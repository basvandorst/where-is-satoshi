I hope that in the case all goes well and Dorian accepts BTC donation, he will also send some BTC to his family (they were also impacted by the article). Delivery of the donation would have to be done carefully, because (in unfortunate set of circumstances) we could cause exactly the thing we want to reimburse him for. Meaning envy from the relatives, neighbors, attention of the media, perhaps risk of some shady pressure on Dorian. (As the fact and process of him receiving quite a sum of money will be "well documented").
I know Andreas that you know this and will try to do it right, but please think about that.

Unfortunately, nobody seems to care. And the situation developed, so now this BIP106 looks like very improbable to win.

Lets look to some scenarios how the numbers (and block size can be fudged). Thinking about malicious "worst-case scenarios" is generally very good way to assess proposals. Please feel free to add scenarios and/or consequences I missed:
1) Big miners want block increase - they want to drive out small miners, increase cost for running full nodes for smaller players, drive out competition  
1a) They can collect as many legitimate transactions as they can and maximally fill the blocks.  
1b) They can collect SPAM transactions or encourage such transactions  
1c) They can construct (oversized and overnumbered) transactions by themselves and self-mine them.  
case 1a) is correct function of miners and beneficial to Bitcoin as transactions are included as soon as possible.  
case 1b) is hindered by second proposal as the SPAM needs to include substantial fees. (This is also reason too much SPAM is uneconomical in current 1MB state. Is there actually better anti-SPAM solution besides combination with dust-prevention at full-node levels?) With continuing push for block size increase, absolute value of SPAM fee in BTC must constantly increase (albeit minimally) to beat previous average, but the number of such transactions (and thus total feecost in BTC) increases geometrically. Full nodes have incentive not to relay such transactions.  
case 1c) Similarly to 1b), miners too must include substantial fees. 1cA: If they announce such monstertxs they will risk that they, including fees, will be stolen from them by other miners (unless having &gt;51% hashpower which is another problem). They can only decrease the cost in ratio of their hashpower, but not eliminate it. 1cB: If they do not announce such transactions and self-mine them. Then the cost in fees is effectively zero. ... But such pools will still have to distribute fees to individual miners, otherwise individual miners will have incentive to choose other pool and{or they will definitely put pressure on pool operators after seeing such large undistributed fees. So the cost stays (and doubles as long as push for increase stays).  
I think only case 1cB needs more elaboration. What if the individual miners are the ones pushing for bigger blocks (not justified by "legitimate" transactions like in 1a)) ? Then they are getting fees back, hmm. But if they do not control more than 51% they can not push block size too much. Or can they?  
Actually, this case needs carefully strict parameters or inclusion of some first proposals to second proposal (like if more than 60% of blocks are above 90% of MaxBlockSize).  
Example: Imagine in the future (reasonable) maxblocksize is 4MB and real, justified mean utilization by legitimate transactions is around 1MB. Then big miners collude and start to generate big blocks with self-mined (fee-returning) transactions. They can not (yet) generate bigger blocks than 4MB, of course, such blocks would be invalid. So very bad case scenario is 50% of miners colluding and generating full 4MB blocks. Then meansize will be suddenly 2.49MB in next period (5008/2008).  
TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty=2008  
TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty=8+1000+4000=5008  
Increase will NOT trigger as (7016/4016)MB&lt;(50% * 4MB)  
...But the miners will continue. Meansize will be 2.49MB even in next following period  
TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty=1004+4016=5020  
TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty=4+16+1000+4000=5020  
Increase WILL§ trigger as (10040/4016)MB&gt;(50% * 4MB)  
§ - "actually in this exact case it will not, because TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty &gt; TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty is not met, but it is easy for miners to hold back in the first period to increase it in the second one."  
Block size will be increased by factor (TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty/TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty) which is close to one.
OK. *Please someone try to design realistic scenario, where big miners can collude to push ever incresing maxblocksize and such push being economically feasible.* I will try one more. (However, in any case where miners are pushing too big blocks, nodes can defend by "soft fork" limit to maxblocksize.)  
What if first push by colluding 50% of miners is by 2MB blocks and second one is by 4MB blocks?  
Then: 1st period: TBSILBOD=2008, TBSILD=3008, NOT trigger; 2nd period: TBSILBOD=3012, TBSILD=4+8+1000+4000=5012, NOT trigger (1.998&lt;2). ... OK, thats too lose. If first push is slightly higher then WILL trigger, but increase factor will be 5012/(3012+epsilon) = 1.65x increase. If in the next 3rd period push is maximal by (new MaxBlockSize) 6.6MB blocks then TBSILD~=7630 and increase will NOT trigger (3.148&lt;50%*6,6). Perhaps with some clever collusion increase can be triggered in the next period but I believe that not so big as 1.65x again. But keep in mind that in addition to that in all situations where increase will not trigger, colluding miners must maintain high fees ~~and~~ or some "nondeflated" mean block size otherwise decrease will trigger instead.
----------------------OK, this is getting too long--------------------  
Perhaps I will split my post and elaborate remaining cases separately tomorrow or later:  
2) Miners want block decrease  
3) Miners want block size freeze. (blocking any changes)  
4) Nodes want block size increase.  
5) Nodes want block size decrease.  
6) Nodes want block size freeze. (blocking any changes)  
Just final remark: Cases 3, 6 seem like no issue, because if they are economical motivated then it is usually more advantageous to straight push for increase or decrease. (Someone who benefits from NOT increasing maxblocksize will usually benefit more by even decreasing it. Someone who benefits from NOT decreasing maxblocksize will usually benefit more by even increasing it.)
However this is not true, because reasons for 3, 6 can be ideological (Bitcoin is what it is and it should stay this way. Lets its [differently and in contradicting ways] perceived flaws be solved by alternate competing solutions/altcoins/sidechains/projects/startups built on the top and around stone-dependable Bitcoin protocol.) There is specific value in stability, predictability and independence on external forces. Like (almost impossible to change) Constitution vs. democracy (applicable to almost everything).
Shall I elaborate further?

Again... I had some new ideas about previous case. So the only threat in the case 2) which I see, is *majority* of miners colluding from *political* reasons in an effort to decrease maxblocksize via 2aA scenario. It would be cost them money, but they can have non-economic incentive. (Like big government agency not caring for money trying to bring Bitcoin into congestion.) This again is similar to current scenarios of government sponsored 51% attack by mining empty blocks only. It is costly, it can not reverse transactions or steal people's BTC, it CAN hinder transactions for some time, it is easily corrected as soon as attack ends. In the case of this BIP-Draft ... well the network would take some more time to recover (in addition to clear backlog, to recover reasonable maxblocksize). So the attack becomes more damaging. However, such attack does not become cheaper or easier with decreasing maxblocksize, there is no positive-feedback. Legitimate miners would have to defend by bringing more hashpower and in really very bad case nodes could defend by consensual imposing minimal value of maxblocksize. This is probably the same defense that would be used today (or some months or years ago). 
Nevertheless I think that some *minimal* value of maxblocksize (like 64kB) should be taken into discussion and **maybe** hardcoded just in case. At least until block subsidy drops considerably and defending economic incentives will rise. Unless someone presents realistic case why smaller blocks would be legitimately needed, 64 kB seems reasonable even for the most conservative voices.  
**A little diversion:** Concerning BIP100 (which is not topic of this thread, but the audience should have large intersection, and it is gaining massive recognition)... I think above-mentioned scenario is a much bigger problem in BIP100, where (mere) 21% of colluding miners can push maxblocksize down. I feel that unless Jeff Garzik clarifies item 9. on the 6th page of his BIP100 proposal, upgrades this mechanism or refutes this risk, BIP100 should include hardcoded minimal value of maxblocksize.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Now the next case...  
3) Miners want maxblocksize freeze - neither increase nor decrease. They value stability and predictability.  
&amp;nbsp;  
3a) and situation (amount of legitimate transactions) calls for neither increase nor decrease  
3b) and situation (amount of legitimate transactions, congestion, fees, waiting times) calls for increase  
3c) and situation (amount of legitimate transactions, full node problems, small miners lags) calls for decrease  
&amp;nbsp;  
case 3a) is not a problem, but a correct equilibrium. Yet, the *interpretation* of where exactly this equilibrium lies and whether it has been achieved is of course another thing. Some people consider even todays situation as "too congested" and point out that it is easy to create backlog by stress test. Some people consider even todays situation as "too much space" and point out that almost every transaction is included, users are not motivated to increase fees and reward miners appropriately, and SPAM is too easy and too cheap to produce. I do not think this can be resolved (objectively).  
However. Can some§ group of miners keep (whichever) maxblocksize from changing? They can observe the trends and try to balance them. If mean block size increase they can mine more sparse blocks and choose juicy-fee transactions only. But they will be in economic disadvantage, because competing miners will include both these juicy-fee transactions *and* large number of other ones. If mean block size decrease they can subsidize SPAM (not for long) or self-mine big txs (with all the problems described in 1cB). Group of miners can also block maxblocksize increase by NOT including fees in their transactions (or choosing free transactions/SPAMsactions/self-generate and mine zero-fee txs). This again is economically unstable and prone to individual miners desertion toward pools focused on higher fee txs. Similarly blocking decrease by generating self-mined fee-rich transactions is somewhat easier. But as in case 1cB, it must be individual large miners who collude and they must have significant hashpower.  
It would actually be very interesting to observe various miners interplay and interaction in an effort to balance each other's push.  
§ - very large majority of miners can of course enforce soft-fork as always, nothing new here.  
case 3b) is economically unstable from the reasons stated in 3a). Moreover there are high fees and high incentive to grab those transactions.  
case 3c), well it looks that blocking maxblocksize decrease is easier than blocking maxblocksize increase. The way is creating big txs. Oops, that is bad, because those do not have to be fee-rich and self-mined. While it is necessary to have *both* big blocks and high fees to push maxblocksize increase, it suffices to have only one of these to hinder decrease. High-fee transactions must be self-mined by colluding individual miners (otherwise they would be bleeding money), but large txs with small fees can be announced freely.  
Full nodes can still defend by soft-fork rejecting large blocks en masse. But whether it would be enough, I do not know.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Maybe there is a problem. Blocking decrease in maxblocksize is easier than blocking increase and also easier than pushing increase. So as soon as miners push maxblocksize increase (which is not so easy), maintaining it is in fact easier. It might still be too difficult, though.  
I have seen a proposal somewhere (do not remember which BIP it was) that maxblocksize should gradually decrease because of this asymmetry. (Such as if there is no change in maxblocksize for several periods [like 2-3 months] then maxblocksize will start to automatically decrease by 5% every period. This decrease will be ~~stopped~~ reversed as soon as legitimate transactions would require it. But it would be difficult for malicious colluding miners to reverse this on their own. While mere blocking is easier.)  
&amp;nbsp;  
Only cases 4,5,6 concerning nodes remain.  
----Phew, I think that before I finish this, some BIP would be probably already in place :-)----

I was thinking about case 1cB more. And I found another counterargument. It is actually easily refuted, but it should be examined: Big Miners will not fill their blocks with self-mined not-announced fee-rich monstertxs, because they would exhaust space for ordinary transactions.  
In the time where coinbase reward will be small and fees will be the main source of miner's ~~income~~ reward for securing the network, they would have incentive to include legitimate fee-paying txs instead of self-mined fee-neutral ones.  
Unfortunately, this is not so relevant. We are speaking of case 1c) where big miners want to push maxblocksize well above size sufficient for legitimate transactions. So they can include every legitimate transaction anyway and only after that fill the rest of the block with self-mined monstertxs. However, they have to (have incentive to) constantly update their block with newly incoming legitimate transactions and evict self-mined ones. Whereas fair miners just add the newly incoming. I do not know if it gives colluding miners some significant disadvantage.  
We shall return to this case further. For now it seems to me that some hardcoded limit to maxblocksize (which can not be beaten by 50% or 70% of colluding miners) is needed. Perhaps the one from BIP100, where 90% of miners must "vote" and agree for 3 months to increase it.  
&amp;nbsp;  
So lets look at other scenarios.  
2) Miners want block size decrease - they hope that constricted space will force Bitcoin users to increase fees significantly and they want exercise (political) power in excluding certain transactions or offering "not excluding them" for  ~~ransom~~ payment.  
2a) They can mine empty (or almost empty) blocks  
2b) They can ignore bigger blocks and enforce personal soft limit  
&amp;nbsp;  
case 2a) is economically disadvantageous as soon as coinbase reward drops and fees are the main income. Individual miners have incentive to switch pool to get some bigger reward (from non-empty blocks) in the present time instead of some unsure reward (caused by constricted blocks) in the future. Moreover, if the miners somehow succeed in making the block space constricted *and* fees increased then the mechanism in the proposal will very soon increase maxblocksize again.  
2aA: If after decrease high fees are blocked by miners (in an attempt to hinder maxblocksize increase back) then they did not achieve profit from constricted block space.  
2aB: If after decrease block space is not made constricted/full by miners (in an attempt to hinder maxblocksize increase back), but high fees are required by miners to include txs then we have something which is possible even in current situation (with 1MB fixed maxblocksize). Competition makes such collusion (cartel setting minimal fee for inclusion) unstable as individual miners/pools have incentive to be the first one to cheat and grab big chunk of just-a-little-lower-fee transactions.  
case 2b) is effectively a attempt to soft-fork. Miners set their own limit for block size and ignore bigger blocks. More than 50% must collude to enforce this soft-fork as the longest chain. This situation is also unstable (regulated by market forces) due to increase in fees and incentive for miners to include such juicy txs. Again, this is nothing new in comparison with current situation where very small blocks can be theoretically enforced by soft-fork, but they are not (750kB is not too small and it works, 75kB would probably fail quickly).  
The situation 2b) where e.g. 80% of miners accept only small blocks is very different from situation 2a) where small blocks are "compulsory" by decreasing maxblocksize. Former situation is unstable because anyone from the remaining 20% hashpower can mine bigblock and full nodes (merchants, exchanges, individuals) will happily accept it and propagate it and can even tempt the 80% by building fee-rich transactions on this bigblock.  
&amp;nbsp;  
3) Miners want maxblocksize freeze - neither increase nor decrease. They value stability and predictability.  
3a) and situation (amount of legitimate transactions) calls for neither increase nor decrease  
3b) and situation (amount of legitimate transactions, congestion, fees, waiting times) calls for increase  
3c) and situation (amount of legitimate transactions, full node problems, small miners lags) calls for decrease

Hallo Simon,
I registered here on reddeit because of this thread... I do not want you to become victim of your own enthusiasm and popularity of your exchange. I consider you to be trustworthy and btc24 is a great service. 
However, I also want my money and bitcoins back like many others. I suppose we should wait a while. Lets hope your lawyer gives you a go for your statement. If you behave honestly, I hope there will be many people who will stay with your service and even pay some fees so you can cover your losses. I certainly will. But you must admit that it was your fault, your incompetence and compensate people first. I wish that some of the people who got rich by using flaws in your service would also help in keeping the service alive. But not all of them will do, some will want to keep their unfairly earned money. And you will have to compensate. 
Keep communicating, honest and fair and I believe it will turn out well and show resiliency of bitcoin.
Good luck and steel nerves!
