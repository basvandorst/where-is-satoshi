Isn't this a great way to send money to someone who lives abroad? Say, you live in Europe and earn Euros which you want to send to your family in Uganda. You give your family the card with the PIN and simply top up the the card with BTC that you bought in Europe. Your family can easily withdraw from a VISA card whereas it is usually hard to convert BTC into a fiat currency in many countries. 
Is there an even better way maybe?

So they do nothing more than to bet on the future price of BTC against... each other? What happens if the bets that it's going to increase (longs?) do not sum up to the bets that it's going to fall (shorts?) on the day of settlement? Doesn't someone have to *own* Bitcoin (so they can exchange for $ if necessary) in order to be able to bet on its price?

Since there doesn't seem to be any compression going on, does this effectively mean a blocksize increase? Does it "exploit" the blocksize measuring method which only looks at transaction data and not witness data? I know that people have been using "block weight" instead of "block size" but I haven't yet figured out which is which.

Thanks man, I just tried it and it literally took half a second for a payment. I figured that if a significant amount of day to day transactions convert to lightning and the blockchain is being used mostly as a settlement layer, we could probably get the effective number of bitcoin transactions so low that fees on both layers would eventually be pretty low compared to now. This means that also opening and closing ln channels would be pretty cheap. I think we as a community will learn from this current crisis and I'm pretty positive about the future.

Bitcoin is political, whether you like it or not. It takes away power from the money makers, who at the same time are tightly related to the policy makers. The whole point of Bitcoin is decentralization, so you could argue that pushing the whole point of Bitcoin is pushing decentralization which is taking away power from preexisting centralized monetary systems, which makes it political. 
So in a sense, I have the impression that you are bound to be political, no matter if you use Bitcoin or Fiat.

No matter how much I appreciate your effort but this chart is utter nonsense to me. It compares apples to oranges all the way down. $14 "transaction cost" you call it? 
Why would you compare "money miners earned" (Bitcoin) to "money merchands spent" (Paypal)?! It's just wrong to do. And it's certainly not "transaction cost" in the case of Bitcoin. The average transaction cost in Bitcoin should be the average fee and it has nothing to do with the miner reward (except maybe inflation caused by minting of new coins). That's all!
And as others have pointed out, you seem to have no idea what "transaction time" really means in the context of Bitcoin compared to Paypal.

@_date: 2017-08-06 21:54:20
Apart from the fact that you can measure Bitcoin's relatively high volatility there are several risks which could seriously damage Bitcoin:
* Market cap is still very small, very big players could just manipulate the price as they wish (already happening) and crash the market. 
* Serious hash-power attacks from governments or alike could 51% attack the network and thus crash the market.
* Critical bugs in the Bitcoin protocol (not that we know of any) could crash the market. 
* Satoshi moving his 1m coins could crash the market.
* ... probably more I can't think of.
I'm not saying that cryptocurrencies in general will fail though, they will be with us for a long time, I'm sure. And they should therefore increase in value. However a single cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is not invincible but could/will be replaced by something better in case of emergency. 
I recommend constantly keeping an eye on what's happening and generally letting your whole life be sucked in by the cult around it and become a crypto addict.
Edit: Seriously, don't invest everything at once. Lay out an investment plan for the next 1-2 years or so and constantly buy and hodl (be perpared to hodl for &gt;5 yrs). That's the safest thing you can do if you want to get in.

Why would the post be an "attack"? It's clear that individuals are spamming the mempool and we've seen in the past that they won't stop after 0-fee transactions. 
I think the temporal pattern (when they come and disappear, like Aug 01) of these transactions is interesting. It's ok if you don't see it like that.
Edit: for anyone interested, look at the 3 month graph, that's how full the mempool was a couple of months ago:

It's not about an increase in $ but an increase in % that is news-worthy. Imagine you'd have to write an article for every 1000$ increase, it will become pretty boring soon since the absolute price doesn't affect the change in % a lot. 
Like for every 100$ increase we post that fucking rollercoaster meme, at some point it just doesn't work anymore and we have to switch to 500$ steps.

Most of the spam is &lt;5 sat/byte so it's the cheapest attack possible. I didn't look into the distribution of those transactions but I guess there will be lot's of 0 fee transactions as well so that's basically for free.

It means, if you buy bitcoin on an exchange or anywhere, you should put them into your own wallet ASAP and back up the keys etc (you can find more info on how to secure your wallet).

It's how the future will work IMO. I'll probably hodl my Bitcoin until I die and every time I want to buy a coffee or a lambo, I'll convert it to Monero or Litecoin or some other alt to do my business and at the end of the day I'll just convert all the change back to Bitcoin so I can sleep well. 
It will truly be a zoo of cryptos and everyone can accept whichever coin they want, I don't even care as long as I can convert from and to everything in an instant.

Absolutely, there is no reason to pay upfront for a house if you own that much. If you wanna buy a house for say $350k, I would set aside 100 BTC ("lock them") and sell them as soon as BTC drops below 3.5k (or whatever remains to be payed for your house). If BTC doesn't drop, just borrow the money from the bank and pay the interest off a ±25 BTC stack.

Buying stuff and thus producing stuff that nobody needs won't help anyone in the long run. Wasteful consumerism is a sickness that is being marketed to us in a inflationary monetary system. We pay by printing money, creating huge wastelands, millions of useless jobs and by ripping the planet's resources. 
The value that Bitcoin has today is mostly due to it's scarcity (and all the other neat features ofc) which makes it a perfect *store* of value. I'm not saying that I wouldn't love to able to easily convert my BTC into other goods (products or $$$) but hodling to it and using an exchange in case I want to buy something is not really going to stop to increase its value.

@_date: 2019-06-30 01:32:03
There are several factors to consider:
* Small blocks means less network traffic, disk storage, CPU and RAM 
 necessary to process the block chain, making it possible to run a full node on a... coffee machine? Kidding, on a Raspberry Pi for example. Why is this good? This ensures that everyone can afford running a node which makes the whole network more decentralised and thus more secure for everyone.
* Technologies (adoption) usually don't scale linearly over time. Increasing the block size would only help so much until the mempool is full again. We are nowhere near full adoption so it is to be expected that the number of users will go up by a lot. There is no realistic block size that could allow for transaction speeds of today's credit card networks for example. This is basically a given due to the decentral architecture of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The current best way to handle the scarcity of block space is to let users "compete" for block space by paying fees.
* Then there are several more technical problems related to block propagation speeds and stuff that is a bit over my head but the arguments are [summarised here]( as quoted somewhere below.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:38:03
It's how a coin with limited supply is supposed to work. At one point block reward will be very low and transactions will cost money from fees. Don't believe what all the alt inventors will tell you, every crypto depends on fees to maintain security. There is no such thing as free crypto transactions and the reason most coins are cheaper than BTC is because they have only a fraction of transactions. 
To fairly compare two coins they'd need to have the same number of users and transactions. It's like a country like Denmark telling the US "look how little we need to spend on military, life can be so peaceful". Well yeah, things look a bit different if your country has ~60x more citizens. Don't know if that analogy makes sense.

This might be when initially downloading the blockchain but nowhere near the operation bandwidth of a full node. Yesterday for example, my node had a total traffic of 8.34 GiB, for all of February it is estimated at 72.74 GiB. That's is really not that much if you have a proper DSL line.

@_date: 2019-04-02 07:39:25
I don't get this kind of argument. Are you saying the bitcoin price somehow remembers its state a few months ago? Absolute price values are less indicative than percentual changes so why would I be interesred in the price a few months ago? Momentum is momentum.

Theoretically, this is also the electricity you'd have to spend in order to carry out a 51% attack. (Not mentioning the ~£183,600,000 in hardware that you'd have to possess). That's a fairly good firewall for now, I guess....

Good thing about crypto is (and many people won't accept that) that it might be a short-term bubble but you know what I don't fucking care about you making or losing money, for me it's still magic internet money that is a big *fuck you* to all banks and institutions so I still love it and I'll buy more as long as I live :P

This sounds like a great alternative to proof of work! Never thought of it but it makes a lot sense. Especially because storage hardware is probably easier to acquire for the most part of the world because it is generally available and used everywhere on the planet (in contrast to specialized ASICs). This proof-of-space algorithm probably uses way less energy than calculating billions of SHA hashes per second. Also, I can't imagine how you would have special HDD's similar to how ASICs popped up, so that's good!
If the speed scales linearly with storage space and if the algorithm is as safe as the current POW, I hope we will see a coin with this algo soon!
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:21:42
Didn't read the paper but I strongly assume: No. There are algorithms that just require a certain amount of space to calculate the next iteration or something. You can't cheat that. I don't know what algorithm is used in this case though.

This is my biggest concern with Bitcoin and I'm always surprised how little this gets the attention it deserves. Privacy-wise it's the worst kind of money that you could imagine. Sure, there are techniques such as tumbling or Monero with ring-signatures that really solve the problem but in the Bitcoin space (or the whole rest of crypto) nobody seems to give a fuck whether all their financial activity is traceable or not :D Please correct me if I missed something.

Dude sorry to be the partypooper but get it out of your head. Bitcoin wasn't *intendet* as a system to pay for Amazon. It is a proof of concept of an immutable decentralized ledger and it works like a charm. But please understand, it was *intended* as a system to securely exchange value without banks being involved and not to do your grocery shopping. If you want an app on that system, you gotta build it or just wait and not complain about it. (Because it changes people's expectations and only shit comes out at the end (*BCash*).)

@_date: 2017-10-23 08:41:54
This comment is long and elaborate but in some parts short-sighted or misguided. I appreciate your effort to write up such a large body of text and share it with us but I believe that if you invest such an amount of energy in sharing your ideas it might be worthwhile providing sources or at least the rationale behind many of your "givens". 
I am referring to parts like *"but there will never be a time when people say a 2 carat diamond is worth nothing, because it is nice looking piece of object that is worth at least something"* or *"as a "systemic bank run" is simply impossible to achieve in the bitcoin world"*. 
Sorry if I sound arrogant by pointing this out but I believe you can come over as much more convincing if you don't state your *core arguments* as facts but rather as a result of a reasoning which you guide the reader through.

You know what correlation is right? It's a pretty precise mathematical thing that doesn't give a damn about your opinion actually. So yeah, it's pretty fucking correlated.
Edit: smh. The people in this thread. It is correlated, whether you like it or not, whether you like the time frame or not, whether you think they are casually linked or not. People, I say it again, IT IS NOT UP FOR DEBATE, put the two curves into Matlab and fucking calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and let me rest in peace. Fucking noobs.

Yes, in the near future the Moon will support Bitcoin payments as well!
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:22:56
He never said that but still a nice rhetorical move ;)

Well to be fair, a stochastic process with higher variance is more likely to hit the bottom...
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:31:14
How does it work? Does a single person controlling the pool just turn a knob and all hashpower from that pool is used for a SW block or is it more of a "voting" mechanism of individual miners?
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:58:28
You've got money!
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:37:23
please enlighten us 
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:53:38
A black leather one?
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:59:05
You mean you can't receive?
@_date: 2017-07-10 00:26:52
What's a block increase?
@_date: 2017-07-10 00:10:28
There should be a tool where you can easily calculate the weighted integral of that curve of a given time span to find out how much money someone is pulverizing there...
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:35:17
Some people have principles and plans, you know. It's not always panic.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:16:40
Is this true?
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:05:42
I love you.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:54:28
which projects?
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:58:42
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:17:37
It was so nice and definitely one of the best apps for bitcoin to date! So many people were tipping here. It's so sad that there is no replacement for it, at least none that I know of. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:33:04
That's nice 
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:11:10
Agree on everything you say. One thing that still bugs me though is proof of work requiring so much electricity causing lots of CO2. If someone came up with a method of limiting the block speed while not wasting huge amounts of energy, pls tell us, we want it.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:25:50
Maybe that's the future Morpheus see when talks about that one day we'd not have to exchange out btc to fiat anymore.
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:00:43
With a font size of 6pt? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:30:56
You are right about him being pretty WTF but SegWit is a lot more than just faster (on-chain/off-chain) transactions. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:03:59
But cute
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:41:23
Do you know what that means? Can it only send to wallets which have receive enabled?
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:59:15
Ok pls let's not do this. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:18:53
How is it pronounced correctly? Not English native speaker here.
@_date: 2017-07-08 17:07:25
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:40:54
You can open a channel by swiping to the right screen and then add a channel for a specific amount. It seems that you can only SEND via the channel and not receive. I have no idea how that should work though...
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:11:52
Any other nodes that I can connect to to open a few payment channels?
@_date: 2019-05-09 07:03:41




@_date: 2017-07-05 23:10:03
Yes, it's a sincere attempt to gain more insight. If you know more about the issue, let us know!
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:14:41
It takes 0.5 seconds for my node to announce a tx to all other nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:08:36
I recognize that not everyone agrees, however, I am not aware of any even mildly convincing arguments from the "other side" against SW. Please let me know if you do.
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:20:16


Why would you call that an argument? It's a fact. And who cares about what you think is fair or not or what the buildings downtown use in electricity? I'm just saying that it's using a lot of energy and I am convinced that a low-energy version of it would be better and I'm sure you'd agree. Why would you defend an undefendable position?
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:24:19
woah. thanks, I didn't check. 
Edit: still faster than my bank! :)
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:13:39
Wtf u talking about? The only alternative to Bitcoin is CC, Paypal and other high-fee/high-fraud payment models. Ever made a wire transfer for online shopping? It can take *days*. You can go ahead and make a Bitcoin tx with 100 sat/byte fee **right now** and you will have your 6 confirmations in 30-60 minutes. 
Just bitter shitposters left in this sub with virtually nothing to add to the discussion...

I just checked out Wasabi, it looks very cool!
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:33:53
go buy more pls
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:43:18
Thanks for the graph. It is certainly linear though. There is a hard size limit for each block's size (I think around 3.7 MB theoretically) so it would grow at maximum that speed. If you look at the graph, the last third of the growth is basically linear.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:26:40
He's trying to say that just because he knows how to sell drugs on his website doesn't make him a crypto pro.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:29:47
Coincidently, in times where the price pumps like now, a dubious amount of exchanges get "hacked".
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:38:16

What about PayPal? Wouldn't you call it spending Dollars or Euros but PayPal coin? No.
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:24:25
Didn't change much for a few days. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 09:21:31
You have a very simple world view, I'm jealous.
@_date: 2019-05-17 08:16:13
Interested in this as welllllll
@_date: 2017-07-10 00:13:30
I also had a couple of (now very expensive) pizzas paid with btc back in the day. It makes you realize in a certain way that  Bitcoin is actually real... :)
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:23:47
This is still all very fishy to me until someone else confirms that this actually works. I downloaded the extension, the LN option is~~n't~~ available for me ~~(yet?)~~. Anyway, I want to know how they make any money doing this. Does anyone know? [In this article]( they say: 


How does that make money, do they avoid the VISA/CC fees (somehow)? Does the Amazon costumer pay VISA fees even if they "don't apply" like with Moon? Or do they act as a CC payment service? So many fucking question marks...
**Edit:** Also, why is there basically none of this info on [their website]( They have exactly only one landing page with fancy icons but no explanation whatsoever. They are even suspiciously vague in the interview about this:


Even in the Chrome Webstore answers to reviews, they only refer you to their support team but don't answer basic questions... As much as I'd like to be happy to see this product, ***I WON'T TRUST THEM MY BROWSER, MY AMAZON ACCOUNT, AND MY BTC UNTIL THEY ARE MORE TRANSPARENT.***
tl,dr: absolutely no info about the company available, they doge basic questions, do not trust them your crypto until they act more transparently

Ads! Hope you get banned for this.
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:13:48
I always wonder where redditors like you come up with accurate on-point data when a topic like this pops up. I mean, did you just write a report and had those numbers anyways? Or do you have the price history loaded in a spreadsheet because you're a trader and you just wrote some script to find the 9k crossings? Hehe, thanks anyways!

Idk, aren't you a Linguistics Professor? Now I know your email, address, office location and office hours, I can see your computer, you leave it open and unprotected sometimes. It's pretty useless to defend your irresponsible behavior with "I trust their security". The problem is not coinbase's security practice here, the problem is YOUR sense of security. 95% of all hacks are social hacks and you're being a pretty fucking easy target right now. Believe what you want, people trying to give you some good advice here.
