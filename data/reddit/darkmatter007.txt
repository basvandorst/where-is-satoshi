you think too less of people. or you are underestimating. Indeed they dont trade real bitcoins and so on.
But the person who has bitcoins and sold them for a certain value benefits of a lower price (he can buy them back). So everyone is thinking that the people who have allot of bitcoins are just manipulating the market into lower pricing.
Or do you think miners just hoard bitcoin for years without selling &gt;?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:12:25
omg this will indeed tank the price happend couple of years ago also with silk road sell-off
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:05:10
wait till it drops. your happiness will be gone like snow in the summer
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:44:11
Can be...but also people who have know they are in a bubble right now...
Just ask yourself one question...what is changed last half year except for the price ? We still have the same problems (mining monopolies,slow transactions = not really scale-able).
So yeah we are probably in a bubble especially when everyone who only knows how to turn on a pc starts to buy bitcoins.

I think (and hope) most people know that futures can't own bitcoins. But that is not the issue where I am afraid of. I will tell you what I am afraid of:
1) They will promote the short futures because they have the money that will cause panic and bad media attention so "the average joe" will remove his money/interest in bitcoin
2) Let's say they short. Do you think they will sit on their asses and hope something will happen ? With their money they can really set up SELL-Walls and short with real bitcoin (exchange bitcoins XD) to cause the market to drop. I want to see how you will react when they put a sell wall for 5000 bitcoins each time.
Face it...we are not professional traders and we dont have their money. If most were in bitcoin for some utopia reason then you are right nothing will happen....but most are in to get more USD.

I dont know if you can do this but give it a "weighted" addition to the value...
I mean an exchange with 2% volume should not dictate the same value as some that has 10% volume... :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:24:03
Anyway I see allot of noobs loving meme's and calling everything FUD or all that kiddie names. I am just saying history can repeat it self. I only have 0.5 bitcoin stuck in exchange all my other coins are offline and I will see what happens... but I already accepted that bitcoin is going up and down
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:53:55
I think you have a too optimistic idea of the whole "institutional money"
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:43:56
BCH will tank too if that happens
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:29:36
10 usd is not high :') if that is the future we can skip crypto because those fees already exist (and cheaper) in current fiat systems
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:36:10
Does it matter if they are sold or auctioned ? In the end everyone was thinking it will be sold. It will cause the same panic the person who buys them wants to sell them for profit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:35:05
I invest in alts and there are a couple with really interesting tech. But don't kid yourself.
The money that is poured in all the alt-coins is only because of coverage and so on on bitcoin this was the same in 2013. 
If (when) there is a crash and people start losing money...you think they come back and invest in altcoins ? It's even funnier you think that all that money is because people know anything about crypto's and stuff like that.
They just know bitcoin makes money so they invest and same for other coins

start reading about iOTA. I was a big fan a week ago... after allot of reading I started to realize IOTA had a good run with marketing but that was it. Nothing real released, wallet has bugs, issues that people stated about the logic of the whole tech behind it is burried in closed source code.
I really hope it will work out but read all the questions and blogs that people with allot of knowledge said about it... I don't think they can live up to their words... and yes all those big companies they are saying "we are partnering and are interested" but that doesn't mean anything till they have anything to work with...
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:46:54
Bitfinex has the biggest wallet. Don't believe they will go down easily. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:33:36
Some internal stuff has been pushed for later. And a couple of stress tests have been done. But what about real world use cases ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:00:08
try the "futures" in google trend... there is a difference with the time before (before '0' and in may spike to '2')
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:52:32
Also change the page 'Title' to the 'Fair value' each update... that way people can keep it open as tab and just see the changes on the tab 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:35:33
there is almost no volume on the trades... I think most are just by the sidelines today after yesterday...
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:49:36
I hate the hodl and hold meme's 
Even in 2013 it was not a freakshow like now.
But if I holded I would have
2500 LTC and 8 BTC
Too bad I didn't hold because now I have
108 BTC (and all its forks) and 0 LTC
You would think it's awsome but its not... I can't sleep anymore and I don't know what to do. I wanted to sell at 8k but it still goes up.
Thank god I only have like 0.5 bitcoin on a exchange because I never bothered to get the usb's with the wallets out of my shoe in the closet.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:54:17
I always had the idea that people who say this didn't had allot of money on the table.
When it moves a dollar and you lose 50 usd its different story
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:30:50
they can't short now ? they can still short....but a bigger dip is ofcourse much better...
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:10:26
you know what happend in 2013 ? the dip was 3 years lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:45:38
I am also afraid of this.... I don't care about all the other alt's but this will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:39:31
Come on man nobody guessed this would happen. You should let go of that feeling in hindsight its easy to say everything.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:36:41
watching from the sideline...
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:36:04
You want people to pay 30 USD to pay your goods ? Haha
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:27:21
you can't use it like that or you want to say bitcoin is like snow ? 0_0
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:13:57
Scam how ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:56:35
I dont like BCH because of miners monopoly but trusting Blockstream and the LN is also not wise when you read all the facts...
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:25:25
yeah but there is no date how did you get a date ?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:54:55
The people who are pushing the prices now are exactly the ones that are going to short.
But let me tell you who will short the most ?
Miners can safely short and get their money out.
Lets just hope that exchanges dont go down in the proces
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:32:01
officially they can't with the futures yes but that doesn't stop there or are you this naieve to think they will wait without trying to influnce the market to make sure their future contract will make profit ? In such a small cap as bitcoin that is peanuts.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:44:37
tbh i just liked the "game" of mining it was fun with so many gpu's trying to do something about the heat ah well that were the days now everything ASIC... not as fun anymore also the price gives bitcoin other "meaning" but I dont know you but if you take that kind of risks you probably also that on the markets.... just beware... even professional traders know they have to cash out profits instead of waiting on every new high
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:29:12
Max: 20k
Min: 2.5k
probably around 5k
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:16:45
you should stop drinking the rocket fuel bitcoin is on.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:24:59
only a fool thinks that bitcoin will not drag altcoins down with it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:30:25
they will wait on the dips like anyone with allot of money would have done...
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:36:45
Bitcoin is not a scam. the shit around it is. I was talking about the pump as a scam to dump it on our head.
Anyway only time will tell right ? lets get back at this in 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:53:38
You didn't take block difficulty in consideration. You will get lesser coins over time. Also you don't know if after 1 year the 0.35 value is more than the 0.25 value of today. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:21:10
you know nothing is regulated right ? who says they didnt buy last half year just to start selling around now after they "sign" the contracts.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:18:51
lol i think we want more people to use bitcoin or what you want a currency or commodity only tradeable with 3 people ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:06:17
Not if they control the coins they bought last half year. Then they are the ones who are "pumping" and "dumping"
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:38:10
I have BTC on my wife's website but more for a gimmick. No one ever used it and with these prices I don't expect any sane person to pay ever haha
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:36:29
Cool! but is there a reason why you didn't add bitfinex ? its only one of the biggest atm ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:47:48
I am on dollar don't know if I have to buy or short 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:25:42
totally true...the same people that will start shouting when the price crashes that it's all fake and stuff like that...been there done that...in the end we are laughing right...
oh and please dont keep too much bitcoin in exchanges... i only have 0.5 on bitfinex and I am already afraid what will happen when there will be a crash
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:10:07
believe me its not worth it only if you are going to create a coin and you need hash power to get the coins out without premine
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:01:14
is this for real ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:56:50
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:33:53
I would never do that...never take a loan for investing and in something so risky as this...
It worked out great thats good but it could have completly wrong...I mined most of my coins for years I didn't really bought coins but I sold what I mined for the fee (renting space) in hindsight that was not so smart :P (almost 2 bitcoins a month) for 2 years lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:24:27
big money going to short btc ? :|
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:44:57
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:34:33
they will sell hidden and then setup a sell wall of 1000 btc right above your head. -&gt; panic
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:17:55
dude stop panicking you are only making it worse :\ they just have some issues because of noobs panicking 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:28:07
Thanks :) I will do that...
