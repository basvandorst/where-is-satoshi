Virtually everyone did this. It was the only viable way to maintain a stable balance.
One day, the 100$ worth of zim dollars would be $25 the next. It was the definition of insanity.
My father would literally carry a suitcase of money to buy eggs, bread ect. Since online banking was not prevalent in the country. This lead to increased uncertainty and basically matrial law.
One of the earliest memories I have is my parents locking me and my brother in a room and telling us to wait there while they spoke to a policeman who just wandered up the driveway.
Zimbabwe used to be a place without crime, if someone saw another person passed out on the floor with money next to him, he/she would put a blanket over him. That was the country I grew up in.
The recession was more than the loss of money, it was the loss of life, and the loss of the most beautiful country I have ever known

Farms where taken (often by force) by the military owned by whites and given to others. This broke my heart because Zimbabwe was never meant to be about "white" and "black". 
This eventually lead to a massive collapse when the people now owning the farms had no idea how to farm, causing the food supply to drop significantly and the economy to spiral down.

Banks printed them out, you'd have to stand there for hours. Banks runs were a regular occurrence, hence the need to exchange for USD

My family and I had to resort to the black market in order to stay financially stable, at best.
