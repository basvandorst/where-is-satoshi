Dude, remember when bitcoin hit its ath at 2400 a couple of months back? I was buying and selling in Korea for 3600, also was selling eth for 450 for 2 days straight.
They've done this before and I didn't hear you complain when bitcoins price was pumping.
This is no pump and dump, guy

Can't end users workaround replay attacks by moving their coins on one chain to another address they control?
Sure it's inconvenient but isn't that what we should expect with forks.

Do you mean 2x is bitcoin gold?

Ok some doubt uncertainty and fear coming up

Hey just because core don't want to add replay protection doesn't mean you should try and force them to.
Same goes for the 2x guys in my opinion.

It was just a cheeky tickle to remind us it was there

No, we are not insane :-) the market is though, compared to other ones
They are right to call it a dip - call it what you want but to us a crash means 50-75pc value wipeout for a sustained period. See end of 2014.
The key word in your quote is significant.
For someone who got in during the last crash, this dip (which hasnt finished by the way - shorts are being squeezed) may represent a buying opportunity if it goes down - would need to be a lot more for me personally.

Be careful where you plug that, Mcaffee.

Arrogant? Yes
Nutters? Maybe
Much much richer than two years ago? Usually

Psst. It's ok, a contingency has been made.

Yes but don't put it all in at once.
