Meditation 100%
Being present is actual really difficult but quieting your mind is the best way to do so. I recommend "headspace's" guided meditations to help you begin. I've been meditation steadily for about 2 months and the results are impeccable. I feel more in tune. I get angry less and I can just enjoy being. I still find it difficult to be present in the moment but I practice not letting my mind run rampant and taking in as much of an experience as I can.

Use a debit card instead of a bank account! It's instant. I've doesn't this a couple of times.
You could be in trouble if the price drops low and stays lower than the price your bought in at. But I estimate that even after the bubble burst or short sell from the futures next week Bitcoin will bounce back. Maybe one day we'll look back when it is a 100000 and be estatic we bought in now.

Evidence it will bounce back after Bitcoin hype is over? I think this may be good option

That makes sense. I understand how mining works but I was confused on why their was fees because to my knowledge one of the goals of bitcoin was to be able to make transactions without a third party (reducing fees) but even without a third party we are paying fees. So what do we do to fix this? Is more miners the answer?

Lol yeah, but nothing positive about it though

I began hearing about this yesterday. I'm a couple weeks into learning about crypto. What is txn and I thought the point of Bitcoin was to avoid fees. I know steam dropped them because of this. What is causing the fees?
You're right though. This is more like a stock than a currency atm
