Yes but in that scenario which is higly speculative, they bought 588 btc for 10 millions (10 millions/17000).   Tomorrow the market opens.... they will have to cover there losses as well since we are now at 14k/btc if they decide to unloads all there coins... so in order to come out even on that trade they would havr to make more than 588x3000 on the futures...  that sounds like a pretty huge bet when you only havr 588 bitcoins.
Im sure im missing something but .... thats how i dont panic tonight!

Last 3 months inflation was about 3% (a little high) but I dont consider this being it by inflation... we actually have inflation because the economy is doing well and the unemployment is at its lowest point in decades.
