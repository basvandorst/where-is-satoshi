"If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs . . .
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting . . .
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim . . .
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you...
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it."

�� **Twitter reacts to Bill Gates 'Nonsense' crypto comments quote:**
*"Right now cryptocurrencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs and cryptocurrencies is super risky for those who go long."*
1. Sounds like BillGates joins the list of "Old man yells at Bitcoin". Bitcoin is causing deaths.
2. Bill Gates just said cryptocurrencies have caused many “deaths in a fairly direct way.” Then he spewed the normal nonsense about funding terrorism &amp; money laundering. I’m starting to think the criteria for being old and rich is hating crypto �� they’ll all learn eventually.
3. ....it's not anonymous and the concerns aren't exclusive to digital assets. Every currency funds terrorism, is laundered and leads to deaths. 
Replace "cryptocurrency" with "USD" when most of this fear mongering occurs and the statements are still true.
4. If y'all had 90 billion dollars would y'all really DYOR on some internet money scheme? I ain't mad at ya BillGates.

Stock market crashing,  fiat currencies like dollar losing strength...  Still feeling sceptical of crypto??
No,  I m not sceptical of crypto. 
I m sceptical of the people who entered cryptos. 
Those who map the tech assets like cryptos on 15min charts without knowing what is the purpose of that crypto asset!
Cryptos will flourish and with greater resilience, but the people (who called themselves early adopters)  wouldn't. 
The level of conversation in early 2017 in each group or over on twitter was way better than the last 4 months. 
&amp; I bet after this mayhem,  the levels of conversation will again Go up.  
People need a kick to be alive. 
Otherwise, they become zombies in there character, need more without effort.

No one will ever carry around a cell phone when there's a pay phone on every corner.
No one will ever buy things online because they prefer to see them in person.
Bitcoin won't succeed because it isn't backed by a government.

HODLing is hard, and it is especially difficult if you put an absurdly large portion of your portfolio into the bitcoin and cryptocurrency market.
If you expect an asset to go up by 30~40% overnight, as crypto did in December, expect it to fall by 30~40% overnight as well.

Nowdays, hexadecimals have broader acceptance but it is extremely hard to remember... That's why for wallets that support BIP39 
 Mnemonic phrases are being developed to make it much easier to remeber...

Support for the Bitcoin scalability upgrade Segregated Witness (SegWit), which is designed to make transaction fees slower and transactions times faster on the Bitcoin network, was added to the latest Bitcoin Core client version released on Feb. 15, 2018.
SegWit support was also added to major exchange Bitfinex on February 21st, and scheduled to be released on the exchange and wallet platform Coinbase by next week.
This is why we're starting to see lower Bitcoin transaction fees and transactions getting confirmed faster. SegWit is a big step for Bitcoin's development, everyone's been waiting for it since years ago and it's finally here. 
These are good news for Bitcoin as a blockchain in general, since we know that the biggest problem Bitcoin has it's the fees and slow confirmation times. That's why I think this is a big step forward.

Don’t ever think in less than 10 year increments for anything you invest it financially 
Leave it to others to do the short term stuff 
Long game is anti fragile wealth 
Short game is for those not mature enough to play long game

Tbh, He confirmed what I thought about 99% of the projects coming out of China lol.
They seem to have a model of claiming that they can do 1M+ TPS, some sort of staking consensus, and a slightly modified version/idea that already existed. 
Most common form: DAPP creation
And they always have the government's blessing in some way, shape or form.
And staking is a major part of the use case. 
I will say this - Chinese blockchain scams are very thorough in the set up of the scam.
