Who gets to decide who has a bounty on their head? Roger Ver does? So this is his personal justice site? Anyone who has annoyed him gets a bounty. Great! That IS justice. 
Unless any bounty can be submitted then voted on as valid or not by the community this is just Roger Ver's personal targets site. Once a bounty on the site creator's head can be submitted and community approved then this will be worth looking at.
Additionally, profit should never be the motivator for law enforcement. That's how we've fallen into our current predicament. Incentives for illegal seizures and an entire host of other problems.
Edit: Actually, I'm going to revise this on thinking about it. Bounties in general for hackers are poor practice. They generate incentives for false convictions. In the world of digital forensics there is already so much that can go wrong. That's why so many of these cases go unsolved. Modifying log files takes two seconds with an editor. All the evidence is far more malleable than anything physical. This is a horrible idea all around and should not exist at all.

There are over one million year-round -- not including military -- residents on Oahu. Far from a small island community. However, I was just there and did some cursory googling beforehand to find quite a few buyers/sellers of bitcoin as well as some adoption at farmer's markets. I have family on the Big Island and they said that bitcoin is being talked about at the farmer's markets there. I think if we're looking at small network adoption the farmer's market is the place to experiment.

Doesn't really make sense for them to do this without a stable version. I agree though this would be best since looking over the code now there's a lot that needs to be set up for it to run. Tons of dependencies. Perfect use case for Live CD like Tails.

Precisely. Bounties are what the rich put on the heads of their problems.

It's end-to-end encryption so it really doesn't matter who provides the service. It's encrypted on the phone before being sent and decrypted on the other end when it arrives. Facebook also provides a [Tor hidden service]( so while they may not be the pillar of privacy (information on people is their business after all), they do give you the option to protect yourself if you want to remain anonymous.
Now before the inevitable comments about how we can't trust the binaries from WhatsApp unless their code is open source and builds are verifiable: yes, I'm fully aware of that. I am also fully aware that the baseband radio is a proprietary blob and that there really isn't any way to protect yourself from those kinds of attacks. This does protect from a vast number of casual attackers though.
The important thing is that this is a step in the right direction where encryption is pervasive and not an opt-in alternative for those deemed paranoid. Plaintext shouldn't be an option. The Internet remains broken as long as it is.

You can use vagrant on Windows to run it. Follow the vagrant instructions in the setup wiki. If you take the git clone step and do it inside the VM you don't even need to install git.

It creates a new HD wallet when you update. Swipe left to accounts and you can see your old wallet, transfer funds form it, etc.

A fellow bitcoin aware Chicoan! Ahoy there!

Another huge problem is that it's increasingly harder to run a full exit node. I ran several VPSes with them for a time, but one after the other their ToS changed and the providers shut them down. Also, there is OnionTip if you want to donate to full node operators.

Always run on a non-standard port just to avoid this kind of log spam.
