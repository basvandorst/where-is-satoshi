@_date: 2016-08-25 01:49:01
They are not using the Bitcoin blockchain.  They are using their own code, privately on a private network between banks.  It validates the usefulness of blockchain ledgers being shared, but it doesn't help Bitcoin at all.
Smaller/other companies that eliminate the traditional bank and that do use Bitcoin blockchain to move money over the Internet are the ones that will help Bitcoin become more valuable.

First to be safe, send your BTC to a new wallet.  Then:
1) Export your private key either in words or itself.
2) BCH - I'd say use a version of electrum they have to restore that key, make sure on BCH network, and you'll see your balance on old wallet.
3) Gold - I think coinify has been popular online to restore key to and send/use.

Basically yes.  It is zero fee for the user and just small transaction fee for Amazon.  It is immediate though on both ends since CB does the swap.  
Never the less, it is a start.
Doing true bitcoin transactions would require a wait for confirms (or network notification) and then Amazon would have to support refunds and customer service.  Coinbase removes all that.

Agree, if used securely it is an excellent store of value.  It is also only a great store of value if it can have assurance that it'll store your "value" (as compared in another Fiat for now) at a stable rate of at least 1:1 or greater.  That is what we don't have now with all the "it's a bubble" statements an volatility.

You just hold for st least a year then depending on sell you pay 15 or 20 percent capital gains.

Pay additional 3.8% Medicare Obamacare NIT tax on gains.

This dropped seemed purely to be the Europe 10K version of what we went through in the US a few days ago or so.  Hit 10K and there were a lot of sells/exits, trigged automatic stop sells on top of that, etc.
As the Euro/BTC market recovers over 10K, US will maintain its position well over 11K, and then new highs should be observed.  10K in different currencies tended to be the big psychological barrier or goal for holders.

I don't know of any other coin yet that could scale to BTC's network size and transaction load and do that great either.  BCH is about 2-3x  but 1) they are storing that all on the chain which will in the long-term make it too large to host/maintain, and 2) no coin, even BCH/others can handle real transaction volumes in the 20,000+ per second range that is needed for a true currency use.  There are a few new lean block chains on the horizon like Universa or so but those are still in development at best.

Yeah, I will say taxes suck.  In our case it will be:

THEN ALSO
Payment of AMT in larger cases...

Is this out of the idea to keep supplier even lower and avoid incoming supply, thus provide price stability?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:02:42
Nice.  I can see this as true since Coinbase poses no risk to Amazon, settlers to fist immediately, and surely they negotiated very low cost % transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:41:02
Best viewpoint I've read is:
Sell walls create an impression of a strong supply. This makes some people, unwilling to wait for the wall to break down, pitch their sales offers below the wall. By moving the wall closer to the current bid again, a large investor might be able to move the market to a small extent and then buy at a lower price. The investor's goal is to move the market, not to actually sell his supply at that price, so when the price gets too close, such walls often disappear or move to a higher price. Especially, if you see the same amount popping up at different prices, there is probably someone trying to move the market without actually fulfilling orders or bids.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:01:58
All the risk is on the seller providing the service/product.  Had many times over years have been glad to have dispute capability on a credit card due to large companies messing up, not delivering something, fraud, etc.  That will be challenging to replicate or someone can find a market to provide that "insurance" as a payment middleman.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:07:42

Great day hitting 14K.

Why even concerned?  Things are just around where there were a day or two ago...
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:03:43
Also, realize that:
1. if a large amount, you'll pay NIT.  That is another 3.8% medicare "Obamacare" tax on investment gains.
2. If a lot also, you'll probably have to pay AMT.  Thus taxes without any of your deductions anymore, can be a lot also.
3. States typically you pay income tax either if long or short term, sucks.
4. Also if a large sell, it will drive your income bracket up, thus you'll pay 20% long-term gains.
Worst case on long-term (&gt;1 year holding) is 20% + 3.8% + 9+% (say if somewhere like CA), + AMT taxes. 
Horrid.  Plan on long-term sells to loose like 40% if you have a big sell.

This "dip" is completely normal, 5th one similar during this year alone, and smaller than many over the years.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:09:24
Basically now at a minimum of 5 BTC per contract, institutions can create a contract to buy/sell Bitcoin at a later date, say 90 days later for example.  They are "gambling" on it being higher or lower (shorting).  The contract settles daily in cash, thus if the price of Bitcoin (by ticks of $5) goes up or down, then the contract is adjusted.  At the end date it is fully settled in cash as well with one party paying and one receiving value.
This will hopefully add stability, may slow down the growth of Bitcoin for next year, and worst case it allows a massive shorting of Bitcoin (although wouldn't recommend that in near-term couple years) which could create a correction if shorts grow to a large %.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:37:48

I agree as well.  I was torn a few times over the years on thinking larger blocks, but that isn't thinking long-term or even short/mid-term at this point.  The IT/Developer in me knows that you can't just increase bandwidth to solve all your problems, it is temporary at best.  Instead, a true solution has to be found - optimizing with segwit was a good idea, closing the loopholes in security with segwit, and then utilizing good software off chain for the global transactional goals.  There is no way that any blockchain as they are currently could support global transactions at scale.  Look at ETH and silly cryptokitties for example - that single cat "game" totally bogged down the network.  I have seen a few new ones being designed for 2018 like Universa that will be super lean with 20k+ second capabilities.  Storage of any blockchain like BCH/other is an issue.  Even with 10 minute interval blocks, to propagate globally 100s megabytes and then perform validation processing on that before the next block wouldn't be possible.  
Agree, thanks to the community and Bitcoin Core developers , aka true most viable Bitcoin for the long-term.

There is also a 20% bracket when gains knock your income into the higher bracket.  You then also have to pay your state taxes (if in USA with a state that has them) on gains of X%.  You then have to pay the Obamacare (medicare) 3.8% tax on those gains.  If your income is then in the higher bracket you then have to AMT as you lose all deductions mainly, etc.  Bit crazy if you sell a lot of BTC in one year.  Ends up being closer to 40% or so...

Things are cyclical in nature so I do expect a type of downturn again, perhaps much worse than the last one or unseen before.  The best a person/family can do is to make yourself immune to it as much as possible.  Have enough saved to not rely on a job's income for a while, not rely on debt/loans at all, etc.  Know that can be hard for most but is the best prep.

@_date: 2017-12-13 05:43:42
Depends on your income and how much you sell.  20% is the top capital gains bracket, not 15%.  If you sell a LOT of bitcoin it'll pump your income into the top bracket, thus 20% on long-term gains.  You do have to pay a state you live in income tax on those gains still as well.  Large amounts will have to pay medicare tax as stated (3.8%) as well.

Have an app that is submitting to Apple on 4/30/2014 and should approve pretty fast.  It will allow a merchant/person to use two devices to easily accept BTC.  1 device lets owner scan in target wallet address, allows for entry of amounts in BTC or USD, and the other will simply display the QR code when merchant sends it - all via Bluetooth/local connection.

$3 billion in control for a hedge fund isn't that much in the scheme of hedge funds, and they would never put it all in one place.  They would also use algo's as mentioned to greatly time and break up the buys/sells so as to not raise the price as much as possible.

**Reads positive more than negative but interesting mention of COIN to watch for in 2015.  Here are the excerpts to save time around BTC:**
No one can predict where the financial markets are going. But there's one very safe 2015 prediction to make about the financial services industry itself: It will keep churning out new exchange-traded funds.
One hundred ninety-nine new ETFs launched in 2014, a 30 percent jump over 2013. That expanded the total ETF universe to 1,666. And there are 1,111 new ETFs in registration, awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Among them are ETFs that would be the first ever to track activist investors, short-squeezed stocks and Saudi Arabia.
**Here’s a look at the some of the biggest launches to look out for in 2015.**
**A Bit Longer for COIN**
The most famous ETF filing of them all is the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust (ticker-to-be: COIN). Any time a word is changed in the filing, it gets national media attention. COIN would purchase and store bitcoins in the same way that the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) purchases and stores gold. The only difference is that the vault would be virtual. There is still doubt, however, that the SEC will approve the first-ever virtual asset ETF. The longer it sits in registration, the less likely it is to launch.

Not sure I/we follow your logic on buying all 14M outstanding BTC for 140K USD, AT $.01.  BTC has a value of about $347 at time of this article so it would cost about $5B to do so (but actually isn't ever possible anyway).

His view, is fine.  I'd also say that the core of Bitcoin is both:
- A store of value
- A transactional network
Now you can choose to view it as a payment system if you want like he does, but that store of value also has to be there before or concurrently for it to be supported as a payment system.

3 days usual just because that is the nature of our batch based banking systems, not including a weekend as well.  Basically one day to initiate wire, overnight to process and send wire between banks, then one more day for receiving bank's system to process in their batch...
@_date: 2014-11-15 00:31:35
Agree.  Ethereum has done some pretty great work at its customized tools &amp; language support.  There are probably benefits of running contract related code off of the Bitcoin blockchain - perhaps faster confirmations, more scalability, etc.  I have crazy pro support for BTC; however, I think it would be naive to expect all the great ideas we are seeing to depend on a single blockchain...
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:38:57
315.78 on BTC-e so even lower.  Not a huge concern though as volume at those numbers is pretty minimal - just weekend traders easily moving the market.  High volume days are what matter...
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:00:19
I'm definitely a supporter of Bitcoin but not as much as a currency versus more of a store of value/investment option at this point and a way to move large money amounts around with little friction.
If I take an unbiased view on convenience and use as a currency, I'd prefer to use a CC still or newer easy payment method like upcoming Apple Pay types or contactless/NFC credit cards.  From a mass market view, you just pull out the card or device, tap it, and done.  No loading accounts, buy/converting risks your local fiat, accepted everywhere, etc.  BTC is getting more convenient but won't be nearly that convenient for a while it seems.
The growth (thus price increase) will come from the investment crowd again and that takes time; compliance approvals, full regulation, ability to track in buy/sell side tools, and integration into order/execution management systems - none exist just yet.  Hedge funds LOVE new ways to invest though so it is coming. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 14:37:03

Sheesh, amounts are almost nothing in scheme of things - no biggie.  Loved all the anti-US rhetoric in those comments.  Even though upside down, the US keeps those countries afloat right now in the world economy.
As a person that goes to China quite a bit, I think we'll see the downfall of China before the USA.  That place has created a ridiculous bubble internally &amp; irresponsibly, is killing its people in the process, and doesn't have as much to show for it rather than some shiny new cities that won't last and are 1/2 empty...

Bit risk right now at this level.  The 25% likelyhood of an ETF approval makes it tempting, but its not likely to happen.  If doesn't - we'll see likely a $100-200 drop fast.
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:55:40
yeah it is odd because now they sell/have sold, and are stuck with the coins sitting on the exchange.  the either have to put the up for sell again, or cash out for RMB - which may strain the exchanges even I wonder.
Either way the coins are still stuck there in China I guess unless the exchanges actually then sell them outside of China...  not sure if that is allowed either though, maybe so as a business.
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:46:35
At that point when less coins are rewarded, price should be hire due to deflation and fees will be worth more $ for verifying transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:27:24
I'd say it is a little bullish.  I mean why approve a prospectus if the rule change to list isn't even going to be approved?
I see it as positive.  These people don't want to waste their time.
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:35:19
The shares of the ETF you buy will cost significantly less for each one; 1/10th I believe like GBTC.  They should mirror the actual BTC market for the most part but likely go at a premium due to investor demand liquidity for a while - as the ETF has to grow/secure more actual assets (Bitcoins) if so - otherwise as BTC price goes up, so should the ETF.

It won't come on 11th since that is a Saturday.  If it goes to the final day, it'll be on the 10th likely since Friday/last business day before deadline.
They could announce before which would likely be a more positive result, but they tend to take response up to final day.
@_date: 2017-02-19 23:54:43
It is the deadline for the SEC to approve the rule change.  It'll likely occur on the 10th (Friday) in USA time versus 11th as that falls on a weekend past deadline.
It won't immediately list I think, instead will proceed for finishing setup and list shortly after, x days/weeks from approval.

Likely at that point Chinese exchanges will return to parity and/or a premium over US based exchanges again.  If not it is an opportunity; however, getting your $$$ as CNY into OKCoin may be very difficult.  You would have to wire at a fee if anything, you can't really have a Chinese bank account, etc.

I wish China exchanges would clean up their act fast but it is good to see they are less of a true impact now.  If that government wants to try to stifle innovation they can try but it'll be another area where there are workarounds and they miss out on benefits in time as we bring Bitcoin ETFs/other financial products to market in the USA and elsewhere...

lots of cash flowing in to BTC as an investment/store is inevitable at this point - writing is on the wall, and ETF is being staged to approve and start soon IMHO.

@_date: 2014-10-05 01:23:42
Depends, the IRS doesn't let it work TOO much in your favor.
If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, the excess can be deducted on your tax return and used to reduce other income, such as wages, up to an annual limit of $3,000, or $1,500 if you are married filing separately.
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:25:42
Agree that Bitcoin can do some good for individuals around storing and moving money, but it won't in the near term impact the financial sector too much or change any governments/federal states.
I'd say a reason to hold is believing that it'll improve the above but BTC is by no means a radical freedom tool.
@_date: 2014-11-05 15:12:28
Decent amounts of BTC for sell here in Chicago USA area.  But it is all the same price at 5% above BitStamp prices.
I wonder if selling BTC is a bit risky at times as your providing a financial instrument to someone without going through AML type processes - depends on how much I guess.
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:52:04
Don't get too excited yet on a small pop - the downward trend was huge and its reversing again here in the AM.  But, agree - hope we see it reverse steadily on price and the good news, new products, and services keep flowing in 2015.
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:43:19
Assume like a major bank/cc does.  Charge-offs, fraud, disputes, are all loses and tax deductible somewhat as a loss on their balance sheet - not completely bad but they will want to strengthen their fraud prevention/detection as much as possible to try to determine where/who it may occur with.  Credit checks would be best...
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:44:07
True, the $USD is only getting stronger in relation to other fiat inflated currencies - which are all just un-backed notes at this point for economies that will not be able to recovery from their level of debt that has built up (especially the $USD).  Collapse is coming sometime...
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:17:56
That old independence against any state and the financial system ideal of Bitcoin is going away and will be gone in time.  It's being integrated into the system in the future, and if mainstream in time, will be regulated, work in parallel to current banking networks, be connected to them, and compliment them - they see its an excellent opportunity now more and more.
What hopefully won't go away is the low cost transfer ability, near instant ability, and the improving store of value that BTC will hopefully be outside of any country's fiat.  
We'll see in time...  2015 will be interesting, just like 2014 was.
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:56:40
Yeah, they could take the approach of not coming out and saying anything, thus letting rule change proceed by default.  But, I expect they will rule since this ETF has high publicity/interest.  Likely on March 10th I'd expect.
If they deny the rule change, then the other two ETFs (SolidX, etc.) will have to adjust to try to mitigate the reasons the COIN ETF was shut down.
I honestly think it has a good chance - but the SEC will want to cover their butts somewhat.  It is actually far less "dangerous" to the public than so many of the synthetics and derivatives already out there!
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:12:57
Great, but don't get too excited.  Facebook isn't THAT huge, is being used less by the trend-setters, and only about 1% of my connections I'd say even still know what BTC is - and 1% of them have some ;-)

NOONE knows.  You go back and read old post, people, Coindesk, etc, posting charts and stating where resistance/support is, charting diagrams of lows/highs, and then the opposite happens two days later.  BTC has an unpredictable price.
The only thing certain is that most people are excited and see the blockchain technology and network growing in the future.  You could derive then that price/value would go up to support that in due time - but when, nobody knows ;-)
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:03:21
I'd say practice what you preach.  Everyone always talks years, and hold, and don't worry, give it year.  Then the price drops for a few weeks/months and everyone talks days, the end, etc.  Good grief, give it a year, two, or more...
@_date: 2016-01-10 17:02:37
Nothing for a long while.  We accumulate way more debt in a day than the entire market cap of BTC for now.

@_date: 2015-01-04 00:16:33
Picked up a little more myself here around $275 - seems like will be a bargain when look back a year from now.  Too much going on to push BTC forward, especially after some positive ETF stories on Bloomberg as the one to watch (out of 2 mentioned), a relatively strong distributed network now it seems that won't go away, and so many people dedicated to its success.

I'd say there is a delay in new -&gt; price via the exchanges as it takes time to get more cash/capital into the exchanges via the antiquated deposit multi-day transfer wire system at times right?  Perhaps positive news today reflects in 1-3 days actual price increases...

@_date: 2017-02-09 15:18:13
Yeah, they can sell BTC and widthdrawl yuan - a good way for the government to force conversion back into RMB - smart move on their part to divert people out of Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:26:09
I'd do a transfer/transaction so that you keep the cold storage wallet offline and so your not using a key/seed that was EVER online - that is the entire point of getting one.
Just pay a good fee, $1 even so you get confirmed ASAP.  It isn't much to bump up to top priority.
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:35:18
It is kinda cool.  Technically though it is BTC being sent, not $2.5M USD.  The movement from one wallet to another still doesn't mean its completely possible to exchange the BTC back to USD at that full value, all at once.  
But, sending $2.5M worth of BTC for .04 is pretty amazing still.
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:00:15
I'd like to think it'll be approved today even more.
If the SEC allowed a rather stupid company, SNAP, to list based on a single app with photos and overlays then COIN (on Bats) has a lot more behind it.  SNAP has lost all its gains since IPO and is down another 10%+ in just days.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:12:28
I'd speculate that there is a lot of buying for a reason, but we aren't seeing any particular news.  Sure, some global events, but I'd guess this is insider/pre activity before some ETF(s) officially launch which when public will drive price up - so as usual Wall Street gets in unofficially before to make their sure gains.
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:47:32
They are almost always approved together!
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:18:21
i agree somewhat.  keeping eye on approval to possibly pick up few more coins, or more.  it'll be popping right then but will continue to have an upside for quite a while...
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:26:54
nice job
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:36:57
First, it'll be March 10th at latest on a Friday.  They won't announce on 11th/Saturday.  Likely before both even.
I don't think there will be a price crash, but instead a run up starting soon.  Likely prior to weekend or on weekend when many will have to wait for banks Monday to move money allowing others to snag coins.
Finally, the approval yes/no will leak, always does so you'll see either a run up or down (likely up) before the ETF approval even more.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:41:17
Rare I upvote but got mine...
@_date: 2016-01-12 23:23:30
Yeah, I say keep original Bitcoin, original Bitcoin.  Changes should be either on a 1) sidechain/integration method, or 2) a totally new alternative currency, not requiring any core changes to Bitcoin "core".  Bitcoin is a fine store of value right now and will remain superior to many others for time to come.  If not then people can store their value in alternatives and slow their use of BTC if they want or remove their value stored in it by selling.  
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:31:56
Well, it is an opportunity to buy a little bit cheaper before a potential positive ETF rule change approval - little hesitant though still.

Those goals are common for all users of Core or BU.  I don't think  would occur with BU as it would undermine both coins and destroy trust for a long-time or permanently.
The OP listed reasons for hostility - as a user I find them all to be valid, summing them up as BU has a lack of planning, lack of consensus from actual users, and definite lack of testing.  It flat out doesn't seem to be operating in the best interest of the network or by cleaning up and optimizing before just adding on capacity.  In business you optimize before just falling into a solution of adding space as technical debt will come back and bite you in the long-run. 
My view from the outside now is that BU is hostile, it is driven mainly by users that want to take over control somewhat and make $ doing it, and BU seems highly irresponsible.
I personally hope everyone possible fights and avoids such a ridiculous takeover attempt.

Shift card?  Seems like the one to use as you put BTC in a corresponding Coinbase wallet and can enjoy the rise in value (or loss).  Have that one here and have used well.
Others have you transfer value and then it is what it is in USD at that point.  Good if BTC is dropping, but not if it is going up in value.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:42:21
Not much though on future possible news, nothing else negative can really happen at this point that is truly new.
The hard fork this time is a different story - closest and most publicized the threat has ever been.  And there is a likely chance it could occur.  This would indicate that buying on the dip would still be bad as no one knows what the value(s) would quite drop to yet, how long it would take to recover, or if recovery would ever fully occur for sure.  There is a first for everything - very different then the 2012/2013 HF.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:07:28

Nice, finally.
I'm thinking it'll cause a downward dip/pressure at first for those feeling more comfortable transferring to an exchange for a sell, then cashing out.
In long-term it should provide for a positive demand to return, and one that is more controlled and "legal" somewhat this time.

I think we have a ways to go still as well.  Just a rolling curve here up a bit then down further, then wash and repeat...  
Love me some BTC, but be realistic here - speculative value is being destroyed by something that may go bust or 1/2 its value may divvy up in a fork (even if it is a ways off)
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:08:55
I see SegWit as a smart optimization, thus scaling solution.
I don't see pure block size increases as a solution, especially long-term.  If adoption grows then off chain makes sense with BTC as a settlement layer.  Peer to peer networks don't lend well to millions of transactions per second and never will.
In any situation where more bandwidth is added, more space, even physical versus logical - it gets used up, we find a way to use it.  
Pure block size increases, especially to a larger less manageable size will IMHO hurt the overall network and is a temporary solution.  SegWit makes sense to do ASAP.

It is only instant if you use a credit card, which carries the higher fee.  They still make you wait until it clears if ACH - usually ~5 days.

Agree, most people tend to just keep holding.  But we have to remember that a ton of people are just trading Bitcoin, especially in China - there is a ton of self automated and speculative trading.  It is a good way to Buy and Sell and keep taking profits.
Even if you assume/want Bitcoin to keep going up, there are always going to be downward dips.  So if you catch one, in an automated form you can buy in at that point, and automatically sell past a certain new high you deem if seeing another drop of X% - easy way to keep making funds (but not be invested long in BTC).
@_date: 2016-06-08 13:05:57
Tough answer really.  The GBP will likely take a huge hit of you guys do exit the EU; however, Bitcoin is notoriously hard to predict.  If you truly then that BTC will hold its value at least over the next year then it would be a good store of value to move into, but there is a lot of uncertain in BTC as well still.  In general though you may get more of a biased opinion on these boards because your asking tech savvy individuals that typically support Bitcoin (keep that in mind is all also).
There are other historically more stable stores of value like gold, but you may not reap any rewards like Bitcoin if it does increase a lot, gold may go up some more, or down a bit, but overall should stay stable - up likely as well in the case of a Brexit as its a more common store still.

Stuck at $700 still right now, but Huobi that sold off sharply with high volume is recovering.  Recovered about 1/3 of loss already and up to about $723 right now with an upward trend.  Could end up being a bit of a down day or break even 24 hour period in long-run.

I think more important than our $700 number is the Chinese value right now.

Yeah, most tend to agree that media publicized it more as a safe haven but there is not volume proof yet.  
But with that said, it will one take more days of instability for many to seek "shelter" or give up on other assets/stores of value, and it will also take several days in most cases to move funds into BTC through transfers, exchanges, services, etc.

Agree that it is legit outside China and in it as well with or without government say.  But it is important as Chinese determine right now how much your say $10 of BTC to buy something with is worth, they simply trade and control the vast majority of it right now.  Actions in China could make your $10 worth just $1 in a short period.

Great for good traders yes, but not good for long-term growth and adoption.  It'll keep people/entities from wanting to risk storing any value in Bitcoin I'd say, ultimately keeping it niche and down in price.

no, the passphrase (password) is just to decrypt the encrypted wallet.dat file so it can be used.  A seed, like BIP39 standard of 12 words would be needed to recreate a new private key - that is completely different (and not part of bitcoin qt back then).

Get a hardware wallet.  I used Bitcoin Core a long time but just moved over.  Really like KeepKey for a hardware wallet. Works great.
Your private keys are generated as well as a public address.  If anyone gets your private key they can use your coins.  You can also use your private key to recreate your wallet.  Thus you ca. Do this on a site like Coinbase. 
Best to control your private key, offline, and securely.

Not necessarily insiders, just a large Chinese population primarily that is really aware of the yuan value and what is being done to devalue or manipulate it.

This was due to loans to buy BTC, which selling triggered panic as Chinese buying on margin had to sell so they could pay back.  Payments are due today shortly as a deadline so a steep recovery of real non-margin buying could start here anytime with improved upward stability.

I hodl because I believe Bitcoin is an excellent store of value that I can control unlike cash with is an IOU depreciating in the bank.
I think Bitcoin will not necessarily every function as a currency directly, maybe as the backbones though behind sidechains will make that possible.  But I know from working in the Financial IT industry for 20 years that it is an excellent settlement solution, far superior than the batch/ACH/FIX options right now we use.
I'm hodling because I believe in time BTC as a settlement method will grow massive.  I also see it for sure becoming a new investment class.  Being here in Chicago at CME, the indexes and support to allow new ETFs to trade are there.  The COIN ETF will get approved this 1st half of year likely, and Bitcoin will take off.  With the increased use of it, the value of Bitcoin has to rise if you actually own it already.

In the USA, technically when you use it or sell it, it is a taxable event.  Thus you have to pay short or long-term capital gains tax on your next tax bill.

Yeah, I think Bitcoin would be even more successful at times if it wasn't always measured by 1 BTC = $USD, etc.  If we would have started or could move to a smaller level of units, like # satoshis = $USD, something closer to 1 to 1 or 10 to 1 then it wouldn't seem out of reach for many.  People don't naturally think in a way that they can just get any amount of BTC and to not worry about price...

If you look at the tax reporting report that Coinbase provides, they do treat a send of BTC as a sale, and purchase as purchase.  They actually ignore when you trade BTC to USD (actually sell through CB).
Seems off, but it actually works in most people's favor if these reports are accurate - but this does not align with IRS rules at this point so they don't seem correct.  Transferring BTC shouldn't be considered a sell activity per IRS, just when it is utilized to purchase or actually sold.

Coinbase' exchange is different than the direct selling you see in their site.  You could exchange 100+ BTC easily for USD at once or in a day, but it's the withdrawal limit of 10k per day that is upheld moving USD out of their system.
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:12:36
They still do less than all investment firms that are required to report to the IRS exact investment earnings, but they can't due to bitcoin moving outside of their platform.  They do have to comply with law though.
It is kind of good if they count a move out of Coinbase as a sell.  Thus if you buy and then move off CB you net $0 really in earnings they can report, leaving it to you still to reporting your earnings.  Even if you move coins into CB and sell through them, they don't report that as an actual sell as they don't know gains.

Your points are valid but you make the assumption that it was intended and only to be utilized as a currency.  That is actually great but also if it was used a ton as a currency, it couldn't handle the volume and speed of transactions required.  I don't think it'll ever be utilized like that without some off chain solutions.  It would need to support millions of transactions per second/minute.
It actually is being used well as a store of value, not necessarily as a speculative investment, but a true store of value.  People want to move currency into BTC away from their government/political issued currencies that are encountering a constant depreciation either due to more being issued or against other appreciating currencies (e.g. RMB vs USD).  This is a valid use and probably the more necessary and practical use of Bitcoin for now.  I think global use as a transactional currency would only occur either as a settlement level or smaller level once enough funds have been converted into it, think 1 trillion+.

With no replay protection, still not sure how you can be sure to safely spend on B2X and not impact your BTC.  Careful!  B2X seems to be omitting it for that reason, to be an attack and disable old chain versus split from it.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:39:34
Besides propogating those huge BCH blocks within 10 minutes, the nodes/miners have to validate them as well and processing a block that huge would take even more time.
BCH is not a long-term scaling solution.  In fact, it will doom itself in time if ever utilized too much and crawl to a stop.  They will have to hard fork to limit block size again and reverse back without something like LN.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:26:52
I've kinda assumed the opposite.  There is a planned hashrate for B2X &gt;51%, there is no replay protection as well.  With that, the old legacy BTC chain will fall behind and spend will occur on both chains.

This isn't really possible.  A country uses their own currency to help control their economy - inflation/deflation and exchange rates with other nations.  They wouldn't be able to do this with Bitcoin, it isn't any benefit to a country for use at all.
For countries that have failing currencies or economies that can not longer back the debt of their paper fiat then Bitcoin could one day offer a stable deflating currency for use - but transactionally it isn't ready for that yet.

1) We'll see more impact as other countries start to realize this can/will happen to them; e.g. Italy, Spain, &amp; Portugal seem next to enter troubled waters.
2) China makes up most of the BTC buying out there still, and their tanking investment opportunities are eliminating a lot of cash there period - but some might flow into BTC as an alternative more now.

@_date: 2017-04-20 16:23:56
True.  Bitfinex is having a mass sell by people to get coins out since they can't get cash out.  At a premium.  Their cold wallet is down to about 50% what is was just recently and is dropping to allow for this.
If enough move out eventually the exchange will "implode" and price will drop to what other exchanges are at, closer to 1100 or so, thus a $200 sudden drop i'd expect in minutes.

If the IRS gets their hand on Coinbase's data which they seem like the are (and will like most banks) then yes.  They'll know how much you bought and sold each year.  The thing is, they can't really know if it is the SAME BTC, thus you could have sold 10 BTC on Coinbase you just bought for more on another site - they can't assume just Coinbase FIFO.  I don't think they will ever get to the point of looking at transactions details and tracking wallets, unless automated one day - even then - price isn't really part of that.

Welcome to the group/forum/community, hehehe.
You could mine for fun is all, but you'll never really earn anything and destroy your laptop if you try likely.  
These days you need powerful rooms of equipment, very low/free electricity costs to make a profit - i.e. companies spending millions on facilities now.  The days of personal mining for Bitcoin have been long gone for a while now.
As far as exactly how the mathematical problem is solved, sure someone can chime in.  A way to look at it is somewhat that it's a lottery, with a better chance if more power churning away (aka more tickets).

This now contradicts the Federal government's IRS view of Bitcoin as property or being treated like equities almost.  A view needs to be finalized now, and:
For those that filed taxes due to larger sales of BTC or mining from previous years need to be corrected, perhaps additional refunds are due with corrections.
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:26:05
These $200-$400 dips now are only 3%-8% dips now, nothing too alarming in the big picture.  3% swings for any equity are normal at times and due to the high price of a single bitcoin they appear like a lot but really aren't.  
You can't expect to climb 3%-10% every single day without a few days here and there back down.  These are healthy as they keep establishing new solid basis.
Remember, every sell is actually someone buying in as well :-)
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:07:36
Cold storage doesn't matter.  The IRS has tracing relationship/software now.  Since where you sell doesn't likely provide a 1099 yet, it is your responsibility to report:
- the initial value of the equity/commodity they are treated as.  I.e. what you know you bought at.
- the sell value you receive when selling the above, FIFO is easiest to follow - but you have to track against every value for every coin or partial coin.

If your in the USA, you need to factor in short-term gains tax for now (your income level, like 30%+), or if you hold for one year you'll have long-term, say 18% roughly.

Miners are the ones paying for hardware to confirm transactions for all other community members (businesses and users).  Hash rate of the network is its security.

It seems like it is going to happen for sure, so at this point it just has to be dealt with.  It very well could be the first fork in reality that gets a majority of hash power.  The original BTC will stay BTC but 2X will be a more powerful network and could be more valuable.
I think it doesn't help to fight it at this point - instead accept it and prepare for how the two chains that support segwit (which is good) pan out.  
I personally don't think 2x is worth all this effort as another 1mb doesn't buy you much in the long run for capacity.

3. After all of this, waiting on finger to recognize, you usually still end up having to sign - or it defaults to debit when possible and you have to enter PIN, confirm, etc.
Overall, it takes longer and isn't reliable usually from my standpoint - and some places like CVS completely block wireless.
Honestly, here in Chicago/Boston I use the QR code service LevelUp quite often to pay for lunch and it works so quick and well.  Something like that for Bitcoin, even though QR, seems faster and more reliable.

AML laws require capture and reporting of your information so it can be check against known terrorist lists, countries/organizations that are prohibited, etc.  
It is odd though as Circle/Coinbase both collect that information and enforce the actual AML piece - so the transaction should be allowed.
Google may recognize it as once that occurs, that what you are buying FROM Circle, could be transmitted as BTC to a known terrorist, etc, and that tracking gets lost at that point.  Definitely a problem for companies and Bitcoin to figure out.
@_date: 2015-04-22 01:25:58
Yeah, I've had hit or miss experiences with circle.  First time it took forever and then had to deal with support at the merchant (was Overstock and still a pain).  Took 2 days to get someone to issue refund Mon-Fri only, etc.
2nd &amp; 3rd time it was near immediate.

Nice, just bought a new $118 iPod nano already cheap for just $88, with free shipping, and the $30 off  :-)
Easy checkout selection, and nice that they let you input an address for refunds if needed.  Quickly created one on Circle, then paid with mobile wallet and it almost instantly went through/showed paid after about 2 seconds.  Nice experience!

GDAX/Coinbase stated they will support both BTC AND B2X.
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:51:16
dunno. gut tells me that if the US SEC denies the ETF decision on August 10th, BTC will drop back down to low 6K or maybe 5K or so...  if they postpone a decision then likely some drop also.  But if approved, should get a good bump and run up over rest of year+.  Historically with ETFs they allow them, but historically with BTC they do not... but needs a first.  50/50% you could buy now and lose $$$ for a while and could have bought lower again.
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:25:58

Agree with everyone, its Apples to Oranges and BTC has much more reach and capability along with the fact that its not a centralized company.
But, if Venmo meets someone's needs and is that easy then by all means use it I'd say.  Lots of competition out there.  End users just see something accomplishing what they need  - and typically don't care about all the technology and protocol crap behind the scenes...

I'll add that the combination of Reddit and even foundation is really not that much of the true bitcoin "community."  It is the group that probably chats and post about BTC the most but makes a small portion at most of users/buyers/miners, etc.  Stuff on here doesn't impact the bigger picture that much if any...
@_date: 2016-10-22 18:43:25
The ruling from the IRS was to treat it like property, almost like an equity you buy/sell.
1. You would claim any earnings on it when you actually see them (from a sell) into $USD only.  
2. You would treat it like equities thus use short term (less than 1 year) or long term capital gains tax approach on those earnings only.
3. Technically if you transact with it to buy something, that counts as realization also (bit harder to track/deal with).
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:10:02
That's not a very responsible investment strategy to be 90%+ into a very high risk investment like BTC.  I have quite a bit too but its maybe 15% or so - bit more reasonable.

Yes, the Bitcoin blockchain itself is destined to be more like a payment settlement network; SWIFT, ACH, etc.  It'll never be able to grow as large as Visa/MC/Amex "neural" type networks.

The answer is decentralization.
@_date: 2016-10-30 22:30:54
I have Bitpay and Shift.  Like Shift better.
1. Bitpay has you xfer money in, and then its locked in at that value.  Thus, if BTC value goes up, your value on card does not go up (but it works well if goes down).  Physical card only.
2. Shift ties to your Coinbase account.  If you like CB it is a good card.  Thus if your CB wallet has $ in it, the card can be used for that amount.  If BTC value goes up, then value on card goes up (since it is really not on the card or stuck on card).  You can also add the card to ApplePay wallet or virtual wallets.

Buy what type of prepaid card with BTC?  Do you mean Visa/MasterCard?  Best bet there is signing up for something like the Bitpay one and loading it, but that is reusable and tied to you quite a bit directly.
"Prepaid card" is a broad term so expand on that.  If you meant physical BTC wallet where you load some Bitcoin, there are resources to make that yourself with a QR code, etc.
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:14:14

It is blatant, but how do you know for sure it is manipulation. Just appears to be some large sells at once to me.
Sure we'll get back up in time especially when all the positive news we keep reading finally goes live - all we hear are plans plans plans but nothing has yet to launch with all the Wall Street crap yet.  Soon.

@_date: 2016-10-05 12:59:54
Some think 1) price went up before the halving thus was priced in already for post halving profit levels on new blocks, and 2) there is an expected lag of 3-6+ months after others think before any new supply won't meet increased demands.  
Also use/adoption are increasing but perhaps not overall demand for new BTC fast enough still.  There have only been a few negative stories like Bitfinex hack etc since the halving and nothing truly good/new.  
I think the decision due on COIN ETF by 10/18 may create a bit of runup in price soon, but then either drop again or increase depending on if approved or not (likely extended yet again).
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:34:40
I can recommend the KeepKey wallet as well - nice hardware wallet overall.  Keep that and the 12 word recovery separately OFFLINE, stored away, is a good method for larger amounts.

All good now as finally did get in touch with the guy at Overstock that refunded my BTC.
The whole point of this thread was to show that the more technical buying process is still a bit undependable - e.g. the  order timed out and was not available to customer service before the payment arrived.  Circle is awesome but assume this could happen from any wallet service.  That and that the customer service agent that I did speak with had never heard of Bitcoin or didn't know much about how it worked.
I'm a huge BTC supporter but I don't live in fantasy land not admitting that it is much easier to buy online still with cards and that they offer a level of protection as a consumer BTC doesn't yet - sheesh!  ;-)

@_date: 2016-05-25 01:05:18
Good for you, your choice.  Seems a bit ridiculous though to get fully out as it is still a useful technology time to time.  We'll see where it goes.  Corporations do a lot of negative but also create just about everything you use.
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:34:37
and the time before, and before...
Never depend on coinbase to trade before/during/after quick price movements.  I'm almost certain they go down on purpose to protect themselves...  But, GDAX is up always, Gemini, etc.  Setup accounts at those dependable services instead.

Seen a lot of bull traps yes.  This actually seems to be optimism.
Segwit2x is signaling for real now on like 23 of last 25 blocks or so.  Segwit seems almost certain to activate the morning of July 21st now.  Price is going to keep going up and maybe shoot up past ATH around then...
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:19:05
Great meaning behind UASF but doing more waste FUD than good.  I have to say I think Segwit2X is the best proposal at this point and hopefully activates Segway in a few more days before UASF.
It is the miners that do the real work and incur the cost thus nodes don’t matter much for security.
@_date: 2015-03-17 11:55:52

@_date: 2015-03-15 22:12:44
If your in a place that Circle supports it seem like the best option lately.  They just updated their mobile apps yesterday as well - now you can add a bank account and have instant verification to immediately buy some BTC...  even just $5 for free...

@_date: 2017-07-17 00:46:07
Agree 110%.
We just see all the drama more and UASF vocal tech users more on these boards than most users.  You always see outlying viewpoints more than the majority in anything.
Segwit2X will activate here over the next few days, go smooth likely, and go smooth in a few months as well.  Bitcoin will likely pop up hard 8/1 or 8/2 forward...

@_date: 2017-07-30 16:36:07
Here in the USA, what they care about is really when you sell a "virtual currency" into $USD.  Thus when you trade your BCC to BTC likely, you don't have to claim taxes at that point.  When you sell your BTC for $USD though, you need to pay income tax on the earnings difference of the point when you acquired the BTC (from the trade) and the price when you sell.
Thus if you sell say 4 BCC worth $687.50, and BTC is worth $2750 you basically acquired 1 BTC at $2750.
Then, in the USA at least if you sell within a year at $4000 for example you owe capital gains at your income tax rate on the $1250 increased value you earned.  If you hold for over a year you pay long-term gains, which varies as a set amount but is current 18% rate for most people now.
And right, you have to track your FIFO Bitcoin buys/sells to account for it basically - a pain to do manually.
@_date: 2015-03-12 23:12:05
Yeah but it's a good thing.  Consolidation in high 290s for a while only solidifies that a move over 300 will stay easier or trend up further.  
Ten lots of selling at 298, but means those are buyers at 298 as well...

78.1 now.  It is inching up every block now.  1.9% more and it is golden...  should hit that in the next 140ish blocks.  Actually should cross 80% around about 60-70 more blocks, sometime on Thursday mid-day... (Central Time)
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:25:39
That sentence stuck out for me.  I saw it as a positive to be "nationless" and not tied to typically a huge body of debt - which pretty much all fiat is in most cases today.
This will be a positive that is apparent soon when economies start to go bust around the world...
@_date: 2016-05-22 02:53:40
This may help?
Seems like a ways off still.  Need 12.2 released, nodes/miners still then have to hit 95% adoption, then soft fork takes place only after that for a period of time...  Maybe in 2017?
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:42:08
Eth is depreciating constantly at a much higher rate that BTC - can't really compare the two.  Market capitalization is more appropriate for a company/organization, not a coin.

@_date: 2015-02-21 17:28:07
Nah, BTC will most likely skyrocket at this point sometime. Too many individuals/companies and financial industry members are looking to move into using it.
Theoretically, it could probably:
1. Go to $0 value if the Internet goes down permanently and/or we don't have electricity available one day.
2. Go very low if computing power progresses to where BTC encryption/keys are no longer a valid method for uniquely having a key.
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:14:08
It is a compromise of users and miners that put the most $ into maintaining the network.  A compromise, I see as finally a good thing after these few years of constant inaction.  Glad to see segwit activate in just a few days hopefully!  :-)

May take a while and some solid paper proof that the funds originated from legal sources, payrolls, times of purchases and transfers, etc.  
From now on don't leave funds in an exchange ever until your are ready to quickly exchange, then withdrawal.  Common sense.
@_date: 2016-07-04 12:30:05
It depends on really what you are looking for.  If higher limits or possible amounts with KYC/AML being done, then Coinbase or Circle is probably your best bet.  ACH is a system wide delay, you'll see that anywhere you transfer funds to/from using it.  Some smaller entities will be worse that CB.

The bitcoin network itself could never scale to be a transactional one like Visa's/MC's just due to it being distributed.  
Instead, Setwit provides capabilities that can make it more of a settlement network.  I.e. Lightning would be more transactional and other sidechains, etc.
@_date: 2016-07-09 03:03:19

Depending on your bank, if it doesn't process in the batch on June 30th and avail on Friday, then banks don't have to do another process until Sunday night for Monday, or in this case Monday for Tuesday since a USA holiday.

Honestly, I just use the stable ol' Bitcoin QT, but with a well complicated encrypted passcode.  But, I don't use that wallet to send any BTC so never have typed that passcode again yet - just for storage mainly.  It is also easy to backup that encrypted wallet file.  I suggest letting TimeCapsule create a backup, and then using another service to store offsite somewhere as well that you trust (zip cloud, iCloud, etc.), but I'd also additional zip that already encrypted file up with an secondary passcode so it just isn't out there.
For BTC I actually use, I just use a circle wallet on my iPhone since so easy/nice now.

I keep quite a bit in it, but always have enough fiat as well on the side too.  I also keep a number in my head where I'd at least get out at a loss if needed - but imagine I'd challenge that number if it came around to decide :-/ as also believe in BTC long term...

Seems like the reason, some pretty large chunks dumped all at once today - getting rid of the BTC that was stolen perhaps.  They stated $12MM USD worth so maybe half of 130K USD at most around 50K USD at the time.  Still, quite a bit to sell off still.
The promising thing is that the dumps immediately plummet the price, but there is consistently a slow and steady buy demand that recovers it so when all is dumped BTC should steadily head back up...
Every sell is a buy in ;-)
@_date: 2016-07-09 03:45:14
Must have been priced in we guess - if anything its declining overall since the recent overbought phase a few weeks ago...

The Bitpay one doesn't seem to have any fees besides the initial fee to get it, $5 or so I recall.  Been using it some for about 45 days now - works well.
Only fees in some scenarios around things like cash advances, foreign purchases, etc.  That's expected on any card though these days unless a large annual fee exist.

Does seem like they have to uphold the Federal view by IRS that Bitcoin is more of an asset.
The notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes.  General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.  Among other things, this means that:
Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.
Payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are taxable and self-employment tax rules generally apply.  Normally, payers must issue Form 1099.
The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.
A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property.

AGREE but likely seen as too risky for them for quite a while.

I think with time dwindling away and people just holding on hope that doesn't exist, both DAO is dead, and Ethereum is going to plummet to little/no value not too long from now.
Other smart contract initiatives will replace it and/or build on it in the future.  Ethereum failing is likely fine for others to succeed long-term...

All the Bitcoin debit/credit cards have pretty large international usage fees.  You are better off using a card that has no international fees (usually a fee card from major bank), or just using Euros/cash if needed.  If a place accepts BTC just pay with that directly - but will take some planning there.
@_date: 2016-07-09 15:09:20
Perhaps it may stay stable and is priced in.  Even with that though there are a ton of people trading Bitcoin and in it for profit, short-term profit, human nature leans towards this much more.
It could just as likely sell off quite a bit here soon down to its values a few months ago, say $300-$450 again USD.
Could very well have quick shoot up, and/or start to build/resume an upward demand and move on price too.  So unpredictable.  This makes sense with all the other fiat/economic crap going on!
@_date: 2016-07-22 03:17:49
Don't know of any yet.
@_date: 2016-07-20 03:11:02
Down 11%.  Makes some since due to news its in.  They all mention it in stories that say:
1. GBTC is trading around 60% hire than the actual asset it represents, thats a bit negative.
2. It is mentioned in the stories about other ETFs seeking approval soon, thus competition from more legitimate markets.
@_date: 2016-07-06 20:24:15
The whole Teukp reference and reading is ridiculous and invalidates these fools' entire report IMHO
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:12:30
Yeah this is odd lately.  Negative yield bonds are being purchased like crazy, gold, and silver - but not Bitcoin as everyone has been forecasting.  No boost from the failing equities/markets, Brexit, etc, or even the halving so far.
@_date: 2016-07-11 23:09:45
Makes sense.  The Yen and US Dollar, especially Yen is becoming way too "strong" from a political/trade standpoint so they are due to be devalued by governments soon.
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:36:53
I think staying above $600 is a good sign.
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:59:20
Nah, only headed up in the long-term.
Coinbase is simply becoming the AML/KYC good guy, like any major financial institution, doing things by the book legally and per US government.  This includes working with the government when needed and questioning transiations at times if they look like they head to illegal wallets/sites or hit thresholds of monitored and required reporting amounts (multiples adding up even).
Coinbase is actually helping Bitcoin in the long-run, them and other Wall street trading ETFs/services that are to get in on the action.  
@_date: 2016-07-08 23:49:20
Yeah, 4 vaults here.

Yawn, so a small % of nodes are going to fall off the network.  Won't be much to notice.  They'll be validating worthless blocks if anyone mines them - or if miners attack the 148 side by purposely mining blocks with 0 transactions in them to kill it off which is also a like occurrence in some cases to kill it off.  This BIP148 goes against all the principles of Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2016-07-02 05:36:12
WAY too late, just buy
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:30:28
Maybe this?
@_date: 2016-07-25 17:35:21
It's due for close of comments and some type of decision around August 23rd.  It'll likely go live IMHO not too long after that, in Q4 2016 I think.
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:33:48
Short term gains can be good at times. There is no guarantee that BTC will continue upwards, but there will always be dips on the way if it does...
EDIT: May have to call this a short-term selloff today since its erasing a full week's gains.

Man, sick of all the OneCoin is a scam post in the Bitcoin forum.  If hate it, ignore it.
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:56:05
Nice. We should see other exchanges follow and more comfortable behavior buying Bitcoin again now in China - volumes already look like they have started to pop.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:07:53
I dunno, a drop before this August 1st fiasco may change that.
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:48:48
I think UASF folks are just posting a lot, passionate maybe, but ignoring the principles of consensus that Bitcoin is based on.
I think 8/1 is going to roll around, some nodes are going to split off, and that'll be the end of the story.  They'll just be ignored overall and aren't needed anyway on the main chain.  Overall economic consensus won't be with them, maybe some miners will mine the 148 chain and allow 0 transactions to kill it off, etc.   
@_date: 2017-06-24 01:35:53
Makes no sense.  If you had sell orders then you had sell orders pending at your own direction.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:57:21
Down fast, but really just back where we were around May 26/27th which was still way up at that point.  Bitcoin jumped up above $2500 a little too fast so building that base in the 2300-2600 range isn't a bad thing again.
@_date: 2016-07-09 14:01:11
NEW supply is cut in half from 420,000 forward.  We'll also be at 16MM Bitcoins produced.  The next ~4 years (likely shorter again) will produce at around 4% inflation rate instead of current 8%.  Another 5,250,000 coins will be made over next 4 years.  Then everything cuts in half again, etc.
The next two halvings over next 8 years really start to reduce future supply I'd say...  when its only 6.25 coins per block, then 3.125...  Then we are getting into territory where they need to be worth quite a bit to fund mining and any conversion to other fiat currencies if needed still (likely yes).
@_date: 2016-05-19 16:02:38
Why are these stories even posted on here anymore?  For some reaction?
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:46:50
There will constantly be more highs and dips - even bigger potentially as the value of 1 BTC is more.
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:02:45
Nice, still a good time to invest I'd say.  Don't get stuck on the notion that you have to buy a whole 1 BTC coin at a time.  You can buy a little "piece" every so often and it adds up...
@_date: 2016-07-09 03:01:52
woo hoo!  fizzling out everyone's hopes and dreams thinking it was going to shoot up...  yawn.
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:53:13
Great post overall.  The BIP148 UASF split that occurs on August 1st, won't really impact Bitcoin.  It'll just be those nodes off on their own, failing to support the overall blockchain.
@_date: 2016-07-06 18:37:19
$2.4MM is created new per day right now and that will drop in half Saturday, so now is the time to do it.
Need to contact the big companies directly for this and/or exchanges to work out a good deal/break on rates.
Need to spread over several or more reputable large global exchanges, ones with high volume like in China, and time it out as well to get the best price without pushing the market up too much.  It shoots up/down easily right now.
@_date: 2016-07-09 13:55:12
Yeah, it's falling right here at lunchtime in USA.
@_date: 2016-07-24 18:00:40
Yeah, the Winklevoss COIN ETF is due for final comments and a decision around August 23rd.  Typically ETFs can list relatively quickly after that so Q4 2016.

Take these stories that get political with a grain of salt. Not sure how Trump fuels Bitcoin at all, even over Clinton.  Her tax plan is much more punishing to American's individually and corporations as well.  She also will just continue to fuel American debt and global instability.
