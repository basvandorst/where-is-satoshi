I want to use a secure software wallet. I've been using exodus and recently read somewhere that it's not truly my bitcoin as it is on their private keys (I may be wrong but am now worried). Suggestions?

Primarily windows but have access to IOS should it be more secure :)

Yeah sorry I need to get a bit more clued up. Thanks for the info though!

30 bitcoins is a lot though, proud of you. I'm slowly gathering, not to get rich but to be able to get into your position and support the growth

Is there a safe yet simple option to transfer wallet to another phone should you lose or break your current phone?

If I use a trezor or ledger can I still easily move my bitcoin around and use it or is that more of a store it and don't touch for a while wallet?

So what wallet do you recommend? I want a software wallet so I can move it but it isnt on an exchange

Say I want to look to get just 1 bitcoin. So i guess not a trezor/ledger do you have a particular wallet you can recommend?

I want to be able to move it around easily so not locked away and hard to access

I want to start buying bitcoin. What is the best or most secure offline wallet? Let me know why so I can take a look

I guess it's because I don't understand how to use them.. scared of buying
