The only "threat" Antpool is making here is that their blocks will be invalidated if they go against consensus. LOL. 
It's hilarious how empty of a gesture this is.

LOL Ver bribes people to his forums, to his mining pool, to his illegal casino, to his "development team" (biggest LOL of them all). 
"Depends on what your definition of 'is' is." LMAO.

WRONG 
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:52:23
Hahahahaha what an ignorant Nazi slithering snake in the grass. How stupid can you be to a) not know how hard forks actually work and b) try to publicly disrespect and belittle someone WHO DOES. lmao. this really blew up in your ugly face didn't it? 
Hey...hey Olivier. You might want to be the one doing the homework here, little schoolboy. Run off now to Hitler's School-For-Children-Who-Can't-Read-Well.

Cantpool has demonstrated they have no regards to decentralization nor the needs of the user. Antpool has missed out on 200+ BTC this month due to mining empty blocks. Jihan is merely attempting to control Bitcoin. UASF will put them in their place. You seem to not understand the timing of Antpool doing this. It displays in full view their fear of UASF. They know they do not have control over Bitcoin. And you're just a useless pawn in their power play. Unrewarded and ready to be discarded. LOL.

Well, we already know people  support attacking the "minority" chain (and therefore other peoples' property). They are fascist wanna-be dictators.

BU is controlled by the Peoples' Republic of China in order to stop privacy improvements to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:03:06
Bitcoin.com's coin vote page clearly states that if you don't have an investment in Bitcoin *then fuck you* your opinion doesn't matter. Blame Roger Ver. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:49:10
Roger Ver has a small penis so it is logical to conclude, in the Freudian sense, he wants bigger blocks because it's a subconscious insecurity (*"Enlarge your penis 8" with Extenze!"*). 
Bitcoin Unlimited = Bitcoin Extenze.

We can thank Antpool which mines empty blocks!

@_date: 2017-03-06 19:55:15
Bitcoin.com mined a &gt;1MB block. Mining &gt;1MB is out of consensus. No BU miner will mine a &gt;1MB so it is pointless to even run BU as your blocks will just be rejected! Derp! Jihan is scared! Squirming!
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:25:07
Jake, the Sneaky Snake Smith who smells like an armpit! Fancy seeing you around these here parts! I see you made a fool of yourself at Anarchopulco! LOL. Guess what, buddyboy? UASF down your throat! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

Jihan is a PRC operative attempting to use his mining capacity to control Bitcoin in order to stop privacy improvements to Bitcoin that Segregated Witness enables.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:50:58
r/btc. 
If you had a couple brain cells you would realize a PRC-backed coup attempt is MUCH more plausible than "BORGSTREMCORE" controlling Bitcoin. You fuddyduddy.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:28:43
"buy things to store the blockchain" doesn't really help your argument.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:38:34
Apparently YOU do. What a shit show of a user experience having to wait for 12 confirmations because of emergunt konsensis will be. That's some retarded thinking right there. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:13:27
It's already fixed by Luke-jr's spamfilter. All we'd need to do is get people to run it to stop morons like you with your (lol) "attack vector". 
Big blocks do nothing to keep people from "shuffling our coins back and forth forever ))&lt;&gt;((". And guess what? I'm going to shuffle MY coins forever on BTU's chain to demonstrate this. MORON.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:27:00
Gavin scared Satoshi away by going to the CIA. Satoshi knows best. Jihan is PRC. UASF ruins his evil plot. His timing is so obvious LOL.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:44:31
The bug created a 1.1MB block which is invalid by consensus rules. Since it was invalid, it was rejected by the network of peer-to-peer nodes. BU nodes which relayed that block were also banned by the P2P network. Misinformation my ass! 
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:57:03
"Is the anon for or against SegWit?" 
"They are anti-SegWit"
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:40:29
This confirms partially my theory that Unlimited supporters and SegWit opponents in China (or anywhere) are backed by the Chinese government. China wants to control Bitcoin development and steer it away from privacy improvements which destroy China's ability to monitor its citizens like the Great Firewall of China does, for example. 
China has the slave-driven workforce to manufacture en-masse ASIC miners to point to these shady new pools like CANOE pool, BTC.TOP, and of course more "reputable" pools like Antpool in order to force Unlimited down our throats and prevent financial privacy of China's citizens. 
With Vault 7's CIA information, a government-backed "anti-privacy developer coup" is entirely plausible. 
There is no such thing as a "private" company in China. 
Roger Ver is very hateful towards the United States of America and its citizens (he did willingly put American lives at risk by selling explosives in the mail). I wouldn't be surprised if he was funded by PBoC/PRC to push Unlimited. There is also an interesting amount of users in r/btc who do not write English in an articulate manner and almost in an "Engrish" way. Food for thought.
A hard fork, by definition, is not user-freedom friendly. A hard fork is de facto dictating to others what the rules should be. A soft fork is user-friendly, it's an opt-in choice, and it is pro-freedom. No communist government is going to support individual freedom.

It is being used ya doofus! WHY DO YOU THINK THE FEES ARE SO HIGH. IF BITCOIN WASNT BEING USED THE FEES WOULD BE LOWER.

Low Quality Shit Post.

It is significant. Antpool is apparently in the business of mining invalid blocks now! Lol.
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:13:38
Just use Vanity Pool. 
It uses split-key mining:

You expect users to configure their block acceptance depth and all the other BU bullshit when *most users can't even wrap their heads around satoshis-per-byte*?? LOL. Give me a fucking break man! 
BU tries to solve a user experience problem BY MAKING THE EXPERIENCE 1000 TIMES WORSE. LOL.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:08:06
This kind: 
How can you be so naive to think a government wouldn't do this to Bitcoin considering the CIA Vault7 revelations?
If anything, you would be stupid to *not* think they are attempting to do this.
