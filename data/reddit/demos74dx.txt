Overstocks stock is very low tight now but it's basically an annual dip because they always have a terrible 3rd quarter and make all their money in the 4th. It's not a bad time to invest.

Will do come monday.  Yes buy and sell.  It's literally scan your wallet QR code.  Select buy or sell button.  Put in cash if buying and verify amount.  Get a receipt with amount bought,price at time of buying, and your QR code so you can throw away your old reciept.  If selling put in amount, spits out money, gives reciept.

Trust in the dollar as currency is failing,  trust in a currency that was created to overcome the shortcomings of the dollar should rise.
