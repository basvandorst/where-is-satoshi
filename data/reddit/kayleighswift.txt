Ok. Clicking on the Venmo link, going to Sign Up... what's this?


Oh. Ok.
You know what IS available in my area? BITCOIN!

I've had problems with GMail. They just outright deleted my account without any warning or reason or anything. Just tried to log in one day and it was gone. 
I've bought my own domain name for email so if my email provider ever pulls any of that kind of crap I can just point the MX records elsewhere and not lose my address.

Since when did start getting overrun by 14 year old trolls? Run along home to mummy. Oh sorry, "mommy".

Why does that matter?


Again, why does that matter? The single largest is not the majority, and even if it were, it wouldn't matter.
Why do you think exists? It's here to allow *everybody* to discuss Bitcoin, to help educate people, to help Bitcoin take off and become something that is taken seriously. One of the main ideas of Bitcoin is that it's global, so why should *not* also be global?
Telling any Non-US redditors to "go away" and make their own community does nothing to achieve any of Bitcoin's objectives, and only serves to alienate users.
If that's your objective and you have nothing else to add to the conversation, I suggest *you* bog off and make your own site.

I had this last night, I called up tech support and they said they were having technical difficulties and to try again in a few hours.
Tried again at around 11:00 this morning and it went through, although I did have to try a couple of times. Just keep trying, you'll probably be able to make payment soon enough.

I've used Pingit through blockchain.info to buy about £25 of BTC and it's pretty straightforward and quick.
Also try  - you might find someone near you willing to sell BTC for cash.
@_date: 2012-11-30 20:20:04
That's pretty shitty. Mine's only not rooted cos it's a work phone, but I'll have to bear that in mind if I ever want to do any rooting in future...

I've only heard bad things about MtGox, and buying BTC through their Japanese bank looks expensive. Personally, I use Barclays Pingit through blockchain.info - very fast and not quite as expensive.
Otherwise there's also localbitcoins.com

Buying at the beginning of April, just before the drop.

Have you looked into running the Elliptic Curve algorithm on the Atmel chips yet? I had a look into it and it looks as though it could be a major bitch without having a good level of knowledge on maths/cryptography.
@_date: 2013-02-15 22:24:01
My first tip :) Thank you!
@_date: 2013-02-15 20:06:55
Exactly. I was thinking that having them in places like shopping centers, that are publicly accessible but already covered by CCTV/security staff/etc would make it a whole lot less likely that someone would attempt a smash-n-grab.
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:14:26
I have used both  and  I usually see what the price is on blockchain.info and then go to bitbargain to see if anyone is selling cheaper.

I have a motorbike and could cover the South Coast area if you want to expand your coverage.
Not sure about the safety aspect though, meeting random potentially shady people for cash transactions...
@_date: 2013-03-01 15:19:53
If you discovered a weakness, you'd just head straight over the richest accounts (which can be found easily with the blockchain) and not bother trying to resurrect lost keys.
And if this happened, either it would have to be fixed *very* quickly, or the value of Bitcoin would plummet.
Unlikely though.
@_date: 2013-02-15 18:47:25
I thought about that, but the reason for doing it this way is to save people having to type in an address. Also, without a keyboard (on-screen or otherwise), the machine can be smaller/cheaper.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:56:23
4 days since they said it had been transferred. I might be being a little impatient?

I was wondering this when I was trying to explain Bitcoin to my dad. "I'll just send him a quick e-mail with an explanation" I thought. I ended up with a wall of text explaining what Hashing is and how public key cryptography is used.

It would be more profitable to put computing power towards mining than it would to brute force private keys.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:05:04
Be careful with this - I transferred £200 last week and I'm still trying to trace it. It hasn't made it to my Bitstamp account yet, even though TW says the payment has been made. Waiting to hear back from Bitstamp support... all the while the price of BTC is rising fast...
@_date: 2013-02-15 20:51:50
I don't know about over there, but here in the UK I couldn't even get a note slot to accept a security ink stained £20 that wasn't even counterfeit, so they can't be that bad...

You're implying that 'clever' people don't use Windows. I don't think choice of operating system/development platform has anything to do with a person's intelligence.
This reeks of the "X operating system/programming language/browser/etc. is better than Y" arguments, which I absolutely hate.

Good question. The address space of Bitcoin is huge. And when I say huge I mean colossal. 2^160. That's 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976 addresses.
The chances of a collision occurring within any of our lifetimes are so close to zero that it's not even worth considering.
Here is some technical information on how they are generated if you're interested:

Especially if you're [this guy](

If they did that, they would be directly competing with the existing SatoshiDICE. Even with a large budget, it couls still take years to get to where SatoshiDICE are today, and they might not even get there. Buying out the business means they get an instant return, with very little competition.

No, you don't need the full BTC client at all.
The most secure way is to do it completely offline - download and verify a Live CD (perhaps Tails?), disconnect from the internet, boot from that, and generate &amp; print the paper wallets.
(You'll obviously need software to generate paper wallets - you can just download a copy of the web page that does it, just make absolutely sure that nothing nasty comes along with it when you put it onto your Live OS).
It's difficult to FU since bitcoin addresses have a checksum built in, but if you have a paper wallet with a QR Code, just scan the QR code and send the coins to that - it's less likely to go wrong that typing it in by hand.

Whoever owns the machine. I'm thinking of building one as a proof of concept and putting it in my local hackspace, should be able to get the parts for under £100.

Another gem from the original article:


@_date: 2013-02-15 15:43:46
Even more effective is to pre-generate the keys to as many words/phrases as possible, and then write a program to just sit and watch the blockchain for any transactions that involve any of your pre-generated addresses. If you get a hit, just insert a new transaction for the balance using the keys you already have.
I think a few people have already had this idea though, so it would be a case of whoever gets their transaction confirmed first.

I hate all this "Money can't buy happiness" stuff. I call BS.
Money is freedom. You work a 9 to 5 job, you think you're free, bullcrap. You're working for someone else, you are not free. You're not free to just get up and walk out of there when you want because you know that if you do you'll be in the shit. You're not free to just take a vacation as and when you like, to wherever you like. Unless you have the money to do so.
Even if you work for yourself, the concept is the same. You need money to survive, therefore you have to either work your ass off or get lucky somehow.
To be truly wealthy is to be free. I don't want to work another day in my life, I want to travel the world, and sample the best it has to offer.
Tell me how I can do that without money.

It's a problem in the UK too. BitBargain and LocalBitcoins are an absolute ripoff. The wire transfer option is a bit cheaper, but takes days - by which time the exchange rate has changed, which makes it a buttload harder to take advantage of market fluctuations.

I have never found a solicitor or other deed poll provider offering the service for free. Even if you go through HM Courts you have to pay a fee:

Yes, but it tacked my name onto the end of it...
@_date: 2013-02-15 18:45:38
Similar, but without having to type in an address. It creates an address itself and prints it along with the private key, ie. a paper wallet.

That's why it's called an "Investment"

One of the main problems I think is the attitude of the banks here. It just seems like the second they find out you have anything to do with Bitcoin, they close your account and refuse to do business with you.
@_date: 2013-01-09 21:22:09
The two ways I'd suggest to buy bitcoins are through blockchain.info (they do bank transfer and Barclays Pingit deposits which are really quick and easy) or localbitcoins.com to find someone near you.
