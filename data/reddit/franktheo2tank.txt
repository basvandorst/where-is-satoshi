This is a really stupid example of how a wire transaction should be used.  I can't believe you made this transaction just so that you could create a misleading story / picture for the internet, LOL!!!

Nothing special for this, it obeys the moving averages that can be shown on GDAX almost absolutely.  The support and resistance that I'm talking about, is just simply where it's found support and resistance before.  I wouldn't actually trade this shit in large enough amounts to be anything but fun.  Find a real market if you want to make real money...

Says every person who knows nothing about charts.  All they read is human emotion, and that's the same in every market.

Don't feel bad, they're gonna buy at 4K again real soon, before it really falls off the cliff, LOL!!!  This trash broke several clear support levels yesterday and the resistance at 4K will be monumental now that a Death Cross has formed there.

There is no such thing as 24:00, midnight is represented as 00:00 in the 24H time format.

The chart looks terrible, death cross has formed on the daily, and this thing is gonna hit at least $2,700.  No support left until then once it breaks through this $3,300 area.  Only a fool would hold this shit right now, you can buy back cheaper later, probably tomorrow at this rate...
The propaganda on this board reminds me of the stuff I used to see when I played the sub penny market, HOLD FOR THE GOLD, BRO!!!
PS the guys saying that kind of stuff, are dumping their coins left and right as you speak...
