There’s nothing illegal about cashing out. Just know that you’ll pay taxes on it. The rate at which you’ll pay will be determined base upon how long you held the asset for. I’m guessing it will be long term capital gains so there’s no need to wait to sell. Just find a qualified accountant early next year to find out how much you’ll owe in taxes.  It will likely be 15%.

If you bought $50 of bitcoin at a USD rate of $6300, then the rate went to $1,000,000, then that $50 would be worth just under $8,000

Honestly, I can't say I'm informed enough to provide an educated opinion. I just was curious as to which companies signed. 
That said, companies should have some sort of right to change their stance when presented with new information. They also should be able to make some concessions in order to move a technology forward.

Still seems dramatic for a sale of just 0.0052% of the current market cap.

Selling ~$2.5m of BTC can drop the price that dramatically? Damn
