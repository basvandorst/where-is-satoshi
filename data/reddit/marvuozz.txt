i gave you proof of "If BCash got to this size, it would have the same problems", in the form of an example.
And is not "people upgrading clients".  The problem is to upgrade every software running in exchange, payment processors, miners, mining pools, AND people and their wallet. And this upgrade would be mandatory, at the risk of losing funds due to following the wrong chain. You can't play like that with a 300 billion system.  Look at Segwit2x... It would have killed bitcoin if it really had 80% hashing power behind, since it was not able to mine the fork block due to a bug.


You don't see, but it's there. Do you remember satoshi dice and their on-chain gambling? or 1 satoshi spammers that spam links on blockchain.info ?  They stopped because of the fees, and if fees were to disappear what would happen?  So yes, all the available almost-free space will be occupied no matter what.

As to why no blocksize increase... It is a linear solution to an exponential problem. That means that you have forced the whole world to update every software that interacts with bitcoin... only to postpone the problem for a year ( if lucky).  
In reality, the fee are market based so if you alleviate the pressure and raise the blocksize, blocks are filled again almost immediately and fee reach a slightly lower equilibrium.

During the secret mining ghash's hashpower would disappear from main net, no found block would appear to be from ghash.io, and average block rate would halve. If some 3rd party miner on ghash pool notices this and changes pool, ghash loses his little advantage and his chain would fall behind the main chain.
That scenario would require the pool to have another 100 of the network hashpower working on the parallel chain.

It was a rude way to say that if OP knew at least the basic concept on which bitcoin is built, he wouldn't have proposed to "make p2pool mandatory".
It's like explaining procedures in open-heart surgery to a non-surgeon.  It's not that one is more or less intelligent than the other, it's because one have the underlying knowledge needed to understand the concept, and the other doesn't.
Noone even tries to propose a new open-heart surgery technique if is not a heart surgeon. 
But in the computer world, everyone knows better. And everyone has "solutions"! I'm in tech support and see it everyday.


The "useful post" would be an explanation of the bitcoin protocol, but there is already plenty of documentation avaliable, 
The best answer then is  "Please read more of bitcoin specifications and you'll understand yourserf why it is wrong".
I'll try to explain anyway:
P2pool works with a side-chain with a target difficulty adjusted for 1 block every 30 seconds.  So this proposal would be essentially lowering bitcoin block target time to 30 seconds, and block reward 1/20 of the current reward. With all the propagation-time problems that arise from this.
Even then, you can't prevent pools from working on p2pool.

P2pool works with miners mining a sidechain with 30 sec target block rate. Sometimes a block of this sidechain is also a valid bitcoin block, and then the block reward is splitted proportionally to how many 30sec blocks every miner found.
Mandatory p2pool would be the same of reducing bitcoin block time to 30 seconds and lowering block reward to 1/20.
You would not be able to block pools from mining inside a p2pool node. Not to count block propagation time issues.

Do you remember the DSL boom?  While noone had it, it was good.  Then the derivation boxes became full and it sucked.   then fiber came, scaling speed 1000x.
These things need tens of years to mature to mainstream products, it needs to reach the point where users don't even think about the underlying tech. Like with whatsapp today.   
Another example: video streaming.  Youtube was born in 2005, it took 10 years to become usable for everyone. 
If you find it slow and expensive, dont use it. Wait until it becomes cheap and fast and in the meanwhile use whatever cryptocoin you trust. Let the markets do their job by voting with your money.

A hard fork for a flimsy 2x scaling is ridiculous. There are tons of upgrades that will be merged with the 2x part when those are ready. And it should take months if not years of testing.

Bitcoin fees are not there for being user friendly, just like TCP sequence number are not there for the user. Are part of the protocol. 
Fees are there to prevent spam transactions without defining "spam", and to provide revenue for miners when the block subsidy ends.

It's way to soon for things like that.  
As of now, there is a [draft of the specifications]( and three implementations that are doing integrations tests.
Meanwhile the spec draft is updated.
Like with bitcoin itself, while you can test it in your test environment using "fake" coins, that really is not the same as real world tests with real value.   
Segwit activated a few days ago and this phase has just begun.
In the coming months the protocol should be finalized, and wallets will begin releasing implementations.  
This cannot be fucked up. The moment money is lost for a protocol problem ( not for user error ) the whole thing could collapse. So you'll agree that it needs its fair amount of testing.

So the answer is... break the community *again* with *another* contentious hard fork?  
A compromise is some middle ground, not doing as one part wants, and if the other wants to follow, good.  
The compromise is, and has always been hard forking when the new block header format is ready, with 64bit nonces and all. Too technical for the community to understand, and the argument is drowned under all the screaming for bigger blocks.
But no let's hard fork a gazzilion times, there is no risk....

Eda lowers the difficulty. You can mine a block with higher difficuity than required, not less.

It really depends on the timing. 
If  a 50% drop of the total hashrate happens just before or after a difficulty retarger, the next one will likely be 4 weeks away, with a 20 min block time average. After that, the situation come  back to normal.
If it happens in the middle of the two week retarget period, it will be a longer slowness period.
Like 20 min block time for two week,retarget, then 15 min for three weeks, another retarget and then back to normal again.
If the percentage is more than 50% the effects are magnified.
The 2/4 waiting week period can be used by someone else to set up mining operations, to take advantage of the difficulty drop, or by mining in places where it was previously not profitable because of energy prices.
It would definitely be a shock, but it would not be the end.

You will end up with a few different electrum wallet files, one for each format, but the addresses wil be the same of the ledger app, because they will derivate from the same seed and the same path as stored into the ledger. Transactions from a bech32 address are cheaper, so you will have to move your funds to it to enjoy the benefits. Just wait until mempool is almost empty to move funds, and set fees super low.

Ledger wallet uses a ledger server to broadcast the tx, so those server could have detected the recent spike in the mempool size and delayed the broadcasting.  I'm just guessing, because if the tx hit the mempool, it will eventually confirm. It could take weeks, but it will.   
Look for the destination address on a block explorer to see if the tx is still in the mempool.  Maybe ledger's servers dropped it but other nodes didn't.
Should the need arise,  spend the unconfirmed output with double the fee to cover for both, and miners will include both in a block. You might have to connect your ledger to electrum to do that.

Yes. Miners can spend the reward only if everyone agrees that his block was the first found. A tie is resolved on the following blocks. Every block has a reference to the previous, so the next block will have the previous"winner" block.
Miners are incentivized to follow consensus, otherwise they lose electricity and block reward.

A dropped transaction is not guaranteed to be dropped again after being rebroadcasted. It can be confirmed if it is valid, and it will eventually be.  
Also, there is no "mempool". Every node has his own mempool, that is cleared on restart.   
The scenario you are picturing is always happening, and obviously has not turned into a death spiral.  
The 14 days limit is *per node*, so a freshly rebooted node will rebroadcast the TX  for 14 days since it has first seen that TX.   
A final note. This is not consensus-critical, so should the need arise, it can be fixed without disruption or fork.

No, those values are "etched" in the blockchain from the very start. Any change to that rule makes the blockchain invalid. Difficulty was 1, it can't be lower, so blocks were found at intervals of more than 10 minutes.  Think that about 20 people max knew about bitcoin then. 


Actually, this is exactly what happened: he has a lot of addresses, he mined almost by himself for months, and got many many blocks. The legend says that he might have lost the keys.

Tie is solved next block. If not, the next. If not, the next.  Over time, tie is solved with 100% probability.
If someone does not agree with the consensus, he loses electricity and block reward.  
Everyone is mining on the "true" branch of the chain, while the lone miner keeps mining his. "True" branch has more miners, so grows faster. Everyone can see that "true" branch is longer.   The master rule of bitcoin is that the longest chain (the one with most proof of work), is the true one.
The lone miner's reward exists only on a dead branch, so he has no reward for his enegy expenditure.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:28:42
When building a block, a miner adds together all the transaction fees ad adds that number to the 12.5 reward. 
[This]( block, for example, has 12,5 btc reward and 2.36  btc of fees. Reward TX (it's called coinbase tx) is for 14.86.
This 12,5 will becone 6.25, 3.12  .... etc.. goin to 0.  By then reward will be 0 + fees, and no "new" coin will be created.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:20:18
1. Yes. A block is valid only if every tx inside is valid. If just one tx spends an amount that does not possess, the whole block os invalid, and the miner loses the reward.
2. Mostly yes. If a miner succeeds in catching up and surpassing everyone else workong together, his chain is the one that becomes valid. This is called 51% attack because it works only if a miner has majority of the bitcoin computing power and is goind faster than the rest of the network.
 You cannot have other means of deciding which is the true chain, otherwise there would be a central authority. Who would decide which hash is "strange"? And if a node is just started, how could distinguish the two chains? 
Note that a miner doing so can only revert transactions. He cannot spend coins he does not have.
Currently an attack of this kind would require at least a couple of Gigawatts of power, not to mention the mining hardware.

Not from time to time. That rule is continually enforced. If a client is lagging behind and receives a longer chain, it switches immediately to that one.  
 If he is a miner, for every second he follows the wrong chain, he loses money.  So much that the few second needed to propagate and validate a new block have a meaningful impact on earnings.

Should a miner get and sustain a 51% attack there is the "nuclear option": change the proof of work algorithm. This would damage the ecosystem, but it would render the attacker's hardware useless. There would be no shortage of people glad to participate again in mining with cpus or gpus.  
In 2011 it was non-malicious, and it was a mining pool. A 51% attack is detectable, because other miner's blocks are constantly rejected. Individual miners of the mining pool would leave if the pool begins attacking the network.

It is actually the first. It is called coinbase transaction.  The company coinbase took his name from that.
Miners are allowed to add a transaction that creates new coins. They do that every block. That is the reward for securing the network.

"Energy" by itself as a quantity does not mean anything.  
The energy you are referring to, is "energy that can be used to perform work". And that quantity is finite. 
Try moving your car using a giant balloon of hot exhaust gases. EDIT better yet, recollect the exhaust gases from the atmosphere by yourself.
By burning gasoline, while the total energy of the system is unchanged (and in this you are right), the entropy of the "car-atmosphere system" is very high, therefore you can't do work with that energy.  
Energy in the form of diluited heat is a form of energy with a very high entropy. Concentrated heat, a bit lower. 
Energy in the form of gasoline, or a charged battery, on the other hand, has a very low entropy and can be used for useful things.

You should really avoid using private keys printed on paper.   
You should instead generate a [BIP39 seed](  and write this on paper, in multiple copies, kept at different places.
This is much easier to read in case of damage, and you can copy it by hand.
You should also use a BIP39 passphrase, known only to you and a few trusted persons. This way even if someone manages to steal the seed phrase funds are safe.

With POW there is a DETERMINISTIC way to determine valid chain even if you only have chain copies offline. POW survives a total shutdown and restart of every node. Also in case of global network partition.  POS can't do that. Once the network is partitioned, it stays so.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:23:36
Because there is the need for a decentralized single source of "truth" (order of transactions) , and POW solves that (it's the byzantine generals problem). Otherwise you could spend the same coin in two places and you would have no way to make one of the transaction valid and the other invalid.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:38:57

Difficulty is recalculated every 2016 blocks and is based on the time it took to mine the previous 2016 blocks.
You look at the timestamps of those 2016 blocks and if it took more than two weeks to mine them, difficulty goes down, if it took less, difficulty goes up. This calculation is done precisely and independently by each node. The 2017th block will have to meet the difficulty requirement that result from this calculation, otherwise it is considered invalid by the other nodes.
Transaction number in a block is totally unrelated to the difficulty. A block is like a page in a book. You can leave it blank, write only one word or fill it. The page is there. The only thing that change is the disk space occupied, and the validation time.

The network just has to choose one. It doesnt matter which, as long as there is consensus. POW allows that. 
Once the network has expended a certain amount of energy, it would take an even bigger amount to change that decision, and the effect is cumulative over time. POW is thermodinamic guarantee of immutability, that every node can verify, even offline.
A stall where two equally valid blocks are produced is resolved in the next blocks.

If you remove non mining nodes, that is just a very expensive and inefficient write only database
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:52:31
No, the coins are issued by every miner to themselves on every chain. The coins have value only if they are accepted by every node.  
If miners decide to fork and mine a coin noone wants to trade, then miners would be burning electricity for nothing, and missing on the potential gain of mining the accepted chain.  
This works if mining is decentralized enough, and if there are enough independent full nodes (independent as in "not owned by the same entity, not in the same country, network, datacenter...". Number of nodes is irrelevant if they are all under one person's control).

If the two chains diverge with different hashpower, one of them will reach a difficulty readjustment before the other, and from that point on the total work done on each blockchain at the same block number will not be the same.  
Accumulated difficulty is the sum of the difficulty of all the blocks, so if the hashrate of the two chains is different, the chain with the most hashpower will have a higher accumulated difficulty at the same block number, compared to the chain with less hashrate.   
When you see "longest chain", this is what they really mean, otherwise you could just fork a blockchain, fake the timestamps so that difficulty goes down, mine a lot of blocks at low difficulty and claim your fork is the longest one.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:01:27
The POW is needed to make sure that the whole network works as one entity. It's the competitive tension that make the system resilient.
It's just what the word mean: proof of work.  Proof that a certain amount of energy has been expended.
If you want to alter the system, you are a single entity competing with the whole network, while if you play by the rules, you are competing with every other network actor individually.
A blockchain with no POW is just a database.

You do not get to decide when. You know only that in a month you get about one 6-streak.  
The network, in the meanwhile, is 35 % slower and suddenly some old unprofitable asic miner is profitable again and is turned on.

Private keys are strings like this one: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF   
 
Google on how to do that. if you received bitcoin only once you export just one private key. if you used it many times this method might be inefficient.  
Write those strings in a empty formatted usb drive, in a txt file.  
Start another freshly formatted and updated online pc, install Electrum wallet, create new wallet, write down the seed on paper (is a bunch of random words), choose a good password, sweep the private keys in your usb drive (google "sweep private key electrum").  SWEEP, not import.  When the transaction is confirmed, wipe that computer. That bunch of word now holds your bitcoins. Do not let anyone see it, do not lose it.  
When you want to spend, restore electrum wallet from seed on a fairly secure online computer.  
Now you can do your research on hardware wallets, knowing that your bitcoins are secured and readily accessible. When you are ready you can transfer the bitcoin on a hardware wallet.

But that's true for any fork and segwit is irrelevant in the outcome.  
Miners prefer economic majority, so hashrate should flow to the economic majority chain.  
But economics of cryptocurrencies works both way, and economic majority can flow to the chain with the most hashrate.  
Saying that you can predict the outcome of this feedback loop is like saying "i can predict the stock market".  
p.s. if you really can predict the stock market, and made a shitload of money,  remember of the internet stranger you had  a conversation with once!

Noone made such list public. It's a kind of moral gray area. Many people are monitoring those addresses, but if you want a list, you'll have to make it yourself. Data is right there, inside your full node.

How is this different than using the same heuristic on the other UTXOs, without dust?

With a Trezor you can do that.

There is some correlated extranonce values in the first blocks that allow to discriminate miners. One in particular was mining from the beginning, and spent only 10 bitcoins sending them to Hal Finney. That's satoshi's machine.

Thanks. I didn't realize that the talk was in english. I was late and heard german speaking...
@_date: 2018-12-27 20:06:26
Is there some written info? I dont' understand german :(

I have found no public list of such addresses, but the data is forever recorded in the blockchain.

Could you explain it? I always understood that these anyone-can-spend output are so because this way old clients do not fork away from the chain, since a segwit transaction is not really understood by older clients.
Obviously if someone accepts such non-segwit-transaction that spends a segwit output, he forks away from the chain, as soon as the segwit coin moves, and real valid segwit transactions spending those coins get mined.
The economic majority would be cut away without mining power.
