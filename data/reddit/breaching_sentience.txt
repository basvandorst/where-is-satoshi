What an idiot. Here is the retard version written specially for you:
If you put money in a bank the bank lends it out. Savings = investment.
If you put money under your mattress, it doesn't get spent. Hoarding != investment.

This is not technically true. When deflation happens the total amount of labour and capital that is spent on producing stuff falls, and total economic output (the size of the pie) falls as well. This is why small amounts of deflation are considered worse than small amounts of inflation.
Printing more money has a re-distributional effect. But under certain limited conditions it can also keep the economic pie from shrinking.

Respectfully, you make two major mistakes.
1. You seem to think that hoarding is the same as saving, but this is not the case. Hoarding is the act of holding an item out of economic circulation in the expectation that it will increase in value. It is different from saving because savings are assumed to circulate back into the economy as investment. Deflation is destructive because it encourages hoarding, not saving and investment.
2. You seem to think there is a zero-sum trade-off between current and future spending, but this is also not true. When GDP falls the amount of productive inputs *produced* by the economy fall as well. So a fall in GDP in any time period negatively affects potential output in future periods. Yes, you will absolutely get some *boost* when hoarded capital flows back into circulation, but outcome will be mostly inflation at that point, not a return of GDP to its former level.
