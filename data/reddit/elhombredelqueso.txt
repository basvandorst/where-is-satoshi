If you're a business and I want to pay you with a credit card, depending on how you take my payment you can store those details, exploit them, sell them, lose them, and if I don't notice quickly enough whenever it finally does get exploited (could be months later) I'll be liable. At best, the vendor you exploit or the ATM you cash withdraw from is out the value they traded you.
With bitcoin, you provide me your public key, I authorize the payment to that key, and although you can see a public address the payment came from, there's nothing you can possibly do, no matter how much you wanted, to authorize another payment from me, short of cracking a level of encryption that's massively difficult to do.

As with what happened with the internet, companies will come in and innovate ways for customers to be insulated from the scary and confusing underpinnings, abstracting it away and leaving only familiar and simple ways of doing business, albeit with a different protocol underlying everything.
One big difference is that power users will have much more control over their money as opposed to the banks and money transfer networks of the past, and the protocol will allow for an explosion of new innovation in how we move money.

As the community develops, few people should be keeping significant quantities of money in an online wallet where the operators have your private key. However, even if everyone kept only a fraction of their money in an exchange for active use, the thieves could process/steal a lot more money/value a lot faster than they could with credit cards. And with the stuff stolen on credit cards, that burden falls on the vendors rather than the CC owner or the CC provider, whereas the lost BTC are taken from the BTC owner.
On the other hand... can't exchanges store private keys in salted hashes?

How does one go about day trading in Bitcoin anyway?

That brings up a good point. If you are a Target customer, for whatever unfathomable reason Target decided to store your credit card number long enough for it to get stolen. If you send money to this bitcoin poker website, it is impossible for them to take more money from your account than you authorized. The hackers could only make off with your gambling funds.
The financial system currently makes up for the security vulnerability of every mom and pop website having access to your secure card details which can get stolen, by making you not liable for the charges, which translates into higher costs for vendors, and higher prices for everyone.
If you don't have to give those secure details to every person and website you do business with, then the only websites that have to be secure are ones that actually hold your funds, like your bitcoin bank (if you have one) and exchanges.

You would probably be making lots of these. Pre-printing lots of spare blanks, then you load them up with whatever denominations you want. A $50, two $20s, two $5s, and one $21.39 for shits and giggles. Whatever. Whenever your real wallet is running low on these "BTC bills" you go and load up some more with whatever denominations you're lacking.
What would be awesome is that conceivably you could password protect the encoding of the private key on these paper wallet-bills, so even if your real wallet is stolen, and even if the thief knew what bitcoin was, they still wouldn't have your money!

Hmm. Makes me wonder what sorts of risks exist and possible plans are in place for temporary disruptions to the internet... Like, we've seen nations experiencing internal disruption cut off the internet while trying to contain the problem before. Under those circumstances, the miners within the country would, naturally, start working on their own blockchain, although probably very slowly I suppose... I guess that alone would tell everyone that something's not right... But still, eventually they'll reconnect and all the miners will drop their provincial blockchain as the global blockchain will be longer, and so whatever money was spent since the internet was cut off will, essentially, be reverted.
I guess if you're a merchant you should accept your payments from a payment processor who keeps abreast of the global network health and could stop accepting transactions if they believe something's wrong.

It would certainly be inconvenient for intra-martian commerce. They would either need their own bitcoin network, or to settle for long transaction times between themselves.

A flaw that means we cannot salvage the ledger. Every wallet's balance becomes meaningless after the discovery of/exploitation of the flaw, and there's no way to go pick an old block in the chain, fix the protocol, and continue from there.

If I'm using a paper wallet and once in awhile i pull money off it into my Coinbase account, sending the change back into the paper wallet I'm pulling from, what risks am i running? Is it only privacy or something more? I create the transaction offline with javascript from a live boot cd.

In some of my more advanced math classes at the height of my intellectual achievements in college i could follow some complex mathematical proofs of non-obvious mathematical truths, but by the end i wouldn't be left with a permanent intuitive understanding. I understood every logical step and how it couldn't be any other way, but to hold the whole thing in my brain was beyond me.

Sort of, but Coinbase doesn't loan your money, especially not to people who can't afford their house, and you shouldn't keep a lot with any wallet website. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:34:19
Once you've transferred the money out of the wallet, it shouldn't matter whether you burn it or scan and post it to Reddit, right? In terms of the safety of your funds, anyway.

It was hard enough coming up with a protocol for ensuring everyone around the world knows that we know that we know that we know ... that we know a transaction occurred.
To go from that and just come up with a way to prove thousands of computers around the world "worked really hard" on the problem, and prove just how hard they worked, and prove it to every other node in the network, all nodes capable of signing off on how hard everyone else is working...
I'd be really interested to read about a solution to *that* problem.

I still think it'd be a difficult thing to pull off. You'd have to have:
1. Enough computing power to do it.
2. To steal enough money to be worth 
3. Not steal so much money in any single transaction that you immediately draw attention to the problem, and yet...
4. Sell your stolen bitcoin fast enough that you can be cashed out before everyone realizes the Bitcoin experiment is failing and chaos takes over for awhile until it either dies or is repaired.

You can make multiple deposits to a cold storage wallet over time, but to withdraw from it you either have to craft a transaction safely similar to how you original create your cold storage wallet, or you have to send all the leftover balance on to another cold storage wallet, seeing as you will have exposed your private key to an internet-connected computer.
I have a cold storage wallet which I monitor with the Blockchain android app. The private key is safe. To withdraw from it, I have to boot up my live cd and make a transaction which I transfer to an internet computer to push to the bitcoin network. Kind of a pain, which is why I have Coinbase as my "checking account".

It's like how fast food restaurants don't even make you sign or enter a PIN. The time just isn't worth it. Whereas if you're, say, buying a car, they can get you a coffee and tell you some more about your awesome new car while they wait for some confirmations.

I may be misunderstanding things, but if I do understand, then the terrible thing about rollbacks is that if a rollback is done, then everything done after whatever block we pick is completely lost in that it won't be included in the blockchain, meaning that if a problem arises where people start seriously debating a rollback, then wouldn't global commerce have to come to a standstill until the decision is made for fear of losing transactions?
There must be a better way of handling it than what I think is going on...

I would think the coins are sold rather quickly, and it is the transfer of the fiat from your coin manager to your bank account that takes time.

Blugh, I can't wait for Coinstar to start issuing your money in bitcoin. But then again, it's kind of fun to take your coin money and treat it like free money, spend it on stupid stuff. Doesn't feel quite the same after it blends in to your bank funds.

That fact is not at all clear. Granted, I've never spent any bitcoin, let alone doing it the hard way like on Brainwallet, but from my naieve perspective I've got the Generate Transaction page open, I changed the destination bitcoin value to 0.05, the source address is 50.00, and there is an input for the Fee, which still reads 0.05. I don't see how it can make sense for it to say a Fee of 0.05 but will actually eat the remaining 49.5.
But then again, I don't see how it would make sense to plug in the Source address BTC (50.0), so I probably don't know what I'm doing.

If i was to do it, I'd aside their paper wallets and give them on a Christmas when they're worth a substantial amount. If it loses its value, no big deal, rather than making sure you look foolish to everyone you sent one too.

Wholly agreed on the second point. 
With the first, not so much. Anywhere you receive our spend bitcoin is a potential contact point where your money can be traced to you. Buy a car? The dealer reports the income. If the IRS ever gets interested they'll want you to prove that money was taxed. Same deal when your employer pays you in bitcoin. If you're self employed and don't report all your income you're just asking to get probed. 
Tax evasion is serious business and in my opinion bitcoin makes it harder because it leaves a permanent trail.

Edit: Never mind. I keep forgetting they blocked exchanges from receiving deposits in CNY. For some reason I keep thinking the news was they blocked large deposits, not all deposits...
I've heard bits and pieces about China limiting how much wealth can be exported from China... I imagine this is on a per person basis. If that's the case, doesn't this open the door (wider) for black markets where individuals exchange CNY for whatever (BTC is now the easiest to work with) and turn around and sell their BTC to wealthy people, at a premium, for unblockable export of wealth?

For what it's worth, i was worried that Coinbase wouldn't find my credit union because Mint.Com always had trouble with it. When i was waiting for the two deposits to go through it took awhile and Coinbase sent me the reminder email before they went through, so i tried a second time with the leading 0's on my account number thinking that made it not work. In the end, i got the first attempt to work and deleted the second copy. 
It worked, but it took longer than i was led to expect. I have since made three purchases without problem.

Forgive me as I don't know much about virtualization, but is it possible that instructions injected into the actual hardware could be thwarted if it's not expecting to find and have to pry into a virtual machine?

Your comment triggered this thought so I thought I'd put it here...
I wish I could see a graph of value change... Like, if it dropped 50% in value, regardless of the fact that the value was only $10 at the time. Such a value change is huge, but on a graph of straight up value, $10 to $5 doesn't even show up when the current price is 3 digits.

Emphasis on testing with a small amount.
I'm currently waiting for a transaction of 0.001 (~60 cents) to clear, which could take a week, or I don't know what else can happen, because I didn't know how important including a transaction fee is.
Otherwise, my experiment looks like a success and I should be ready to print some cold storage wallets (with an additional test at that point to be sure).

In case you don't get a better answer: The math problem every miner is trying to solve is finding a hash with a value less than the target difficulty. The target difficulty is an agreed upon goal as outlined in the whitepaper and the software. When certain parameters are met, everyone knows what the next difficulty should be when it's time to adjust the difficulty, about every 14 days.
What is a hash? You get a hash by applying a one-way function to some data. The one-way function is designed such that, besides not being reversible (using the output to get the input), it also has good coverage (change one bit in the input and you get a completely different hash). This is done for things like signing a binary download of a Linux cd, so if someone replaces the iso binary, the hash won't match. Another use is user account passwords. Rather than storing everyone's password in a database so that if a hacker steals your database, they have everyone's password which they've potentially used for other services, you instead take their password when they create their account, hash it, store the hash, and throw away the password. Every time they log in you hash their input and if the resulting hash matches the stored hash from when they created their account, then what they input must have been the same password.
So if you have a set of data that will comprise the next block, and you want to try to generate a hash that is smaller than a target value (the smaller the target, the less likely it will "just happen" to be smaller than the target), you can change what you're hashing to get a different hash. Obviously you don't want to fuss around with the important data, so you add unimportant data to the total set of data, and then futz around with that meaningless data which causes the resulting hash to be different. (That unimportant data is called the nonce, I don't know why).
When someone somewhere in the world puts together a coherent, valid block, and finds a nonce for it that gives a hash lower than the target, they have a valid block, which they submit to the network, and it is quickly verifiable because checking a hash is quick.

Hi, just made a purchase.
I'm curious how you plan to handle payments made after the 1-hour cutoff for an order. I'm still new to bitcoin. I know Coinbase is a little different in how it pools bitcoin for its users, so if a payment were simply sent back to the address it came from, I don't know if Coinbase will recognize that as being for my account, or if it just disappears into the wider Coinbase funds.

It just occurred to me that once businesses are receiving paper wallet-bills as payment, it would be trivial for them to scan them, take the portion of payment they need, and dump the excess into the address scanned of another btc wallet in your possession at the time of sale. If you didn't have a phone or time to spare, it would be difficult/impossible to verify they actually gave your change until later, but with a national level business that would rarely be a problem.
