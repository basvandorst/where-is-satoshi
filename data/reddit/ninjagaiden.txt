Everybody uses bitcoinjs in the browser since a long time ago. What you actually did?

I would be careful before claiming that [bc.com]( stole you some btc:
1. [Blockchain.com]( does not have access to your private keys, therefore they cannot steal from you.
2. The mnemonic is generated client side and you are the only owner of it. Hence you can generate any address/private key. No matter if it is the 21st or the 100000th address. With that information you can spend your coins very easily.
3. If building a script by yourself to find your coins in hd-wallet is too hard, maybe you should not be dealing with BTC programatically. Blockchain does not provide you free tech consulting for your business.
4. On the other side, there was a obvious solution to your problem that a 5 year old child without coding skills could have. If you want to use [blockchain.com]( explorer but their service does not check further away the gap of 20 ... =&gt; CLOSE THE FUCKING GAP!. Let's say you have 20 addresses empty and you received funds to the 21. Just send some satoshis to the 11th address (or any in between 1 and 20). Now the gap will be less than 20 and your problem would have been solved.
I cannot understand how your money have been moved without your consent, but given the lack of education in cryptocurrencies you have shown... most likely your keys (mnemonic) were compromised somehow...

This is absolutely not true. The wallet provider cannot move your coins without your consent by any procedure. They do not hold the keys. You have been messing around with your mnemonic in your computer and with your clumsy attempts to recover your money you compromised it.

It is a fork of the [blockchain.info]( outrageous original android wallet and developed by a VERY incompetent developer. What could go wrong?
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:08:02
Omfg, the more I look into it the creepier. If you inspect the original commit they were even using the blockchain.info API. Because it was the same fucking wallet.
Good luck using this rehashed stuff...

They are so ninja, that they are a ninja fork of the mass beloved blockchain.info wallet. 
Look how similar are these two files. They still hold some equal comments and structure. And judging by the messy code base I would say is developed by pretty incompetent/inexperienced developers. Judge yourself.

Well, you are free to create your wallet and impose those restrictions. Enforcing that is pretty hard, I have seen noob users type on paper the words just to answer the verification step just after that and then destroy the paper. On the other side, those things add friction to your app while not solving the issue you want to solve. It is quite hard to protect the user from himself while annoying for the rest of the users too.

Also, over the years I have not seen any noob user being able to persist over time the mnemonic. Almost a 100% don't even remember they typed some words in a piece of paper and less its location.

It is very easy to trash [blockchain.com]( and a popular feeling but I think you are the main culprit of that problem you are suffering. First of all, you are responsible for backing up your mnemonic. No matter what wallet you use, you have to do that. If you don't do that you are at your own risk. Secondly, it is most likely that this password you think is ok it is actually wrong. [Blockchain.com]( just stores the data of you wallet encrypted with your password in a database. When you log in, they just try to decrypt that data and if the password is the same it just works. It is pretty simple and not much to mess up here.
It is true that historically they have had different encryption systems and that could cause a correct password to fail if they are not trying the corresponding one. But when they try to decrypt a wallet they try all the historical methods they had. You can see the code here:[
If they were missing any system used for an old wallet, I would say there will be a lot more complains, not isolated cases like seems to be. So, I would say it is most likely that you password might not be correct.
A solution you could do is:Download the encrypted wallet from the [blockchain.c]( server. Then, you can use that piece of software that I linked to you to make an offline attack to your own wallet trying to decrypt it using their function with variations of your password. Anyone with some javascript knowledge should be able to do that.
