I can see the analogy to be honest. But I don't think it's valid. Myspace and fb were products on the same platform or protocol ie the internet. But the difference between bitcoin and alts is that they use a different network. Akin to big companies trying to use their own intranets when the internet first came out
But cheaper faster transactions are not the point of crypto. We have PayPal visa and cash to transact quickly and relatively cheaper, and now we have alts to do the same in crypto space.

Don't forget you could mine multiple bitcoins a day on your laptop in the early days so electricity costs weren't an issue
The tremendous need for electricity now to mine successfully now is as a result of the demand on wanting to mine bitcoin. If the price were to crash, miners would switch off, difficulty would drop, energy demand would drop.

@_date: 2018-01-03 22:03:07
That's like saying gold was pre mined by Neanderthals when they first collected it due to its shiny rare appeal.
Yeah the first users of Bitcoin were able to accumulate a lot, but that was when the network was tiny and a decentralised peer to peer currency was a novel concept. No one fucking used it for 4 years. 
No way you could consider Bitcoin  pre mined as satoshi et al mined it WHEN IT WAS OPEN SOURCED. The rest did it before it was released 
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:33:30
But isn't the price a current reflection of the markets valuation of what it's worth? 
I like bitcoin as the nearest literal example of a perfectly competitive market. Everyone knows the cap. Everyone knows the inflation rate. In the sense of a crypto with these laws that's when market cap is relevant. 
I agree with other crypto where the inflation rate is not hard wired then mkt cap is irreverent

I'm starting to think alts are the solution to the back log via atomic swaps
The fee is not for sending the money in the form of bitcoin, it's to transmit a message on the bitcoin network. The premium blockchain.  You could spend 20 dollars to send 20 dollars or to send 100 million dollars.
The fee someone chooses to spend is set independently from the miners, so if the price and therefore demand dropped, backlog and fees would drop. It's all market driven
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:39:39
Bitcoin was struggling recently in it's ability to process transactions, because of the massive demand suddenly placed on it.  now it Seems sluggish and useless as a means of transacting. But the tech is not why bitcoin is bitcoin .... the blockchain tech only gained acclaim AFTER bitcoin showed it's potential. Crypto was never supposed to be a means of making payment over internet.... that's what PayPal is for 
If the tech was so revolutionary, why didn't we see the alts rise like they have this year after the 2013 all time high? The blockchain was largely ignored for years.... but look at market now! Flooded with blockchain tech but the vast amount mimic each other. 
Bitcoin will succeed as the store of value of crypto
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:42:23
It was when it was the first. It was for 6 years. No fees. A frictionless means of transferring value.  I used to give bitcoin away free in 2013. I don't now due to the fees.....
Fast forward 5 years. Now the block chain concept is out.  All the naysayers disagreeing why bitcoin had value buying cheap coins hoping to mimic the gains. Blockchains are ubiquitous. Now to transact on the worlds premium blockchain you pay a fee to do so.
If bitcoin were to die tomorrow and the miners switch off then bitcoins transaction fees would be back to the old days. Sipple supply and demand right there. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:48:23
Imo I think the extra competitor's are in our favour. 
If it was just ripple storming ahead I would be worried,  but the fact cardano and the rest has also gained shows the fickleness of new money. don't forget this is new money trying to replicate bitcoins gains without any idea of the utility of what they're buying
The more competitors, the more saturation that comes along gives bitcoin more credibility as the premium store of value in cryptoland

Wrong analogy. Myspace and Facebook work on the same internet protocol. Bitcoin is it's own protocol. It's like saying coinbase was MySpace and then their dominance was taken over by a new exchange, i.e the face book
Sure there are other cryptographical protocols, but the rise of alts is like comparing when companies tried to build they're own intranets on the internet
Bitcoin got the concept of the blockchain out there. The argument against it was always that it can be copied.  big banks tried to copy To no avail. Now it's being constantly copied by alts gaining momentum, but the irony is that there are so many they will all saturate themselves
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:42:34

Gold is not a currency. Does that negate it's value?
The media deemed bitcoin not to be a currency in it's early days, not because of the fees which were negligible, but its value was so volatile. Now the volatility has dropped proportionally, and people say the fees mean bitcoin is not a currency. 
I think you nailed it in your last point. Bitoin as digital gold. Bitcoin was looking for its killer app for years. Inadvertently it has become its store of value, as new crypto has given the transactional utility of the space

You mine the Bitcoin network to get bitcoin the cryptocurrency. The hashing power is dedicated to mining the next block and should you be successful you are awarded bitcoin as an incentive for spending your processing power on it. 
But don't forget, bitcoin hasn't always had value ( I.e the famous story of 10,000 bitcoins for 2 pizzas). Back then you could mine hundreds of bitcoins a day on a powerful pc as the difficulty to mine bitcoin is related to the amount of people trying to mine it. Now more people are using the network its value has gone up and therefore more people are trying to mine to get the reward

@_date: 2018-01-07 22:50:27
No but the Bitcoin whitepaper was the first. By years.  I don't think the Creators of Bitcoin could never envisage the multiple other competing currencies we are seeing right now. They're vision for scaling was if bitcoin was the only blockchain.

 Localbitcoins. In the UK works really well. Pay higher prices vs exchanges (about £100 A coin 150 usd) but the convenience is worth as verification is easy and don't have to worry about sending money to exchange
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:46:48
 yes but the graph above is 'more detailed' because it doesn't just show at 75% drop to its lowest point as you are trying to highlight, it shows the drops in between the lows and highs on a logarithmic scale to show the effect of a percentage change over price exchange change
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:30:34
Yes bitcoin uses lots of energy but mining farms are mostly located by generators of SURPLUS energy. That's the difference. Not cheap necessarily, but surplus as in it goes to waste otherwise.
You can't turn off renewables and there are are times with non renewables where supply outstrips demand so what do you do with the surplus? You can't store it very well.
Andreas will explain

That's exactly why the graph is scaled that like that! Look up a logarithmic scale. If that data was shown linearly it would like like bitcoin had done nothing for 7 yrs then went vertical in year 8. The logarithmic graph shows the changes over time

I think the list is more chronological, with doge and ltc first competing in 2013
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:49:09
The reason for it is supply and demand. More people want to use the network so it costs more to do so. If the demand dropped, so would the transaction cost
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:39:59
But you immediately tried the transaction again right? Or when did you get in?

Argument still holds true even if it's 30 dollar due to the perfect market of supply and demand. If bitcoin dropped to 1 dollar what would the transaction fee be then? 0 Because no one would be using it. 
Yes fees are high, in fact that's why I don't give people free btc anymore. But I'm starting to get that that's what bitcoins killer app is now. We have always been looking for the killer app (I've been in since 2013) but the rise of the alts has shown they can be the transactional utility of crypto, and bitcoin can be the crypto gold
Edit: answered wrong thread
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:22:30
Why are the fees high? Due to demand to use the BTC network. They used to be free when BTC was out on its own an no one cared about crypto. Now alts are an alternative (now worth 200 billion), the cost of transacting on the world's premium block chain has gone up. If another alt usurps BTC then the transaction fee will be negligible again as demand will drop. Bitcoin works so well because it is a perfect market. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:12:37
Excellent rebuttal to the concerns on btc energy consumption 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:25:26
Bitcoin didn't always have this problem so its not correct to say bitcoin has excessive energy consumption. The increased energy is due to the increased demand. 
When people ask what the intrinsic value is of bitcoin, it can be seen as the energy used to secure the network.  
Also, big mining efforts set up next to renewable energy sources, where they have surplus energy that can't be stored and utilise that

BTC needed to be deemed as having characteristics of a currency in it's early days to be adopted. Then this year with the alts increasing it showed if you wanted to send money over a blockchain you viably could. 
The days of BTC needing to be a currency are over, spending 20 dollars to send a 100000 on the world's premium blockchain is a valid cost
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:25:51
Just posted similar.... ok I dubbed him the next Andreas but whatever
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:17:08
Bitcoin needed to be a currency initially to prove the utility of the blockchain. 
In 2014 we were all waiting for the app of the tech that gave bitcoin it's killer app. The we had the rise of the alts which gave bitcoin it's killer app inadvertently..... The world's premium blockchain as a store of future value. Now we have 26 coins worth more that 1 billion. We have 6 worth more than 10 billion.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:55:23

@_date: 2017-12-19 20:25:56
 but is it a problem? The fees in bitcoin  aren't inherent to bitcoin. They have come about due to a rise in demand for bitcoin and it's limited supply and block size. Don't forget fees used to be much lower or even free
And guess what..... Now there's multiple other blockchains to send value across.  If bitcoin (and thus crypto when there was hardly any other competitors) had this problem in 2013 it would have died on it arse. 
Fees are only an issue for small to microtransactions. If I was sending $1000 plus a $10 fee would be fine and it would be the same if I was sending $1,000,000. Market forces have dictated the fees on bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:28:32
I'm always up for well constructed discussion :) I'm not aware of the calculations you speak of though so can't comment on that, perhaps you could provide a link? Do you mean the price can be manipulated for $5k a day? 
As the OP linked video stated, blockchain technology is beginning to get acclaim for being a great technology as a way to combat the lack of trust in the financial system and other aspects of society. The trust is created by different and mutually exclusive participants involved in maintaining the integrity of the blockchain and ensuring there are no fraudulent entries. The reward for putting computing power towards maintaining the ledger is the bitcoin (or any other alt-coin) token and acts as an incentive for the miners to maintain the ledger. Therefore other blockchains without a token to transmit information across it would not work as the trust would not be there, as no one is going to put computing power towards something for free.  The argument that a financial institution/s could create its own blockchain (without the need for the reward token) would therefore not work as the institution would be responsible for its upkeep and therefore the trust is not there. 
So yes secure is a relative term, but a blockchain that has a token as a reward for the mining will be perceived much as much more secure as one that is centrally maintained
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:48:59
No. Usd has no intrinsic value. Neither does bitcoin. I was trying to give an example as to why mining give bitcoin value for the masses that give it no value. I didn't goggle where mines are but if they're not located by areas where cheap renewable surpluses are then they are doomed
@_date: 2015-06-11 17:39:25
a database is not the same as a blockchain :) But yes, there are other blockchains, with the token of transfer called alt-coins, but due to lack of participants in the network these are not as secure and therefore have less utility

I disagree. You are correct about it not effecting individuals at the present moment, and only incentivising the commercial banks to lend more to boost the economy, but it does not mean nothing to us. 
It is an unprecedented step by a major central bank, and this could have been translated by some as the sign of weakening fiat currency as a whole in the future. The whales that caused the recent price rise aren't necessarily the banks, just high net worth individuals who perceived it as reason to go to bitcoin, and wanted to do so before the news got out.

Bitcoin was created due to the last recession and associated money printing/ bail outs by western governments. 
Bitcoin became an alternative for people who see that fiat money steals wealth from the middle and lower class with its money printing. 
It may be harder for the average Joe to have any surplus income to buy, but when high net worth individuals fully accept it as a safe haven as the economy tanks, it will be great for bitcoin.

Accumulating satoshis, or stacking sats as its otherwise known, refers to buying small amounts of bitcoin when you can
I.e if you buy 50 dollars of bitcoin today you still get 500,000 satoshis or 500,000 units of bitcoin.

I was under the assumption with was how NASDAQ intends to utilise the blockchain for processing trades? i.e make a particular satoshi represent a particular stock or units of stock (colour it). The transaction would be signed to confirm who owns the stock. When you sell your shares, the satoshi would be transfered to the new owner and signed in his name to prove ownership. The fact that the transfer of wealth is a fraction of a the cost of the fees to transfer it, it is insignificant when compared to the value of the stock it represents?

I think the only way the brexit could possibly be a good thing (for me as a bitcoin holder) is that it will cause the pound, the oldest fiat money in the world, to be shaken its core, and therefore legitimise bitcoin.
It's easy to deride bitcoin when you live in western economy that is not subject to currency shocks
We've seen how the Bolivar has crashed so hard in the last few years, and the West has laughed it off as it's only a minor economy. 
Imagine if a major currency goes the way of the Bolivar? The pound is down at least 25% since the vote and brexit hasn't even happened yet. Its Almost at parity with The euro, before brexit 100 pounds would get you 140 euros. 
The ball has stated rolling, more companies pulling out, there will be a brain drain of the best people lured aboard to escape the mess.....
As an avid remainer, the likelyhood of bitcoin adoption increasing is the only plus side

No, the report says economic textbooks are wrong about how fractional reserve banking is how money is created in the U.K 
If a loan applicant is deemed credit worthy, the commercial bank creates the loan by creating the money. I.e just adding numbers to their account

What about when it hit $1000 in late 2013 and dropped to $200 by mid 2015? 
There were people saying the same thing then on the buttcoin sub

Can't believe the article says the origin of HODL is an acronym for Hold On for Dear Life when it was just a typo of HOLD
True hodlers chill when price crashes, as the article confirms. It's the complete opposite of holding on for dear life

I disagree. Bitcoin was not premined. It had 0 monetary value for 18 months and it's supply has increased to where it is now from nothing on a slow pre determined basis. 
I agree market cap is worthless as a metric for many crypto coins, but for bitcoin it is as valid as valuing Apple by its market cap

Don't forget the potential for a bad Brexit to destroy the U.K economy.
It will tank the pound, and we could see massive QE and helicopter money, and potentially the fall of the oldest fiat money in existence
@_date: 2019-04-22 12:53:17
So why did the pound vs euro exchange fall right after the referendum result was released? 
I think that was the market deciding who was going to be stronger in or out.... and that was on the assumption of a smooth brexit not the shitshow it has become. 
The UK net contribution is only 20 billion, not to much too make up for the other members

Just look at the hash rate for bitcoin and the computing power dedicated to it without any guarantee of return.
 Yeah anyone can make a cryptocurrency but if no-one mines it then it is no different to a computerised ledger. Don't forget, when bitcoin was created it was worth nothing, the hash rate was near 0, and it took a few years before it had any value at all. If bitcoin was released now it would fail

There is some merit to this. When the initial fork happened it was due to lack of concenus. Consensus that was tried to be forged for 2 years in how to scale and was not going anywhere. When it was obvious concenus was not going to happen, that was when alts took off. Maybe by agreeing segwit 2x with segwit happening first then the 2x later was a way to get the majority of the actors to agree to give some stability
@_date: 2018-07-29 09:04:02

The bear market days are over. Just because we had a 2 year bear market before doesn't mean we'll have another now. We've had 4 sustained bear markets after meteoric rises. Btc wins long term. I feel that the cats out of the bag enough now.... btc is up 5 times this year yet lost half off it's crypto dominance.  so Crypto has proven it's self, either Bitcoin will win or some other. My money's on bitcoin

It's the increased utilization of surplus renewables. The marginal cost of bitcoin production is zero with free energy
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:42:23
How can you say is irrelevant then? Mkt cap is the best indicator of demand for something. Shitcoins may have relatively high mkt cap with low volume but the fact they have a high price shows that they must be in demand. Btc was 85% dominant 8 months ago. It dropped to 40% in the summer (still gained in usd value 3x though) now its recovering back to nearly 60. This is massive when looking at how much crypto as a whole mkt cap has risen. If btc still maintained its previous dominance with the same money in crypto add a whole we'd be over 10k
@_date: 2018-07-05 15:38:08
 So true. They do the same at r/buttcoin. I remember when they used to bash Bitcoin, now they consider all the alts to be the same as bitcoin

When btc is used for transactions via companies like bitpay, the vendor has choice to keep the btc or have the amount converted to fiat instantly. As goods are priced in fiat to btc and is converted immediately the volatility has no effect on the vendor if they want the fiat.

correct me if i'm wrong, but the whole security aspect of a distributed network is based upon the fact that the more players in the network, the more secure it is? The IBM coin network would only have a small amount of players involved and maintaining the network, therefore making it no different to the current legacy banking system?

Leah didn't suspect it was hal as he always said it wasn't him. She and the bitcoin community acknowledged he received the first transaction, and there was a few people in the community who suspected him but no proof. It was the fact that dorian lived in the same town that was her primary basis for suspecting him
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:10:03
I disagree. The higher the hash rate, the higher the difficulty, the higher the integrity of the bitcoin blockchain over other blockchains
@_date: 2016-07-25 22:54:29
You are forgetting you live 
in the US and have a stable currency. Have the same argument with yourself imagining you live in a country with a crashing currency i.e Venezuela. Strictly speaking the dollar and bolivar are both fiat currencies, both backed by governments,yet you wouldn't accept bolivar even at a large premium. Value is subjective. You are struggling to see how bitcoin has value, yet you value the dollar even though it is just printed on a whim from nothing?

Exactly. If you were sending her $10,000 and you had to pay $5 in fees would you complain? No.  You choose to send value via bitcoin.You're spending the fee as you are sending your value on the worlds premium blockchain. If you wanted to show her the tech of crypto you could just send on another block chain litecoin for example and not pay the fees (as much). I think fees are integral to why the bitcoin blockchain is worth more then others......it's supply and demand and nothing more, other alts have been around for ever since bitcoin so the technology of the blockchain is not the thing.

I think it's hal finney. First to receive a bitcoin transaction, then a cypto programmer with CIA called dorian nakamto is uncovered that lives in the same town as him..... a great ploy to frame DN and keep people off his trail if Hal was the creator. Plus I have this dream that he will be thawed out in 25 years and be the richest man on earth!

I don't think Western governments will ban Bitcoin because they are full of politicians who are just people who ultimately act (even if in only a small way) in their own self interest. 
By the time it becomes big enough to scare the U.S government sufficently to warrant it being banned, many politicians will be holders and they will block a ban as they would be harming their own self interests.
