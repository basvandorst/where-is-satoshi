GL with finding someone to trust.

They have been in BTC for years and started an exchange.  They truly believe in it, it's not just them pumping it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:49:34
sure.  how much BTC do you need?  
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:52:43
LOL. so what.  just restore your wallet with your seed words.  you didn't lose anything outside of the cost of the Ledger.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:55:54
not even a good attempt at begging.  Losing the hard wallet means nothing since the "beggar" could just restore with seed on some other wallet.

Who knows.  The people who can crash it are the ones with 100's of millions of dollars.  The majority of us chumps have no idea whether they want to dump or pump it until it's too late.

TA analysis is a joke...especially in crypto markets.

My BMO harris buy from my bank account from 3/8 went through.
Maybe debit card doesn't work but the bank transfer from BMO still does.

oops.  ok. thought they were same bank, my mistake.  I'm with BMO Harris which obv isn't relevant to this thread.

sent a bunch of transactions today.  most of them with .04 transaction fee.  They all confirmed within 20 minutes...some within 5 minutes.
RIP BCash.

People all think they have perfect memory until they don't.  Concussion or some brain injury could screw you.
I guess if you have a trusted spouse or something then it would be safer.  Otherwise relying on a single point of failure (especially the flawed human mind) could end up badly.

you don't need another trezor.  you can restore with ur seed phase on other wallets like electrum or ledger.
Your seed phrase is what's important.  Losing your Trezor doesn't really matter.
