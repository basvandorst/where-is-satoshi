There is a lot of confusion behind what the halving actually is. Miners will be getting half of the reward for the same amount of work from their video cards. No bitcoin are being destroyed or anything, the difficulty is being adjusted and the price always goes nuts the weeks leading up to and after halvings

Wait until they hit 18 and give them a nice warm welcome into the world of crypto. Its a rite of passage with investors, we all have to go through the learning process and many give up before they get there. But hey..more kids turning 18 = more people getting into crypto later and later putting us ahead of the game.

The hard part is finding someone you trust to help you. You could send a friend $325 cash on cashapp and they could send you $325 bitcoin in return, Im sure that would be less than any fees you would get from anything else.

You would have still received your funds. Trezor allows you to either keep using old addresses or generate new ones. It shows all the addresses you used and how much you received in each of them. Try sending 0.001 btc to the other address. It will go through.
Edit : I have never used exodus so I may be wrong in your case.
