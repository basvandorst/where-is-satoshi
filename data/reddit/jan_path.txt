Agreed, but it would make even more sense to use uBTC instead of bits.
@_date: 2014-07-25 12:19:25
Only one small outgoing transaction from the ether presale address was made so far. Therefore all bitcoins which were sold for ether were just removed from the market for now. That should rather increase the price of bitcoin than decrease it.

A simple worth_tipping subreddit could do the job as well. Than everyone could still decide what to tip and what not so the personal aspect doesn't get lost and we the tipping would be coordinated so actual amounts come together.

You don't put an infinite number of decimal places when you speak about distances just because they are infinitely dividable do you? So why should you write out all 8 decimal places of Bitcoin just because the protocol limits you to them?
Satoshi aren't the base unit. BTC are the base unit. The only reason why we have satoshi as the smallest possible division is because Satoshi (the person(s)) arbitrarily decided that transactions below 10^-8 BTC don't make sense and just unnecessarily bloat the blockchain.
If there should ever be a need for transactions below 10^-8 BTC the protocol will be altered to allow them and than you could have 0.12345 uBTC aka "bits".
If you want two decimal points just round to two decimal points.

Why are there no parallels? Both uBTC aka bits and the Zimbabwe dollar are measurements of currencies and both have a very small value.

Mining one bitcoin will always cost about one bitcoin (with some lag). If the cost was much lower mining would be really profitable, so more money would be invested into it, raising the difficulty and raising the cost of mining one bitcoin until it is not profitable anymore. Since price has been pretty stable for some time it is not surprising at all, that mining one bitcoin costs close to one bitcoin right now.

That is not possible. You need to open a port and forward it from the router to your computer, so that your client can accept incoming connections from other clients. There is UPnP, which is supposed to make this plug and play, but it is per default disabled on most routers for security reasons.

When the value of 1 bitcoin falls under $1 production of blocks will cease per the bitcoin protocol. They added that together with segwit to conserve energy in the case that bitcoin fails.

Pretty sure I can type faster with the regular 1-0 stretch of numbers, as that way I only have to move my hands 2 cm up instead of like 5 meters to the side and can actually use 8 fingers instead of just 3.
Also having your mouse that far to the side is not very ergonomic.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:20:06


If you have a long keyboard your mouse has to be further to the side, so you have to bring your arm in a more awkward position to use it.
Otherwise I can see its use if you type a lot of numbers mixed with special characters, that are easily accessible from the numpad (tab, enter and space are very accessible with your hands over the regular number stretch). But I rarely do and therefore the added size of the keyboard is not worth it.

But I don't see how anything that POW/POS are trying to guarantee goes against the collective interests of rich people.
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:37:21
As long as you have a chain state that already has sufficient distribution of stake that you know is valid you can determine the valid chain from there. Being able to determine the valid chain even without that seems to be a rather irrelevant advantage to me.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:45:33
I'll take any guarantee that works. If there are multiple such candidates I'll take the cheapest.
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:35:30
Except there is an alternative that doesn't consume ridiculous amounts of energy: proof of stake.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:57:28
Control what? POS and POW are really just there to prevent double spending and they both work fine for that. One could argue that maybe one mechanism may be more prone to discrimination in what transactions are included, but I think neither is sufficiently centralized to allow something like that.
Furthermore I think POW is a lot more centralized. With POW the amount of money expended for mining should be just below the block rewards plus fees. So if you want to do a 51% attack you would have to spend at most that amount. Probably a lot less, as other miners would stop mining if you make put enough mining power in to make mining unprofitable. With POS you need 51% of the active market cap.
In practice as well: POW is not very decentralized with most mining being done in large scale farms.

This seems not that big to me. This was always possible if the attacker is on the same wifi network as you. So if you used public networks in the past you have no reason to be more afraid than yesterday.
Also using HTTPS or any encrypted protocol protects you against this. Furthermore injecting malware into websites should only be able to do things like steal the data you actually share with that website (eg. your password). It should not be possible to infect your computer just by browsing a website. Not unless your browser has some major vulnerability.
@_date: 2015-04-12 12:49:54
Some people prefer the actual programming and others prefer the conceptional ground work.
You need both of them, because you can't just program something without first having decided what algorithms to use.  That might work if you program something straightforward like say a music player but not for something as complicated as Bitcoin.  (Even in the case of a music player you need things like search and sorting algorithms and bayesian rating)
Neither can you just ship a bunch of whitepapers of cause.
@_date: 2015-04-14 15:41:50
Of cause you can.  You can't write a paper explaining a whole piece of software, but for common sub-problems it works.
For example if you wrote a game engine, among many other problems you would be confronted with pathfinding.  Researching it you would probably end up reading a lot of theoretical articles and papers about search algorithms, navigation meshes, steering behaviour etc..
If your writing non-trivial software you don't want to reinvent the wheel for every single sub-problem.  On the one hand because that would be very time consuming and on the other hand because your solutions would probably be far from optimal while others have already dedicated their lives to finding optimal solutions for most of your problems.
Just using a third party library doesn't always work either.  For example in the case or an game engine if you had ten libraries for ten sub-problems they would probably expect ten different data representations of the world.  Making them communicate would add significant overhead.
edit: Returning to the topic, Vitaliks whitepaper isn't about making Bitcoin Ethereum, but about how to make cryptocurrencies in general more scalable which is very desirable for anyone creating a cryptocurrency.  And guess what: You can't package those improvements in a library.
(Disclaimer: I didn't read the paper)
@_date: 2015-04-12 15:18:12
They do, if your idea helps to further their idea.  For example every programmer uses a variety of algorithms they didn't invent like sorting algorithms etc.

No need to buy an SSD for that. If you have enough RAM, you can just use that, by using a tmpfs. Here is a linux tutorial:
1. There is always a tmpfs mounted at /tmp. The size of this will per default be half your RAM size. See if you still have enough space on there:
        df -h /tmp
    If there is still enough space there, move to 2.. Else you will have to increase the size by adding or editing this line to your `/etc/fstab`:
        tmpfs   /tmp         tmpfs   nodev,nosuid,size=&lt;XY&gt;G          0  0
    &lt;XY&gt; being the desired size in gigabytes. Then `mount -o remount /tmp`.
2. `mv ~/.bitcoin/chainstate ~/.bitcoin/chainstate_bk`
3. `ln -s /tmp/chainstate ~/.bitcoin/chainstate`
3. Use [this script]( to start bitcoin. It will copy `~/.bitcoin/chainstate_bk` to `/tmp` and sync `/tmp/chainstate` back to `~/.bitcoin/chainstate` once bitcoin is stopped and every 10 minutes.
I have not tested the script much, but it seems to work.

Yeah, I worried a bit about that as well. Thanks for the advise. I will incoperate them into the script soon. I think one should only use it to sync up. For continued use it is probably not worth it.

Despite that it's not going to happen anyway, Bitcoin has some major scalability issues that would have to be addressed first.
The most obvious being the 7 tps limit.  Almost no one could afford to run a full node.
Another issue would be that with prices sky-rocketing mining would do as well and the energy waste due to mining is already huge.  I don't think I would want to see a proof-of-work currency to see such a huge adoption.
