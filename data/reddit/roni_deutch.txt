You should have bought it when it was $20...or less.

Currency of the future
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:58:10
How liquid is something like this? Say you wanted to sell all 72 bitcoins today. How easy is it to actually convert what you have to cash? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:18:22
BTC isn't currently a currency, its a tool for speculation. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:28:30
McAfee is a moron. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:28:13
Bitcoin's price needs to stabilize and come back down to reality if it's ever going to be a semi-legit currency. The point of currency is to spend it on things. But no one is going to spend bitcoin if they constantly see its price move higher and higher every day. 
That's whats wrong with this whole thing. You have people insisting its a currency but trading it purely on speculation. It's proponents aren't actually allowing it to become a useful currency because they're greedy and think the price will never stop going up. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:20:40
This just means intense regulation is on the horizon. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:59:35
This type of question is why bitcoin will inevitably crash and people will lose a ton of money. Because the people buying/investing in it have absolutely no clue what they're doing. 
Edit: word
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:10:33
Oh okay. So never. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:55:04
Are precious metals being promoted as currency?
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:21:41
In this sub fake news includes anything people don't agree with. People are going to look very dumb when it comes out that this isn't just a rumor. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:41:47
Yeah u/patatoo has no clue what he is saying
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:10:21
Haha, whoops. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:07:31
Okay so what fundamentals do people trade on?
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:18:57
Not really a good comparison at all. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:10:13
Hahaha perfectly stated. This place and these people are a joke. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:32:46
Links would be helpful, because right off the bat the cumulative inflation rate from 2007 - 2017 was 18% not 50%. Over the last 20 years it has risen between 2-4% yearly. Generally speaking, this is quite low and comparable to countries like the UK, Germany, and Japan. Also, the fact that interests rates have been raised recently is a sign that the economy is growing and this could even strengthen the dollar. 
Is the US economy in perfect shape? Nope. Will there be a market correction sometime soon? Probably. But low unemployment rates, 2-3% GDP, and low inflation and no deflation are all clear signs of a healthy economy. 
Like you said, recessions historically happen. So if you're young like you say you are, you shouldn't let this scare you into placing your entire savings in a highly speculative cryptocurrency. If you are doing this to just try and get rich quick I can respect that, but your previous reasoning doesn't really add up. 
Edit 1: Schiff also claimed that gold would reach $5000/ounce a few years after 2008. Hasn't even come close. He is also a libertarian, who called for hyperinflation by 2011 or 2012. I am sure for every correct prediction hes made in his life hes made 10 wrong ones, so I wouldn't put all your faith in this guy. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:04:11
Cool story 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:29:31
You shouldn't be surprised or upset that people are selling bitcoin when it is an entirely speculative play. If it wasn't it would never have reached these levels to begin with. Be happy that you have ton of idiots trying to get rich quick.
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:19:56
I guess Bloomberg also reporting on rumors now?
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:01:02


If there were a place to do this effectively you would be a rich rich man or woman. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:52:41
People in this sub are notoriously ill informed fanboys. Of course they don't actually know the history of the financial crisis 
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:19:11
I guess Bloomberg is now fake news as well?
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:24:11
Umm, according to history...
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:06:38
Tinfoil hat engaged!
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:00:16
Yeah, I would suspect China has a pretty huge ownership stake in Bitcoin at this point. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:47:10
Is that was OP was referencing? Nope, didn't think so. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:24:35
Absolutely 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:01:31
Yeah, it's basically impossible to time any market. Don't try to.
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:16:33
You still want to have some diversity in your portfolio. Like any investment, bitcoin is not a sure thing. And in the event of a downturn you do not want to be 100% exposed to a single investment source. Kind of an ill-informed strategy. 
Also, if your argument is that he can accept the risk because he is young, than it doesn't really make sense to cite equities as a shitty investment near term because you shouldn't be worrying about short term price fluctuations. If you're investing in index funds that track the broad market you're going to make money in the long term. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:10:13
Hahaha perfectly stated. This place and these people are a joke. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:55:08
Not at all. Read a book. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:28:15
How exactly is the economy more sick now than it was in 2009? What do you see causing the next recession?
Also, what is the point of arguing that the stock market is the most expensive it has ever been when bitcoin is also at its highest levels ever. Do you really believe the growth it has seen over the last year is sustainable or even logical?
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:03:46
No, he is correct.

Need more tinfoil on your hat. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:22:38
I should know better. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:58:27
If $300 is all the money you are saving every month, please do not put it all in bitcoin. That is an objectively terrible financial move.  
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:21:13
But this sub was very clear. That was all fake news! 
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:46:36
How exactly do you know this? Isn't not being able to determine ownership one of the main points of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:56:08
Hey, someone in here who actually knows and understands history instead of thinking some ill informed Redditor just burned JP Morgan. Good in you. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:49:16
haha yeah, go with that. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:18:49
Guess WSJ and Bloomberg are also fake news now. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:30:51
Man I wish I got something. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:41:34
Really? What are the underlying fundamentals? What's the intrinsic value? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:59:33
never take financial advice from anyone in this sub
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:40:57
I was being sarcastic 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:23:26
You shouldn't be all that surprised. This sub is one giant circle jerk made up of ill informed speculators and conspiracy theorists. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:41:34
Really? What are the underlying fundamentals? What's the intrinsic value? 
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:03:36
But this sub told me it was all fake news yesterday...
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:54:54
ITT: people who have no idea what actually happened during the last financial crisis and think JP Morgan/Chase were bailed out because they failed. Read a book r/bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:29:14
Yeah, I can't wait to live in a constant state of paranoia and faux enlightenment. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:45:48
I post because I don't think subs that promote paranoia, delusions, and risky financial advice should go unchecked. 
Also, there is a big difference between thinking critically and thinking everything is some big conspiracy to control the masses. I like to partake in the former.
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:41:03
What exactly are the fundamentals?
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:23:26
You shouldn't be all that surprised. This sub is one giant circle jerk made up of ill informed speculators and conspiracy theorists. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:15:31
Important, yes. But it's something entirely separate from the tweet and point of the original post. If it was relevant maybe that should have been the headline. But when you blindly support and latch on to misinformed tweets like what OP posted it just shows how utterly clueless you are. It certainly doesn't help people respect any legitimate arguments you might make. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:45:51
This much movement in this little time makes no sense in any market. The volatility of bitcoin is insane. Could definitely make a ton of money but just as easily loose it. I certainly wouldn't trust bitcoin as my main investment vehicle. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:32:06
It's worth reading his [entire memo] ( or at least the portion on cryptocurrenices to put it into context rather than just reading a few quotes picked by business insider. The guy may be a "dinosaur" as he admits, but it's still interesting to read his take, considering he has been doing this for longer than I bet most bitcoin holders have been alive. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:56:56
He also just said bitcoin is clearly in a bubble. So there's that 
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:09:32
Fair point and well put. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:01:40
It's naive and ignorant if you think a currency that holds monetary value (ie. bitcoin) wont be susceptible to the powers of greed. It's simple human nature, and just because Satoshi created it on principle doesn't really mean much about it's future. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:08:07
Not sure how seriously I can take someone who said people wont be trading stocks in 10 years. What an utterly clueless statement.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:33:06
Well explain it and enlighten me. That's what discourse is about.
