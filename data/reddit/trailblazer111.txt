I didn't mean his job would get him the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The job just keeps the proverbial wolf away from the door until the value of bitcoin eventually makes it way to new highs.
The guy needs to stop trading, and simply hold his position.
95% of professional money managers fail to beat the long term average return of the stock market. 
They fail because they think they can out-trade the market like this guy has done.
This guy needs to be realistic about the fact that he doesn't know what he is doing.
His remarks clearly sound like somebody who fails, or more accurately stated.....refuses to admit that he doesn't know what he is doing as a trader.
He wants to sound like he is just running into "irrational markets" but the reality is, he bought too high, traded emotionally instead of intelligently, and now he lacks the discipline to allow the markets to work their way through this price point.

No thanks. If you were standing in front of me.....I would take that bet. But how would I collect when you lose?
To much hassle when I can make the same bet with a friend over coffee.

I totally agree with you.

Triple bottom on the daily chart.
This is the first time since the downtrend started 11 months ago that we are sitting in an oversold on the Williams% while simultaneously the MACD is finally above the zero point line.
There is a high probability that we see a reversal very soon (next 1-3 days). How big the reversal is? Who knows? 
I don't know how big.....but its coming, and right here at $355 is where people should back up the truck, because this reversal is coming.

I have handled 6000 transactions worth millions of dollars and there has never been a single problem with the Blockchain wallet, or one incident of theft...so frankly, you don't have a clue about what you are talking about.

The indicators have been flashing sell for months. So for me they have been working like a charm.
Today was the first time in months they  have flashed a buy signal.
Time will see.
Don't give up on indicators...they do put you into higher probability trades more than if they were not used at all.

I have traded stocks for over 20 years. I spent years studying fundamentals, and even more years studying technical.
With that being the case, I understand how you have come into your situation. You may not want to hear this, but I think the facts back up my statement. 
The truth is, you have no idea what you are doing, and you only had a temporary illusion of knowing what you were doing.
I use the MACD and other TI like you do, but I can tell you right now that if you keep buying every time the price drops by $40.....this is a clear sign, that you are not trading properly.
You are probably misguided in your assumption that shorter term technical are going to help you with short term trend analysis. There is a grain of truth, but in reality, your best advice if you wish to continue technical trading is to start looking at weekly charts as your technical timeframe. Avoid using hourly charts, or 2 hour charts, or even daily charts. They are not long enough.
You always want to be examining every trade from the longest time horizon possible, which is why I use weekly charts.
If you look at the weekly chart, you will see the MACD is giving a reading of about 95 or 96. 
This is massively oversold, and is a great time to step in. This is exactly where you buy. 
Even though things are oversold right now, doesn't mean they cannot go lower, and they might.
Yet from a technical traders standpoint....right here, and right now  at $350 is where I am banging the table to friends and family saying "This is a good buying point, assuming you are willing to simply hold....not trade....just hold, and be willing to hold for a couple years"
Just my 2 cents. I have been in your position, and feel your pain my brother. Keep your chin up, stop trading, and just hold what you have. 
Get your job underway, and within a couple years, your family money will be back to the lofty levels you started with.
Good luck.

The evidence is about 1000 different complaints about the scumbag owner.
My guess is that since you seem to defend the service that you are probably the same scumbag owner doing your best to lure additional victims into your web of deceit.

You registered for the first time so you could make this ignorant hate-filled comment?
You call me the dipshit when you are the fool who actually thinks that one person can move a multi-billion dollar market 20% with modest buying.
Go ahead and throw a million bucks at the market.....you will not budge it more than a percentage point or two for a matter of minutes.
Your words remind me of the famous Winston Churchill quote:
"Light travels faster than sound, which is why some people appear bright before you hear them speak."

BitPlastic is a total scam website and anybody who Googles "Bitplastic scam" will see a never ending sea of complaints about the scammer scumbag owner who buys accounts at Bitcointalk.org to act as if he is a client of the service.
Avoid Bitplastic at all costs or he will steal your money.

Okay Sir Talksalot,
I suppose you have at least a basic understanding of reading charts. 
Any trader worth a salt can tell by looking at this chart that we are about to reverse.
If you don't know how to read charts, then pick up a book instead of hurling insults.

I am talking about Bitstamp current prices. You are talking something else.

Bitcoin will be adopted much faster than the internet.
The cost of computers where ridiculously expensive back in 1995...thousands of dollars for a half way decent one (which sucks by today's standards)...yet people forked out the dough.
There is no financial commitment like this necessary from the average man with bitcoin.
You can sell things and receive bitcoin....you can accept your wages in bitcoin.....absolutely zero barrier to entry costs associated with bitcoin. (unless you go and buy it obviously).
I still think it will take many years...but the financial hurdles do not exist in bitcoin, in the same way they did 20 years ago with the creation of the internet.
(Obviously this excludes any costs associated with an outright purchase of bitcoin).
Additionally....buying a computer and paying for an internet connection was a cost which was never expected to be recouped....or much less profited from, as compared to bitcoin, which holds the potential to actually reward a user financially; and in fact has rewarded every single person who has held their bitcoin for more than a year thus far.

How are you supposed to glean anything from that? You don't have any indicator activated? 
Start inputting some indicators like MACD, MACD histogram, RSI or Williams
All you are showing is basic candlestick charts. That's why you are failing to see what I am seeing.

You can search my past posts. I have never called the bottom before this.

I got into bitcoin at $60 each. I don't feel dumb at all.
This is not a throwaway account. It was opened 2 months ago, and is the only account I use.
You are the one with the throwaway account with your whopping 1 post.
Since you didn't listen to Winston Churchill...perhaps Mark Twain is a better author to quote with reference to your stupidity:
“It's better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than open it and remove all doubt”
