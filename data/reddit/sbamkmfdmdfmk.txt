Me too. Not complaining, but still confused.

Microcenter won't be able to do shit. You'll have to shell out some cash to someone who's specialized in data recovery from fire damage like  but it if it means saving 17 BTC, it'll be worth it.

That's why neither my parents nor my in-laws know that we've got 10 BTC.

Ah... Didn't connect all the dots in my brain at first! Thanks!
EDIT: for anyone else who didn't get it, the limit of 21mm BTC means that as the dollar inflates, the finite amount of BTC will continue to increase in comparative value (or technically, USD will continue to decline in value relative to BTC)

Most recovery companies will give you a quote/eval beforehand.

I'd just like to add to this by letting you know DON'T TAKE OUT A FUCKING MORTGAGE ON YOUR HOUSE YOU GODDAMN IDIOT.

In that there is a limited supply that cannot be expanded once it hits 21m mined BTC

My BTC, which I've held for only 8 months, are today worth more than my 11+ years of investing into my 401(k)

Kind of like saying "each and every troy pound of gold also consists of 5,760 grains!"

Since it crashed and then crossed $10k a second time, I think he has to eat both his balls.

The guy just tweeted OP's article with no rebuttal or defense.  
There's a fine line between clever and stupid.

Exactly. Instead of following the media FUD, I watched the video of his comments -- he never said anything about trying to prevent Bitcoin/crypto. He just said it's not legal tender in India, i.e. you can't use it to purchase things directly (yet, anyway). And he said that they would crack down on use of crypto for FUNDING ILLEGAL ACTIVITY (I have no problem with that). He didn't say they were going to stop people from trading Rupees for crypto and then went on to praise Blockchain tech.

This is actually a correct answer. When I used to day trade stocks 10 years ago, I just put summaries. I had a spreadsheet to back up the fine details of my buys/sells, but on my Schedule D I just put my average cost of buys and my average cost of sells.

Hell, it almost hit 8k a half hour ago.
