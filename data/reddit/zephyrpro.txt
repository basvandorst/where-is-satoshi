At least now you can't lose the bet.

BTC the way it is right now is NOT decentralized. Small groups of developers control the future of it and large mining pools control its fate. If that's not enough there's people with too much power in the BTC world that can change the price by dumping their coins.

If only I was a tech hipster 7 years ago.
@_date: 2017-03-28 05:59:52
Why is everyone taking this so literally lol... he could also buy all the hashing power and crash the coin for much cheaper.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:01:58
I wasn't suggesting that a new leader suddenly appear, just saying that in some situations a leader could be helpful. In Bitcoin's case however, everyone is only supporting it for the decentralization and the belief that only they should be able to control their money. A leader wouldn't work since it would go against what most Bitcoin followers believe in.
However, if people knew history they'd see that usually it's centralized states that are more successful. This may open things up to corruption and other related problems, but decentralization doesn't usually work well as can be seen with all the current issues and debates that are happening with Bitcoin and are slow to resolve.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:54:12
Sometimes we need a leader to follow though. Otherwise the community splits and everything is worse off than if a slightly bad idea goes through.

Back to the moon boys!

Same, decided to put in around 5 bucks yesterday. Now that 5 bucks is getting closer to 4 bucks, sorry everyone.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:39:13
I think we should just pause this whole debate right now and go back to the moon.
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:42:54
I'm just pointing out that any wealthy individual could topple BTC if they wanted. Not saying it will happen.

If you have enough to retire, sell some now and enjoy life while you can sit on the rest and be richer later.

Bill Gates could buy every single Bitcoin and have over 3/4 of his money left.

Bubble or do you guys think it'll last?
@_date: 2017-04-30 18:59:36
Bitcoin is only as secure as its weakest link.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:51:09
So you basically posted just to get donations.
@_date: 2017-04-30 18:58:26
What incoming dump?
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:31:43
You can't predict stuff like that can you?
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:11:42
We need something to happen. Bitcoin has been stagnant for too long and it's losing its dominance because of that.

I can't believe you guys are supporting a guy who did horrible shit that proves how scummy humanity can be. His "marketplace" was used for illegal and evil purposes and it's not like he wasn't involved in any of these illegal activities himself.

Sorry folks, 2001 proves that only terrorists use bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:15:37
I have to respect ViaBTC for their transaction accelerator. Had a transaction sit for a few days since I was trying to empty 25k satoshis out of a wallet with only a 10k satoshi fee. Put it through their accelerator and it confirmed within the hour.
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:50:26
Money laundering is a type of fraud and it's tecchnically theft from the government

No, there's no one in my life I want dead.

I know you're joking but I've tried to buy iTunes gift cards off of Paxful and all of the vendors are Nigerian. And they all try to scam you.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:01:30
Why does he have to "favor" bitcoin? He's telling the truth.
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:24:02
Yes but I'm talking about what it's like now, not in the future. We aren't even close to segwit nonetheless lightning.
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:29:24
Money laundering

Well grocery stores don't have to change their prices every hour.
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:45:30
At the current rate no transaction costs 27 cents.
@_date: 2017-05-07 05:34:17
Try ViaBTC's accelerator.

So you're saying selling drugs is okay online just because it's less violent than in person?

Not if you want to stay anonymous, but otherwise it really doesn't matter.

Needs a dramatic zoom in on the green numbers
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:17:15
I would hold off until you have more than a coin. A Trezor costs more than 100 USD...
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:39:58
Don't know what to say... hopefully no one else is in this equation though.
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:13:18
No addresses can be used infinitely

Stop him from gambling before it's too late.

NYC doesn't facilitate or allow these deals therefore they don't hold responsibility.
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:44:44
Yep, so by increasing your security (not reusing addresses), you increase the cost.
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:01:38
Because the whole idea of a decentralized, unreulated, uncensored, free-from-any-form-of-government bitcoin isn't completely true.
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:02:03
Yep, the ones that have some value like LTC are already bouncing back while scamcoins like XRP are staying down.
@_date: 2017-05-02 23:39:54
Hodl until it pays for your retirement!
@_date: 2017-05-07 05:19:39
Hey at least you can't lose money gambling now. :)
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:23:31
Nice try, government.

Did Core invent C++?
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:09:50
Yea there's still the issue of transaction speed, fees, and limited supply. There's currently no way for everyone to adopt bitcoin.

May 13, 2017
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:13:04
Imagine people owning less than .002 btc and having to pay half that for a transaction fee. That's what's reality is today.
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:05:06
You can't have both decentralization and a strict following of "Satoshi's vision". Following a single person's vision and treating it as authority is centralization by definition.
@_date: 2017-05-10 00:48:31
Litecoin is what Bitcoin could be but isn't. With Segwit it now has a bunch of new features and applications.
@_date: 2017-05-08 20:32:22
Why the hate on "banksters"?
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:32:18
That's what they tried to achieve with communism. Truth is though, you either have politicians or dictators.
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:49:38
Then it went back up again. Seems like it's stabilizing at 1500-1600.

If steam accepts litecoin I'm all in

RIP that one unlucky guy whose cold storage address is generated by someone else.
@_date: 2017-05-07 14:45:00
Adding more nodes and new miners. Once more people become interested in BTC this will happen. As ASIC development slows down other companies will be able to push out cheaper machines capable of the same hashrate. Bitmain won't have as much influence. More people will get involved in coding, etc.
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:19:38
It is true that LTC isn't used for anything right now, but if BTC continues to stay stagnant then people will move to other coins eventually. Large companies/exchanges like Coinbase are adding LTC. Pumping is likely but LTC's ATH hasn't been reached yet.
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:18:24
Any that's why currencies today are inflationary. Governments want people to spend money.
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:05:35
If only I was old enough to know about BTC 8 years ago then I'd be a millionaire today. :)

Well Kim Jong Un was unaninamously elected.
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:03:11
No reason BTC should be going up either with this stalemate. It's all just speculation.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:46:13
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:37:37
I see a bright future ahead with LTC, not sure why it's dropping a few days before activation.
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:26:02
You're a horrible person.
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:21:49
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:13:00
Because they want more people to buy in therefore increasing the price and their profits.
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:25:34
How can it call itself a currency if you can't use it to pay for some things?
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:29:23
That's actually hella good at the $30 price.
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:44:57
Anyone defending him should think about all the people that die and have their lives ruined by drugs. Then think about all the other crap that was listed on his "peaceful website" and how he hired hitmen.
@_date: 2017-05-07 05:30:55
I'm working towards 1.
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:02:20
OP is the reason the price started going up again.
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:21:13
Yep he tried to make the world a more peaceful place...
He deserves the two life sentences just for those attempted murders.
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:14:06
Who the heck cares that much about decentralization if you can't use your BTC? We have to take trade-offs eventually. Decentralization can be achieved through other means.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:20:12
And if they don't know about your illegal income they can't tax it can they? So it's tax evasion too.
@_date: 2017-05-11 00:14:08
Except alts are willing to look at solutions instead if geting locked in a stalemate. Litecoin for example can now handle many times bitcoin's capacity.
@_date: 2017-05-05 00:35:44
That instant drop and steady climb back. It's a rollercoaster!
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:14:43
$2000000! $1000000! $2000000

Far more BTC has been used on the dark net for malicious purposes.

If we survive the 1929 crash.

Darknet = unlisted addresses accessed with Tor
Deepweb = unlisted addresses that look normal that can be accessed with your normal browser

Actually it was 3 since he had to change the hardcoded prices.
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:34:51
By the time everyone adopts LTC everyone will have computers and internet capable of handling large enough blocksizes.
