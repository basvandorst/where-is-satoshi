Sorry about the delay replying to everyone here - we had our eye on all of the comments and it was honestly painful not being able to reply immediately, but we had to confirm some stuff our end first. All sorted now though.
I've answered all question up till this point, but if you've got any questions feel free to post them here, message me direct, or email support

I have no idea who sk33lz is, but I like their style :-)
In all seriousness, I do think what they're saying is true. Competition and innovation is always going to be a good thing for Bitcoin.

At the moment we have a limit of 20 items per order for all price brackets. Hopefully that'll help your grocery shopping a little bit :)
Thanks for the positive words. We're also really excited for the future!

Hey m0l. This issue is on our radar and will be fixed very soon. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-13 17:32:11
Thank you so much for this! We really put all of our effort into the initial development and design. I thought we were in the clear of small mistakes like this.
Thanks again!

Hey DadsBeenDrinking!
I've just posted a reply to this question in the top voted comment, so I won't copy and paste the answer - [here's a link]( Our main advantage at the moment is that we offer cheaper prices throughout the range of order values. We're a team of passionate tech and business-minded folk who are ready to do everything we can to make our service the best. We'll be adding some cool features over the next few days/weeks, so keep an eye out for any updates.
I'm glad you had a nice experience with Bitspend - obviously we wouldn't wish any bad experience on anyone. We would however encourage you to try our lower prices serviced as well, and then you can see for yourself.

The past week has been a great example from you guys of how to launch an internet business - well done!
We really mean it when we say that our presence in this field will serve as a catalyst to innovation and together we can better serve the Bitcoin community.
We've got some cool things up our sleeves - I'm sure you'll be keeping a close eye on us!

Hey ctoacsn. I certainly understand what you're saying and why you've said it - I would be thinking the same if I were in your position.
Personally I that it's difficult to distinguish between any two businesses which are offering such a similar service whilst being launched a week apart. But as time goes by, Bitcoin Runner is going to be adding some truly awesome features. We can only compete with our lower price as of this moment, but please trust me when I see that in the near future we will be offering some very exciting features.

It's definitely an exciting time for Bitcoin as a whole, as well as the field of service that we provide. We're genuinely excited to be one of the businesses innovating in this field!

Hey, thanks for asking this. Obviously this was going to be on a lot of people's minds when they saw this post.
Being in the early stages also, we have not yet fully integrated all of the features we would like. At the moment, our biggest advantage over BitSpend.net is that we have a cheaper pricing system. We charge $2 for orders under $100, and $3 for orders between $100 and $350. Any order larger than $350 has a $5 fee. We're starting out with a max order value of $500, but this limit will soon be increased to something more substantial.
Our team has a lot of experience in tech, business and startups, and we have access more than enough funding to take as many orders as you guys can throw at us.
I'm sure a lot of people will agree with us when we say that a bit of friendly competition really is a good thing for all involved. There's no doubt that BitSpend have done an excellent job with their launch, but we hope to compete with BitSpend  in terms of quality, price, and features. As the two main (only?) competitors in this area at the moment, you can all rest assured that Bitcoin Runner will be adding some very exciting features in the near future.

Hey there Pixelbits. Very good point there - we expected questions like these. I've just made a few other replies on the same subject [here]( and [here]( so I won't write a huge essay in this post.
In a nutshell, we are able to offer the service at a lower price throughout the range of order values.
We're a team of experienced techies and as such we're able to ship new features really fast. We've got some great ideas on how we're going to innovate in this field, so keep an eye out for some new changes.
I'm really looking forward to the future of Bitcoin Runner and seeing how this exciting business grows and develops.
Thanks for the question.

Just a heads up, we launched a similar service a couple of weeks ago. We're called  we let you spend Bitcoins at any online retailer. We take a very small fee, but for the convenience of shopping at any online retailer using Bitcoins, we think it's worth it :-)
