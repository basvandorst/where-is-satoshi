That's the coolest fucking story I ever heard. You're right, Bill Clinton was a pervert, therefore Trump is not a turd.

Yeah I wish I could be a such a "winner" that I paid women for sex, hung out with convicted pedophiles, and made a fake "Time" cover of myself.
Not even the presidential seal can wash the shit off a turd

I know that you're probably dying for an answer, but there isn't one.
All we can do is hope that MtGox is being bought out, and that the new owner(s) will slowly start withdrawals. In my opinion, this is a fairly likely outcome because it is the interest of a lot of people that Bitcoin not gain a reputation with theft and loss. So not all hope is lost.
Take some solace in knowing that at worst, will be able to write-off these losses on your taxes.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:23:21
So what is your point? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:31:08
Listen you pile of trash, I have a screenshot of you posting lies about receiving btc from Mt. Gox less than an hour ago.
I just wanted to let you know that you're an awful human being. Not only could you have fucked someone if they bought coins based on your lies, but think of the people who lost 6 figures on Gox, read your shit post, and got a glimmer of false hope.
You can delete this account and come back new and anonymous. But you better go out and do something really fucking good for someone if you want to wash of the stain from off your own self-perception, otherwise you will always know what a shit person you are.

How do we know this is a widow trying to find bitcoins, and not somebody trying to steal someone's bitcoins?

Well, considering your previous posts, why WOULDNT I trust you as a credible source on China and Weibo without any sort of proof whatsoever? /s
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:13:00
Doesn't this PDF coincide neatly with everything that is happening, especially the fact the top Bitcoin guys are working together to bailout Gox?
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:58:59
So what? If the Merchant wants to reap the benefits of bitcoin, maybe they should accept it.
If Xapo catches on for a certain merchant's customers, maybe it will push the merchant towards accepting bitcoin directly to avoid the fees.

Its easy to forget how quickly things can change in the world of Bitcoin.
In a few months,the trendy comment will be smugly saying "It was obvious that it was going to go up, Microsoft, Paypal, Time, Transactions..."

Weaknesses: "Current slide in reputation...due to banking challenges in Japan."
Would be nice if the banking challenges in Japan were the sole obstacle causing the issue now.
(But I doubt it)

Congratulations, you've successfully de-railed the topic.
Boy, how could anyone see you as a troll?

In the last month, bitcoin has gone from 400 &gt; 700 in a week, then from 600 &gt; 440 in a week.
Every single investment with potential has ups and downs. Want risk-free investment? Go stick your money in a savings account and get $5 a year, while losing $6 in value to inflation.
Otherwise, suck it up, pick an exit point ($600? $1200? Up to you), and get back to life outside of staring at bitcoin prices.

Just checking, but were there 750,000 bit coins on it?

I used bitcoin to buy something on TigerDirect. They canceled my order, but could not refund the money. So I ended up with a gift certificate that to this day, I have not used.
I am a holder, but only because I'm young and I can take bigger risks with my money.

Finally, a clear indication of what happened at Mt. Gox.
Next time, you should engage in a larger marketing campaign for such a huge announcement. Exclusive interviews, magazine ads, short trailers....
Because after all, a shocking announcement that only Mark Karpeles knows what is happening at Mt. Gox...two reddit teaser threads aren't enough.
Are you done promoting your blog yet?

Can you not see front page of r/bitcoin? Its loaded with mtgox discussion.
The op is clearly responding to the oft-repeated statement that the mt gox situation is proof that bitcoin cannot survive.

Can you not type in mtgox.com in your own web browser?

No, because if a new silver mine opens and the market is flooded with silver, the price of silver can drop independently of the dollar.
Conversely, it a new technological/medical use for silver is discovered, then demand could skyrocket and the price of silver could rise independently of the dollar.
You need to show more than just how it relates to silver. It's tough bc real estate and food can also fluctuate, but you need more than just silver.

Sports are there to keep normies bussy. So with a pre show and an after show you keep them busy all night. Pump them full with ads which finance the whole shizzle. And the actual sport preformance is very often pathetic. 
Romans knew how to keep their citizens busy with entertainment too! Unforunately the empire did fall not much after that.

This is nonsense.
"If you are illiquid you are insolvent and trying to create liquidity is only going to worsen the problem"
is the equivalent of saying
"If you have billions in the bank and borrow a $10 bill for lunch because you don't have the cash or ATM nearby, you can't afford $10 for lunch and you're only going to worsen your debt problem"
No. This is why he stated the definitions - you keep trying to change the definition of illiquid to fit your logic.

If you haven't been scammed in Paypal, then you haven't used Paypal for actual business. Paypal is just as vulnerable to scams as Bitcoin is.
