Personally I found this link much more accurate and informative:

Considering your username I'd buy it

No, you aren't. The fact that only 1-3 transactions occur per block *is* it's weakness. If just a couple hundred happened per block, shit would get a lot harder a lot quicker.

That $50 lunch is just that, $50. It's just a different medium of exchange. Either way that $50 is not something you're planning on keeping and investing with, it's money that's going out of your pocket. Again, it's not a question of $50 under the mattress in cash or under the mattress in a flash drive. 
Edit: it's not like you can't get another $50 worth of btc for $50 at the moment, either. With transaction fees, though, i suppose it's more of $52 lunch if you want to use btc...

Great company name

When it's not your home country that's spying on you, people are a lot more concerned
Edit: but you're totally right. In fact if you're an android user, then a couple months ago all it would have taken is a text :)

Because they need to also be buying lunch, either way. Lunch money =/= savings (bitcoin holdings). That lunch is the current market value the pay for, not some savings wallet they're taking money out of for food.

Hey! You could get a NSL to make sure they don't get patched until someone else discovers them and they become a problem!!!

Careful traveling over borders.
Full disk encryption (or even partial) can be illegal in several countries.
China and Russia are known to target and infect devices that go through the border via automated attacks and/or confiscation.
If you are traveling with sensitive information, consider hidden encryption methods, such as veracrypt or encoding data in what would normally be seen as regular media (steganography). Be careful, because not only will you be under penalty of carrying an encrypted device if caught, but you will probably be charged with lying to officials as well. You can not be certain your tracks will be hidden.
