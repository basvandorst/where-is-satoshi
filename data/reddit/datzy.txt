who wants to hold gox centralized unwithdrawable records in a shitty centralized database? goxBTC does not exist on Ripple. bitstampBTC are as good as BTC and can be exchanged instantly for BTC or anything else. when the most reliable, best Bitcoin exchange is on the Ripple protocol - that means something.

ok. well i am going to start a merchanting company where you can buy things and accept XRP for things. XRP seems like it more closely aligns with the dollar and other currencies than BTC does. the fundamental unit has the potential to get to parity with a dollar while psychologically BTC is way over it. my merchanting solution will be instantaneous even on chain and decentralized to any currency, unlike Bitpay or Coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:47:19
Yeah it's hard to know. Part of me wants to believe the BTC is still there and I should invest in goxBTC at a discount and the other part of me says GOX, Bitstamp, and btc-e built in automated "transaction redundancy and robustness" thinking they were being smart using transaction ids.

J.R. the issue here is that you do not have a clear enough plan. Your "protocol layer" is rather vague and too generalized. Generally, a "protocol layer" is open sourced. Where is the niche and market need you will address? Bitmessage/Open Transactions can already accomplish much of what you want. I do not see a clear mission here or the thought processes/patterns necessary to build a company on. You need to refine your thinking and pitch after you have a discernable plan or technology.
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:12:57
Bitcoin was not fully open sourced at its inception. As Satoshi worked on the Bitcoin protocol, his masterwork, he could not afford to have random developers chiming in and ruining perfection (for that period of entropy, that period of time - things have changed). The Ripple team needs to get things as good as they can be before completely open sourcing the code.

Also, Occam's razor is a logical fallacy. The moves people will make in business are insane and for self gain. People will travel around the world to steal.

@_date: 2013-05-08 11:03:57
Also, I could double spend millions very easily, even starting with 100 BTC. I double spend to the U.S. Dollar in a trading house, then I rebuy BTC with the U.S. dollar and repeat this process over and over again. I space out these sells. I actually get exponential returns to BTC as long as I space out the double spends at the right volume and trending of the market. I eat up BTC. Panic ensues when people realize there is a breach. Everyone cashes out or all the trading houses close. I could destroy Bitcoin within the year. The mining guild could destroy Bitcoin. Bitcoin is doomed to become what we fear most: a centralized (mining guild, trading houses, early adopters), fee laced, transaction limited wasteland of hope. Ripple is the answer. (As an early Bitcoin adopter, I can offer an unbiased opinion.)

Not so. Ripple is decentralized and peer-to-peer just like Bitcoin. If OpenCoin is taken down, anyone can continue developing the Ripple protocol and the ledger will survive. The plan is to fully open source the Ripple protocol after the beta. OpenCoin will only hold on to 20% to 30% of XRP. In comparison, Satoshi has mined around 30% of BTC and holds 15%-20%.
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:42:28
1) 
2) XRP were all created in the "genesis block" of Ripple - 100 billion of them as opposed to limit 21 million BTC that will be mined rather inefficiently and expensively I might add (wouldn't those processors better be used for big data and scientific purposes?). The biggest credit card companies transact about 100 billion. Thus, the value of XRP has the most potential to closely align with the approximate value of other stable currencies such as the U.S. dollar.
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:58:24
The point is, as soon as miners bow out, it will take far less than 500 of the world's super computers to reach 51%. Even if you do not double spend millions, faith in the currency will fall, ruining the system for everyone. Regardless if this ever happens or not, processing power is being wasted when better, more efficient protocols exist which require less processing power to maintain. Money and processing power are going into maintaining the Bitcoin protocol which far exceed the value of the protocol as an instantaneous transfer and free money transfer service (regulations such as transaction minimums (54uBTC) spurred by block chain problems with many small transfers affecting speed is one example of the deteriorating value of the Bitcoin protocol)(also, fees on BTC transactions are being implemented due to economic and scalability reasons). Relative inefficiency from a Universal standpoint means one thing; death.
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:55:22
Ripple is more than just the XRP currency. It includes a rather innovative IOU/trust/gateway system which solves many problems with scalability, exchange, debts, and insurance. The Ripple protocol will be adopted by Bitcoiners regardless of XRP. BTC debt alongside XRP means one thing - adoption of XRP and the use of XRP to pay down BTC debts.  
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:27:49
If it scales back, that means less processing power is dedicated to Bitcoin blockchain verification. Relatively, I could throw ten supercomputers at the Bitcoin protocol in from outside the network and achieve the 51% exploit. The whole six block thing and timing is trivial. I can design an algorithm to automate this and double spend millions of BTC. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 13:19:38
Also, in business, never work with anyone who speaks negatively in relative terms about someone else. Never work with someone who brings rent a girls to events. Never work with anyone who uses the terminology "we" in stressed syllable. Never accept money from a celebrity investor. Never fund someone who wants to tell you a "story" i.e. "let me tell you a story" - that is a stolen innovation. The list goes on. All rules I find obvious but the community has ignored. The community has fed monsters. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:29:52
Regardless, in order to deter the 51% attack, processing power will be wasted. We will always see economic inefficiency.

This is only a temporary solution to a much bigger problem. I agree with lucif on that thread: "From one patch to another, Bitcoin becomes what they try to get rid off." This solution limits freedom and defeats the whole purpose of Bitcoin. For any practical purpose in the short term, this solution may work. DDOS-like attacks are still possible on the block chain. This solution will not fix underlying scalability problems. In the long term, I consider this measure an inelegant hack.  
@_date: 2013-05-08 00:56:26
The economy as a whole, not the bitcoin economy. From an efficiency standpoint giving away/selling off XRP is more efficient than mining for BTC. Mining makes the assumption that the BTC economy will scale enough so that mining will aways pay off for the miners or at least break even. The processing power allocated to mining is extreme overkill in terms of adding transactions to the blockchain and this will always be so less the network become vulnerable to the 51% attack. Since BTC allocated by blocks halves down to the limit, and mining becomes progressively harder as more processing power is allocated to the network, the currency must increase in value thousands of times for mining to break even in the future. Once mining becomes unprofitable (it is already near break even) mining will cater off and less processing power will be allocated to the network. This will make it much easier for a body to initiate a 51% attack and fork the blockchain. This is the fatal flaw of Bitcoin. Gross inefficiency and required inefficiency - economic unfeasibility even with technological advances in processing power because control is all relative and shaped by economic forces of profitability.

"The person(s), who Sergio assumes is the one accredited with inventing Bitcoin, has netted 1,814,400 BTC from mining,  1,148,800 of which has never been spent [1].  In today’s exchange rate, that’s about $100 million US dollars. Not bad for inventing your own fortune."
The Bitcoin community should not delude itself into believing BTC cannot be centrally controlled and that Bitcoin itself has not enriched its founder.
Ripple's price is based on its value as a currency. I have read interpretations of the Ripple claiming it is a "postage stamp." This is simply not true. In order for the Ripple protocol to work, Ripple must carry value beyond that of a simple "postage stamp" - it must carry the value of the entire transaction. The brilliance of Ripple is in the robust protocol which allows Ripple to change hands and interfaces with the world's currencies via the built in exchange.
Remember why humans use currency in the first place. It is much easier for me to carry a coin currency in my pocket than three goats and a cow. In today's technological era, currency must evolve to facilitate transactions. A currency which can be transmitted semi-anonymously with no fees instantaneously is much more valuable than a currency which costs 2% a transaction and takes hours or days to change hands in full view of the prying eyes of our neighbors. 
A robust, more stable, scalable currency which speed is not limited by a slowly synchronizing block chain as the currency scales, which is decentralized and stabilized by an authority holding much of that currency, which does not suffer from the 51% processing block chain forking fatal flaw, which possesses a built in exchange and HTTP-like protocol for moving any currency that adds to stability, which provides an incentive system discouraging DDOS-like transactions, which is near instantaneous and scalable holds great value. Ripple is actually more valuable than bitcoin as a currency.

Assuming Moore's Law, yes, Bitcoin will be able to handle more transactions - but still not enough considering the increased adoption (demand for Bitcoin) we need to ensure deflation and continued profitability of mining at the scale required to deter the 51% attack. Believe me, I ran the numbers. We need to rework the entire protocol (it would no longer be Bitcoin, it would be Ripple). The only option for speed later down the line is less nodes: 
Bad news: this would mean centralization of processing power and centralization of the currency. This is already happening with pools. The pools will break up when mining becomes unprofitable resulting in slower speed. It will be much easier for me to beat from a processing standpoint a bunch of clients only geared to accept block headers and waning pools of unprofitable miners. It will also be possible for me to acquisition pools of processing power (nodes) of waning profitabilty in order for me to achieve 51%. Also, catch-22s and intricate balances of power at scale will result in instability.

Throw all the processing power in the world against me - you will waste precious energy, hardware, and produce pollution. By 2018, unless we see massive deflation, you will not get enough coin in return for your processing to cancel out your costs. The incentive to mine will fall and less processing power will be dedicated to the Bitcoin network. It will be more cost effective for me to double spend on the blockchain and achieve exponential returns than to mine with that 51% processing power. This is an unacceptable vulnerability for a world currency.
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:01:46
This model is not sustainable. The blockchain will grow to unworldly proportions, processing power will be wasted, the BTC will have to increase in value dramatically, changing the units of measure down to many decimal places, causing confusion and constant updates.

If OpenCoin flooded the market with all the XRP we would see poor adoption, low prices, and centralization by big spenders who could buy all the XRP cheaply. OpenCoin must do phased giveaways and then sell XRP so the value of other currencies will be transferred to XRP - just as the value of processing power (which costs money) in the Bitcoin protocol is transferred to BTC (loosely on both counts). Granted mining is a great marketing strategy, the process is horribly inefficient and is burdening our economy. XRP is only as valuable as its utility and technological capacity as a currency. XRP already holds some intrinsic value because a small fraction of XRP is required to use much needed features of the Ripple protocol.
