No limit on credit card purchases.
No limits on tourists.

No they won't ban you, what a ludicrous statement.
@_date: 2015-06-28 09:06:08
Nope, it's indeed a ridiculous idea.

PayPal works great here.  What is this %11 fee you guys keep talking about?
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:55:30
I don't.
%99.99999 of the folks here don't even know what Bitcoin is.
Many people here haven't even sent an email..
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:13:48
Thank you sooo much.  I like this little tip system.......
you're my second tipper ever!!!
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:10:50
They don't use Bitcoin, I promise.  They just use a payment processor that converts Bitcoin and deposits cold hard cash into their bank account for a fee (just like Paypal and credit cards do).
Again, they don't accept Bitcoin...they accept dollars converted by a processor for a fee.  This is just a marketing ploy will more than likely affect less than 0.1% of all of their transactions.
If they were collecting and spending Bitcoin to pay their expenses then that would be really great news.  They aren't, which makes this non-news.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:54:52
I own a little bit. But its current *practical* usage is virtually and perhaps unfortunately, non existent.
Ohh and Bitcoin is not free, far from it. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 10:57:48
I was able to take €40 from my Bulgarian account and I can take as much as I need from my Canadian account. 
I bought a tank of diesel with my Canadian visa last night with no issues.
Edit- Greeks can take €60 per day till next week. 
Regular CC transactions (where available) continue to work. PayPal and Google Wallet work gloriously (my wife gets paid with PayPal). 
@_date: 2015-06-29 09:15:51
Cheers from Peraia, Greece as I wait in line at an ATM.
In a country where a huge % have yet to send an email, people need cash not invisible money. 
...shit, try to find a restaurant that will accept my Visa card... Nope. 
It's all cash here for many obvious and not some obvious reasons. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:41:46
I had no idea Greeks had German bank accounts.
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:48:22
You are right.  Not sure why you were downvoted.
@_date: 2015-06-29 16:51:09
Nearly free yes (%1 or %2 transaction fees are cheap).
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:39:30
I used a bank transfer when I bought my condo in Bulgaria.  I transferred money from Canada to Bulgaria and it was under $50.
Yes, for the whole purchase price of the property and it only took 2 days (the fee also included opening a new account in BG, new credit card and 2 bank cards).
Monthly bank fees here at 77 cents/month + 50 cents if I take money out of a 'weird' ATM machine.  Online banking is also free, although the Android app sucks-ass.
I think it's a pretty good deal considering the amount security and recourse.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:11:17
I'm sorry, I don't understand your question. 
Yes, banking is not free, they are for profit businesses...just like Bitcoin payment processors are. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:58:22
My bank account has no limits as I'm not Greek. I can take out as much as I want. 
Greeks only have access to €60/day. Bitcoin would have no benefit here as no one accepts it. It's hard to find a business accepting credit cards, in case you're curious.
Edit. This is just my stupid assumption but I think that out of one million Greeks, about 50 of them would even know what Bitcoin is (let alone have any BTC) 
@_date: 2015-06-30 08:11:11
That is something I knew nothing about.  thanx.
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:24:54
Reality is pretty much opposite of this. Ugh, you people. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 14:41:34
Of course not. I have a feeling about 150 Greeks even know about bitcoin. 
When it comes to reality, this sub is dumb. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:54:13

Totally agree.  Time will tell.

I really don't think they see Bitcoin as a threat. Ugh. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:09:45
Yep. If I was Greek I would have dumped all my funds into PayPal. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 08:25:38
I don't believe they really are accepting Bitcoin at all.  From what I can tell they're just accepting a Bitcoin payment processor that deposits dollars into their bank account for a service fee. 
So yeah, nothing to see here, unfortunately. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:22:34
Then do what with them?
I guess I could brag about my purchase on Reddit.  
Will I be able to use Bitcoin to fill my campervan with diesel or buy myself a bowl of tripe soup? Not a chance.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:26:24
Make "shady" guys richer, as the bitcoin platform has been doing since its inception. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 12:52:35
Sure, but I can covert it to paper for free* at the 100 ATM machines that are nearby.
*I pay 77 cents/month 
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:47:34
Yes, I can take out as much as I want as I am not Greek.
I can use my Canadian or Bulgarian cards with no limits at any ATM in Greece.
If I was Greek I would have dumped all my money into my PayPal account..and just waited. (it's not like a bank account yields any interest anyway).
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:21:05
Selling Euros for what?
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:51:01
I am sure they would accept burnt toast if someone would buy their toast and convert it to USD.
Not sure what you're getting at here.  To me "accepting Bitcoin" should also be "spending Bitcoin".  In this case they are accepting USD through a payment processor that charges a fee. yawn.
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:41:27
Most of the population here have never even used a smartphone, let alone owned one. Many people don't even use email.

Why don't they use bank transfers? 
How would Bitcoin help them? 
@_date: 2015-05-18 15:23:46
In the end you're still going to use a payment processor to move your bitcoin into your bank account so you can buy beer, pay your mortgage, diesel for your car, or buy your girlfriend flowers. 
I tried to buy bitcoin once, they asked for a 5 day waiting period and a scan of my passport (along with way more info than my bank ever wanted). 
Frigh.. even the Bitcoin ATM asks me for 2 pieces of ID and my thumb.

You could have used PayPal for free. Use the "family and friends" method. My wife and I were in Hoi An last year and used this completely trouble free when transferring money from our friend's account in Canada.

Fries at Fibo are glorious, comeon.? 
And yes, point was intentionally missed. 
@_date: 2015-05-18 14:54:16
Your idea requires the receiver to use Bitcoin which is %0 of the population, especially in Europe. 
It would be easier to use PayPal. Email address, done, nothing else needed. You would also have a record and recourse if something went astray. 
Unless you're dealing with reputable companies, paying with bitcoin is like throwing money into a big toilet, flushing then hoping for a positive outcome. 
When will this sub become less bitcoin-religious and more bitcoin-realistic? 
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:53:18

Microsoft *does not* accept Bitcoin. They work with a currency processor that automatically converts bitcoin to money. 
They would accept slices of stale bread if they could find someone to convert those slices to dollars. 
If you guys think that Microsoft has a bitcoin wallet filled with Bitcoins they're just waiting to spend or invest, you're delusional.

EDIT: I don't understand the downvotes.  How is made up money....money?  I would much rather have $10,000 in my PayPal account (that I can do whatever the hell I want with) than $10,000 'worth' of Bitcoin in a wallet .  Am I missing something here?
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:19:57
Why not just become responsible with your finances? 
Just keep $20 in your account at all times and you will never, ever have that problem. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:27:00
Sure. But with my $10,000 in cash I can (if I wanted to) buy that many bitcoins. 
I could also pay my rent, buy a case of fine wine at my local liquor store.... I could buy whatever I fucking want instead of searching for a merchant that accepts bitcoin or a payment processor to exchange my money into $. 
Bitcoin is an unstable version of AirMiles. I'm a huge supporter of cryptocurrencies but if you prefer them to cash in your pocket (or your bank account), you're a lunatic. 
@_date: 2015-05-18 15:40:08

There are still lineups at the ATMs and the Greeks are only allowed to take out 60€.  They need to buy food and beer.

PayPal itself is not a currency, it's a service. It's used for electronic transactions and tied to whatever currency that's dear to you. It works really well, especially when you're traveling and working abroad. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 15:52:41
I am behind neither and I have used it in 33 countries without issues for years. (with multiple banks and cards and currencies).
Just logged into my Canadian account from the Black Sea coast in Bulgaria (where I am sitting at this moment) with zero issues.  I will try next week from Malmo, Sweden. Bet you a bitcoin it will work just fine? Deal?
[edit] Ohh..and dipshit, you know they are just protecting themselves by not accepting payments FROM VPN/DNS providers, right??  Nothing wrong with that, I would rather conduct anonymous transactions with Bitcoin anyway (I use a SmartDNS service from the Netherlands for my Torrents, paid with BT).

Of course, you are %100 correct but it would just be easier to deal with if it was a buck....then we wouldn't have to deal with all the fractions and bits and pieces.
It's just in my head...but perhaps it would become more 'subconsciously accessible' to everyone if the price would stabilize in the single digits.
I dunno...
@_date: 2015-04-27 06:27:42

@_date: 2015-04-21 14:06:21
Greeks aren't stupid, they can take out their Euros and stick them in their socks and flower pots.  Why would they buy Bitcoin?? You make no sense.
It's declining in value and can't be used to purchase ANYTHING in Greece.  I've been there many times, they will accept pairs of used pants as payment over Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:56:07
Why not just accept beach sand? If you could have someone eager enough to convert beach sand to US dollars....then you might as well.
To me, someone who accepts Bitcoin is someone who actually uses the currency, not just adds a Bitcoin link on their website to look 'cool'.
When I accept Paypal....I only accept security and ease of transaction the service provides....Paypal doesn't have any other value to me, the USD that it deposits into my bank account does.
@_date: 2015-04-26 23:26:09
Unless you're hording Bitcoins, why is their value vs USD so incredibly important here?  It's all you guys talk about it.
@_date: 2015-04-27 10:02:24
But it will be heavily devalued.  From a financial perspective this doesn't make any sense to me.  I just don't get it, I don't get it at all.
@_date: 2015-04-13 16:21:30
You are wrong, I know for a fact they don't use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-21 12:59:30
I know that most people are using Bitcoin as an investment vehicle but wouldn't it be awesome if it went back down to $10 or even $1 for us regular folks who just want to use it as a digital currency.
Wouldn't it make it easier?
PS.  I've been to Greece many times and believe me....%99.999 of the people there don't even know what Bitcoin is.  Bitcoin's price will have zero effect on what's happening in Greece...and I doubt there was any correlation between what happened in Cyprus vs Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-13 16:44:15
None of them.
They use a payment processor that converts Bitcoin to USD, I know this for a fact, you can Google it yourself.
..therefore they DON'T use Bitcoin for absolutely anything.
@_date: 2015-04-13 13:42:56
They will accept a Bitcoin payment processor that will in turn send them dollars (for a fee).
Can someone enlighten me? Is there a company that sells goods in the US that ACTUALLY accepts Bitcoin today? Just curious (I'm obviously talking about businesses that don't instantly convert it to their local currency but businesses that truly take BT).

@_date: 2015-04-26 20:08:43
I still don't get it. 
Are bitcoins a investment vehicle?
Are bitcoins a currency? 
If you use them as currency then keep spending, buying and selling and stop worrying about daily fluctuations, keep your balance low or at zero. If you're using them as some type of a (shady or otherwise) investment then you're doing it wrong. 
I dunno.

They're not accepting Bitcoin, they've simply signed up with a Bitcoin payment processor. What ends up in their bank accounts is cold hard Zloty. 
Just as with credit cards but with higher transition fees.

@_date: 2015-02-18 13:11:40
The Bitcoin payment processor transaction fees are much higher than PayPal and CC and if you think you can get a phone anonymously using Bitcoin, you are dreaming.   
Them giving back %20 is just a bonus.  Cell phone top-ups cost most telecom companies %10-%20 on the dollar....they're a massive money maker, almost pure profit.
Even though I doubt more than %1 of their top-up transactions will be in Bitcoin, it is obviously a brilliant marketing strategy...choo choo.
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:01:17
Bitcoin for security and ease of use?  No I don't pay any fees on my card, zero.  The merchant pays the cc fees.  I have a feeling when accepting a Bitcoin processor, a company pays fees just as big as when accepting a cc.  Again, they're accepting Bitcoin because it's the 'cool' thing to do and for marketing purposes, not for any other reason.
Who doesn't want protection on their purchases?? That's just crazy, I would never send money to someone I don't know, anonymously without having any type of recourse (cc, paypal etc).
Just a head's up....Bitcoin isn't a religion, many of you people here are treating it as such and that's very creepy. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:14:49
No. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:11:23
It's the first thing that comes to my head...that and a speculative 'stock' that people hope to earn money from (it's rise and fall).
Anonymous transaction of funds is Bitcoin's  allure, it's the reason why it's being predominantly used for illicit purposes.
...not that there is anything wrong with that.
@_date: 2015-03-23 14:18:58
Bitcoin has become a bit like religion. Very smart people (let's call them pastors) are laughing all the way to bank exploiting their little gullible sheep. 
This is nothing more than a well orchestrated ponzi scheme. Can't believe so many of you are still supporting this sham. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:32:54
I always find it funny when everyone gets excited about 'so and so is accepting Bitcoin'.
In 99% of the cases they are NOT accepting Bitcoin, they're accepting money (that is converted from Bitcoin by a payment processor).  I've said this before, any business will be happy to accept buttered toast if there is a third party that will convert buttered toast into equivalent currency. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:44:56
Bitpay is just like PayPal except without any security.  They just convert one form of payment into another.
I don't understand why people get all excited when a big company announces that they accept Bitcoins.  It goes against everything that Bitcoin stands, it's anonymity. 
Why would one use Bitcoin to buy something from...say Microsoft?? Makes no sense, just use your credit card, it's not like you have to pay any fees..and with a CC you may get extra warranty, ability to chargeback, points...etc.

They really don't 'accept' bitcoin, they don't ever see or touch one during the transaction.  They more than likely don't even have a wallet.
They do this for marketing only and not for any other reason.
