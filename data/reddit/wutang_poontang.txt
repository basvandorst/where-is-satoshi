Wow. So vicious. 
I can tell you are a true oracle as you chose to not pick rather than counter. 
You don't think there is a "1%er" group in bit coin?  Explain to me what happens when the people hording 99% of bit coin sell. What happens then?  Is that the point where the value jumps from $6k to $100k?
Can't wait to learn from you, oh wise one.

Uh....,what?  I suggest you check out the volatility of BTC because you are obviously clueless 
BTW, what makes BTC valuable? Your hated "God-currency."  If BTC was worth a damn, it would need to be hedged against a real currency. 
Don't get me wrong. It's a nice little experiment. But all you dummies shelling out $5k for one of these will be wiping your ass with it in 5 years.

I don't see it. The only reason bit coin is valuable is because people are hording them.

Ok. But no one wants Bitcoin (relative to actual money). And that's not gonna Change. 
There are more than enough Bitcoin for people. Especially when the hoarders sell. Enjoy your little play money experiment while it lasts.

Sorry but you sound overly optimistic and naive. 
It's nothing more than a commodity. I can't go buy gas with it. I can't buy a car with it. I can't buy groceries or movie tickets with it. 
All I can do is trade it with other speculators then cash it out to dollars when I want real money. 
It's a total joke and some very smart people are getting very rich off idiots.

Lolololol. Nope. You have to change it to dollars first. Hahah. Pretty funny you don't even know how it works. 


huh? That's the farthest from the truth. How much Bitcoin does one dollar get? .00000000012. Yeah. Totally simply divisions. 
You're a delusional sheep

Haha. Did you read that on the inside of a Snapple bottle? ��

You need to do some research on the stock market. 
If a small percentage of people hold a large percentage of a commodity, it is not good.
