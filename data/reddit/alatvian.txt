API?  To which TLA are you referring?  Application Programmers Interface?  That's entirely different than a console, like a bash prompt or an old-school VAX console.

I stand corrected.  A bit is 0.000001 BTC.  555 bits @_date: 2014-11-13 04:42:45
I replied to the wrong post.  I'll try again.  555 bits @_date: 2014-11-13 04:11:37
Yes, but ChangeTip uses milli-BTC, not bits.

Anyone who gives tips will receive access to the share trading platform.  I am using shares in 6th Street Radio to help fund development in the software for the radio platform.

I guess the various fees ate some coin.  Let's try sending 554 bits @_date: 2014-11-13 04:22:19
Speaking as a 36-year-old family guy, that's a Bad Idea.  It's akin to putting retirement funds in a single stock.  Any single stock can and will fail.  BTC could go to zero tomorrow, even if the idea of digital currency survives (which I believe it will).  Any money in BTC or in single stocks should be treated as casino cash, i.e. if you lose it all, it hurts, but it doesn't wipe you out.

What crazy lunatic puts "retirement investment" in bitcoin?

IMO the true value of bitcoin is about $10....   So no.  BTC is the future, but not at these hyper-inflated prices.

Is a "bit" a milli-BTC?  I, of course, like the idea of micro-payments, but the difference between mBTC and uBTC is confusing.
