I don't understand your point here.

USD is used by billion people across the world. What would be the energy cost of BTC in the same mass adoption scenario?

I think Elon Musk does not sleep enough and starts to act a bit crazy. He seems he does not care anymore. Scary.

I'd say 12K is more likely, but happy to be proven wrong!

Crypto is all about predictions. Not sure what's wrong with that. You're free to give yours :)

Bitcoin technology can be regularly updated to avoid any attack from quantum computers. BTW, why do you think it did not happen yet, if it's so likely?
@_date: 2019-02-06 11:10:12
I like it :D
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:32:15
Sure, stats provided by Google. Pure FOMO…
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:38:44
crypto will only be successful if it reaches mass market. The rest is a myth.
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:19:39
well, still, it hurts
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:57:21
get a life.

The permission is not required. 
"It was first reported that the authorization of sale came directly from the Banque de France (Bank of France). However, the Bank came forward and clarified that it was actually the National Federation of Tobacco Vendors which gave the green light — and The Bank of France does not have the power to veto it."

I'm French and following that topic in the news. The bank run was promoted by "fly rider" (Maxime Nicolle), one of the biggest leaders of the gilets jaunes. One of the articles covering it:

Yeah I do remember, something like 10 years ago

Google Trend for "Bitcoin" has often been correlated with its price, sometimes anticipating variations. This is not FUD, this is a fact, that is to say the correlation of million searches.

Have you heard about the "gilet jaune coin"? 
@_date: 2019-01-11 21:01:48

I don't see any figure for France. Moreover it's estimated that the system would collapse with an attempt to withdraw around 20% of the funds. This won't happen this weekend but it's not something that could NEVER happen

He has 161k fans on his Facebook group. Again he is highly respected and listened, like Eric Drouet. Your arguments are pure blabla based on nothing, except that you seem to hate this guy. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:07:22
He is a leader of the movement there is no debate here. He is everywhere in the news. I don't understand what you are trying to do here. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 19:44:56
It's your analysis to say all the people in the streets are people with no money. Lots of them are middle class. It's not only a movement of poor people. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:25:30
better to laugh about it. And you don't lose anything as long as you don't sell. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:17:47
This would be the biggest physical network accepting Bitcoin ever. And it's a worldwide chain. A true leap forward.
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:22:27
@_date: 2019-09-24 13:56:48
why so?
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:02:07
you wish ��
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:12:10
Bitcoin is definitely NOT digital gold so far, but it might become in the future, as its price will hopefully stabilizes
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:56:07
We have no choice but to believe.
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:00:00
what a load of bullshit.
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:24:33
We might finally have the mass crypto adoption we have been looking for.
@_date: 2018-12-05 08:19:28
if money and states are separated, nations might disappear. Maybe that's what decentralization is all about ultimately…
@_date: 2018-12-05 08:18:50
why only small? IMF's head (Christine Lagarde) advised all central banks to have a look at crypto.
@_date: 2018-12-12 08:27:47
Maybe educate your heirs on how to deal with cryptocurrency?
