You get it that paying a high(er) fee doesn't make a block bigger?

This is like using unix sendmail and saying "I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of smtp mail will ever be a good idea".  
@_date: 2016-11-24 20:42:59
But you know what an [analogy]( is, don't you?  
The "consensus" for smtp is defined in RFC 821 and it's ~~successors~~ forks.

So you're talking about billions of users, but at the same time you aren't able to properly serve the waiting 50k (or so) users?  
Then you're denying Satoshi's vision of a peer2peer cash system by saying you don't want TX below $1000.  
And finally you're telling people to use off-chain solutions, which a) don't exist today, b) aren't trustless and c) are (as planned today) in no way better than just using your visa card.  
Fail. With this people will just use another blockchain (aka altcoin), which is willing to adjust to people's needs.

Yes, exactly. You can do 2MB or 8MB blocks today without changing more than a single constant in Bitcoin. No difficulties with tech from 2016, promised. This could accommodate the waiting 50k and probably up to 100k or 200k new users also.  
With this you have time to think about how to do further scaling properly. Meaning in line with Satoshi's vision, permissionless, trustless without shady 3rd party "banks" involved.  
I can't tell you today if these solution will include payment channels, subchain(s), parallel blocks or anything else. But I'm sure this should be discussed openly and certainly without the time pressure because of (more than) full blocks...

Seems you really don't get it.  
I'll try it the eli5 way for you: You say, I should just pay "enough" fee. So let's assume after doing the maths you suggest fee X to me.   
Now I happen to be just a normal Bitcoin user, in no way special. So to be just and honest, you should suggest fee X to all other 20k, 30k or 50k Bitcoin users trying to do a TX, too, right?  
Unfortunately even this doesn't make your 1MB block any bigger. Assuming an average TX size of 500b, you told 2000 people the right fee, but gave a wrong fee to 18k or more people.  
So, now try to think really hard and tell me what you did wrong and how you want to avoid telling the huge majority of users the wrong fee.

You must literally be the last user believing this shit. Nobody uses segwit. But you can have fast and cheap transactions today with bigger blocks.
@_date: 2016-05-17 21:09:58
This is a well thought, quite sophisticated argument, yes :)  
You just missed that there is no 1MB blocksize limit in the Satoshi whitepaper, nor in the original client. It was implemented as a temporary fix, and as such it is long overdue to be removed.

Constantly full blocks and &gt; 10MB (one and a half hours) backlog are hurting both Bitcoin reputation and Bitcoin price.
@_date: 2016-05-17 09:09:36
First, this is an interesting profit calculation. I conclude, you got the two S7 for free :)  
Second, you're right, normally supply&amp;demand should make the price go up to compensate for the less generated coins. But in difference to the last halving, there are a lot more coins already in circulation this time. So the percentage of "missing new coins in the whole pot" is quite smaller than 2011. Which should make the impact on price smaller, too.  
Third, and most important IMHO: A higher price needs more demand and "main street usage" to be sustainable. This implies more transactions. Which is completely impossible at the moment, as blocks are already at their artificial 1MB limit.  
So yes, bloodbath mostly...

That makes it one DAO ahead compared to Bitcoin in it's early days.

You probably noticed that the price repeatedly refused to go up. Despite lots of crypto news in mainstream media. Despite halving in some weeks. Despite large increases in marketcap for some-other-coins.  
And you're missing the point that paying the correct fee doesn't make more space for more transactions. It will simply cause sombody else's TX to be delayed.  
Plus, finding the correct fee is an increasingly annoying process no normal user will do. He will simply notice hours of confirmation time and next time use some-other-coin.  
Finally, would be interesting how you separate "genuine" transactions from spam transactions. I have only one or two transactions per day, so I certainly could consider 99.9% of all daily transactions spam, couldn't I? ;)
