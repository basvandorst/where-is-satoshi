It's not remotely ironic. Medium sponsors real journalists, but [doesn't give them nearly enough]( for their freelancers to make a living. So if Butterfield's not full-time staff at a news organization, and he's writing good stuff but can't make a living at it, why can't he be upfront about accepting tips? How else would he be able to keep writing?
The reason why 99 Bitcoins et. al are unstrustworthy isn't just because they accept paid articles, it's because they're not upfront about that policy. Butterfield is upfront. End of story.

Really bad idea. No disagreement there.
You asked if people really remember gimmicky bowl game sponsors, and I responded: Yes, if it's a team they follow.

Author of the story here. Yes, if it's your team, you'll remember. It's not even a question. As I wrote about when I attended the actual Bitcoin Bowl, my Marshall Thundering Herd played four years ago in the Beef O'Brady's Bowl, even though I had no idea what a Beef O'Brady's was. So the next time I saw one, I had to try it. It was awful, but the sponsorship worked.
Besides, people not caring about the sponsor the following year isn't exactly the point. It's that a year ago, there was a huge initiative, the start of a three-year deal. But after that initial game, there's hardly any trace it was there.
