until you send someone some, right? like it is meant to be used (ie be used as currency)
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:21:14
Maybe because only recently BTC transaction times and fees have gone past "useable currency" levels
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:22:16
uhm what news
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:23:11
Because the vast majority of people don't give a fuck about anything but the price / usability 
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:18:02
not the same, as the average user COULD choose without changing anything.
Plus, that would probably cost money - which doesnt happen with things like XRB
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:22:09
Can't you view someones balances if they send you money?
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:05:25
The problem is, you can now choose between waiting two weeks to download that southpark movie and paying a lot or waiting a couple seconds and paying nothing.
And anyone would rather have the movie in seconds for free than to pay a lot and have it in 2 weeks

As a young teen do you think it's a good idea for me to invest in BTC? I am already familiar with it as I trade with it, but I've never invested. Something like buying  100$ or so or more?
@_date: 2017-02-21 22:35:55
What do you trade? Just like buy low sell high? Or trade for other crypto currencies?
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:11:42
thanks sherlock

!remindme 1 year bitcoin price, 3800 rn. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:27:52
It makes perfect sense..stop being a killjoy 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:37:49
Hey I'll pay 0.9 BTC for that 1 BTC 
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:39:48
What if I don't have a non networked PC?
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:57:56
What websites do you recommend? Also, how do you then access the wallet to see if you actually sent the BTC correctly and if it all works fine?
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:00:33
He did the best thing..It might now rise even more and never go lower than 4k. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:06:49
What should I buy BTC or bch
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:07:20
Too late.... It's easier for th general public
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:35:47
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:52:13
Okay thanks a tonne for all this info btw.  
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:11:03
3200$ now on bittrex
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:45:10
Yes, but the meme is referring to the fact that you won't **NEED**  to trade it to buy things. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:03:09
You can buy BTC then use shapeshift to get other cryptos
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:33:50
Didn't the currency give it away..?
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:21:37
Buy all you can afford to lose then hold it forever 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:24:03
Nonono, the price is never going to recover, SELL IT ALL to meeee
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:32:30
A couple nice gaming rigs + games and peripherals
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:53:53
This. Just use ltc or bcc or whatever 
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:46:00
If it becomes a normal currency you can just buy what you want with it without trading it for $ or whatever to buy shite. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:26:34
This. It shouldn't be this hard to buy. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:06:05
Serious question -is this going to help maker mining more profitable? Because right now mining BCH is way more profitable and the value is sky rocketing.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:44:39
I couldnt use coinbase as I live in a different country than of where my passport is and coinmama worked for me
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:32:24
 Why not just buy the bitcoins yourself? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:41:09
coinmama worked for me but had kinda expensive prices
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:52:46
Purely luck. It could have kept rising. He did the right thing. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:54:54
It does as it will be used more widely than it is now, it's just a meme. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 00:01:37
Pretty much what I thought. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:41:52
IOTA for every day transactions, BTC for store of value 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:17:47


Stopped reading right there 
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:38:00
Yeah. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:38:30
IOTA. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:47:39
Dude it's in the whitepaper. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:23:38
Each rasberry pi will make at most 2 cents a day...so it's a completely pointless project if you are doing this for money
@_date: 2017-09-03 12:47:55
Estimates. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:26:20
Hahhaha his twitter is full of this: 
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:46:01
No, this is patrick
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:25:12
Lol pure bs
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:23:46
At my school, if I ask around probs about 50% have heard the name but know nothing about it and from that 50% around 3% maybe owns some or is interested in Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:45:29
Don't forget the current star alignment 
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:00:51
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:38:11
Ah, I only got into crypto a few months ago and I haven't sold anything for fiat
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:27:48
Wrong. Every single person who either miner or bought bitcoin since January 2017 and hasn't sold to this date.
Now that is a "few". 
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:02:30
Got it, and from that I need to save the "privkey bit"? the string of numbers and letters?
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:10:33
RemindMe! 3 years "You bought a Caramel Latte Frappuccino for 0.0008 BTC ($4.38) on 15th October 2017"
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:13:59
How do u get your bitcoin private key from their wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:47:47
The problem is the horrible rates 
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:57:50
haha thanks so much though, I sent a (other) message to support
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:35:57
Hey, thanks, what do I do with this? Thanks so much though &lt;3
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:19:14
it's been 2 days, still got nothing on my wallet + it's not in my withdrawal history and it sais I have no balance, but your tip is still there...wtf? I sent a message to support but they responded with some BS that it went "too quick"
@_date: 2016-07-02 12:34:25
Thanks, I'll try out coinbase, and I have a wallet on my PC, do you think this is good or risky or what? or should I have a online wallet
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:33:18
I currently just have my own wallet on my PC, I have less than 200$ there so idk much where it is
@_date: 2016-07-03 10:31:10
lol, I just want to make sure
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:47:48

@_date: 2016-07-03 10:32:04
? I already have a wallet on my PC, do you think I should get one online or stay with the one on my PC.
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:02:42
Well, they weren't gonna set up a ATM for no return...
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:43:36
Yeah, I tried coinbase but I gave up after all that shit you have to put
@_date: 2016-07-03 10:32:00
? I already have a wallet on my PC, do you think I should get one online or stay with the one on my PC.
