£68 when I bought a week ago from their website. Even after paying for express shipping, it was around $100 (after conversion to usd) which was cheaper than Amazon prices and instead of dealing with a reseller, I got my nano s from the makers themselves.

Still waiting on gemini to verify me :( otherwise I'd have nothing to do with Coinbase anymore (not that I can buy anything through them anyways rn... Plus they're fucking me over).
Can't wait for a viable alternative to Coinbase.

Still cheaper than Amazon with prime shipping.

what about people that trade and gain value to pay off debts? I mean, I didn't start out with a huge investment, but I was able to make 6x my initial investment in 3ish months (largest chunk yesterday). I celebrated by selling off enough coin to pay off *all* my credit card debt today; luckily before the big ltc dip. If I had just paid off debts first, I would still have over 5k in debt tonight.
Now that I have that gone, I'm planning on trading and working on paying off my student loan debt. I still won't invest a lot (probably at most 10% of my paycheck), but to me, it makes more sense to make my investment work for me to climb me out of my debt hole.
Granted, I got extremely lucky in the last 48 hours.

Yup bought at 1250. Barely a few hours and I awoke to 1100. Glad I at least put it into burst coin before this. Now I could get an additional .12 BTC if I reversed. Not gonna do that just yet tho.

I’m saddened that gdax has lower fees but is still coinbase. I can use coinbase in my state but gdax is barred from operating in my state for whatever reason :(

I'd buy again at that price. Or let me be clear, I could maybe afford to buy a BTC at that price instead of nickel and diming my way up.

True. I guess I'm just kicking myself for selling all my crypto a couple months back before the boom. So part of me is just bummed at the idea of buying at 3x the cost I bought then. 
But I still chip in 50 bux here and there and spread it out through other coins.
