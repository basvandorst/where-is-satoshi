I argue that past experience only gives you a small step up in such a market.
7 years is not enough data to give anyone the authority to be able to predict anything. As such I trust a PhD as equally as a coder who taught himself in regards to crypto.
In 10 years we should have enough data to make accurate assumptions

That argument holds no basis here.

So why wouldn't people take advantage of the "cheap times" to open channels?
This would lead to less fluctuation and lower fees overall as people slowly exhibit downward pressure on feel prices by moving more and more to LN channels as they open up during "fee market dips" or whatever you call it
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:01:34
As a malicious actor I wouldn't try to out-shout the existing nodes, as you've pointed out.
It would be much easier to DDOS the nodes, especially if they are in only a handful of AWS servers,  and stop all TX from happening, which is still a weak point.
Both miners and nodes are required, but only one is financially incentivized

It's an unregulated asset class that is not bound by Nations or City-states, and has a property of negative inflation. It's also backed by math, not guarantees from a political entity.
Which other asset class is exactly like this? Please inform me so I can also go invest in it.
I don't care if I'm right, but holding onto old ideologies and attempting to blueprint them on to new ones is just the 2017 version of tilting at windmills.

Nah, his professor admitted he didn't do any research and knows nothing about it.
You can stop listening  to the professor at the end of that sentence. Why would you take advice from someone who did no research? For any situation ?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:25:25
Wont regulate, or cant?
Bitcoin does not have anyone to make these choices. Its set the way it is. The cap will not change. Your argument here is flawed.
I didn't say it was deflationary, it possesses *negative inflation*
Bonds are not backed by math. A computer does not cryptographically verify that a bond is real, don't be obtuse.

@_date: 2017-12-13 16:00:03
All traditional asset classes are regulated in some sense, we can agree on this fact?
Which means that natural human reactions are held in check in known, quantifiable ways that can be taken into account and planned around. Are we still in agreement?
Now, remove all checks and balances on human reaction and emotion. There is no recourse for bad actors, and no reward for good actors. Would you still say that the knowledge of how to work the previous system is transferable to this new system?
No, that is not possible. Is his professor jumping in at the beginning  with absolutely no useful knowledge? No. But you can't transpose one to the other. They are different systems.

You sound like a protestant arguing that Catholicism is wrong
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:25:37
So he's totally experienced with a new asset class that's only existed for 7 years, and he's got insider knowledge about a fully unregulated  system?
Come on does that argument even seem valid? 
The professors prior experience  has little bearing here , due to the fact it's a new asset class that doesn't behave like any traditional asset class. Therefore by the transitive property, his experience is worth about as much as a "gut feeling "

I emailed them back early last year working for a dispensary in California and they basically said the same thing.
They are based in Georgia which does not have any laws of the type, and so I see their concerns that they would invoke the Interstate Commerce Clause in dealing with any out of state drug transactions. It sucks. 
Coinbase in theory could operate for California dispensaries without crossing federal restrictions. Colorado would need some sort of in-state processor as well
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:58:15

Gold has value because of it's rarity and difficulty in mining it. (The two are intrinsically tied).
In fact everything of value acts this way except paper money.
Oil's value is tied to how difficult it is to harvest and create a final product. Hence why when shale oil (easier to mine/refine) happened the price went down. The Saudis then tried to subsidize the price even lower to drive shale oil out of the market, which is where we are today.

The tax issue we face is merely calculating sales tax paid to various counties. If we were able to take bitcoin online prior to delivery, we would be able to pay sales tax to SF only, rather than several different counties. It would simplify the books!

the issue is not getting bitcoins into the dispensary, but rather getting the customer base to acquire and spend bitcoins at said dispensary.
I'm located in SF and work for a dispensary, but the real issue is who would use BTC with us? We operate as a delivery service only at the moment, and I can see how it would help us out, but the customer base for this industry is realistically not very tech savvy. 
Also, none of our suppliers are going to take digital currency when they need to operate on a cash basis (for the most part).
edit: Also, there is no issue in accepting BTC for cannabis, as long as you are a legal patient in said state. Its still an industry where a face to face meetup is necessary for safety and security reasons.

I work for a medical marijuana dispensary in SF. I am on my boss 24/7 about bitcoins. We are very close, and hopefully next week I will break through to him. We need a supportive customer base honestly. Been in the business 9 years now, and having a $2.00 fee per transaction as well as having to accept transactions within the county have been very hard on us. We can't deliver outside of SF because of antiquated tax codes! Bitcoin would circumvent these in an acceptable, legal way!
@_date: 2013-05-02 07:02:18
I'm surprised more places around here(SF) don't take it yet.

It takes literally 6-8 days for money to go from my bank account to somebody elses actual bank account using paypal.
I'm not sending anything international, this is all small amounts, and domestic. If I could convince those people to use bitcoin it would be a boon for both of us. Instant money transfer, no fees, no buyer being a douchebag and requesting a chargeback through paypal (I sell small motorcycle parts to a large forum sometimes, and some buyers may be random/unknown people)
Credit card numbers get stolen every day
Paypal gets hacked easier than you lose your BTC wallet password.
I think the real reason people are uncomfortable is that you are the sole person responsible for your money, and maybe most people just can't handle that.

If the price falls through the "return point" aka where miners stop seeing a profit, they will move on to another coin.
right now, the GPU miners are officially moving off to LTC or something else. So you have a more concentrated BTC market (aka fewer holders, smaller volume, lower velocity) which is what we are seeing now. The real increase will come when those GPU miners will recieve their ASIC's, and may even stay on altcoins with GPU's giving them dual income streams, and more liquidity to the markets.

Its a different situation when the country you live in has currency controls on the money flowing in/out of said country.
Most of us do not live with currency controls, and hence it would be a "panic buy". But take Argentina for example, there is a black market for currency because of strict controls.

DGM is a more stable payout. At Eclipse, if the mining pool luck is over 50%, DGM is more profitable. DGM is payout every time a block is found, rather than a pay per share. Here is an analysis that ozcoin did on their pool with the various methods. 
Also, even with the difficulty increase, I have not seen too much reduction in my per-block payouts. I went from .23 a block to about .18-.19 and this is surviving 3 difficulty increases.
@_date: 2013-06-11 17:32:13
I mine on Eclipse MC. It is remarkably stable, a smaller but still significant pool (which I like), and is the only one to pay out in DGM, which if you are going to be mining 24/7 is really the way to be.

To take money from one bank account to another using paypal as a medium takes that long (3-4 days from each bank to paypal). At the moment unless you buy on Localbtc or from Coinbase with level 2 verification you will see the same delay in USD--&gt;BTC--&gt;USD transfers.


Mtgox is a trading platform, NOT a way to acquire bitcoins. Sure, you can do it this way but it is HORRIBLY inefficient at doing so. As are most USD based trading platforms.


Touche. It costs .99% fee with bitcoin or 2.9% + .30 cents with credit card/paypal


You are going to run the risk of being scammed this way regardless of how you choose to pay. Fortunately there are easy to use escrow services with bitcoins to help alleviate this concern. 
Also, as a seller (who's goal is to continue selling goods) it makes no sense to wantonly scam people, regardless of the currency used. Your whole goal is to sell a product and not delivering said product is counter-intuitive.


So basically you don't want to take any responsibility for your own actions. got it. In addition, your bank/paypal can decide to freeze your account for any number of reasons, charge you things you didn't know of that lead to overdrafts (and then say oh well you still owe). 
You can print your bitcoins onto pieces of paper and carry them in your wallet if that is your concern. You may also carry them in your brain as a "brainwallet". There are many more options than just a file in your computer. Hell you can even keep them in an online wallet with a reputable company if you don't want to do the dirty work! There are so many options that you may have not even known of. Please do research!!
And finally, have you even tried Coinbase yet?
I don't work there, I don't even know those people but their wallet/service is basically the Paypal of the Bitcoin world. Its ridiculously easy for you to track your spending, purchase and sell bitcoins, and send them to anywhere you want. It basically alleviates ALL of your concerns, and somehow I don't think you've bothered to look into it.
