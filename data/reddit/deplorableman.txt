What a silly measurement. There are a shitton of countries with lower energy usage than the city I live in.

Now bitcoin coverage is kinda viral these days it reminds me of the fake news during the election. 
But we still winning.

1 - 2 days, but first time transfers can take longer
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:41:07
Pretty sure they will fix that and that's why it is worth this much.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:17:09
Nothing more stupid than closing your entire position in this epic bull run. There is no reason to do that unless you're in very desperate need of cash.


This is needed to generate a userbase for a system where transactions make sense.


Lol! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:29:11
I don't see the problem. This system requires a lot of energy to protect it. So be it. Taking a plane to go on holiday also is a waste of energy and ruins the planet, only for personal enjoyment. 
Are you boycotting aviation too? Christmas lights?

Same. Put 20% of my savings in BTC a year ago. They were telling me to not do it.
Now I'm sitting in profit and they're telling me to sell it all (since 5k lol). 
They can fuck off.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:25:35
Of course it is, I margin trade and make massive gains on small buys like €350. You gotta look at it percentage wise.
Although the rise we're seeing is unseen so a correction is very possible. You should spread your buy over 2 months and do a weekly buy which will average out the price and make a possible drop less painful. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:04:52


I would have responded to the issues you raised but this is so silly it clearly isn't worth it.

He wasn't democratically chosen. Democratic elections require more than just "voting". Hint: free press, opposition, ...
before you start spreading that retarded stupidity again: 
I guess you can look up how the opposition is faring yourself.

@_date: 2018-08-08 10:50:00
I would, up to a certain percentage.

it's a visual representation of the order book. The amount of btc that needs to be bought/sold to get to a higher/lower price (that's being traded atm).

As a react/frontend dev, any ideas for bitcoin related projects to work on or contribute?

Me and loads of people in Europe don't have credit cards.
I've never bought anything in an app store because of this. Things have changed (more payment options) but I'm used to not buying anything there now.

Any Lightning 'expert' who can shine a light; will Lightning ever be viable for tipping online? That's one of the killer apps, but as far as I know the receiver needs to be online too, making it unreliable...

It's a classic Trump response as in only an idiot would take time out of his day to argue with you (I admit, I feel myself getting more stupid replying to you).

Let it rest for a while, if u don't really need the money and would just waste it.
Price is pretty damn low rn.

I live in Western EU and a national wire transfer takes 2 days, and they don't even work over the weekend lol.

My mother, who told me not to put any savings in, told me to sell at 5k. 
I don't listen to her.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:19:52
I have a weekly buy of 10 euros. Each and every one of those has made me more. It adds up nicely over a year or more.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:28:49
Buy 10 a day, you'll either be happy you didn't buy in 100% before a crash, or you'll be happy you're partly in on the boom.

You make an insightful post on some social media, it goes viral, people start to send u some money to thank you, you have an 8 hour flight (bad timing), gone is your money.
Flight, traveling, dropped phone... etc. Enough cases where u're not connected to the internet and you could potentially miss thousands (and if you have hundreds of thousands of users, this will happen).

what u need to make is a keychain hanger like this:  (the right part)
