Your answer is valid for current situation. But if another economic crisis attacks the world like that happened in 2007, banks will probably be closed, accounts frozen, and financial stability gone.

Maybe :))

Your answer is really technical and neutral. As it turns out, you have completely understood the technology behind Bitcoin. Thanks for your contribution to this post.
@_date: 2018-11-04 16:47:36
The best time to accumulate some Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-04 16:39:43
Not a bubble but a love
@_date: 2018-11-03 17:54:44
Really? Why?
@_date: 2018-11-01 11:47:16
Who is Yoda?!
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:39:34
Why people in reddit do not pay attention to posts that much?
@_date: 2018-11-01 09:20:47
Guys, why Bitcoin price does not indicate its direction?
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:21:47

The moon is behind of him. He will overcome anything he wants. Human talent and willingness can surpass any speed.
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:50:54
Sorry dude
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:18:52
So you consider Bitcoin is likely to be dead, but decentralization will remain alive and grow?
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:20:48
Let's see...
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:34:41
Yes, the vast majority of people do not think about what new solutions are designed for.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:03:14
Any possibility for other coins to surpass Bitcoin at price in the future? Why?
