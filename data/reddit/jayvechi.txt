is this sarcasm or you serious?
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:52:30
haha made me giggle 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:02:40
how much to uk?
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:12:27
I agree with this. America is purely a winner takes all society. Greed has a major grip in the states. Not such a nice place in this sense.
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:17:24
how easy would it be for the price of a bitcoin to hit say 50k and 500k?
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:50:59
monero also guys 
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:31:57
This is crazy. 
How many bitcoin need to be sold at a certain price to drive the price down?
I thought that 200 billion was the amount that had been paid for bitcoin in total haha 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:42:32
that is superb I'd put that up on my wall
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:48:11
I hope you are wrong mate ha.
it feels like it might be over but isn't this normal and happens a few times a year.
I've only been involved since October so going from things I've read.
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:10:41
thanks for all the replies 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:10:26
I think its around that yes.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:48:46
thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:14:28
I hope you are saying the real football is a game you play with your feet and not the fake arse American version haha 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:36:18
very good. thanks for posting 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:02:40
I totally get what you are saying.
I have spread my money out across 10 cryptos but btc is by far the largest chunk.
I am always telling myself sell off all of X and invest it into btc. but I don't for the simple fact I am worried the X I sell explodes. probably silly but thats my mentality.
for the record I don't plan on buying any bitcoin cash at present. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:36:09
ok my question was do you think cash could ever overtake the original in terms of usage and value
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:04:28
for real?
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:18:47
what do you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:13:12
We also have the same type of things happening in the UK. Just not as blatant as trump.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:50:03
thanks I'll watch this. I'm sure I'm gonna hate him already 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:57:02
I didn't get into the game until October so I'm not involved.
If I was I'd hodl bitcoin cash. id do it because we just don't know how high it's gonna go. or maybe I'm just a natural born hodler 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:35:00
wow haha 
I am a little confused. when it says a dildo in his boot. does it mean his actual car boot or up his arse?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:34:25
yeah it's gonna be very interesting 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:33:02
the trick is to hodl haha 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:12:06
I don't watch CNN no I'm from the UK.
But I do know trump has just made changes to the tax laws which will benefit him and his mega rich buddies and will affect most people negatively.
I'm sure you have heard of these? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:59:08
I'm thinking is may not happen.
Do you think it's possible it overtakes the real bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:34:03
tell you what you sell me your coins. I'll be happy to help 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:01:32
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:28:40
that makes sense i didn't think of that. thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:58:00
don't worry mate btc will bounce back and climb lots more.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:26:48
Can someone please tell me who this guy is exactly and his previous track record.
all I know is he is the head of bitcash and he is hated by us btc guys 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:55:46
yes it can hold 5 different ones max.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:31:09
left winger here.
right wingers are either misinformed or selfish without empathy.
just my opinion haha 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:16:46
Good read that. I hope to god he is right.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:10:37
I think people on the left in many countries are not happy with the bent and corrupt politicians in charge.
Many developed countries now are having lots of laws changed to benefit the mega rich. These are changed at the request of the mega rich.
Bitcoin if it explodes like some people hope would put and end to some of this disgusting exploitation of power.
So yes I can see why people on the left would love the idea and back bitcoin.
Also I think a true left person would voluntarily pay their taxes if it did go down the crypto route. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:42:27
thanks for the replies man 
@_date: 2018-05-09 21:55:25
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:58:22
thanks 
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:29:54
I think he only tips 14 or 16 different coins?
Do you know the exact coins he recommends?
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:55:52
This worked like a charm! i have another website I want to do the same with. can I have a different address for this one as I don't want the same address on both sites as it will link them to rivals.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:33:33
Do you have any proof that he's upto shady stuff like this?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:42:35
I've done something similar. The more I read about bitcoin the more I love it. I totally get and like what it's about. Just understand that their is probably gonna be some major dips in future.
When they do just sit tight and wait for it to blow over. Bitcoin is here to stay.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:33:14
but let's say I plug the hardware wallet in 5 years times and it's died?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:09:26
what's an ath?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:58:22
fake news 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:38:47
sorry for all the questions guys I am totally new with this.
can I store btc, ltc and eth on the same hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:59:12
thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:14:08
someone PMd me and said it is gonna die :)
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:48:29
if I lose the hardware wallet and seed I am screwed right?
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:07:54
I just can't wrap my head around people buying it at such high rates. I hope I am wrong big time.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:19:51
how can I create transactions that fail on coinbase? 
gonna give this a shot.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:00:41
I bought some litecoin yesterday. Not sure if that's recent enough to help you.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:35:40
but what if the hardware wallet malfunctions? I lose my loot?
can I hide btc, ltc, eth, on the same hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:06:37
If it gets even close to the 80k I will withdraw my initial investment and freerole hodl for decades.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:03:22
yeah that makes sense. but would you say that it's overpriced and may tumble down in future.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:55:44
Thanks for taking the time to explain all that. I have just ordered the nano s ledger off Amazon. This will arrive with me tomorrow so I will probably be asking questions on how to ship the coins to it then haha 
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:46:22
why is it terrifying?
do you just add a 24 word password and you get your coins?
I am a total noob so sorry for any silly questions.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:37:52
is it automatically backed up incase it does or do I do that myself?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:54:26
My guess is 15k end of next year 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:49:13
thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:30:22
what hardware wallet should I buy? any recommendations.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:40:17
thanks for the replies guys. made me feel a whole lot better. I've only been at this crypto for 3 weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:13:35
sure am haha 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:07:12
Thanks mate.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:12:48
I hope you are right my friend.
I feel like slapping myself haha. 
Shoulda just hodl'd like they say.
I have a feeling it's gonna go on a huge tear now and moon.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:14:06
Not looking for validation mate. It's does suck though. My own fault entirely.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:13:14
I did man. Amateur mistake.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:19:38
yeah you are correct in what you say.
If I don't get back in at the price I was in at I will have to accept it as lesson learnt. an expensive one.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:27:54
I pulled out the same amount of fiat as I invested. So I'm not in a bad as position as some that sell on a down slide.
Still hurting my soul though haha.
Good advice man thanks.
@_date: 2018-07-27 09:15:02
Fingers and toes are crossed!
@_date: 2018-04-21 17:17:35
is it possible to offer a discount for bitcoin payments?
I want to give an incentive for ppl to pay with bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-04-20 20:04:19

@_date: 2018-04-24 20:23:04

@_date: 2018-04-18 18:09:52
