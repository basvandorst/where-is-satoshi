I didn't follow the tech that closely, literally saw a Reddit post and thought it was cool, installed on a few machines then stopped mining "Cause this isn't going anywhere" and I am an autist.

That is my cloud backup.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:43:28
How do I do that?
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:50:40
Oh wow please explain...

I am just panicking, I just pulled this computer out of my mom's garage. It isn't connected to the internet right now. Can I load this into the current core? There is a version conflict from 1.0, no?

Yeah, I am all caught up. Last transaction 01/24/14. Everyone I tell about my bitcoin story thinks I lost out. I sold that 50 coins for $10k which I spent on the down payment on my house. The real reason I am glad I sold is all the coins were on Mt. Gox, and if I HADN'T sold I would of just lost them to the hack.
Congrats you bastards.

Oh I see you want me to just try and read it by the core installed and see if I can get in. That makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:23:04
Oh well, it was the same file. I know I had another 50 coin's somewhere. Probably lost to the bitcoin gods. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:50:14
Any idea? Trying this other file.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:51:22
I don't want to plug this computer into the internet. I can't be sure it is clean. Just back up the file and load into the modern core?
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:54:04
I am not convinced there are coins in this wallet. But I have older wallets from this era, are those transactions worth anything?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:04:46
In honesty, it is probably empty I only had one wallet I was sure I had backups of (Just since it was my gaming rig) I am trying to not get too excited.

I remember being able to import into the appdata folder for the bitcoin core but that appdata folder isn't there. I can copy the wallet.dat into the folder the client is installed on and it seems like it is opening it but no transactions are found and I had several from this wallet.
