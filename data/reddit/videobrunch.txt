That’s not really true. For multiple reasons (one being the familiar tune “you don’t have to buy a whole bitcoin”). My biggest take away from a recent trip to Africa was a lack of banking for everyday folks. In Cameroon you have to be a property owner over 35 to get a bank account.
Developing economies actually have me very bullish on crypto Long term, it could solve a real problem for a large population. Which coin(s) will it be is the question - btc has the psychological barrier you just mentioned.

Well fuck I just checked the price because of this and now I’m crying

Africa is HUGE - the whole continent doesn’t do one thing

No shit it’s a good thing - bitcoin doesn’t advertise

All us normies are broke from all the dips

This is how I feel too - the normies don’t want to feel like they have to do anything extra ... I got the bitcoins , and I have an app where I can see them is what adoption is going to look like.

So... it’s ... sort of like a stock.

Take a seat at the feet of another opinion

Naw dog, this sentiment is racist. Straight up. I’m not virtue signaling or whatever you’re implying. I say let’s see the individual countries and their struggles. 
Case and point: Cameroon has their internet shut off regularly by the government - why / how would they invest in crypto ? It would be great for them because the banking laws are insane there - it’s exceedingly difficult to get a bank account unless you’re over 35 and own property. How can we get them involved ? They’re ready.
