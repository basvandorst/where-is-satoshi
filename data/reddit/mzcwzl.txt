What’s the speculation on the recent drop in mempool txns?

And why can’t you (you personally) mine?

There are millions (10-100 million) of magnetic disks spinning 24/7/365 for at least 5 years, many of which are only turned on once until they’re decommissioned. You should have no problem running yours 24/7/365 until the mempool issue is resolved.

Definitely think in your situation selling 2-3 full coins will help lower your stress and give you a nice cushion to really start your life how you want it.

Why is this BS?

How long between sending the coins and the buyer saying they received? Maybe the wallet software showed the incoming transaction but with no verification blocks. Is the transaction on any block explorer at all? If not, definitely fishy...

There was some discussion on a recent thread about this.. are you using an external drive or slow HD by chance?

Tried rebuilding/downloading the whole chain earlier this week. Took forever on an external drive, an older HD, and a fast NAS. Took 12 hours on my main PC (2600k era) after I installed a new SSD with enough space.. seems like it is more disk limited than it should be.

GPS is 100% a US military project. It's run by the US Air Force. 
Edit: I'm referring to US GPS. The others are called GLONASS (Russia), Galileo (Europe), Beidou (China), etc.

If you're using windows open up resource monitor and take a look at the disk tab. You'll see your physical drives listed in the storage portion towards the bottom. If the disk queue length is &gt;1 consistently, or if the active time is near 100%, you are disk-bound.

West Texas has a giant oversupply of natural gas coming from all of the oil wells in the Permian basin. The wellhead pricing can actually be negative (they pay you to take the gas) because of how little export capacity there is. I’m not sure about these guys specifically, but if they’re using that natural gas, their fuel cost will be minimal. It will also easily run 24/7, unlike wind turbines/solar.

See my other reply.. there is an option you can add to the config file to limit daily upload. 
The above will limit your node to 1GB per day.

Will limit to 1GB per day. This is how I run mine after I blew through a TB not realizing how much I could upload.

Run your own node and connect directly to its own API/RPC? Should be very fast.

This is the bitcoin genesis block (block  and it’s contents. Believe the creator used a news headline to mark the date.
