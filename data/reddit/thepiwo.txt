I think orphan rate is something people in the future have to live with. It doesn't harm the network much. Everybody has a higher orphan rate, so it shouldn't be unfair.

Running a node is a something Bitcoin related cooperations will do. $1000 is not much for them.
Today every company accepting credit cards has to buy the terminals that are not cheap either.
Every normal person can just use SVP wallets, maybe connected to a specific node they trust.

But he wouldn't lose money because electrum and every other HD wallet would store the private key for used addresses forever.
To OP: as long as you have a backup of your wallet seed you won't lose any money by using used addresses again. Not using them again is only a privacy regard.

Something directly like Bitcoin is not possible with filestoring, unless you have reeeeeally high fees. The bandwith and space used for every peer would be enormus. But there are (ideeas for) distributed cloudstoring systems where your files are encrypted and uploaded to multiple trusted computers and if one of them goes down, all the files he had would get mirrored from the other computers that have this files, to different PCs in this network. The Contol over all of this would be done distributed with a blockchain technology storing hashes of every file and data about its location and it would controll fees.
Have a look at Maidsafe or Storj they are trying something like this.

When you write you want a solution, like Bitcoin is the solution for decentralized money, I think the right answer would be namecoin, too. It would first use a bit domain and would be difficult to use. But if ICANN and DNS would integrate Namecoin, or most of the people would choose a namecoin-based system, or hybrid system, it will succeed. Remember, Bitcoin isn't a technology for Euro, USD or any other Currency, it's something completely different and difficult to integrate with regular money.

It would be possible (i don't know exactly how) but because electrum saves the keys as HD-Wallet it would be more secure and anonym if you'll just send them over to electrum. It would be easier to backup, too. Just write down the electrum seed.

Couldn't there be an open Key-Server like thing. So if I want to revoke my address, I sign a predefined message with the private-key of that address. And the wallet witch has implemented my system checks if there is a message for my address and the signature is fine, then denies to send the bitcoin. Sure there must be a force send button or something like this. And through an open system there would be no fraud.

The derivation from private key to address could work differently than with Bitcoin, but produce valid bitcoin addresses. In this case your Bitcoin wallet will generate a different address from the private key.

@_date: 2015-09-02 09:05:39
So you are saying if all miners wanted bigger blocks, they won't get them? They can just increase the limit, as long as every other miner does the same. So if they'd want BIP100 without 32MB limit, they could just have it.
@_date: 2015-09-02 07:05:48
If there would be a problem with extremely huge blocks, bitcoin could fork again to fix it.

No, Insight needs to work trough the data from the Bitcoin client, that doesn't take this long, maybe 1-3 Days.
But Toshi builds itself a unique database where you could do simple queries, this is why it takes much longer than the other clients.
@_date: 2015-03-24 06:41:34
OK, you're welcome
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:41:39

Maybe something like Insight by BitPay or Toshi by Coinbase is what you search for. With Insight you get an API where you can call detailed transaction/address data, about 70Gb are needed (35gb bitcoin client-data, 35gb insight database) but calling complex queries is difficult and querying big addresses is slow.
Toshi is its own fullnode, with the Blockchain saved in a SQL-DB, you need about 350GB bit get a really rich SQL-Structure where you could do complex queries fast.
@_date: 2015-03-23 21:47:05
maybe this is the faster solution for you, but doesn't blockchain.info limit the api usage?

Hi ken,
we know each other from the Munich Bitcoin Meetup.
I really like your ideas and i like that you are getting precise in how you think it should work. Your ideas are a big step into the future, both ePlug and Factum combined really could change the world.
But as OX3 said, i would keep Ideas like this out of a whitepaper. A whitepaper should provide the pure Facts, exactly how your Ideas will work. Concrete architectual concepts. A paper, people could argument on, if your try on getting it well an bulletproof, as you describe it, will work as intended.

You have a problem in your thoughts there. If you do a transaktion it gets marked as send and will be transmitted to all your connected peers, and their peers. So you'll see it pop up in your client. But at this time it isn't written in the blockchain. When the next block is mined (every 10Minutes) your transaction gets written in the block, which gets transmitted through all peers. An update every 10minutes is not a problem in the internet.
