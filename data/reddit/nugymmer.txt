There's also an "unsubscribe" link in that email. I deleted the email anyway. It's likely to be a phishing link, and the "unsubscribe" is probably just a dummy unsubscribe page that does nothing. It's the confirmation link that is probably the real danger here, as it's almost certain to be a phishing page.
But never click on any links in any phishing email, especially if they ask for credentials/logins etc.

True. I thought it was weird that 70M coins had already been released when the price was ~$2/ETH and the market cap was ~$140M. Part of me said to be careful but another part of me said ETH might be the one to rise to 2nd place.
That half of me was right and that half wants to beat the other half to death for possibly confining each other to a life of financial mediocrity.

I wouldn't say they are lying to themselves, as much as trying to placate themselves. What they're trying to do is make the most of their limited psychological health.
It is true that for some it doesn't buy happiness. Just ask anyone with depression so severe they can't even feel any emotion whatsoever. They probably wouldn't even respond to a billion dollars, much less a million. Or those who suffer from major PTSD.
If you're psychologically healthy (I know I am not, so count me out), then sure, it might buy happiness, up to a certain point and past that point it doesn't make much difference. The $75K per year, comfortable lifestyle, is roughly that threshold where increasing money won't actually improve psychological health.
I have a very comfortable lifestyle, objectively speaking - plenty of nutritious meals, security, creature comforts, plenty of free time since I work only 16 hours a week, yet I am still depressed and feel flat most days, some days feeling terrible.
But then again, I've spent nearly half of my life on antipsychotics, antidepressants and even drugs for epilepsy. Also being on the autistic spectrum makes things very difficult - even for those who do have money, what makes it worse is that it's an invisible disability, doesn't cripple me outwardly but I feel dead inside most of the time.

Update: screw it, I bought a Ledger.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:55:15
Likewise in 2013-2014, the move from $1000 to $400 was quick, but the move from $650 to $200 later in 2014 to early 2015 was slower.
I believe we could see that again, maybe not for the same reasons, but market movements don't even need a reason - they just happen irrespective of the news whether good or bad.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:04:42
As did I, was toying with the idea of buying 10,000 ether tokens, but for what could have been a hundred different reasons, didn't...and now, well, it kinda sucks...but it isn't a life-or-death situation...just disappointing.

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:47:53

This time is no different.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:09:11
They hate it because they're butthurt that they didn't get some cheap when it was a few dollars (or, God forbid, even cheaper, a few cents!).
Yes, it sucks. I used to feel this way because I didn't have any. But sometimes you have to accept it, even if it hurts.

If only those 488 BTC had been reinvested in the 2014 Ethereum crowdsale...488 BTC would have been almost 1,000,000 Ether.
I always think about 2012 for some reason. I always wish I'd bought say 1000 coins for say $6k would have been easily doable...but alas I didn't. I could have invested 250 BTC in the Ethereum ICO, hell even 100 BTC would have given me well over $100M.
Enough to make a grown man cry. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:56:55
You don't understand. You needed to do both:
1/ import the private key and
2/ spend the bitcoin to a new address that was added with the seed generated by the mycelium wallet (sweeping the funds to the new mycelium wallet)
Perhaps you've done this, but you want to be absolutely sure you still have the funds intact before sending any more from the exchange.
I hope it wasn't a huge amount.

Anonymity is a tough nut to crack, but Monero has that covered, at least for now.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:10:15
I'll go out on a limb and say that the only reason ETH, XRP and DASH have had such success during their early years is because so many coins were diverted to the developers who could then essentially fund the promotion of those coins.
I really don't see how these coins ever compare to Bitcoin.
Coins like Monero, Litecoin and Vertcoin had a much fairer start to their success stories. It's these coins we should be focusing on. And by God have they had some amazing success - all through zero funding and no premines, and no diversion of coins to developers. Like Bitcoin, they essentially had to be mined and those who believed in the project kept working tirelessly. The end result is these coins have also succeeded massively. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:33:08
99% were shitcoins, but not ETH.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:17:38


Not all of them. Most of them, perhaps...but you'd have to prove it with objective facts.
I can say with certainty that Monero, Litecoin and Vertcoin are very far from centralized. Neither do these coins have premines, or central points of failue, or special interests.
The miners control the system. Same as with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:16:08
Well, if McAfee had converted a few Bitcoins to Verge this time last year, well, he would have to eat his dick, eh?
3 BTC @ Dec 2016 ~$600/BTC. Would buy about 73,000,000 XVG.
Holy fuck? Holy fuck indeed.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:30:02
This...had fleeting thoughts of buying 10,000 in 2015...earlier this year felt really bad and felt just as bad recently when it hit an ATH. This indeed. It sucks doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:17:53
$50M? You serious?
Maybe buy XRP, turn that $50M into $100M, then buy $100M worth of BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:31:30
So that explains why Verge took off?

@_date: 2017-12-24 09:17:44
Those who invested a few hundred dollars in XVG earlier in the year would be happy to volunteer to eat McAfee's dick, I'm sure of it!
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:45:20


Ethereum, DASH, Ripple...I guess they've already had their massive run-up and any upside potential is probably far less than what it was this time last year.
As for VTC, and IOTA, well, that may indeed be a different story, and there is plenty of upside potential. But the other three have already achieved enormous market caps.
Always be on the lookout for smaller cap crypto with a promising technology. This year, that would have been Factom or Decred...both went up massively.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:46:04
As is the memory of spending $10,000 on 20,000 ETH...

Nah, they would have all taken a big dump...BTC and the alts, altogether. Best way if one wants to risk the possibility of a major bear trap, is to sell for cash, then buy back in later at a hopefully much lower price point.

This might put a sizeable dent in DASH. Who knows? The only thing I found attractive was the instant transactions, but this might change all that. Will LN allow instant transactions without requiring a "masternode" setup?
I guess it won't change the fact that masternode owners get paid very handsomely though, and maybe that is the *real* attraction there.

It probably won't be Bitcoin, either.
Most likely what will ultimately be the cryptocurrency or blockchain or digital "ledger" that all of us will eventually use, will be something that has not yet come into existence, and will probably make the gains that Bitcoin and Ether have made seem rather small in comparison.

What about Monero's ring signatures, or the mixing features of DASH? How will these stand up?
SegWit isn't being blocked, it's just not developing as quickly as anticipated. As for the reason why, I don't know.

@_date: 2017-03-17 05:37:59
Well if it does bother you, why not pick a few alts and diversify? Isn't this exactly what other investors and early adopters are doing?
Follow them. Roger Ver is doing it, as are other major BTC holders.
And when the alts are at their short or mid term top, sell them and exchange them for cheaper Bitcoins. It's worked for so many people, why shouldn't it work for you too?
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:33:49
BU = Bitcoin Undone LOL
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:14:00
Oh, really?
Good luck with that, eh.
More likely they'll just force AML/KYC on every exchange, force users who own Monero, DASH, ZCash, Shadowcoin, and other coins offering mixing/ring signatures/zkSnarks to divulge their transactions to prove legitimate source of wealth. It's that simple, and they will do that I'm sure.

True...but a much better time would have been January 2015...or better still, December 2011...oh wait, how about paying some random dude on bitcointalk €60 via PayPal after winning a bid for a cool 10k BTC...5k BTC would be paid with the remainder 5k BTC after the payment went through.
Damn this makes me cringe. What makes me cringe even more was watching ETH tank below $1 and not buying 10k ETH when the getting was so damned good and I had the money.
Now I guess...erm, I'll just be a nobody. *heavy sigh*

True, but what I was getting at was that it's getting very late in the game, and the number of BTC you can buy for your fiat has dropped crazy low.
For $1...one lousy dollar I could have owned 1000...but now what will $1 buy me...about 1/6500th? LOL

What's even more bizarre is that mutilating an infant boy's genitals for nonmedical reasons hardly ever gets questioned and when it does it's often a negative view of whoever is questioning it and much support for those defending it.

Hahaha. I'm pretty easy going really. But when that topic comes up I turn white hot with anger especially when they threaten me for voicing my opinion. Then I turn into a wasp. Thankfully I've never had to fight even though I am more than strong enough to stand my ground.
It's also very illegal to carry anything other than your arms in Australia so that last bit would get me into strife.
@_date: 2019-12-27 05:47:01
We have a similar problem in Australia but it's not quite as bad as the USA. Aussie boys used to be cut in the 1950s and the rate was roughly 80%. Almost the same as the USA with its 90%+ rate. I remember Wisconsin had a supposed 99% rate in 1964.
It's still bad here in Aus. We have an average 5% rate give or take 1 or 2%. It should be less than 1%.
The USA is a basketcase with a 40-60% rate.
@_date: 2016-09-29 03:43:00


How exactly? I just answered your question below, but never saw an answer to that one.
REAL money, again, as I said before, is buying something very cheap, and watching it become very expensive. Like some of the successful alts. The gains on FCT, XMR and DASH, and ETH aren't exactly mind boggling like BTC was...but they're impressive gains nonetheless. I would have easily made 10x the money on one of these alts, aside from DASH which saw a 4x increase. Not bad.
But QRK?
Nup, a loss of 99% of my money. Yes, I'm an idiot for believing Kolin Evans and his followers. I used to be faithful, but if I believe in fairies, well, I deserve whatever I get. QRK was a fairy tale. And now that tale has met its end...uh.
@_date: 2016-09-19 10:13:15
To Kolin Evans, and Bill Still, $1,000,000 is probably not a great deal. You know, the guys who pumped Quark, made off like bandits, and left us holding a bag of worthless shitcoins. Christ! I feel like an imbecile!
@_date: 2016-09-29 03:30:05
I've missed more than one boat this time. There were a few very good boats. It's a shame I caught the Quark boat because it crashed and I drowned.
I hear those other boats are like luxury cruises. Why didn't I catch at least one of those?
Quark was like an old rusty dingy...it was a failure from the very start.
@_date: 2016-09-29 05:51:40
In spite of the BTC bashing, I still think BTC will win in the end. It will likely do so after incorporating all the features of the alt coins that obviously have a vision of destroying it. Then BTC will destroy them all ;)
@_date: 2016-09-29 03:32:17
Catching the Quark boat is like getting into an old rusty Dinghy...so yes, I concur, a major risk of loss...
It did go up 10x in 2015...but it's gone back down since then I think. Forget about it. There are other alts that are just lapping it up, and shitting all over it from 8 miles high.
@_date: 2016-09-29 03:34:03
Asic resistance isn't actually nonsense, if you think of coins such as Factom and Monero. Those are not 100% Asic resistance, because it's virtually impossible to be, but these two are close. But so is Quark.
It's just that the other two are luxury cruise liners and Quark is an old rusty Dinghy. The other two would have been much better, even in 2014, to invest in...the Quark...well, what can I say?
Awwwwwww SHUCKS!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:45:13
Had about 27 days between the ATH and the second peak, and another 16 days to sell between there and $13k.
Next real bull run? We're talking several years, I'm certain it will take at least 1 year. 
I still think we will experience a major counter rally that could take us back to $14k. That will be the final selling opportunity as once that counter rally runs out of steam that would be the end...at least for a year or more.
@_date: 2016-09-16 22:52:52
I should now just add to this and change ETH to XMR.
Wow, I feel like a fucking moron of epic proportions. Wow, woe is me. What an idiot!
@_date: 2016-09-29 06:45:26
People will change their mind when the see $$$ in their eyes.
I'm still not 100% sure which altcoin to pick. I still haven't yet opened an account on one of the good exchanges - I've been a bit depressed by the whole scenario.
I have 100 DASH that I bought privately, and of course, the 31,000 QRK ;)
I think with QRK, I'll have to own up to the fact that I simply picked the wrong one and move on. But I don't want to miss the boat again. I did that with Bitcoin, I've been regretting not finding out about it in 2009 and I've been beating myself up about it ever since 2013 when BTC hit $1000+
@_date: 2016-09-29 05:50:00
Yep. He's a real piece of work.
Bill Shill. Haha, that's a perfect name for this bastard.
Like Kolin Evans, it was just a way to make a quick buck, at everyone else's expense.
I bet, like Bill Shill, Kolin Evans, got a lot of QRK for nothing or for next to nothing, and wanted to get rid of it very quickly. He sold me about 31,000 QRK at 10 cents a piece in January/February 2014.
If I'd saved that $3000 and spent in some worthwhile alt, I'd probably be in a much better position today. Or maybe not, but that's beside the point. He ripped me and many others off, and he knew full well what he was doing.
Kolin has disappeared for good, it seems...unless someone knows where he is on these reddits, I'm so disgusted in the guy that I don't even want to bother looking for him. His email no longer responds, though I've never had any messages bounce back. I think he knows I suddenly realised what a scammer he is.
I bet Kolin is sitting on a mountain of DASH, XMR, and ETH.
And for that, seriously, I hate him inside out. He knew it was a scam.

Through your PhD research you believe we are in the early stage of a golden bull run?

@_date: 2017-09-23 10:17:13
Would be a great buying opportunity to acquire some cheap Monero, as the typical market action ensues where virtually all alt coins tend to drop significantly more than Bitcoin does when it drops...BTC at $500 would mean Monero at $10 or less...perhaps wishful thinking for those wanting to get cheap Monero, but a fantastic buying opportunity if such scenario plays out.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:33:32


It's collapsed damn near 60% since it's all-time-high...and it looks like that 60% will become 80%...
Sure, it might be a safe haven, but that'll be years away...that will be after all the money has been bled out of the markets first...and it will be another 3+ years until we see BTC at or near $20K again.
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:35:25

If it hits $4K or below, might be a good time...but nobody knows, we don't have a crystal ball.

Long term bull for sure, mid term bear...
Well, mid term bear between 2013-2015 too. Mid term means 6 months to 2 years. Short term means less than 6 months. Long term is more than 2 years.
2013-2015 was mid term. Look what happened to BTC during that time frame.
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:00:11

@_date: 2018-02-10 21:38:45
Sounds like we just crashed again, or we're crashing again.
Was a nice last couple of days...but I still see a counter rally in the coming weeks/months.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:45:15
That's not much consolation to someone who didn't sell close to the top and is now down significantly and could have used that extra cash to buy more BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:42:26
Look, nothing is going to reverse the bear market.
The bear market will end when the bears go away. That could be a couple of years away.
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:45:41
Yeah, it absolutely is true. I had a chance to sell my crypto portfolio at or near the peak. Was mulling over the lost opportunity to buy 10,000 Ethereum tokens for like $1...and then realised that my crypto portfolio has taken a hammering. Probably down 50% at least.
This point is true. 1/ there was absolutely *nothing* I could have done about not buying cheap Ether. 2/ there absolutely was *something* I could have done, but didn't, at the time, because of 1/.
And later there will be more opportunities coming up, and you know what? I'm not going to give two shits about my portfolio, I'm going to be on the lookout, ears to the ground, for the next likely opportunity in crypto that will take what I invest and multiply it 1000x.
Will it happen? Probably not, but is it worth a chance? Absolutely, and by moping and mulling about my porfolio getting crushed (no, I won't sell, for many reasons, least of which the cryptos I chose have a bright future) I will be missing out on receiving or finding new information about new opportunities that could potentially turn a thousand into a million.

2011-2012: From $30 to $2...it's not worth it, it's vaporware, it's pathetic.
2013-2015: From $1000 to $200...It's dead, it's gone, it's dying, it's hopeless.
2017-2019: From $5000 to $1000...it's dead, it's nothing, ditch it, sell out now before you lose everything!
But what about 2009-2011...or 2015-2017...
Wasn't dead then, was it? Still ain't dead.
Still alive and a kickin'. Will withstand everything the naysayer commentators and governments/banks try to throw at it. Let's face it, it's unstoppable!

Like what? Gold? Silver? Stocks? Bonds?
The whole market is being crushed. Crypto or otherwise.

Or if you didn't sell @ $19k...
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:40:38
I can see BTC rallying to $12-14K but the rally will only last a month or so at most. The next leg down (as it happened in 2014 after the ETH crowdsale) will be the most brutal decline. Right down to ~$4k
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:22:53
Ouch. $360...
Not sure what ghosting deposits means...other than deposits that are not verified?

Been HODLing since 2015, 2016 and 2017.
I should be thankful everytime my portfolio gets hammered? Seems odd unless one is a masochist.

Well, what do you know?
Didn't I tell everyone?

To the point, I bet Kolin Evans owns a lot of XMR, FCT, and other successful alts, or at least a boatload of cash. He knew how to game the markets. Unfortunately, he really did control Quarkcoin market, unlike the others.
He also has a past of resurrecting old dead projects. I don't understand why he just didn't let the projects die. It's not like they were worth anything.
All he has done is burned a lot of fingers.
I was cautiously optimistic about QRK...that is, until I heard that someone dumped over 30,000,000 QRK...who was that?
Surely someone must have an answer. QRK isn't anonymous like XMR or DASH are...so someone should be able to work out by analysing the blockchain that they can find out who dumped the 30 megaquarks...LOL

It can't just keep going down forever. Eventually the selling stops, and coins fall out of weak hands into strong hands. 2014-2015 proved that when the market stabilised for a year or so, and then skyrocketed again.
Each 10% drop I can guarantee someone will be buying on a dollar cost averaging method....and some will be shorting the market.
The bear market never lasts forever. It can last for a couple of years or longer, but what we saw in 2011, 2013, and recently, is enough of a guide.
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:35:04
I wouldn't be surprised if BTC is double today's price this time next year but $100,000 is a bit far fetched to be honest.
2013 it hit $1000
2017 it hit $5000
2021 it *might* hit $25,000
2025 it *might* hit $125,000
Crystal ball anyone?
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:32:54
700btc sell wall getting smashed is really nothing. It's just shorts getting burned and closing out their positions and being forced to buy back BTC.
We see this behaviour after every major rise. It's going to go on like this perhaps for several months. A major counter rally might take us to a high of $12-14k, but then it'll bottom out at ~$4000-$4500
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:54:40
You hope.
Bear market. 2014-2015. Wash, rinse, repeat.

Hopefully when he forges this new country that all forms of genital mutilation and various other atrocities are banished from that society or preferably never start to begin with!
But hats off to him if he can actually achieve that!

Second longest downtrend.
What does that tell you?
Bear market? Or a bear trap?
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:38:52
You might be thankful you sold, in case it dives even further...but then again, this is crypto, the land of the unknowns and extreme volatility...
In 1 year, BTC could be $1000, or it could be $100,000...
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:00:06


And most people involved in crypto don't know whether or not this is the mother of all bubbles that just popped, or whether this is just a temporary setback.
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:58:30
Nope. Me don't care.
I know where BTC is eventually headed.
Either into tens or possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars...
...or zero
The second possibility is very remote...so either the price continues to climb over the years or it eventually stagnates whilst another competing crypto that was flying under the radar storms past BTC's market cap and ultimately crushes it.
Nobody can tell the future. If only we all had a crystal ball...but none of us do.
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:19:08
If Bitcoin is Myspace, then Monero may well be the Facebook.
Or another crypto that hasn't even been created (or under development but not live) yet.
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:26:27
What does volatility indicate? We didn't see this sort of volatility whilst BTC went from $8000 to $18000...
But we're seeing it a lot more often. All this swinging.
You know what it is? It's shorts either getting burned and being forced to dump to cut their losses or it's shorts buying back BTC to profit from their positions. Either way it's not a good sign of a bull confirmation. This happens very frequently when things go awry.
I really and I MEAN really feel sorry for those who bought BTC at the top @ $18k or so.
Hate to say it, but this doesn't look good no matter how you look at it you lose.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:59:04
Future gains? Depends if this is the mother of all crypto bubbles and crypto never recovers to it's previous ATH, or if this is just a temporary setback and crypto rises into the trillions.

The best time to sell was ATH in December last year.
The next best time to sell will be when the counter rally peaks.

How am I clueless? I know that the only way people make real money is by trading. They don't make money by sweating their fucking arse off in a warehouse or factory.
Real money is made by things being REVALUED. As in, that whoever so-and-so that bought 10,000 BTC in 2010 is sitting very very fucking pretty right now.
That, is how REAL money is made. You should never have to work for your money, it is the other way around - your money should be doing the dirty work.
@_date: 2016-07-04 02:42:06
How would I have lost my money had I decided not to fall for the nonsense that QRK was going to be the next Bitcoin?
Darkcoin and Ethereum are going well so how would I have lost money exactly?
@_date: 2016-07-04 03:24:54
What coin is that? Ethereum?

The same guy who just told me how stupid I was. Well I guess he was right, about BOTH these things. That Quark wont amount to anything AND that I am a fucktard for believing it would because of all the propaganda.

So is Ethereum. TOTALLY ASIC RESISTANT.

To the point...THANKS KOLIN! Quarkcoin should have been called SCAMCOIN!

BTC was about $300 in March 2014? I should have bought 10 and left it alone... I could have played the market and turned it into maybe 20 but still better than what I have now, which is about $150
