So it sounds like the guy is an investor who got interested in bitcoin and decided to put money into a bunch of btc startups. That somehow means he's part of a plot to "hurt bitcoin"? 
And what exactly are you so worried about? Is "Roger Ver" going to turn you in to the FBI for buying weed or something? Or maybe send a CIA death squad to your house? Anyway... wallet apps are good for carrying btc for near term spending, sorta like a real life wallet. Nobody with any sense would use a wallet app to store a large amount of coin long term, or to engage in serious illegality.

Google doesn't "spy" on anyone. Spying is, by definition, something done in secret, and is generally contrary to the interests and against the will of the person being spied on. Not only are people aware of the type of information Google and Apple and other companies collect, I'd say a huge portion of the general public actually cynically overestimates the extent of that collection.

People shouldn't be putting amounts of money worthy of "horror stories" into wallet apps in the first place. Wallet apps downloaded from app stores are for convenience, just like actual wallets.

I'm a big supporter of bitcoin and have been since 2011. It's ridiculous to label those who haven't adopted bitcoin or made it part of their business as being hostile to it.

And this is what's wrong with the btc community ... It's battle of the bandwagons... Step 1: pick a side of the latest controversy, Step 2: become an evangelist for that side and shout your strong feels from every rooftop, Step 3: make up conspiracy theories and speculate wildly, Step 4:
