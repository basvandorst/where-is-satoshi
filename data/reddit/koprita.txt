Also he used "literally" when he meant "seriously." Roffle.

Uh, just replace it by whatever value you find more reasonable?
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:37:42
So in other words you have absolutely nothing to add.

I don't disagree with most of your post, but that one sentence was the silliest thing I have read on here yet.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:04:04
Right, well that's just common sense though. The question is, *assuming it does get picked up,* how can anyone make a reasonable prediction about where the price will level off?
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:16:10
No, most of us actually realize that $1,000 is as arbitrary an amount as 1 bitcoin is.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:04:07
Hmm. It's that's a pretty neat thing to have, but I don't think it's very helpful if they don't tell you how they're computing it. 
Also, I'm asking where it will level off. The chance that it succeeds has no bearing on that, because I'm talking about what will happen if and when it succeeds.

Thanks, makes sense to me.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:06:08
Thanks, I hate doing homework.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:00:23
Wow. I didn't think anyone could come up with a more trite answer than "nobody knows," but apparently I stand corrected.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:08:45
fine, but then why 10^-6? Why not 10^-5 or 10^-7?

Aside from the corporate shills who are trying to stymie bitcoin because it is literally their job, people on both sides of this argument have exactly the same motivation. 
They're just trying to protect their own egos. 
The people saying that don't believe in bitcoin want to convince themselves that they're right as much as they want to convince anyone else. The people that are pouring money into it want to convince themselves they aren't squandering it as much as they want to convince anyone else.
Just let go of your ego, make the choices that seem right to you, and know that you don't need to defend them to anyone. Even if bitcoin crashes to zero overnight and all of the naysayers are screaming "I told you so," who cares? You knew you were taking a risk when you bought in. Predicting the future is a superhuman ability, there is no shame in not having it.

Eh. I don't buy it. For the most part I think it's more end consumer products that they want to sell for say, a buck a piece because it's easy for people, but raw meat you're gonna be buying by weight and it can be any amount of money.
Also, not everyone uses the dollar. If 1 mbtc is a dollar here (fyi,m = milli = 1 thousandth, u[the Greek letter mu, not actually a u] = micro = 1 millionth. 1 mbtc is a dollar right now.) then it's gonna be some weird amount of euros.

Yeah, even though he's the one earning the money, that doesn't exactly give him the right to cut her off whenever he feels like it. Presumably they've agreed that she's going to do other things for the family aside from working, and has planned her own life accordingly.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:03:16
Thanks, I will.

This is probably the single greatest threat to the success of bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:13:01
If you want to invest in altcoins, invest an amount that you're willing to lose completely, find out how to store it, and let it sit.
The problem with them right now is that they're too easy to manipulate; the largest holders can influence the market simply by throwing their own weight around, and they end up making a killing off of people who don't know what they're doing.
But if you were to buy, say ten dollars worth of each, and in the *very* unlikely event that one of the altcoins ends up supplanting bitcoin, most of those investments will go to zero but one of them could potentially be worth thousands.
If you try to play the market every day you're just as likely to lose money as to gain it. Candlestick analysis doesn't tell you shit when the direction of the market is determined by a few individuals coordinating their buying and selling.

Come on man, downvote the guy if you want but don't be all douchey about it.
