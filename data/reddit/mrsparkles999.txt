I bought over 2 years ago. Still buying and won’t stop. I’m just stating my opinion. Is the being rude thing to compensate for lack of maturity or intelligence?

Trying not to be negative but last sell was withdrawing $1900 at $4969. Life is hard sometimes. But it’ll get better.

The decrease to $8k again is inevitable before 16k. I suspect another drop closer to the end of August/September.

Remember me, friend!
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:23:38
Lost my job and have to pull $2k out, this is sad.
@_date: 2019-08-13 14:17:36
Just sold .15 Bitcoin. Price should be rising soon now.
@_date: 2019-10-20 12:29:40
Why do you say this?
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:47:12
 Can I meet him?
@_date: 2019-08-02 09:13:49
Okay inevitable was overboard but I predict at least 9k.
@_date: 2019-08-19 00:51:47
poloniex yes
@_date: 2019-08-06 19:50:42
True. I just already struggled to keep it in there already. Why not struggle some more?
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:43:17
I know this isn’t a good question to ask(I’ve been in btc since May 2017) but the SEEMINGLY foreseeable future suggests that I should wait to buy more? And I know better than to play the market on speculation, (especially when you’re feeling confident)because that’s usually when you lose.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:41:31
So the best way to go about is transfer to hardware, and transfer it back to cash through.....not being sarcastic here
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:56:58
Also should I move my BTC from coinbase to Coinbase pro?
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:30:23
I am in a few weeks actually.
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:03:12
So we are headed for a decline?
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:26:43
Should I take a $5k loan out and pay it back when btc reaches $20k?
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:56:05
Part of my research is asking questions to real people, considering someone just told me not to use coinbase, to use a wire transfer.
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:27:33
What I do is based on what several-many (trusted people/sources) say.  Obviously(like everyone) I have my own beliefs and predictions.
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:08:10
I agree that nothing is for certain, but I assume most people n this thread believe btc will hit its mark. And I feel it’s a matter of you believe in it or you don’t. Am I alone here? Obviously no one is going to say bet on borrowed money..
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:33:15
Yeah... after it drops to 91k? ;)
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:51:49
I’m not bothered by it bc it’s low.
@_date: 2019-08-13 01:28:49
Now I just need 1 million redditors to tip me 100 satoshis.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:32:21
I was thinking once it hits 100k, the ROI % per month will decrease, in which time I can start a business(I know how amateur this sounds) and make my profits based on my work ethic. Do you think BTC will always increase like this? (Serious question)
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:09:43
Should I transfer 4 LTC to add to my .464 BTC?
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:14:04
If it’s not on Coinbase I won’t be able to sell it when it hits 100k tho
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:10:27
And bc I can get a 5k loan with a low interest rate lmao
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:54:36
Doesn’t seem like it would’ve been a bad idea now huh?
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:11:56
@_date: 2019-09-12 16:39:41
Appreciate vocabulary lesson! Good day!
@_date: 2019-09-10 18:15:50
What should I get to mine? Is it worth investing $5k into mining or would I be better off investing in BTC
@_date: 2019-09-12 16:02:36
@_date: 2019-09-12 16:05:38
So you think another drop before 16?
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:54:22
I know, but I don’t have a choice. Family first, even though I’ve been working years investing in bitcoin and know what I’m going to miss out on.
@_date: 2019-09-13 02:13:10
Assuming things makes you a bigger one. Understandable given the context, but I’ve found life is better when you try to stay positive.

@_date: 2019-09-11 15:57:26
Somebody tell me bitcoin is going to shoot up in the next day.
@_date: 2019-09-11 16:18:42
I don’t I’ve actually been holding out waiting for a jump to get out for the moment. Greed is a mf lol
@_date: 2019-09-12 16:19:58
About to sell, so price will go up shortly.
@_date: 2019-09-15 02:16:59
So you’re saying I should sell and wait for the dip! Gotcha
