If you really wanted bitcoin to succeed you would be supporting anyone buying at anytime (if they can afford it) who cares when people buy, as long as they are actually buying
@_date: 2019-07-08 01:29:32
I know that stability is good, but not gonna lie, it's pretty fun watching it go wild
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:58:25
Quick question, if you have the 24 word phrase to get into your account. That's not the same as having private keys right? What apps actually give you the private key
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:01:36
Let us know roughly how much it's worth (don't say exact amount) and obviously don't respond to any stupid redditt messages
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:52:49
No I would definitely brag about it if that was me
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:56:43
This is awesome, how many shops have you set up so far?
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:24:58
I really hope this is sarcasm
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:39:38
I meant PMs but fair enough
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:32:14
People like you are why Bitcoin gets a bad rep
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:59:44
Time to buy eth?
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:34:20
Who else bought within a week of 3.5?
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:47:23
It doesn't have to be large sums of money, Im a college student and started buying little by little about a year ago. I'm up to around .2 which is still far off 1 but I'm gettin there
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:14:45
@_date: 2019-02-06 13:33:30
I would also like to know if anyone has any opinions about this app
@_date: 2019-02-04 19:27:27
What makes you say this? Not trying to argue or anything just curious
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:57:57
Ok for example. Let's say December 31 bitcoin is at 50k, January 1st it drops to 10 cents. I do not think it is an accurate representation to say if in two years it's 20 cents hey oh wow bitcoin is doing amazing, even if say 5 years ago it was at 5 cents. Maybe you disagree, that's fine, just my opinion
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:49:08
No Im actually very positive. Ive been buying through a long time and probably average a price of around 4500-5000 maybe? Ive been watching prices for a good year before that too. Obviously people are happy with it. I'm just saying if you only looked at this sub you would probably not he getting an accurate representation on how it's currently doing
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:10:17
A better headline. I own a lot of bitcoin and really believe it will succeed at some point. But this sub is FILLED with people just cherry picking data and saying "oh look how well it's doing!"
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:08:38
While you're obviously correct. If in 80 years bitcoin is no longer used and is forgotten, it will still go to zero even with its inflation system
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:08:53
Yeah i get what you're saying, it's definitely a good point. Just seems like people here always pick the timeline as specific as possible. Like if from 12-3 months ago bitcoin was negative but dropped for 3 days and went back up 6 months ago, people will pick that specific date to go oh look we're up this many percent from that date
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:30:02
Anything that you don't need a government Id and selfie?
@_date: 2019-02-05 03:24:44
I think the best answer here is buy what you can. Whenever I have some extra money from a paycheck or something I'll buy a little Bitcoin. I pretty much look at it as if I'm spending that money and not getting it back. So if it dies, I'll be fine, but if it skyrockets then dope
@_date: 2019-04-22 01:17:42
Also 2 things, I'm a college student so tbh I shouldnt be buying any Bitcoin I should probably be paying off loans but whatever. And usually I'll just throw in a decent amount of money whenever I get a paycheck on top of that weekly amount
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:43:41
Good for you?
@_date: 2019-04-24 20:42:59
This is what I strive for. I'm at almost 0.2 right now. Being a college student I would say I'm doing a pretty good job investing it
@_date: 2019-04-14 02:11:46
Serious question, what's the best way to go offline? I would really not want just a paper wallet. I was thinking of buying a physical wallet thing whatever those are called. Any suggestions?
@_date: 2019-04-22 12:09:38
I don't have to pay them. But you're definitely allowed to put as much money towards them as you want. And it's not raining interest yet so for most people it would save them money to try and pay as much as they can durring school, even if they can't afford all of it.
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:51:48
Walked right into that one I guess
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:39:28
I mean I get paid around 250 every other week, but paying for food and rent and whatever else I need. It's still a lot
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:56:53
Is there something similar to this in app form
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:45:30
I honestly still have no idea what Reddit gold or silver is but I'll take it
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:21:07
What site is this?
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:41:02
I haven't sold anything yet, but if I were to guess I'd say I'm down 3-400. Considering I'm a college student that is a lot of money
@_date: 2019-01-02 22:01:28
This is the first I've heard of this, so if this is true and the exchanges don't actually hold enough coins then theoretically the prices should rise? Because they would have to buy a shit ton. Or what would the outcome be to this
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:32:54
While maybe not spot on, you were close enough
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:22:40
I didn't buy more then I can afford to lose, but it still hurt so bad to see the numbers for the down
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:49:52
Yeah yeah, every time bitcoin drops I see posts saying "this is it" I own bitcoin and hope it is but the reality is that no one has any idea
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:18:53
What’s bitcoin in won right now?
@_date: 2018-07-05 17:29:42
The story continues, someone made a response article 
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:27:18
New idea, everyone who looks at bitcoin in a different currency comment what it is and how much per coin
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:59:18
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:33:47
Anyone get a little extra in that drop?
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:28:16
To be fair he probably thinks about it every day of his life
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:43:28
Being a college student with very little in my bank account, all money is money I care about
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:00:44
Yeah not exactly, I'm not an expert by any means so if part of this is wrong I invite someone to correct me. But part of the way Bitcoin works is that everyone who has a "node" essentially has the entirety of bitcoins transaction history downloaded to that node (or at least part of it) this is to make sure every transaction is confirmed. While it's not like your the nodes say "Geoff gave bill .01 Bitcoin" it just uses wallet addresses. The part where it becomes traceable is when you transfer it out of Bitcoin into cash. It's almost more traceable in a way because you can follow the Bitcoin from wallet to wallet as far back as you want.
Hopefully this is clear enough (and is also correct.) If you really are going for annonimity I would look at monero. But if you aren't well versed on Bitcoin I would suggest reading about it. Lots of other benefits
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:54:28
Oh ok, as long as there's a way to get it back lol
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:36:32
Wait is that a real thing
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:49:59
I've bought three years salary over the last one month
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:08:43
Yeah I'm gonna end up doing this, I kept putting off getting a hardware wallet because I would compare the price of the wallet to just buying more Bitcoin but I finally realize that I have more then enough to justify one
@_date: 2019-05-26 12:52:36
Yeah I don't get Reddit, you asked an honest question to learn more about bitcoin and you get downvotes
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:51:12
Well first of all everyone can afford Bitcoin, if someone wants to support crypto they can put anything in. Secondly that was a metaphor I am doing fine
