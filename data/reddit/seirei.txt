Yes I said now. 8 MB solved the problem for at least next year. And they do up to 32 MB. I'd bet that would easily hold up until new solutions are built. 
There's been a lot of talk of people in poorer countries that actually use Bitcoin for its intended purpose. And if we can use something else, why would anyone come back if those other solutions are doing it just as well?
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:37:29
Segwit hardly solves anything and LN requires at least 100MB blocks haven't you read their whitepaper?
And that's ignoring all the scam that LN had build into. Are you seriously ignoring that?
Bitcoin Cash is here to stay and it'll prove that big blocks are way less of an issue as core of trying so desperately to make people believe.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:26:54
If they work and continue to work, why come back to BTC at all?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:53:04
There was a 2 year run up for it to happen and then it got canceled even though the current problems have existed for over a year. Why would that change now?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:59:44
You're trying to make a point, yet you refuse to call things by their actual names. Why do you believe that this makes anything you say believable?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:27:58
Yes in 2013. According to the bottom of your list it takes 1.8 seconds to reach 50%. Where's your chart for 8 MB? Because I won't just accept 'multiply by 8' with improvements like graphene on its way it's hardly gonna be an issue anyway.
And we need solutions now because people started to depend on bitcoin as a currency and once it stopped being one they got shafted. So no, I'm not just relaxing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:11:44
Wether you like it or not, bitcoin cash has a solution that works. And it's the solution that was intended from the very beginning. And even if it turns out that 1 GB blocks are unsustainable, at least it'll give us time to find a working solution. We need a fix right fucking now, how is nobody in this sub understanding this?
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:54:04
Wait and see. Next year will be big for Bitcoin Cash wether you like it or not. And one the number of transactions overtake BTC we'll see who's right.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:51:41
Then the truck will just be bigger. There is no limit to this.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:30:59
I'm actually with you here, I hate to point fingers at the ones that lost money, their fault or not. If gox hadn't fucked up everybody holding BTC would probably be a lot happier at the moment.
But on the flipside, if you invest bigger sums on money in anything I guess it's fair to assume that you do your research in the thing that you're investing and the exchange that you use.
@_date: 2014-02-11 08:48:25

He's been working for a bigger provider vor PC security software for a few years now.
I'd had to ask him what languages he actually knows, but as far as I know it's quite a few, I know that he's very good in ruby and pearl for example.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:39:05
Point taken. But please don't think I'm coming out of the blue and just go at this to build a rinky dink exchange. If I'm doing this I want to do it right. We're still at the very beginning and I don't see why I shouldn't ask for opinions. 
It's not like this is a very serious kick-off meeting because we're launching tomorrow and we want to know if we missed something and need the help of an online forum for it.
@_date: 2014-02-08 04:13:04
Just bought more. What's your point?
Also, is it just me, or ist the article flawed on all fronts?
*"Bitcoin prices plummeted late Thursday and early Friday morning after one of the crypto-currency's biggest exchanges halted trading."*
Did Mt.Gox really halt trading completely? I thought they just halted the BTC withdrawl.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:41:02
I guess that was a bad choice of words on my part.
Alls I want is to gather opinions. As I already mentioned, we're at the very beginning and I don't see why it's a problem to ask around a bit beforehand.
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:57:59
I love how you write so much text without actually explaining how you make more money. Are you using the money you earned to buy good that you modify and sell for a higher value? Currently it sounds like it to be honest. Can you give us a short rundown on the transactions so far? It sounds interesting, but I really just don't get how you get from point A to B.
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:54:36


Well now since that didn't work out I think this guy lost all credibility.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:27:38
I won't just stop because someone told me to, but I'll take all you've said into consideration.
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:44:01
Wasn't the price fairly stable after the april 2013 crash when it hit the 100$ mark and stood there up to october?
IIRC the price didn't move for more than 10$ up or down at any point until it skyrocketed to 250$ and then up to 1000$. And since the last crash the price hasn't been this stable.  So I'm calling BS
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:53:07
While it's tempting to deposit 1000€ and just buy 10BTC, I don't want to take the risk that I'd probably never get them out of there.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:46:47
4474.266369160003BTC stolen?
Where do the '0003' come from? I thought bitcoins is only dividable by 8 digits after the comma.

I should learn to knit. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:10:01
I have to play devils advocate here.
Whatever happened to 'Never use any money that you can't afford to lose.'?
Seriously, if you're greedy enough to ignore this advice I'm sure every sane person would tell you that you're the one who fucked up.
And this comes from someone who has all his savings in BTC. I'm just as dumb as the people who left their money on Mt.Gox, but if it goes wrong I only have me to blame.
@_date: 2014-01-15 01:26:10
Would you mind to share your thoughts on the possible outcomes of this debate in China?
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:22:48
Finally a bit of actual advice. Thanks for that. The last thing I want is that this starts off half assed.
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:19:18
I'm interested to see which lucky asshole gets 25million$ worth of bitcoins and what the price for them will actually be in the end.
Not that I had a chance but is the auction US only or can anyone bid on it?
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:30:28
My friend actually is an experienced programmer and I've also got good connections to a lawyer, so we're off for a good start on that one. Thanks for the mentioning of these licenses, I'll specifically ask for stuff like that to be properly prepared.
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:00:57
That last one, tho.
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:13:12
I knew someone would call me out on that. But still I really don't see the price crashing down at this point.
And wouldn't 'by fryday' mean the deadline is on the start of friday?
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:31:55
Yeah I was expecting stuff like this to be honest. This isn't really a kick-off meeting with my experts, just a general look around to see why this might be a bad idea.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:49:19
I'm currently at work and just bought a few mBTC.
It's the best I could do. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 11:24:02
That's actually a very interesting idea.
@_date: 2014-01-10 11:33:30
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:18:07
Then so be it, I don't want to do this unprepared.
If it takes so long for us to get a stable basis, we'll take our time or let it die.
@_date: 2014-01-17 20:15:36
Oh that makes more sense, okay nevermind then.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:29:17
One thing that I personally like is transparency, so if we start this off, I hope to disclose as much information as possible (not of the users of couse, but if something should go wrong I would like to avoid the Mt.Gox way of blaming others).
This should be a good step in the right direction when it comes to trust. I'll keep this in mind.
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:16:07
Yeah but why not keep a backup, run off to someplace where they can't get you and then transfer the bitcoins to another wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:11:17
Customer support is important, yes. And I hope we can be very transparent about what we do. Most exchanges seem to lack this ability and it would be nice to fill that gap.
And I already know a bitcoin friendly bank that based close by, so setting that up shouldn't be the biggest problem.
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:51:13
I'd love to know how abysmally low the chances are of breaking all blocks straight in a row for one day.
That said. This would theoretically be possible on a CPU if you're lucky enough and it 'guesses' the right hashes wouldn't it?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:01:16
10.000$ per satoshi! To the ^m^o^o^n^!
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:00:06
'Never spend more money than you can afford to lose'
You clearly ignored that advice considering your reaction.
You were aware of the risks and you lost. Mt.Gox fucked up, yes, but your actions were just as irresposible.
@_date: 2014-01-25 11:27:10
Should've exptected that someone somewhere already explained it. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:10:27
Can we get a tl;dr version?
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:21:30
But that'S 4 words now. :/
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:47:53
If this wouldn't look like the drawing of a 5 year old, this would actually be a nice attempt. A horizontal version of it would make a gread header for an article.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:39:27
My only problem with this 'crash' is that I don't have any money left to buy more coins.
@_date: 2014-01-14 13:58:20
Is this limited to bitcoins?
I thought I give minig coinye mining a try, just for shits and giggles. This would be handy in this case.
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:27:40
Actually it does, a bit. This is indeed very interesting. Do you already have plans for the 1btc buy?
@_date: 2014-02-08 04:14:35
And this is new how exactly?
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:50:09
All, except Dogecoin.
Much future wow
I'll see myself out.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:42:42
1/10 nice try but since you did everything wrong that you could. I think you're trolling.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:12:59
If I wait and the price actually gets pushed down I'd lose even more if I sell my coins, where's the logic here?
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:06:45
I've already warned the programmer. :)
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:20:30
What exactly do you want to know?
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:59:39
I have them currently in the exchange of my trust. I know that this is the wrong method but with all the bad news floating around (the ones where people fuck up and lose their coins) I don't trust myself with securing my money.
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:46:25
@_date: 2014-01-23 10:04:55
I always have a little bit of BTC on my phone. So if I should ever run into a store that lets me actually spend bitcoins I am prepared. And I would probably buy something, even it I don't need it, just so I can say 'I've bought something with bitcoins today'.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:56:32
Good question. As I already mentioned, we're in an early planning stage, so we're still able to implement anything. Currently I'm thinking about low trading fees, but that'll most probably not enough for some people.
But if you've got some good ideas or requests we'll think about it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:02:33
My current problem is that I would currently sell at a loss, but I actually need the money or else I won't be able to pay my rent this month.
What clever tip do you have for this situation?
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:58:18
I might be able to pull that off, but only barely. How do you expect some random Joe to do that?
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:42:43
I thought silk road was taken down?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:55:41
Looks like I'll just sell as much as is needed sometime tomorrow and hope the price rises a bit until then. If not, that's the game I signed up to when I bought my coins. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 11:25:32
Just FYI,
these aren't mine. A fellow redditor posted these a few days ago and shared them for public use. Sadly I'm currently at work and I can't look it up, but it should be easy to find anyway.
But I agree. They are very nice pieces of art.

@_date: 2014-02-15 01:09:07
One thing just hit me. If I buy low and sell high I get taxed the shit out of me. But if I buy high and sell low I don't get anything back.
Taxes are bullshit.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:16:36
True, my expertise in running a company or even an exchange isn't the best, but I have to start somewhere, right?
As I said, before I'll actually commit to this I want to make sure that I'm prepared. I won't just go online tomorrow and just hope for the best. I'm actively looking out for people that I know and that are well experienced in their respective field to help us out. The last thing I want is to go in unprepared.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:59:25
If 1 BTC gets you into the top 0.3% I should probably always hold onto 1 at the least. 
That's good to know, thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:10:51


Considering how angry you've got it seems like you've lost a lot of money. On top of that you are trying to blame others for your irresponsibility. 
With all the bad rumors that were surrounding Mt.Gox it was only a matter of time until something like this happened. 
Anyway, Mt.Gox isn't innocent either. They are the ones that fucked up and caused this mess.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:49:34
* see something you want to buy
* add BTC funds according to the price to SR
* wait until your funds are accepted
* buy the drugs of your choice
Isn't one of the pros of bitcoin that it has fairly fast transactions speeds?
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:01:08
Someone accepted my buy order at 500€ when the price was at 640€ on bitcoin.de. I just left the order in because the price was going up and it would've expired a few days later anyway.
The dumb thing about it is that I bought btc earlier when the price was a bit lower. Now I have nearly all my money in btc thanks to that. Which would've been great if the price kept rising, but currently it's leaving me a bit uncomfortable.
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:52:59
As long as peercoin are the pennies and digecoin is the fake monopoly money that somehow is still worth something, I'm fine with that idea.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:05:34
For now we want to see how far we can get on one, but I guess we can't get around having a few more. Mt.Gox was a fairly big exchange, if we would ever reach this level I'm certain that we'll also stock up on programmers.
And if we start to grow bigger maybe my lawyer friend will join in full-time.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:33:01
I wasn't talking about OP alone. Many people lost money on Mt.Gox and some are probably in some deep trouble finanvially, because they've gambled.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:36:03
That's still in the air. But I'm open for suggestions.
First of all we want to build a stable functioning framework. We'll have some time to come up with somthing clever.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:49:40
After what happened to MtGox it can't get that much worse, so there's nothing to lose.
^^^^I'm ^^^^just ^^^^kidding ^^^^btw.
On a serious note, I was expecting that I would get a lot of negativity for this thread, but I really don't get why people assume that you're atuomatically an 'amateur idiot' just because you're asking around a bit. 
It's not that I won't ever be capable of making good business decisions after opening a thread like this. I just lost this ability forever now, so better go out into the wilderness and live under a rock.

@_date: 2015-02-26 11:58:38
That's why I'll always hold to 1 BTC. Just in case the value goes ballistic. I have still hope for it, you never know.
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:04:38
I had a buy order open for 500€. When the price went up I thought I just take look for a cheap sell order and bought 2 coins for 530€. A day later when the price was at 640€ some idiot decides to sell out on my open order of 500€ and I've got 2 more. Now I have way more invested that I feel comfortable with and the price is falling.
I don't feel very comfortable with the amount of fiat money I've got in BTC at the moment.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:57:04
Well it's fairly safe since it goes through the site itself. So I won't be worried about being stabbed. My worries were just if someone would use an opportunity like that to cash in on the money I send him and then never verifys that the money reached him and leaves me stuck with no BTC and a bunch of money less.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:04:57
That's why I'm considering to put in a bit more money now. Quadrupling 200 bucks is nice, but with 500-1000 it's getting interesting.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:39:25
while I like that, I guess it could become a bit confusing.

I'll consider buying one. Thanks for the quick answers.

And also a big thanks to you for taking the time and writing a great summary of everything that was said!
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:28:17
My problem was that I left a buy order open after I bought some coins. Who would've thought that someone would buy 2 coins 140€ under the current market value (at that point). Well and I didn't want to get into trouble so I had to crack up my savings.
Good thing I'm single. Otherwise I would have another person applying pressure and pushing me into bad decisions.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:07:11
I would actually love to lose the decimal places completely and just have something like 'credits'.
Oh and while we're at it. Wouldn't adding decimal places reduce the value of an individual coin? I guess you could argue that you will have more coins at that point.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:46:47
Is there an r/peoplewithtoomuchmoney? I'm also wondering why someone would put so much money on the line in one package. Wouldn't smaller tests with 50$ or 100$ be a better way to see if your money will come back to you?
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:33:32
I'm by no means an expert and this is jut a humble opinion of your random joe, but I would guess it's still in the 'technology trigger' phase. Bitcoin has only been around for roughly 3 years and it has only now become somewhat popular. So far I haven't met a single person that said "oh yeah that's such a cool thing" when I mentioned bitcoins. I usually get weird looks of disbelief. So it has to come a long way untill a really broad spectrum of people have even heard of it, but I would say we're getting there quickly.
This is, if you would say that the 'plateau of productivity' phase is the point where it has become a fully integrated currency that's accepted nealry everywhere.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:31:36
I'm in the same boat. I'd be glad if I had sold at 700€ but I won't sell now. Someone on this subreddit once said to me 'never catch a falling knife'.
It's actually a pretty good advice for this kind of situation, I think.
And in the worst case scenare you can rest assured that you weren't the only idiot that thought holding would be a great idea.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:37:45
That'd be 20.000.000$ in 4 years. These guys made the same amount in 3 months.
That's a siginificant difference.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:07:59
That's right, and I'm actually considering to buy a bit more now.
The thing that's bugging me is that my father send me an article about [The European Banling Authoriy warning on bitcoins]( and begs me to sell before it's 'too late' and that 'it'll crash soon'. And shortly after the price starts slowly plummeting down.
I want to hold, but stuff like this doesn't make it very easy. And the fact that I overspend a bit doesn't make it any better.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:54:08
Most likely his age.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:46:48
I can't be arsed to read the whole thing, but if the price of bitcoin of related to the co2 emmision than I see a crash in the future.
It'll be like this:
* bitcoin price rises further, making many people rich
* most of them buy big expensive cars with a big co2 emissions
* the overall co2 emmision of the world rises and the percantage bitcoins take up is lowered
* bitcoin price will fall into oblivion
See? Everybody can make up bullshit. And my version is shorter and easier to understand.

It's meant that you shouldn't sell when it's already falling, because it could turn around at the second you do and you have to buy in on it's way up.
I speak from experience, this can happen.
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:40:44
Since yesterday this is my strategy:
* I've bought bitcoins. 
* I'll hold them until the price is a point that seems high enough for me
* I'll sell them at that point
* ???
* profit
I'll also buy new ones when the price should go down.
I tried buying and selling on a short term basis when it went up and down. And after that failed miserably I switched strategies.
I also would like to hear opinions if this is a good decision.

@_date: 2013-12-12 17:18:45
You answered your own question already.


Once more sellers accept bitcoins the price will rise further. This has happened and is happening right now. The limit is up for speculation, but seeing how big is is with such a small market around it. I could see the 10k$.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:38:05

@_date: 2013-12-16 19:15:45
That's encouraging, but a funny incident made me overspend a bit more than I otherwise would have. That's what makes me so uneasy about it going down. And the money was usually intended for something else.
So I could cash out all coins when it's time to buy the thing I wanted, or I take a loan and wait untill the price rises so that a fraction of my coins can pay it off again. Either way makes me uncomfortable and I know that the later could be potentially a very bad idea.

No amount is actually too low. It's just a matter of what you can affort to put on the line. The more you put into it, the more you could get out in the end. Just remember *'don't invest more than you can afford to lose'.
As to how much it's expected to rise, that's anybodys guess. Nobody can predict where it'll one day.
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:59:19
I was wondering that myself, but I guess miners could live from the coins they get from the transaction fees.
I would imagine that if bitcoins become a global thing the sheer mass of even the tiniest amount of BTC would make the mining worth it. 
Can someone more enlightened tell me if this is a correct asumption?

According to everybody on this subreddit MtGox is the devil and Bitstamp and Kraken ar the promised saviors.
I really can't give you a whole lot of informations. So far I just used MtGox and while I like the way the trading works (say you have 200$ and want to buy BTCs at 600$. you just have to say 'buy 1 BTC at 600$' and it buys as much as it can from your 200 without you having to type the exact amount in. That's really nice if the numbers aren't as even as in my example) I haven't seen this on other exchanges I've used so far.
But apparently withdrawal takes a long time (never done it so far) and I hate how they charge you for adding fiat to your account.
Hope that helps a bit.

Actually it isn't, but that isn't really the reason why I may be interpreting it differently.
Either way, as I said, it makes sense for me, and I have hopefully explained the problem itself well enough that the quote isn't necessary anymore.

Yeah, I quiet liked Bitcoin 24 as long as it was running, but the big difference is, that it was run by a 23 year old guy who totally underestimated the while thing as it seems.
His accounts were closed back in April and many people feared for their money and started to take legal actions against him.
Having a site that is backed by an actual bank really helps with the trust after experiencing what happend back then.

Whenever anyone is asking about mining, I usually have one advice. Take the money and invest it directly. the chances are better that you make a profit out of it. If you don't want to commit too much, just spent as much as you can affort for yourself and that you wouldn't regret to lose.
You may be regretting your decision to not invest more in the end, but if that time comes, ease your mind by knowing that you didn't overcommit.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:34:56

@_date: 2013-11-22 22:59:16
That is actually the best explanaiton so far. the question is, what would happen if there's only 1 BTC left. I mean we were talking about bitcoins dissapearing forever. So sooner or later this would be a realistic problem. I guess the market would constantly adapt to the ever smaller pool of coins and therefore it would all even out. Actually in that case it would all come together logically, sweet. That was all I wanted to know. Thanks!

@_date: 2013-11-23 04:49:42
It would be silly to not buy at this point.
Just take a portion of money that you can affort to lose in the worst case scenario and invest it. Even if it's just 0.1 Bitcoin you can make a profit. At that point you wish you woul've invested more, but up to that point you'll be thankfull that you didn't put any money in, that you couldn't afford to lose.
It's not very likely that the Bitcoin will crash to 0 tomorrow, but on the off chance it does it's better that you haven't gone overboard with the investment.
Just my 2 BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:46:42

I bought in with around 230€ after the drop in april. Much gambling and bad decisions got me shortly to 400€ and now back to a rough 260€. It's not too bad since it's a fairly small sum and it's mostly just a game to see how good I am at guessing. So far I'm still in the plus. Its just always so mind numbing to think that, if I could've foretold the course exactly I'd easily be at above 2k right now. Oh well I'll probably just stop speculating and buy in at a point that seems right, wait for it to grow and then cash out on numbers that I determine for myself upfront. I guess that way I would've been better of by now.

You're completely right. If you're starting now, mining isn't going to be profitable.
But I'd be interested at which point the mining itself will stop. And, since the difficulty is variable, if there will be people stopping their efforts and therefore lowering the difficulty. If that's actually how it works I'm really interesting to see how it developes.

The fact that coins can just disappear makes me wonder if we might run out of bitcoins at some point.

So what will happen when we run out?

This may be a bit off the point you're trying to make, but I have to admit that it was a slight obstacle for me to accept that I'll be just buying 0,7 BTC and not a whole one because I didn't want to spent 450€ but just 300€ (rounded for convenience) It's still a good bunch of money. It's not a real problen, but when you decite to 'buy a coin' it's weird to just take a fraction.
I guess this will become more interesting once 0.001 BTC is worth 50$ considering you'll be dealing with a tiny fraction of something very valuable. I mean you could get a nice pair of pants, but you buy it with something  that would feel like a few cents. Imagine this in a world where bitcoin replaced every other currency. You'll be like "Back in the day something like that woul've cost me 50$, but now it's just 0.001 BTC".
I remember how my parents always compaired the price of goods to the old 'Deutsche Mark' when we got the Euro.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:44:33
I don't want to point the finger and say "haha your own fault", but it seems like it is just that.
But on the positive site you now have more than 7 BTC. That's a good bunch more than I have and I'm sure you'll be happy with it once the price goes up again.
Just don't get yourself trapped in a loop of "oh man I could have a 500$ more at this point". I made that the last few months when I made a dumb decision and it's really not helping you in any way.

@_date: 2013-11-22 21:13:54
I don't know if you have it where ever you are from, but here in germany every price lable has to have the price on a compairable unit on it.
For example. Let's say a company sells it's milk for whatever reason in a) 1,25 litre packs for 5€ and another company sells them for b) 0,75 litres at 3,30€.
Both price tags will have their equivalent price broken down to 1 litre on them. In this case a) will be 4€ per litre and b) would be 4,40€. So even though the 3,30€ sounds like it'll be cheaper on first sight you can still easily compaire the prices without even thinking about it. I don't see a reason why this couldn't be done here.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:49:53
It'll go up again just endure it. I made the mistake of selling 3.6 BTC after it crashed down to 58€ back after the mini crash that happened after the crash in april where I bought for around 56€. If I had hold onto them I could've sold them without a problem at 600€. Instead I gambled on highs and lows and I'm sitting on 20€ profit.
Just my 2 cents.

Panic selling was what made me change strategies.
I'm totally aware that the price may already be at it's all-time-low and will maybe not ever be lower as it is right now. What I meant was, that I'll buy when I have the disposable income and the price is at a level where I think it'll be higher, later down the line.
This won't make me a millionare, but I'll get a few easy bucks out of it in the long run, as long as the bitcoin keeps climbing up.
I'm talking in a months/years schedule here, not days or weeks by the way. It's just my long term investment since it's most probably more profitable than putting the same amount of cash into a bank account. 
At least as long as the bitcoin stays strong and doesn't crash do zero, which I guess won't happen anytime soon. And if it does I'm richer in experience.

It's been going down for the past minutes. Can't you read the signs?
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:12:07
Short answer: No
Long answer: Noooooooooooooooooooooo

I won't bet on it to drop to 100$ but it's dropping right now. I'm just in no place to speculate on how far it'll drop, though.

I'm really getting it too. I just tried my best to buy and sell on the tops and lows. And then on my last move I evened out and now I'm right where I started...
I'll probably just buy when I guess the price is right and then leave it be for a while.

How does it not hold up with the quote?
In a way you try to sell early enough on it's way down in hope it'll drop further, but also hoping you catch it before it hit's the ground. If you're too late it'll come back up again and you sit there with bleeding hands and you have to quickly buy back in at a loss.
Anyway, for me this makes enough sense, and even if it's not a good quote it helps me to keep a keen mind in these situations.

That'd be putting them in the oven for 20 minutes right?

I only regret not selling at 700€.
Oh well, now it's time to play the waiting game.
I'm off to the gym and when I'm back you better have fixed this mess.

Wow that hug looks awkward.
This is the first time I see bitcoins being accepted here in germany. Too bad it's on the wrong side of it...

Honest question:
How does one ensure that you don't record all the private keys and run away with the money? Isn't that a possible problem here?
And I won't take 'trust me' as an answer. :)
