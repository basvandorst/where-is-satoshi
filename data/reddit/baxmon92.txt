As you don't hold the private keys, they weren't "your assets" technically. Yet they pretend they were so they can apply their haircut without having to touch their own funds.
You've been Finex'd. They're borderline criminals, I've said that before.

What about bitcointalk or bitcoin related forums?
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:54:11
In light of the Bitfinex hack, could you list all the services where you used the same Username at the time?

Lol yeah stamp was hacked but due to a proper hot/cold wallet system the losses were way more benign and none of the customers received a haircut. They handled it with grace. Fees aren't any higher than Finex's either.
[Gonna leave this here](


Reliable exchange my ass. In recent history they showed a complete lack of proper management multiple times.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:34:53
Honestly, prove it.
@_date: 2016-08-12 19:02:36
This. So much this. **If**, after all shit that happened at Bitfinex past months, where arguably it's been proven by default that all those mistakes originated from inherently flawed and faulty management, **you** still want to trade there, then who's *really* at fault here?

They made countless mistakes past months, one of which twice in a row within 24 hours (the halting and then very messily restarting the trade engine with no front notice). What exactly is your point again?
@_date: 2016-08-08 11:32:55




Doesn't have to be complete or conclusive to still be evidence ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:55:47
Interesting. 
**Can everyone who got a similar e-mail from Kraken around that time please list below on what other services (including bitcoin forums!) they used the same Username at that time?**
By elimination and some statistical analysis we should be able to determine if this could've been Bitfinex or not.
*Edit// so far (ok ok, n=4 but still) everyone who got the Kraken mail had the same username over at Bitfinex.*
*Edit// Ok, thats 7 that received that mail (one told me through DM), ALL of which had an account by Bitfinex under the same name. Only one had an account on Bitcointalk under the same name. The evidence is growing stronger.*
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:44:52
With the amounts of mismanagement they showed that month, this was simply a disaster waiting to happen. And it did.


I got all my active trading coins out of there that same day, and boy am I glad I did.

It's evidence alright. Circumstantial though. Just no *proof*.

When you say **"your timeline is massively skewed"** you ought to give an accurate one yourself. The facts do not speak in your favor:
- People were unable to withdraw BTC (or any currency) during the times the other exchanges slipped the most, that's between **21:15-0:00** yesterday and **10:15-13:45** today. That's 2:45 and 3:30 hours, two separate occasions within 24 hours where people were unable to withdraw funds and trade/protect their assets on other platforms and **no warnings were given** that the exchange would go offline due to stability issues.
My questions to you:
How did you manually handle liquidations and stop-loss?  
Why was complete clearing of the orderbook not considered?  
Especially on the second occasion, where the shutdown was **planned**, why didn't you give advance notice and allow all active traders to withdraw funds so they can utilize them elsewhere in the meantime?
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:55:02
I'm fine with having Bitcoin, just not with keeping them at Bitfinex for trading.
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:59:43
My post or Bitfinex' actions? Lol...
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:02:04
So tell us what did happen. Where were these stop-losses executed if not at the price they were set at? Or were they removed altogether?
@_date: 2016-06-21 22:22:53
Obviously all those exchanges didn't just close randomly at random times without prior notice. See what I mean?
@_date: 2016-06-21 10:03:17
If you ask me they're doing this on purpose as part of an orchestrated dump where they will profit from directly.
They are not even allowing coins to be withdrawn in the meantime.
Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on you. I'll be getting all my coins out of there ASAP. They showed their colors - a bunch of crooks.
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:09:18
I remember the Mt. Gox one, that sure was fun. However, Bitfinex dropped the ball not once but twice the past two days. You can't possibly implement the same solution as the one you saw fail horribly only 12 hours earlier.
You cannot honestly think that a moving market while you're online, triggering stop-losses upon re-entry, would be a good way to go when you're the biggest exchange - **only to do it twice within 24 hours**
Any regulated exchange would be ended on the spot after such descision.
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:11:47
Dumbest thing I've read this year. Without speculators the coins you're Hodling wouldn't be worth much at all.
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:06:03
I'm sorry for your loss, I got out of MtGox about a month before withdrawals stopped. Welcome to MtGox 2.0 though! Double the leverage, double the fun!
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:48:40
Yeah, as in, mere minutes. You should've given active traders proper advance notice, like 15-30 minutes, both by twitter and a notice on your site itself so traders busy actually trading will see you're sutting down for a while and have the chance to withdraw before you do. I was caught of guard. I was looking at the exchange page, and only noticed that suddenly the orderbook stopped moving. Refreshed -&gt; maintenance notice. That is not acceptable no matter how you try to spin it. 
**If I'm on *your* site using *your service*, you can't reasonably expect me to check *Reddit* or *Twitter* regularly to see if you're shutting down anytime soon.**
I'm honestly not sure in what world that would be considered acceptable.


I'm asking you how you did this. Did you cancel them? Execute them once enough liquidity was in the book? And if yes, at what point? For instance, a stop loss set at 680, was this later executed at 650 anyway?
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:58:22
The way in which it was done is abysmal though. If you've got to be offline for a longer period of time, and the market moves in the meantime, **you clear all the orderbooks** and start from scratch (like Bitstamp did when they had issues), and allow people to move their funds elsewhere in the meantime if they want to.
@_date: 2016-06-24 21:16:18
Lol cheap article "Bitcoin is up 15% in 24 hours!!!", yeah only after being down &gt;30% in the 2 days before.
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:34:38
If you were able to withdraw BTC between 21:15-0:00 UTC yesterday and 10:15-13:45 UTC today, I'd like to see proof, as I was actively trying to connect to the site at both timestamps and got the "maintenance" page, thus unable to withdraw anything. Would be quite a scandal if users were selectively allowed to withdraw...
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:51:21
I have accounts on other exchanges, but if I'm trading on Bitfinex and am holding a BTC position there, I can't liquidate on other platforms if Bitfinex doesnt allow me access to my coins.
