No problem! Glad to help how I can. 
1) I’m not actually sure, but I’d imagine you can only transfer USD -&gt; USD to your bank, so price drops wouldn’t matter for withdrawals, right?
2) much much much less!

Same issue here. GDAX wont let me move any currency but of course I can send the BTC I have in my Coinbase wallet, as long as I pay their nice fee :).
All my BTC purchasing from now on will be through my Gemini account, and I'm going to be moving my crypto off Coinbase to my new Nano S.

Ok, so let’s say I transfer $100 from my bank. I now immediately have $100 USD to play with on Gemini, and I can use it however I want on Gemini, let’s say to buy some BTC. So now I have some BTC and USD sitting in Gemini. However, until the initial $100 USD deposit is officially approved by the bank and Gemini (~5 business days) I can’t move anything I bought with it off of Gemini. 
This is great if I want to buy in at a certain price and now worry about missing a dip.

I only do ACH transfers with Gemini, and they pre-credit them so you immediately have the funds to buy, but you can't transfer anything you buy/sell off the exchange until the ACH transfer fully clears. I'm not sure about Paypal.

Thanks for the advice, I'll take it into account. I don't really have large sums of Bitcoin so I guess a third-party is ok for now.

I'm looking forward to it!

Very new to Bitcoin here, I have about ~$13 worth that I got for free for signing up with a student email address on Coinbase. 
Why shouldn't I leave my wallet there, and what can I do with a paper wallet (will its value still grow)?

What is wrong with blockchain.info?
Funny enough, I *was* on Coinbase and my friend said something along the lines of, "...get off Coinbase, get on blockchain.info!" haha.
I'll check out Trezor and ANX though, thank you.

Ah ok, so if I made a paper wallet I would essentially cut ties with Coinbase and it would be more secure (no copy of my private key would be on the internet) and if I wanted to utilize bitcoin fully I would have to add it back to an online wallet?
@_date: 2014-06-24 15:38:05
Ah ok thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2014-11-21 16:35:59
Ah ok, thanks for that.
I have another question, are there any Bitcoin-buying sites that you are aware of that allow you to purchase Bitcoin with a debit card?
@_date: 2014-11-21 16:31:27
Haha thanks for the advice.
Did you happen to print out your copies on computers not connected to the internet? I've been reading a lot of that...

Thanks for the suggestions, I'll check out Breadwallet.
So the two paper wallets you print are the same wallet, just one is a copy, correct?
