This was not always the case back in the early days litecoin was often call a shit coin for segwit support and lack of security because of said segwit implementation. The litecoin hate was strong, first mining pool I was part of was hacked "for supporting a shit coin" this was 4 years ago almost so lots has changed since then

Coinbase is decent for a first purchase and if you are planning on holding your btc there longterm or doing a single free transfer (by transferring it to gdax first and then moving it to your own wallet). 
If you are wanting to buy other coins with said btc it might make more sense to buy ETH or litecoin for a faster transaction time to another exchange. All depends what what your long term goal is.

Bitcoin stopped being centralized when ASIC's where made for SHA. There's 1 company making ASIC's to mine bitcoin and somehow you can claim its still decentralized.

Ahhhh nice the good ol only respond to one part of the response. Those coins will never be cashed out on an exchange. And I dont think anyone is going to buy bitcoin from the Address where nicehash's money went to.
As for finding out who is actually linked to the address is harder, but they still found DPR and hundreds of others who where actively trying to hide themselves.
I would be very surprised if FBI/NSA weren't tracking and analyzing every transaction on the blockchain.

I've accepted them but you have to accept they are in no way decentralized.

That's quite the statement when you can literally see how much every single user has in bitcoin and where and how he acquired those bitcoin. How is that anonymous or private?


Like I understand the sentiment but your government can also say you have no right to live in our country if you don't follow our laws. And seriously the government already controls it, there's no way to cash out of bitcoin without an exchange and those require personal identification.
I guess you could say you plan on replacing fiat with bitcoin entirely so you'd never have to exchange it but transaction fee's make that impossible at the moment.
 So I guess the government can't do anything if you just hodl the coins forever but if you ever wanna actually spend them good luck keeping the government out of the picture and not paying taxes.

Decentralized ASIC mining. Is that a joke?

Pretty much everyone I know buys ETH up here to trade into BTC. The exchange rate is just better compared to BTC so its cheaper to buy ETH than put on a US exchange and buy BTC than it is to go straight cad to BTC

Hey well at least he didn't generalize an entire subreddit by the actions/responses of a small group. 
Sure he seems to like calling people paranoid at least he's doing it on a case by case basis and not simply saying all people who subscribe here are crazy and paranoid. 
You tell me which one is "better" but idk about you I always try to resist stereotyping individuals it tends to bite you in the ass more than being helpful these days.

What happens if all the hashrate still goes to 2x tho? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:32:58
They've been telling us this for years. When will the technology catch up to the astronomical rise in fee's?

There was one tho he was killed for reasons.

Actually I'm pretty sure you could find twice as many articles saying bitcoin is a scam so clearly bitcoin is twice the scam iota is.
Incas ya actually need it /s

If the vegetables are poisoned you simply don't agree to eat them you wouldn't eat them and later change your mind. Just seems weird how everyone was supporting segwit2x up until segwit locked in then decided the 2x part wasn't important.

Holy shit this changes everything

I think the idea and concept of a blockchain is what makes bitcoin so valuable especially considering its the original and first. However I also have been using bitcoin infrequently for the past 6 years and have not exactly seen a crazy amount of progress and fee's have only grown, which I don't believe is sustainable. And yes I know solutions are being worked on but I wouldn't say it's impossible for some other blockchain application that might not even exist yet taking over.
I guess this is just the view of someone who uses bitcoin to transact and never really hodl much so I understand not all people feeling the same way about fee's.
All I'm saying is I'm scared there's a possibility something else might take over one day at least for my use case of bitcoin, which is trying to transact some sort of value reliably, quickly, safely, cheap and verifiable

No one has a claim to the bitcoin name. The community decides what is or isn't bitcoin.

I'm not sure I'm asking and this response isn't very helpful. :(

Wasn't segwit part of that agreement as well however? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:28:24
I'd definitely agree that it's the most popular blockchain by far at this point in time. However I could see it going the path of AOL browser or Myspace.
I'm hoping however that's not the case.

It seems to discredit bitcoin cash. Or Bcash. Idk should we be able to call it coin or alt coins when there aren't even any physical coins. /s
But seriously this shit doesn't accomplish anything let them have their fun over there if it truly is as bad as everyone says it'll fail no matter what.

Considering mastercard uses their own block chain now I'd have to disagree with that statement. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:57:59
Ummm I'm not sure where you got the idea that fee's are centrally set but as far as Im aware this isn't the case. Fee's rise just like bitcoin when lots of volume on the network and drop with no volume. So dynamic fee's as you say. The network doesn't simply grind to a halt. You just need to pay high fee's to get quick confirmation.

monero doesn't seem to have any issues.
