Ok 1 question then. You think LN will improve decentralisation or not? Apart from the miners-problem. Just as a tech, will it improve decentralisation? Tell me the cons of LN from a belieber point of view then, so I can decide myself. Im not interested in the positive aspects that much as I can see those. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:56:27
I apologise for being informed as well as I thought.

And because these hubs act like a middle men. Why cant we have onchain? In 100 years they will laugh about 1MB blocks anyway. So increase of those has to be part of the solution as well. But now they just implement a off-chain and patented solution for a problem they created themselves? Seems very shady to me.. and when you follow the money.. banks were too late so this a way to get more grip. Pumping premined altcoin and selling for btc is also possible. I think for me LN is making BTC one of the most risky investments and is a direct attack to free society. What are your concerns with LN as a believer?

Because the companies invested in the patent(s) regarding Lighting Network. But don't mirror my question; please explain why this is the best solution? Don't any of you see concerns regarding hubs locking money? of old-boys-money being pumped in from the top? But we'll see. I never hold a lot of Bitcoin because I never liked it after segwit and this 'improvement', but still. This is bad for the whole cryptospace, as we are now just rebuilding the real financial world, but then virtually. Same with the internet; now we got content-barriers (like country-borders) and stuff. But please preach how much more freedom we experience in our daily lives.

What if biggest nodes are getting shot down?
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:59:06
Don't these hubs act as banks? This feels wrong on all levels for me.. While it is propagated as improvement.. Please teach me how this is good for decentralization and the future of this particular cryptocurrency :)

You guys know you are being hypocrite by bashing Bitcoin Cash right? Damn Im even more sure that I made the right choice by investing in real working coin, instead of fanboy coin (bcash/bitcoin) Please get more mature as you guys are damaging the community just as well as those other fanboys do.

Let him diversify it in other coins as well, like Monero and Ethereum. Or let him wait out the dip which may never come.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:07:29
And this subreddit is helping. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:37:12
Bitcoin is owned by banks.. dont think Bitcoin cash is better though. Please stop the fanboy bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:33:32
It harms the wholy community. Its the same with FIAT money.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:03:13
Thats true haha
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:45:22
Start by reading the paper about bitcoin then!
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:45:26
I seem to think the dad wants in for the mid-long term. Then other promising and more mature cryptocurrency can be a good alternative.

Why is this about skin colour again..
