You are giving *way* to much credit to some folks. From what I have observed over the years there are two sides. The educated, peer reviewed, methodological and ideological approach vs. plebs hoping to get rich in the second coming of Bitcoin jesus. The latter disregarding any rational thought with regards to real life tradeoffs and unique value proposition of the Bitcoin protocol.

You came here completely illiterate to any subject tangentially related to Bitcoin and you have apparently learned nothing. 
The concept of decentralization that matters for Bitcoin is the decentralization of full verifying nodes.
You heard this buzzword and want to "decentralize the development" now. Bitcoin core however is an open source software project with hundreds of independent people contributing code, code review and reseach. There is nothing central about it. 
Blockstream doesn't control core, core doesn't control Bitcoin. They work on improvements and the community either accepts or rejects them.

@_date: 2016-11-29 09:12:08
Because people started to realize that not only mining is suffering centralizing pressure but full vaildating node count does so too. People capable of rational thought have come to the conclusion that one simply can not store the worlds cash payments, settlement transactions, machine-payable web, smart contracts, micro payments,  etc.  on a redundant decentralized ledger, without a great deal of centralization.
Bitcoin devs have decided to not repeat the errors of the internet/email and build a robust decentralized first protocol layer, upon which more efficient layers can be added. Hal Finney had realized this necessity as one of the first people. Back in the day and within the limits of the knowledge available, he saw semi-trusted 3rd parties backed by Bitcoin as a possible scaling solution. Today we know that paymeny channels and constructs such as the Lightening Network can significantly increase Bitcoins throughput while remaining trustless and decentralized.
Unfortunately most discussions are bejond the scope of lesser minds (relative to Hal Finney) and lesser minds seek simple solutions. Therefore you have a brigade of people, motivated by the thought of becoming rich, spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt while promoting what they believe to be the easiest way to increase Bitcoins throughput (Just increase a 1 to a 2, 4, 8, 20, ... etc! who cares about tradeoffs? I want my 2 Bitcoin to be worth one million USD!).
Be happy you have missed out on the debate. It has been ugly and useless so far. The community is fighting over something that either way won't scale Bitcoin to any extent.

@_date: 2016-11-30 16:20:13
linear improvement of throughput is right down there with quasi constant (log n) and constant improvement. calling any improvements to the protocol on those levels "scaling" might technically be correct (if you want to seem pedantic) but it's still asinine. that is if the goal is to make bitcoin 'global, main stream, peer to peer, electronic cash, with close to 0 fees! hurr durr'. 
lets call it what it is. the debate contributes nothing of value at best and will grind development to a halt at worst. People seriously need to reevaluate what the fuck they are actually doing here.

@_date: 2016-11-24 23:38:25
Scaling is something that requires more than a single update. So imo the question is missleading. There's a road map from core for scaling Bitcoin and that road map (which can be considered 'cores current path') does not exclude hard forks.
Change the question to 'current short term scaling option' and it would clear things up. Even though SegWit+2MBHF isn't on the table and it's laughable to call BUs approach "scaling".
@_date: 2016-11-18 00:12:55
As expected there is **no research** what so ever in that document suggesting a 4MB today would have a negligible effect on decentralization.
The paper **assumes** 4MB (extrapolated from a 2012 study - avg. blocksize 87KB) to be an upper bound for the underlying infrastructure of the Bitocin protocol and continues to dabble in other hypothetical reparameterizations and their effects. It also comes to the conclusion that reparameterization will not solve the scalability problem.

no need for big changes. Bitcoin won't scale to anything through blocksize increases anyway. we'd need 40MB to facilitate (1tx/person)/day for just 10m people (0,00015% of the world population). at that point the only people running nodes are the 3 miners left in china.

SegWit increases the "block weight". 
Because signatures within a transaction make up &gt;50% of the used space, segregating them into another data structure allows for more transactions to be put into one block. 
SegWit however was originally meant as a malleability fix and overall protocol optimization. "Increased block size" was only **one** of the many beneficial side effects.

It's not a huge red flag because the type of decentralization that matters in bitcoin isn't the "decentralization of development". It's the decentralization of nodes in the Bitcoin network.
Illiterate users who have no idea what Bitcoin is, no idea what OSS development looks like have conflated the issues.
Blockstream doesn't influence Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Core doesn't control Bitcoin. We the users of the protocol choose which software we run. Bitcoin Core publishes improvements they believe to be in the interests of the community and we either accept them or reject them.

That doesn't change only because the original Bitcoin network is valuable.

Using a historical pattern to extrapolate future growth is ignoring the fact that certain parameters are hitting physical limits.  
Bloating blocks to 1.6GB over 46 years has absolutely no significant "scaling" implications. 1.6GB would facilitate 100million people making 4tx/day. Even 50 years down the road BU numpties will be bitching about not being able to buy their coffee with bitcoin lol. What is guaranteed however is the centralization pressure of increasing block size. That is an axiom. Who ever does not agree with that rationale should rather spin his dreams of unicorns and candy cane somewhere outside of technical debates. 
For that reason increasing the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is the absolutely last measure to be taken, **not even anywhere close to** the first. But that is some sense you wont manage to drill into plebeian heads.
@_date: 2016-11-18 19:24:54

If you think Bitcoin can on-chain scale to anywhere close to those I have a bridge to sell you. Even Hearns plan was to reach Paypal scale in 25 Years, VISA in 50 years from now. You won't be tipping a driver on the blockchain ever. The IOT can not use the blockchain because every vending machine, every fridge and toaster would want to post every twix it buys and/or sells on the blockchain. 
I wish people would get it through their scull. Anything short of a technical QUANTUM LEAP will **never** facilitate proper on chain scaling and hoping on a miracle isn't what the developers of Bitcoin are inclined to base their protocol designs on.

The answer is a clear no. Increasing the blocksize parameter will result in older clients rejecting blocks larger than 1MB. There is no way of changing that and this is the fundamental difference to SegWit. SegWit when activated will not directly cause conflict with old nodes.

Their mistake, as with most educated people, is that they believe reason will prevail. The people working on the technical end of bitcoin are part of the intelectual elite. There is an unbridgeable divide between an acomplished cypherpunk and a pleb who joined Bitcoin when he saw Ver in 2013 posing infront of a lambo insinuating "if you buy bitcoin you will be rich too! (we just need unlimited block size!)".
If SegWit doesn't activate I forsee chaos. Bitcoin itself will disolve into the sea of shitcoins surrounding it because the bastion of ideological reasoning, that has been driving it forward, will have been neutered. People will happily start "decentralizing" development (as those who have no idea about OSS call it). Bitcoin's network effect will deminish as developers quit (after all we rejected their work) and or scatter to work on different incompatible implementations. 
Bitcoins adversaries win. They have managed to cut the head of the snake leaving an incoherent mass of plebs similar to the occupy movement shouting, rambling and complaining without a clear purpose or any solutions.
Somewhere in the gigantic dust cloud there will be a few people left holding on to what bitcoin once was. They are the cockroaches fighting for decentralized personal financial sovereinty. They don't care about what the price of a Bitcoin is. They care about the idea. To them Bitcoin is priceless.

Bigger blocks do two things:
**a** They increase the 'cost' of running a full node (space, latency, bandwidth, computation)
**b** They increase the  (tps) Bitcoin can handle
The problem is that the tradeoff between a and b is quite shitty. Increasing **b** will yield a linear increase in  (next to nothing). While at the same time significantly increasing **a**. 
2MB blocks would double Bitcoins throughput from ~7tps to ~14tps it would also strain my bandwidth usage to its limits. I would be borderline excluded from running my own node for a measly increase of ~7tps. Anything above 2MB would prohibit me from running my own node and I live in one of the economically most powerfull western countries on this planet. If I can't validate my own transactions and I have to trust someone else to do so for me (SPV) then there's literally no point in me owning bitcoin.
Some people haven't understood Bitcoins value proposition and think it's not an issue if Bitcoin becomes a slow and shitty version of paypal (Ver's acolytes). Other's are aware of the centralization pressure in areas such as mining and validation and are very conservative in terms of block size increases.

then a user sending a transaction from an old node might never see it confirm because his node doesn't know about extra rooms. This is would enable double spends and fork the network in a very ugly way. 
Now... if we started talking about putting some less important "baggage" into those "spillover rooms", et voila! We'd be talking about SegWit.

The block size as determined by the legacy code remains the same at 1MB. 


Is in quotes because while the block size limit remains the same, the desired outcome many people seek when increasing that limit is an increase in  SegWit achieves the same goal just in another way. Transactions can be slimmer, therefore you can fit more into one block.

not quite sure what you are babbling on about, but i understand the protocol and it's implications quite well and simply increasing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE does jack shit to improve its "scale". If anyone wants to alleviate some perceived bottleneck and improve the protocol they can upgrade to SegWit. Otherwise I'm fine with Bitcoin as it is right now. 
Bitcoins value proposition is priceless to me and I am willing to pay much more than a few measly cents for a transaction to be stored on the first global, immutable, distributed and trust-less ledger on the planet (5/15/50 USD and I'd still pay it).
@_date: 2016-11-22 14:35:23
Personally I believe that Bitcoin is a far grander marvel than anyone has ever attributed it being. Considering human stupidity, I would have expected xt, classic and BU to all have succeeded in recruiting enough imbeciles to fork the network over and over. Yet here we are and Bitcoin is still the bastion it has always been. Stupidity might slow it down but it will never reign over it. Marvelous...

If SegWit doesn't activate I don't foresee Bitcoin going anywhere. If the community can no longer come to a consensus there is no point to continue developing anything else as that will only end in gridlock too.
Bitcoin dissolves into the sea of alt-coins. Interest will drop, price and hashrate drop. At some point a charismatic leader will manage to rally enough people to achieve a contentious fork, further splitting the network. 
Blocking SegWit will neuter Bitcoin Core and without a proper driving force Bitcoin will remain irrelevant (think occupy: No goals, no suggestions for improvements. Just incoherent rambling and protests from all sides).
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:39:54
Well your point is pedantic and incorrect. So yes, technically even if the Bitcoin protocol had only 1 functional node left on the network. It would still be (from a design and implementation perspective) decentralized software. 
If you have a problem with the common interpretation of the concept of "centralization pressure" then substitute all occurances with "network health". Because if *you* personally can't verify the blockchain but have to trust others to do it for you, you have missed the point of Bitcoin. Also try being less of a contrarian. It will make life easier for you.

You missunderstood me. The ground shattering event wasn't the hundreds of USD one BTC became worth. It's the fact that it became worth anything at all. The revolutionary aspect of Bitcoin is that it finally offeres individuals on this planet the option to EXIT the financial power structure many of them find themselves in. 
Bitcoin will struggle to match that achievement in the future. If you believe that the majority of complacent plebs in the west will ever use the BITCOIN protocol as an underlying layer of their commerce I have a bridge to sell you.
@_date: 2016-09-17 15:39:22
I don't feel inclined to disagree with you. But that's probably because we have another definition issue with regards to the premiss of your statement.
 I'd also prefer two groups to continue with their own vision rather than having development getting stuck. 
Last time I checked the latter isn't the case. So I don't see the need for the former. 
I'll be blunt. If Bitcoin development and governance resembled anything close to the shit-fest / temper tantrum most shillcoins display, I'd much rather join Mike Hearn on his R3 ventures than give a damn about crypto currencies.
Changes to Bitcoin so far have been made based on thoroughly peer reviewed code. The governance model is a meritocracy. The individuals involved have a long ideological track record which aligns with privacy and personal financial sovereignty. So far all alts are no better than onecoin. They promise a lot and deliver nothing truly better than Bitcoin.
 I'd just wish all these toxic ****s would take their ***es over to Dash, Ethereum, etc. instead of constantly brigading the Bitcoin community with their asinine and illiterate doomsday threats.
@_date: 2016-09-03 07:20:52
the point
@_date: 2016-09-15 17:10:21
Cons: A transaction on the 1min chain requires 10 confirmations to be as secure as a transaction with one confirmation on the 10min chain.
More overhead in block propagation.
Higher orphan rate.
More frequent forks and therefore potential for double spends.
Pros: ??? 
I assume you'd like to read that this helps the "scalability" issue... it doesn't. Leaving aside all pitfalls, this leaves the Bitcoin protocol with a one time linear capacity increase.
@_date: 2016-09-19 10:31:11
That's because I havn't deluded myself into thinking the entire world will be using Bitcoin in 2050. It has massively taken off within its target audience. 
Bitcoin's value proposition is individual monetary Sovereignty. 99% of the American population is illiterate as to what that actually is or why they would need it. 
@_date: 2016-09-27 17:03:10
Obsolete: no longer in use or no longer useful 
For Bitcoin to become obsolete something superior has to replace it. Meaning another crypto currency has to exist that has a better value proposition than Bitcoins (reminder: decentralized, trustless, permissionless, uncensorable, private,  proven track record for store of value, etc).
I don't have any particular emotional bond with Bitcoin. It's a tool that serves a purpose. If a better crypto currency exists, why should I care about Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-09-19 13:41:08


Just because tech in the past has limited us from landing on the surface of the sun doesn't mean we can't land there tomorrow. Just because creating a secure backdoored encryption (master key) method in the past has been impossible doesn't mean we are unable to do so tomorrow.

A user has the choice to use dogecoin, litecoin, etherium or anything else he pleases. It's not about choice it's about consensus. A long adjustment interval aligns incentives in such a way that a high degree of consensus must be achieved to implement a change.


I guess you are right. That's why I added


scaling without improving the architecture comes at a tradeoff the majority of bitcoin users clearly has rejected.
@_date: 2016-09-15 16:50:33
Continously readjusting difficulty created the whole ETH classic debacle, because mining the 5% chain was instantly profitable. This "feature" will most likely never make it into the Bitcoin protocol as it's not anti-fragile.
A few seconds for each block with auto size works as long as no one uses the blockchain. It does nothing to solve the scalability issues of a decentralized, trust- and permissionless ledger.

@_date: 2016-10-17 22:06:53


I'd say yes. But that can't be fixed since no one knows how such an intricate system will exactly turn out to work. 
The specific parameters will have to arrange themselves organically and the community will have to tackle problems as they arise. 
The things I wonder about:
There have been simulations for routing payments but they don't guarantee things will work on a large scale.
What mechanisms do we have to oppose a disproportionately large amount of channels closing at the same time?
**Adressing your block size/fee question:** The latest block contained somewhere around 1500 transactions. The block reward was 12.5 BTC. Meaning the current block reward could be replaced if all transactions had a 5USD fee. Probably around tree fiddy with SW and even less with future block size increases.
I'd obviously hope that network security doesn't remain at the current level. But I don't think there's a reason for concern on that side of things.
