It'd be exceptionally hard for David Kleiman to post that since he was dead.

I'm sure that the criminal syndicate hopes the same.

I assume it'll all become clear in a week or two, either way.
EDIT: 
That said, bitcoin people acting strange is no real shock to my system.  Being paranoid or awkward is not out of the realm of possibility of a guy who at one point never wanted to be known. My last LocalBitcoins seller rode up in a car with an InfoWars sticker and a 9/11 Was an Inside Job bumper sticker, and requested that I refer to him as John Galt , and used a challenge/response code from Atlas Shrugged.  
That Satoshi might handle an unmasking awkwardly when being pressured to do so by multiple media outlets ready to break the story if he didn't is not something outside the realm of believability.

Oh, you won't get paid for awhile.   THEY get paid, and the content provider gets paid, and you can decide the percentages.   You can also pay to remove ads entirely once they get their ad servers up and running. (per site, and that money goes to the sites)

The thing that gets me is that I see people telling non-bitcoin users it's instantaneous.   If you're going from fiat to bitcoin to other user, it's NOT even close to instantaneous if you've not done it before.  You have to set up accounts online to buy the bitcoin (or through some third party seller), they have to send you the bitcoin while you send them the fiat.  The money clears, and you get the BTC, and then and only then do you encounter the "transfer" issue / "wait times."
Telling people who don't use bitcoin generally that it is instantaneous transfer is a bait and switch and only makes bitcoin look bad.

Well, we'll have to wait and see what they do.

It's not wishy-washy in the slightest.
If the argument can be made that Satoshi's private key is not enough to identify him and verify him, then the same argument holds that we cannot verify statements allegedly from Satoshi after the whitepaper.

Your time hasn't been stolen, you chose to pay attention to this.  That was your choice.  It wasn't something CWS took from you.  Take responsibility for your own actions.

But when mining profits literally all get cut in half, who stays, and what does that do to hashrate?

Welcome to the reason why people use pseudonyms.   All you know about Satoshi is what WHOEVER Satoshi is wanted you to see (be it CWS or a team or someone else.) 
You don't really know a person.  You know a constructed identity built for a specific purpose.
@_date: 2016-05-24 20:14:23
This is not true.
The store only takes the hit if they did not follow the proper procedure in signature/taking the card.  Otherwise, the credit card company takes the hit.  
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:23:01
When you fund your debit card, you are doing an asset exchange for cash.  The card uses USD as it's basis, not BTC, so you will generate taxable events on each load.
@_date: 2016-05-02 16:57:00
True, but it's been long accepted that Satoshi is a nom de plume, and the only way Satoshi has communicated is electronically.  So , what's to say that someone didn't steal Satoshi's key early on?  What's to say that Satoshi really was the one who communicated all along?
The only evidence we have of Satoshi, the only way we can verify who he is, is by that privkey.  Whoever has that, thus, has to be Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-06 20:07:35
And I agree, if that was his intention.
But running around screaming that he committed fraud isn't true.  He might have been STOPPED from committing fraud, but he didn't COMMIT fraud.
@_date: 2016-05-04 22:57:18
I don't get how people would "expect" Satoshi to act.  If we're hypercritical, we only have one document from Satoshi, a white paper in which professionalism and technical speak was prevalent and expected.  If we open it up a little, we have his talking online, which was very similar to how Linus Torvalds acts in his dealings with Linux.  
I think people are superimposing their own beliefs and biases about what Satoshi would act like (and whether or not they believe CSW is Satoshi) on this.  I don't think anyone can really speak for how Satoshi "would act" save for those who knew him personally.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:56:22
My long term point is, then we don't know if anyone's Satoshi.  We have the whitepaper.  Everything after that may or may not have been Satoshi.  It's largely, thus, irrelevant who Satoshi is at this point, since we have no way of identifying him (or her, or them, or ..)
@_date: 2016-05-06 19:56:09
Yes, but "could haves" are not grounds for fraud.  Fraud is COMMITTED action, not what someone COULD do.  Speculating on what CW would do as Satoshi Nakamoto is irrelevant without evidence.  He could go on a grand donation spree giving tens of millions of {insert currency here} worth of bitcoin to poor children too.
@_date: 2016-05-07 04:33:06
You are missing my point.
CWS wasn't stopped because of the blockchain.
He was stopped because he didn't have credibility.
Pretending as though bitcoin is some sacrosanct non scammable currency by uttering the word "blockchain" flies in the face of almost all of it's history.

I somewhat doubt many people here have actually operated a business with a merchant account and dealt with things like this.  I'm not saying it's all sunshine and lollipops, and "buyer protection" chargebacks are a separate beast that get more intricate, but yeah, the whole point of dealing with credit card companies is because they take the risk.  That's the whole deal, that's why a business owner allows them to replace cash in their store.  
Again, it's by no means perfect, nothing really is, but this belief that merchants are being forced to pay for fraudulent actors and suffering huge financial losses?  Just not the way it is.   From my experience, stores lose more to internal shrinkage than they do to fraudulent actors and credit card companies making the stores "eat it."
@_date: 2016-05-04 23:08:16
Personal suspicion is someone found out CSW (or a CSW confidant) was Satoshi and was going to sell it to the media.  Everything after that can be explained as just rushing to meet threatened publication deadlines.
@_date: 2016-05-25 14:51:55
Yeah.  That's one of those common misconceptions.  Writing "Ask for ID" or "show ID" isn't enough, and that's a way a customer can dispute a charge.  Usually in the signature line, it says "Not Valid Unless Signed."  It definitely says that in the cardholder agreement.  Simply having "SHOW ID" or "ID" or whatever in there means the card is not a valid card.
EDIT: Oops. I see you said that.  My point is, that's one of those areas where a charge can actually be disputed.  Because the merchant took an invalid card.
@_date: 2016-05-06 19:07:31
Fraud requires a victim and a loss. 
Who was the victim, and what was the loss?
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:41:47
Right, but the only way we've ever proved Satoshi is Satoshi is because someone with the key says he is.  Unless you're saying that , at any given time, the person who signed their speech with Satoshi's key might not have been Satoshi.

Brave is basically taking the ads from the web site, and replacing it with ads from their servers, and then selling it back to the original website.
It's an awful methodology and will just cause people headaches.

On a side note, since everyone brings up Trendon Shavers / Pirate.. 
Shouldn't he have been sentenced and stuff?  He's not in any prison I can find lookup information for, and he kinda just went away, yet he still supposedly has access to coins.
@_date: 2016-05-24 20:13:15
You're incorrect.
When you walk out the store with your receipt , and the store has one that has a confirmation number on it, that's the confirmation.  That's it.  The store will get their money if they followed the validation/identification rules for the card. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:21:31
If the statement that "the private key doesn't prove someone is satoshi" is true, then yes. Anyone could have grabbed his identity at any time.   Interestingly enough, he didn't publish a key in his white paper, just the gmx email address.
@_date: 2016-05-24 14:56:29
Checks are still backed by insurance depending on the payment provider/bank the customer uses.  And in most places, checks require two forms of identification, which means passing a bad check is an awful idea since if you supply phony/fraudulent identification you've likely committed a crime on top of passing the bad check.  Further, nowadays, checks can run almost as fast as debit cards with instant authorization and access (again depending on your bank, their bank, etc).
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:59:00
Hasn't it already gone to $3000 and killed banking as we know it seven or eight times?

They have to prove it, and they rarely do because it's almost impossible, and it's up to whatever your merchant account contract says.  Most I've seen is 90 days.   Only time I've ever seen them deny payment was when a manager overrode a credit card decline and "HOLD CARD" from the company.  Most everything else, even fraud, they just pay the store and write it off/go after it on their own dime.  
That's WHY merchants use credit cards and pay the 3% or whatever.  Because the credit card companies assume the risk for you.   
I get that maybe bitcoin can have something like that in bitpay, but then you're comparing apples and oranges.
@_date: 2016-05-07 02:29:10
Works perfectly fine for me.  I guess you don't know what you're doing, and that gives the appearance of it being broken.  But it's not.  
@_date: 2016-05-07 02:50:20
Dunno.  I don't even know if I like the idea of them replacing ads and taking a cut.. that's the only way the "we get paid" part of it comes into play.  It's trading who gets to track you.   It's not "solving ads", it's a third party injecting themselves in and basically giving websites a choice:
Either we get a cut, or you get nothing.

And how long did MtGox fool bitcoin?
Or any of the other scams?
