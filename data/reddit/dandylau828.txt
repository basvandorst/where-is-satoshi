Ya go on with ur sarcasm. Diversifying in investment is no secret. N I’m not here to offer solution to bitcoin but just to tell my personal experience n view about it.
Ive started to buy some bitcoin in July with close to zero knowledge about it because I wanted have the real experience of it). Ive learnt about the value of it n the power of Blockchain since then. That’s well before all the crazy speculation hype takes off. Till I became a strong believer of the future of cryptocurrency, I think it’s time to share with people who are closed to me about this. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only two that are easily accessible in Malaysia with fiat. What I’ve shared is my sincere impression about the experience. U can take it however u like. I’m only trying to point it out n see what we can do about it.

Pls tell me if I’m the only bitcoin believer but purchased n experimented other coins too. I think I must be a narrow minded person if I haven’t check or try out some of the top ten cryptocurrencies, to learn about their uniqueness n features that are not available in bitcoin yet.

So true.

Good title and content. Just don’t agree with the part about altcoins are all trashes. It’s a good remind to others not to invest recklessly, but do ur research about other cryptocurrencies, guys. All of them are using Blockchain, bitcoin/ethereum as protocol, but with one exception, IOTA. N some are very interesting development if u care to spend some time to understand them. don’t deny the value of other altcoins simply because they are not the first or not on top of the list in coinmarketcap. They r not simply a copy paste + little extra stuff. Bitcoin being the first one doesn’t necessarily mean it will be successful. Think about Facebook (just an example though), it is never the first social media, but it’s no doubt very successful n being widely adopted.

Ya people like u had earned enough not to care about the 0.001 BTC fee for one transaction, because u don’t care about more than half the population of the world who haven’t heard a word about cryptocurrency or bitcoin. 
Think carefully about the scalability and sustainability of it. Imagine urself from a country whereby ur currency is 10 - 20 smaller than USD, it is unusable for real payment with such a fee locally. It will only stay as store of value like gold. People say gold can’t be used for payment because u can’t cut it into small pieces n use for transaction, that’s true. But bitcoin’s high fee will be the reason that makes it have the same fate like gold. 
I’m still having a great hope about Bitcoin, though all other altcoins came in to disrupt it’s growth. Something just needs to be changed.

Should have posted the photo as proof together with post. Never expect this kind of reply about the news is fake. Go n try it urself if u will.

How is future trading of bitcoin going to affect how bitcoin is being perceived? Some say more volatility, some say stability and it will become more like a currency than before. 
I’m totally a newbie to this. Only started to learn about trading when I start to buy some bitcoin. Can someone explain a bit about this?

Bitcoin is the first use case of Blockchain. People trust it and it’s comparable with gold now. It has became the reference for all the cryptocurrencies being introduced later because it’s the first. 
Those recent hacks on exchanges have nothing to do with the fundamental of bitcoin. In long run there’s no impact at all when people understands more about bitcoin and Blockchain. 
The analogy for this is simply like a bank gets robbed, the money will not devalue. It’s the problem with the security of the bank, nothing’s wrong with the money itself.

People are too used to debt based credit. It’s hard for consumer to give up that. Yes it affects the cash flow of business but consumer care more about their own cash flow.
