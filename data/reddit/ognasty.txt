I support the community organization  which you can read about here:

When the US Government accepts it for tax settlements.

I may do more in the future, but that sounds a bit too difficult.  Although from all the downvotes it appears this isn't something the community wants to encourage.

You could invest in something that is already a great idea.  For example, NastyMining is currently looking for investment to build out a solar array to help offset mining costs.  Any investment would also get you access to proceeds from any of our coin sales, which have been over $50,000 this year alone.  PM me on bitcointalk.org if you're interested.

I hear OgNasty on bitcointalk.org is a popular escrower.  ;)

An agreement has been reached with SunPower® to provide 29 of their E20 327 watt AC Modules in order to harness a green energy source for NastyMining operations.  SunPower was chosen due to being, "widely considered the best solar manufacturer" with "the best solar panels on the market" and "stellar 25 year warranty."
Going solar continues to establish NastyMining as a values-based and ethical operation, assisting NastyFans to serve as a public beacon of socially responsible Bitcoin activity.

The problem with manipulating the market for profit is that it works until it doesn't. Look back at what pirate was doing to the market until BitPay stepped in and destroyed his manipulative short position. I imagine big fish are watching, and this snap the rope trick will only be successful for so long...

I don't have a gambling site.  I've never scammed anyone.  You have never owned 0.5 BTC in your life.  Get a life.
@_date: 2016-01-15 06:56:35
Hence why they are so mad that they have gone to such lengths to try and pull the wool over the Bitcoin community.  Unfortunately, they have failed miserably as their intentions were spotted well in advance and their manipulation attempts were laughed off.

As I am in the process of raising funds for a solar Bitcoin mining operation, I may have to look into The Sun Exchange.  
@_date: 2016-01-15 06:48:22
Developers thinking they can control miners is the most comical twist to Bitcoin yet.  So many sore egos coming...

It shows that his intentions are not personally motivated or pro-censorship, but that he is simply protecting Bitcoin from being overwhelmed by altcoin propaganda.  However, it is easy to spot the childish person in any argument.  He's the one that takes his ball and goes home.

Gorgeous coin.  I've made a couple gold physical Bitcoins (with unique features) and my next 4oz gold coin will definitely be pleasing to the eye.  Worth a look.  
@_date: 2017-01-10 08:52:29
True, but to a Casascius coin collector, these are the holy grail.  As a collector and maker of these types of coins myself, I'd easily be willing to pay double the gold price to own one of these.  Check out my take on silver Bitcoin wallets here: 
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:16:39
Very cool.  I am also building a solar array, although probably on a much smaller scale.  Any advice for others?

I use them to identify my physical coins in sequential order as well as make them easily identifiable on the blockchain.  It is also a great way to easily identify your accounts and stand out as a payment address to avoid others providing false addresses in a MITM attack.

You are getting an error when trying to be case-sensitive?

It takes a special kind of crazy.
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:19:52
Ya, you can get them as cheap as 1.3 BTC for a loaded 1 BTC coin on the bitcointalk forums.  The guys selling them (I forget) has several sealed rolls of loaded coins even.

Cool.  Everybody always likes coin porn.

You are confused.  You cannot generate my vanity addresses if you had a thousand years to do so.  I'm not saying to only look at the address prefix...
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:41:41
What security practices do you think could possibly guarantee this?
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:43:22
I think this is not true.  I'd love for you to post links though if this has ever occurred.  I'd be genuinely interested to look into it.

Don't take your coins through an airport.  Don't ship them without plenty of insurance.  Seems like simple enough rules.  They aren't exactly Gremlins.

NastyFans Minted Seats come with an engraved vanity address and private key.  The vanity address can be read in it's entirety on the back of the coin, and the private key is secured with a tamper-evident hologram.  Here's a pic of the back of one: 
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:57:11
Lots of gold/silver and they earn BTC over time!
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:53:28
I see your Casascius collection and I raise you the complete NastyFans Minted Seat Collection. ;) Much more gold/silver and they gain BTC over time! :D 
@_date: 2016-07-10 18:51:18
What part of "easily identify" makes you think not to verify the entire address?  Identify =/= verify.  Locks keep honest people honest...  Even if you use a non-vanity address it wouldn't stop someone from creating a vanity look-alike, therefore using a vanity address only increases the security by forcing a potential attacker to have to generate the prefix and also maintain a similar looking address.  I also use 9-character prefix vanity addresses...  It would be a lot of effort for someone to generate that prefix and also a similar looking address, not to mention our BTC distributions are automated so a MITM attack is impossible in our use case...  Surely it is common sense that taking an extra step only increases security.  Keep arguing with me though.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:27:26
No worries.  That's just a part of my collection.  ;)

No clue, definitely not silver though.  That coin is the ugly stepchild of Casascius coins if you ask me.  Doesn't fit in to any set.  I'd put it with the bars as far as desirability.  Not for me.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:53:11
Before I'm bombarded with any more messages telling me why I should pay to fix someone's cat's broken leg or pay for their grandma's surgery, the 1000 BTC coin is unloaded.  The hologram is intact, but the coin is unloaded.

Ya, I actually have a 5 (redeemed) and all the originals as well, but I only wanted to show off the complete gold/silver set, as I figured this is what folks would want to see. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:40:05
What is the metals cost on that one, $1 at most?  I don't consider that part of this set.  There's a 5 BTC and a bunch of bars besides all the 1 BTC and 0.5 BTC original design also.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:46:23
Some folks love those s2 coins.  I'm not one of them.  The stickers while important to be intact, are not what I'm collecting.  I've heard those s2 coins fetch quite a premium though.  Congrats to you for having the willpower to hang onto them.  Most wouldn't with those premiums.

4oz version now available here: 
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:49:45
The 2oz coins originally sold for ~$4,500 each.  If you are familiar with NastyFans and our seat structure that provides BTC revenue to the coin, you would understand why.  The new 4oz coins will most likely be in the neighborhood of $8,500 each.  Here's a thread if you'd like to read up on NastyFans to understand the project a bit: 
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:50:15
Yes, 50 I believe.
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:50:56
I had been repeatedly asked to do a gold coin for about 2 years.  I finally decided to cave in and create a batch of 10 of them.  They all sold out in advance of production.  If I see similar interest in a 4oz coin, it will also be a reality.  If you can't see the value in a combination gold/bitcoin investment, I can't help you.
@_date: 2013-05-27 04:13:29
I responded to both of your PMs asking you to contact nonnakip for resolution as I do not run NastyFans.org.  My understanding of the situation is that you didn't make the correct payment and your funds were returned to you.  I apologize for the delayed responses, I have been enjoying the holiday weekend here in the US.
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:56:51
I haven't posted this on Reddit yet...  Thought some folks might be interested.  You can grab these coins from NastyFans.org and for those that don't want to follow the link, here's the relevant information:
These coins are similar to physical bitcoins you see from Casascius and others.  I'll highlight a few of the major differences.  
First of it's kind!  Coins are tied to NastyFans seats and not preloaded with BTC.  By not preloading these coins with BTC, they are not only cheaper to purchase than their competitors, but the potential is there for the BTC address engraved on the coin to continue rising forever with regular NastyFans BTC distributions, as opposed to being a fixed amount as with similar physical Bitcoin options.  It's like having a Bitcoin miner with no costs or effort to maintain.
No more printed keys!  These keys are engraved, and forever attached to the coin.  Light diffusing material is inserted between the engraved private key and the hologram to help alleviate security concerns.
No more firstbits!  Your entire public key is engraved on the coin, eliminating any uncertainty that may exist about your coin's public address.
Sequential vanity Bitcoin addresses!  Know exactly what coin number you hold by the public address.  Each coin begins with 1Nasty and is sequentially numbered with the following two characters.  
Limited production batch!  Only 500 coins produced.  Being tied to seats instead of BTC also makes these coins extremely limited, as even if we converted every single NastyFans seat to a physical coin with future batches, only 25,000 could ever exist!
Profit sharing!  With 50% of sales being donated to NastyFans, this is a giant fundraiser for all NastyFans.  You know your funds are going back to the Bitcoin community and helping to support a great organization that is dedicated on doing good for Bitcoin.  It is my hope that these coins will provide happiness to existing fans, while at the same time exposing NastyFans to a new group of potential members.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:46:27
NastyFans.org will be refunding you our part for this error with tomorrow's donation distribution.  Good luck!

I'm also offering a similar but different product here for those interested in such things:

Tell me about it.  I was on the fence on whether or not to buy the gold 1,000 BTC coin.  I decided to buy a few thousand dollars worth of amazon gift cards instead.  I still toss and turn at night.  ;)
