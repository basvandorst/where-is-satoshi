If so there would be no disadvantage in introducing it to the protocol, but the advantage would be that **every** contributor to the network would get a share of **every** block. At present miners only get to share the blocks that their pools "win". There is an incentive to group together, creating increasingly powerful pools (which win more blocks). If it were part of the protocol there's only be one big pool including everyone, each making their own independent decisions about how much CPU power to devote to the task.
Although electricity costs make profitable mining on regular hardware impossible, there are other benefits - the health of the network and the sustained and increasing value of the bitcoins that might make it seem more worthwhile even if a very small share could be guaranteed; it's not all about immediate profit. After all, people contribute CPU time to Seti and Folding etc from which they gain nothing.
As things currently stand, one disadvantage of the current pooling arrangements is that the pool providers take a cut. Another is that transaction fees eat into small shares, making light contributions even less efficient than they might be. I think this is another deterrent to further decentralisation. If built into the protocol, pooled mining would be cheaper and fairer.


This is surely only true while the groups are smaller than the majority. And there seems no reason why mining pools should not amalgamate to the point that an individual pool controls most of the CPUs and would have overall control of the network and protocol. Even if they don't merge, they might act together through common self interest (e.g., increasing minimum transaction fees). Centralised control through the back door. A relatively small number of individuals with large BTC stores would be in a position to change the direction of the bitcoin system in their own interests which would not necessarily align with those of other bitcoin users (Average Joes).

Blockr.io is up to date (thanks @_date: 2014-03-14 18:35:06
If a pool mining protocol were incorporated into protocol itself (so that everyone running a node gets a proportion of the block reward proportional to the power they individually devote to mining) it would decentralize mining pools, so there'd be no incentive to group with other miners.

These articles are great. Thanks so much for writing them.

I was thinking about something like this. Add "mutating" element to the code and you would have a genetic algorithm. Ethereum would provide a good platform for this.

I like it but I am thinking that spending may often mean transferring coins from e.g., mining accounts to other wallets (rather than paying for other people's goods/services). As a newbie myself, does that make sense?

I can imagine it working up to the point of being a big part of mining and becoming independent of people.
I am no expert, but in a way this is a bit like what has already happened in the trading of complex financial products - barely anyone understands how/why they work and the profits they generate seem only tenuously relayed to any real-world productivity. Although there are still a few people involved the link between money and actual stuff is almost broken.

I didn't know about this, but yes, that is what I mean - except all nodes would run it, so all mining rewards would be distributed this way.

I think the maximum block size needs to increase because if the rate at which transactions arrive exceeds the rate that they can be processed the results would quickly be disastrous and difficult to recover. So I support this necessary and urgent change.
Like almost everyone else I think in the long-term the number of transactions the network handles needs to increase beyond the current block limit, and incorporating an adaptive limit would be helpful, and perhaps there is longer to determine what form this should take.
But although it’s necessary and urgent, I think the larger blocks will make it even harder for individuals to contribute to the network (undesirable), I think this is problem is part of a deeper and more long-standing issue which needs to be addressed.  The protocol as originally designed worked well when every participant was involved in providing the network (node), in mining (miner) and in transacting or investing (wallet). Since it became impossible to mine successfully on unspecialised hardware, these different roles have been decoupled, so that now the interests of miners are not necessarily aligned with those of nodes, investors and transactors. Only one group is directly incentivised by the protocol: miners. The provision of the network depends on goodwill, and the rewards of running a node do not come close to covering the costs. Many people would be willing as enthusiasts to run full nodes if this could be done without a huge loss and with domestic equipment, but as things currently stand they are really just subsidising the profit-making activities of miners, exchanges and so on. So there is a pressure to reduce the resources donated to the network. This is already the case, regardless of blocksize. Ideally changes to the protocol would have the effect of providing incentives to node operators. Merely retaining small blocks would not reverse this trend, so the problem is likely to come around again and again.

This is quite a good demo of what can be done (here emulating evolution of simple organisms).
Of course bitcoin GAs would be used to earn money rather than move about, eat etc. But the same principles could be used to evolve e.g., effective trading strategies or financial products.

When blocks are full, and fees rise, surely there will come a point when smaller bitcoin balances can no longer move them. E.g. it becomes unfeasible to move 0.25 btc if the fee is say 0.1 btc. So eventually small balances will be frozen and taken out of circulation?
