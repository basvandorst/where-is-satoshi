Shhhhhh - narrative in here - This is a coin that is made by Roger Verr and we hate him now...... 
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:39:28
If it convinced enough people to repeat my message I would.
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:38:30
Cool.... but whats bullshit about it? can you point me to a better article so i can get clarification?
If the witness data is removed, how does the inputs and outputs get verified?
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:04:34
Yeah - That's the attitude - You shouldn't care how this works - just trust us that it'll work and we won't see any problems.
I have a lot of trust in that top layer, but now I've heard from you that we shouldn't care i'm all hunky doorey.
I don't see why people have so much trouble trying to explain how with will all work - I'm probably completely wrong but this is my understanding - please alleviate my concerns.
Sidechains like Lightning network allow you to open these second payment layers, but opening and closing them will occur on layer-1 wouldn't they? 
So the only way to not settle on layer 1 would mean I'd leave my BTC locked up in that sidechain.
Gotta hope that there's more on that sidechain that I want to use my BTC for else it's back to the main chain.

Stop it, you'll ruin the narrative...
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:07:24




I don't understand how this is different from what i said - for lightning - you lock your BTC in the sidechain - use it as many times as you like and then settle on the Bitcoin layer?
Reading this it sounds like it's leveraging the 6 degrees of separation theory and that you will be able to make lightning networks to connect to every business through the 1 channel.
So that sounds pretty good - but also it says that everyone on the network must have the same ledger
So this confuses me - Does this mean that all lightning network will have a ledger/chain that's seperate to BTC but everyone will keep a record of the transactions here. 
So we have moved the data from BTC's ledger to a new ledger, but there's no miners to confirm the transactions here instead we use a central entity that is backed by multi-sig on chain transactions?

Yeah let's do a Twitter poll instead
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:47:50
Yeah, definately not in an information bubble here. This agreement was far to easy, let's all disagree again and make november a chaotic month. Looking forward to it!!!
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:01:40
Ah, so if people disagree then they obviously aren't familiar with cryptography.... Or they are trying to prop up asicboost, yup that's a good way to ignore any opposition.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:14:07
Lightning is ages away. Sure it's on testnet now but it won't be on mainnet for a long time. Meanwhile Christmas season will come and go and one Chain will have fast transactions and possible growth. 
The other looks like it'll be running so slow no one can use it.  Which chain is useful to you from a merchants perspective coming up to the highest spending time of the year?
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:21:21
By the logic applied, they'd all be fake nodes as well so should be banned to?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:02:00
Guess that's their view of segwit?
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:06:44
Lol, found this comment semi amusing from a technical perspective. Be mindful of the resources we use, nope Bitcoin mining doesn't use more electricity than could power a small city.....
Anyway i know irrelevant to the convo but amused me non the less
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:11:17
So obvious that it caused contention for many years.... You gotta be pretty ignorant to think otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:23:46
Yeah, I understand what a node is and why you would want to run one.  That wasn't what we were talking about though was it - If your gonna say all nodes are fake that use AWS then it doesn't matter if they run a Segwit2x client or a Segwit 1x Client.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:20:37
Sounds like using node counts isn't a smart way to work out community support......
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:21:48
lol - Wooosh!!!
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:54:46
Wait don't let that get in the way of the current narrative....
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:31:02
Or if there is a chain split and the other chain survives it will show that they learnt nothing from the Ethereum split and that they are happy to steal money from their customers.
Just because in your bubble you see no value in ABC doesn't mean others don't. 
I'm also not saying the chain will survive, but Coinbase deciding that they are just going to take your property because of their beliefs..... Sucks that your just so okay with that.
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:43:44
So you'd agree with me if it was the UASF at risk but because its the other camp's problem you disagree?
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:02:54
I was under the impression the BU was splitting off with Bitcoin ABC?
From the latest release they said
["This is a standard/maintenance release, a new one that will implement UAHF/BUIP055 specification ("Bitcoin Cash") will be provided in the next few days."](
Colour me confused.......
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:41:44
I hope you go kill yourself...... just looking at your comments is enough to realize that the world would be better off without you.....
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:09:42
What a bunch of arseholes you all sound like. People losing there jobs at Xmas, hurrah! Fantastic.... Great news.....
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:07:41
Yeah - always great when an Exchange takes a political stance.... If the chain survives then those coins have some value to some people - if your happy to donate your coins rather then that should be up to you, not an exchange.
It's like they haven't learnt anything from the Ethereum split - or would you be of the opinion that the current no.5 ALT coin is worthless as well?
Now there's still a big 'if' on the chain surviving, but that's not really the point here is it.
