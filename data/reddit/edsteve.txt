I am sure that was not much different in western countries like Germany for example one or two years ago.... Bitcoin really just started one month ago in indonesia.

One month ago almost nobody knew about bitcoin in Indonesia. That changed quickly. Now there is the first 24h bitcoin exchange service. Just a matter of time when we will see the first real time trading in this country. 
Potential is there. Banks dont give a big effort to make online banking comfortable or safe. 3 out of the top 5 local banks of Indonesia are still using 10 years old technology. Poeple definitely dont trust in banks too much. Which makes it easy for Bitcoin becoming more popular...
Lets see who wins the online banking battle.
