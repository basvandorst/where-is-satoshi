I speak from personal experience. Processed over 500,000  transactions ($9.95 and $19.95) in the last 10 years. We've appealed over 100 times (young and naive), IP addresses and email correspondence with customers included, and we never won. NOT ONCE.

@_date: 2015-04-27 13:54:42
Wrong. One of the most common excuses is : "My 9yr old took the  card from my wallet and made the purchase. I did not authorize it. Merchant is not willing to refund. Begin the chargeback procedure immediately."
Then there's the good old "I thought I was buying X but got Y instead". Keep in mind only 20% actually ask the merchant for a refund, others go direct the chargeback route. Their only intention is to get the digital product/service for free.
