Porn has been the driver (no pun intended) for a lot of technology.  Porn used SD video cameras like the Sony VX1000 that proved small chip video was good enough for the small screen.  The VCR, the DVD all owe their success, at least partially, to porn.

Very interesting.  So if you used a service like Dwolla you could avoid some of that risk?  Or is Dwolla just another PayPal wannabe?
This is all fascinating to me because the more the regular economy is rigged in favor of banks, the more it's spied upon and regulated by the government, the more appealing alternatives become.

What are you going to do with your bitcoin besides paying back a lunch tab?

As an industrial metal gold has some uses, but not many.  It's used in solar sails.  So if you think the space solar sail industry is going to take off, then it has potential.  
It was still valuable in recorded history, even though it wasn't terribly useful for making weapons.  More as a universal medium of exchange. 
Intrinsic value is a relative concept.  Gold has intrinsic value even though it's not as industrially useful as platinum and palladium.  
It's like a irregular verb in language.  It violates the rule but everyone uses it.

If I can get the software to work, I'm going to try accepting bitcoins.  Right now the software says "generating" but I'm not sure what it's doing.  
Doesn't your bitcoin address change?  How do people send me coins if it changes every time?  
I'm going to try building up some bitcoin and trading them for real silver, just as an experiment.  I'll report the income value of the physical silver, if I ever receive any.  
Not trying to duck taxes, just throwing a little money into this to see how it works.

The volatility is an issue.  The price in the last 48 hours ranged from $22 to $10.25, that's day trader paradise.  
So if I want to buy bitcoin, I either need to watch the trades all day or have a friend on the exchange.  
Makes it tough to price my services in bitcoin.  A job might yield $20 or $40, depending on the trades that day.  So I have to charge a much higher rate for bitcoin jobs.

I have read the wiki.  That doesn't mean it all makes sense.  
Okay, so the mining the client is doing is pretty much useless these days.
The exchanges can be flaky in how they operate and some of them have been dealing with fraud.  I thought fraud proofing was one of the features of bitcoins?  
More study required.

They can try but I don't know what laws they would use.  Bitcoins are not backed by a commodity, they're not a security and not a bond.  The only value they have is what other people are willing to give for them.  
If I want to come over and mow your lawn in exchange for hub caps, that's perfectly legal provided I report the value of the exchange on my income taxes.  If you want to pay me in bitcoins to write articles for your blog and I accept them, as long as I report the income there's nothing illegal that I know about in that transaction.  
If someone wants to pay me cash in exchange for encrypted tokens, that's nobody else's business.  I know everyone is making a big deal about Silk Road, but it's a non-issue.  I could just as easily mail cash inside a birthday card instead of using bitcoins.  You're trusting the vendor to mail you something both ways.

I'm going to buy some as part of a series of articles I'm writing on bitcoin, but I have no idea what I'm going to do with it.  
That's part of the research.  Buy $100 worth on one of the exchanges, figure out what I can buy and how much I lose on exchanging it back and forth.

Bitcoin suffers from the same issue that the dollar also suffers: It's not backed by anything.  It has relative value but no intrinsic value.  
If you start producing something that's too much like currency, you can get charged with counterfeiting.  
I was thinking of something along the lines of a hybrid gold certificate. A digital key, like a bitcoin, that can be exchanged for genuine gold.  They have gold certificates and bearer bonds are legal, so I'm not sure why you couldn't find a legal way to do it.   
All you're doing is selling people gold and issuing a digital claim check for it.  If people want to pass around the digital claim checks, then that's their business.  It could solve the theft problem, the issuing company could invalidate the tokens.  In a registered exchange one party transfers real gold to the account of another party and the receiver gets new tokens that can be verified online.  
The digital tokens are just proof of ownership.  You come to me to buy something.  I check your tokens and know you're good for the money.  We agree on a price and you enter the amount of the transfer and sign it with your encryption key.  The gold is transferred to my account and I get a new set of digital certs.  
That might be illegal and that's the tough part of starting anything like that.  Again, bearer bonds are legal and they're just paper.

Maybe because the corrupt system we have today started out right, or at least better.  It's broken, but fixable.  It's not going to be an easy fix.  
Incremental improvements can be revolutionary.

If you're trying to make the case that intrinsic value is related to industrial value, you're way off base.  
Gold has intrinsic value, even if it's merely for use in jewelry.  That value has held up for the length of recorded human history.
