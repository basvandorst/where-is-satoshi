Windows it's self is malware. Everyone should switch to the GNU OS, like Fedora. It has much better security by default too.

Well I just browse the reddit home page so I never end up posting till the party has moved on :p. I've been fighting on the front lines with a new system called Guix, which is super interesting. It aims to build a fully reproducible OS where every program is referenced by the hash of all it's dependencies and your system can never get into an inconsistent state no matter how many things you install and uninstall.

Nothing, really. No concurrency solution is adequate for mass adoption at the present time. Regardless, cryptocurrencies are increasing in popularity every single day.

Hi ViruSZ, I suggest reviewing the form of your argument. It says that we have a problem, and therefore we may as well choose to have even more problems anyway. Consider that if you had the flu, would you say "Oh well, may as well go get Malaria and AIDS too". It doesn't make sense. Using libre software fixes most of the big issues, ensuring that there is no 3rd party with inherent control over your system. The only remaining issue is the purely technical problem of security. That is significantly better than voluntarily allowing your entire system to be designed from the ground up to be deliberately malicious, illegal and impossible to modify or study. I think this is a sort of Status Quo Bias, because believing that there exist outstanding problems that could be solved but currently aren't is discomforting, like an unresolved discord. Taking on the defeatist attitude that nothing can be done regardless allows one to relax, feeling that there is no obligation to do anything whatsoever to improve the status quo, as no such improvement exists.
