At current difficulty it will mine just over 1 bitcoin a month.  As difficulty continues to increase it is overwhelmingly likely that it will never earn back the cost of it's components (and probably won't even make half of it).

I will never buy ASICMINER stock because it's a known fact that it will turn you into a drone of their hive mind, and every one of your posts will reference the [power and glory of ASICMINER](

Nope, even the best ATI cards are about to become obsolete for bitcoin mining.

* The first issue that I have always had with these types of arrangements that screams "stay away" is that if you've found such a profitable idea, why wouldn't you put up your own money or acquire funds through a traditional source.  Taking very expensive loans from internet strangers is just bad business, and (and I'm not trying to be excessively mean here) I would never invest money with someone who appears to be bad at business.
* The second issue I have is that I'm unclear what your plan is exactly.  Are you just planning on taking our money and ordering a bunch of BFL equipment now?  I'm not saying this is a terrible idea, or that you might not make money, but your website is very skimpy on details.  If you have satisfactory answers to both of these concerns I'd be the first to invest, I'm just concerned that this is a scam, or even worse, a poorly thought out business plan.
