I do not anticipate any big dips in BTC. There is widespread media attention and lots of people are flocking to bitcoin for the first time in their lives. This will prevent dips cause by any flow towards altcoins. The net effect will be altcoins getting pumped while bitcoin keeping or increasing its dollar value. Anyone who has been trading cryptos for at least a few weeks knows that altcoins getting pumped offer massive short term speculative gains.  Nobody can truly predict the future but we can make our best guesses. Thanks for the advice though.

Try viabtc accelerator. They only accept 100 requests every hour for free so you have to time yourself and submit request as soon as the computer clocks change to 00 (e.g 6:00:00 pm). I cant recall if they only help accelerate tx with a minimum of 100 sat/B. Just check. I had paid 201 sat/B for a 600B+ transaction two days ago (total fee of 0.0012BTC) and it took 26 hours. I submitted request to viabtc transaction accelerator about 12 hours before it got confirmed.

Thanks all for the good luck. Just sent all my BTC from wallet to exchange. Fingers crossed.
