I think there is a valid concern here that everyone is missing with regards to bitaddress.org
Yes, it has plenty of entropy. Yes, it asks for plenty of random-ness. Yes, you can save it offline.
But all of that is based on trusting that someone has gone through and read all of the code, confirming that it doesn't have a record of the private keys generated before you save the website locally. And it is also based on someone confirming that the randomness you put in there is actually used. And then if someone does confirm all of that, well then you have to trust that person...
Consider this. What if the person who wrote bitaddress.org has code on the page that keeps a copy of the next 20 keys it will generate after a website visit, regardless of random input?
You download the page locally, you run the random numbers (Which it ignores), you then use, say, the 12th key. If you haven't checked the code yourself, it is possible that whoever runs bitaddress.org knew what that 12th private key would be even before you saved the site locally.
Based on all of this, flipping a coin 154 times or whatever number it is, is a better method IMO.

Hi Dean,
It would be great to send a little support the way of this group. They sponsor kids to go to high school in Myanmar.
On their donation page, they accept Bitcoin natively.
Just 1 BTC would send another child through high school and would make a big difference.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:59:58
Hi Dean,
Thanks so much for doing this.
How about stepupinle.com ? It is dedicated to sending impoverished children in Myanmar to secondary school. They've sent three children to school so far.
They are a registered charity, and they accept BTC donations! (
1 BTC would send a child to secondary school for the duration of their schooling and would make a big difference.

It makes a good argument about the future failure of alt currencies.
A lot of this doesn't properly apply to Bitcoin though.
He mentions in one of the figures above his Unobtainium study that major cryptocurrencies are exempt.
The block reward halving is not going to create the problem that he lists. Look at the halving in 2013. The price just doubled basically. Same will happen in 2017. Supply halves, so price doubles.

It may have been intentional.
The money in and out happened in the same second.
It is possible someone intentionally moved the money through this address for plausible deniability reasons.
Perhaps they thought there was a good chance they would be able to transfer it out first (Which they probably have). The could say to officials, if questioned, however, that they accidentally transferred it there, and because the private key is known, it would be plausible that it was stolen.

Very well written article Vinny, great stuff.
I do have one question though. When comparing Bitcoin to, say, MySpace and Facebook... it could be argued that MySpace already had the network effect, it already had mass adoption/mass appeal, and yet it was overtaken by Facebook.
The same could be said when looking at Yahoo vs Google. There was a time when Yahoo did have the advantage of the network effect, only to be overtaken by Google.
Can you speak to this and explain why this will or will not happen to Bitcoin?

@_date: 2014-05-30 02:23:10
This is an interesting article, but it is not without its flaws.
1. The comparison with Auroracoin as an example is pretty weak. Auroracoin was a failed experiment at best, a pump and dump at worst, with no real acceptance or widespread use. Comparing that with Bitcoin, even in a mining sense, is weak. Auroracoin would have suffered from problems that all of the small coins have, problems that Bitcoin surpassed long ago.
2. Much of this argument is based around assuming that all miners will act in an economically rational way. This does not always hold true for several reasons. First off, there are the enthusiasts, folks who are happy to run their miners just for the novelty of it, and for the knowledge that they are part of a major world changing network. This is similar to people who used to run SETI... it was not for profit, it was just for the technology, even though it was at a loss. Also, if any of these mining problems start to eventuate and the difficulty adjustments do not solve the problem natively, one needs to consider that people with large bitcoin holdings will start spending a part of their investment or profits to run full nodes or miners at a loss, in the interests of preserving the value of their entire investment. If someone like Gavin Andresen mentions that we don't have enough full nodes, what happens? Lots of people, particularly those with a big Bitcoin vested interest or investment, view this as a risk and start spending some capital to run full nodes.
3. The block reward halving. In 2013, the block reward halved and the price shot up to accommodate. In 2017 the same thing will happen, simple as that. It will be more difficult to acquire Bitcoins, there will be fewer being sold, there will be less downward pressure on the market, and hence, the price will go up. Pretty simple. The block reward halving in 2017 is not going to create the problem that this article mentions.
4. Ripple. Seriously - Suggesting that Ripple, a centralized setup, is a solution to this makes me wonder if whoever is writing this article has an alterior motive. Ripple cannot get the sort of traction that Bitcoin has, despite its marketing budget, as it does not have the grass roots support. It does not have the grass roots support because it is centralized.

Ok, while I agree with this chart to $10,000, it is absolutely not sustainable past 2017. Here's my logic.
Review the graph and you will see that it increases 10 fold approx every year. Note that June 2013 has a yellow median of $100. Also note that June 2014 has a yellow median of $1000, and June 2015, at the end of the chart, has a yellow median of $10,000. Continue another year past the end of this chart and you have a yellow median of $100,000 per Bitcoin at June 2016, a median of $1,000,000 at June 2017 and a median of $10,000,000 at June 2018. Is this possible?
June 2013, $100 per BTC, yup, we hit that, okay. June 2014, agreed, we hit $1000 per BTC at some point. So far so good. Now let's consider June 2015 $10,000 and June 2016 $100,000 and see if this is realistic.
Consider the Winklevoss twins and their hoard of Bitcoins. They own 1%. Let's be conservative and say they own 1% of the current bitcoins, 13 million. 1% of 13 million gives you 130,000. At $100 per BTC, that is worth $13 million bucks. Okay, cool. At $1000 per BTC, that is worth $130 million bucks. Still okay.
So now let's consider June 2015 and June 2016.
If this trend holds, the Winklevoss twins will own 130,000 * $10,000 worth of Bitcoins. That is 1.3 Billion dollars by June 2015. That wouldn't even put you in the list of the top 100 richest people in the world. Basically, this is still possible.
Now consider June 2016, when one BTC should be $100,000. Multiply this by 130,000, and you have 13 Billion dollars. Still possible, although it would put the Winklevoss up there as the 86th/87th richest people in the world. Could happen.
What about 2017 and 2018?
Look at June 2017, when one BTC should be $1,000,000. Multiply this by 130,000 and you have $130 Billion. This would put them as the richest people in the world by almost double. Getting very unrealistic now. Technically possible but unrealistic.
Finally, look at June 2018, when one BTC should be $10,000,000. Multiply this by 130,000 and you have $1.13 trillion, or a 10th of US GDP. The first ever trillionaires. Incredibly unrealistic. Basically this could not happen without a very rapid collapse of the US dollar.
Is the US dollar going to collapse? Probably. It is going to happen as rapidly as 2018? No way. If it did in that fashion, neither Bitcoin, nor gold, nor US dollars would be traded. Food, guns and ammunition would be the items of value. The US dollar collapse will be a gradual thing, not as quick as that.
So the graph is interesting, and can certainly continue through to 2016, perhaps even a little towards 2017, but after that you're going to see a flattening for sure.

So much vitriol for BetKing, and yet it is one of the longest running and most honest dice sites out there.
I've been involved with it forever and a day, and have not once had a problem with deposits, withdrawals, investments... It's been great, as I'm sure all of the other big investors will attest.
Strange that you rant on about it so much when you were an investor yourself who did well from your investment (All long term investors with BetKing / PRC did very well).
I have absolutely no reservations about getting involved in the ICO, and happy for anyone to PM me for the real story about BetKing.
The folks who complain tend to be ones who are betting or investing tiny amounts and don't realize that a spin can genuinely come up red 12 times in a row. Happens all the time.
The real investors who put in more than 1BTC just stay quiet and watch their investment grow while wondering why everyone else bitches so much.

Wasn't someone on the forums recently offering $5000 for the private keys of early mined Bitcoins?
Surely this is one and the same...
@_date: 2019-06-17 06:34:32
Basically, there was a forum post where someone was offering to pay $5000 for the private keys of any early wallets that had bitcoin mined into them.
The idea is that the person who currently has the private key ensures it is empty of bitcoin, and then shares the private key with the person offering to pay and takes the $5000 payment.
The person offering to pay can now pretend that they owned that wallet all along, which I presume is something that would be handy for Craig.

No. But he claimed that he did in a few court documents and also by claiming he is Satoshi.
If you don’t have enough proof that he never had significant amount of bitcoin, the hacked Mt Gox database shows that he bought some bitcoin at the peak during 2013 using his email address. Not something you’d expect Satoshi or an early miner would need to do.
Kleiman estate may actually know that he doesn’t have much bitcoin, but they might as well sue considering that Craig has *claimed* he has so much. They are suing based on the claim, not based on any evidence that he has those BTC.

Such a hatchet job, focusing on all of the negatives.
No mention of any positives at all - Fidelity, Lightening, Schnorr/Taproot developments....

There's a great bitcoin ATM on the outskirts of Madrid.
No ID or RoboCoin crap required, just send to the correct QR code, wait for confirmation, then it spits out euros.
Location is...
IBEROBIT Bitcoin ATM *Avenida Guadalajara 4
Alcalá de Henares
