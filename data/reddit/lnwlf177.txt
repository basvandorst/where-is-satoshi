Your Electrum wallet or Bread wallet on your phone don't actually hold any "bitcoins" on it.
Your wallet simply holds the private KEY to accessing and controlling your Bitcoin.
The "key" to your Bitcoin that your wallet holds is derived from a 12 or 24 word seed phrase that *contains within it  the cryptographic proof that you own that key.*
This means that with that seed phrase, you can reproduce your keys anywhere, anytime, and once again have full access to your private keys.
This is why protecting your seed phrase is so critically important. Your actual wallet, even hardware wallets, can basically be considered disposable. The seed phrase, however, if it is lost, is irrecoverable and you will lose access to your Bitcoin forever.

When you buy Bitcoin, you remove supply from the available pool of liquid BTC available for sale. If you control for demand and decrease supply, the price increases. It's a law of economics.
I'm sure someone will come in and tell me otherwise, but common sense dictates if you removed 50% of available supply and demand remains the same, the price will obviously rise. This is so basic and universal that it could be witnessed with monkeys competing for bananas.
When you buy 0.003 BTC, is the price going to increase? Well, technically yes, in the same sense that a drop in the ocean increases its volume. Practically speaking though, no we wouldn't be able to reliably measure such a small decrease in supply available for trade.
But yes, in general, buying crypto increases its price, especially when viewed from an aggregate perspective.

The rise of third-party custodial services for crypto is necessary for mass-adoption to occur, and in my opinion is absolutely inevitable.
Isn't crypto about having *choice*? The great thing about Bitcoin is that you can *choose* to hold the private keys yourself and have sovereignty over your money.
But if someone decides they feel more comfortable holding their crypto with a third-party that specializes in secure custodial services, who is to say that they are 'wrong' for *choosing* to do so?

Boot into (a Linux OS that runs off a flashdrive); open the Electrum Wallet that comes pre-installed; generate a wallet without connecting to the internet; use your phone to easily scan the public key and create a watch-only wallet.
This is the safest way to use Electrum.

The difference is that the US military has been enforcing the use of the US dollar to buy oil for almost 50 years. 
If you want oil, you've had to own US dollars. That creates demand. And if you refuse...well, ask Saddam Hussein how that worked out for him when he announced Iraq was going to start trading oil for Euros, or Qaddafi when he revealed his plan to sell oil for gold.
The petrodollar is coming to an end, though. Even China and Russia have begun moving away from the petrodollar.

And I would add, if OP has considerable holdings, that you should buy a hardware wallet, like a Trezor or a Ledger product. 
Having your own on wallet on your phone or PC is magnitudes safer than holding Bitcoin on an exchange... but using a hardware wallet is magnitudes safer than holding your Bitcoin on your phone or laptop. 
This is what is called "cold storage". You don't have to buy a hardware wallet to create a cold storage wallet, but it is the easiest, safest way to do it.

Oh yes, of course, but I was just thinking, theoretically if I died and didn't have a plan for transferring my crypto assets to family, and in 100 years a descendent found the seed phrase stashed somewhere in the attic, if by then that Bitcoin would basically be "bricked" or not.
It is a legitimate question, because this kind of situation *will o*ccur if Bitcoin continues to exist well into the future.

You don't lose your coins if a flash drive with your keys on it fails because you have multiple backup copies of the seed.
This is misinformation.
A hardware wallet is not "just a USB flash drive". It is a product that provides layers of advanced security while maintaining ease of access and usability. Granted, for small amounts of crypto the barrier for entry is too high, but when you start getting into thousands of dollars worth of crypto, a hardware wallet is absolutely worth its price tag for most people who don't want to bother with booting up into live OS's and messing around with Veracrypt, ect.

During this most recent correction, which started in October, and is rapidly spiralling toward being a recession, has been accompanied by mirror image gains in gold and silver.
In 2008, it was treasuries that everyone fled to.  And while treasuries have also gone up in the last few months, it has clearly been hard money that people have selected as the safe haven of this downturn.
Crypto, on the other hand, dumped along with stocks.
I am actually bullish on this... the tide recedes right before the tsunami hits. We have never seen Bitcoin in action during a major financial crisis. We're headed into uncharted territory.

Just create a new wallet on Electrum and select "I already have a seed" during the wallet creation process. Enter the seed, and whatever balance was on that old wallet will now be unlocked and you can access it with the new wallet.

My understanding is that we would either:
a) come to a general consensus regarding a new quantum-computing derived encryption protocol and smoothly soft fork into it before SHA-256 is cracked
b) the looming threat of SHA-256 being cracked leads to a contentious hard-fork, or even several competing hard-forks, while Bitcoin Core continues to take its chances that SHA-256 will remain secure.

If you really want to get this full node up and running, try AirVPN out, it isn't free but you can pay a couple dollars for a few days of access. AirVPN has a virtual port forwarding service that allows you to forward ports through their servers instead of your computer. It is extremely easy to do. 
The only thing is, you'll have to set your full node client to a custom port (whichever one AirVPN assigns to you), but this is as easy as opening the configuration file, typing "port=12345" and saving the file.

You'll have to go into your router and open it in there. Check [here]( to see if they have a tutorial for how to do it for your router.
If this doesn't work, you could use [AirVPN]( virtual port-forwarding capability. This allows you to open ports almost with a click of a button without accessing your router.
If you don't open ports though, your node will basically be "listen only"; it will confirm your transactions on the blockchain, but it won't allow other nodes to connect to you in order to confirm their transactions.

Hardware wallets receive frequent firmware updates. Most of them are quite seamless, although I have heard of at least one firmware update for Trezor which required wiping the device. Over on I have also seen some incidents of apparent software glitches that resulted in the device being wiped (though some/many of these may be attributable to user error).
However, **as long as you have your seed phrase**, wiping the device or even crushing it under your boot isn't really a big deal. "Bitcoins" aren't actually stored in them; they are stored in the blockchain, which is immutably backed up on thousands of independent nodes, but only accessible with the private keys.
If there is a rare firmware update that does require wiping the device, I assure you, this will be explicitly stated and nothing will be wiped until you know for sure that you have access to your seed phrase. And if there were a glitch that accidentally wiped your device (or it was destroyed or lost), it really isn't a big deal as long as you have reliable copies of your seed phrase to recovery your private keys with.

The number of BTC remaining is one (major) factor, yes, but it also takes into consideration feedback from miners and detects if they are no longer able to operate at current difficulty levels (I think over a period of two weeks).
If it wasn't like this, Bitcoin would be vulnerable to major energy shocks that could wipe out mining profitability.  The network could be wiped out in the event of a major energy crisis. This way, such an energy crisis can be adjusted for, allowing the network to survive dramatic, sustained energy shortages.

My grandparents gave up the chequebooks for the debit card a couple decades ago. Debit cards are ubiquitous. 
But I don't disagree with you either: financial systems can absolutely exist in parallel. This is actually a very good thing, because if crypto fails in its infancy, we at least have an established system to fall-back on. But if (when) the legacy system fails, it won't be like in 2008 when we had no where else to turn. Now we do. We have a monetary system with a built-in payment network ready to go if SWIFT ever goes down.
And make no mistake about it: crypto mass, worldwide adoption will not be a choice for most.

I think it is, actually. I saw a video where Andreas Antonopoulos explained the automatically adjustable nature of mining difficulty. 
Even if energy prices were to quadruple, the mining algo would simply adjust to the downside when it detected a huge decline in computing power being dedicated to the network, allowing it to survive the higher energy costs.

The philosophy of Bitcoin is that it is sound money that is digitally extensible and which can be held directly with zero counter-party risk.
That doesn't mean it HAS to be held directly for Bitcoin to still serve as hard money.
Gold has zero counter-party risk if you hold it directly, but the wealthy don't hold gold in their basement or bury it in the backyard -- they hold it with trusted custodians that are covered by comprehensive insurance policies.
It will be the same with Bitcoin, if/when it becomes a serious storage of value for the wealthy; they will be holding much of their crypto with custodians in Switzerland and Singapore. 
Where are pension funds and endowments and trusts supposed to hold crypto? In a Trezor stashed in an office safe? No, when the institutional money comes in, they'll be holding crypto in institutional forms.

I suspect that a hacker had control of a camera on OP's computer or phone and were able to catch a glimpse of the recovery key written down on paper. This is why you must NEVER expose your seed key to any camera, especially your phone's camera. You never know who is watching.
I feel bad for OP, but keeping your recovery seed in your wallet, *while travelling aborad no less*, was a stunning miscalcuation. Why leave the Trezor at home but keep the recovery key in plain text in your wallet? It defeats the whole purpose of even using a Trezor.

It just means that a huge 'bid' order gobbled up all the available 'ask' orders to the extent that the next available ask price is 7% higher.
Of course, if these monster orders are occurring *off-chain,* you always have to wonder if these mystery whales are actually trading real crypto. In other words, is fractional-reserve banking occurring at some of the major crypto exchanges? Because if it is, market manipulation is as easy as a click of a mouse for anyone who has insider-access to those platforms.

The control of the supply of Bitcoin, and the on-chain transactions, have always and will forever be decentralized. And that's the important part: we need money with a supply that cannot be manipulated by state actors. And that's what Bitcoin is.
But a degree of centralization will inevitably emerge. It has to.
Institutional investors are bound by strict compliance laws that prevent them from currently investing in crypto. A hundred billion dollar endowment fund can't just go on Coinbase and buy some Bitcoins and keep them on a hot wallet.
There will need to be some compelling "Fort Knox" solutions to the storage of crypto for institutional and government accounts, or crypto will never replace gold as the asset that trillion dollar actors turn to for preservation of wealth.

True, and that's why I think that if/when mass adoption occurs, it will only be when there is a trusted solution for storing crypto with a third-party custodian that is insured and audited.
I know, I know, "not your keys, not your Bitcoin". But my grandma is never going to operate a Trezor. If my grandmother ever uses crypto, it will be because a bank is storing it for her and she can use her debit card to use it.

I'm not saying that endowments won't/aren't interested in crypto. I'm saying that institutional money requires institutional-grade storage solutions, which will come in the form of third-party custodial services. 
Maybe a few mavericks will decide to hold their crypto directly, and hire an entire team to create and maintain a first-party custody solution, but I suspect that most will turn to trusted third-party services with reputations equivalent to Swiss banking vaults.
