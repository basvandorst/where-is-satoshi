It appears to be a site that links you to other bitcoin related sites. It might be a scam of some sort and I can't find any info about the people on their about page. I would stay clear for now.
I cannot find anything about the CEO "Vasil" but have found little of the other 2.
[Linkedin Profile]( for "Philip", he appears to already have a job. 
Alexander seems to only have a YouTube account.

I don't really think that many people will switch to a brand new altcoin. It has been 6 years since bitcoin was created but it has filled an extremely small amount of its potential.
If a new alt coin comes, then the majority of people will not start using it because people don't like change, which is part of the reason some are not accepting/embracing bitcoin.
Even if a new altcoin appears it will most likely be like Dash or Litecoin, which bring some new features to the table but still get overshadowed by bitcoin because it has been established as a currency.
As we are seeing with the block size debate, there are still people working on Bitcoin and can make necessary improvements to keep itself afloat.
TL:DR If a great altcoin appears it will not be accepted because of bitcoin's established market and community.

I think that a transition to a new coin would be a very difficult thing for everyone to do and very few would make the switch.  A new and better cryptocurrency would die off, end up like litecoin and others or become a helper rather than a competitor to bitcoin.  Possible co-exist with bitcoin.
Because it took 6 years for bitcoin to get here, the time that an altcoin would have to take to develop into something at the current state of bitcoin, bitcoin will continue to gather new innovation.

Faster connections for nodes, miners and users.  Or if someone wants to run a node and download the blockchain they don't have to wait a few months.
