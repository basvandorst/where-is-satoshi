Yeah that’s right. Actually Coinbase is insured for potential loss, but many exchanges aren’t. Use offline storage for the majority of your bitcoin and long term hodling. Keep a small amount on an exchange for everyday use (when Bitcoin becomes more widely accepted)

How would you feel if your wife made significant purchases on her own without discussing them with you? 
How would your wife feel if she ever finds out you bought bitcoin without telling her? How would she react?
Ask yourself why you are questioning the need to tell your wife about bitcoin? Do you not trust her? Have you typically been bad with money and she sees your enthusiasm with bitcoin more akin to gambling, rather than investing ? 
From personal experience, my partner’s response was: “I trust you know what you’re doing”. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:01:22
I hope you pull through this and no doubt you are still feeling raw. But Bitcoin isn’t to blame, and your wife is right to describe you as stupid and reckless, rather than blame Bitcoin. This is about you betraying her trust. You could’ve done the same with stocks, or any other investment. 
Have you been impulsive in the past? Was this the final straw? Perhaps its time to see a counsellor to help you work through this.

If you don’t own your keys, you don’t own your bitcoin.
Storing on an exchange like Coinbase leaves them (and you) open to hacking or shutdown. As big as Coinbase is, always remember Mt Gox happened. 
There are also software wallets like breadwallet which you install as an app on your phone. Better than an exchange as you control your keys, but could still be vulnerable if your phone is hacked.
Offline wallets like a hardware wallet is the best option. Trezor and Nano Ledger are the most trusted. Slightly trickier to set up is a paper wallet but its virtually free. Risk mainly involves losing your hardware/paper wallet to fire/flood/nukes.
Every storage option has an element of risk but some moreso than others. 
Keep reading and learning about bitcoin - especially in how storage and transactions work. The sticky in r/bitcoin for beginners is a great starting point. I’ll be honest, don’t put a dollar more into bitcoin until you fully understand the basics. The last thing you want to do is fuck something up and lose your money. Bitcoin can be quite unforgiving in that way.

Every method has its pitfalls. Storing it on an electronic medium has its risks, from hacking to the hardware just failing. Storing it in physical form is vulnerable to fire, flood or theft.
I believe a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor was designed to be kept offline, so I keep it that way. Which means a safe or safety deposit box.

They’re just a clickbait website in order to get mentioned on the bitcoin news section, then once they’ve sucked a reader in they spruik their stock stuff. 
They could be totally bullish on bitcoin, but still end it off on “BUT look at these stocks we recommend!!”

Its a cliche, but those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
If I’m not mistaken, there were much more fewer options to store coins back in the Mt Gox days, and I suppose many thought Mt Gox was too big to fail.

Ignore the haters. The value of money, and what it means, is different to each and every person. You are debt free now, which is a position many would envy. I sold a lot of shares to reduce my debt and pay for my wedding and I have zero regrets. We should be in control of our money, not the other way around.
But keep that 1 BTC, if just for a laugh ;)
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:54:28
With all due respect, it sounds like you need to do a bit more homework and research before plonking more money down. You'll be better educated about the risks and gains, and subsequently have a better idea of how much you're willing to invest. Plus having more knowledge about blockchain and cryptocurrency can only be a good thing.
I'll repeat what you've been told a few times already: invest only what you're prepared to lose. This goes for any investment, not just bitcoin. 
In short, its not too late. But know what you're getting yourself into.
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:14:38
At the very least, volatility is expected, even celebrated, within the bitcoin community. That makes the dips and panic selling shorter and bitcoin more resistant in the long run. Even when bitcoin moons, we are still expecting dips and falls. 
This is why I don’t think we’re in a bubble, there won’t be a sudden unexpected pop.

Interestingly one of the big four (Westpac) has invested in Coinbase, so clearly they’re seeing money to be made.

No issues per se with Coinjar, but their fees and rates are somewhat higher. I just signed up with BTC Markets for an alternative to try out.

So reading the story, I take it one of the problems was using a weak, not uncommon phrase for the brain wallet and some enterprising bugger had the address ready to be swept within 10 seconds of btc being deposited.
Question: if an address has been compromised, is it fair to say that the coins would  likely be stolen within a short amount of time? Is a ‘thief’ likely to wait for an accumulation of coins before sweeping the wallet? I’ve had a paper wallet for a couple of months and I hoping that if no one’s stolen my btc by now, then it is secure?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:34:19
I watched the segment, by parabolic he meant that the rate of increase is accelerating. So...good then? 
He was quite positive about it this time, in the past Alan Kohler has described bitcoin as a bubble though he admits to not fulling understanding it. Though he also acknowledged supply is limited and that investors are looking for a market with a bit more volatility as the share market has been quite flat.

I visited the only bitcoin ATM in my city for the first time this weekend to see what it was like. Was surprised to say the least by the shitty markup in purchasing bitcoin, 10% give or take.  My exchange is something along the line of 2%.  I walked out needless to say.
An ATM is good if you want to purchase anonymously as it takes cash. But you pay a premium for it.
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:30:22
I’m not sure I want these greasy Wall St shysters anywhere near bitcoin. Not unless they actually believe in cryptocurrency as a decentralised deregulated currency, rather than some financial whore they can pump and dump.

My work colleagues aren’t outright critical, but they simply don’t buy into what they don’t understand. Its still too early for a big “told you so” moment so now I play the waiting game. Ironically they’re big on gambling and pissing money away on the horses so go figure. 
My fiance and parents have been pleasantly supportive. They know I’ve done my research and have not put money down that I was not prepared to lose.

On a side note, I work in the Justice system. I had a case before me this week about a guy imprisoned for buying drugs off (presumably Silk Road or similar) the internet and paying with Bitcoin. Wanted to make some money onselling the drugs.
This happened last year when 1 BTC was worth around $500. If he had just decided to hodl, he would’ve made much more money. Made me laugh.

Calling bitcoin a ponzi scheme shows lack of understanding of bitcoin AND ponzi schemes. The latter gives returns to early investors through funds raised by later investors. No more new investors = the system collapses. Bitcoin doesn’t work this way. Someone who bought bitcoin today, can cash out tomorrow at a profit. They don’t sit on the bottom waiting for the hodlers from 2009 getting fat. If there are no more buyers of bitcoin, it doesn’t crash and burn. It may dip, it may plateau, but it still chugs on.
Ponzi schemes promise high short term returns so IMO the misinformed are associating this with bitcoin’s current price jump, enthusiastic hype (yachts and Lamborghinis) and future price predictions. So yeah I cringe a little at some of the dream talk when we are still in the very early stages.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:12:25
I’m new to the scene like yourself but for the past few months I’ve been reading up on bitcoin and cryptocurrency everyday, absorbing information like a sponge. I honestly believe we are still in the early stages of something huge.
Understand that there are both sides to every argument. Make no mistake, every party has their own motive to determine the fate of bitcoin and desire to profit. I float between both subreddits and continue to listen to both arguments. Try to ignore the shitposts and personal attacks.

Agreed. My brother saying bitcoin could go to 670,000 piqued my interest. But it was a week of solid research and reading about blockchain and cryptocurrency is what made me pull the trigger to invest in bitcoin. Never invest in what you don’t understand.

Because the SEC has a great track record on holding the big banks and financial institutions to account. It takes a simple google of “SEC subprime mortgage crisis” to see how pathetic they were, because they were too close to the very institutions they were supposed to provide oversight. 
There’s another financial monkey hanging on the US economy (read up on student debt crisis) and the SEC is standing aside twiddling its thumbs. Best get prepared by reducing debt and having liquid assets (savings, BTC)

I saw one for the first time last weekend. Saw a couple of guys load wads of cash into the machine. I saw the exchange rate and noped the hell out of there...about a 10% fee/premium/hike. I don’t think they realised it either because I saw them do a double take after they put their money in. Its all well and good if you want anonymity or instant transfer, but for me the markup isn’t worth it.
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:07:26
You are right in that there may be a dip post fork due to uncertainty/fighting about who will emerge with the title of Bitcoin. However there will be many others waiting for that dip to buy low, myself included, which will similarly bring prices back up. I expect a bit of a rollercoaster ride.
I’m waiting for the smoke to clear, but one thing I will be doing is having an immediate pool of funds ready to buy more coins with.
