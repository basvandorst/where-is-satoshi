My first buy was Nov 1st when the price was $200.  My first (and only) sell was when the price was climbing in mid November.  I sold at ~$500 before bed, and then it hit $700 while I slept.
I learned my lesson: Don't sell.

I've been buying every two weeks since the price was $120.  This has nothing to do with what I have invested, it has to do with the fact that you want to purposely drive the price down in an attempt to "teach GHash a lesson." Your logic is flawed and you refuse to see it.
I'm done trying to show you how your idea is ridiculous.  I'll let all of the downvotes you've been getting do the speaking.

I have a reoccurring send set up via Coinbase to pay for my VPS hosting.
My flow is:
1. Scheduled buy at Coinbase at 6AM on payday
2. Send $5 worth to ChunkHost at 11AM.
3. Then, around Noon, I manually send any remaining amount to a paper wallet.
If you're not in the States, then you wouldn't be able to buy via Coinbase, the schedule send will work though as long as you deposit some coins first.

You must've avoided this subreddit last week.  There was a huge fuss about how much of the hashrate GHash.io had.  A lot of people moved from GHash to other pools to help drop the hashing power GHash.io had.
@_date: 2014-01-13 17:11:23


Their clients are the people that bought cloudmining via CEX.  Since CEX hasn't implemented the change to allow their clients to move to a different pool this means that 100% of CEX clients are still on GHash.


This statement doesn't make any sense to me.  The hashing speed of the pool is the exact same as the pool speed, is it not?
Also, don't forget that the chart you linked is not actual hashing marketshare, but the share of blocks completed by each pool in the timeframe specified.
Over the last 4 days, GHash has completed 33% of the blocks.  Doesn't mean they have 33% of the hashrate.

The wallet needs access to the blockchain in order to determine value.  If it is offline, it probably doesn't have the blockchain synced.
Most wallet clients will let you add watch-only addresses, so you can see the balance without being able to spend from it.  You'd still need to be online for this, but at least you wouldn't have to worry about someone getting your private key.
EDIT: I assume most clients allow for watch addresses, however they may call them something else.

Ahhh.  I believe you are correct.  I misread that part.  Still, if his software is somehow backdoored (on purpose or accidental, like a bug in the code) then it could've been exploited to access his API key.
If anyone else has access to the machine could've just pulled it from the code.  If it isn't a local machine, but on a VPS then his hosting account could've been compromised and then the 'recovery' console used to lift the info.
Regardless of how it happened, I think the API key method is a poor implementation of an API.  Coinbase does support OAuth2 and I would recommend using it over the key based method.  
Just my two cents.

@_date: 2014-01-09 03:19:17
I'm not angry, I'm annoyed.  You aren't showing any foresight into the problems 'idiot-proof' mining may lead to.
I don't want the network to be centralized, that would mean an almost certain death to Bitcoin.  Do I think that mining should be more user friend for the average joe, sure.  I just don't think now is the right time.
I've already stated that I think easier wallet security is more important but, I also feel that the growing size of the blockchain will cause a lot of problems for the average joe miner. If we continue on our current rate of growth, the blockchain will become too large for them to maintain.  They're not going to understand why they have to sync the blockchain for days before they can start mining.
Don't forget that on mining on consumer grade hardware will quickly lead to hardware failure.  If we make mining too easy for anyone to pick up without understanding the risks, then those people are going to quickly drop out when their laptop craps out due to constant overheating, causing us to be back in the position we are currently in.

@_date: 2014-04-14 17:14:44
Reading this a month later, I see how I could've worded this better. Using the word 'verbatim' is a little misleading.
If you were to download the code and compile it without any modification, then it would be using the Bitcoin blockchain.  It would be Bitcoin.  Using the previous example of Google, if they were to copy it and re-release it as GoogleCoin but changed nothing at all in the code, it would still be Bitcoin because it is using the Bitcoin blockchain.
Now, if Google copied the code and generated a new Genesis block, then it would be the exact same code, but a different blockchain.
Hopefully that helps clear things up a bit.

I guess it depends on the kind of company.  It if is a merchant selling goods (shopping cart style), that doesn't bother me so much. 
If it is a service with a reoccurring payment structure (utility type) then I feel would carry significantly more weight if an existing customer were to say "hey, can I possibly pay with Bitcoin?".
Maybe a (poor) example will help illustrate my feelings:
I'm annoyed when someone knocks on my door, or calls my phone, unsolicited.  I know I'd be significantly more annoyed if 100 people all contacted me in the span of a week.
Now, if my neighbor stopped by some time and said, "Hey, I just started using Product X, it's pretty neat.  Try it out sometime."  I'd be more likely to actually try the product.

1. You can compile the code on your own.  That way you can be sure that the code you're running is legit.  If there were two different versions out there we'd likely end up with a fork of the blockchain, which means that people using the legit version would be on a different chain the people using the modified version.  
3. There is a way, but that way is by brute forcing.  It would take hundreds of years and massive amounts of computing power to brute force a single address.
5. In order for the blockchain to be wiped it would require every single node to go down at once and never come back up.

If you click on the transaction (on Coinbase) to get the details, there should be an 'Advanced Details' link.  This will give you the blockchain details on the transaction.  The transaction id will be a link toward the top. You can copy that id and plug it into blockchain.info (blockchain.info/tx/TRANSACTION_ID).
I've noticed that a transaction from Coinbase will pretty much always say pending for the first hour, even if it has a handful of confirmations.
If the advanced details link isn't displayed, then the transaction probably hasn't been broadcast yet or it was an off-blockchain transaction.

Just because he isn't to-the-mooning or keeping in line with popular opinion doesn't mean everything he says is invalid.
The point he raised is that if you don't already have bitcoins and need something in a rush, like OP did, using bitcoin doesn't make sense.  Is a 3% discount via Gyft, or an item on Overstock, something that you need to rush over?  If so, why can't you just use cash or a credit card?  Why add additional hurdles to the process?

The warning is because of the volatility of Bitcoin right now.  Bitcoin is high risk. With more awareness/acceptable this volatility will decline and make it more reasonable to put more money into it.

I'm not trying to argue with you.  Sorry if I'm coming off that way.


EXACTLY! We have multiple Bitcoins because sometimes we need to send/buy more than the current value of a single Bitcoin.  If I only have one of something, it doesn't matter how many times I can divide it if I need two of them.  Are you familiar with the 10,000 BTC pizza?
When Bitcoin first started, it had no value compared to fiat.  Then, for a while a single Bitcoin was worth a few cents.  If you wanted to buy something worth $1, you had to spend multiple Bitcoins to buy it.

Mozilla happened after Netscape died.  Did Netscape die because of the sort of things MS was being accused of?  It comes off that way from the wiki article.  If Netscape hadn't died, would Mozilla/Firefox be a thing?
Maybe a rephrase of my initial question: Would the second browser war have happened if the suit against microsoft hadn't happened in the 90s?
I never said that it made a 'better internet', I asked if the sort of innovation we've seen in how we use the internet would have happened if Microsoft had been allowed to maintain their anti-competitive practices?
However, I do see your point about how MS letting IE become stagnant makes more sense than what I was thinking.  Thanks for that tidbit of information.

I've had my account for a while too, so I'm also fuzzy on the exact process.  I do believe I had to wait at least a day or two for those two 'verification' deposits into my account to go through.  My father had to wait almost a week before the two deposits showed up for him.
However, that process can be much faster if you verify your bank account by logging into it.  I know that process works with Chase (Coworker used it) and he was able to buy right away.  I don't, however, know if it works with all banks.

The general advice you'll find here on mining is to just take the money and buy Bitcoins directly. Typically, you'll never return a profit due to shipping delays and electricity cost.

One person doing it isn't spam.  That one person trying to get 90k people to do it is.  You're almost trying to organize a DDOS on their support staff.  You want to overwhelm them to the point where they can't properly process regular requests.
I'm going to a conference this week that has Netflix as a sponsor. In one of the many talks they are hosting, I'll repeatedly ask them to accept Bitcoin. I'll go to their booth every 10 minutes and ask them.  Do you think they'll take my request back to people in charge?
Instead of overloading support staff with a question, why not put together a petition?  If you approach support staff and say "I've been able to collect 90k signatures of people who would like for you to accept Bitcoin," I think you'd get a better outcome.

So, while there is going to be a set of keys stored somewhere on your phone, they're not the key that was used for the attack mentioned in the article.

I have an reoccurring buy at Coinbase for every payday for the next six months.  I'm not trying to 'play the game' and get instant gains.  
My interest in Bitcoin isn't really about money.  I find the protocol/network to be interesting.  I've had a lot of fun setting up various cold storage methods and building a customized LiveCD for Bitcoin related things.  The amount I've learned and the entertainment I've had has definitely been worth the 2% I'm 'investing'.

Bitcoin does have instant transactions... I think you meant instant confirmations.
Unfortunately, due to propagation of the blockchain, instant confirmations just can't happen and still keep the network chugging along.  As more transactions happen, more data needs to work it's way around all the nodes.  That is why we have a 10 minute block average: to give everyone time to catch up to what happened with the last block.

Bitcoin is Bitcoin because of the blockchain.  If someone copies the code and starts their own, it becomes just another cryptocurrency based on the Bitcoin code... which there are already a bunch of.
Take a look at Litecoin.  They made minor changes (SCrypt instead of SHA-256, 2.5 minute blocks instead of 10 minute) and it became a whole new coin.
Even if they copied the Bitcoin code verbatim and changed nothing, it still wouldn't be Bitcoin because it wouldn't be using the Bitcoin Blockchain.
Hopefully that helped clear up some stuff for you.

You're correct that I am annoyed by your post, because it happens all the time and you got so butthurt by being told it was a bad idea. You've ignored any advice that was given.
I would have signed a petition if you had presented one. Nope, you don't want to do anything more than to get people to annoy customer service reps. Even if the cause is a good one, suggesting that sort of action is irresponsible. 
You completely ignored the petition suggestion, which I assume is because you just stopped reading. 
If these sort of things worked, we would have had season two of Firefly **YEARS** ago. It is not an effective method.
You're fun.
EDIT:  I wanted to clarify my comparison to a DDOS, so here is some math that might help.  Not trying to be a dick, just wanted to illustrate.
If all 90k subscribers here were to contact Netflix over the course of a month (like you suggested) would result in ~3000 request per day.
    90000 request / 31 days = 2903.225 requests per day
That averages out to be about 1 request every 30 seconds.
    (31 days * 86400 seconds in a day)/90000 requests = 29.76 seconds per request
Having spent the majority of my 20s working in customer support for a couple different ISPs (mostly reporting/development but a few years on the front lines) I know that it takes a great agent about 30s-90s per ticket/email response.  For a phone response (which I am unsure if Netflix provides) you're looking at no less than a couple minutes.  
For this example, let's just assume that they're only taking 30 seconds to respond to each contact and they are all email.  Your suggestion has now duplicated the amount of work that has to be done in a single day by Customer Service.
    2903.225 request per day * 30 seconds to respond = 87096.75 seconds spent responding per day.
    87096.75/(60*60) = 24.19 hours per day required to respond these requests.
And... that is just the additional volume that you have suggested. Even if 50% of this subreddit participated, that would still be a 50% increase in the normal, expected work for customer service. 
So, how is doubling the amount of work that a service expects not a way of denying service to the normal flow? This is how I can justify calling this sort of plan a Distributed Denial of Service attack.  Even if you try to pretty it up by calling it the slashdot-effect or reddit-hug, it is still denying service and causing a lot of additional work.

My understanding is that with QRK, the vast majority of them are held by a select few.  These coins were mined before it went 'public'.  Now that it is public, a select few are simply selling off their coins to the people they talked into it being a good investment.

Welcome to Next time your post will probably do better if you're more descriptive.
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:41:54
Your argument is flawed.


More a protocol.  You wouldn't call TCP/IP a "webpage network". Read more. Learn.


If there was only one pool that every single miner was a member of then, sure...  but, the reality is that this scenario isn't what is actually happening.
Centralization would mean that a pool had 100% of the hashing power and that just isn't true. The simple fact is that you're ignoring the numbers.  There isn't even a single pool that has 50% of the hashing power, so how can it be centralized if there is more than one pool?


These pools are not private.  Anyone is welcome to join them.  Just because someone can't understand how to join them doesn't make it the pools fault.


How can something be the center, yet share it with other centers?  This doesn't make any logical sense.  TALKING IN ALL CAPS DOESN'T MAKE YOUR ARGUMENT CORRECT.  


How can the network be centralized if there is are decentralized pools?  Why do you want to remove "centralized" pools yet allow other pools to exist.  
The argument that you really want to make is that you want to abolish pools entirely.  The sad truth right now is that without these pools, the Bitcoin network would likely die due to a small handful of people with a lot of hashing power would be completing all of the blocks.

If you're not already holding Bitcoins, you may not be able to get it to them quickly.
Are you in the states?  Coinbase is my suggestion but, you'll have to go through verification that may take a few days.  Then you'd have to wait a few days for your first Bitcoin  purchase to go through.
You could also purchase via localbitcoins.  If you want to go the Bitcoin route, localbitcoins is probably your quickest way.
Since neither of you are already using Bitcoin, I don't think this is going to be the best way for you guys.  Would it be possible to load up a prepaid Visa card and mail it to them?  I'm not sure if those things work across borders though.

I have a feeling that by the time you can easily make large purchases with Bitcoin at a brick-and-mortar, 0 confirmation transactions will be acceptable.  
Using a third party payment provider (like BitPay or Coinbase) the confirmations don't matter to the merchant.  The payment processor takes on the risk of 0 confirmation transactions.

As said, the fees are user specified in most clients.  You can set it as low as you want but, the size of the transaction fee helps put your transaction in line.  The higher the fee, the better your chance of getting included in the next block.
The Bitcoin is evolving as times goes on.  As the value of a Bitcoin increases then I wouldn't be surprised the default fee is lowered.

I have never mined.  
Bitcoin is already P2P.  I don't understand how you think making it easier to mine for people that don't understand the impact of mining makes it any more P2P.
Please, before you find another way to try and insult me, how about you show that you understand Bitcoin and provide some input other than "P2P!!!!! DECENTRALIZED!!!!!". 
How does a 'one-click-auto-mine' make Bitcoin more P2P? For the average joe, solo mining will never result in any profit - they will lose money due to hardware cost/failure and the cost of electricity.  Do you think that the average joe is going to continue mining when their GPU fails or their electric bill skyrockets?  
As it stands, the average joe is only interested in mining because it is supposedly free money.  
How does a one-click-auto-mine resolve the problem of the exponential growth of the Blockchain?

Maybe understanding the logic behind your reasoning that the price will drop because Google copied the code would help us try to explain better.
What is the incentive for a business, like Google, to fork the Bitcoin code and create their own?  In order for the coin to be worth anything, you have to have people mining it and using it.  
What would GoogleCoin be used for?  If it is paying for Google services, then what is the benefit for people that don't use Google services?  
How is Google going to profit? They aren't going to take on a new venture if there isn't a way for them to profit from it.
Bitcoin has the first mover advantage.  Why would a company forking the code to make their own coin suddenly be better than Bitcoin?  It is the same code, just with the Google stamp on it.

Thank you for taking the time to put together a thoughtful response. I think this subreddit needs more people willing to listen to opposing thoughts and respond, instead of just downvoting.
Just because there is the possibility they could be bought out we should assume they are already purposely attempting to harm us? This doesn't make sense to me.
We run this risk with every single Bitcoin company.  So, we need to start accusing every single company of being harmful to the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Not requiring trust is a good thing, but a constant witch hunt is bad. How can we expect further adoption if we are going around blaming everyone of being evil? This makes us all just look like a bunch of conspiracy crazies and is going to scare off newcomers.

Let's say you were sending to another Coinbase users.  Coinbase can just update their system to reflect the change in balance for you and the recipient without pushing it out to the blockchain.
As for the broadcast, yeah... by Coinbase.  I haven't experienced it but, some people claim that Coinbase groups transactions together to reduce fees.  It is possible that they were waiting on a few more transactions to happen so they could just group them all together as a single Blockchain transaction.
Hope this clears it up!
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:26:36
My understanding is that your odds of getting the same payout with a different pool are pretty much the same.  You may get more frequent payouts at GHash, but they'll be smaller.
Look at it this way... if GHash keeps growing in size, it is harmful to the network.  If the network fails then you aren't going to be making any money with your miner.
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:05:12
Maybe provide actual sources to support your claim than some random search result page.  With a search string of "us cloud losing billions" it can only be assumed that you're talking about lost sales.

Thank you for the awesome response!
As you stated, pooling is the problem not a single entity. A large portion of the mining community chose to use GHash as their pool. Why is it that the decision of 40% of the miners makes CEX the bad guy?
The miners made a decision yet we are blaming CEX. When CEX provides us with how they are going to help reduce the problem we accuse them of lying or having bad intentions. This doesn't make any sense to me. I'm trying to figure out how CEX is the bad guy here.
We praise BTCGuild for making adjustments when they gained too much power yet accusing CEX of lying when they try to do the same thing.
You're right that my usage of FUD is likely incorrect but, I still feel that the community (which is the actual cause of the problem) should not be spreading doubt or making the community fearful.

I'm not too terribly young (30) but, I wasn't as interested in the internet (or computers) until the mid 90s.
You're right about Opera.  For some reason I thought it came out around 98-99.  Didn't realize it came out in 94.  My mistake. I was still stuck on BBSes with a 2400 baud, so I had no need for a web browser. Once I did have a need for a browser, I avoided Opera due to not wanting to pay for an ad free version.
I was just stating that it was my opinion that the results of the case helped other browsers gain adoption.  Had MS been allowed to continue, it would've been more difficult for third party browsers to gain acceptance.
I guess I was focused more on the judgement of the case than the initial claim. I now see how the initial claim is similar to the AC argument.  It makes sense to me now.

Take a look at computer viruses.  A sophisticated virus will sit on a system for days/weeks/months analyzing the behavior of the human user.  It will then start sending/receiving data in such a way that the additional traffic occurs during times where it wouldn't be noticed.

The reddit community also wrongly accused someone of the Boston bombings and caused some serious problems for them.
I accuse you of purposely attempting to harm the network.  Do I have any reason, absolutely not... but, I don't trust you and you just said that a lack of trust is enough to throw around accusations.
Granted, I'm going to an extreme here but I am trying to prove a point.  If we just start accusing people because they have the potential to do harm, then every single one of us is a potential threat.

The Bitcoin community is probably smaller than the iPhone community.  While some of those lost sales might be related to the Bitcoin, my opinion is that two year contracts played a larger role. 
iPhone users didn't see much value in upgrading from the 5 to the 5S/C, so they didn't upgrade and are just waiting until their contracts are up to get better pricing on the next around.

You only get a reward when you're the first person to complete a block.  Just because you're mining doesn't mean you're getting a reward.
On average, a block will be completed once every 10 minutes.  As more processing power is added to the network, the difficulty of completing a block increases so that it is still averaging one block every 10 minutes.
In a pool, when one person gets the reward, they split it with everyone else based on how much processing power each person contributed to the pool.  In a pool, you may never actually complete a block but will still get some reward.  
Solo mining with consumer hardware will most likely never result in a reward.

If nobody is using it, then it contains no value.  
The system you're looking for already exists, it is called a bank.  Your balance sits on a computer somewhere as a collection of numbers.  You use an ATM to get cash and that transaction changes those numbers.  You're wanting the existing banking system that we have.  You actually think that banks would spring up to provide all of the services you already receive, and not profit from it?
Why is it better to go to an ATM, convert BTC to cash to buy a sandwich than to just pay for the sandwich with BTC?  You're just inviting a third party into the mix that is going to expect a cut.  Nobody is going to provide these services for free.
Good job, you've just devised a plan to take the control banks have over us and give it right fucking back to them.
You've clearly just recently discovered Bitcoin and see it as a way to make easy money, you don't believe in what Bitcoin represents.  It isn't just a store of value, it is a change in who has control of the money.  Why should I have to go to a bank, or pay fees, just to access my money?
If someone had told you in 1990 that websites could be sold for billions of dollars, would you make a website and never show it to someone expecting the value to be a billion dollars down the road?
If you're treating Bitcoin like a stock, you're in the wrong place.  You belong over at @_date: 2013-12-17 21:44:29

Yeah, no transaction fee was specified.  
Unfortunately, there isn't really a good way to cancel a transaction, especially one made via Blockchain.info.  One of two things can happen:  1) the transaction eventually goes through (my last zero fee transaction took about 8 hours. 2) it takes entirely too long and Blockchain.info stops broadcasting this transaction, at which you should get your coins back.

What did you set the transaction fee to?  Too low and it'll keep ending up at the end of the queue.  After some time the transaction will be cancelled and you'll see the coins in your balance again.

Go to bitaddress.org, download the zipfile from the GitHub link in the lower right corner.  Copy the zipfile to a flash drive.

You're thinking about the way transactions with Bitcoin work in the wrong way.  There is no withdrawing from a wallet, only sending.  If you owned a physical storefront, you wouldn't take cash out of someone's pocket, you'd ask them to give you cash.
Your system would simply provide the purchaser with an address and amount to pay (which can be a QR code).  The purchaser then send sends the requested amount to the provided address.  Your system needs to check that the balance has been paid.
Honestly though, use something like Coinbase or Bitpay.  They're established and have a lot more resources to make sure their systems are secure.  If you roll-your-own solution you are going to run a higher risk of something going wrong.
When dealing with money, it is usually best to let it be handled by those that specialize in it.

I'm saying the hype will die down, the price will drop for a bit, we'll have another small bubble and we'll see the price steadily increase.

Yes, you can do this.  Just make sure that if you buy again that you have the funds at the time of purchase.  Don't expect the deposit from your sale to be there.

Let me try a different approach:
How many of us, on a daily basis, actually use cash?  I don't.  I use a plastic card almost any time I buy something.  I swipe the card, it goes through the tubes, hits a computer that says "yeah, he can spend that", and then whoever I bought from gets a promise that the money is theirs.  
[EDIT: ADDED] Change plastic card to a phone and the magstrip reader with a camera (could also be a phone) and you, essentially, end up with the same service as Bitcoin. [/EDIT]  If a bunch of individuals can get together and provide the same service, why shouldn't we use it? It gives the control of our money back to us.

1) Mining is validating blocks (transactions) and the first person (or pool) to do it receives BTC.
2) Transaction fees.  In addition to the BTC reward for being the first to confirm a block, the transaction fees from that block are paid out.  Once all BTC have been mined, miners will rely on these transaction fees.

I can't disagree with you on that part.  The problem I've discovered is that a lot of places say dedicated, but really aren't.  Most virtualization software will allow you to oversell with the assumption that most people aren't going to use the full resources.

The problem I see with investing in Bitcoin right now is that it could crash to zero at any time.  If I'm spending my Bitcoins as I get them, I get the immediate value out of them right then.
During the last months this hasn't worked out to my advantage, the price is all over the place.  They would've been worth more had I held, but nobody knows when it could crash to nothing.  If the bubble popped, I would've lost money.  With the market being so unpredictable, I don't think it is the best investment opportunity.... now.  Once it stabilizes, different story.
Using Bitcoin as a currency right now may not be the wisest in the short term.  I paid a coworker $5 in bitcoins for a spare pack of cigarettes he had.  That was when the price was $740/bitcoin.  Whoops.
However, I believe that showing showing all of the utility of Bitcoin, at this stage of its life, is the best way to make it a strong, long term investment.  I hate the gold comparison, but it kinda fits here:
If the people that were first discovering gold knew it could be worth a lot had simply sat on it as an investment, would it be worth as much as it is today?  I don't think so.  The usage of gold for various things coupled with its scarcity leads to a higher value.  
Is something being scarce the only thing that makes it valuable, or does the utility of it play a role?
Since Bitcoin is intangible, the more utility that we can show it provides, the more valuable it becomes in the long term.
Don't get me wrong though, I'm not spending all of my coins.  Half of any bitcoins I purchase go into cold storage, as an investment.  The other half is used to help make sure my investment was worth it.

You have to remember that you're just talking to a representative.  They usually only have access to fewer resources than a developer/system admin would.  
Your typical customer service rep doesn't have the ability to fix the more unique problems.  Depending on the issue, the best they can do is push it up the foodchain.  With a team as small as Coinbases, I wouldn't be surprised if each of their developers took on a more specialty role.  "Shit, Jim could fix this in minutes but he's out because his daughter is sick.  Larry kinda gets it though, so he can look into it."
This is a poor example, but here goes anyway:  Suppose Coinbase has 100 servers, and each server handles the transactions for 1000 people.  If one of those servers has a problem syncing the blockchain, then only 1000 customers are affected.  Is it worth causing potential panic with the 99% of customers unaffected?
Once again, I'm not saying you weren't having a legit problem, but in the grand scheme of things you were most likely in the minority.  Sometimes the PR impact of a small issue can be more damaging than the actual issue.
All of that said, I hope things get cleared up for you soon.  Sucks to find yourself in that sort of position.

I agree that spending cash first makes sense... but you said you would NEVER spend then, then followed saying you would sell them for USD.
How is spending BTC any different than using BTC to get USD, and then spending the USD? You end up getting the same goods, at the same cost but now you're adding an additional step.
If nobody actually spends Bitcoins then they effectively become worthless. If you want Bitcoin to succeed, and profit from the rise in price, then you're going to need to spend a few.

Bitcoin is still an infant compared to other currencies, still trying to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up.
The fluctuations we've been seeing are due to interest in getting rich quick, not interest in Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:04:05
Coinbase is going through some major growing pains right now.  They have had a huge influx of new users and it is a pretty safe bet that they are always backlogged.
Their automated system to determine fraud is a little strict but, I don't blame them.  They have to make sure they are as clean as possible by following AML laws and whatnot.  
That said, they will get back to you.  When they do, they will honor the original price.

What if my address lives on Chain A but, I try to send to someone who is only on Chain B?  Without crosstalk between the two chains, then they essentially become two different things.  
If it helps, think of each of the altcoins as a fork off of Bitcoin.  I can't send Litecoins to a Bitcoin address.

Bullshit.  Just because the word Bitcoin is in the image doesn't mean that your post ISN'T about Dogecoin.
If Dogecoin is not the main focus of your post, then what is?  It sure as hell isn't Bitcoin, thus the sidebar rule stands.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:24:34
With the way things have been going today, they're most likely just backlogged. It's hard to anticipate how many orders are going to be processed a week from when you purchased.
I'd give it at least a couple more hours.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:20:12
The closest to getting a private key via Coinbase is to use them to generate a paper wallet.  It would be a fresh private key though, so you'd have to send some coins to the resulting address.

I see you have years of experience actually working for a company that provides these services. /s
I, however, do.  I know for a fact that a lot of providers oversell resources.  How do you think most providers are able to give you such a great deal?

I see... so a few dozen bad experiences make them a scammer.
You've just labeled every possible service as a scam.  People have bad experiences on Reddit all the time, so I guess Reddit is a scam.

You might be overlooking one of the biggest benefits of Bitcoin - Putting control of money back into the hands of the people that earned it. I feel that taking the control of currency out of the hands of the few, and into the hands of the many is a big positive for human development.
I'm digging your enthusiasm!

they probably dump the results of the blockchain into a database periodically (probably after each completed block).  Then, instead of querying the blockchain on each request, they can query their database.
This is just an assumption.
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:04:11
It may be a convenience fee, but they also charge a fee on top of the purchase amount, so who knows.
Depends on how they have their system set up.  If they immediately buy from an exchange when you make your purchase, the price they quote may be higher than the exchanges to help guarantee a quick purchase.
Maybe, instead of basing it on the last trade value, they are taking an average of ask values and saying "let's go a buck higher than that".

To add to this:  I don't believe Coinbase actually ever has access to your login information.  I know that in the case of Chase, you're actually logging in on a Chase site.
It is kind of similar to how you can log into a lot of services with Facebook.  The service never has your Facebook login information, they just direct you to a Facebook login and then Facebook tells the service that you're legit.
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:59:36
During this volatility, using a service that converts to cash is the best option for a merchant.  Bitpay and Coinbase offer these services.
If the merchant has an interest in actually keeping some bitcoins, I know Coinbase allows you to set an amount to keep and only cash out transactions if your balance is above that threshold.

Sure, but then what is the benefit of forking the chain?  Is the overhead of adding the crosstalk between the two chains worthwhile enough to justify the benefit of the fork in the first place?

The harder you try to convince someone that isn't interested, the more it comes off as a scam. For me, I just talked about it.  Provide information, answer questions and let others make their own decision.
As time goes on, more of my friends/family are interested.  The first time I mentioned it to my grandparents, they were incredibly uninterested.  Last week, when they asked me what I had been up to I responded with, "just reading up on Bitcoin and watching the charts."  They got excited and started asking questions.
When I was going to faucets for coins, I'd periodically tell my father "I've now got $1.32 at the current exchange rate."  After a while, my father started asking me how much I had, what the exchange rate was, etc.  He asked where I went to buy my coins and then the next day I get a message saying, "Shit, I should've used your referral code at Coinbase."
The best way to get someone involved in something is to make them think it is their idea.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:54:17
1) I've noticed the PIN rejection before but, mostly when I'm in a spotty coverage area.
2) I've noticed the pricing problems too.  If I can't scroll through my transactions, I just assume I'm on a shitty connection and waiting for it to download the pricing data.
3) The notifications piss me off.  If I enable Android notifications, I now get two notifications.  One when the transaction actually occurs, and another when I load the app.
So, looks like I am experiencing the same issues.  I'm a Sprint customer so I just figured it was shitty coverage. 
I'll check out Mycelium.  Thanks for the info!

With the way the market is right now, spending makes absolutely no sense from an investment point of view.
My concern with viewing Bitcoin as a stock is that besides owning bitcoins (shares), what do you actually have stock in?  If it is the network, what is the network worth if it isn't being used to send coins?
I've run out of steam and I think I've added as much as I can.  Thank you for the good discussion.  I enjoyed it!
