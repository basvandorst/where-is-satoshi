They manipulated the price so that everyone betting that bitcoin was about to go down just lost all their money. 
This usually happens because they borrow 2x-100x their bet (leveraging). They use your initial bet to pay themselves back in case you are wrong (your bet is now collateral).
So if you are betting the price is going down and the price moves up instead of down, you have to give away some of your initial bet to pay for the leveraging you did. Soon, if the price kept rising, your entire bet could be taken to pay back for your leverage (liquidated). 
The more you leverage, the faster they liquidate your funds used for the short.

No, no, no. It is not that simple anymore. When they say bitcoin is revolutionary, you still seem to be taking it with a grain of salt. 
Every corrupt government would love to see cryptos disappear but it is impossible to get rid of. So what can they do? Oh yeah just make it illegal or tax the shit out of it right? However this does not come without ENORMOUS risk or trust me it would have been done by now (it's been a decade). You see,  we the people have never had this much power before. They cant just scare you anymore with threats to freezing or confiscating your bank account anymore. If they do,  they risk turning everyone into criminals or forcing citizens to leave their country to a different one like Japan that is embracing crypto (China tried banning bitcoin twice. Both times we saw reports of Chinese LEAVING to Japan or somewhere else). We can EASYILY hide our money if we wanted to now but WE can choose to play nice now. We decide to pay our taxes whether they agree with it or not and as long as they don't upset us, most of us I'm sure are paying their taxes, including me. It would more likely be more beneficial for them to be more lax with it but it just hurts them so bad knowing the fun is over. Those that can't fathom it will continue fighting until they realize paper IOU's are DONE. Others will embrace it even better and have a much brighter future. US seems to understand that this technology was needed REALLY FUCKING BADLY,  they just don't like not having the power to print bitcoin. I believe US will handle this good though. They might try something to take control like US coin but people will eventually realize not even US coin is as valuable as bitcoin or any other decentralized crypto.

Thanks to bitcoin, I think manybof us will realise money requires a good amount of responsibility to not only keep it safe,  but become more and more valuelable.

It's not fiat bills, it's ethereum tax. Better yet,  ethereum is the gas to run your project that is running on the ethereum blockchain. Since ethereum is always being spent,  it is harder to hold to increase it's value since real users of ethereum,  not investors,  use the ethereum up for their personal projects. Ethereum is going to have a lot more competition than bitcoin that's for sure because ethereum succeeds in the fact that everyone is still new to the space. A few more years people will be like,  "why am I building my coin on ethereum when I can make my own? " by that time I bet even a 13 year old kid could make their own blockchain using many open source code to make their coin without ethereum help or the need for "gas". Ethereum's days are numbered no doubt about that. I give it 5 years before it come crashing down unless they can figure out some way to keep people wanting to build on ethereum blockchain.

the republicans haven't passed much and already have added another $1 trillion to the deficit according to the debt clock. Really the debt doesn't matter anymore when you have money just under a system of control. The numbers don't check out anymore they just print up money every day digitally. This deficit was a problem as soon as it was over $1 trillion but now it's just there to eventually catch up with us.  We shouldn't be arguing who spent more trillions to the debt count,  we should be arguing on Wtf just passed yesterday because there's more than just "tax cuts" passed from that bill.

This is something people fail to accept,  and that is bitcoin (and many, many other alts) do not scale. Once the users come, it will bloat any network.  Just look at the high and mighty Ethereum right now. It took only 1 app to bring it down and there are thousands more coming. If the network becomes to demanding (like increasing block size),  we will need more and more powerful equipment to run nodes. Now if we manage to keep up in technology to handle the block size increases, it doesn't matter because the only people who could afford them will be people with money. Eventually you will upnthe block size so high only a few players control the nodes and boom. There's your 51% attack. Also doesn't sound very decentralized anymore does it?  Not to mention poor countries and villages around the world are able to afford the equipment to node up the area.
Now lightning seems like its no longer bitcoin but doing a transaction on bitcoin is still there. Lightning is more like a tool or extension we can use to make instant and free micropayments. If you want to make a big secure payment,  the network is still there for you but to be able to run thousands of baby transactions is just not possible. Again this might make alts look enticing but don't forget how much stress bitcoin network currently has. Those alts will bloat up as soon as the transactions start flowing in. Even BCH has a few blocks already filling up at 8mb. That 8mb will be the new 1mb and they will increase and increase until they have 1 Peta-sized blocks that have to be processed in under 10 minutes,  every 10 minutes. We will fall behind by that time to handle it and if we don't,  again who will adore to be able to run that node?

Not much apparently. The higher the price of BTC gets, the harder and more risk there is to short bitcoin. Also the price drop was most likely due to bitcoin hitting 10,000 in eruos. We are starting to see though that the hodl is strong in bitcoin though.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:54:59
Good damn it goes many times must this be said??  Raising the block size IS. NOT SCALING! your comment is EXACTLY why we can't just do it as a temporary solution because us noob dumb apes will be like "Oh so big block is the answer hurrrr! ". 
BCH has a few blocks already filled up 8mb. 8mb is already becoming the new 1mb block. Remember BCH (or any coin for this matter) is very low in users compared to what is coming. If you seriously think 1 gig blocks are years to come you are mistaken. Also if you encourage to buy things like coffee or $1 items, 1gig blocks will easily be the new 1mb and it will keep increasing to handle those. Lighting will allow me to pay 100 satoshis if I wanted to,  instantly and free. In today's age,  machines will be making hundreds of payments per second and there will be thousands of machines doing this. Hundreds of thousands of transactions per second and that is just machines. And we aren't even talking about people yet. Transactions we see on any blockchain right now,  that's nothing,  not even .001% of whats to come. 
BCH won't even work being a centralized payment service and this is because we will eventually not be able to process the block in under ten minutes thanks to all the memory it has to process every 10 minutes.

So your answer is to keep attacking the books, get your $300,000 piece of paper,  and work hoping we still have a pension when It hurts to walk? Nah gramps, thanks to crypto (and other things of course), it has taught me a lot in learning how to take care of myself financially and understand more that you can live comfortably doing what you love. 
My belief is all students feeling doubt in college should have dropped out a long time ago. We have been led to believe college is the only way to success which we all know is far from the truth. The only ones that do succeed are football stars and the people that actually have a dream career that tackle college like its nothing because they are pursuing what they want to do.  Now your other 95% students are realizing just how much they fucked up taking the expensive classes for a job they won't even like. You waste 4 long years focusing all your attention on a piece of paper, plus have to work another 5-10 years to pay back just your college and another 30 years for the house. 
Fuck. That. Life. 
I say to college students to follow their passions. If you need that schooling then you know what you gotta do but I know most of you are hating life and would rather do something else. Go do it!  Be obsessed with crypto or whatever you are good at! You can make a living doing what you love and I see it all the time. Surprised to see more and more people enjoying their job because they think of it a profitable hobby. The point of college is to be successful and I'm sure if you had lots of money, people consider you successful. To me, being successful isny just having a lot of money. I see successful as someone who is happy qnd making *enough* money to support themselves. And I can tell you from seeing many friends and countless others getting dry fucked by college bills working at Starbucks to pay them off. Or just hating life making $200k a year and can't quit becasue they still haven't finished paying their debt and most importantly,  this is what he wasted 4 years of his life and attached a $300,000 ball-and-chain for so quitting seems... counter-intuitive. 
Learn to manage your money (seriously protect and grow your wealth) , monetize what you are good at,  and enjoy a happy life.

Fractional Reserve Banking 101 (this is what the banksters around the world do):
They intend to create quick growth in the economy with loans so people to get a head start with a small business or some other venture. Sounds good right? But where does the loaned money come from? Your checking and savings account of course! They can legally loan out NINETY  percent of EVERYONE'S money in the bank as long as they keep at least 10% (I believe they carry even LESS). On paper, this would work amazingly well. Sadly,  not everyone can pay their loans back. So if they never get the money they stol... I mean borrowed from you,  then how do you get your money back? They print it! Out of thin air. They either ask the fed for more bills but more commonly they don't need to do anything since all they have to do is change the numbers in your bank account appropriately (which still counts as printing since the dollar you spent/recieved is not really there). This is why bank-runs are so scary because if you all went together to get your money out at the same time, it WILL NOT be there 100% guaranteed (why it's also very illegal to scare people into a bank-run). 
So if they can just print your money and mine so it will still be there, why is this so bad? Inflation. If you live in the US or any 2nd world country, you might not know how bad inflation is. That's because in these countries,  they are really fucking smart on keeping the inflation slow and steady while other countries have put their middle-class citizens unable to afford to eat. You could have a family in Venezuela of 5 ALL working (kids included)  and just make enough to be able to eat small rations. This is because their $10000 savings in less than 6 months has lost value to be worth only like $100. This is what inflation does and it happens EVERYWHERE. Here in the US, you don't feel it because it happens slow. The prices we see back in the day where gas was a quarter per gallon or 15 cents for a meal in a McDonald's is not because "things get more expensive", it's all thanks to inflation and not only is it still going, the inflation rates are going UP, which means our dollar is getting more and more worthless faster than before. 
Remember the crash in 07? Where the world came down to its knees and almost brought the entire system down? Maybe but most, probably not. That's because we think everything got fixed and/or we are okay now (I know this because i still don't hear people marching to banks screaming "DEATH TO ALL BANKERS!") but really they just postponed the problem. Not only that, but PROFITED from it! People need to understand what happen in 07 wasn't exactly system failure, but a glimpse into the enormous amount of fraud and criminality actually involved with the big banks and much more. We were able to see proof that our entire market could be an entire lie and completely fraudulent. Not only that,  but it was also a glimpse that our economy is about to really come crashing down. Why? "Why can't they just keep up the fraud and manipulation and save us? Let them do ANYTHING to save my dollars! Please, they can keep stealing our money and rob us blind again like they did in 07 PLEASE!" Eventually,  they can't because Fractional Reserve Banking. The housing failed because people couldn't make those payments their loaned homes. Now think,  how many auto loans, credit card loans,  student loans, or any loan for that matter are out there that people also can't afford to pay? And even with all these losses, stocks just keep going up regardless. There is no money in these stocks, just printed and manipulated to hopefully keep people buying more. But in doing so they are slowly killing the dollar. So they get to choose. Either keep killing the dollar and keep the bubbles in the market going, or let the markets flow naturally and watch them crash to oblivion putting millions upon millions out of work, lose out on their pensions,  and lose out on money. We obviously have no choice but to pick enslavement but as the market keeps doing well and things just go up in piece getting more expensive, it will all eventually catch up with us. 
That's why I thank bitcoin every day because I truly believe its technology is going to SAVE us from the gigantic Jenga tower we have been built on. It's time for THE PEOPLE to take charge of our money. It's time for our politicians to have no choice but to be honest and actually do their jobs. It's time for a new era in human history where a handful of. 001%ers have no control over the money. We have finally *invented* decentralized money. For thousands and thousands of years we have only ever had the idea.
TL; DR: Fiat works by giving debt value (what?). Basically our money supply comes from loans we pay but not everyone can pay their bill (including our government), so they print out more for themselves and the rest of the country gets fucked as they inflate their country's currency value closer to zero. Crypto is the future. 
Also one last piece of advice:
"If you are still paying for something you own, you don't own it."

Since your new let me advise you to stay away from cloud mining. You would profit much more just owning the bitcoin.

No we all know this is the truth. Hopefully bitcoin spreads out more and forces people to educate themselves that it's not bitcoin's fault it is coming down. It only takes two TV stations to say it's an attack and you could actually gas light half the nation. I think Trump is proof. If bitcoin really will be our savior (it's innevitable it will happen),  we need more people to know about how revultionary and disruptive it really is. They could pull off decades of censorship to it making it illegal while being forced to us a crypto created by your government and we would have to wait even more time until that one fails.

You are just a butt hurt fanboy because I am not shaming ethereum. I hold ETH and wouldn't if I didn't believe in it. All I know is it took one app to bring ethereum network to a HALT. This is not a bad thing because now we can see its limits and how to increase them. This is exactly how things improve when problems like this occur so glad to see the enthusiasm.

You might have heard the term "payment channels". Think of these as extantions of the bitcoin network now requiring more trust to whoever is hosting these payment channels. In theory anyone can host a channel and transactions done on them could be almost free or completely free. Either way the people hosting these payment networks will eventually have to propagate where all the bitcoin sit now to the bitcoin network. They are the ones that will pay a fee to the miners every time they do this and they will be lower since there will be less transactions to bloat the network. 
 Basically what they are doing is instead of having individual transactions flowing through the network, we are going to package thousands, if not, millions into one single transaction to the bitcoin network to drastically reducuce fees and speed. We will still be able to send transactions over the network but just when we are moving big amounts of money you wouldn't trust any payment network to handle.  Know if you wanna go buy a coffee and donuts, lightning network is perfect to pay as little as 1 satoshi and it will transfer instantly. 
With lightning:
100,000's transactions &gt; one single transaction (with fees) &gt; bitcoin network

It's just important to note that this is good for Bitcoin's security and this itself is a good thing.

Yeah one thing people forget is both BTC and BCH could be dead wrong although BCH definitely is not only dead wrong but very shady. Also to have nodes everywhere, to be an overkill as you say,  is actually a good thing and never overkill because all it does is increase the security of the network even more. You would think sattleites are fine but it for some reason it went out or changed consensus, it could affect many transactions. You have to remember what we are seeing today is just scratching the surface of hoe many transactions there will be. It will be more than cash by the way, it will be more like water streaming all over the place even as small as a drop. 
Lightning can fail. We don't know yet but if it success remember that as upgrades come, it will be so simple to use it,  people won't even know they are. This is a way more possible scenario than actually scaling on chain. It's funny too because SegWit is pretty much an improvement for onchsin availing yet rarely used. Just strange.

Trust me if you still don't dislike Roger Ver, you still haven't seen much of this dude. Used to respect him but have seen money is what he really cares about and lets it slip constantly. Anyway let's just pretend even though this coin was created to continue exploiting mining by very mischievous cats, we gotta see how the community can benefit with the coin. After all,  decentralization and your choice of cryptocurrency is what it's all about right? 
Lets just stick to technicalities and ignore everything else. More specifically, big block size. Increasing the block size simply makes the network more demanding. This is not what you are supposed to do since now you are relying our technology keeps up with these increases and not just that but this new tech has to be cheap so that it remains closer to decentralization or then you will have bitcoin cash Inc. doing all the mining and verification for all transactions on the network. 51% attack anyone? 51% attack basically means they have turned the coin into a Federal Reserve Bank. Why? Because with over 50% of hash power, that entitiy has the power to manipulate any transaction they want. If they want to refund their coins, cancel other people's transactions, or even create you own transaction and  stealing from other transactions,  it's all possible with a 51% attacks. 
Anyway why is it better to keep the network *small* and less demanding? Imagine in the future how many devices would be connected to the internet. In a few short years, our smart watches will most likely be connecting to the internet by sattleites like cell phones. What if your smartwatch was able to act as a node for bitcoin making Bitcoin's decentralization and security durasticly increased. This would be more beneficial for 3rd world countries since they most likely will struggle with the hardware side to propagate the network and remaining secure at the same time. We are already hoping more and more hardware scales so we can propagate the network on more devices and cheaper but instead bcash is working against itself by making  their network more and more demanding hoping *they* can at least validate the network. There are already a few full blocks at 8mb and soon 8mb will become the new 1mb and so on. Even the bcash technical supporter Craig Wright has said bcash should have 1 GB blocks NOW. They want to be this fast and cheap payment processor but what they and people fail to realize is this technology is already here! We can do this multiple ways!  What is the crazy part about cryptocurrency is that it is decentralized and as far as possible from any form of control. Sure BTC isn't perfect with decentralization as its still in development like every other coin but bcash is going the wrong way! They want to be visa and have stated that it's okay that one entitiy does all the confirmations. Okay you still okay with that? Okay that bcash is a centralized crypto because you get cheap and fast transaction times? That is really your decision. What isn't your decision though is how many transactions there will be in the very near future. We are going to be doing thousands upon thousands of transactions per second. And this will just be computers! Machines alone will be doing automated transactions by the thousands and as more people adopt,  we will be doing millions if not BILLIONS of transactions... per second. How big you think bcash block will have to be to even handle something like this? I would be impressed if even one giant entity had 98% hash power could handle such a feat. Bcash will add lightning just you wait. One of the biggest reasons to go bcash is because lightning "is not what bitcoin is supposed to be". Yet,  I guarantee you that they will want to add it. At that point why would you even need bcash if it's just copying bitcoin now? 
Bitcoin needs layers,  it all can't be done on chain. It just can't or you risk decentralization and security and that is what it's all about. And if you disagree and for some reason want a centralized bitcoin for cheap transactions now, it won't matter because eventually that block will be a Peta byte block and you will need a machine that can propagate that block in under 10 minutes,  every ten minutes.

This is one major way to get adoption that most people don't see. Fraud in charity is widely known and even done by large organizations like the Red Cross did with Haiti. Thanks to Bitcoin's transparency, a voluntary-made public address can 100% guarantee the money was indeed used for the charity/related expenses and not for something else.
 This is just one thing trust-less can do and donations need a feature like this. It might even encourage more donations since people will have absolute certainty that the money is being used as the organization claims.

Yeah this was the real death of bitcoin. Mt Gox (the only major exchange at the time) goes down losing everyones bitcoin. Of course the real believers and the ones that understood the technology knew the network itself was fine. To your average investor however this thing was junk,  a scam. Bitcoin is dead. Just like the media said, they were right, at least for a good 2 years.
There was a silver lining to this. This let bitcoin remain underground while everyone laughed at the losers playing with it, making improvements and fixing bugs. Keep laughing and load up fellas. Bitcoin isn't meant to be sold, it's meant to be a new money. You want early profits? Then sell it. You believe in this project?

Eventually we will have multi signatures wallets; third parties will guard one of the keys so transactions must go through them with you4 choice of verification. This let's the third party charge fees like a bank (whoever adapts faster) and can cover your coins with insurance if for any reason you have an issue. If they can trust their security with the keys, that's future banking right there. Actually doing their job and guarding your money, not taking it to the casino and try to make money with it, even if they wanted to. This is why banksters really hate bitcoin.

heres the thing though. Crypto is so fluid and flexible, it is basically all types of financial instruments, to just one specific kind like cash.
For example, when you give someone in the room a piece of fiat, lets just say $20, would this be considered a taxable event? what if we just keep handing it back and forth to each other. is that taxed every time? If yes, would these people want to report this? you dont need to answer to me.
 This is basically what has happened to crytpo. Simply just trying to move it, even to yourself, is considered a taxable event. When you really start to understand crypto more and see just how many coins there are going to be, just how easy it will be for children to hold these "assets" as well that just came out from their class project or simply a club, and how much will be moving completely off their institutions of any kind, heh, good luck trying to suck the wealth out of all those transfers.
These tax laws dont make sense in the crypto world because to report every time it moves, jesus you simply have not yet realized what crypto is going to do in the very near term future and imo they know how ridiculous their tax rules for crypto are but wanted to buy in so they do this bullshit tax law to keep people froszen or scared to jump into the market. We will know if this was the case once they change their tune when they got their fill in the market, or just see how lost they really are when they keep the same laws or double down on tax laws and make a terrible mistake for putting a fat cap on the movement of money in/out of crytpo. Their choice how they want to handle it, but crypto will be fine and exponentially improved regardless.

It will be possible without a doubt. Back then when the internet started,  I bet you could tell the smartest people what we have today and even they would be like "hmm maybe idk". Bitcoin is still brand new and improvements will come as for fiat it is not improving,  just showing how worthless it is every day. If everyone right now went to the banks to get their money,  it wouldn't be there. Guaranteed. We now live in a system that changes your account balance by simply turning the zeros into numbers fooling you into thinking you own something. I actually think the crash would have already happened if bitcoin wasn't around. Now that fiat faces certain extinction, they can't pull "the biggest theft of us history" anymore. They have to be careful people don't panic, countries still accept US dollars (if this happens buy gold/bitcoin/anything!), or stop printing money (buy bitcoin!).

If you think about it, it will be extremely hard to go against bitcoin now. They have to also remember this is a globally recognized currency and have to be careful with labels. One wrong move and an attack can back fire. 
Something people also forget is that other than criminal use and tax havens, they actually saw that the technology is best for the greater good (banks will fill the pockets to who  go against it). I think the only regulation we are going to have (in the future) is simply showing your public history to your accountant which I absolutely don't mind since my coins are still safe.

We already pay taxes on a purchase though. The problem with crypto is that it is everything and it is one thing at the same time. Crypto is so fluid and fast that putting any tax will be hilarious to try to track. 
Best thing I see they will try to do is make their own coin but this could dangerously backfire and give bitcoin some credibility. They need to adapt as friendly and easy as possible and I think they will do this, as soon as they have loaded up with a sizable amount of course. Being simple is the best course forward especially for a space that can hide your money and it only gets easier every day. 
I recommend simply calling it a brand new asset, cryptocurrency. It is that simple. You pay taxes anytime you make a purchase, like with fiat, and when you exchange it to another asset class other than cryptocurrencies. Exceptions can be added as time goes on but to start, it must be as simple as this or risk losing a stronger position in this new global market.

This is exactly why there exist bitcoin cash. I believe there are two possible futures and now that I think about it, Bitcoin cash actually has a chance to beat bitcoin. Reason why is that Bitcoin is trying to be everything which basically is also trying to make alt coins obsolete. This is the risky part because this plays two possible futures:
* People decide too many currencies is bad. Therefore 
 Bitcoin will be very successful while Bitcoin cash will literally be an alt coin
* People accept a new way to look at money and accept different alt coins for different purposes. Bitcoin cash will win in this because it acts safely as a store of value.
Both are very possible and I think its even possible for both of these predictions to happen and even crazier breakthroughs we haven't even considered.

We don't have it to only "dump" it to some poor investor later on, we invest on the idea that bitcoin will be a global currency and would mean that the value of said currency to balloon; the reward for adopting first.

Don't forget to pay attention to anything that gives more power to miners. The main goal is to step away from a single source of power but to spread it further and further to people is the only way for bitcoin to truly be a decentralized currency. As of right now I see miners have a lot of power since they have a high hash rate. In theory this means with enough money you can buy yourself a spot to have a lot of say into how bitcoin should be. 
Also I hate to bring up another problem but bitcoin most likely cannot scale. Period. Bitcoin *was* decentralized for  a while but now we completely ignore the fact that the miners, whatever side their on, hold the power to change Bitcoin. All it takes is money to get hashing power which means the rich get to be on top again. Decentralization isn't a democracy, its just trustless. No NEED to have faith in people, just the system. A trustless and open network. If someone just buys enough miners to hash 50% of the network, it will be DEFCON 5. If they decide to just turn off or even worse dump their coins first then shut down... what would happen to Bitcoin? This is the real problem bitcoin faces and its hiding in plain site.

Hey kid is catching on!
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:03:57
OK... First, bitcoin isn't exactly deflationary. The only reason we say it is because we will forever lose some bitcoin throughout time and no more than 21 million. It has a stable supply nevertheless so it isn't truly deflationary since the supply doesn't decrease by feature. If anything their is currently 1800 bitcoin "printed" into circulation every day. 
Now at some point, bitcoin will stop going moon. This is because (if the stars align) it has become a very real and recognized currency all over the world. Bitcoin should in theory stabilize and won't be so volatile anymore. 
Now the truth is deflationary or inflationary does not protect bad markets. With inflationary currency, everyone suffers since bailouts and printing more money happen. It takes a huge toll on the currency itself. The value of the entire economy goes down. With a deflationary/stable currency, only business suffers but only slightly since I'm sure they didn't fully blast their bitcoin into investment. The worst case scenario is bitcoin becomes more valuable and we lower prices, maybe even wages but our currency and bank accounts are nice and strong. We can jump start the economy over again after this setback for investors and businesses which AGAIN still happen with inflation currencies.
How about loans? This business booms in a deflationary currency even if the rates are fixed so that I don't overpay the value of my loan (ex.  I borrow $1000, pay back $1000 value, not total amount first borrowed). This may seem like they lose but in reality they earn more since  inflation didn't kill the value of the $1000 they are supposed to get. Plus the interest rate on the loan means they will be more profitable than before. 
It seems stupid because we have an economy set up to work with inflationary currencies. You can't just plug in a currency like bitcoin and expect everything ton work out and I'm not saying the transition (if it ever came to this)  would be crazy to adjust to Bitcoin's set rules. 
Also would like to add that bitcoin could very well die in the future but the idea of a decentralized currency can't.

@_date: 2018-06-06 18:47:34
The truth is,  you have to understand how the network remains decentralized . This is thanks to full nodes ([in case you don't fully understand full nodes]( This is what lets a random person have a say in bitcoin, what it is (decentralization), and trust-less validation. 
The problem for us are slow transaction speeds  since they fill up very fast at only 1-4mb in size which also increases fees. Also the value of bitcoin going up will make these fees even bigger. 
BCH's answer to this is to simply increase the block size. Even though it increases how many transactions it can do and lowers the fees, it also increases the CPU power, bandwidth,  and memory needed to run a full node. Now at a minor 32mb, BCH can only do 224 transactions per second. If we really want a global currency to be ran by no one, it will have to be able to handle MILLIONS of transactions per second, without a hitch and virtually free. This is a must.
Now just at 32mb (BCH atm),  running a full node will need a very large hard drive and an internet plan handling 138.24Gb of monthly bandwidth. Anyone with data caps are already unable tinting nodes (including users in US). BCH will argue that these blocks don't fill up completely but they will if they want their coin to be a global currency. Even at 1gb blocks, you have ONLY 7000 transactions /sec (VISA does 24,000/sec). At this size, you now need a device that can propagate that block in under 10 min (every new block comes at ten min) and it will have to download that 1Gb block in under ten minutes as well. If you don't, you fall behind and your node is useless. Does this path sound like decentralization to you? 
Some BCHers will actually tell you that you don't need to run a node. While technically true, not running one means you have to *trust* the strangers node you are using. Does *this* also sound like a trust-less network? They will also tell you server farms are good. HuH??? If you were to put nodes under the power of one entity since the nodes would become way too demanding/expensive to run, they can change, block, or erase anyone's transaction basically turning it to centralized fiat. Not to mention nodes that are all in one area make it easy to be attacked or hacked. The more nodes, the less chance of anyone controlling the network. 
If anything, you want to make running a full-node easier to run; we must spread them far and wide since each one is a heart for bitcoin and running your own is the sure fire way you trust nobody and you have a vote on bitcoin. Making the blocks bigger is the lazy temporary fix that is just turning a blind eye to the problems in the future. Also not to mention the fact that big blocks still doesn't mean instant, verified,  and free payments which is what LN is doing. 
Would it be better to do everything on chain? Yes, that would be preffered but it is not worth making the network more demanding than it already is. Hardware may catch up for block size increases but that hardware may not be cheap for everyone. We want everyone and anyone able to participate? Don't go BCH.

BECAUSE ASSETS ARE ASSETS, NOT WEALTH. the idea that I will hold millions in oil or houses is insanely stupid. What will you do with them when no one is buying. You're left holding poopoo until the prices are back up. This happens every crash and thousands go out of business or completely bankrupt. 
With a deflationary currency, it seems scary because it seems to encourage holding instead of growth. Far from the fucking truth. Wtf is the point of money then? Just to hold it? There is a reason we want it and it's because we want things,  not money. We will ALWAYS spend it. Sure it is possible that spending could slow but at least you won't be broke or penalized when inflation rates go up. 
Go ahead and believe in a inflation economy, see how long people will want a currency that keeps dropping in value. Either way it happens without you thankfully.

ETF: You don't hold the Bitcoin
No ETF: you hold the Bitcoin (as long as you got private keys) 
Even though it obviously makes more sense to hold it yourself, others prefer not holding the BTC themselves and deal with it. They would rather buy an ETF that's like a paper telling you how much you technically own. This should make jumping into bitcoin a lot easier for those that just find it confusing.

You guys... ffs leave him alone. NOBODY and I mean not even Andreas Antonopolous knows the sure fire way to upgrade bitcoin. He had said many times THIS IS ALL AN expirament and that coins could all go to zero tonight,  even bitcoin. Then you guys expect him to talk against bad actors but understand there isn't hard evidence yet published for him to risk sounding like a shill. You guys see the word "coexist" but this does not mean what you think it means. This does not mean they will both be kings worth the exact same.  When Andreas speaks about Crypto, his stance is only on the technology,  not the price. Please leave him alone, he will most likely say something if the scheme comes more to light. Innocent until proven guilty right? And seeing Roger Very go back to bitcoin isn't proof of a scheme,  just proof how BURNT he got with many poor investor's who fall for the shills. Reddit has become full of them and for me,  I blame YOU. Listening to reddit like its the whole world talking. Fake news is powerful and we believe a side to fool ourselves into thinking we know how to scale when this is never been done before. If you actually did the most simple thing like hold BOTH instead of selling, yesterday would have never happened. It was able to because WE like to sound smart and pick sides and attack other coins instead of working to make them all strong and prosperous if we can. We all know the risks of an unregulated market and we don't need to bring down players like Andreas down for our own faults
BTW Vitalic responding and giving congratulations to the people doing the pumps, Wtf Vitalic? Many people's lives were ruined and this guy congratulates the asshole shillers that were hypocrites and went back to BTC!

BCH hard forked today. It's users seemed happy. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:54:44
This. Bitcoin gold to me is the real competitor to BTC. If Bitcoin gold becomes profitable for any user to mine,  then I think it has a chance to offer a more decentralized mining. To me this is all good since the real fight is to scale with the most decentralization and competition helps ensure it. All BCH ensures is quick and cheap transactions, no matter how centralized (as you said they now compete with 99% of the alt coins). 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:19:12
I love competition. It keeps developers making compromises they never would need to do if there wasn't. This helps boost upgrades and bett3r decision making for the users. We want to see fast and low fee transactions and this is the matket speaking saying that bitcoin is taking too long. Now we face less risk of developers/ miners turning bitcoin into what THEY want since they have to compete with other coins to make everyone want to use bitcoin. Competition Is always good and I hope both BTC and BCH keep on competing 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:37:33
Well some good news you can tell your friends is the worst-case scenario is that the transaction won't go through and they will get their btc back. Also can't fully blame bitcoin since bad actors are purposely trying to spam the network to cause this. If there should be any anger, it should be towards them.

That is because HODLers don't actually HODL 100%. The gains on bitcoin are just too good. People sell and eventually buy back more. Sure there are th3 hard core HODLers that never sell but there's a lot of people getting profit by spending it or selling it don't you worry about that.

I honestly think this will bring more popularity than $10,000. Is that crazy? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:43:18
Exactly. For example, I hope my smart watch gets so ahead it has a terabyte of storage and is can access the internet at speeds of one gigabyte,  easily supporting Bitcoin's using my bitcoin wallet that is also a node. As long as the block size wasn't increased,  bitcoin could be validating the network right on your wrist. Hopefully bitcoin cash didn't depend on the big block increases too much. And worse if they do a 180 and copy what bitcoin is doing that would probably destroy BCH. Really though this is all still speculation, I could be way over my head with a bitcoin node on every person in the world... 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:06:29
I hate to say this but finding the correct information on reddit is a needle in a haystack. I too couldn't understand how it is not the solution. It seems so simple. But as a wise engineer once said, "The simple answer is only temporary." Had to do a lot of digging to find why we can't, even risky for a simple 2mb. If we do just a 2mb upgrade just for now to keep people happy, then imagine the fun big block supporters will have probably saying, "SEE TOLD YOU BIG BLOCKS IS THE ANSWER!" and this could fool people more into thinking that big blocks IS the way to go! We are all still very new to this technology and yet to completely understand the scaling issues but we like to act like we know what we are talking about, especially with all this money involved.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:58:42
This is insane. How is no one affected by this? Every single penny has to ethically be used for the project alone. It should have been spent but I guarantee they look at the stack and are like "technically when we got this money it was only $200,000 so we keep the rest" is no excuse and If I donated I would take serious action. 6 years and its STILL in development? With all that appreciation I figured they would be done by now no? How do you guys not care about this? Be unbiased for once.

If you think bitcoin can't fail,  then you are just as delusional as BCH holders. We honestly don't know if only letting people with high capital to mine is good for decentralization. Yes you make a good point about attacks but you honestly don't know how this will play out in the future. No one does. I actually think there is a place for coins that try to be profitable even with small setups encourages more individual support.
Also my last comment was in agreement with you and only meant that bitcoin gold has a much better chance at replacing bitcoin than BCH did. Kind of meant it as an insult to BCH. Really don't believe bitcoin gold will overthrow BTC since this space is still relatively new and everyone begins with Bitcoin. However in the future once regular people have a knack for cryptos, Bitcoin will be put to the test. I feel decentralization will be very important in the future and I really do hope bitcoin will be unstoppable I really do.

There is a famous quote from a well known French philosopher (Voltaire) that quotes:
"All paper money will eventually return to its intrinsic value: zero."

Yes because no one takes *time* as a factor. How long is a currency supposed to last for? As long as possible right? We don't want to have money that has become widely adopted then just thrown away because it doesn't scale anymore.  No, we will only accept something you can see for decades. Bitcoin must be EVERYWHERE to be unstoppable, secure, and most importantly decentralized. To be everywhere,  bitcoin must be light as it can be. It has to be inexpensively broadcasted because we have other countries that need nodes and they too need security. We mistakingly look at our comfortable country and forget just how far ahead we already are. Even now we are plugged up with only 0.0001% of the world's population using cryptos, to scale, I believe it will only work if it's decentralized and bigger blocks will make it and unsafe and centralized.

Right now its at 8 mb which gives them 30-35 transactions per second. 1 gb gives them around 7,000 per second. Visa does 24,000 per sec and only does a chunk of the lucky 1.5 Billion  people banked. Bitcoin can bank the entire 10 billion AND countless the countless computers able to do transactions themselves.

once you understand that all people mostly care about bitcoin is the making money part. When this is a factor, people will want to eventually take profits. People with a lot of capital in an unregulated market, whales can plan together and sell to get everyone to sell them cheap bitcoins with all the profit they sold. However the fact that the market is unregulated and global, it will only become harder and riskier to do this.

I think once all this drama calms down and I mean good amount of time needs to pass before we might be able to do that. WE double the block size. Transactions speed up again... for a while. Then it gets congested again and people will want another increase and so fourth giving the wrong idea and making increases in block size the answer. S2x was a trap to start this. Bitcoin needs to get *smaller*. Or at the very least stay as small as possible to prevent the network becoming harder to validate. It leads to centralization of the miners. If Bitcoin was to get smaller, imagine if a fridge could validate the network. Bitcoins security would be UNSTOPPABLE. Imagine a future where almost any wifi device was capable to validate bitcoin transactions. Big blocks is going the WRONG WAY. You are absolutely right that we should do a little increase to stop congestion that's the perfect way to describe what is happening but you risk making increasing block size like its the answer. Face it we are all as a mass still learning this technology and still understanding why bigger blocks is somehow not the answer when it does fix the problems. I hope they are able to find way to "alleviate congestion" as we are all finding a bit (some very) annoying.

Yes lightning will partly be centralized but the protocol itself is secure enough to manage those assets. Bitcoin cash, you risk less nodes and more in control of individuals that if are wble to get 51% consensus,  can then broadcast any block chain they want? All they have to do is find coins that were never transacted again,  put them in their wallets, and broadcast it in the next block. This is just one thing they can do with centralization. Doesn't seem so different anymore from what we have now doesn't it?

GUYS, GUYS the market is as big as bill gates'bank account.  Surely you should know some early adopters were in big but back the coins are cheap so you got A LOT more than what you can afford today. The truth is the market is not so hard to manipulate and nobody can stop them. This, sadly,  is fair play here. Moaning is no different, they are the early adpopters and we're rewarded for being first. This is why it is very important to start learning basics of blockchain so you can tell which is the right block chain. Our hope is we are able to see through any lies and shills going on causing mass confusion on what is going on. 
This will only get better as more adopters come every day and learn,  eventually, more about the blockchain and it's technology and how to be *innovative* of what we have now,  not just clones of what we already have. Remember that. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:42:18
Mining does seem a bit centralized. Almost like only the rich get to really have a say because they can afford the equipment. It's no different with gold. Look at it this way, the Ming is a gold rush and those must spend big money to make big money,  this brings in competition for mining which is all we need. But what about their power to vote? Well remember we have pools as well with people all over the world voting one thing,  if any of these small time miners decide they don't like those rules,  they can give their hashes to the pool they vote for. 1 million people can vote each with 1million gpus combined all voting to protect Bitcoin's core which is to be owned by no one. And that's the power mining pools have. A voice just as loud as those with those that can buy hashes at will. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:01:55
First people will no longer want fiat, they will eqn5 bitcoin or some other crypto. People will quit if they get paid in paper so the only way companies will stay in business is to pay in crypto. They now have to compete with simply being an entrepreneur since making money will be 100 times easier than before. You could make videos,  write articles,  draw, and more to get paid on the net. Tipping will be extremely easy and the main income for some. You would b3 wble to sell your data as payment or sell goods very easily. 
This will have people changing the way we think money and how to get it. Hopefully this just makes jobs have higher wages because some people do love to work but not if they are getting paid in turds. Companies will have to adapt and pay employees crypto and then others will follow seeing that the business is now thriving more than ever.

Yes except paper money is printable,  and forgable. Bitcoin is nothing we have ever seen before since you can't print more and is impossible to counterfeit no matter your status. Even gold today has become fraudulent since there is fake gold and IOU's people buy giving them the idea they hold the gold. 
This is the reason paper money has no intrinsic value, since we depend on humans to keep it legitimate and we are easy to corrupt. Bitcoin doesn't let anyone mess with it which is more valuable than anything we have ever seen

This is BCH in a nutshell.
They think all they have to do is plug a 10 tb hard drive into  their miners and boom, problem solved right? The problem is that you would have to then be capable of validating more memory and it has to be done before the new block comes out. Eventually you will get to 1 gig blocks and for something to process 1 gig per block EVERY 10 minutes would need much more powerful hardware to validate the network. Making the network harder to validate reduces the network's security and most importantly decentralization. 
People are easily fooled because increasing block size instantly relieves congestion in the network and speeds are fast again and fees are low which is what I want too but increasing the block size is no different from a bail out. Its going in the wrong direction. If possible we want to make the 1 mb *smaller* so more and more devices can validate bitcoin's network thus making bitcoin's security indestructible and way more decentralized. Sure this doesn't relieve pressure to the network but increasing block size is very risky hoping our hardware will keep up and even if it does, that means EVERYONE would have to keep up to reduce centralization, and again you cant just go to your local Best Buy and buy a hard drive, your hardware would have to process all that memory in under ten minutes. 24/7. Eventually this will lead to only a few players being able to validate blocks and boom there's your 51% attack.
We have no choice to find another solution for the sake of decentralization. The network must become easier to run, not more demanding.

@_date: 2017-11-13 19:44:07
Both. Imagine the blockchain getting a gig larger every 10 minutes and you have to process all the past blocks as well. both would have to look through thousands past gigabytes in under ten minutes. Every device trying to mine or be a node will have to be capable of doing this and this doesn't even include the bandwidth needed just for nodes.

This is why I actually supported Segwit 2x but decided we arne't ready for it thanks to this civil war going on. If we do a block increase now, many users will think bigger blocks *was* the answer all along. At the same time though, bitcoin needs to speed transactions asap or users will use other alts (I know I do for payments and such). We can always decrease the block size later so it makes perfect sense for the upgrade but that is indeed the big risk about it. People will look at it like bitcoin is folding and proved BCH did the right thing.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:00:44
*if* possible i mean it would actually be more beneficial for it to be smaller but if it is possible I don't know. Not even sure if we need to but what I do know is if we made the network easier to run, the better. The main idea is that raising the limit is not the answer for instant and low fee/free payments.

Bitcoin has crashed (popped) dozens of times. It has gone from $1 to $30 (a 30x return) and then crashes back down to $2. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere and thanks to its deflationary nature,  it will go up in value as fiat inflation pumpsnits price up. Inflation always makes things more expensive and since bitcoin is on a global scale,  people will always short and realize they jumped out of the rocket and pay a heftier price to get back in.

They are not entirely to blame. The community and developers in the space been split for over a year and it was pure confusion. They had to worry about replay pardon and marketing sure bitcoin wasn't able to fall victim to a successful attack. Now that the intentions of these coins are coming to light,  I think core developers can finally continue full focus on the development for BTC. I hope the same goes well for BCH (still have them above the fork) and see if there really is something there or if it was just a manipulated chain.

I'm going against the crowd here but think of this. Commercials come on and everyone loves Superbowl commercials so everyone is watching. Right after a great commercial an ad pops up saying "Buy Bitcoin", maybe with the bitcoin.org address in the bottom. Then in a blink of an eye another commercial comes on and you have half of the people miss the commercial and the rest confused of what they saw. If they haven't heard of it they might just forget about it. Many didn't even get to see there was a website. If they have they might just look at it like a scam just saying "give us your money" (remember they have NO IDEA what bitcoin really is other than "internet money"). Now I'm not claiming everyone will take it negatively. I really think it might just get people to talk about that weird little blimp popped out telling me to buy bitcoin. Honestly might not do much at all but be hilarious to see for the crypto community so I still would be fine with this but I think we can do better. 
Now if you really want to make people run to BTC,  then I think it will take more than 2 seconds I propose a 15 second commercial. This would be around $2.5M using OP's numbers. This is also 8x more than suggested but I think it's the only way to really have a huge positive impact. We need a commercial that leaves the viewers curious about bitcoin. We need to show a scenario that inform them of something extremely revolutionary that bitcoin could do. Get people to be like,  "wait what?" Bitcoin can do that?!" you all know that feeling.  The realization of bitcoin being more than mere money. The sudden flip of a switch that makes you want to know more about the technology. If someone can figure out how to do this in 15 seconds, getting a crowdfunded $2.5million will come in an hour seeing how fast ICO's sell out. I recommend a very serious tone with the commercial. Even just words saying:
"If you could witness the beginning of the internet, "
"Or invest in it, "
"Would you?"
"How about witnessing the internet of money?"
Then show bitcoin.org or some other informative site about Bitcoin. 
Really it can be anything it just has to be good enough to get people to learn about it right away and trust me if people jump in educated,  they will hodl on and many newcomers will lose less money in all this commotion.

Im not actually, remember we are used to seeing transactions from VISA scale and digital fiat is only supported by 1.5 Billion lucky people that are able to quality for a bank account. Bitcoin is trying to bring banking to the other 8.5 billion out there. We will see more transactions than we have ever seen before. It wont even stop there. Machines will also have their own bank accounts and be doing transactions as well. That 1 gig block is not so far fetched as you think.

8 mb= around 30-35 transactions per second. Visa ALONE does over 27,000 transactions per second (about 4 gb). You also have to remember the fact that only 1.5 Billion people have debit cards and another 8.5 Billion have no banking whatsoever. If we bank them, how many transactions you think will be flying in bitcoin especially if it bitcoin was to be the only one used? Don't forget computers can now have bank accounts too and do transactions themselves. Still think you wont see it until 2080?

This has been a threat to any PoW coin (especially BCH with bigger blocks) that a single whale can buy a huge amount of hashing power and do the infamous 51% attack. Bitcoin is the most resistant in this due to how much competition there is for bitcoin now all over the world. Sure now your normal person can't mine a fortune but at least there is still lots o decentralization going on thanks to things like mining pools. People will be in mining pools that support the status quo, if the try to change something, all users have to do is leave to another or make their own. Thousands of little rigs have the power to vote this way.

Guess what,  ITS STILL CHEAP!  Bitcoin has a long way to go and you only need to buy what you can afford to lose.  You don't have to buy 1 bitcoin completely, you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin and that will also accumulate in value. Bitcoin is deflationary and we have never had a money that could do and prove this. And you only have to trust math.

I'll be honest they probably won't need to make them that big until a few years. We obviously know right now, there is but a tiny tiny amount of people on this world using cryptos for transactions. Eventually, slowly but surely, massive amounts of people will start using crytpos. Remember only 1.5 billion people have the luxury of using a bank. we are trying to reach the whole 10 billion people out there and currently we have .0001% of those people on crypto right now. People that have never used a bank account in their life now are able to by downloading an app. thats how easy it is for someone to jump on the network ad add more transactions to it. Eventually two things will happen.
1. BCH will get to 1gb or people will realize before then that this isn't going to work for decentralization and switch back to BTC
2. They copy bitcoin's solutions and literally have their users scratching their heads saying, "why do we even need a BCH if it's just copying what BTC is doing?" and switch back to BTC
Right now these increases seem minuscule but as more user come in (and they are coming), then they will need to keep increasing the size year after year eventually getting to that 1 gig. By that time you can argue we'll be super duper human advance civilization so it will be okay and perhaps they are right, but the issue now is decentralization since Even in that time, people will have to have that new and extremely powerful hardware (and connection) to process all the memory from the past and it increases every 10 min. And it all must be done in 10 min before the new block. How many people you think could afford to keep up with it? Instead, how about the network stays so small that in the future, even your smart watch is capable of validating blocks and securing the network? What seems more decentralized to you?
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:02:00
1 gig every ten minutes. That means the network will get 1 gigabyte bigger ever 10 minutes ( roughly 144 gigs a day) and you have to process the THOUSANDS of past gigabytes from past transaction in under ten minutes. You also have to remember this memory will have to all be download EVERY 10 minutes as well on a network. Even if we are capable of doing it, how many people you think will be able to do afford the hardware and such an insane amount of bandwidth? This is why even if its possible, it leads to centralization due to the fact less and less nodes will be out there and also ruining the networks security. Less nodes, less secure.

Yeah true. These high fees and slow transactions are getting on my nerves as well but when you finally decide to make the switch, how much will bitcoin be worth by then. Even at this state, btc is better than gold and its not even 1% of golds market cap yet. I might get down-voted for saying this but I do use alts for free and quick payments for now but my holding are in btc. Imagine how much value you could lose the day bitcoin releases a stable lightning network or some other solution and when you try to come back your coin might have plummeted while btc went up, how will you make the switch then?

Again I agree with you 100% but we can easily see all these "facts" all over the place. People don't know what to believe or what is the real way to fix Bitcoin. Going to 2mb or even 8mb, not so bad but we don't want to give naive people the wrong idea. When I said S2x was a trap, I didn't mean I disagreed with it I think it was the best solution for this whole thing and probably could have prevented bitcoin cash but now that it is out, increasing the block size even to 2mb will send Bitcoin Cash owners on a rampage saying we are hypocrites and be like "SEE WE TOLD YOU BIGGER BLOCKS IS THE ANSWER!" Then all new and current investors will go over to bch. Sure you and me won't go and will win in the end but many more will lose. I think the time will come when people will finally understand that increasing blocksize is only a temporary fix and we can do one since we can just change it back to 1mb when lightning comes out; if it comes out lol.

Instead think how can I get these cars able to stop from crashing or from malfunctioning to prevent all the congestion? Really we might only ever need two lanes on the freeway in the future with exit ramps. It will be safer and faster than cars and we could be there if we stopped sticking with the temporary solutions like adding more lanes still causing traffic, crashes, and no difference. 
More roads is a good example of temporary fix.

Well to this day his uncle, although he now uses the Euro, still views the amount or value in his old currency. He always has to do the math in his head to see how much money he has or owes because we he is just so darn used to his old currency.

They will most likely talk about the now, how they right now have fast transactions and low fees and possibly some kindergarten-like name calling. Also they will claim we will be technologically more advanced to handle block increases in the future, while this might come true, it wont be cheap and there would be less and less people validating blocks since it will require a lot of power just for a simple node. And not just that but a very powerful connection to be able to transmit all that data, every 10 minutes.
I like to think of Bitcoin like a stagecoach taxi and the two horses pulling the wagon are the 1mb. the taxi driver can only handle 7 customers per day since that's how fast his horses will go. So how could we go faster? Add two more horses of course! Now i'm able to handle 14 customers everyday but its still not enough! Add another 4 totaling 8 horses. Still not enough lets add 16 horses! Well that's where the customer looks at the stagecoach and says, "wow that's a lot of horses! how are you able to make a turn with so many?" The stagecoach replies, "Well i'm sure in the future will will have roads that can support all my horses!". And for some wild reason lets say they did! The world was able to make roads to support 16 horses but guess what, now 16 horses isn't fast enough, I'm gonna need 32 horses now to handle all these new customers. How when they just made them big enough for 16?! Well that's okay, in China, they have roads that support 32 horses so well go there. Then you get even more customers and you need to double to 64 horses now and then it hits you, You haven't found a real solution to be faster, all you did was prolong the problem and you are now back to square one. Instead, imagine if the taxi driver took more time to invent an engine into his stagecoach and now has the power of 100 horses and requires even less space on the road, making it easier to reach other parts of the world. I that engine gets to slow, invent another one that has 1000 horse power. 10 times faster, still uses the same space on a road. This is what Bitcoin is trying to do, its trying to invent this engine that will turn bitcoin from a stagecoach to a car. Bitcoin cash is adding more horses to the the stagecoach. I Hope this analogy doesn't make things more confusing, this is just a way I can explain it.

LMAO you "smart" guys still don't get it. On average no one even knows what a bitcoin is. The ones that do know what it is, a very small amount of those people actually know what bitcoin can do for us and an even smaller amount of people know how it works (coding and nerd stuff as normal people would say). ALL the cryptos out right now are in fetus form EXCEPT Bitcoin which is like a newborn baby (compared to other cryptos). 
I actually think this debate is not an actual debate. It's main purpose is to not let bitcoin KILL its competition. No one knows WTF a etherium is and a slight chance they actually heard the word bitcoin said somewhere (I know us nerds/traders/make-money guys know it but we aren't everyone, we are so small you obviously have no idea) so to say it's days are numbered is kind of pointless since everything really has its days "numbered". 
Bitcoin started the cryptocurrency and 95% of people don't understand the mechanics behind it which makes it hard to trust. A small amount of people are starting to recognize bitcoin. If bitcoin dies,  you could basically be killing ALL coins since people will literally think it's some ponzi scheme or scam. Sure you could scream true facts about how this other coin will fix this and that but the general public will definitely ignore your ass now,  they already do it right now with bitcoin.

I think they messed up financially with the value of the house going up (took money out and used it on something stupid). 
Why would billionaires invest now? They could just buy bonds. They will still invest because at that point when you have everyone using the currency,  the value won't increase like it does today. I think billionaires will never stop investing thanks to them being human and greedy. Someone will always be there to invest in a start up or a business with big dividend payouts. Even inflatable cash is an asset sometimes when the dollar is going up. There is always incentive to invest even if your money gets more valuable but I agree that it makes sense to definitely invest it when it drops in value. 
Honestly I believe we are stuck in these ways and never had a choice since fiat was all we had. Now we do have one and I believe even if you don't like it or not, people will want to use/own a currency that increases in value and our economy will have to adapt. I of course don't know the future but I do know more and more people around the world are starting to hate inflation and there will be another financial collapse that will destroy everyone's investment all thanks to loans and the never ending debt we keep putting ourselves into. Maybe an incentive to not invest so much is what we need to actually have an economy that isn't negative in the books.

I think that's good because I would say at least 80% of the population doesn't invest (not including 401k which I bet most people don't know that money is in a market that could be lost) . Even with a 2% gain in value a year,  this to me is not enough profit for investors and they still will invest in start-ups( which makes you 1000%'s in returns,  sometimes). Like I said our infrastructure looks funky when you bring a deflationary currency in the mix because we have things based that fiat will lose value,  sadly it doesn't work. If you live in the US, Europe, or China things might seem great but other countries can't inflate their currencies properly. Even in the 1st world countries are overinflating just hide it better. 
You have to think for the average person; if you are going to pay someone and you tell them would you rather accept this currency that loses value or this one that increases in value,  which one you think they will pick (they probably won't choose bitcoin right now in this early stage)? I think we need to start trying to think how to work around a deflationary currency because eventually everyone will be against fiat. It's only a matter of time before the ever growing debt catches up to us. We need to focus on changing away from a debt economy and that most likely will have to happen once we hit our collapse because there will be a collapse in my opinion in a year's time. We grow too quick and it's not worth it if it all comes crumbling down for us to worry about it later. If anything this always benefits the 1% of the 1% that save themselves in financial crisis and buy out the drowned market and don't even care once it collapses. They make insane profits,  sell,  let the markets default,  and repeat. 
Honestly I don't think we will have a choice in the future to use a deflationary currency. Like I said who wants to get paid in a currency that loses value? Like I said there may be challanges to deflationary like slower growth but at least the money will be there, not just adding more  debt until it collapses everything.

Since the price of the house goes up, doesn't that mean that your bill does as well? You pay like 70% of your house payment purely in interest and I myself have seen my parent's house payments increase (not rent). Also I simply disagree with inflation being good unless you wanted to keep prices more stable (and they haven't. Prices for everything have gone up in every country but at different rates) but people don't like hearing that their money is losing value, I think they would rather use a currency that goes up in value. How does this work with debt? Simple. You pay back the value, not the actual number. Ex. I borrow 1 bitcoin.  Every month I make a fixed payment of 1/5 of that bitcoin, so I pay 0.20 btc a month. By the second month, the value of the bitcoin is compared with the date of the loan and it has gone up 10% in value. This means I will instead pay 0.18 btc because of that increase in value. in terms of interest, they could probably do a fixed interest plan with a smaller percentage (5% fixed interest of the 1 btc borrowed so .05 must also be payed regardless of the value) or an adjustable interest plan paying 8% on your current payment.
As for deflation promoting stagnation, good! We need some this! We are so stuck on buy now pay later but we REALLY pay for it later on and its not the wealthy that pays for it, its us. Also, it wont stagnate since holding money is useless. People want it to BUY things. Sure if we save it, it could be worth way more down the line but can you really hold your money for that long? Eventually people will spend it, and the best part? IT WAS BOUGHT! Its not gonna fuck them or us in the future when that person can't make the payments and now you have money lost again with another default on the loan. Our current models of the economy look ridiculous using deflationary currency but thats because our economy is fraudulent and just turns to giant bubbles that again, the 99% have to pay for when it collapses. I say we need deflationary currencies to get us out of this cycle. Things only get cheaper with this but no one is losing money because the value of the currency is going up. With a deflationary currency, everyone wins and there is much less danger of a financial crisis when people can start affording more with actually saving money and having a REAL economy with money actually there, not this fake and manipulated economy where they easily inflate the currency well over 2% and everything is being held purely by loans/debt and extra hidden inflation.

A lot more unlimited data plans than data caps here in the US.

I have family in rural areas here in the US that have a 30 GB limit and they pay a pretty penny for that amount already. If they were to run a BTC node,it would already wipe like a third of their cap. Impossible for them to run a bcash node and they are appreantly going to 32mb soon.

Why is a currency that goes down in value better than a currency that goes up? If you are talking about how volitile it is,  that's because people are slowly learning that ANYTHING can virtually be currency. It's at its infancy and it *will* keep going up as long as it gets easier to use (and it is). Once most people undertand this fact,  bitcoin will deflate more stable. 
People don't like money to hold it,  they like it to get things. It's such a simple cycle yet no one understands this. Everybody eventually gets rid of the bitcoin to get what they want eventually and then the next person holds their money until they want to buy something with it. I'm not mad that I bought something with it and it went up in value, it already went up enough for me to get what I wanted. That's what deflationary currency looks like but you go ahead and love your slowly decreasing dollar. Be happy you don't live in Venezuela or Zimbabwe. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:08:39
How much economic incentive do you need? Is protecting the money you are using not enough???  You want everyone that uses bitcoin to run a node. That's what trust-less really means and not only that. With more nodes spread out through the world,  it makes bitcoin more and more unkillable It makes it more and more secure to transact. And most importantly makes it more decentralized.
 I understand that it has a cost to run a full node and I hope that as technology improves, it will become almost, if not, free to run one. Still, it is very important that we are not discouraged to run one if you care about Bitcoin's network.

bitcoin could literally be a souvenir and still hit $1 Million. If cryptos really are the future then the name bitcoin will survive throughout history as the first crytpocurrency ever created. And who would want to say they own a bitcoin? once you have billions of people already using cryptos?
Regardless bitcoin is the most trusted,tested, and attacked crypto which still makes it the safest crypto to park money. Other coins simply are at the idea stage or barely tested. By the time they actually start getting more volume and more devs behind these alt coins, bitcoin is still improving. 
TL;DR: Its like a space race but even if bitcoin loses, it will still be the first crypto ever made. Worst case scenario it becomes a collectible for the future generations.

Let me let you in on a little secret. There is no such thing as a bear or bull market for bitcoin. Bitcoin all is going to do is go up. What we are seeing right now is bad news making it look like a "correction" of some sort.
Bitcoin doesnt work like our normal markets where a company can move the price and be confidant it stays there. Since anyone can just come in and buy it adds FOMO to anyone and everyone. Bitcoins are dissapearing everyday making them more and more rare and we know 100% for a fact this is true because we can trust numbers more than any company in the world.
Stock market is all imaginary we are buying "shares" that can be created through thin air and you hoping everyone is being trustworthy with not creating shares for themselves *cough EMRON *cough* . Bitcoin is the most real form of value since the beginning of money yet because we are so used to fiat and all these other imaginary terms we made up (bonds, shares, stock) is all imaginary.

We have the hardware to possibly handle 1gb blocks. The real issue is if you truly want to spread bitcoin to the world more secure and decentralized, you cannot forget the other countries that don't have the luxury nor wealth to run nodes with blocks this high.
Bigger than hardware scaling, is the *bandwidth* needed. At 8mb you are already kicking out anyone with data caps (including 1st world countries like US) since running a 8mb node will drain 34.56 GB a month of data. Imagine just trying to set up the node downloading the past blocks. Really you want to avoid raising the block size as much as possible and instead try to find ways to fit more and more into that 1mb. If anything making that block *smaller* would be better so we can make it much easier to run nodes. 
The point is to make the network less demanding. Its necessary for decentralization, security, and making bitcoin more and more immortal.

It should be extremely easy to understand but the banks fucked up our definition of loans.
It is very simple: They loan the cryptos that they have. If they don't have enough, then they can't loan. Simple as that.
I think loaning BTC won't be possible since its more of an asset than to be used as payments (where lightning network comes in). They will most likely loan out a crypto of the country's making. A crypto only the government accepts but this won't kill btc since we need something to define the value of all cryptos and btc is doing that job right now.
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:27:29
But they will fill up. I have no idea where you got your numbers from but at a global scale when more and more people start transacting on BCH,  32mb will become the new 1mb (8mb is already there,  34.56 GB a month)  and the block size will keep on increasing.

Yeah it's well known how this technology is potentially saving these people but let's be frank,  crypto holds most of the wealth of US and Asia and yet it's only touching like 1 percent of it. Even places like you mention still had people not believing it and would rather own US dollars than "fake money" although I'm sure they will adapt much faster considering their current situation.
Also have to remember the internet is not done spreading. I think it was like 40% of the world able to connect to the internet.

@_date: 2018-02-14 19:37:29
First off it very important to understand how important nodes are for a decentralized network. Here is a [video]( from Andreas that explains it beautifully. 
Now once you see it is important for people to run their own node, let's talk about why even raising the block size even to 2mb is costly. A node running BTC is processing 1mb blocks. In terms of bandwidth alone,  this is 6mb an hour, 144 Mb a day,  4.32 GB a month. This is already a pain for those with data caps/limited data. BCH right now is at 8mb and thats 1.15gb a day,  34.56gb a month! Just at 8mb you already cut out anyone with a data cap and BCH's 8mb are already becoming the new 1mb. They already want 1gb blocks and that is 144gb a day,  4.32 TB a month. Even at 1 GB, that's only 7,000 transactions per second and this is NOTHING at global scale. 1gb will also become the new 1mb. This will eventually lead to a few entities to run server farms and this destroys decentralization. Even if you think that's not important and don't care that it's not decentralized, remember they can now censor anybody's transaction as they please, double-spend as they please,  or change BCH however they want when they please (basically a Central Bank in charge of the money at that point). But worst of all, every node acts like a heart for the network and you are putting and limiting those hearts into a couple known locations makes it easy for an attack to the network, an Achilles heel.

@_date: 2018-03-20 19:18:48
Remember this is still in the experimental stage and you only have like  .001% of people invested in it,  maybe less. Also a store of value is to...  Store your value. People dont want to spend it instantly.  However, what good is money if you don't spend it? The truth is no one truly  HODLs completely. Eventually people will spend it. With an inflationary currency (also no usecase), you never want to hold it too long since it loses value giving the idea that you want to put it in the economy to keep things moving (hence liquidity). While this is true,  i beleive it is also true for a somewhat-deflationary currency like bitcoin since the point of money is to, well,  spend it. This is much better IMO for an economy to be storing money, not assets. If you really need money for an emergency, you going to buy things with houses, oil, etc.? You will have to sell it first but in an emergency, no one is probably buying or you might have to sell it dirt cheap. Your assets might as well be debt. With deflation, prices gradually fall but it's okay since expenses also fall and wages fall and this is because our money is now worth more. Shares will also decline in price and some will still go up making you even more returns since the money is even more valuable. If a stock stays at a same price,  you are still making money. Also prices won't go cheaper every week or month that passes,  it will  fall very slow at full adoption. At that point,  bitcoin won't make you 10x returns anymore without holding it for years and years. Companies,  government, and people will always have wealth to spend and buy things with prices gradually falling. The want for items goes nowhere,  money is to buy things after all. 
I can see it being much more stable for the economy, not really for the miners though since their pay gets cut in half every 4 years. This will lead them to downsize since they are not making profits and will lead to more decentralization of the miners thanks to this.
Money is a paradox because it's something everyone wants but that is not true. Really, people want things. Money is just how you get them and bitcoin IMO is the answer to a real stable economy not propped up on trillions of dollars in debt so it can all collapse on us a few years later. All the economic growth we have today is fake and the 99% will pay for it eventually, big time.

Some actually are also okay with server farms which is where bigger blocks will take you. They even want 1gb blocks and that will ultimately destroy decentralized nodes. They are going to have a split themselves.
8mb every 10 min is 80mb per hour, 1.92gb a day. Storage space? No problem. *Bandwidth* however, is 57.6 GB a month. Maybe in our country we have the luxury of unlimited data but most 2nd and 3rd world countries have limits on how much they can download. Even storage space since hardware,  again,  seems plentiful to us but not everywhere. Let's say they go 1 GB per block. That right there will screwing many around the world,  even in luxurious countries.  You have to DOWNLOAD a 1gb block in less than 10 min in order to keep up. If you manage that, that's 6 GB an hour, 144 GB a day, 4.32 TB a month, 51.84 TB a year. Setting up a node will take you forever to download and let's not forget other countries pay by the gigabyte. This will give the power to set up nodes to the very few that support it (centralization) and I'm sure not everyone agrees with this over there. 
Get ready for a fork in their community.

You have to understand this is not what makes bitcoin so revolutionary. We already have the most private kind of money and that is cash (before cryptos) . It's peer to peer and private as we don't have to post the transaction online. As important as financial privacy is,  what bitcoin has solved is IMO slightly better than financial privacy,  and that is trust-less. Bitcoin gives no one special privileges and no one can argue/stop any transaction. No one can lie about any payments made like your charity actually donating the money for example. With completely private transactions,  you now have to for example take a company's word that they have said amount of money or they actually made that purchase they announced. With private transactions, you no longer have trust-less. It's like you have to have 1 or the other because one is open (trust-less) and one is closed (fungibility). Both are important and both will be used I believe. Bitcoin might have even more privacy added in additional layers but know it's fungibility will still be under 99% because you still have the open base layer. Bitcoin is still censorship resistant, peer to peer, and trust-less. Do not take the complete transparency so lightly, this is a major disruptive part of bitcoin.

I could also argue that everyone alive today is used to banking and having a centralized entity do handle the aspects of money. The concept that we wont need to trust nobody or need permission to transact seems pointless to many of us on the internet. We have great banking features already so it only takes time to decide to use decentralized money. Events and more word spreads it will slowly swallow the planet.
 I actually consider this part of the internet revolution. Just another stage in how powerful and disruptive it really is. After all, Bitcoin and other blockchains are just networks.

Right now BTC acts as a simple protocol that is completely transparent in where it is making it one of the most secure  trust-less payments that Monero can't ever achieve which also makes it a double edge sword of losing complete privacy. Since Monero hides all transactions and balances, you know only yours. This obviously has huge potential for fraud and crime. For example, we won't be able to know if a charity spent any Monero directly for the charity but this is again the trade off for a complete private and fungible version of bitcoin. 
Both can co exist beautifully with bitcoin providing trust-less open ledgers and Monero for financial privacy. Monero is untouchable by laws because it can be hidden so well. Bitcoin, however, will survive because it is stronger than law. It's absolute. You cannot say a fallacy on bitcoin unless  bitcoin says so and this IMO is bigger than private fungible cash 2.0 (juuust barely though). 
Bitcoin also has the most resilience of any network but this reason is starting to shrink but luckily for bitcoin, It also has the most popularity. Cryptocurrency is surprisingly still unknown to most people and the bit of mainstream it gets has people speculating bitcoin and that's it!  The real investor-type speculators know about the other coins which make them even more nervous because it looks like infinite money at first glance. Bitcoin will easily be the most decentralized coin easily making it a currency. For all we know it could be the global reserve digital gold. Bitcoin does have to scale first however. If lightning delivers then bitcoin hitting $1 million seems entirely possible as people continue to adopt crypto.

This is very legitimate and probably was considered but most likely considered too late. If they were to do it now there would be no point because of the many alternatives we have now and their plan to take control would backfire significantly. The first problem is that they have admitted defeat to cryptos. Sure they own most of bitcoin now but people will open their eyes to this in a big way. Now that there are so many alts that think they have how to be money figured out then the real competition begins and them trying to gain control will be near impossible Now that they have killed the king and split the market up even more having multiple alts being used at once.

It's far from a lost cause, at least for a while. Bitcoin does store of value well because how long it has been running. It has been attacked hundreds of times in dozens of different ways and it is still here. It has the longest track record and the most popular crypto yet to be discovered by millions of more people. This game is just getting started and bitcoin has a long way to go before anything else gains enough trust to replace Bitcoin. 
That being said, lightning not working would be a major upset since it indeed will be a game changer in the way money moves around. If they could pull it off, I believe it will solidify bitcoin as "the one currency to rule them all."

I actually base its ability since the DECADE it has been in use. It has been "killed" so many times, it has way more lives than a cat. In 2011- 2013 if you bought ANYWHERE, you will be a very happy fellow today so I think it was the best store of value...
Unless electricity disappear, bitcoin is here to stay. I actually have so I know that also in all those times you mention, there was always this  one small but extreme problem; trust. For the first time in history I can prove I have a real asset and I don't even need to do it because it does it for me. Gold has so many issues that bitcoin obviously does better and more and is even more rare than gold simply for the fact that we know how many there will be. We have no idea how much gold there truly is but accept that its rare enough. 
Bitcoin has been "hype" since it was worth only $0.001. I listened to it for a very long time and I wish I did not listen to people like you that forget the future will not be found in the past. It seems like you need to do more research.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:12:24
You are missing the point. This confuses new investors and they exploit this. To claim it is better than Bitcoin is fine, all rights to you, but there is no such thing as "The Real Bitcoin". The name of the coin is Bitcoin Cash. They need to do their advertising by not calling themselves the real bitcoin but simply just say, "We believe Bitcoin Cash is a better than Bitcoin." and vice versa. Anything else is very simply described in one word:
Fraud.

Buy a bit at this price. If it drops below $3000 buy all you can. I expect the bottom to be $2500-$2800
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:35:14
Like I said, it is *experimental*. For example,  think about the time gold no longer was the cash it was but now paper. Would you be so eager to trade in your gold for this paper? Probably not. It has to be adopted first before it actually works since I'm sure most merchants would accept gold only. 
Only time will tell if it really is a good store of value where your savings don't lose 50% of its value in a week. So far though, it has made a lot of early adopters a lot of money and we haven't had drops as bad in the past. The price went from $0.02 to $30 (a 1,500x gain) then crashing down to $2 (a 15x loss). Every drop has gotten less and less volitile which is evidence that as more adopt it, it could potentially see a 5% drop to be news. Again, it's just experimental I'm not claiming I know the future but I am optimistic.

You are insane. Bitcoin is not ready yet for me to just start using it to buy things knowing it would have been worth more a couple months from now. Plus spending bitcoin IS selling. Think about it I exchange bitcoin for dollars. That is still looked as selling BTC so why not exchanging it for goods? BTC is at its best right now, a store of value and it does that incredibly so and I don't think anyone would disagree. Would we like to use it to buy? sure! but that time isn't here yet. Bitcoin is still VERY early and saving every little bit of bitcoin is exactly what you should be doing and only spending it to show off that crypto buying power.

I have a lot of confidence in Coinbase since even countless of exchanges where able to audit themselves in the days of the Bitcoin hardfork.

THIS! Bitcoin cannot be on its own the only crypto to be used for everything. If just one little bug or problem happens to btc then it would be like a world economic collapes. We need plenty of different cryptos all bringing their own utilities to the table while bitcoin would act as the main reserve for all cryptos (pretty much what it is now). That way if bitcoin hits a scalability issue or something else we didnt see coming we still have coins like Digibite and other bitcoin mimics to keep the network liquid. Honestly surprised people are even dumping their ethereum.
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:58:17
You have been misinforming a lot of people. Yes, fractional reserve is how they currently operate (and the reason our economy is secretly fucked). This doesn't work and we have seen the proof countless and I mean countless of times. They like doing this because they can give out a shit ton of loans while putting themselves on loans to do so. Unfortunately for them, decentralized cryptocurrencies don't work this way. If they lend out all the bitcoin, what else can the bank give out as a loan?  definitly not bitcoin since they cant ask Daddy FED for some more to print out. It literally is physically (insane how more real bitcoin really is than physical money) impossible for the bank to loan out bitcoin or any other decentralized crypto.

@_date: 2017-09-30 17:28:27
Banks are actually a good think its just that they get corrupt. Banks are great for loans since they know they are getting paid back some way or another. Banks also can be a good savings account that can earn you interest but the inflation of the dollar messed this up. If they use cryptos however, loans and saving accounts will be legitimized from the technology of the cryptos not letting anyone "print" more cryptos.
Sadly for the banksters though is their reign of corruption will be coming to and end and well deserved too they have a lot of power.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:06:56
Nodes are important because it lets you cast your vote on the rules of the coin. Not only that, but adds more security to transactions to make sure all transactions stay legitimate. If a few entities control the ledger (Nodes that hopefully can handle block increases), you have to trust *others* to be legitimate because they can potentially censor anyone's transactions, double-spend, and worst of all, decide the rules themselves. No one could have a say on what bitcoin cash is except the server farm owners and to me sounds like institutions we already have today.
IMO the real technology is that anyone can freely run a node and cast their vote. This is only possible by keeping the block size as small (smaller) as possible to let those even in 3rd world countries participate. I thought that was the point to have the other 6.5 billion out there to run their node and protect the transactions around them. IMO decentralization was the revolutionary technology since we already have institutions that have server farms and BCH is just doing it on the blockchain which doesn't make sense to me. 
Still, I am also happy that we can have forks like this to adapt to what we want but I believe there is still going to be confusion coming to BCH's near future because I have gotten many messages claiming bigger blocks will be more decentralized.

You seem triggered like you own quite a bit of gold or something. Gold has thousands of years which would seem like a great investment and I do believe it is. However, cryptos outclass any form of money in the entire human history. It really is hard to see something digital this way but it is more authentic and real than any money we have used. Not to mention trustless.
OF FUCKING COURSE I'm hoping bitcoin will make me money who isn't?? You are hypocrite to thing you are just in because you believe in it when I obviously believe in it more than you. I have made it clear many times that I am not in it just to make a buck but because I believe "money" has truly been invented for the first time. Before crypto it was just a concept based on trust that DOES  NOT WORK. Check that history again if you need to and you will see how ANY type of money we have used fails. Crypto has issues as well but *new* issues we never had had with money and so far I am seeing great progress of coins proving they have found the right rules to be the best form of money. 
I also recommend looking at more news as you are starting to see more and more important figures realizing the power of cryptocurrency

He believes it will all settle itself out eventually as it should since its a free market and even if you don't agree with B2X or BCH, that's okay since in a real free market we can't decide for others beliefs and opinions.

This is what a deflationary currency looks like. People eventually spend it, or how are you rich if you buy nothing? People will save their Bitcoin and wait to be able to afford something and boom back it goes to anothers hand that will save it until they can buy something they want. 
Usually a loan is static. When the person pays back, they'll pay back the amount tied to that specific date it's owed. They also have to accept that they are paying with a DEFLATIONARY currency (inflationary crypto exists as well but who wants to use money that loses value?). Something people seem to have a hard time wrapping g their mind around that this money is nothing like we have ever seen in the entire human history. This currency will change how we think "money" in every form. Once people are used to it, it will be much more stable. Right now though for like 80% of investors, it's still a stock to make money from. They don't fully grasp the idea that your money's value goes up and up. 
With lightning just around the corner, I say we are about to see another boom in value and I still won't sell. Just HODL on until you need to spend it, simple as that.

The  way to trade bitcoin for ANYONE:
Buy when it crashes. NEVER sell. You will never lose and even a kid can do this.
Now if you can swing it good luck. I used to swing it all the time but now I just swing alts which is way more profitable anyway. Reason you don't want to swing bitcoin is because you will eventually be wrong. Bitcoin is very predictable for weeks and then one day it durasticly changes patterns and keeps flying up and you are slowly cashing out only to realise you got out so early. This could fly to $10,000 in a couple more days. If you think that sounds far fetched, you haven't been with bitcoin long enough to really regret to time the tops.

LMAO! Have you already forgotten? THEY WON'T STORE OUR MONEY ANYMORE. Or at least, we don't need them anymore for that. They wont have our money to loan out to us back only what they hold. We won't even need them for a saving account when you will just need to stake a highly used network like ethereum and earn stake rewards (interest) for staking (savings account). Banks will probably TRY to survive by making their own fiat-like crypto but it will fail AGAIN because as we all know, fractional reserve banking doesn't work. It's cheating to get speed in the economy now and have it topple later. Decentralized crytpocurrency is going to save our greedy asses and hopefully the economy lasts long enough for people to own some crypto or gold. ANYTHING but fiat.

Nodes are everything. Without them,  6ou would already be using China coin right now because mining is heavily centralized on bitcoin. It's a well known problem
Full nodes that are fake/using an invalid blochcain get rejected by other nodes. Those will not be paid one satoshi because they did nothing for the bitcoin network.

No,  you're just like everyone else in the world now that at least understands you use it to buy things. Since her dad buys her crypto from time to time most likely telling  her "you're gonna make a lot of *money* with this when you're older" she knows that it is probably a good idea to buy bitcoin like daddy does.

Exactly. Bitcoin didn't get to where its at today by being pampered, it was attacked as much as those opposed to bitcoin could afford, and built up its resilience to attacks. 
We have to do the same for lightning which is exactly why they recommend only using what you can afford to lose. It's still beta and it needs to build up the resilience to be able to maintain future adopters so this means we will see them try to FUD it, break it. Do anything possible to make LN look weak.

What people miss is how bitcoin can actually be considered a *green* coin if you look at it in the right light. Imagine  finding a great spot to build a hyrdo dam but the location would not economically make sense to build a dam. Either the populace is so far away or not enough populace to use all that electricity it will produce. To pay back for the dam wouldn't be possible with not many around to actually benefit and pay for it. 
Well what if you used it to start mining bitcoin? Then sell the currency to pay for the dam. Now you have a free dam built that can supply just because it makes money. With that money comes investments in building infrastructure around the dam if they wanted to or use it to bridge more access of the electricity. Or how about a wind farm in the middle of nowhere that would mine bitcoin via sattleite? Those wouldn't exist out there without being able to pay for itself and bitcoin does just that. 
Bitcoin isn't the gold, it's just a ledger. The real gold is now electricity. There is money to make. Bring electricity to places never thought possible. Places to charge next generation batteries to bring to those that see electricity as a luxury. The possibilities are endless.

Lol we still think this is normal money. Remember these cryptos don't print. Fiat, what we use to price and buy it with, inflates indefinitely. The price of most alts haven't changed if anything some went up in value but because the chart is alt/BTC, it will drop because BTC is getting more valuable, not the alt so it looks like the price of alts are falling. Hold onto the good alts because we will be using many of them, all coexisting with bitcoin acting as the reserve for any other alt coin. 
So what I'm trying to say is all these coins are going to do is boom. Fiat inflation guarantees it. The fall of stock markets will start the real boom.

No offense but you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Digibyte (and pretty much most alt coins ) hasn't been put to the test yet. Not even close. Even Ethereum with all its transactions is only handling less than 0.01% of what we can expect in the future. As for saying off-chain is "obviously" less decentralized, just doesn't make sense. You even know what decentralized means? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:06:36
What you should do is sell your alts to BTC when this happens. That way you can buy even more as bitcoin goes up in value. Then when you bought the alts back low on the chart,  they go back up and rise a bit with the new money flowing back in from everyone selling. This is a harder to trade during bitcoin hitting ATH because it could fly up in price right after you buy an alt and everything goes red.

The amount of money you owe is less valuable in the future due to inflation. This is good for borrowers but not really for the lender.
With a deflationary currency, obviously paying back the exact same amount in currency would never work. The loan would simply have to be set at a fixed rate on the value you borrowed. That way you would pay back less and less but the lender wont lose value from inflation since the rate is fixed, even better for lenders. Plus it would make paying back debts actually possible since the currency grows in value over time, causing the amount owed back to decrease without the lender losing any value owed.
Thanks to inflation, the debts we have now will **NEVER** be paid back. Ever. We will only increase it until it completely crushes us. The world has [$247 *trillion*]( in debt. Our global economy isn't even half that. This will ultimately lead to the destruction of fiat currencies eventually (look at Zimbabwe and Venezuela) and what then? We NEED a currency, not assets or we are back to bartering again. Inflation kills the currency. Deflation does not and this is what many deflationary-haters don't even understand. The currency cannot be damaged or people will stop using it. Deflationary currencies make the currency strong and sought for as it should be. Investments will still happen. Nobody has money just to look at it, it is MADE for spending. Sure it probably wont stop economic slowdowns or market crashes but at least the currency itself will always be safe. People need to run to the currency to keep as many people and businesses afloat as much as possible. Wages and prices fall but still, the business don't bankrupt and causing our government to pay off the debt with more debt that hyper inflates the currency to eventually destroy it.
Remember, money is what you make it. It is make-belief. Even bitcoin. However, what currency do you think people will eventually run to? One that decreases in value or the one that goes up? Opting into any money is as simple as just accepting it and for half of the world, digital fiat isn't even an option.

Either you have everyone agree (nodes must be changed with new change in Bitcoin's protocol)  which will be extremely hard to do or do a hard fork to a separate chain that has the new protocol rules. Problem with a hard fork is the con is only used if people want to use it. Not much of a use case if you bought all of your coins and no one buys then on the market.

That's why I say it's the  because it is the one to make you rich. Those guys that did years ago didn't know the future neither. If anything it was probably extremely hard to hold on to it since you were always scared of losing your money so many sold.

Debt only works on paper. Life unfortunately does not work this way. There are always unexpected variables that happen like death, bankruptcy, lay-off of work, too many bills ect. 
From bank loans, that money being loaned is the *people's* money aka Fractional Reserve Banking. When someone can't repay that money, the bank has to borrow more money just so their customers can withdraw money. Now that money is digital however, they don't even need to borrow it, they can just change the numbers digitally and you can print money like that. Digital fiat put fractional reserve banking on overdrive and the banks don't even have to worry about the physical cash much but are creating way more extra money than ever before into the economy by simply changing zeros to whatever. On paper, they would be getting that money back with interest but again that sometimes doesn't happen, even up to billions of dollars borrowed. They lose people's money and just magically print some more by changing the zeros to one.
Now out of all countries that do this (pretty much all of them), US is one of the best at regulating this extra inflation. If you aren't too careful, you can hyper-inflate (print it too fast) the currency and your dollar's value drops immensely low. For example, Venezuela is currently in this predicament and their Bolivars are now a dead currency. They have to use US dollars but it is illegal for citizens to use US money. 
Debt not only can put people in servitude, it can collapse an economy and the currency itself. Debt can really grow an economy quickly but later on it will have to be paid but it's never fully paid because life doesn't work like the paper says. It does not account for "shit happens". All we have done now is keep printing money owed with more credit and this balloon of debt will decimate any economy, even the US. Our over-borrowing will eventually catch up to us very hard, and will put fiat currency on the brink of collapse due to people not trusting their inflated currency anymore. 
Debt is a very dangerous way to create money. It should only be used very carefully but sadly we are at the point of no return. We will never pay that debt back. Never.

1. Fiat is dead as well. 99.9% of fiat is digital now. Any local and credit union banks in the area have a risk with possible data loss aka peoples balances. Bitcoin network is still up and running so for sure funds will remain safe. If you can manage to power two devices that can receive satellite signal, you can access bitcoin's network via satellite and make transactions from it. Still in this situation, there most likely be no commerce anyway of any money, most likely just bartering or free aid.
2. This is the very good argument against bitcoin. It is still like an experiment that is hardly accepted and makes it very volatile. However the hope is that it eventually becomes widely adopted and makes the price much more stable. Adoption is happening however and there are banks,landlords, companies that accept crypto today, just not many as you stated.

Yeah there are a lot of new people with new riches but they had to take the risk with crypto when they bought it first and the believers that held it longer I believe they deserve the bitcoin they hold. Also I believe bitcoin won't be the only crypto we will be using as a medium of exchange. We already have a handful of other cryptos that work great to use as currency but the crypto space is still too new. This is why I tell people to get in as they are still very early. 
Also I say you don't own your homes because you are still paying your homes. If you stop paying let's see how long that home "belongs" to you. I only consider something owned if you are no longer paying for it or else here in America we also "own" our houses haha.

First of all let it be clear there is no such thing as "The Real Bitcoin". A fork is a vote and in decentralization, it's people's right to choose. That being said,  I believe BCH will most likely end badly and I'll explain my reasoning.
Bitcoin has a problem: Scaling. When so many people start doing transactions on the network,  it congests the network like a freeway full of traffic. This lead to transactions being slower and worse, fees up to $100 in some cases (average $25) even if you just wanted to send a dollar. People found a very easy and simple fix,  raise the block size memory above 1mb. This indeed will allow more transactions to go through and it relieved the congestion. It's like building another 6 lanes on the freeway to allow more traffic to pass through. 
This is what Bitcoin Cash did. 
This solution, however, is only temporary and even most BCH users will tell you that it indeed is a temporary solution. Why? Think about that highway that was only two lanes. Completely congested so they add 8 more lanes which even in reality is a God send for us that commute to work. Finally we have cheap transactions again!.. But as we know, more people are born and even with *eight* lanes, the congestion is back. Now we have to add *another* 8 lanes to support more cars...  How? How do you keep adding more lanes when you will eventually run out of room to support all those lanes? This is why it is a temporary solution. BCH increased the block size to 8mb and brought transactions fees back down to normal levels but eventually as more people come on board, that 8mb will soon become the new 1mb and they will have to increase it again. Here's a fantastic [explanation]( as to why raising the block size is a lazy and temporary fix. You can skip to 11:00 and start watching there but I recommend watching it entirely. Also highly recommend watching more talks from Andreas Antonopolous as he will be the best place to get information.
Now why is BCH bad news? It was created because these people did not like Bitcoin's proposition for scaling,  and that is the lightning network. Lightning network is basically an off-chain network to handle payments as low as $0.01 and lower *still*, instantly and virtually for free. It does require you to pay a transaction fee to open a channel into lightning that acts basically like your shopping wallet. That money can now be used to buy things on lightning network (better explanation [here]( Anyway BCH supporters don't like this because they don't like the idea of doing transactions off-chain and consider this NOT Bitcoin anymore. What they fail to realize is that in the very near future, we WILL NOT be able to support the volume of transactions that are coming to the network (explained more in the same video I linked above). We are going to see millions, even billions, of transactions per *second*. Lightning will be able to handle this. This will lead BCH tempted to add lightning. Roger Ver(infamous supporter of BCH, and definitely [cares]( about net worths) has stated himself in a talk they can add lightning to BCH and this flew right over the heads of his supporters. This is the reason they created BCH in the first place!!! To NOT do lightning because, "It's not Bitcoin!" according to them and adding it is INSANELY hypocritical. They will steal features that were added to Bitcoin and people will slowly realize there really was no point for BCH to begin with. 
IMO, it was created to make a lot of money off of new or naive investors that don't fully understand the volume of transactions that are coming. There have also been suspicious activity that looks an awful lot like insider trading from companies like Coinbase and CNBC. There is also something even more malitious activity involving a mining hardware company called Bitmain that sells ASIC hardware to mine bitcoin. Their hardware however had an exploit that would allow them to mine 20% more efficiently than the rest and with it also came a backdoor on *all* of their miners so they could in fact shut down all their miners anywhere in the world if they wanted to. They did not make it public and was discovered by others to bring it into light. Now I'm not 100% sure on this but I believe this was another reason for BCH being born. BTC removed this exploit so they wanted to fork bitcoin into one that simply supported the exploit for their miners. All they had to do now was convince people to use it and it was pretty easy when you could pay less than a dollar in fees like the good old days when the network was far from congested. 
TL; DR: [just watch this](
Edit: grammar and new link.

Yes, bitcoin is in danger of another crypto but we are a couple years to go before people finally know what bitcoin is. How will the market move to another coin if they don't even know of bitcoin yet? You will not believe how many people still haven't even heard of the word bitcoin. We are still too early for that risk to approach yet which is why I'm saying $25,000 will probably have your average Joe looking at bitcoin now. "Seems like everyone is putting their IRA to buy bitcoin," they'll say. By this time when everyon3 joins is when I will believe bitcoin could be in a bubble. I would keeps close eye on competing cryptos a couple years from now. We have yet to see how powerful blockchain really could be.

The  way to trade bitcoin for ANYONE:
Buy when it crashes. NEVER sell. You will never lose and even a kid can do this.
Now if you can swing it good luck. I used to swing it all the time but now I just swing alts which is way more profitable anyway. Reason you don't want to swing bitcoin is because you will eventually be wrong. Bitcoin is very predictable for weeks and then one day it durasticly changes patterns and keeps flying up and you are slowly cashing out only to realise you got out so early. This could fly to $10,000 in a couple more days. If you think that sounds far fetched, you haven't been with bitcoin long enough to really regret to time the tops.

He is way too impatient. More and more conglomerates like Samsung are already working on making asics and this competition will only grow. Hashpower will be split all over the world completely decentralizing mining hash rate. Sure a normal person cant mine but that's okay, just buy/earn the currency. Leave the mining for the big greedy players, that's the point anyway, we just dont want one company like Bitmain to hold so much of the hash rate but again that will soon go away as bitcoin continues to be adopted.
Better to focus on making full-nodes easier and cheaper to run than worry about the mining. The miners will leave bitcoin and that is a scary thing to hear for 99% of the market. Far too risky to even be considered and am deeply surprised he still supports this.

When you take a loan of let's say $10k, you have to pay it back monthly. By the time they get their money back,  that $10k is worth less thanks to inflation increasing prices.

I know this strategy seems insane when you apply it to stocks but bitcoin is different. Bitcoin isn't a bubble,  it's a sponge. Soaking all the inflation from all over the world.

I really don't think most of you understand what decentralization is. It's so rare to find that these days so it's very understandable why. Bitcoin is merely a tool and I never call it a stock. It is an investment as you are actually putting your money where your mouth is. Just like investing, making money is the very reason most people even care about it. 
A global currency is a tyrants dream. Control the money,  you have power. Bitcoin has killed this dream with decentralization. It only has the  spot still because it is the most decentralized (not perfect), trusted, and  tested currency. Do not forget the other 2/3 of the population ready to add to a new global economy. After much consideration, I have figured it would be highly improbable for this to happen since there are so many factors to consider with each and every nation. I am invested in anything looking close to this because for every single person to trust a currency would most likely have 1 or a few to be used. For them to be trusted, it must continue to prove easy access to anyone and decentralized. I can't stress the decentralized feature enough. Bitcoin imo has the best *chance* as a global reserve currency.

Fractional Reserve Banking is the biggest theft ever created and it allowed for the banks to buy out seats in high places. We think loans are a good thing (which they can be) but fail to realise it is a scam to keep us in servitude to a highly unfair economy. They claim inflation is good for reasons like it promotes investing and movement in the economy but it's complete bullshit. It is meant to crank up prices and then by deflation buy out everything from under you and now not only do they buy what they want cheap,  they get rich off it as time passes. It's brilliant and has been copied by every country. Sometimes even to buy countries.
Bitcoin is a slightly deflationary and very new type of currency that is scary to people. They see inflation and it scares them. First on the deflationary aspect, people beleive this to be a problem for the economy (and it just very well might be they way we are set up). Thanks to inflation, it makes sense that you want to invest/spend it to keep or increase it's value and not get eaten by inflation. This puts in your head that it is like fuel for the economy. However,  there is a problem. You now hold assets, not the actual money that you use. What happens if no one is buying the asset you hold? Instantly broke. You would have to sell at an insanely low price or worse, get a *loan* to bail you out. It is proven dozens of times, we eventualy fall behind on the loan, and the economy go bust. With a somewhat deflationary currency, everyone wants to hold the currency. No matter what happens in the markets, countries don't go under since they of course held some of that currency. Prices change accordance to the economy and business are heavily affected by possible losses, but everyone's (including the businesses) money is unnafected since its value most likely just goes up to keep the economy going. Also just because we want to be hoarding our currency will not stop economic growth. Money is used for one thing and that is to be spent. Maybe not today,  maybe not this year,  but it will be spent. Sure it's possible that it will be slower economic growth but at least if things go to shit, we went bankrupt, or just in a gully, I'm sure this in itself will cause bull runs again. In a deflationary economy, when times get bad, it will be just because things need to get cheaper. I know business hates hearing this but hey, at least the currency you hold goes UP in value, your expenses are down, and you get to ride another bull run until the next gully comes along. This is just obviously terrifying to think about as an investor though, we never like hearing I could have bought it cheaper next week. Just gotta remember people literally don't stop coming up with ideas or forget they need more money to keep up their needs/wants. 
Remember if what I'm saying seems far fetched, it should because this has obviously has never been done before; A deflationary global currency. This means that anyone claiming falsehoods of a deflationary economy as a whole is bad, is also far fetched as we have never ever had one before. Gold is a close example and it's a currency that's lasted thousands of years so...  Yeah.

Jesus man just read my comments. Just know that with no electricity, *seeds* would have a much better chance at being a currency. Gold and even bitcoin (let's just say by some miracle bitcoin still works) will still be useless when you have a starving population. After millions starve and things somehow become stable again, then gold should easily become usable as a store of value again. This of course leaves bitcoin as a memory but you really think we will soon be in a post apocalyptic world where electricity would soon be a fairytale, feel free to go long on gold.

Every time bitcoin was having insane buying action (or vice versa), coinbase would crash and you couldn't buy or sell or even check the price. when it came back on, the price would be dramatically different.

this is a scenario everyone reads so wrong. In a world where the internet is down or there's a power out, Bitcoin is dead sure (as long as its permanent. A temporary power out would just pause the bitcoin network) but so is every other currency, including gold. This excuse cannot be used since it kills everything. The only currency that works now is bartering at this point.   If power was to go out permanently, trust me, end of our civilization as we know it. It would take a miracle to hold a country together. Every single day without electricity, people will starve for essentials. How many people have gold to pay with? bitcoin? physical cash? No one will even accept a bag of gold over a bag of food. Currency needs order. It needs rules. It needs easy access. All of this is broken when we cant go to work and earn it. If power was to come back from after a week or whenever, bitcoin continues on the last block as normal. The world is left in a wreck but bitcoin is still working fine with everyone's bitcoin still where they were. Bitcoin wins if this happens. The world would be forced to use it since no one is ever going back to gold coins and heavy coin purses just to go downtown. All the fiat in the world is over 90% digital and so many banks operate privately all having miscalculations and erased balances. Bitcoin wins so much that there will be a point where bitcoin is the norm. mark my words.

No sir it won't be bcash holding it back, it will be consensus. While I agree that complete privacy is important to protect your wealth, transparency for all is a feature as well but can also easily be used against us. Theoretically though,  a government using BTC could prove if they are actually using funds where they said they would, show if they have accepted money from "other" sources, or stealing money. It basically can put those in power in check as well but this cannot happen with a tangible and completely private coin. Trust is removed for it's sake and now have to keep their word. 
Having a trust-less payment system is revolutionary and huge. Having a private coin with the characteristics of physical cash is also huge. Sadly, they are polar opposites. What improves one,  damages the other. Now that we know we can have multiple cryptos, there will be others, like me, will be okay with having both a trust-less currency and a private currency. I know some will disagree with me but really, good luck trying to soft fork bitcoin especially with some monumental changes to the protocol.

Bcash praises p2p and cheap transactions. If this really matters to you, try Nano. 1-5 second *confirmed* transactions, p2p, and *zero* fees forever.
BCH is just put a bandage on the scaling issue. Real life payments and transactions should not take time,  it needs to be more liquid than that. Instant and zero as possible fees. That money has to move quickly for some people and businesses. The transaction fees will add up even if they were set to 1/sat per byte. If BCH gets worldly adopted and goes up to let's say a conservative $1m per BCH, each satoshi is 1 CENT. That is around $6 per transaction. Oven if they managed to cut the transaction size times TEN, it would still be around $0.60 per transaction. It cannot scale on chain for so many reasons but people want on chain transactions so bad because of the security it brings and that's understandable but it just can't work to handle small and micro transactions. You're better off investing in Nano or any other neat crypto than BCH.

Yes but for thousands of years we never supported this many people. Maybe in places with absolutely no water, food,or power will remain unaffected but you really aren't thinking. Your mommy and daddy and your friends all have jobs. All the food and magic water that come to you are all thanks to electricity. The reason we work is all thanks to electricity. Just think how of every person from every town. Do they have years of food supply? You won't be able to go to stores to freely buy food and how will you buy it without a job? Will they even sell/give it to you or feed their own loved ones? How will you even talk to them, no power. No USPS to deliver your letters. No cars would work to take you simply across town anymore. You are trapped and no food is coming, what are you gonna do, just be less comfortable appreantly.

As soon as you change the code juuust a hair to the point one network doesn't recognize the other, you now have forked and both are different. Which one is "real"? If you made them to be decentralized, *the market* decides,  not you or that isn't decentralized at all now is it??? The code with most user/volume is the "real" one. The rest can try to convince you and that's okay. To trick people and put the name of the most popular/used code on top of your garbage copy code is a scam and *will* lead to loss of funds four countless of new and vet users alike. Yes,  we have a right to vote and decide what we think should be bitcoin but it has to be in consensus. That is literally how the fucking network works. Not to mention the very definition of decentralization. Without the majority you are acting as a centralized authority.

Deflationary economy isn't perfect. You can still have a slowdown and people will take a hit to their wage when the currency goes up in value. Loans are simple since you can always have a static value set to pay (shrinking payments) which benefits the loaner for not being affected by inflation and still receiving interest. As the value of bitcoin goes up, everything must go down in value and will cause these crashes as well. However the big difference is the money is safe. Since we hoard the money,  not assets, we will be alright with money still left in our pockets. People will still own the devalued assets but hey you still have money to keep the business going and have to lay off thousands of employees. It won't prevent layoffs however from the losses of assets getting devalued but still is a much better outcome than the entire business going under.

Most people aren't rooting for it, they are warning us from it. This hyperinflated and massive debt came way before bitcoin came along. A financial crisis WILL happen again. We never wanted this because it impacts everything and everyone negatively but still,  we can see the signs and we must warn others that are busy riding a euphoria of credit and huge "wealth" in shares.

Some may not want to admit it but cryptos are *cool*, metals are not (listening to the younger generation). Still, the article does not claim that gold will be worthless but rather lose its spot as global store of value. I don't really have to argue the part how gold is definitely shit when it comes to being a currency so please please please get this dream out of your head. People were convinced to use paper instead of gold. Anyway the store of value side of things is where it can get debatable. For one,  a main argument is Bitcoin's volatility. This however is a false argument to store of value and more for a currency side of things. It's a real problem for business if I get $50 today and it is $25 tomorrow and I needed to pay expenses or whatever. Long term savings however,  bitcoin was a mighty contender as a store of value since it not only was able to maintain your value but durasticly increase it. I mean retire next year kind of increases. Any gold bug will tell you their gold is to hedge against inflation and bear markets and bitcoin has done this way better than gold in its short 9 years of life. This still doesn't not mean that BTC is king though simply because of gold's track record  and this is why bitcoin hasn't just swept gold off its feet. It will take years for people to gain more trust to a network that holds all the money than to something they can actually hold in their hands. 
Just remember; The young always eats the old, and you can't spell gold without the old. My bet is obviously on cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin is an investment. You are investing in an experimental currency and hoping it gets adopted globally. You get amazing gains as it grows in popularity and usage. It is really easy to forget that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are simply tools, tools that only governments and people in power were able to make. Now anyone can make their own tools with its own rules and we decide if we like it. If you accept that there can be a global currency, it would have to be very trustworthy,  easily accessible, and very decentralized. Bitcoin does this very well at a basic level and will be a while before we can even consider another crypto to hold this spot as a global reserve currency.

I think people only feel the transaction is complete once they can access it as they please. While it is confirming, the bitcoin have never left and in this case bitcoin transactions are instant just take time for the network to verify the bitcoin are authentic.

You can buy from someone locally on localbitcoins.com. They accept many forms of payment and you wouldn't need a bank account. Also getting paid bitcoin for services or selling items is another easy way to get bitcoin.

Actually there is a reason you should be angry. At least not you personally but people *will* lose money from this. Why don't we just name all dozen bitcoin forks bitcoin? You won't know what wallet will accept what! This will lead to more regulations all thanks to Rogers desperate attempts trying to confuse new people. I get that we have our right to choose what is bitcoin but as consensus. As you say the market decides and they still decide bcash is BCH. I hope people don't accidentally lose a shit ton because of false labeling.

lol don't listen to *this* guy. Buying on a panic sell is how to make the most profitable and safest trades. True It can still plummet but you have to use support lines and you will have a very profitable (sometimes small but always profitable) trade. Markets are just emotion. Try remembering this every time you trade.

I would say anything you are willing to lose would definitely be a better statement. While LN privacy and security will improve over time, it cannot compete with the security of an on-chain transaction so using (especially *leaving*) large amount on the network will start small and increase as it proves itself more over time.
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:06:02
Buy some and think long term. The price for bitcoin is incredibly cheap compared to what it will be worth in a year. Plus if you have any now and a split does occur,  you will have the same amount of coins you had for each chain (if you bought one BTC before August one,  you will have 1 bitcoin and one bitcoin cash). 
If you do decide to buy, make sure you do some research on how to protect your coins during the possible chain split. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:22:05
ANY money is a commodity and as far as i'm concerned, it is already better than the money we have now.
Sure, bitcoin isn't perfect, yet. And still, even if bitcoin fails, there are tons of other cryptos that are learning from Bitcoins struggle and trying to compete.
In the end, bitcoin's tech will win, not the paper money. We are just waiting for all the people like you to finally accept that you are following a piece of paper printed by the billions for the banks and  feds needs. 
If the day ever comes when the banks lose our money again, China or another powerful country to not accept US worthless paper, Or the people see that money can virtually be anything, then it doesn't matter what or how many bills you have. They will be worth 0. That's all money is; what people are willing to accept as a form of trade. And bitcoin, even at its early stage now, is THE BEST way to trade value in human history (of course now there multiple cryptos that compete with btc now).
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:58:46
As much as I disagree with a hard fork, I highly recommend you guys keep your coins. If there's one thing I learned about investing/trading, is that emotion and ego will lose you money. You have to remember that NO ONE can predict the future. Especially in the crypto world since this is all still very new to us. I too believe BCC will fail but I will still hold on to it for a while in case we were wrong.

This is short term thinking. People have the power you should know this. The future is "the people have decided to use cryptocurrencies!". But which one? Will they use this safe,  decentralized coin with $50 fees or this other safe,  decentralized coin with a 5% (or something that actually seems realistic)  small fee?
