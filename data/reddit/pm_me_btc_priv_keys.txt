I hear a lot that these instruments will "allow them to push the price down", almost as if the price currently can't go down.
It's worth remembering that there are two parties to every transaction: if one is making money from a drop in price, someone is losing money. Try and find that person.

While vanilla Bitcoin may be a value store, there is plenty of opportunity to build additional layers on it to also afford day-to-day transactions.

Let's hope this isn't true - everyone knows the real discounts come *after* Christmas.

For anyone selling at 12k, someone is buying at 12k. Yes, it's zero sum.

Just follow the instructions in my username and have a great day.

This is where the future is. Not improvement by forking, but improvement by building layers on what we have.

Start for the money. Stay for the technology.

I like the idea, and love Bitcoin, but this doesn't seem applicable given a move towards sidechains.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:15:36
It's sad, but I know people that have been buying in very small increments and immediately sending it to their wallet, unaware of the problems awaiting them.

You can't get taxed if you can't sell because you lost your private key on a piece of paper that your wife threw away because she thought it was a receipt from the supermarket.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:01:00
IT'S OVER. PANIC SELL!
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:14:07
Sounds like I might be needed here

It's all zero-sum, these people are the people that help others make money. It's a good thing they get involved.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:39:19
Ugh, it didn't double in value today, what complete junk

Increase the blocksize by a constant all you want - you just delay the onset of the same issues. BCH hasn't been cured, it's just treating the symptoms.
@_date: 2018-08-27 08:38:57
So this is how BCH was made.
@_date: 2019-03-03 19:09:08
Best use for BCH.

The only thing was someone sending me a P2PKH address. Still hanging in there. I'm sure the name will pay off one day. Lambo soon.
@_date: 2019-03-08 18:55:03
Or just PM them to me! I'll be sure to keep them safe.

Obsoleted every 2 years. Great way to sell the idea of crypto.

Man, I've got a lot of Bitcoin, but if this happens, I'll happily see Bitcoin go to zero.
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:15:09
Nah, I just wanted OP to shit himself.

That awkward moment when you realise your .png still has layer information in it :S

Wish I had bought my 2 BTC @ $10,000 instead of buying them at $20,000, now that they're $3,000!

I really disagree with Bitcoin being used as a currency. It might have that as a secondary use, but for me, it is the blockchain with the highest hash rate, and that makes it a prime candidate for non-repudiable communications.
While other blockchains out there attempt to address this at an application-specific level, they're useless without the hash rates that would allow a powerful malicious party to rewrite history. Bitcoin currently solves this to some degree. This is where I believe the future is.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:35:35
He actually said it failed as a currency, but the underlying technology held promise.
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:32:25
I think you just blew it.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:13:43
Which spam attacks are these? Know any papers that detail these? I'd be quite interested to read how the attacks took place.
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:31:25
Your point does not contradict the possibility it could be a bubble.
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:18:34
Leverage on this kind of thing was always the road to ruin lol
