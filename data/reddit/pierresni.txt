Open sourcing the proprietary protocol would address ~10% of the concern. Open sourcing the server-side code would address ~90%.
You want this to be a proprietary and centralized service that you can build a start-up on and monetize. I get that. It's a common mistake that people new to bitcoin make because it works so well in the fiat world.

Right. It's not. "Money" is a objective label for one part of Bitcoin (bitcoins - the ledger entry).


Yes, they are, the former is obviously economics, the latter is obviously computer science. They intersect at Bitcoin.


Ehrm, no, the opposite is clearly the case. Those who confuse the computer science with the economics with the politics are the ones who describe it incorrectly, often to promote a fantasy agenda (generally something like "it's just the technology that matters!" or "Bitcoin will help the poor!")

Wait, you thought "it's fine if you think that there's only one true way of doing business" was addressing my argument point by point?
I will address another point:


I think you're conveniently looking at two extremes because you want to appeal to "average joe". This is a fundamentally flawed strategy, as average joe does not care about personal finance or his privacy. You should instead target bitcoin users who do care about personal finance: traders and small business people. Because of their interest in Bitcoin, these people also tend to be technically savvy enough to *download an application and run it locally on the same secure computer they have their bitcoin wallet on*. That would obviate the need for a proprietary and centralized service hosted by a trusted third party.

Hey Russ.
"money" = economics, obviously.
"money" is not "a metaphor for Bitcoin". It is a description of what bitcoins are.
The distributed consensus theory of the Bitcoin network does belong to the domain of computer science.
Money and distributed consensus are orthogonal subjects, Horowitz's attempt to compare them on to the same axis is either rhetoric in the service of marketing, or just muddled thinking.

Pump and dump only works if there's a dump. There's no dump if the fundamentals are strong. Hence why the bitcoin price ends up higher after every 'bubble'.
Also, there are people trying to manipulate the price up **and** down. Guess what? They cancel each other out. What drives the bitcoin price is adoption waves + ~ emotions ~. You are suffering from this:

From the article:
"A speculative attack that seems isolated to one or a few weak currencies, but causes the purchasing power of bitcoins to go up dramatically, will rapidly turn into a contagion. For example, the Swiss will see the price of bitcoins go up ten fold, and then a hundred fold. At the margin they will buy bitcoins simply because they want to speculate on their value, not due to an inherent problem with the Swiss Franc. The reflexivity here entails that the reduction in demand for Swiss Francs would actually cause higher than expected inflation and thus an inherent problem with the Swiss Franc."

No, I'm only looking at the economic side of maximizing revenue to miners by maintaining a block size limit. From what I understand there doesn't seem to be any problems with scaling on the technical side. As you point out, there are problems on the political and social side, I'm setting those aside to focus on what I know best: economics.


We already have that, it's called substitutes. It's ok if people use substitutes like off-blockchain databases or sidechains.


No, it's actually wildly premature given that average fees haven't started going up yet. We're just now barely reaching the max # of transactions per block.

Yup: 
@_date: 2015-01-22 03:29:55
Excellent summary, only part I would correct is:


I'm talking about acceleration or deceleration of *total tx fee growth rate*. Note that that's a second derivative, because ultimately we're trying to get a feel for the inelasticity of demand (which is largely driven by substitutes as Gavin correctly points out, the reason we can't directly compare Bitcoin and substitutes is because so many of the costs are not an explicit fee, but rather tradeoffs in complex things like centralization vs decentralization).
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:38:16


They don't use the block chain, they use a much less expensive SQL database. That's a sensible substitute for that use case.

@_date: 2015-01-22 03:53:51


Which is it, a tax on all existing Bitcoin holders, or a fee paid by transactors? Can't be both. It's this kind sloppy thinking that leads to poor decision making.


Let's get that process started today. 


No, Gavin's bigger blocks don't take into account the inelasticity of demand for transactions, so they don't maximize revenue going to miners. We should in fact "force the market" to maximize revenue to miners, because a too-low hash rate is an _existential_ risk of ruin to Bitcoin. Remember the key assumption in Satoshi's white paper: "As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers." Keeping the incentives so that they maximize the revenue going to miners is the best way to ensure that. 
To head off all the spurious straw man arguments (hopefully): this maximization function **has an upper bound set by substitutes** (fiat, gold, altcoins). My argument is that there's *a lot* of space between where net total bitcoin transaction costs are today, and where the substitutes' are. Note that this "net total transaction costs" phrase has a very specific meaning that encapsulates all the conceivable benefits and costs of using these currencies (bitcoin, fiat, gold, altcoins) as media of exchange, stores of value, and unites of measurement. That's why the comparison is so complex that we can't just look at one number, transaction fees. Thus unfortunately we have to see where the market begins substituting empirically.

Reposting my comment regarding the economics:
"Limit the number of transactions that can happen on the Bitcoin blockchain, and instead of paying higher fees people will perform their transactions somewhere else."
Only if the (higher Bitcoin transaction fees + other costs) &gt; (transaction fees elsewhere + other costs). So substitutes are an upper bound on demand inelasticity. When that upper bound is reached, that's when there's a plausible economic argument for increasing the block size limit *at the margin to capture the lost revenue* (i.e. from 1MB to 1.5MB let's say).
"you can't maximize the total price paid for something by simply limiting the supply of that something, especially if there are substitute goods available to which people can switch."
Yes, you absolutely can, due to demand inelasticity. Your argument is that if the average fee quadrupled to 0.0004 btc then we would see 75%+ fewer transactions. I don't claim to know what the demand inelasticity for bitcoin transactions it is, but it's obviously not perfect elasticity.
tldr: economically speaking, core dev team should not worry about increasing the block size limit until at the _very least_ we see average transaction fees consistently above the 0.0001 btc 'minimum'. At that point we can revisit this debate. There are other questions about feasibility and politics that I'll leave out.

Ok, I'll address your points. I think that, - this issue aside -, there is still a tremendous amount of uncertainty and risk in Bitcoin. This issue increases it by 0.01% maybe. I think companies being hesitant is 100% healthy and good, the network should continue to slowly grow organically. **At this point in time**, companies _should not_ be making long-term commitments to the Bitcoin economy. We're still extremely early. People are treating Bitcoin like a startup that has to grow exponentially or die. They're freaking out about the price not constantly going up and just grasping for any source of growth. My advice: let's pump the brakes and follow the precautionary principle because the risk of ruin is **enormous**.

Not necessarily the case, with O(1) propagation and unlimited block size, fees will drift down to a satoshi. This will likely not be enough to make up for the block reward and will make the network extremely vulnerable to political attackers (look at how many Keynesians, socialists, and opportunists attacked the gold standard throughout its existence). 
O(1) propagation and unlimited block size are the biggest threat to the long term security of the Bitcoin network.

That's where he's wrong, see here: 
There is **significant** endogenous demand inelasticity for transactions. Substitutes aren't a real problem until you get into the $5+ per transaction fee area. We're at 200x less than that right now. I don't think everyone would shift to Litecoin/gold/dollars if fees drifted up at the margin. Bitcoin is **much** more appealing than just it's $0.02 tx fee. It has other properties that make the transaction fee *insignificant*.
