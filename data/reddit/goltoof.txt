Don't get me wrong, I spend more than my share of time on reddit, but I can't say that it's "essential" to my survival or success.  I've gotten plenty of great ideas, asked lots of questions, had lots of laughs here, but the vast majority of it is "junk".  As useful and entertaining as it is for me, there's very little substance here that can't be found in a book, a library, in the company of friends, or other sites that have much more refined and concentrated data.  Sure, the internet is and always will be an important tool for mankind, but it doesn't control us (unless we allow it to).  Of all the memories I've had over the years, the most memorable and satisfying were spent outdoors, camping, snowboarding, doing stuff that didn't involve a computer screen.  I get that not everyone's profession allows them to step away, and not everyone wants to and it's up to them how they spend their time. Yet some of the most neurotic people I know are addicted to social media.  They think they aren't in control if they're not checking twitter, and at that point it's controlling them.  This is why a lot of highly successful people advocate the importance of meditation, yoga, spending time in nature, etc.  Plenty of billionaires in this world who never touched reddit and spend close to zero time on social media platforms.  To each his own I guess.

Or, you know, just use bitcoin as a currency like it's meant to be instead of sitting around hoping it'll go up again.

Weren't you saying that when it dropped back down to 9k?

At a certain point you might also consider doing something else than spending 2160 days in a row on a social media site, including putting your cash to some other use.  Like a vacation, a plane ticket somewhere away from your computer. You never unplug?

Pseudo-intellectual is what people who think they're better than him but can't articulate arguments well enough to deconstruct his points call him.

I'm so glad I don't listen to you guys.

Why do you insinuate that i'm "judging"?
And what makes you assume i don't have btc's?
Are you good bro?

You could also take that money and put it somewhere more stable, like gold or whatever.
