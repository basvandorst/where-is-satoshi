Naturally, I will give all the information needed from my side. The episode is ignored and no charges pressed if the hacker agrees to return the money.

I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the support.

Add Mundobitcoin CEO Mariano Bolaños and co-founders Tuomas Santakallio and Fred Mazo. (company is launching demo of their exchange and then it being popular, considers opening services in Europe). We can accommodate increased block size. It only asks for more hard drive space, but I think that's not a big issue if the objective is to make Bitcoin mainstream.

Take our portable point of sale terminal, and make it happen. Then you can buy and sell. We are about to ship it around Asia anyway. Why not there?

The hacker can keep a reward. Blockchain.info has my logs. The wallet has only 9 transactions prior to this. The transaction was not laundered through a mixer. I know that it can be identified.

Do you have a Git open about it? Do you take in collaborators? I'm looking for a solution to implement an open source Bitcoin gateway for an individual merchant, which would couple with a wallet that has registered customers. The registration would happen at a Bitcoin exchange. The objective is to create a network of Bitcoin exchanges that can operate formally, yet have an agent network. Sort of Localbitcoins, but formal.

Yeah, the login to my Gmail to recover my Blockchain.info password was made from BT Openzone, Trafalgar Square almost noon using a Windows computer. The attacker had used malware previously to recover my Gmail password.

I have contacted them, and I'm pressuring them to react. They have the log from their own server. That should help a bit.

Yes. Someone had obtained my login credentials, or bruteforced the password. I suspect having my gmail compromised. The credentials have been backed up there in non-obvious parts in non-obvious emails. Otherwise, I've used a clean computer to log in from the website itself and the Blockchain.info mobile app only. I have never used another computer to log in.
