Nope.  Another POW fault.  It is definitely true that using heuristics you can help lower risk with 0 confirms.  Thats true for all transactions.

He makes some interesting points.  Price has to always be relative to something.  You can only be stable in relation to something else. I will say that I am impressed with Bitshares tech.

The stakeholders vote people in.  It requires running a Delegate aka block-signer aka miner for BTC.  Instead of paying mining costs which goes towards power consumption/hardware, the block rewards are directed to Delegates.  Each Delegate campaigns under a platform which includes what % they will be paid. So money from block rewards is put into hiring top of the line nerds instead of the ridiculous mining game.

The difference is that banks do not buy inefficient computers.  Thats what POW is aka Proof of Waste.

Make your voice heard and don't go.  It is ridiculous he is still speaking.

It really appears this article is more misleading than the one he talks about.  I understand Bitcoin people need their koolaid but the article never even mentions how all these millions in AngelShares were actually in BTC.  The people who donated got screwed on the value because of BTC's price fall. If Invictus could have put it in bitUSD with BitShares then their investors would not have been so screwed to begin with. I know this will be downvoted into oblivion but at least it is true.

I agree with everything here.  Better consensus systems just replace POW they don't just swap out the hash algorithm.  I'm not talking about X11 or such things.  If you were able to study POS and had a sufficient technical background, your opinion would likely change.

It would be very difficult. I think finding consensus for such a fundamental change would be near impossible. So you would require a forked network utilizing the same BTC addresses and amounts.  Eventually the new network would grow to have more value than BTC.

It really appears this article is more misleading than the video he talks about. The article never even mentions how all these millions in AngelShares were actually in BTC. The people who donated got screwed on the value because of BTC's price fall. If Invictus could have put it in bitUSD with BitShares then their investors would not have been so screwed to begin with.

Have you not looked up how much power is consumed?  There are better algorithms.  Bitcoin is a cool thing.  When I first heard of it I thought it'd be this cool way to do micropayments etc then you realize the limitations.  Electricity comes at a large environmental cost and the power consumption will always be proportional to the network's value.  Sad.

This is all true if you believe in that POW is required to maintain blockchain security. I used to believe this too, about a year ago.

They've almost made up for the abortion that Windows 8.1 is.

Ugly truth but not a surprise.  Perhaps internet media will help fight this as the barrier to entry dwindles.

I would like to know the details of the contracts that are keeping Paycoin at the conference.  Everyone has to put food on the table. :P

Yep capital control is a form of passive imprisonment.

It is sad that by boycotting we also hurt Factom et al who are legitimate companies.  What is the right solution?  We don't know without knowing the contracts and financials that got Josh Garza his spot.
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:40:42
Correct except it is for superfluous "work" that only has value because POW was designed that way.  Almost all the profits are paid to hardware manufacturers and electricity instead of improving Bitcoin itself.
