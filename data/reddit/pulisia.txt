Bitcoin trading exchanges are not regulated markets (yet) so there's nothing illegal with manipulation. The same thing happens in the unregulated forex market as well.

In other words, they're thinking of setting up their own altcoin. 1 billion supply (first 2 years), with a 1% pre-mine.
Can't wait for stealth launch followed by the inevitable pump and dump :P

Imagine the market pump if ISIS demanded the $200MM ransom in BTC for the 2 Japanese hostages.

Bitcoin.org: We're removing Circle from our list because etc.
The Rabble: Yay, good call, we didn't need them scumbags there anyway
Circle: Actually, we made the request to be removed from the list.
The Rabble: Fuck Circle, Bitcoin.org can list whomever they want! Let's put them back on the list anyway just to spite them.
Bitcoin.org: ???

The BTC bulls are seeing what they want to see right now, hence the euphoric mood and their early celebration. Some people just need to learn not to *overreact* and set themselves up for disappointment.

So whoever's a 1% Super Rich is automatically an asshole and don't deserve their riches, right? 
Funny how the same doesn't apply to those who hold more than 1% of all BTC in existence.

All this bashing won't hurt WU at all, but rather have more potential to backfire and make the Bitcoin crowd look like a bunch of immature kids.

You can also try bringing up your case on their IRC channel  and  on irc.freenode.net

Actually the latest update in the thread is that Cryptsy has already unlocked his accounts and OP confirmed his funds withdrawn.

Judge questions the qualifications of someone whose [google search result]( shows a topless man licking a hammer, how surprising :P

That could explain why Cryptsy "resolved" this issue so quickly

Thank you for succumbing to pressure from people who can't bear to be excluded from private meetings of private businesses.

The shorter the timeframe, the less reliable TA becomes. Also dependent on whether the majority of the players are using TA in the first place.
