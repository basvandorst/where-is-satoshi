Tether and Bitfinex are owned by the same parent company, so Bitfinex could be completely fine, but if Tether goes down and takes the parent company then Bitfinex goes down too. Obviously something like this would be unprecedented, but this is the wild west of technology and finance.

We should be trying to be as inclusive as possible in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:31:30
should have hardforked so people would have to use it. Instead we're making petitions...

Mempool is most definitely not empty... not sure what you're talking about...
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:27:39
yeah its called buy an actual miner.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:23:53
This is why soft forks are shit. Segwit should have been done by hardfork.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:02:12
I'm still worried about the Tether/Bitfinex situation.  There has been multi year bear markets in the past. It could happen again IMO. The spike this year reminds me of the first run to 1200 a few years ago. Over all trend is up yes.

A bit disingenuous.  The Bitcoin XT deal was ridiculous.  Bitcoin was worse off for losing Mike Hearn.  He is an exceptional engineer.

hahaha mEth. I feel you though. Makes you wonder if the DAO hackers are DCG affiliates though because they seem to support Eth Classic (where the stolen coins are) pretty strongly.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:57:32
hook a brotha up w/ a source? Very interested.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:30:45
no one cares what you think
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:36:00
because why else would anyone use or care about Eth Classic
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:30:06
yeah they want to help decentralization, with a machine they can buy off the shelf.  That's a miner. Nodes are only useful for the person running it.

yeah im retarded, just read the title wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:11:59
Dude he developed Google Maps...he's definitely an extremely talented engineer.  He didn't have as many contributions because Core refused to merge them, which was why XT was created. That's where his work went.  At the time I agreed with the position against a benevolent dictator.  But now I'm not so sure.  We need to find a way to keep talent and be more inclusive.  Many new devs are working on Ethereum now and I think that's bad for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:52:32
Gemini is the best exchange by far in my opinion. Much less hassle and excellent support.

Bitcoin Cash has 8mb blocks and a different Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm, so it can still be profitable to mine, while co-existing with BTC.
BTC has Segregated Witness, which fixes the wishy-washy properties of transaction ID, while providing slightly more (~1mb) extra block space by moving the signature data from the block into a child witness block basically.

Say what you want about Roger but he is probably the most anti government person in the world.  
You are out of your mind that he is clouding with some government.  There is 0 evidence to support your claims and much to counter it.
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:24:26
still into it
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:32:03
No reason why it couldn't have been done via hardfork. It would have been cleaner.
@_date: 2018-05-15 11:56:35
if youve been in the game for 4 years and are depressed youre doing Bitcoin completely wrong
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:41:46
why not use Bitcoin instead of Lightning?
@_date: 2018-05-15 22:13:42
At the protocol level but that’s not true for an exchange
@_date: 2018-05-28 01:00:16

hmmm.......change 500+ lines of code for segwit or 10 for unlimited......hmmm?????
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:46:12
If the mempool stays clear unconfirmed transactions are basically as good as confirmed because you can be reasonably assured that the transaction will be included in the next block, which is better than a LN or SW transaction because it's completely on chain.  Unconfirmed tx is fine for a cup of coffee or micro payments.  To me these sort of features are scope creep.  
Regarding Andreas, you can be really smart and be wrong about something.  
I think the less we change the code the better, based on my experience as developer...

this meme doesn't even make sense
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:31:48
You're totally wrong that nodes can't store the whole blockchain into the future. 1Tb hard drive is ~bucks on Amazon. Plenty enough memory for full node. Storage will continue to get cheaper and cheaper as time goes on. No need to bring any transactions off chain...because Bitcoin is quite literally just the blockchain itself.  If the transaction isn't on-chain it's not Bitcoin. Segwit Coin != Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:41:51
20 min still too long IMO

Who are you though?
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:55:59
Eastern Markets don't want Segwit.  Eastern Markets just want a Bitcoin that works.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:46:29
Couldn't be more wrong. I used to be able to send 10 cents to my friends who were new to bitcoin.  That was before the blocks were full.  
Clearly out of touch with reality...

You must be new here...welcome to Bitcoin...if you are worried about being attacked I suggest you focus your attention on tether/bitfinex. We're all gunna be screwed when that goes bad.

It just stinks that the last really pure thing (crypto) has to be corrupted by people
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:41:54
What's concerning to me is where he decided to do the exchange (bitfinex).  Very fishy things going on there with Tethers and their banking situation.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:30:41
yeah that's what Bitcoin is aspiring to be...run by credit card hubs
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:03:00
wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:08:21


To be fair it's not exactly that straight forward.  If Bitfinex creats $20mil in Tether then uses it for margin trading or for wash trading, that $20mil can push the price up hundreds of dollars at a time, which affects the price of all BTC or altcoins affected.  Rinse and repeat for a while and this becomes a problem.  However, if the rumors are true this means Bitfinex is in Mt. Gox territory, which will affect all cryptos not just BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:10:33
What if he just wants to see a Bitcoin that's usable for transactions? I don't see how supporting Bitcoin Cash is a personal attack on you.  Both Coins have went up in value since the fork, so you made money. You're question hinges on the premise that supporting Bitcoin Cash is equivalent to attacking the network, which I don't agree with. Why would he attack the very thing that's blessed him so much?  What if you're just wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:49:15
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:46:31
I mean the underlying tech of the coin isn't changing, but that didn't stop the 2year bear market after gox. Maybe this time it'll be 1 or 6months in this case. Bitfinex is pretty big but they're not 80% big like gox was.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:39:58
keep us posted. As far as I'm aware no one has evidence of any deposits or withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:16:04
Yeah but if they buy 20 million worth in a short period of time, what does that do to the exchange rate? Which affects all Bitcoins.  Not as cut and dry as subtracting the amount issued. Hence, my concern.

so we just gunna act like that guy's not dead and there isn't morbidity on front page of r/bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:46:10
yet look at the mempool
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:48:50
LOL 2%

? I still don't get it? I thought AsicBoost was bad and I thought it didn't work on BTC because of Segwit. What is the technical difference?
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:34:36
this place has become so juvenile 
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:58:07
I mean you're just going to move the funds off anyway... BTC.com has a BCH wallet as well that I think works the same.  I think Jaxx is going to support it too eventually
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:40:29
still sucks at leading twitter
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:56:48
You can download the Bitcoin.com wallet app and make a Legacy Bitcoin wallet and a Bitcoin Cash wallet.  Then use the scan feature to scan the same key into each wallet and sweep it. Then Shapeshift them or use something like Bittrex.com

stupid fucking science project. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:49:49
the 2x part of the Segwit2x compromise failed because core refused to hardfork.  So they hardforked Bitcoin, what is so hard to understand about that. If you owned Bitcoin at the time of the fork then you own both. You win either way, so who cares? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:27:41


there are at least 2 other big implementations as far as I'm aware. Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Unlimited.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:14:29
Core should have sent Adam Back instead. Samson really couldn't get into the technical very well. I actually think this reflects poorly on him.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:28:54
wow get fukn rekt OP
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:00:30
you mean bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:32:29
Yeah he would have been better than Samson prob.  I'm wondering if they sent him because he is familiar with Asian audiences or something.  I say Back because he is a more low level developer than Lopp I'm pretty sure.  As far as I'm aware of Lopp is mainly web/wallet dev. Not necessarily protocol level.
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:44:20

software engineer here and long time (3+year) BTC hodler here. Recently bought Bitcoin Cash to try some of the new applications they have. 
Don't really understand the animosity towards it. I have both so maybe I just don't care, but how I see it is Bitcoin split over scaling debate and how to implement scaling.  Either way I win so who cares?

@_date: 2018-04-04 14:55:01
yeah I was pretty surprised to see Samson actually debating him? I wonder why now?
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:40:22
How do you not view enabling an entire feature (1k ish lines of new code) as safer than changing parameter values in roughly 10 lines of code that are already in production.  From a pure development perspective I just don't see how this could be the case.
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:45:46
lol everyone is removing their coins for the fork
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:24:54
thats more like it
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:19:20
depends on how you define outperform...if you talking technically, there is no reason why bitcoin couldn't be bigger than visa... I don't think you have to make the choice that presented here as settlement vs payment network.  It can realistically be both.
