In the true spirit of r/bitcoin, keeping doubling your bets till you get your money back.

Look for another bag holder. He's actually using it for what it was meant for.

Diversity is good because it gives him a new subreddit to invade and parade himself about as an expert.

Isn't telling people how they should be using bitcoin a form of censorship?

I think you are completely missing the point of a dictatorship. Perhaps if said chief scientist wasn't busy taking vanity shots and grand proclamations that make him look like a pretentious neckbeard prick you might actually get some work done and stop being the butt of ridicule.

Not got laid in a while eh?

You should really stop visiting the DNM OP.

Could be worse, they could have chosen to speculate on bitcoin for a living.

Satoshi is female. That users haven't caught on to that is somewhat amusing.

And enabled thousands of dollars in fraud perpetrated by carders. Congratulations!

Christ, not only do you make a shitty product, you come in with the lamest corporate shilling attempt I've seen in years. If this is how your boardroom presentations go I seriously question the sanity of those who gave you money on your funding round.
At least use the bloody venture capital to hire someone for this. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:09:46
No, there is zero difference. Stop crying over potential drops in value.
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:05:04
LOL. It's business. If you don't have any IP you have no inherent value. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 20:39:26
Had no credibility before and have even less now. Bitcoin has a people problem from top to bottom it seems.

The disconnect here is alarming. This is meant to be a tech company, yet these latest adjustments are in direct conflict with the don't worry we'll make it up in volume tech company principles of profitability.

All that opsec.

Your track record here is on par with your lifestyle choices record.
@_date: 2015-10-25 03:04:52
Holy christ you have never been involved in business have you? Sweeping statements like this are why retailers HATE even entertaining the notion of offering bitcoin payments.

Elaboration: they better consult a fucking lawyer.
