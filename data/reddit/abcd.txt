Unless he was keeping them all for himself and faking the whole thing.

Would you consider mining to be "earning"?

This shall forever be known as the gilded thread.

Did you gold yourself for your Hitler joke?

If you're feeling generous you can make a small donation for my advice...

You're doing the lords work, son.

How much did you end up making, and where did you get them? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:56:20
Why do you think this?

The Republicans and Democrats have basically traded platforms in the past 100 years. Lincoln would be considered liberal by today's standards.

I really need to figure out the BTC community. Some seemingly benign things make some people a lot of money. Are there really that many crazy rich people in here now? Damn.

Yeah me too, my dumb as sold off some to buy low and I'm getting raped again. Oh well. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:09:10
So why aren't you buying a few now and selling at 1500 instead of holding in the 700s?
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:43:13
That's the coolest graph I've ever seen in my life. I wish there were more things like it.
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:01:17
Congrats. Don't tell any friends or family or it will get weird. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:21:38
You really think it'll hit 1500 and drop below 798? I wish I had that kind of crazy. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:30:54
This is a pretty sweet idea

Why does that address have so many coins and so many mini transactions labeled seized silk road coins? 
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:20:38
Makes em feel good to give a little wealth away. A lot of people gained the ability to change someone else's life with little impact on their own comfort.

I don't think he did it in the thread, but I wanted to thank for a tip. Feels good.
