Depends on the fee you paid. If you paid the lowest fee of 1 sat/byte then it can take up to a week, depending on how busy the network is. 
You can check that Twitter account for a very rough guide of what fee to use depending on how urgent the transaction is.

Transaction costs are a bit on a non-issue really since you set your own fees. Delays will only happen if the network is really busy and the fees you've decided on are relatively low.

I'm assuming they're trolling. If not then he's a bit daft.

Every transaction takes up storage. So for every byte of space a transaction will use, you pay a set number of 'sats', and that is the fee. 
For example, 
By transaction fees you will see 9.3 sat/vB. So for every Virtual Byte a fee or 9.3 sats will be paid. Virtual Size is there at 317 vBytes. Leading to a fee 0.00002949 BTC.
So the fee is pretty much what you pay to get priority processing and have your transaction recorded.

I just buy small amounts once per month and either hold onto it or make purchases with it. Spend what you will not miss.

What sort of fees are there with Coinomi? I'm a noob.

Bitcoin is the 'Vaping' of the financial world. Ridiculed. And here I am, involved in both.

Wait what? How?

Welcome. I started 3 days ago. Should be fun.

His first words were literally "I had some problems with my card".

I always wondered this. Once you've hit send, is there something the average person can do to now cancel the unconfirmed transaction? The only thing I've seen is that you can change the fee. Is it possible to cancel a transaction after you've hit send prior to a confirmation?

Yeah he seems to be intentionally idiotic. Entire point of the post was that he had issues with his credit card, and Bitcoin worked well. ��‍♂️

Yep. If you buy BTC with card they take a chunk, and if you withdraw out of Binance it's a 0.0005 BTC fee as well.

As in you sell BTC there? What methods of payment do your accept?

Might depend on location. I live in Barbados and I have no idea what my options here are. Most wallets/exchanges I've tried aren't available here.
