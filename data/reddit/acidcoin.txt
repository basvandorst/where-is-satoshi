Yeah, all that Coinbase support can do nowadays is to blame it's "huge growth" for not responding. I got some BTC dust that I want to transfer to my other address - it bounces back all the fucking time by staying "Pending" for 24hrs... They're not keeping it.
@_date: 2013-06-07 10:39:49
i don't see a point in that. you could tip some more and get upvotes
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:26:38
I thought the "roll" was like rolling a dice (1-6)?
Lots of bitcoin love spreading here, folks
@_date: 2013-04-24 07:53:55
Sorry for your loss. I don't use any wallet on my iPhone, the phone is only for Authy and Google Authenticator, just makes me feel more safe.

If I'd get a 100 BTC just like that, I'd invest 30 BTC in Asicminer shares (13-14 full, proper shares), would keep 20 BTC for buying stuff locally from others - if they'd want cash, I'd try to convince 'em to take BTC and probably tip a few BTC around my close relatives, set them up with their own wallets. The last chunk (~44 BTC) would be split in 2 parts. One in cold storage, other in Bitstamp's wallet for a cash out if I'd need one.
Maybe someone's feeling generous and could make the dream a reality? No..?

sometimes, *good* shit happens, I suppose.
@_date: 2013-05-26 16:00:43
how generous of the choir.
@_date: 2013-04-30 11:51:36
I'd cash out most of them (about 75-80%) and buy me some land. Get a loan from a bank (yeah, I know - whatever) and start building a house on my own. In 10 years (or more) time, the remainder of BTC and LTC stash would probably be worth as much as my bank loan debt and I would pay it off like that. That timeframe won't be enough to get the whole world out of fiat currency and in with crypto, but it's safe to say it's value will rise significantly. Also, if BTC and LTC would fail, I would've just lost a fraction of the stash, not most of it. I want to be a believer, but I'm more of a present kind of guy, not the future.
But that's just me. And here come the downvotes.
On a side note, I was in Oslo (Norway) this weekend, it was awesome. Recommended.

@_date: 2013-05-07 09:44:22

@_date: 2013-11-14 08:14:20
Have you tried avast? It's really good for a free AV.
@_date: 2013-05-23 10:00:26
my thoughts exactly
@_date: 2013-06-07 06:11:25
so, basically you bought the upvotes
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:53:14
like that's gonna happen. the billionaire has left the building.
@_date: 2013-05-21 11:28:14
Hey, thanks man :)
I could teach you a lot more :D
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:14:21
yeah.. Coinbase sells 1btc for 58,20$ at the moment, you got lucky.
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:29:25
you poor soul, sitting on 10k $ :/
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:24:07
What about Bitstamp?
@_date: 2013-05-24 07:25:37
Nice. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-24 07:30:46
Keep calm and stay silent. And hoard those coins. You know, what if [this]( guy comes to your house..?
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:13:39
my thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:29:17
that are some wild tips. a little like my user name if you know what I mean.
honestly, just want to get tipped.
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:34:18
sad. at least I didn't know anything about it until 2011, even back then didn't take it for granted. well, at least I can imagine myself wealthy
@_date: 2013-11-15 12:18:40
Would love to give my sister one, too bad I ain't got any to give :/
@_date: 2013-05-28 07:30:23
Deflation is better for holders. But holders can easily turn into hoarders and if everyone hoards, economy's fucked, there's no movement of money (be it $ or BTC or whatever).
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:10:09
I could smile if it'd rain on me
@_date: 2013-05-20 06:14:27
ouch.. well I translated one word in and didn't get anything in return.
@_date: 2013-04-25 07:28:06
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:32:43
even this tip will look insanely huge. Give it time.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:19:04
could someone tip a reddit newcomer?
@_date: 2013-06-06 07:28:42
would someone buy me a beer? at least tea would be nice..
@_date: 2013-05-23 07:30:50
could I try some of that TRC too?
@_date: 2013-05-28 10:31:49
yeah, all I got in BTC is small units..
@_date: 2013-04-19 08:04:04
Yeah, that's why I tend to talk very little about bitcoins AFK. Even on Twitter, I get no reactions about BTC from my followers.. Forever alone? :)
