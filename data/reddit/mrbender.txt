Have you considered Mt.Gox E-Commerce API with IPN? Instant transaction and so on...  They will also launch a Magento and they DO NOT CHARGE fees!

If they use Mt.Gox Business API it will be instant, as long as their customer has a Mt.Gox account of course

Sooner or later, Intersango will face the same problems that Face MtGox when in regards of the law. Just accept it. And I personally would rather put my money in a Company that follow the law like Mt.Gox than a company that does not. Less Chance to see them having to close their business over pressure from officials all around the world.

I had the same problem until someone explained me how to read it.

Nope, I was running an e-Commerce business shipping up to 500 parcels a month, and PayPal NEVER EVER cover the merchant. PayPal will ALWAYS be on the buyer, Visa, Amex, Mastercard Side. We had several cases where we had the signature of the buyer on the delivery note, his confirmation by email and PayPal still accepted his claim 6 month after he purchased the product (Around 600€ lost for us). 
So want to screw the system? Use PayPal you will always win and merchants will always loose :(
