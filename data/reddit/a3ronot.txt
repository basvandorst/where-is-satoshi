Am I the only one here that sees the disconnect here?  Using Bitcoin as a speculative investment to get rich in the future is not the point.  If you're an idealist, you're not supposed to exchange it back to fiat in the future.  You're just hoping you hit the lottery.  That's it.

I wouldn't call Bitcoin "financial security" in its current state lol

Most investments don't go from 5-10 grand to paying for college and a nice car in 15 years.  Don't kid yourself.

Thanks for the reply, this is mainly what I was after.  Follow up question...if they somehow obtain your private keys...can they scan for transactions using those private keys and block them somehow? Or would they merely be alerted to the transaction?

This is just a hypothetical question...let's say that I wanted to use bitcoin to make purchases, but for whatever reason, the federal government didn't want me (personally) to be able to.  With normal money, they would just freeze my assets.  Is this possible with bitcoin?  Is there any way that a government could freeze my bitcoin or prevent me from using my bitcoin to purchase goods?

I literally just said that I don't use it as a wallet.  IMO, its fine to trust them with small amounts of money (read: not seriously investing in btc).  For some dude who just wants to mess around with a couple hundred bucks worth of btc, Coinbase and the like are perfectly fine.  Now if you have several thousand dollars worth, then yes, move to a hardware or desktop wallet.

some wallets like exodus have shapeshift built in

I'd also like to know if shapeshifting is a good option.  Although, I've noticed ETH and LTC rising/falling pretty much in step with BTC recently...maybe not as volatile tho.

I'm at work right now and every time I look away for 5 min to do something, I look back and it's jumped another 1000 lmao.  what in the world is going on? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:09:48
I agree, and I don't. But it can still be a wallet. Especially for low amounts of money.

seems to be holding at 18k but some exchanges seem to be down so who knows
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:58:49
It is.  Problem is...its so volatile you might have trouble doing that consistently.

I'm saying that most financially sound investments rarely make more than 7-10% long term.  Theres no way a "normal" investment makes enough in 15 years to pay for college and a nice car.  You're hoping your investment triples which is not normal.  Start reading more into things.
