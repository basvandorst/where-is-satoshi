Just log in to gdax with your Coinbase credentials then do a deposit of BTC from Coinbase to gdax, then a withdrawal from gdax to an external address (your nano s).
It's very straight forward.

But don't rule out malice

Great question.  Bitaddress uses a JavaScript library that you can download. It is essentially open source so you know that what you're running is not compromised.  You can save the web page and run it while disconnected from the internet.

I posted this over in just recently, hopefully you can find it useful:
THIS IS HOW FOR A WINDOWS MACHINE
1) Go to bitcoinaddress.org and save the page to a .htm file on the root of your hard drive (c:\)
2) Download and install the Linux live usb creator (
3) Download the tails ISO (
4) Use the Linux live usb creator to burn the tails ISO to a usb drive
6) If you're using a hard wire internet/network connection physically disconnect (unplug) it and reboot with the usb drive connected
7) Connect a printer directly to your computer with a usb cable. If the printer is Wi-Fi capable, explicitly disable the Wi-Fi on the printer first
8) Boot the computer into Tails Linux and open your Windows C drive and open the saved .htm file in Iceweasel (the tails browser)
DO NOT CONNECT TO WIFI OR PLUG THE NETWORK CABLE IN WHILE BOOTED IN LINUX
9) Generate and print the wallets your need and while offline. When you're done just reboot without your usb drive.  Everything you just did will be erased.  If you don't have a printer you can generate wallets and write the public and private keys by hand, just double check that you write it correctly, taking note of the upper lowercase letters.
If I can answer any specific questions that are unclear I will.  A helpful tip: since it's somewhat time-consuming to do this it's nice to generate a bunch of wallets and print them at once, then you have them handy when you want to put coin them instead of generating a new wallet every time.

The problem is security.
If you're using a compiled program to generate your wallets you have no way of knowing if your generated private key is secure or if the author or a third party is copying your keys.

While booted in Tails print to a file and use TrueCrypt to encrypt the wallets and store them somewhere.
Also when you print the wallets, you could print several copies. If you use BIP38 you don't need to worry do much about someone finding or stealing one because it's worthless without your passcode.
