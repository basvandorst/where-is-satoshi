Does Edward make a a false comparison under the assumption that both would be equally bad or illegal? Filesharing means just that sharing of files. Possible illegal acts would have to be proven, in Dotcoms case the Hollywood-PR monkeys had direct access to delete al gusto 24/7. The case would see Dotcom as a free man if procedure would actuallly follow LAW.

it's about cost of supply. silver is probably the best award/risk ratio of the 4 biggest (gold, silver, paladium, platinum)


it's not not valued, it is valued - for nation states a new person means state can take more credit and pay more interest to private banks, so banks always want population growth. there is a reason why china gave up 1-child policy the same time chinese Renminbi was finally accepted into SDR. And China is now most indebted, second only to Japan - and that after 3 decades of annual double digit growth. total fuck up.
so in summary you are a born debt slaves the second you take your first breath and you're supposed to provide labor in means of tax all your life, till you die and even then your heritage can be taxed. lol

historically the value ratio of gold to silver has been 1:5 
and if you look at total available current supply it's 165,000 tons for gold and 777,000 for silver so it's still roughly 1:5, however price ratio is off by up to 1000-2000%
the biggest fundamental difference in ownership distribution is that banks and nations have gold reserves, but silver is only held by people.
in production the difference would be that silver to a significant amount is a side product of copper &amp; zinc mining.

Privacy is a basic constitutional right and encryption is it's tactical defense.
Without encryption the war against the British suppressor may not have succeeded.


What offended the colonists when the soldiers came legally knocking was the violation of their natural right to privacy, their right to be left alone. We all have the need and right to be left alone. We all know that we function more fully as human beings when no authority figure monitors us or compels us to ask for a permission slip. This right comes from within us, not from the government.

You make me laugh


that's a good point, and i'm wondering about that. Why would that be? (Is it harder to fake gold coins than silver?) and how much would lower supply quantity influence price?
If any king or state or Newton sets up a ratio of gold to silver for payment, there is the incentive to go out and ship which is actually worth LESS and cash in the arbitrage and eventually the ratio has to come down to supply. If Newton sets up 1:15.5 and there is less silver in supply/ mining/ production of course one would ship in gold in exchange for silver. So after the 15th century Europe had access to cheap silver from Mexico, Peru &amp; Bolivia, and they used that source to crush the silver money in China.
Look what I found


Naturally and in AVERAGE the ratio would be 17.5:1 (which we only know NOW). So maybe it's like this: gold is rarer and that's why it will be held for value and of course if it's rarer, it's more valuable and people will invest more risk, capital, labor, time to digg it than silver - and maybe that's how we get to this 1:5 total supply and maybe also China as the most developed economy before let's say 16th had this 1:5 evaluation. For the specific geography and time it seems relevant how much outside trade the economy does, the more the higher the silver ratio. 


Menes (1st Egyptian Dynasty, 3100 BC) gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 2½ 
Croesus Mermnadae (561-546 BC) official gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 13 1/3 
Augustus (Early Imperial Rome) gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 12.50 
Charlemagne (AD 781) gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 12.00 
Edward III (14th Century England gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 11.57 
Jean le Bon (14th Century France) gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 11.11 
Spain 1500 massive silver supplies from the Western Hemisphere jump above ratio 1 to 13.0 
China 1400 to 1600 gold/silver price ratio of **1 to 5** rising to 1 to 8 
Spain 1687 gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 15.0 
Isaac Newton (Royal Mint, 1717) gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 15.21 
Napoléon Bonaparte (1803) gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 15.5 
France's bimetallic system 1848 to1873 French legal ratio of 1 to 15.5 
US Coinage Act of 1873 gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 16.00 
US 1876 gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 18 
US 1886 gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 20 
US 1900 gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 33 
US 1910 gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 38 
1930s Roosevelt forced China off the silver standard. Removing all that monetary demand for silver made it lose value against gold, industrial demand could not soak up the excess supply 
US 1941 for the first time in history, the ratio hit 1 to 100. 
US 1980 gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 16.00 
Late 2003 gold/silver price ratio of 1 to  75 
Mid 2004 gold/silver price ratio of 1 to 50 to 1 to 70 
January 2006 gold/silver price ratio is about 1 to 60 
June 2007 gold/silver price ratio is about 1 to 49
Now do you have an explanation why the current ratio of annual global production of gold to silver is 1:9
2,860 tons (2014) for gold vs 26,000 tons (2013) for silver?
If natural ratio is 1:17.5 and current price ratio is 1:77 why is the mining ratio in countries with actual standards for environmental protection and labor laws 1:4 for Australia and 1:5 for the USA?

china is pretending to stop capital flight. but only of non-members of the red barons families who work for jpm &amp; goldmanS anyways. the target are the ones that actually create wealth: the productive middle class. they should not afford to hedge their capital abroad - they are only allowed to flush their yuans down domestic realestate &amp; stockmarket toilets and watch the bubbles pop. hitting unionpay is just natural step for the govt, after kicking alipay &amp; wechat payments, harsh western union controls etc...
now with bitcoin it's the following: the last thing the govt wants is to buy worthless USD &amp; bonds (which they reduced in august big time). Sure they dont like bitcoin helping capital flight, but on the other hand trade is controlled by china like 80/90% and production is also in Chinese hands, all at the mercy of the PBOC. So that is giving china control over the digital gold. If they ban it well they dont stop capital flight as the streets will offer trades with a premium mark up. 
So it's profiting and controlling the future gold OR ban it losing the leadership and create incentive for illegal dealings and new creative ways of capital flights.

i did some research recently and somehow that rough 1:5 stuck with me, maybe it was more about China than the West...
looking at these wikipedia sources i see the numbers you quoted. but i have my doubts because the ratio should vary anyways, if i see something like Roman Empire 1:12.5 i remember that Roman Empire lasted centuries (technically even 1.5 millenia) and supply and price (and purity) was varying over times so it should be a range anyways. A 1:12 ratio is very common and probably arbitrary to fit in the duodecimal system to create multiples of 12.
earliest ratio i see is 3000 BC at 1:2.5 in Egypt.
most numbers for medieval Europe  in Europe 1: 12 with Newton peaking to 15.5
Northern Africa/ Middle East 1: 6-8
edit: now i remember how i got to the 1:5 from these charts with total supply of gold and silver

Historically bananas have never been money, they are now commodity.
So in a survival scenario it would seem logical that you are already close to the banana trees as there is no transport and no refrigeration, bananas will go bad quickly (don't try this at home!).
So they can't function as store of value as they a) naturally devalue too quick b) possible trading partners are surrounded by trees as well and therefor bananas are not scarce
Properties of money
I just mention the bananas because Antonopolous is treated like a pope, but makes the most ridiculous statements on history of money. He's often so wrong, but also often "not even wrong". With these statements he's therefor undermining credibility of his statements about bitcoin.
BTW dry tealeaves functioned as money in parts of Asia (China, Tibet, Mongolia, Russia/Siberia) until 19th century.

@_date: 2015-12-16 16:57:33
but it's so stupid because it's wrong on many many levels. first of all bananas as food are a rather recent product on a global scale. It wasn't used as food before in most parts of the world, because before refrigeration it's hard to store, and it would only be around were there are banana trees anyways so the value is low to 0. So even in those areas it was only used as commodity not as money.
It's so bizarrely idiotic and non-factual. and on the other hand counter examples are plenty as i mentioned below for example tea in east asia being traded from west china to himalayas and to siberia. i'm not a public speaker, nor full time certified historian or banker but i know this much and he's just blabbering bs where there is NO NEED. there are so many good reasons why fiat is garbage, there are so many reasons in favor of bitcoin and there are so many reasons in favor of other money in the past - it's pathetic. if i ever get the chance to visits a talk of his i'm gonna throw a banana just to level.

if 0.1% of gold holdings move into bitcoin marketcap would double (+400$)
if 1% of silver holding move into BTC marketcap would go up 50% 
Converting gold and silver bugs to bitcoin is a good approach and it's sensible for bitcoiners to stash physical silver and gold. 
P.S. Bitcoiners don't throw away your old computers and smart phones/ tablets. Once Gold tripples and Silver goes 5x this electronic trash will turn into mines (about 0.03 g gold and 1g silver per device)

What db wrote this? Uber can't compete in non-monopoly markets, it's driven by cheap credit from wallstreet and army of lawyers that achieve a temporary relative advantage over the traditional local taxi industry which is having higher cost due to taxation and regulation. however it's just a matter of time before closed source competitors enter the scene large scale and much bigger danger open source decentralized alternatives which is the end of uber, as uber's overhead cost is higher and the centralized structure leads to costly restictions and regulations making uber the victim of its own attack vector.
Uber lost 2.5 B last year and tries to gain marketshare by aggressively undercutting others even if it means losing 50% of revenue as subsidy - you see the desperation when the company considers a city in West China it's biggest growth market.
Considering current cash reserves Uber expansion will come to a halt this year, max 2017 and then implode to a few selective markets, after that it will have to redefine a new niche (like combining passenger transport and express delivery). 
On a second note, there have been trillion dollar companies in the past and present (Saudi Aramco for example), probably author meant publicly traded.

Venezuela was once TOP4 GDP/ capita, still has the biggest oil reserves, is not overpopulated, has rich nature, long coast - depending on import of food, toilet paper and even freaking petrol is beyond stupid. seriously bitcoiners lets throw our coins together and take over, oh forgot power is also cheap af thanks to the rivers and power station, so mining costs would be lower than china could ever dream of.

Fundamentally all the FED does is printing more money, every once in a while it is adjusting printing speed. Fed is also market maker for interest rates and sets minimum capital requirements for banks. Of course now we're nearing negative interest territory, money printing is at warp speed and capital requirements are 0 (because banks can fill capital req with junk) - besides all orders come from the central bank of central banks - the Bank for International Settlements in Basel.
But the most important function is psychological: the good daddy in the cloud that is overseeing all economic activity and helps the whole society and thus everyone in it. And no matter what situation, no matter the difficulty the FED will be there for you just like the Central planing committee of the Politburo in the Soviet past. That's the message.

I used to think all that's needed is a critical mass to find out about FEDamentalism and it will be challenged, however FED is part of a huge wealth distribution scheme from productive to rich and productive to lazy - with social welfare, free healthcare, food stamps, lower interest rates for student loans etc the elite has an army of loyal foot soliders (about 70% of the population) to jump into defense whenever the mass media tell them to and hunt for the productive forces which are most milked by the system (about 10% of population). Another 20% of the population (the self sustainers) is scared and will act opportunist as their net exchange with the system (taxes vs pay outs) is about 0 - so they can't win only lose if they dare to challenge the system and they may be even worse apologists for the current system as they to lose on step on the ladder which the 70% unproductive don't.
Conclusively the 10% net productive can't win in their geography, so once the financial crisis gets wild and is accompanied by economic, political &amp; social collapse - they will have enough incentives to regroup among themselves or with the better part the 20% self sustaining - that will be outside NATO, EU, NIRP, TTIP, ACTA, BRICS territory. Look up 1929 for further instructions or be detroited.

i think these kinds of movement will increase in the future, and new crypto community islands are just matter of months now.
However i dont think that building some kind of hippie community within fascist frameworks has any future that extends beyond the first mover generation and look at the "counterculture" from the 70s what's left of their freedom ideals? bottom line is they pay tax one way or another and submit to the power, how they rationalize is secondary really.
One had to be far away from the violent powers and an island can create that distance through geography. The next problem is critical mass and diversity/ mix, because it's pointless to live with 100 basement programmers, you need a balance of old and young, male, female (keep the peace and satisfy sexual needs) and different skill sets to ensure as much autonomy as possible, that would also mean running for example a hospital, or an airport - but also more trivial matter: you also want to try different kinds of foods at least once in a while or visit cultural events (kumbayahing with a out of tune guitar next to campire is not enough fun to repeat it regularly).
I think we got all the tools and just need a good plan, the upcoming financial and economical collapse could function as a trigger, however that extra thrust may come a bit too late.

Venezuela is sitting on a humongous mountain of asset: nature with diverse landscape, long coastline, mountains, rivers -  tons of minerals, biggest global oil reserves (and also lot of gas). so they have enough CHEAP energy either fossil: oil/ gas or renewable like hydro powered. enough arable land for diverse agriculture and no overpopulation. 
now the reason venezuala is such an awful economy is foreign interest which is either installing supercorrupt regimes or weakens the governments it doesn't like (or keeps a superweak and incompetent socialist president in power).
so the upside potential i see is massive once Venezuela somehow manages to diversify the economy and stops the dependence of oil exports as the single lifeline - it would take some sort of coup by armed forced (ideally the people owning the guns). i wouldn't be surprised to see a special economic free trade zone in the country being established to reboot the economic system.

if you scroll down 
you can see a graph with monthly payments listed and Euro amounts, most months stay below 200 tx and 4000 Euro - if you divide that by the 100 participating shops it's like 20 tx per shop per YEAR and 500 EURO which is at best in the 0.1-0.2% league, less for most.  i think some places get 10x of the volume and 90% of the places probably close to nothing. but i think it's about reaching criticial mass and since the barrier of entry is so low and people start to really hate banks in the worst case it's free advertisement for places.
