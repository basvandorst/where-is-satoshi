Well, if Bitcoin was 1200$ and you bought 100$, you would have 0.083 BTC. At 573$, your bitcoin would be worth 47.9$, so you would have lost about half of your investment if you sold.
For instance, if you bought in 2010 when 1 bitcoin was 1$, you would have 100 bitcoins, and then at 573$, it would be worth 57 300$.
The idea is to buy now at 573$, and hope that in 5 years it's worth, say, 5 000$ or more. Or at least that's what many people buying bitcoin hope for. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 13:23:01
Yes, in two dates it will be released

Fork on the way I suppose, then
@_date: 2016-08-31 19:59:19
While you're right, increased adoption will require a lot of volatility.
We won't have one without the other.
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:36:16
Let's just pull an Ethereum and Hard Fork the hack!
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:31:01
Its a joke
@_date: 2016-08-30 06:49:00
Your calculation is that you have 100 bitcoins, not that you have 100$ into bitcoin.
Just look how much bitcoin you have if you buy 100$ of it (let's say 0.15 for instance), then multiply this amount of bitcoin by the price you imagine bitcoin to be (ex: 0.15 bitcoin * 773.69$ = 116.05$)

I should sell all my Bitcorn and go down the Roger Ver hole, it seems wonderful
@_date: 2016-08-31 20:45:47
Unless the adoption is over the course of a hundred years or more, I don't see how low volatility is possible
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:44:13


Thank you for that convincing argument

@_date: 2018-01-02 15:29:32
Thanks for your input,
To me the properties of Bitcoin right now makes it better than gold and that's why I bought in 2014 and held until now, the rest (EDIT: segwit, LN, Rootstock etc) is theory and cherry on the top but I don't need them to keep considering we are undervalued, 
My target price since the beginning is the same (especially now now that I made my Investment back - Thanks Bcash!): 
Until we reach 50K I go down with the ship (EDIT: you should have seen the judgmental faces on my friends and families when I was telling that price 3 years ago haha), if we reach it I sell 20% and hold the rest until 100K then 20% then 200K then 20% etc,
I would not recommend my strategy to anyone, but I set my targets and so far it has been a good decision!
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:55:06
I've seen your kind come and go over the last 4 years, it's amazing that you could use a 5k pullback as a proof of the end of bitcoin after its volatile history. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:54:18
Go check the 'organic node count growth' of Bcash, says enough, don't even need to go further although we could

Do you have backups for your claim that non speculative adoption has been shrinking for years?
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:04:47
Your link is some truth on futures and some speculation on level of investment from banks and such.
That's it?
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:53:45
So what happens when Bitcoin gets Rootstock, which can do Eth smart contracts?
You need to understand that at the game of 'if everyone gets the same updates and can do the same thing', then Bitcoin wins.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:56:11
I told friends and family when we reached above 15K that it would most certainly crash between now and 25k, and we could see below 10k again.
They asked me why I didnt sell like half then.
I answered that's because you never know with Bitcoin, and I'd rather lose 100% than miss on xxx or xxxx%.
It has done me good since 2014.
Please don't follow my method though, past does not guarantees future
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:44:33
Exactly. That was the 'Welp, no choice now' moment.

Sorry, so many shills nowadays make people like me jumpy!
In theory any layer 2 in competition with lightning could overtake it in terms of usage, success, etc.

If Satoshi was here his influence would be too great too.
Your arguments are wrong since Vitalik was a 'code is law' guy up until he was too financially involved in the DAO to not promote a rollback and his influence is too great.

Except if we have a pokeball type reversal with a pikachu tail rape below
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:37:29
change your logic and comparison with gold, check gold marketcap, and maybe consider that we could be actually very undervalued still!
Add in a few qualities of currency that will get better and better with upgrades such as LN, and maybe you can understand why, if not you, at least some people believe in it
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:54:55

@_date: 2018-01-11 15:50:35
1) Who cares. On-chain transactions are impossible anyway. See: Hal Finney.
2) Market cap is an extremely dumb way of evaluating adoption levels. I'll fork a BitcoinClassicGoldCash++ and buy 1 to my brother at 500€ for 1 BTCCGC++, I'll let you calculate the valuation of that coin.
Does that mean it suddently shows how widely adopted it is?

I can create my own fork and it will work better than both.
You forget a parameter: level of usage. Any coin can function better than BTC, let's see if they can with the same level of usage.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:58:02
For someone who complained that he couldn't get his 10$ out of clogged bitcoin, I think 33k usd being available is plenty enough.

As soon as people understand this we can move on to ''keep your butthole tight until we have some layer 2 solutions''.
Block increase solves nothing, even short term. Spam will just increase accordingly (not even more expensive since they do more spam but each one is cheaper).
If it takes 2 years to have a solution then so be it, and if Bitcoin stays at 5k for two years IDGAF, I was there for the 1200 -&gt; 200 over two and a half years.
Fundamentals are still rock solid. Fuck the get rich quickers, you can jump ship,  I'll see you on my yacht in 5 years.
Preemptive Edit: any altcoin moving over Bitcoin will face the same issues so I'm not worried about another coin gaining momentum either.

Also, it's not about the money you fucking give to a fucking stranger for fucking free, it's about making them realize the power of the technology bitcoin is based on.

You can't. To hope double spend you would need more than 50% of the master nodes (there are currently 1100) to hope for a 4% chance of attack success. The 10 are randomly chosen.
If they get DDosd then no 20 seconds transaction, just the regular process. But that shouldn't be an issue for long since the MN IP addresses are going to be hidden soon.
Not exactly the same, but we already see these issues if someone has 51% of the hashing power on bitcoin or any other PoW coin.
The code is open source, so I invite you to check it if you have the ability, otherwise head over to  to ask any question!

I like to think that there are 2 ways of investing in Bitcoin: 
Either you understand the tech, love it, and want to get committed in the bit coin environment
Or you can buy a couple thousand bucks of it, cold storage it, and go on with your life until one day in a couple years you hear either "Bitcoin flaw found: price collapses" or "Bitcoin price rise another *10".

why 3%?
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:21:00
You're right I guess.
Still, if there must be a hierarchy between alt coins, Dark is better than for instance Litecoin, since it brings more and requires way less money to sustain the price (the more hash rate, the less coins produced each block iirc).
Nothing to challenge bit coin though, I agree on that.
I may be subjective, but I made a pretty good ROI on dark so far
Still; btc over dark any day

Except worst case scenario, pretty soon if mainstream happens, bitcoin can be used for both: 
- Some invest in it and hoard it
- Others pay via Bitcoin, with instant cash-in on one end and instant cash-out on the other.
The latter won't mind if it's $1 or $1million for each bitcoin, while the hoarder will.

My thought exactly. I'm 24 and spent 80% of my holdings into bitcoin because I'm lucky enough to be in a position where losing it all would just push me back a year, while if it succeeds I might be set for quite some time
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:31:45
I arrived in all this at 830$ each, invested half of my small students savings, and I'm not worried for the least. If I lose it all, it will hurt me for, at most, a couple months. If I win, it's showtime. The risk/reward in this situation is perfectly fine by me, Im even happy that this all happens that soon, so I can test my nerves.
@_date: 2014-10-18 14:48:36

I like to think most of them bought thousands back in the days and sold them, either at a loss, of for a "meager" *2 or *4 their buying price (still an amazing investment, but could be frustrating in insight, if you could have been a millionaire).

I know you're right, but I still have slight hopes, for several reasons:
I got my diploma from one of the top 50 Business Schools worldwide, which could help.
I'm French and got a 980/990 on TOEIC, so I can speak two languages (and even some German, but not on the same level).
And finally, I just submitted an article about Bitcoin to Le Figaro, a mainstream French journal. If it does get accepted (unlikely but, you never know!), I'll have at least done a little something in the Bitcoin world that could make the difference.
Time will tell! I know the chances are low, but they will need people on the business side, so maybe!

The future of drug cartels: moving huge sums of money between borders and "subsidiaries", plus suppliers, etc. in bitcoin.
Then a new kind of fraud appears: "regular" and "clean" people are paid a premium to cash out bitcoins and give back 90% of the sum in Dollars / Euros / Pesos to the dealer.
The same way they now employ clean families (or clean looking cars and people) to cross borders with cars full of dope, they'll use people to "Dollarize" their bitcoins.

No, you would need to possess the 10 that will be randomly selected, because if a single one disagrees with the consensus, then there will be no "instant" transaction.
Those MN would lose all trust after one instance of breaking the rules too (although they shouldn't even be able to in the first place since it communicates with the rest of the network first, unless the guy attempting it possess an enormous amount of Masternode, which would require to drive the price a hundredfold to acquire).
Of course the 10 communicate with the rest of the network first.
No idea about Ripple, apologies.
Anyway, these 20 seconds transactions are just cherry on the cake. The real selling point is the anonymity provided by masternodes, reviewed by Kristof Atlas, and dark coin started being accepted on its first 2 dark net markets (nucleus and diabolus iirc).

@_date: 2017-03-22 16:10:06
to be very simplistic, you'll have: 
- new altcoin BU
- new altcoin Core (no more original bitcoin because had to change PoW because attacked by BU)
- no more bitcoin
Then you'll decide which one is the less wortestest version.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:42:14
Nobody was running a bridge node to relay blocks from pre-segwit miners to the rest of the network. Segwit-enabled nodes will only try to download blocks from other segwit-enabled peers, since pre-segwit nodes won't have the full block to download in the first place.
This isn't a problem for mainnet for a number of reasons. Even in the worst-case scenario, it only takes one person running an anonymous "bridge" node to carry the blocks from pre-segwit to the main network. But before that, miners need to have a segwit-aware "gateway" node to secure their pre-segwit mining node anyway, and submitting their non-segwit blocks to that gateway node (as any sane miner would do anyway) will just work. Furthermore, miners are all using centralised backbones for block relay, not the p2p network - this too will just work.
Since the network literally forks into two groups, it is essentially a hard-fork. 
No. Chain splits and hardforks are two different things. Both softforks and hardforks can cause chain splits in certain conditions (although it's a lot more likely with a hardfork).

I think it's not how he sees it:
As long as it's without 2nd layer solutions, you always have, as one of the big miners (or as a big player), the opportunity to increase the fullness of each block by spamming (no matter the block size), thus controlling the narrative and the cost of transaction.
As soon as you allow 2nd layer solutions, this kind of control disappears.

BU is a version of bitcoin that some people want to push, for different reasons.
But one of their arguments is that we need to raise the block size to be able to treat more transactions in each block.
However, in the meantime, they do not include as many transactions in the blocks they mine as they could if they wanted.
So, they push for bigger blocks to process more transactions while they refuse to include transactions. You see the hypocrisy?

You actually have some blocks found less than a minute after the previous, and other found after an hour only, the goal of the algorithm is that the average remains 10 minutes.
They simply decide which transaction they include and which they don't. The Bitcoin protocol is such that you don't need to justify yourself when you find a block: you include everything or nothing or in-between. 
However, if you don't use all the space and then complain about lack of space, then this is a bit.. astounding. To say the least.

Empirically it has worked.  
It does help "lower the pain" of a downturn, but at the cost of "paying back" that easement during an economic upturn.  
Which means that you need:

2) humans playing ball and "wasting" some of the upturn paying back that QE, which is not always the case

I was a lurker a year ago on Counterparty forum,
Can you please remind me: I can hold both Bitcoins and XCP in the same bitcoin address
And if one day I send the bitcoins to a new address, the XCP will still be in the current address, correct?
If I want to send the XCP to a new address, I'll need to do.. ?
Thanks in advance,

Here are two comments from yesterday that I found quite insightful:
"What amazes me is the fine balance of supply and demand.
Have a look on  and wait 10minutes. Note down how many BTC was bought, now compare that to the 25BTC that was made in that same time. Consider the implications of a 12.5BTC per 10minute difference in supply. It's on the order of 1 to 2% per block.
I'd be amazed if price does not moon.
"Ignoring speculation, we can predict that the price would increase atleast 1.00% at block 420000, then in the next 10 minutes people would need 0.99BTC instead of 1.00BTC to have the same amount of value. So the effect of reduced supply has a 1% reduced effect on price. It's almost a compound interest effect but in reverse. And I'm making the assumption of constant value purchased. 
So by block 420100 the effect should be reduced from 1% to 0.01%, but cumulatively we'd have seen a 50% rise in price over 100 blocks (17 hours) just to satisfy the same supply/demand balance.
after 10 minutes up 1% price rise
 after 20 minutes up another 0.99% (cumulative 1.99%)
 after 30 minutes up another 0.98% (cumulative 2.97%)
 and so on..
 after 17hours up another 0.01% (cumulative 50.5%)

Alright mate, I've thought about it, and it would be even stronger:
Let's say you are right and actually less coins are bought every 10 min. Instead of 1%, those 12,5 BTC would then represent, let's say, 5%.
Imagine the impact it would have if it is 5% instead of 1%..!!

Two ways to interpret this:
- We are still very, very early into Bitcoin, much earlier than we tend to think - months here feel like years recently, with so many things happening (when I discovered Bitcoin in 2013, our big news expectations were whether Expedia or Dell would accept Bitcoin payments, that's it)
- We are the only fools falling for crypto stuff and it will all fall down soon

@_date: 2017-01-25 16:21:45
IIRC, it's:
You come with like 1 bitcoin.
You "give it to the website" as proof and backup.
You can borrow x times that amount (like, you can place 4 or 5 bitcoins).
If you short and it goes down, you earn 4 or 5 times more than if you did so with your 1 bitcoin.
If you long and it goes up, same.
If it goes the opposite way you bet, your loss will be 4 or 5 times more, but if it reaches 1 bitcoin (what you gave initially), it will automatically stop everything, and keep your bitcoin: you lost it.

If you put 100$ at x10, you can play with 1 000$
However, everytime the price goes down by 1$, it goes down by 10$ for you. So, if price goes down 100$ after you start, you're out and you lost your 100$.

Just a question: if I have my 12 words, and someone steals my tremor, I can use them somewhere else to recover,
How do you add the secret additional passphrase? You just add it after the 12 words in what you are using to recover your bitcoins?
Sorry if I'm not clear
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:50:23
thanks, what software to import it with the 25th passphrase?
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:59:46
Second layers make it so Bitcoin can in theory integrate any property of a superior coin, no?
We are talking software, so there is no infrastructure or inertia blocking like it could a company / office imho
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:14:01
in theory, because of 21 million hard limit and inflation of fiat, it can't stop going up at least to adjust for it.

No one quit working during previous halvings and scarcity increased 6months afterwards
@_date: 2017-04-27 09:24:41
Would be no big deal at all.
a month of sluggish bitcoin and that's it.
A wild price ride four a couple months but no one cares.
Worst case scenario, we hard fork to adjust the difficulty but we definitiely wouldn't need to.
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:20:09
@_date: 2017-04-20 10:09:08


It's been mathematically proven that they earn much more with asicboost on current price than fair play on 5 * price increase.

@_date: 2017-04-07 08:59:34
Good summary, thanks!
I see ABSOLUTELY NO rational reason for anyone to refuse to fix covert use.
Then they can overt use if they want.
They lose in any of the possibilities, if they refuse, if they accept the fix and don't overt, if they accept the fix and then overt.
Only good option for them right now is.. you guessed it.. Stalling.
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:48:19
I'd say 2 years because of halving accelerating the process, then agree with you

Come on now, stop taking advantage of my poor english, you know perfectly well what I mean.
You cannot have current money on deflation, because you can't go below 1 cent.
Bitcoin can go much further since it is digital. One of the things that allowed for a 21million finite bitcoin choice and not an inflationary one

Divisibility may allow to avoid part of deflationary currency's issues.
And that allows for a non inflationary Bitcoin. And that could drive adoption.
If I was in Venezuela with some spare money right now, I would have 3 goals:
Find food
Get the fuck out of the country
Save my savings from the hyperinflation 
In that order

Maybe a layer 2 could use only 1 tps on Bitcoin's blockchain while processing millions or billions on itself.
@_date: 2016-09-28 13:14:01
AFAIK, yes. But a change could allow us to make bitcoin more divisible without changing the supply. It is, after all, digital.

@_date: 2017-09-20 14:19:57
At $4K/BTC, you would buy the ENTIRETY of created bitcoins in a year with 2.6 billion dollars.
So, assuming the price remains stable for a year, that's what is going into Bitcoin.
You want to add, over the year, $1.5B to that (about + 60%).
If you think that would have no upward pressure, you should check Trading 101 in your nearest University.

Money talks. If there is an economic incentive to mine bitcoin, no matter the energy consumption, it will be mined.
Even more, it will push for energy consumption improvements to gain competititive edge on the other miners, thus improve technology, then capillarity effect.
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:46:26
I've been here a long time so I don't care about the price, but I must admit I just love the huge variances.
I know it is bad and in the end only stability can mean true success, but for now it's really a guilty pleasure of mine to see it go completely crazy in both ways

They are not. That man was saving huge amounts of money and could completely have afforded to put 600$ in a risky bitcoin bet (and consider they could lose it all). 
He could have gone safe investing with the rest. If he lost those 600, Nothing would change for him. if bitcoin went higher, then that's a bonus.

I was a student and bought at 850$ and saw it go down to 250$ over a few years.
THere's no hindsight: I took part of my savings and took a risky bet with it and kept the rest of my money.
For those few years I considered I lost that money and it didn't change my life.
Now it's giving me a lot of money but it didn"t matter: the risk was rational.
And it would have been for that guy too.
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:47:53

Let's say Bitcoin in the best case scenario is mainstream in 10 years and Evolved nicely, and now 1 transaction is 10 kWh vs Visa's 0.01 kWh
So what? You'll tell people that, and people will tell you that Bitcoin does much more than Visa. You are comparing Apples to Oranges. A bitcoin transaction is so much more than a Visa transaction, there no comparison possible.
EDIT: even if it's still 100 kWh vs 0.01 kWh, it doesn't matter.

@_date: 2016-10-05 15:37:32
I just mean that for this halving and maybe the next one also, depending on the price of bitcoin, the daily creation is still high enough to require a certain amount of money poured into bitcoin just to absorb it.
We're still talking millions daily to absorb it. If price doubles in the next halving, then it's still millions daily just to absorb it.

Who creates the cards? Does he makes money?
@_date: 2016-10-06 06:40:35
You know what I meant. For the price to remain the same, you have to absorb the inflation of bitcoin creation with fresh money.

I think you have no idea what you're talking about:
Here are comments from that I found quite insightful:
"What amazes me is the fine balance of supply and demand.
Have a look on  and wait 10minutes. Note down how many BTC was bought, now compare that to the 25BTC that was made in that same time. Consider the implications of a 12.5BTC per 10minute difference in supply. It's on the order of 1 to 2% per block.
I'd be amazed if price does not moon. "
"Ignoring speculation, we can predict that the price would increase atleast 1.00% at block 420000, then in the next 10 minutes people would need 0.99BTC instead of 1.00BTC to have the same amount of value. So the effect of reduced supply has a 1% reduced effect on price. It's almost a compound interest effect but in reverse. And I'm making the assumption of constant value purchased.
So by block 420100 the effect should be reduced from 1% to 0.01%, but cumulatively we'd have seen a 50% rise in price over 100 blocks (17 hours) just to satisfy the same supply/demand balance.
after 10 minutes up 1% price rise after 20 minutes up another 0.99% (cumulative 1.99%) after 30 minutes up another 0.98% (cumulative 2.97%) and so on.. after 17hours up another 0.01% (cumulative 50.5%) "
"If the amount of value purchased stays the same, yes. It must.
I did a recursive simulation quickly to see where price would be at different time scales.

**TL:DR:** 1% is huge. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:26:20
French 30%. Law last month.
@_date: 2016-07-02 13:14:43
1% less pressure every day is huge
@_date: 2016-07-18 16:05:41
lmao rekt
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:07:58
This is, of course, ceteris paribus.




@_date: 2016-07-08 20:08:51
no because it was worth 50 times less than now?
@_date: 2016-07-30 20:58:52
If I'm not mistaken, you can send your ethereum from one chain to another in a certain way, allowing you to obtain some "for free" in the process
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:41:47
You think they'll talk about bitcoin in it?
@_date: 2016-07-16 08:10:50
Still, monet press = big inflation = high chances of capital flight
@_date: 2016-07-25 09:57:30
That's big news, no?
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:06:55
AND that the real volume is really that high - and I don't think it is 
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:38:18
From a few cents for a 100 BTC to $600+ each in less than a decade.
I agree, it's not shooting up, bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2016-07-09 08:30:45
Personally, I know that you can prove by signing a message since years, but I have no idea how to actually do it haha
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:28:55
you forget everyone having bcash got free sv coins.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:09:01
what?  
No, having BTC gave you BCH, BCH gave you BSV
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:10:32
And some luck, let's not lie.
@_date: 2016-07-25 05:57:24
If I sell only a part of what I bought but just make back as much as I invested, but keep the rest, no taxes?
@_date: 2016-07-13 13:07:31
We must have the same crystal ball! Also Bitcoin and Kim Dotcom will have sex or something like that. Trust me.
@_date: 2016-07-05 06:04:10
Yes, especially the part witg Adam Wright killing the creator to try and impersonate him.
@_date: 2016-07-27 12:56:52
That's the geekiest rekt I've ever seen about something related to millions of dollars
@_date: 2016-07-07 06:27:35
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:21:22
So you think no bubble for the next halving and only for the one after that? That would be a first.
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:35:24
Yeah he is because he can still go because he's not broke on unthoughtfull decisions
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:23:06
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:31:31
@_date: 2017-06-09 05:27:04
Think of the guy that was like you when.the price was exactly 10 times lower.
I bought some at 850, I bought some at 300. I didn't really care since I believed in the tech. Still havn't sold. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 11:32:01
It means Hold, started as a mistake on a rambling post, stayed.
HODL THE DOOR
@_date: 2016-07-07 17:33:29
Good news! - 50 $ for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-07-13 07:56:39
Wouldn't it still be way less than what is used to just store, say, 10% of gold?
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:45:27
it's more like 
2030 Ferrari
2050 Palace
And that's still awesome
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:44:35
when i had just enough left to get a loan to buy my house 
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:47:35
Why longs means bulls scared?
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:44:39
Wait really?  
You can go BTC -&gt; BCHSV directly?
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:21:36
No, they discussed plans but rule of the law is 30% in France for now
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:06:32
It's a scam
@_date: 2016-07-28 16:23:22
Yep :)
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:03:50
I think so too, but that would still block an agressive miner's majority from pulling a hard fork with full power
@_date: 2018-12-21 10:44:00
5 B \* 50 = 250 billion dollar
No moon
@_date: 2016-07-25 17:14:18
It's huge to draw in big investment money that can't buy bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:21:59
It's a diversion maybe
But for what?
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:05:43
74 Trillion Dollars in 2015.
10% is 7.4 Trillions.
For 21 000 000 Bitcoins, this would require a price of **at least** 350k Dollars a Bitcoin.
I don't agree with them, but I wouldn't complain, that's for sure.
@_date: 2016-07-01 10:02:36
Then some company will do the same with bitcoin, maybe
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:56:07
Gratz for holding long then!
@_date: 2016-07-24 18:05:29
That's extremely specific!
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:57:11
A few hundreds is not even the core of your holdings?
Congrats man :)  
@_date: 2016-07-24 10:50:36


lmao, talk about hyperbole.
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:29:56
A full square is 100 billion, so 10 times now?
I can't retire with ten times now
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:53:53
the cat ate 70 cents
the opportunity cost of that cat eating that paper is now 2600 dollars
@_date: 2016-07-05 13:15:04
Especially with renewable energy becoming mainstream as years go by
