PSA: Do the exact opposite of what this "genius" suggested. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:53:42
So, you are admitting this is being done on purpose?
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:40:10
You are being downvoted because you are a fucking tool.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:42:36
You are a professional troll.

This place is turning into the YouTube comments section.  
He heard about bitcoin a couple weeks ago and now he's here to help you.
Buy bitcoins now LOL."

What the fuck does that even mean?  Go back to school, kid.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:51:00
Sure.  You're here asking for help and you have that kind of money.
You don't know how to use Google or Reddit search and are asking random people in this sub for help...?  Fuck off.
Your entire post is "ish."

You are a professional moron.

You trolls aren't going to bury this.  I'll keep reposting this every 4 hours.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:49:33
No shit.  I trust the code.  Now we have questionable devs whose code we are supposed to trust with this 2x bullshit.
There is no particular group, you asshat.  It is a global effort and peer reviewed effort.
You are never going to push your bullshit 2x copy paste.  
I am going to dump all my 2X coins the hour it goes live.

"How do y'all do taxes on this?"
Speak with you accountant about your "$500" (maybe?) in gains and Capital Gains tax.

I've reviewed your history.
You are not a bright person.
Edit: or you have an agenda.
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:26:49
Yes, Coinbase's business model would be screwed by 2x.
The KYC/AML is required (aka tracking) and they need to comply.
Have you used Facebook?  How do you think they make money?  YOU are making them money.
Personally, I've never used Facebook.

Dude. Stop posting copies of other articles on a site you just registered for clicks.
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:46:50
Ethereum will be soon be replaced by layers built on top of Bitcoin.
A person is better off going to Vegas and gambling than buying into an ICO that people like Paris Hilton are promoting.  Those should be stopped immediately.
Edit:  aww-someone who hasn't been paying attention downvoted me.  cute.

Thanks for the tip, genius.  I monitor a global company.
You have no idea what the hell you're talking about in this instance.

The concept of religion was created thousands of years ago to control people and empower people who were in power.  It's still working...
I also do not believe either Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny are real...

At this point, anything Garzik or Ver are involved with should be ignored.
They are both trash.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:14:38
Jesus fucking christ (lowercase on purpose).  Yet another new person who just learned about bitcoin giving advice.
Fuck off.  You know nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:51:44
You are my hero.  I love you to death man.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:44:26
Roger Ver is little more than the equivalent of a used car salesman.  I wish he would go away.

Satoshi told Garzik no years ago when he wanted to be a cowboy:  
People do not change.

Peter R. Rizun - Bitcoin Unlimited, Chief Scientist...
This guy needs to be kicked in the balls.  Another self-serving narcissistic douchebag.
Chief scientist of what?  Copying the work of others.  Fuck off.

No shit?  =P
However, people stand to get "interest" if they treat it as a saving account.  Not too long ago people gained interest by keeping money in saving accounts.

Ethereum is fucked and a large number of people are going to lose a great deal in the not too distant future, IMHO.
Vitalik will soon see everything crumble before him.
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:29:12
Dude, Garzik was trying to do things that weren't required at the time without clearly thinking things through.
That is the same as now. 
My point wasn't about blocksize.  My point was that Satoshi told him to chill the fuck out years ago.
People don't change.
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:53:59
Buy somewhere else with the same convenience then.  
They also need to eat and pay bills.  Coinbase beats wiring money to Europe and crossing your fingers like people used to a few years ago.
I'd wager I've spent maybe 200-250 USD on fees (maybe even 300) with Coinbase since 2013.  Do you think that 200-250 (or even 300) means anything to me at this point?
Stop parroting shit you read.
Edit:  If their "fees" are breaking your bank, you should most likely not be involved with bitcoin.

1st time I've been asked by Reddit for an email address to create an account.  I was NOT on VPN at the time.
I disagree with your analysis.  I do use unique emails, etc.  Something else is going on here.  I created an account on Reddit and ONLY posted to with the account associated with said email address and got spammed with bitcoin phishing emails.
If the end result of creating an account on Reddit when emails are required is spam, what's the point of requiring an email to create an account?  Anyone can create a bullshit email address to create an account on Reddit.
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:26:20
This is all hilarious to me.  A bunch of clueless douchebags trying to compete with some of the brightest people on the planet who are largely involved with bitcoin/Bitcoin to bring positive change.
