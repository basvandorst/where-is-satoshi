The Mona Lisa has value because it is beautiful and unique.  Using your argument, paying only for what you deem to be the simplest breakdown in materials, my computer is a hunk of plastic worth as much as a $2 paperweight.  You're not paying for the materials, you're paying for the artistic arrangement of them.  You're paying for the amount of work that one of the greatest artists of all time put into arranging the materials in just a way as to make them beautiful and unique.
A trip to Paris?  Well there's much more to that.  I'm assuming that I have a reason for going.  Perhaps family or friends?  But even if I do go for only the sights and the experience, as is what you're driving at, there are services I have to pay for to get there.  Once I am in Paris, well, being there is free.  But I'll probably need a plane.  That plane needs fuel and to pay the pilots and stewardesses.  That's going to cost money.
The experience is free.  Getting there to experience it is not, and that's where your analogy falls apart.
But again, comparing bitcoin to the Mona Lisa and Paris is laughable.

This means that you get more bitcoins for less $$$ by buying them instead.
@_date: 2011-06-07 16:01:37
Amazon has far more to lose than to gain by accepting bitcoins.  It's not going to happen. 
Besides that, Amazon has nothing to do with the goals or ideals of the bitcoin project.  I can promise you that to pay in bitcoin, amazon would require you to have an account set up with them, completely removing the anonymity, for one.  Secondly, they don't need to accept bitcoin because they already accept every other nationally backed currency.  This techie, less than a millionth of a percent of their customer demanded currency is the last thing on their mind.

Exactly.  Perceived value.  There is *NO* intrinsic value.  That makes a BIG difference.  That's 200 million dollars in value based ENTIRELY on a mob mentality.

Unfortunately, if Amazon accepted them, the value of bitcoin would PLUMMET, not soar.  The value is so high right now because they'er a scare resource.  They're scarce because they're being hoarded by speculators who just want to see the value go up and up and up until they want to sell.  If Amazon accepted them, people might actually spend them.  This is GREAT for the ideals of the project but absolutely terrible for the speculators...because then the bitcoins many are hording are going to be released back into the "pool" and they won't be as scarce anymore.  Value will plummet.
But not to worry!  Amazon is well aware of how economics works and that's why they'll never (at least not for many, many years) accept bitcoin as payment.

Can I just say first, honestly, thank you for being civil in your argument and not a rabid fanboy?  Your comment was refuting me but it was HONEST TO GOD REFRESHING to read.
I understand quite well the way mining works.  But the rewards for performing those transaction confirmations are not payment in the traditional sense of imparting existing value onto an individual, but rather are the creation of implied value then imposed onto an individual.  I think the project itself is really interesting to watch.  Honestly, I support it as much as I can barring any significant financial investment, meaning I won't be buying a new card to mine with nor will I be buying any bitcoins.  My only purpose here was to try to get people to logically analyze this and heed the old saying "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is."
But I can't.  I failed in my goal.  I have never seen such rabid fanboyism...so many people unwilling to entertain even for a second that bitcoin might not be infallible. 
@_date: 2011-06-12 05:23:13

Bitcoin isn't a service.  How the hell is it a service?  Here, I thought it was supposed to be a currency.  I guess I've been all wrong about it.
@_date: 2011-06-06 19:31:02
I wouldn't say I don't WANT them to, but I know that they won't.  The currency is far too volatile right now and it would be a really, really dumb idea for a company who handles that much business to accept such a volatile currency.
@_date: 2011-06-09 16:01:22
Yes.  I can.  I can obtain much more than that with ZERO investment specifically towards the project myself.
My PC, for example, is always on anyway because I run a few different servers on it.  So I put my GPU to work on mining bitcoins when I am not using the machine, which is rarely.  I see no difference whatsoever in my electricity bill (after all, my PC is always on anyway) and I make, at current prices, over $100 USD per month for no real additional investment on my part.  Does it use more electricity?  Probably.  But for my one GPU, it's completely unnoticeable on my bill...it's not changed at all.
@_date: 2011-06-06 19:22:36
It would be a really, REALLY stupid business move for Amazon to take bitcoins as payment right now.  They're much too unstable/volatile.
EDIT:  If you disagree, please explain why?
@_date: 2011-05-11 14:42:52
Okay I'll try this.  I just lost connection to my home PC... the internet may have gone out (I'm at work) but when it's back up I will connect to it.
@_date: 2011-06-09 16:10:25
Right.  As long as people want them.  You are absolutely right.  My point is that if something changes, if the mob mentality shifts, the price will plummet.
For example, elsewhere here someone made the point that the pot market cap is ridiculously high in BTC right now.  I fully believe it.  However, that's only due to the currency's anonymity.  If pot or other drugs were to become legalized, a VERY large percentage of people would have no need for BTC anymore.  It's value will drop because the protection BTC offers won't be needed.
Let's be honest about bitcoin for a moment...from a geeks perspective it's a really cool concept.  But it's not being used primarily for the purpose the geeks intended.  Most of the bitcoin actually beign spent is beign spent on things that are currently illegal.  MOST, not all by any stretch.
I'm not calling it a "drug currency" as many politicians would, but you have to be honest and realize that's a majority of the bitcoin market right now.
When/if those markets change in the "real world" it will have a devastating impact on the value of BTC.  And if somehow the value of BTC drops, there is NO WAY for people to recover from it.  It will be avoided like the plague.  Sell sell sell!!!!
So many people hoard it right now trying to profit.  Most BTC, I would estimate well over 50-60%, are NOT in any kind of circulation.  When those people decide it's time to sell...the market WILL crash.

In guiminer, what happens when you click "open client as server" under solo options?
@_date: 2011-06-09 15:17:05
200 million is HUGE for something that APPEARED OUT OF THIN AIR.  Unlike other currencies, there is nothing backing it.  I'm not talking about the gold standard or shit like that.  There are no guarantees.  There's not even a GDP of ANYTHING to fall back on and say "hey, yeah, this is kind of worth something."
It's only worth is in speculation.  Honestly....no one has a problem with invisible coins rising 600% in value over a month?  Really?  People still want to buy them?
As a kid I was instilled with a very basic truth: "if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is."
Get out now.
If you're just passively mining or whatever (like I am) that's one thing.  I have made no significant investments other than an ever so slightly higher electricity bill. 
But to the people buying all the coins they can pretending it's an investment that will make them rich or something....they're in for a VERY rude awakening.  Even bitcoinwatch.com is telling people that the price is about to plummet, yet in this very thread I have people offering to buy all of my bitcoins?  SURE!  Take them all!  But don't come crying to me when you've paid me today double what they'll be worth in a week.

"Anarchists" would be really pissed when they can't pull out of their driveway anymore because no one maintains the roads, don't have electricity because government doesn't assure or provide incentives to companies to repair quickly after a disaster, have no water because no municipality organized the construction of pipelines to their area, etc.

Why are you failing to see that for all intents and purposes, the supposed $30 bitcoin that I get for a COMPLETELY NEGLIGIBLE SUM is pretty much the same thing as free?
Ugh.  Forget it.  Obviously bitcoin is completely infallible and will change the world and will be worth billions and EVERYONE will make lots and lots of money and win win win!!!  NOTHING could ever go wrong.  I'm sick of arguing with fanboys.  All I wanted to do was caution people but now I am getting called an idiot and a liar.  Fuck it.  I'm done.

At the time it was only a few hundred, and so it hurt.  But as the price increased I've just tried really hard not to think about it.  :(  It was over $800/coin at one time.
@_date: 2011-05-13 20:32:36
This is problematic.  VERY problematic.  There are not enough vendors accepting Bitcoins as payment...they're worthless other than as an investment tool.  That's the DEFINITION of a bubble.  I will mine, but I won't buy them and I suggest no one else make any significant monetary investments, either.  
@_date: 2011-06-09 15:09:18
You're welcome to but I'll only take paypal.  I'm not worried about people passively mining.  I'm worried about people like you, who are investing massive amounts of capital in something that will almost assuredly lose people thousands of real dollars.
@_date: 2015-10-23 13:52:48
To be fair, I did eventually change my tune.  Part of that was because more vendors actually started accepting BitCoin besides places like Silk Road.  My biggest mistake was wiping the HDD in my pc back then...I had I think 400 coins at the time from mining early?  Lost them all.
I made like $1400 before DogeCoin died, though...so that's kinda redeeming.  Right?  Right!?
Sometimes I cry when I think about those lonely coins.
