Your not getting my point. It doesn't matter if they have found an exploit or this is just variance. The point is only 192 transactions were confirmed in over an hour, this seriously inhibits bitcoins efficiency and viability as a means for transferring money

However you put it they have found a way that not only let's them mine blocks at an incredible rate, but it also decreases the efficiency of the network
Incentivising miners doesn't seem to cover this. This seems allot more like a technical issue
Edit: I know i don't understand the bitcoin protocol as much as I should. But when we can only confirm just over 2 transactions a minute I honestly don't care what sort of problem we have, it's a serious one.

"the CEO has stated that he has lost Bitcoins on MtGox and is seeking new investors" - source?

Well, this is going to be in the news tomorrow.

Whether or not they own 20 percent of the hashing isn't the big issue, the big issue is transactions arn't getting confirmed
@_date: 2014-04-06 16:39:32
They have mined nearly 20 blocks today alone, and transactions are taking an extremely long time to confirm. This sounds very serious

They only call it panic selling when the market makes a rebound, otherwise, it's smart trading
Good luck guessing which one is which! I'd say we're due another dump in the next twelve hours but I might be wrong
