Yes, calling is a good idea. I just went to a location today (found out about libertyX from here) and while the HQ for the company does have a qpay terminal, the location on the LibertyX website was for one of the sub-stores that doesn't have a Qpay terminal- I called and informed support (also because it was my first go and I didn't know what to do) and I presume they'll update the appropriate address on the site (they requested I send an email, which I did when I got home). I subsequently went to another nearby location and the girl there claimed her login for qpay wasn't working and shrugged, rolled her eyes when I asked if there was a way she could get that resolved, and was otherwise quite rude, so I suspect she was just being lazy, but I just left, as it was getting late and traffic had annoyed me enough so i wasn't feeling like bothering with it.
I have intentions to try another location later, there is one closer to my house that definitely has a qpay terminal and a login for it (I called ahead). 
I like the idea of LibertyX because all other methods to obtain took a long time or just seemed a little iffy (meeting people seemed awkward, and I live in Las Vegas and found information about a bitcoin ATM but it was not without a few reports of conflict/controversy in relation to how quickly it shows and issues with proving deposits, based on the very brief time I took to find it). 
Originally I had a friend who was an early adopter of bitcoin who I was going to buy from, but it turns out he sold all his bitcoin a few months ago in order to pay off a debt, after finding out his wife ran up a credit card he was unaware of and neglected to pay for it. It seemed like a touchy subject so I dropped it, but he was the only person I knew personally who had any knowledge of btc.
