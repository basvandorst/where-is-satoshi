Not my ads, but the ones from CoinMarketCap.

I agree that the prices don't reflect the true intrinsic value of that coin, but the truth is we have no any other tool better than money to measure that.

Also feel free to check my account across many social networks:

There is already an unofficial iOS version for CoinMarketCap

Haha take my apologies for that, but those ads come from the official CoinMarketCap and I don't have any control over it. I cannot install an adblocker inside the app.

I thank you! And indeed, Electronjs was used. Great tool!

Thank you Remci for your comment! The simple fact that you can pin the site in the dock is huge for me and the peers I've been talking to, but of course I do understand it may not be something completely different for others.
But that's why I have other cooler features on the roadmap. I just wanted to check if there's demand for the app. 
Will keep you updated!

The code is open sourced and you can actually check out the scripts which build the app 
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:20:08
This is exactly the reason I developed the app haha! So glad to know it brings value.
