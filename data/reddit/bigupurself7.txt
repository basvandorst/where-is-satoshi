A legit company does not have to state they are reliable in the first paragraph. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:10:44
Were we supposed to stop buying ?
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:56:41
Lol 
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:34:17
Ive heard it many times and I agree with the statement : the Bitcoin killer app will happen when people don't know they are using Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:14:11
Do explain. Do you trust this app ? Looks very promising. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:02:59
How many shares of aapl did you sell ? Why wait for after the conference ?
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:02:50
So how much did you buy ?
@_date: 2015-06-08 13:53:25
United way is more of a scam than the red Cross but not as bad as susan G.
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:14:54
Just google united way scam and there are plenty of info out there. When I worked at best buy managers were forcing people to donate. I feel like someone must be getting a kick back for this. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:38:38
Coinbase. Trust me. The IRS will never ask me to pay taxes on them. I guarantee it. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:45:59
Another stupid question. I have keep the change with BOA. I wonder if I need to turn that off. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:47:20
Exactly! Always has been for me. I tried using it a few times and for buying coffe or a movie ticket is pretty worthless. For sending large amounts of money across the world it is very useful. If one person wanted to send a million dollars to another person the price right now will not work. That's why I know it must go up. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:11:42
I need to rephrase. They are not a scam but there are millions of better charities out there. Too much of their money goes to overhead just like red cross. I'm guessing the worst charity is the Clinton foundation where only 15% actually goes to charities. 85% goes to overhead. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 14:40:28
Was the hacker named 4chan?
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:04:51
It doesn't excite you or are we all in the boat that price doesn't matter ? All I care about is the price !
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:50:15
Taxes , taxes, we don't need no stinkin taxes. Seriously though...you paid taxes on Bitcoin ? The IRS cant even find emails let alone know what the hell Bitcoin is or how to tax it. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:46:09
There are 39000 people ahead of me. This seems pretty worthless. Maybe I'll get my pizza next year ?
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:49:21
Let me back up a bit. Buying coffee or a beer also makes sense for the merchant because of the low fees. I understand that too. The problem is in the US every transaction needs to be reported to the IRS(I think ? Since its selling property?
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:37:00
I get that. But what else ? If btc needs people to run nodes for nothing then it will surely fail 
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:08:37
What is the point of running a node if it does nothing for you ? I thought all miners needed nodes ?
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:32:12
20120. I couldn't find any that accepted 
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:46:40
I just read they give 3 cents on the dollar to charity. Now that can't be right. Ever since your post I haven't stopped reading. I'm down one hell of a rabbit hole in bad charities. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:53:43
This is really beginning to become stupid. I think I'm done with Bitcoin. Time to cash out. It was a fun ride. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:28:46
Jesus. I would be freaking out ! 
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:12:11
So true. I believe the divisions this administration has caused in this country is what makes us so apathetic. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:43:25
I agree with you on cold storage but when I research it I just get frustrated. Buy a New computer that has never touched the internet. Boot up Linux. Blah blah blah. Seems crazy and no way bitcoin will go mainstream will having to do all that. I do like the bitcoincards though for cold storage. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:02:54
absolutely! Do you know anyone who wants to turn their bitcoins into actual coins instead of a paper wallet or a bitcoin card ?
@_date: 2014-05-09 14:52:23
You must change to independent and change your withholding. I can help you out if you want 
@_date: 2014-07-04 17:34:34
I would have to agree. It was almost a year ago when McCain and Obama said we had to arm these friendly fighters and now magically they are in Iraq taking over.

Im confused on the backup method of mycelium...I have to write down a long list of letters ? What happens if I loose that or write the letters down wrong 
@_date: 2014-08-05 15:24:26
There is a video of it. Let me see if I can find 
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:35:59
Time to mine some x11, x13 coins 
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:35:52
I hope everyone is paying taxes on every sale you make on eBay. I also hope you pay your taxes everytime you purchase something on Amazon when sales tax was not taken out. I hope your kids are paying taxes on the lemonaide stands they have. The IRS can have their taxes from bitcoin when they fucking come take it. They can't track shit. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:04:15
I wouldn't say -2 is highly favored but I get your point 
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:00:38
Jim Cramer is the definition of a ponzi scheme 
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:28:47
I was so close to going but only if Va Tech was playing.  I really hoped they did so all my friends would finally see Bitcoin is not some fake Ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 12:22:56
Loved the video! 
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:18:50
Hahaha. Love the user name and account just created 
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:13:17
Thank you. Ill look into them when I get home from work 
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:57:50
What is the cheapest way for me to run a Node? I used to mine doge all the time but the energy use was not worth it. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:51:16
Yes of course FEC... What I'm taking about is right now anyone from any country in the wold can donate to your campaign...I'm sure that's going to backfire for candidates start accepting btc. I'm working on streamlining the process so the FEC will be ok with it 
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:20:42
I'd like to hear every angle to make my best judgement 
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:02:54
I keep trying to tell people this but I get downvoted
@_date: 2014-05-21 18:14:10
Yea I actually like it but now this idea of not being able to recover if another ddos attack happens then I'm scared. Have you tried mycelium? I actually like the standard bitcoin wallet for small purchases but I can't figure out how to put a simple password on it when it opens. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 14:58:21
I mean if you lost the trezor and the paper. Then what?
@_date: 2014-06-06 03:17:48
Its at 8am est check the volume and $20 increase instantly 
@_date: 2014-09-30 17:16:55
I don't care about a label. Just curious how you guys use it. Everyone is different from what I can tell. Like I said. I treat it as a commodity only. I don't care about how great it is to send money across the world. When i do need to do that I surely will use Bitcoin and hopefully circle will make it easy for the person receiving it. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:56:08
If what he says is true its technically not the wrong subreddit. All speculation of course 
@_date: 2014-07-11 13:34:43
Just buy another card and do a test run. Something you probably should of done before putting all your coins on something your not sure works 
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:18:44
You are right but what you mean is Harry Reed from Nevada did it not George Bush. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:51:53
Sounds perfect 
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:53:59
Are you forgetting about Obama ???
@_date: 2014-07-28 18:50:09
There is a bitcoin lawyer here in northern Virginia if you are interested 
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:02:52
Of course but why use a public library. That's just idiotic. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 22:14:27
I may actually be able to do that ! 
@_date: 2014-07-22 16:13:49
What about a video for an actual noob ? If I showed this to anyone in a bar they would turn it off in about 2 seconds 
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:23:19
Already watched it on Amazon. I really enjoyed it and think there needs to be a sequel. Since everything is moving so quick there is a lot of new info that can be added. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 11:46:51
And the ink on your paper fades and you lost all btc. Why do people feel so safe with a piece of paper ? There has to be a better way 
@_date: 2014-06-20 19:38:39
This was exactly what I was talking about. Each donation needs to be linked to a person which is why I thought just sending bitcoins to an address would not work. It looks like this service is free as of now !
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:14:03
Thank you very much. I've been a Bitcoin enthusiast for over a year but I have a hard time explaining. It's funny one of my friends a few weeks ago talked about the price. At least they are looking at it. Right? 
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:04:20
In the 1990s Bill Clinton took food prices and gas prices out of the inflation number which is the main reason why inflation is low. If you put those two numbers in you will see a drastically higher inflation 
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:19:31
Whole process 
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:28:56
Personally I'd hang on to it and keep reading. I buy about $50 a week of bitcoin and enjoying saving some and buying products with it. I guess as anyone will tell you read and watch YouTube videos on the side bar. Message me if you want to know more.  
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:12:00
I have an invite but haven't bought anything yet. Like you i used coinbase to autobuy every 2 weeks. I haven't been screwed yet by them but I'm sure it will happen. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:44:50
Yea I believe that's how it works but it's free. The part I don't like is it posts your transactions on a wall like Facebook for everyone to see. I figure you can turn this off. I downloaded it and right away it scanned my contacts and showed one of my friends sending money to another friend 2 years ago. Not much privacy there. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:50:39
I know a lot of people who let their parents do their taxes and they just do what's in the best interest of the parents. Now if you live at home I guess that's alright 
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:28:01
I know about those but I still think this article is bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 17:38:57
I'm not expert but that sounds like a targeting. I'm glad you were able to move the coins.
@_date: 2014-01-11 16:05:56
I was making a joke. Jeez 
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:04:16
Does circle have the auto buy function? I may switch to them if they do 
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:24:32
I normally like the help newcomers to bitcoin ... what country are you in ? Have you tried coinbase ?
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:34:21
First try could not log in. Tried again and it worked fine 
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:41:47
This really needs to be addressed asap. I heard the max you can donate is $100. Is that right ?
@_date: 2014-06-20 17:32:01
Have you seen this yet ? : 
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:46:06
Have you seen the illegal things this government has done ???
@_date: 2014-08-05 13:19:44
Which prediction ?
@_date: 2014-06-11 19:33:16
What do you mean ? 
@_date: 2014-08-21 14:42:42
You have Tor... You are now on the NSA watch list! 
@_date: 2014-05-28 20:20:26
If I can help you get all set up I wouldn't mind a small tip but I'd just like to help. Let me know when you have more questions 
@_date: 2014-07-04 19:21:43
Can you use an etf in an IRA?
@_date: 2014-05-28 17:21:41
Its like scrypt but uses about half the power. You just need to download the x11 mod of sgminer. You can use your own settings or try the default ones. Then to mine you will want to try trademybit or ipominer. Send me a PM if you need help 
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:32:16

You ever been to bluejacket brewery ? That's one of my favorite places in the city. I live in Centerville Va but work in DC as a manager for a contracting firm so I'm always in a new place. Do you do Sean's outpost full time ?

I'm down the street from the rayburn building. Is it open to the public ?
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:58:11
I did too. But this was a few days ago. I'm glade they listen to their users. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 18:53:47
It can't always go up 
@_date: 2014-07-08 14:07:24
Wow ...makes me wonder why bitcoin has not made it mainstream yet 
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:24:45
Hahahaha. So true ! Congrats on your earnings  btw !
@_date: 2014-07-14 16:05:32
I agree. Why can't you add a full password and 2fa at the login ? I know you can do 2fa for the vault though 
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:28:38
Ill hit you up closer to the conference. Been in DC before ? I can help you find places to go if you haven't  
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:48:48
Security and ease of use... If I hear one more person explain to someone the easiest way to secure your coins is to build a computer from scratch that has never touched the internet then.... Blah blah blah... This is why Bitcoin will never go mainstream If we can't secure them easily 
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:00:28
Yea. So have one program for your x11 mining and one for x13 is how I did it. There is probably a better way but I jump around pools a lot. X13 is weak right now so i went back to x11 but I suspect x13 will pick up soon 
@_date: 2014-06-25 18:17:58
Thank you. I will go back to sms 
@_date: 2014-07-07 14:59:01
I understand what OP is saying. The poker community as a whole should all embrace btc. Imagine winning a game and cashing out into btc instead of cash. Remember the store of thr wsop player who left his cash in a cab ?
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:32:28
My favorite part is when the guy started selling his miners. I did the exact same thing since it was not profitable anymore. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:54:45
I agree with you on that. I'm not pushing against you but trying to understand your stance on every aspect. I just feel there are so many aspects of politics that are more important. On the national level LGBT is a distraction from the real problems in America. For instance ... Iraq is on fire and Obama was at a LGBT dinner and Biden was at a soccer game 
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:14:32
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:43:37
Same in my state. Just saying there are lots of taxes people forget or just don't pay 
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:21:53
Do you realize how this government works? 3 weeks. Hahahahha
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:56:19
Haha. I hear ya! 
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:04:17
I like your prediction but you need to put all your thoughts in an easy way for everyone to understand because I think most people will think you are nuts. One thing I am 100% sure you are right is that the most wealthy people in the world are moving to cash and gold... Not stocks. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:19:20
This is not a p2p pool. This is simply a mining pool with the name p2p in it so people think they are mining p2p

I think this is a bullshit article created by Time Magazine. Why would anyone who understand bitcoin even want physical coins ?

Is there a legitament bitcoin debit card that someone in the US can get ?
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:23:18
That is a great explanation. I have coins that I will always hold which I put in the coinbase vault and I have coins that I spend which I leave in my wallet. I could see how it's frustrating for people who want to spend but have to wait 4 days for their coins. Isntant with coinbase and circle should fix that problem. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 14:50:29
How quick before cryptsy or coinbase issue 1099?
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:06:46
You need to prove you have money when you travel to the US?  Is this common? 
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:27:11
I think the card cost $15 but I can't remember if we were supposed to pay that upfront or after it comes out ...anyone know ?
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:24:24
Yes. It was very easy to set up. The big coin where you will get great returns is BOST...I think it forked but when its fixed we will get great returns. I'm on trademybit waiting for the fork to fix 
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:48:44

Obama was born in the US but the problem was it was to a different father. That is the conspiracy. You are correct. Either way he learned everything he knows from Frank Davis. It explains it all.

I was thinking of using it for long term cold storage in a firebox like you were saying. I'm just curious if anyone else has used

@_date: 2014-07-17 17:19:09
I'm sorry I didn't explain. It's for someone else and everyone is telling them to use western union. I want to teach them how to use bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:08:44
This is not for me. Someone in /personalfinance is asking for help and everyone is saying use a bank or western union. I want to introduce them to bitcoin and looking for your guys help 
@_date: 2014-06-21 05:05:28
What do you personally love about bitcoin ?
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:43:45
I can't remember if I paid. I'm guessing I didn't.

No you are correct. There were some big set backs in online gambling but Bush didn't do it or care about it.

I've been talking to every candidate that I can find that accepts bitcoin. As you can tell there is very few. I want to start a superpac for all candidates who accept bitcoin no matter their party affiliation. Having all of us on the same page will greatly help. Like I said before one of the other candidates talked with the FEC and they stated that any bitcoins thats donated direct to a qr code or bitcoin address can not be used. It has to go through an app like bitpay. Now I'm sure if I called or you called right now we would get a different answer. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 14:35:04
The exchanges all across the world. Don't see that happening. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:46:41
That's easy. The creators of Mt Gox stole it
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:00:59
Any thoughts on circle ? I can't imagine they really insure your bitcoins for free 
@_date: 2014-06-21 05:18:50
I know your new elected position will have nothing to do with it but what are your thoughts on the fed ?
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:58:10
Fuck the IRS! Don't pay taxes on your bitcoins so the US can fund more bombings in the middle east 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:30:31
So your saying the federal reserve didn't steal all the money ? Have you seen their balance sheets lately ?
@_date: 2014-05-29 17:18:13

@_date: 2014-07-17 17:24:53
Just trying to help. As of right now the person didn't yell and say bitcoin is stupid etc...I just want to compare western union fees to bitcoin. So far I can come up with is one party buys bitcoin in the UK with 34k US dollars in pounds. Then they transfer to the person in the US who has a coinbase account set up and linked to bank account. Then the person sells. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:41:38
Where do they find these writers ? Middle school English class ? I hate CNN
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:03:48
I've read 2 on bitcoin so far and one of them is awful. Bitcoin made easy ...it seems like some 10 year old made a science fair project and turned it into a book. I'm hoping someone made a good one 
@_date: 2014-06-18 01:48:34
Honestly I don't mind the fee that much if they really are insured. The bitcoin debit card looks very interesting. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:04:47
Why is lgbt so important ? There are a million more important things to discuss in America ...seems like a distraction which Obama uses 
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:11:00
I've been using bitcoin for a while. I just want to learn even more. So far the 2 books I read were way too simple. They a talk about buying bitcoin on eBay and other things that are completely outdated. I guess I'm looking for something more advanced 
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:36:48
Dogecoin all the way !
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:26:31
I get mine instantly. You must be doing something wrong 
@_date: 2014-06-04 11:26:10
Not trying to be mean but you are unemployed and living off of my hard earned taxes and you are "investing " in bitcoin ....hhhhmmmm
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:54:31
I agree. I'm just trying to find ways to get my friends into Bitcoin. It's becoming difficult. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 23:26:21
Thanks for the explanation !
@_date: 2014-05-28 16:00:28
With what you have you need to mine x11 coins 
@_date: 2014-06-10 05:12:40
You have a valid point ...that means you treat bitcoin like a commodity instead of a currency right ? That's what I do anyway 
@_date: 2014-07-02 18:01:41
Strange. I had a small problem and they responded in about 5 seconds and fixed everything. Amazing customer service 
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:13:55
So does every action by Obama but that doesn't seem to stop him... 
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:39:16
Are you worried that he was specifically targeted? How does someone break into a house just hoping there is a safe there? As an early adapter is he well known? The other day I was wearing a Bitcoin t-shirt in Vegas and now thinking I made myself a target. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:52:37
Or Michele Obama's college friend. Either way . Lol 
@_date: 2014-10-03 12:22:46
Loved the video! 
@_date: 2014-09-26 16:33:19
I would buy 2. Use one as a test to make sure you do everything right and if you like it use the second. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 23:26:02
Im really scared that history will repeat itself. How dumb are we ?
@_date: 2014-05-28 15:57:40
Sounds good I just feel like if I mess up writing down the numbers or forget the password of the encrypted file but I guess that's the sams thing for any situation.

Even as a state rep ... What percentage of your constituents are gay? I just see so many more important things to talk about  ...the GOP platform that you talked about is awful though 
@_date: 2014-10-23 17:16:24
I'm going to guess he didn't
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:06:57
You went from the dc go HK bitcoin conference ? You must be much more than an enthusiast :-)
@_date: 2014-09-26 12:45:50
Very simple :
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:12:37
There is so much talk of taxes on this sub that I'm guessing everyone here remembers to pay their state tax on every amazon purchase...I think not 
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:36:32
I figure if I used it to transfer money across the country or across the world then price does not matter at all but as a commodity I actually care about price. I'm one of the guys that was told about Bitcoin in 2011 by a guy in a Guy Faux mask and I thought he was cazy. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:41:37
I think 5 dimes uses bitcoin as well. They are amazing 
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:28:07

@_date: 2014-06-11 18:23:53
Anyone going to this ? I live here but I dont want to pay $300 bucks to listen to people talk. If I had an extra $300 I'd of course buy more btc. Ill be at the bar in the hotel if anyone is interested 
@_date: 2014-05-29 22:48:32
So ive been jumping back and forth between x11 and x13. I wish there was a switcher for automatic 
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:28:08
This is why bitcoin will not go mainstream until newer services like Circle go live 
@_date: 2014-05-28 17:35:15
Well there is a mod of sgminer with x11 mod in it. At trademybit it mines the best x11 coin and then converts to bitcoin for you. At ipominer it mines the newest x11 coin and most of the time that coin gets pumped so you need to sell it on your own. Last coin I was mining was XC coin. Check coinmarketcap on how that one did in the last 24 hours 
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:11:24
I love this write up and explanation!
@_date: 2014-07-03 02:52:46
Yea. That logic makes no sense 
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:02:43
I've read 2 on bitcoin so far and one of them is awful. Bitcoin made easy ...it seems like some 10 year old made a science fair project and turned it into a book. I'm hoping someone made a good one

Do you "trust" the company ?

If only there was an easier. Bitcoin will never succeed if this is how you have to be safe !
@_date: 2014-08-19 22:34:00
Funny thing I've heard people talk like that for real. I'm like Bitcoin will never be mainstream If this is what it takes
@_date: 2014-06-17 22:00:08
Are you the one who set up the bitcoin donation for this candidate ? I'd be really interested to talk to that person

There are plenty of people who think Bitcoin is for drugs and prostitution. Remember the first time anyone normal American found out about bitcoin was from Silk Road or the CEO of Bitcoin being arrested. I really hate the media and why do they keep showing physical coins whenever they write an article ???

Stop saying "such"... You guys sound like idiots 
@_date: 2014-07-31 17:19:07
No I'm saying the Fed prints money out of thin air ...there is no complexity in it. There is a reason the dollar has lost 97% of it's value since 1913
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:38:47
The funny thing is I also didn't think I had extra money but it really made me save money when I wasn't saving before. This was also a year ago when it felt like the price could never go down so I thought I was a genius. We are probably back to the fair market price now. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:36:01
I keep sending money to a Nigerian prince but he hasn't sent me any back. How long should I wait?  He keeps saying he needs a few more dollars to cover fees

I can probably see it being a currency but it will be many years from now. I just spent $12 in btc for a tshirt and now I'm thinking that I need to replenish that right away. That is in no way a definition of a currency. I spend it as a novelty. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 14:51:45
Days before 9/11 one of the hijackers had to send his remaining money back to his handler in the middle east. I heard he used a western union at a giant food store right across the street from the NSA. Go figure. Yes this article is just to give fear to the public about bitcoin.

What's a great online wallet that you guys use now that blockchain.info is crap now. I'm looking for one with backup functionality and a pin when I log in. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:54:53
I agree with what your saying. A complete ban by the US Govt is very possible. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 14:18:41
That's good to hear. The safer everyone makes their coins the better this community will be.  Did you use an easy to use set of instructions that you could share with the rest of us ? Until we can make backups easy for mainstream nobody will ever trust bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-10-02 14:09:57
Lol... Just messing with you. I'm sure there is one out there. I'll look around 
@_date: 2014-12-03 15:01:11

@_date: 2015-05-21 03:07:51
We are talking about it so it's already successful 
@_date: 2014-09-15 15:35:16
Haha. That's what I was thinking. Maybe one in a safe and one is a safe deposit box. So what is the consensus? Are these trezors the real deal? 
@_date: 2014-06-06 03:14:31
Its just great to see the reaction just like gold 
@_date: 2014-05-20 13:18:31

@_date: 2014-07-11 13:36:11
I would not tell banks about your bitcoin holdings. I heard a story about a family applying for a mortgage and it was denied because of a few purchases on Coinbase (who knows if this story is true but still scary )
@_date: 2014-05-09 14:50:33
I really wish people understood this!
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:01:32
That is great news ! 
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:40:09
I agree ...100% false 
@_date: 2014-12-10 14:45:53
I hope they don't make fun of it which I'm sure they will. I've also seen ESPN call it the St. PETERSBURG BOWL,  not the Bitcoin bowl. I'm guessing Bitpay will set them straight 
@_date: 2014-10-02 14:02:27
I could post my Qr code if that makes you feel better 
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:48:46
That doesn't address the problem with Authy though(If there is a problem)

@_date: 2015-05-21 11:31:49
That's what one very small section was about. Did you read the rest or just get a summary from the mainstream news?  
@_date: 2015-05-25 00:44:55
Yea. I don't do that. The IRS cant even keep track of normal taxes let alone anything with Bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-06-25 18:06:05
I can't remember but does Coinbase even use Google authenticator ? I guess ill go back to sms 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:18:04

Yes. Finding a simple way to use bitcoin is a step on the wrong direction. Have you tried explaining bitcoin to a friend? After my explanation they are like. Oh. Like Venmo!

He is against the FCC taking over the Internet which people like you think is Net Nutrality. It's just a buzz word.

I'm trying to figure out a way to show bitcoin to my friends. None of them need to send money overseas. I did send money to my sportsbook overseas. That was very helpful though. Again this only shows something illegal I can do. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:07:24
I know some of these words 
@_date: 2015-04-03 19:27:05

I agree with you. Can't have a revolution over night 
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:42:14
Amazon is very simple. Having to email two different companies to get a refund is insane. Also loosing money in the process is insane as well.

My refund experience was with bitpay. I need to see if maybe Coinbase is simpler. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:55:31
If we work together we may be able to figure out what this guy is talking about 
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:51:21
I still believe in bitcoin though. It being moved to another wallet is like forced savings though. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:19:55
Already done that ...then they look at it 6 months later and its now $3.50 and they still have no use for it. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:11:42
So if I buy something there is no way to get a refund. That's idiotic ...me

Thank you Coinbase. You have been amazing since day 1!
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:06:48
I understand all that but the average person doesn't care. I'm just looking for help on how to show everyday people how to use bitcoin. Its very hard and still nobody in this sub can show me a simple way. Circle and Coinbase help but we need something easier. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:56:21

Bitpay and PIA are reputable companies
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:31:01
That would make sense but that's not how it works with bitpay. I see it as a major flaw. The company was PIA VPN. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:07:32
I totally agree. All the behind the scenes crap is what makes bitcoin amazing.

Can you see if you can find Ron Paul ?

Its amazing what can happen when the government forces you to do something 
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:52:56
Paypal is devil. We all know that. So you use bitcoin to pay multiple bills in many countries ? I must be doing something wrong. I only have bills in this country. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:26:15
What about an app that I send you money. The app buys bitcoin. Sends to you and instantly sells that bitcoin. Easy as pie ...
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:33:04
I'm an early supporter and even heard about it in 2011(where I laughed at the person) but I just don't feel as excited anymore. It's great for forcing me to save money though. I have a weekly auto buy. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 20:02:30
Trying to find a way for the masses to use bitcoin is insulting ?
@_date: 2015-04-06 13:44:38
Relatively cheap ? Are you insane ? You mean very expensive but if you don't make more than 45k then all the taxpayers have to pay your subsidy. Just wait until the subsidies are taken away by SCOTUS and everyone will see the real price of health insurance now. Maybe all men don't need free OBGYN coverage ???
@_date: 2015-04-16 13:37:08
I'm very much aware of this. Like I said who cares how amazing bitcoin is if the average person has absolutely no use for it. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:38:11
OK I'll settle for Rand 
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:36:47
Did he just say Fedcoin where the fed reserve chair controls everything ....fuck that
@_date: 2015-03-12 15:50:52
We do sound like a cult. Lol. I think the average person will use bitcoin when they don't actually know they are using bitcoin. That is the killer app
@_date: 2015-03-02 17:15:30
Wow I didn't realize the one hop would not work. That really sucks 
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:38:35
Bitreserve looks legit!
@_date: 2015-03-12 14:45:12
I'm sorry OP. If things don't go perfect on someone's first try with bitcoin then they will be turned off forever. We already have to fight all the bad press and Coinbase is making it worse. I've had no problems with Coinbase but do you guys think we should start telling friends to use Circle instead ? I'm guessing he was not level 2 on Coinbase. Right ?
@_date: 2015-03-17 14:10:17
Except when they talked about Fedcoin and could not explain why they are different than Coinbase 
@_date: 2015-03-21 13:40:52
Why a ledger over  a trezor?
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:10:56
You would think we would be able to stream this. I think it's 2015...
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:35:27
Why can't you just send the Coinbase wallet to an android wallet such as mycelium then use that to fund the gambling site ?
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:39:18
I'm guessing the servers don't know much about it. I live in DC and can go try it out if anyone is interested 
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:27:31
Anything is better than a private bank printing money then lending it to the us government 
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:04:46
You get it !
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:42:46
There are new coins everyday. I used to pump and dump that crap a year ago 
@_date: 2015-03-04 12:58:17
You actually are correct. Not sure why the down vote. Even my gf who knows very little about bitcoin said it was obsolete already
@_date: 2015-03-30 16:41:09
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:05:00
His dad has been trying for even longer than that. I believe there will never be an audit of the fed. They get to keep printing money forever 
@_date: 2015-03-10 15:37:18
That is it exactly. No need to get into the specifics of bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:11:26
First time I heard about mining I had no idea what to expect ! Then again I heard about bitcoin in 2010 and laughed my ass off at the person
@_date: 2015-02-20 15:41:11
Just saying. Be safe. Use vpn and there are better sites out there now. Just trying to help 
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:30:35
Yea. They audit themselves ...
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:29:43
I thought this show was a great way to show bitcoin to novices.  What did you think? 
@_date: 2015-03-06 16:45:50
Thanks Obama 
@_date: 2015-03-04 16:39:15
Combine the two and its a great into to Bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:37:24
Is it true all minners run a full node but not at full nodes are mining ?
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:44:33
What do you like to use? 
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:13:09
Haha. Taxes. Yea... 
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:54:35
I've heard all the bad things about Coinbase but I personally have never had a problem. I guess I'm just lucky. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:57:21
If they are not open to it then its on them to wait for the wire transfer. The goal for bitcoin should be the average user does not know they are using bitcoin. For instance. When I explain bitcoin to a friend they simply say I'll just use venmo and honestly they are right. Its a lot easier.

Maryland ?
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:09:47
The problem is that when people use reusable bags they forget to wash them and then they get sick from diseases. I hate reusable bags. Maryland also has a rain tax. Now that makes sense. Lol 
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:20:32
What wallet was he using at the beginning? 
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:07:20
Wow. Someone is angry!

I'm an idiot. Of course its 5pm central not eastern 
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:13:36
It really sucks. I work in Maryland. What does that 5 cents do anyways?
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:30:43
Can you then explain the main difference between a node and mining. What is the incentive for a node ?
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:47:08
I swear they went by a different name last year. Is that right? 
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:36:53
Sounds about right to me 
@_date: 2015-03-17 14:17:13
Worked fine for me. I think maybe it has to do with what bank you use. No problems with circle or Coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:04:27
Haha. You follow someone on reddit. You may seriously have mental problems. Btw using Latin does not make you sound inteligent. You sound like a psycho. Funny thing is this is the second time someone used that phrase with me. Been following me for a few days now you psycho? 
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:23:28
What's it like being unemployed and following someone on reddit? Does it pay well? 
@_date: 2015-03-20 20:03:01
They want a Fedcoin controlled by the Federal Reserve 
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:01:00
Just like the NSA follows the rules of not spying on US citizens. You make me laugh 
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:25:31
Never heard of it?  Have you used it? 
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:02:29
This may be the best post on reddit. Ever! 
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:46:06
Seriously. You need to relax. I always hear bitcoin lovers are assholes.  You just proved the point. Such asshole. Haha 
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:46:41
Just tried. Worked fine 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:34:13
I'm going to check out CampBX. If there is a referral program ill put you in. Not sure if there is one 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:14:02
No idea. I was hoping someone had some insight. What do you use ?
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:39:00
Which is perfect for Bitcoin. No central bank. You can't shut it down !
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:30:48
Thank you ... You are right !

If you pay taxes on bitcoins you are an idiot. This government will never know what you are doing. How is their obamcare website doing ?

It must be lonely. Sitting in your mom's basement. Unemployed! It's funny because I know I'm right. You've been attacking me for days. With two different names. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:30:03
That makes no sense. I knew the computer I purchased would loose value the second I bought it or even it lost value on the shelf. Bitcoin is going up in value 
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:41:33
I never had to send utility bill. Honestly it was very simple and I'm level 2 now.

Remote wipe of your phone would be helpful I would guess 
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:10:32
This is the second post on the api key. I guess I'm lucky mine was not enabled. Coinbase was acting very strange last night. It was hard to log in. I guess it was a hack. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:55:20
I didnt know there was minimal withdraw. Strange. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:36:16
Should I send you some bitcoin. Maybe it can help you with your unemployment problems. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:31:48
I'm starting to agree with this statement. I don't know enough though about it 
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:38:34
I don't need to read your post. You are a retard   . 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:37:26
Ill send you the info tonight

Try going into a bank of America and withdraw over $1000. A manager will come over and ask you why. Its none of their god damn business

@_date: 2013-11-14 01:30:18
That makes sense. I know it won't change my amount I just like the idea of having one. I'm buying slowly and can't afford more than $20 every few days. I'm buying through coinbase 
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:09:55
You are so right !

Did you get your bitcoins yet 
? If not ill sell even for PayPal. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:37:00
I hope u all know this is a lie 
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:56:54
I agree about that but these stories just seem hilarious. Like trolling
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:04:44
How about for sports wagers ?
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:49:22
I think it has to do with what bank you are using...same thing in the online gambling world. surprisingly I use bank of America and have no issues 
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:00:10
I think I tried almost ten times and it finally worked 
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:53:33

Not sure really. Based in US is a bit attractive 
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:16:55
What was your best first purchase with Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:34:01
You are right but you are missing the fed reserve problem 
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:21:42
How can anyone up vote this idiot ? If you actually have this much money get into one of the exchanges 
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:34:03
No you are correct. For some reason I thought each one had its own unique address. Thank you all !
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:12:49
Bitcoin use on a gambling site ? Future use ?
