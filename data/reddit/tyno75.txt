Well if you want to split hairs, there have not even existed "hundreds" of fiat currencies. I thought you were just using it as an expression so I did the same. Yes it's not the first time a fiat currency fails, not even the 1st time this century, Zimbabwe dolar also failed. But this does not mean they cant work. In both this cases of failure one thing that was common was an Authoritarian leader that thought printing money creates wealth, which any educated economist knows it simply does not work like that.

There are literally hundreds of Fiat currencies that have worked. Whats your point?

Exactly, most times a Fiat currency fails is because of an Authoritarian government that thinks it can create wealth by printing money, it just does not work like that.

Wow you really dont know shit about economics, só I Guess this argument truly is pointless. Anyway , i doubt this Will get through your thick head, but declíning prices lead to Multiple small companies to go bankrupt because they cannot make ends meet, and mostly only big corporations manage to survive because they have way lower production costs. This is bad because more monopolies would arise and the economy overall would slow down.

They hyperinflate if the monetary authorities have no accontability. As long as they have strict rules and explicitly stated goals for inflation, it can work. In the countries that hyperflation occurs the leaders are either too greedy , too desperate or have too much power ; or a combination of all.

"i dont understand your argument, you must be stupid" this is how you sound. No counterarguments , just closed-minded assumptions. I pity your ignorance

That is a list of ALL dead currencies, not just Fiat currencies. For a great part of human history our currencies have been backed by some precious object, like gold or silver. Fiat currencies , although they have been used in the ancient past , concerning the last hundreds years it is relatively recent. Until the end of the Bretton Woods agreement most world currencies were still techinacly indexed to gold. Fiat currencies are a normal thing only from the past 50 years.

Funny how just because Im pointing out fallacies in your arguments you automatically decide to make assumptions about my beliefs, that says more about you than it does about me. I never said inflation was a good thing. If you had asked I would have Said the ideal would be to have 0% inflation , but because deflation is more dangerous than inflation for the economy the inflation target should be something like 0.1 to 0.5%. i would also have told you that the way we calculate inflation right now is misleading since it doesnt take into account house prices and stock values. So Next time instead of taking assumptions out of your ass in a desperate attempt to defend your point, try to think a bit and maybe try to see things from a different perspective

I literally did my bachelors in economics and am currently enrroled in my masters in polítics and economics. But thank God some random dude on Reddit can enlighten me about basic economic assumptions

Im all for Bitcoin and alt coins as a whole. But to suggest Fiat currencies do not work based off the Venezuelan situation is simply ridiculous and intelectually dishonest

Money is everything that is generally accepted as exchange for goods and services, Bitcoin becoming the main form of money literalkly depends on everyone accepting it as such, so this is a welcme change.

Someone is pumping it and a dump should follow on a couple of days, beware.

No cryptocurrencies that currently existe, including Bitcoin, is a viable means of storing value, they simply are too volatile. This article explains it well

It's a start of a better economy and the hope for the future.

Well, technically, since all oil must be bought with dollar, dollar may be the only supposed fiat currency in existence that is actually backed by something, oil.
