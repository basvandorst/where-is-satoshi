Tell your buddies to let me respond to you.  If they let this post through to make it look like I can respond, they'll block any edits a or other posts so....there you have it.  
My agenda is I have bitcoins and I'd like them to actually go up in value.  Your company has attempted to stop that at every turn.

You tell me...I can't even respond to you.

Ughh...this is just NOT what bitcoin was supposed to be.  I remember when everyone was so excited about instant, cheap transactions.  You can actually see when the campaigning started to put an end to that.    
What they don't tell you in that video is how the payment processors are going to be large and centralized.  They just shifted centralization so they can make more money.

Greg shoots the ideas down...devs create an altcoin.  Just ask Dash and a handful of others at a minimum. 
It's not hard to understand.  Also, it's not like other coins don't already have a larger block size.  Some even have...wait for it...a dynamic block size.  Oh no...no he didn't.  No way.  That's impossible.  That can't be.  Oh lord...NO!  Greg says it can't work but it is...Oh my god!  The world is coming to an end.  Master Greg was wrong.  Oh lord!  


I typed those words.  Just how many times and how many ways can you guys be so wrong?
