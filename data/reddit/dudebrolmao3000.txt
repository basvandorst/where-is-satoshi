Gavin thinks Craig is satoshi. Gavin is the one who talked the most with Satoshi so id rather listen to him than an army of trolls.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:14:36
I wonder what that actually means, because from my perspective all the people that were in bitcoin from the start that got smeared by this channel and the legions of shills forked bitcoin -- you know, how open source is supposed to work, and started working on a client that was actually in line with satoshis vision instead of making the system worse, first in favour of segshit and when that didnt work, for a pie-in-the-sky that were supposed to be done a couple years ago and completely changes bitcoin into a centralized shitstain giftcard system.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:30:09
You figure wrong. Many other coins wouldnt see the problems bitcoin is seeing now because they weren't taken over by banks pretending to "we will fix bitcoin soon guys promise!!". Ethereum has a higher transaction count than bitcoin yet not insane fees. Bitcoin Cash will similarly never run into that problem, even at thousands of times higher transactions, it will always stay cheap to send.
Stop letting the propaganda of this channel get to you. Bitcoin were taken over by the banks and this is their propaganda outlet.

I wasnt talking about chums being chummy, i was talking about the control and angling of information. I was talking about this being a propaganda channel.
Good day!
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:54:16
I agree. There's only one bitcoin now and it is Bitcoin Cash. Same chain. Still has instant transaction(and even more secure now) that Bitcoin removed and in addition Bitcoin now has segwit chain which changes the rock-solid proof of transactions on chain to a "maybe" thereby destroying what Bitcoin was for a potential 0.4 mb max increase. Whoopee.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:20:12
Nono! The real deal is a kind of giftcard setup where both people who want to send money to eachother both have to pay money to put them inside a channel!!!
That is CENTRALIZED!!!
Like a BANK!!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:39:15
Segwit changed the chain to be less secure. For example with a segwit transaction it may prove difficult in a court that you sent that transaction. They destroyed bitcoin for a potential max 1.4 mb, that isnt even enough.
And as a programmer i can confidently say they complicated the codebase for no good reason at all. A block increase would have solved all the problems and introduced none. It's all bs and propaganda.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:41:31
Reddit is a controlled source though. Just like this channel is. Complete manufacturing of consent, only real talk when the mods are asleep. Sorry. But welcome to reality.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:23:07
That is how all crypto scale. Ethereum even has a dynamic blocksize that scales based on transactions. Bitcoin could of had the same but banks run the bitcoin i loved now and propagandizes people in this very channel. Sorry, but that is reality.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:08:43
It's just lies man... Bitcoin were taken over by the banks. Blocksize has never been a problem, you can buy several terabyte disks for 30$ or so... It's just something the people who control this sub said because they wanted to kill bitcoin...
If youve ever read the whitepaper, bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin... It also has all the original devs.. all the people smeared on of course as normal operation for a propaganda outlet.
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:28:53
Maybe it's because people want to buy LTC and you (usually) have to buy BTC first to do it =)
(that's why i bought anyway)
@_date: 2017-02-06 11:53:29
i don't get how they can have a sponsored link to the founder of the website... how does that work? :S
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:09:35
Hey! I used to think the world was round too you nincompop!
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:10:56
Wtf. LN hubs will have people's private keys???
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:14:42
I think it's sad that this is what the core devs want to turn bitcoin into then, or is it only luke jr that wants fees to go up and the main chain to be astronomically expensive to interact on?
Do i understand it correctly that i need to give a LN hub access to ALL of my cash if i want to make one small transaction?
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:13:22
word. one can learn a lot of the human mind just by watching both of these subs and seeing how everyone is so sure of himself.
@_date: 2017-04-08 21:42:17
If you read Satoshi's whitepaper you will realise the whole reason bitcoin works is because miners are supposed to be greedy. The idea that the devs forgot to account for this fact means they are completely incompent at best or malicious at worst. Yes, it's that simple.
@_date: 2017-04-11 13:00:29
Also. Id's are gotten by sellers on localbitcoins and sold on the darkmarket.
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:19:31
This is true. Hopefully it doesn't drag all crypto reputation down in the process. Because that could take 10 years to fix...
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:45:26
not if blocks are full. it's pissing me off how bitcoin has managed to get BOTH slower AND more expensive the last years. All for a "solution" that the devs didnt account for the fact that perhaps miners don't want it. Jebus crust. start your downvote engines idgaf.
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:59:52
Such evil miners, not at all the fault of the devs that failed to anticipate it. /s
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:53:10
How exactly can bitcoin wait? What if bitcoin gets a new influx of users like it just had? What happens the day people open The New York Times and sees the headline "Bitcoin Network Clogged! Transactions stuck!".
I'll tell you what will happen. Your beloved core group will have achieved their objective, bitcoin and crypto's will be sat back 10 years and all you over-propagandized tools in this sub that do nothing but excuse the fact that bitcoin has gotten /slower/ AND more expensive will wonder what hit you. Then a new post will be posted on this sub blaming some new boogeyman and half of you STILL won't get it.
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:31:54
yes, but if when trying to send funds and get an exorbitant fee and slow transaction time they won't neccessarily become true believers either.
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:45:57
It's basic market economics. The market is ruled by perception. If people are seeing that bitcoin can't scale that will also be reflected in price. Especially if their first exposure to bitcoin is being sent money they can't use until a day later...
If you trade altcoins you will see this is glaringly obvious. If some coin has positive news the price goes up. This will happen to bitcoin too if they ever fix the scaling problem. When you factor in the noob factor(and believe me, the trollbox on poloniex will make you realize how many 0% technology-knowledge people are in crypto) that are suddenly happy about bitcoin because now they can actually send money and pay without insane fees, the price will go through the roof.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:46:38
Or what if i made a company that every year got worse, both slower and more expensive and "gained" regular outtages where noone could use my product for a while. Do you think my stock would rise?
Would you be hanging out on the company website(this sub) and defending my company and blaming the evil users for not wanting to eat my fishsticks... LOL.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:32:17
A company spends years upon years developing a feature of their product "that will fix everything" and meanwhile brushes everyone's worries away by saying "by the time we have more users(blocks full) we will have a solution, chill out". Then the day comes when the blocks are full and no solution is ready. Their project actually becomes /worse/ than it was many years ago. Now, in addition to being slower, it is also more expensive. Do you think anyone following this product and company would blame another set of users(miners, because they use the bitcoin software) for not implementing their "holy grail" software change(which upon closer inspection doesn't fix the problem at all) or should you blame the company for not seeing this coming?
That's assuming no malicious intent. I think it's far more likely core isn't actually stupid but is now dancing to the tune of the CIA and/or big banks. Theyll try to make an example out of bitcoin. All the newspapers will write about how bitcoin has failed, and the common man won't be able to understand why and will assume it is a story about how crypto can't succeed. It will set back crypto for decades.
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:23:00
No. It happened many years ago. People have been saying hodl for years.
@_date: 2017-05-17 23:05:15
If you read Satoshi's paper you will see that the whole point of bitcoin was to be a peer-to-peer money network too. Satoshi also write about the bank system we have today so it is clear that he was hoping bitcoin could encroach on that market. The only way this can happen is if we can gather in all the normies too. The normies won't come until the system is better than the alternative, it's that simple. Everything that impedes that, is a negative.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:09:37
hohoho. you people have been propagandized so well. if only it wasn't for those "eval miners". lol.
If i had a company that produced fishsticks, would you join an online campaign to smear everyone who didn't like my fishsticks? lol. propaganda to the max.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:25:18
well, im not going to go into a technical discussion of what is safest between trezor and tails because i have no clue, but i'd say if you don't think tails would be safe enough for something like this youre pretty far into lala land or have the nsa after you or something.
edit: i just want to make the point that i see a lot of people recommending trezor which costs money to hold your coins, when tails or just not being a complete technical illiterate would do.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:14:48
well ok. if you are "grandma-tier" competent with computers then i suppose paying for something like trezor could be meaningful, but i also think most people on this sub would be able to put tails on a usb and reboot their computer.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:58:23
or, you know, just send them to electrum and write down the secret code on a piece of paper and hide it inside your nonfunctional fireplace?
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:50:52
or use linux. or download tails on a usb, install electrum on tails(i think it's already there, anyone confirm?) and send the money there. then write down the private key and hide it inside your cat.
