Aw come on, that actually looks like original content. At least it's not a macro or even a rage comic!
... ok maybe it **is** a macro. I dunno.

Thanks once again! I will definitely stay away from MtGox.
A new question now: I'm a translator. I currently accept payment through PP and would really like to be able to accept Bitcoin as well. Can I do this with a locally-hosted wallet? Are there any online wallets you would recommend? I just registered as a merchant on BIPS.me but... *^I ^have ^no ^idea ^what ^I'm ^doing ^here*
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:43:14
Thanks! =]
So I contacted my banks and things don't look too good. I'm probably going to burn USD 30 on the wire transfer alone. And then the thought struck me – is there anywhere I can buy Bitcoin using just an international credit card?

Hi! Am I too late?
I'm pretty interested in buying some BTC, I live in Brazil. I understand the ~~best~~ most convenient way to do this is via SLL at VirWox. Only 6% fees, [according to bitcoin.it]( It seems a perfect end to "that leftover balance" that's been sitting around in my PayPal account. Is there a better way to do it from here? Thanks!
EDIT: I should point out the current BRL:USD is roughly 2:1, making 1 BTC roughly 400 BRL, and the two people I found on localbitcoins.com were charging 500 BRL -- i.e., a 25% fee/markup...
Although the prices on VirWox have been absolutely skyrocketing over the past few days, seems like more SLL holders are getting wind of this PayPal -&gt; Bitcoin workaround... Oh man...
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:43:11
Yes. It's much easier than it would appear to a noob. Each wallet can have many many addresses. This should be part of the Bitcoin tutorial.
Also, someone should make a bitcoin tutorial.

As long as you can later give them to someone else in exchange for things, they can be anything at all, even something worthless like bits of paper! Now is that magic or what?
@_date: 2013-10-30 05:54:40
I understand, thanks! Looks like a personal wallet is the way to go. I don't plan on converting Bitcoins to Reals anytime soon... :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 02:02:24
Incredible! How strongly trust affects value! It's such a shame the page with those pictures is gone :( And wouldn't you know it, the [Wayback Machine]( reports that "Page cannot be crawled or displayed due to robots.txt." Too bad, that was a historic event in the history of Bitcoin. Would have been nice to see the pics.

This discussion makes me think of paper money:

Ouch, I hope you bought back in as soon as you could!
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:02:26
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:21:47
No way! I use that to make deposits into Bitcoin exchanges!
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:24:42
Want to give me your Bitfinex referrer code? We both win. I think. At least I get 10% off fees for a month, so.
@_date: 2013-11-04 06:36:37
Hi, can you explain what you mean about mercadobitcoin? I was about to place an order from them (about 7 hours from now!!)
@_date: 2013-11-01 22:35:53
Hey, sorry if I'm hijacking this thread but... I live in Brazil, would it be possible for you guys to accept credit cards for international buyers? I would gladly pay the listed fees, it is **very** expensive to wire transfer/western union money abroad, but international credit card purchases are comparatively inexpensive.
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:36:55
Hey, thanks!! I just signed up, they said they'll review my submission, seems professional!
Say... the problem with depositing from PayPal/credit card is that these allow some sort of refund for a certain number of days, right? Couldn't I make a PayPal transfer, and after the 30-day period my payment becomes authorized? Or are things so volatile that it would be risky of me to trust an exchange for that long with my money?
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:10:38
Oh I can "code" in Basic and Visual Basic, I just don't think those really count anymore =P
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:46:48
Wow, this is hilarious... Awesome work! 
This makes me wish so badly that I had caught on earlier and been a part of this "landmark" moment in Bitcoin history! I wish I was there to see it! It's too bad nothing like this will ever happen again.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:30:06
Yep, I made a nice 5% profit from buying super-low Feathers and reselling them on Cryptsy. I guess that's what I deserve for idling on exchange sites.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:45:59
Did some news break I haven't heard about? What happened 1h + 3h ago?
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:19:09
Whoa, holy economic restriction! I don't even ... That's crazy! That's like saying only businesses can make international phone calls. It's a basic economic freedom... It would be unthinkable here in Brazil to forbid people from making wire transfers (it's just expensive as fuck).
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:07:21
Don't even joke... Soon enough we'll see churches accepting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:09:07
Or at least make sure they accept Bitcoin! amirite?
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:31:39


So... more famous than it even needs to be!! And more wealthy (market cap) too!

I can't really code. What's your excuse?
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:38:30
Do you think Bitcoin will still be the protocol in use 100 years from now? 20?
Don't get me wrong, I know we're talking about a difference in scale like quantum mechanics and general relativity. For the next several years Bitcoin will definitely be the Standard coin (barring a catastrophe like some currently-unknown flaw). But I don't have any doubt that in 50 years things will have changed. If Bitcoin is like Linux, I don't think we've seen X yet, whatever it will be. And Yggdrasil still exists, but is no longer the distro used by most people.
Edit: Thank you for your article, though. I've been leery of even owning Litecoin, and will certainly follow your suggestion and not buy LTC, only sell (and mine). :)

Hi, could you explain what you mean about Mercado Bitcoin? I've been looking and looking but have yet to find another way to buy Bitcoin here in Brazil! :(
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:03:00
Can the protocol be updated to newer encryption strengths? If not 2-4 years from now, then 8-16, at some point even 1 kilobit encryption is going to be obsolete. (And I don't even think it'll take until 2030.)
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:32:33
Thanks yet again!  I was wondering where all the Brazilian Coiners were hiding...
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:13:09
How do the time-travellers *know* they are supposed to trade at those specific values?!?!?
Or is it a natural consequence of time-travelling that the buy/sell prices work out like that? I would have expected non-linear traders to have some sort of crazy spiking and crashing effect on a currency...
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:14:55
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:30:39
If you want to think of it that way, but then you open the door to defining "loss" as "profits that are so low that they are no longer profitable" and whatnot.
IANAT, but I think it's relatively subjective what a "crash" vs. "correction" is. Of course, if you meet someone whose portfolio just crashed and try to convince them it only corrected, good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:21:18
Ha! Nice. Relax about the source, I believe you.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:51:51
I think you mean: What happens if a government tries to "buy out" all the Bitcoins?
I don't think any government would try that, it's pretty doomed to fail spectacularly for whoever tried. They would never obtain *all* of them, and the remainder would just gain more granularity forever.

Excellent analysis! 
Uh, this may be a moronic question but is this something I should be worried about? How do I "bite down on the coin" to see if the bitcoin being traded to me for fiat is valid?
@_date: 2013-10-30 04:56:10
Thank you so much for your help!
~~Hm... What about places that will accept an international wire transfer?~~ (Wow, apparently Reddit conversations have a bit of a blind window at times. Thanks for pre-emptively answering my question!)
What's your opinion on Litecoin?
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:35:13
I'm buying! Strictly as a favor, you understand.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:20:52
Hey, since we're on the subject, has anyone added USD to their Bitstamp accounts using AstroPay?
I did. And, because of a laggy page (I think), instead of automagically making a transaction *through* AstroPay, I was simply redirected to their home page. "Okay," I thought, and bought a USD100 AstroPay card, ready to "deposit it" into Bitstamp.
But it doesn't look like there's any way to do that. I registered a support ticket about 8 hours ago, but still no response. I imagine they were just busy with their site falling down. I hope they can help me...
If they *can't* help me, where can I spend that AstroPay card? Anyone ever hear about it before?
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:23:26
I think you accidentally a link though. Or a self.post.
Edit: looked for a link. Found nothing. Giving up.
@_date: 2013-11-03 16:22:42
Could you elaborate for a noob please? =D
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:39:13
You know what, I don't actually think you're all that wrong, but this doesn't change much. I'm just going to continue to exchange my fiat paper bills for "fiat" crypto hashes all the same, because I am an itsy bitsy cog in the capitalist gearwork. Good points though, very interesting article you dug up.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:10:38
I thought mining was massively unprofitable by now. No?
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:16:46
Hmph. Lousy no-good scammers, ruining things for us honest hard-working forex traders... &amp;
Since I have your ear, I've got just one more question: how can I verify a Bitcoin market's trustworthiness? [Mercado Bitcoin]( has the lowest rates around, but how can I make sure I can trust them?
@_date: 2013-11-04 12:19:01
Thank you, I've been reading that thread for the past few minutes and he *seems* legit... I mean sure, we can take his word for it... Probably...
