Gemini Activetrader is 0.25% maker and 0.35% taker. Not quite as low as Coinbase Pro appparently, but pretty reasonable and I've had no major issues with the platform

So if it goes to $12500 and you sell, and then it goes straight to $13k then $14k then $15k, are you going to FOMO and buy back in at a higher price point?  Maybe it will drop to $11k (or $10k or $5k), or maybe it never will drop that low ever again.  If you believe in the asset long term, keep what you have and just buy more at every dip. That guarantees that you have a seat at the table if Bitcoin really has a future.  If you're trying to time the ups and downs... Good luck. You're gonna need it.

I've done this. It's a 1:1 transfer. But while your funds are at the betting site, the value of Bitcoin may change. Let's say you transfer 0.1 Bitcoin worth $1000 to the betting site. You place a bunch of bets, winning some and losing some. You break even (good job!) and you've still got $1000 in your betting site account. But during that time the price of Bitcoin doubled, and now your $1000 only gets you 0.05 Bitcoin when you withdraw. 
Also there will be transfer fees, which in my experience are very very small. And also there will be processing time when you withdraw, which I think a betting site may take advantage of if they have the chance. If there are big swings in Bitcoin price during the 2-3 day window when your payment is "processing", I think the site may use that to give you as little Bitcoin as is defensibly possible.
In general betting sites are pretty sketchy and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone
Edit: It's possible that I misunderstood your phrasing and, based on the way you're thinking about it, it's not a 1:1 transfer. When you deposit Bitcoin, you definitely don't lock in an exchange rate in perpetuity for the funds deposited. Hope that makes sense

It does if you want bread and you have a bitcoin but you don't have a million dollars

Major retainers are partnering with service providers that allow people to spend Bitcoin to buy things. Those service providers previously didn't exist. That's not nothing.
