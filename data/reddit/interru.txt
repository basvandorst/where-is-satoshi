Because this was made by someone who uses Bitcoin and who wants to convince other people of it, otherwise there would be atleast some criticism.

I agree that isn't most bitcoiners but i disagree that _only_ Gentoo users matter. Because what we create if we only optimize for Gentoo users is a closed group of circle jerks: With every distinction from the mindset of general people we raise the bar for people to enter the Gentoo community. It would be stupid to cut _every_ relation to outside.
PS: I like your proposed solution ;)

Well, I am gentoo user and I don't think this is a good default. Then again are most of the default settings/behavior in gentoo shit.
Also, this affects the network and therefore I can understand the rage.

Not *hell* but germany (where I live), and I know for sure that this had happened to me. And sometimes I did get a complete page of negative commentary. ;)

If you assume that the PHP interpreter is programmed correctly.
[I personally have my doubts!](

Most of the arguments are already mentioned. I don't think repeating them over and over does change anything.
The question is what the user expects: I once installed ntpd on my server (gentoo). What I have expected was that the default settings were, that openntpd ist restricted to localhost. So I went with the default settings in good faith and excessive laziness. I think you can guess what happened next: DDoS happened and my server was part of it.
On the one hand, it was a stupid decision to trust the default settings. On the other hand, if this happens to often and I can't trust gentoo to have sane settings, why should I use it anymore? (Spoiler: Rhetorical question. I don't boycott gentoo because of this small drama)
So in your opinion you believe it's a good thing to blacklist certain addresses which does affect the network to a certain degree. But as you can see, most bitcoiners seem to disagree/expect something else. So what would be the sane default?

If I am right Davout runs bitcoin-central?!
They refuse to give my sister her money back:
She had traded some money. After a while she wanted to withdraw  but bitcoin-central then refused because they had increased their security and implemented KYC which my sister couldn't provide fully (she provided her german goverment ID but had not a utility bill; she lives currently in a student dorm).
The result: The money is in her account but she can't retrieve it.
