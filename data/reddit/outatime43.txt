Why not do an ACH? It only takes a week and is more reliable.

Nice app! Too bad I have iOS.

That 50% rise in a month sure is a drag.

And it’s environmentally friendly. Nice. I’d do it if I were younger.

If it goes up too fast and crashes then people will scream to shut down the exchanges etc. kill the golden goose.  Steady is better

Check with your bank. They should be able to see the ACH pending and give you more info.

This is great news. We need an exchange with a TRUE connection to the fiat world. Let's be honest, without an assurance of being able to exchange these things for USD's or Euro's, etc. , then prices would collapse .

The IRS considers crypto currencies as real assets for tax purposes. You aren't liable for taxes unless you sell. Think house, stocks, etc.  They are considered capital gains that only result in 20% tax rate if held more than 1 year. Hodl.
Oh , and pay your taxes. Don't be foolish. That's really all they care about.

The defense is that Bitcoin is not considered currency legal tender in the state so money transaction laws do not apply. It’s no different than selling some gold coins to a friend.
