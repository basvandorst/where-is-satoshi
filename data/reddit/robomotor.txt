Holy Fucking Shit. We all knew this was happening but now we have absolute proof. What in the fuck....

Or what about you know.. Like spending it? It's value is not in how it's exchanged but in how it's used. Its working as intended. How much its valued is meaningless if you actually use it rather than pretending it's a commodity.

You can see that after the first two rolls around the board the game is more or less won. The rest is just about concentration of wealth. So sort of like real life?

It's crazy right? Like who would own that private police force? That guy? Uh no, that's not how private armies have ever worked. The way police are organized now is the closest us peasants have ever been to owning our own armies. Sure it has its own issues but I'd take it over super rich individuals being able to buy their own any day of the week. That dude smoking bath salts.

Tried to use one yesterday and the markup was close to 20%. I get a better deal on localbitcoins.com for crying out loud.

Am I the only one that thinks that buying bitcoin is sort of missing the point? Buying or selling bitcoin on an exchange does nothing for the long term viability of bitcoin. For it to be adopted widely people have to actually spend it on something.
I don't understand these posts. It's like going on a gold subreddit and saying I just bought a nugget! So happy to finally be a part of the gold nugget community! Who cares...

This just reinforces my idea that investing or speculation on coins is a terrible for the health of the crypto economies. The only thing that can increase value in bitcoin is when we spend it on actual stuff. You know, like a real economy.
