Ask them publicly what bank they advice you to go. Discuss in public that you are a human with free will, you want banks to be open minded for this. Your free will to choose, to use bitcoin. For all the benefits of include the future, the internet of money. Or is the future what your bank decide for you? Feels like slavery.

*  EN: So far I can't imagine a situation where bitcoins would be considered a reserve currency but we are looking at how this market is developing, we are noting certain risks there and we've informed the market players that we identify these risks and because there are(inaudible) many representatives in that particular sector that could be resorted to some dubious operations and transactions. You know the kind of policy we conduct about dubious transactions, but we are watching over the development of this market and see that for consumers there are certain attractions in bitcoin's mobility, expediency, low cost, so this is something definitely the market will be welcoming so we will be watching with attention and, if necessary, regulate it.

The truth about businesses and transparency is that most businesses hate transparency. A nice Ted Talk about how scary the Giant Brands are for transparency: 
Yet, Internet of Things and Internet of Living Things are absolutely great opportunities for Agriculture. Blockchain can register the growing of your crops by analyzing the mutation between life circles. I've done a research on this myself for several years, but it's not at a scientific level.

How many trillions USD are created out of thin air since January?
1 USD in January is simply worth less than 1 USD today. This is what your banks and government do, they silently rob you by printing trillions USD overnight, so your 1 USD get worth less.
So, you're still calculating your life dependings on USD?

it's an inclusive statement. I have no doubt it should be "since centuries", for it has quite some impact on AI too.

Bigger blocks requires more resources to run the network. This is not a good idea if you want decentralization. 
Most people don't have &gt; 5 Mbps upload connection
Most people can't run full nodes demanding &gt; 500 Gig
Mining is near impossible right now for most people, this would be worse with BIP101.
Best thing for Bitcoin is keep the core this way for a few years. Core developers should concentrate on better solutions than BIP101, meanwhile they should encourage and help building layers/ side chains. 
This will help Bitcoin stay stable for a while, so the price can rise smoothly.
