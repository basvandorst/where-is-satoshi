Fuuuuck. So much for my self-editing. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:47:22
Thanks! Thought this place needed something to lighten the mood today.

Fixed, my bad. It's just hard out here for independent media producers, ya know?

The author doesn't "divorce" them. To me, what he's saying is that when people look at Bitcoin as a currency, they are missing the bigger (more impressive) picture. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:28:43
This represents about 50% of the conversations. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:36:36
Almost all demographic studies that have been done about Bitcoin show that the community is mostly men.

Edit: My bad for posting an address, thanks for checking this out!
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:32:30
I was surprised as well, did not think random girls on Tinder would know anything about Bitcoin. Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:53:50
I feel you, and I went back and forth on whether or not to blur the pictures but in the end I felt like the conversations were light-hearted enough to justify using the real pictures. And if I had blurred them it would've looked looked fake, imo.

Said I was nerdy and used some stock photos. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:23:23
It's a blatant rip-off of [this](
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:35:15
"Internet honor" was a joke. Again, if you think it is fake, try making that many Tinder profiles. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:32:17
Fair enough. You should go downvote as well.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:30:02
Thanks for appreciating the content. Some people are just gonna hate no matter what. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:30:25
QR code was a real looker.

Considering I have a girlfriend I didn't want to deal with friends in my area wondering why the hell I was on Tinder. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:14:36
You try creating 40 fake Tinder profiles.

GreenAddress is my go-to.

Thanks! Haven't made any Dogecoin in a while.
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:10:14
I'm a cynic as well but I'll put my internet honor on the line saying none of the answers were fabricated. Tinder is actually a difficult social network to game in terms of creating a fake account. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:12:31
Thanks for the tip! It was an interesting experiment to be a part of. Definitely did not think I'd get so many responses from matches that actually knew something about Bitcoin. It'd be great to see a girl go out and try the same thing with a profile of her own. 
And no to the following through haha, I've got a great girlfriend already who is patient enough to put up with my bitcoin rambling. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:31:35
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:28:43
I mean, tips are great if they are from people who enjoyed the content. This took a while to do. As far as the new account goes, I would rather remain anonymous for this article because I have a girlfriend (not married) and would rather not have people ask her why I was on Tinder. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:31:14
Bitcoin paranoid, price checker app.

Back during the last bear market I posted [this thread]( on Tinder matches that I quizzed about Bitcoin. My question was simple: "What are your thoughts on the Bitcoin digital currency system?" Wanted to share it again because I think it's an interesting look at how Bitcoin was perceived 4 years ago and how things have changed. Also, some of you should try this opening line **a)** Because I want to see new responses but I'm married now and not touching Tinder and **b)** At the time, it led to some pretty good conversations.
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:49:11
Fair enough, but I think you're looking through it from a modern perspective. The answers aren't incredibly insightful these days, but in 2015 it was a bit of a surprise to have people be receptive to these random conversations about Bitcoin. And I don't think many were looking at the MSM, there wasn't a ton of coverage at the time (this was deep in the bear market). The vibe I got was that the matches were genuinely interested. That was a surprise to me. When I went into it at the time I thought the answers were going to all be along the lines of "fuck shit I don't know about". End of the day, I think it shows that there may be more general public intrigue regarding Bitcoin than many of us think.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:34:14
Lol was wondering if anyone was still around from back then. Seems longer than 4 years ago...time flies in the Bitcoin world.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:33:19
If even one person in the future finds themselves a BTC sugar mama based on this question, I'll consider this whole thing a success.
