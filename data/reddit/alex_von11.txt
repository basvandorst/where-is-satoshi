It may not be distributed, but definitely decentralized

That is a savage answer for a funny but accurate comment

Prediction presupose the use of a mathematical model with some degree of complexity. You just draw sweet lines on a chart. That is what a 5yo can do.
This is more about anticipation than prediction.
Come to us with a decent rule-based, bayesian, or even indicators model, with statistics that back your “prediction”, and then you can claim it is a “prediction”.
As of now, you predicted nothing, you showed us your anticipation based on a imaginary pattern of your claiming something that is meaningless. 
Anticipation, not prediction.
Now stfu for real.

The only loser in this tread is you my friend. ��

It is not because you write with CAPS locked that your point become more relevant or less stupid. You predicted shit, you draw line on a chart. Call that prediction if you want but no one seems to agree with you. So whats the point now, what do you expect to win here ?
Now get over it kid and help yourself by stfu. You cant win em all. Accept your defeat, move on. Trust me, your ego will thank you.
@_date: 2019-08-16 00:02:22
No more Caps, there is an upgrade. But you are still in denial. Help yourself kiddo, stfu and apologise.

@_date: 2019-08-16 14:39:54

Top result from youtube are determined by the youtube algorithm.

@_date: 2019-10-08 22:44:50
Yes but you would be refered to this tuber if this is the kind of video youtube think you would like...
@_date: 2019-10-08 20:37:56
Lol I guess i was not clear.
An outsider will see his own very suggestion and those might have nothing to do with the one you share.
Is it absurd ? Who am I to judge.

Not sure to understand. Can you elaborate ?
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:08:53
There is no my side or your side lol, i only try to figure what would be more profitable for the growth of the community. Sorry if you feel like my point isnt worth giving some respect.

Pretty sure satoshi during the early days mine around 1 million bitcoin (google it). My 200 bitcoin was in fact an arbitrary number, you are right. That being said, i dont think the rest of my argument is bs bc of a technical misunderstanding from my person.
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:46:38
I dont even think he read it haha
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:46:03
Yeah i know, but around that time 1 btc wasnt worth as much as of today. Thats the main difference.
