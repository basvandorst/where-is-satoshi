Investors are watching news about ETF, and the government's most recent comments seemed negative. However, they weren't super negative and it sounds like there are some things that can be done to start ETF if guidelines are followed. There will be a delay for now on launching Bitcoin ETF.

the price of any asset is related to its ability to produce future benefits. Stocks are also traded based on their expected future value (e.g. Amazon has no profits yet, but its stock price is still rising because it is expected to create profits in the future)

We should talk about the correlation between the end of futures contracts and the dip and immediate rebound of bitcoin’s price. If these people intentionally caused a dip to short their first contracts and buy in low on their new contracts, then they are responsible for ordinary people losing millions of dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:01:24
Yea I agree it's recoveringg, but in the short-term there's usually a dip. Yesterday's bull run was even stronger and the price receded below 11k soon after crossing 12k

That adds to the discussion, although do you know if companies like coinbase wait to buy bitcoin for that time and then transfer it to you on the arrival date as soon as they buy it?

I want to see Satoshi come out of the woods and challenge Roger Ver to hand-to-hand combat. The way I see this going down is that Satoshi will contact Anonymous, which he will use as a platform to challenge Roger Ver while protecting his identity. He will say something to the effect of, "Roger, I set out to create a decentralized currency for the benefit of the human race, but you have appropriated my invention for your personal gain. I challenge you to a fight to the death in the Aomori Prefecture of Japan. If you wish to avoid this fight, your only option is to sell all of your BCash shares and give the proceeds to charity, followed with renouncing your support of BCash." After this, Roger Ver will be given 3 days to make his decision. If he does not concede, he will be abducted and brought to the battleground in Japan to fight with Satoshi for the soul of Bitcoin.

It will be a shitcoin, but it doesn't matter. The price is being dragged up to get the extra coins. I'm not sure if you heard, but we're also getting some of satoshi's bitcoin based on how much Bitcoin we hold. The result will be that people have more Bitcoin than they want to hold and plan to sell the extra (otherwise why wouldn't they already have that much more Bitcoin?)

Do you think that hourly employees would actually be content with being paid the next month? What world do you live in? People are screaming in your face and calling your manager to tell him how incompetent you are after 5 days if the system messes up and you can't pay them. In addition, if you are doing your payroll monthly and something goes wrong then you are not only breaking a contractual obligation to pay your employees, but you are also going to get huge fines from the state if they catch wind.
@_date: 2018-06-26 05:21:24
This Alaska-based small business that I have been working at in payroll for a couple of weeks should be the poster child for Bitcoin. I actually can't pay most of the employees in checks because they are constantly traveling because it's a shipping business. Those employees that I can pay with checks are often in remote areas in Alaska where it can take a week for the mail to arrive. Also, if you think that direct deposit is the obvious solution then you're right, but only for the normal payroll. If for some reason we need to pay an employee outside the normal payroll, then we have to manually push it through the bank using a template so that it can go through the clearing house process. To put it into perspective how bad this process is, after I entered an ACH payment in on Thursday it did not process the direct deposit until Monday morning because I missed the 5pm deadline.

The trend turned around on the daily with the continuation candle we just got on that big bearish engulfing candle. I personally think it’s going to bust through large volume levels until it runs into a level that has historically had strong volume at around 9.5k-9.2k.

Tether's business model doesn't seem bad to me. They make profits off of trading fees. After the massive run up of bitcoin recently, they must have made loads of money. I think that they certainly could have gotten enough banks to agree to lend them money seeing as they are so profitable. Why do so many people think that the money is fake?

@_date: 2018-03-08 22:10:48
What happens when news interferes with TA? Do traders consider the change as part of the wave pattern? Do they continue the same pattern at a lower price? Bitcoin seemed set to break the previous peak at 11.8k until FUD struck thrice yesterday, but now it's a different story.
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:48:45
I think it will have the opposite effect, because it will undermine the ability of governments to print money. If the UN, for example, had the ability to print their own fiat that was a universally accepted currency, they would surely have more resources and governments would actually take them seriously.

You can't see it on GDAX, but the 12 month MACD will be crossing the 26 month MACD from below. On March 7, the opposite happened when bitcoin started its dip to 8400. It also looks like Bitcoin could be getting out of a period where there was more selling than buying for the last 36 hours.

the news applies mainly to alts, especially ICO, since many of these behave like securities offered by companies. Bitcoin behaves much more like a commodity because it is decentralized. What's going to be affected are exchanges that trade bitcoin and alts together. The alt market has been bleeding for weeks because the SEC already stated its belief that these coins are securities.

@_date: 2018-02-03 01:02:17
I believe it benefits society that transaction amounts are visible to the public. I also would like to see the people undertaking transactions if it is possible. If i had to pick between the two, I would prefer it if the people transacting were revealed and the transaction amounts were hidden from everyone. I wouldn't be willing to invest in bitcoin if it was completely anonymous because the people who would benefit would be mostly criminals and corporations.

I sodled at 9200 and bought back in... at 9200 when it stopped looking like the end of bitcoin was a moment away
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:20:51
What I think is happening is traders are buying at bitcoin’s 200 mma, which is around 7600-7800, and then normies are buying over it because they think it’s going up. Traders also probably caused the dip to 7600, where they will buy again

I still dont understand how this applies to bitcoin. No company controls bitcoin. It's nothing like an ICO that was offered to get funding. I don't think Coinbase or Gemini would even be affected by this since their coins are commodities
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:58:28
If you start by looking at the recovery from 5800, then there were no significant dips until the price went all the way to 11800. We're finding where the price is going to rest, not actually dipping.
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:37:02


The peak this morning at 9800 was the highest the price has been since the dip on 3/8
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:03:41
If you haven't moved your coins to GDAX then I'd recommend doing that. It's free to move coins from coinbase to GDAX. GDAX allows you to trade limit orders for free as well. The benefit of Binance over GDAX is that the fees are lower for market orders, although limits orders are not free on Binance. Binance also has many more coins than Coinbase that you can trade using Bitcoin.

Hey man. What would Myths do after that dip at 10500?

There was a lot of buying at 9200-9500. I think whales were planning to let the price drop to 8500, but changed their minds when they saw that. Based on what I saw, the traders are still optimistic and the price is going to test 11k again soon.

I saw this post last night and thought it was so stupid that I didn't comment on it. The only difference between BCash now and when it was added to Coinbase is that BCash lost to Bitcoin. What else is different? Has BCash broken any rules that would not permit it to be put on GDAX?

I agree that he probably won’t but I think the market will be too cautious to go on a bull run until there’s more confirmation
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:23:51
Many years from now, when billions of people use Bitcoin every day to buy their coffee, people will be amazed that Bitcoin was once one of the most volatile investments. Supply and demand will be so perfectly balanced that the value of the US dollar will seem like a risky investment in comparison.

I bet the weak hands are going to buy back in at a higher price this time when it recovers. When it comes back up it’ll be pretty clear that it’s holding steady.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:17:36
the buy wall is scooting down
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:19:31
it's the best time so far this week if you think about it

I'm guessing 7800, which is around the 200 month moving average
@_date: 2018-03-05 06:36:16
How come the volume is the lowest I've seen since November on GDAX?
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:12:10
found the bottom...
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:43:57
I was wrong... This might be one of those times to sell and wait for the support
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:37:42
is it happening?
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:59:57
But you should know your coworkers' wages... Not knowing benefits the corporation, not you. There's laws that allow you to discuss your wages with your coworkers for that reason.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:14:42
I don't think splitting into many transactions would stop someone from figuring out what you are doing right now.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:52:18
The USD value of my alts is neither rising nor falling with Bitcoin's price. Is that because they've hit rock-bottom?
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:32:13
The most obvious dip ever after it failed to hit 12k tbh. I don't think it will go too much further down.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:49:24
Yea binance is still down. Idk how someone can expect big gains without the second biggest player trading at all.
@_date: 2018-03-10 03:08:31
If it breaks through, it moons. If it doesn't break through, it crashes...
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:46:40
probably traders who don't want to accidentally push the price up
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:55:13
Their charts are weak
@_date: 2018-04-12 04:57:36
wow no red whatsoever when I scroll through the trade history on gdax
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:53:52
Doing that thing where the price goes flat for a while and then goes very up or very down
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:35:18
I think TRON is going through a pump and dump honestly. The peak at the start of the month happened because of the testnet launch, and then everyone sold on that news. The recent pump is an echo of that, but there's not really anything coming up for TRON in the short-term that should justify the price increase, so I think it's going to fall back down to the 400's on binance. It could possibly slowly climb after that if it really starts to get adopted
@_date: 2018-04-01 02:31:49
doing that thing when it flatlines and either dips like crazy or moons
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:23:21
I sold at 7000 so this is a very exciting time for me as my potential bitcoin pile increases
@_date: 2018-04-20 07:43:12
tense moment. Will we make it past the 8380 from before the dip?
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:15:24
Maybe the price will double first, but Bitcoin will find a way to terrify you again when you least expect it.
@_date: 2018-04-29 23:30:23
Yes, yes. Undoubtedly. Certainly.
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:09:39
I recently reinvested in alts and they dgaf about bitcoin dips anymore apparently
@_date: 2018-04-20 07:55:52
That would be great. As long as the next wave stays above the temporary bottom at 8200 I think we're set.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:21:16
but if you pay someone for something using multiple wallets then I can see that on their wallet
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:27:29
the price was around 9200 yesterday morning. There were not enough people willing to risk buying when the price started to rise too much above 9000. I'm betting the market will need to test above 9000 a few more times before many people are willing to buy for that price or above. It's a good time to invest in alts imo since they will recover as bitcoin will probably fluctuate up and down within a range
@_date: 2018-04-07 08:22:35
oh nice I wasn't expecting this
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:26:23
I actually called this dip AND acted on it for once
@_date: 2018-04-11 06:21:12
I invested in alts a few days ago and maybe I picked good ones, but they're increasing in value by small amounts. I think bitcoin might do the same.
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:16:03
yea and yesterday
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:06:53
So I thought that the r/bitcoin april fools joke was real until now...
@_date: 2019-05-29 02:30:34
Sorry guys, I bought a little this morning. I moved it over to binance and put it into alts starting with the letters a-d, since that’s how far I got down on the list, so bitcoin should still be able to make it back to where it was this morning.
@_date: 2018-12-20 04:30:29
it's not a pump, just a bounce as sell volume fell and some buyers jumped in. keep in mind that as far as we know, we are still in a bear market. we haven't made any significant new highs for months, and there hasn't been volume to show a capitulation event.
