What if segwit made it just harder for whoever was spamming the mempool to spam it pushing fees and transactions through the roof which in turn kept the prices going up due to perceived use and demand. Ver and jihan were actually the good guys making everybody money and got flamed for it. Now that would be hilarious.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:14:38
So you’re saying it’s pegged to the usd? Weird coincidence huh? XD
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:01:55
This guy mines amirite?

Ah this is why I love bitcoin. Such great answers. Thanks for replying everybody. Even when i'm wrong I don't feel like an absolute dips*^%$(t here. Nice.

Try banning video games next! It’s probably killed more people than bitcoin so far.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:36:53
So how about crypto to crypto for 2017. Not a taxable event?
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:22:52
Click around in the ledger buttons. It will ask you to confirm the transaction. Should be the upper right button

Now we got a fire mixtape to blast with the top down on our bitcoin lambos

How does BTC differentiate itself with all these stories of BCH team lifting and crediting code changes while publicly calling them the worst development team ever. When you discredit BCH you discredit BTC because they're almost exact clones besides the block size. BTC doesn't have to die. BTC just has to keep improving and BCH has to keep stealing.

Raid Area 51 and buy bitcoin. They can’t stop all of us
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:54:58
Good. Next time you do the transaction look at the ledger right after you send the transaction. It should prompt you for confirmation.
@_date: 2019-07-04 04:18:18
Ask the real questions. Would you make more shorting the market or buying btc?
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:02:07
You sold. Congrats you're out. Live your moon and forever live in "what if" limbo. You didn't believe hard enough in the dream.

You just triggered a taxable event. You can believe in it all you want but if you have none you ain't in it buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:57:24
Are you saying some rich guy can literally come in and buy up all the existing bitcoin and then dump them to manipulate the currency to death. Isn't the point of the currency to keep single players from screwing with the entire economy? If you believe in the philosophy behind the tech. You'd hold because they can't do that. If you don't you sell.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:17:43
Question for sake of argument. What if you sent your bitcoin purchased in the United States to say Ireland and realized the gain there in an exchange. Can you affectively reproduce the tax minimization of google and Apple? Would the work?
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:26:14
It totally would. Public image is everything. An actual person is fallible and not all knowing. Imagine Harvey Weinstein was satoshi for arguments sake. The image would turn off x subset of people from using anything associated with it for a while. The origin myth must stand untouched like Jesus. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:54:30
Let’s imagine you controlled 40% of the hash. If you were spamming transactions with high fees but also mining the same blocks being transacted would you care about the high fees? Out one pocket into the other. Probably only one guy with this ability which is why core is warning us about centralizing power with the miners.

Hi Mark

My thoughts exactly. Enjoy the show. ��
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:36:55
Oh man I get it now! Bitcoin is exactly like the monkeys. Exactly like the monkeys......
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:45:21
Lol you just created a taxable event if you've been holding for a long time and switched to fiat temporarily. Please consult your accountant for damages.
@_date: 2018-08-26 04:22:25
Don’t they still have about $500 million in crypto? I’m not shedding any tears ya rich bastards.
@_date: 2018-08-26 07:14:05
It’s trustless meaning you walk around pretending everybody is a thief. If they assume you’re a thief and you DON’T take the money then you’re doing it wrong. 
Jk this is just a for fun answer

Fun thing is the 2017 rally was also sparked by some China news. In that case it was a ban. Then we went to 20k. I wonder what green lighting 5 billion people to buy crypto will do
@_date: 2019-06-03 00:50:22
Bitcoin is already millions and millions of dollars. Venezuelan dollars

Don't know exact numbers but ASIC antminer s9 the current best mining hardware runs at 1350 W per hour. Meaning 1 uses 1.35 kWh x 24 hours x 30 days. So on a monthly basis 973 kWh per machine. Last I check a panel generated 350 W. your acres would be completely covered with panels just to run a few at break even. Even if you got your pv panels free your real estate would be covered with stuff. Good luck plugging the rest into a calc.

Ah yes. The pcg of crypto. I don’t even give an F to pay respects.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:36:26
But can’t you choose to put no more than $20 on it and not expose your full wallet? are you concerned with people putting amounts they’re willing to lose put on the mainnet or is there some greater vulnerability im missing?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:45:55
Prediction BNSF chooses a smaller crypto to work with. Gets hacked for 25% of their worth. Switches back to bitcoin protocol. Plot twist WB never has to eat his words that bitcoin will fail because has passed 2 years before hack.
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:47:15
On the other hand if you dealt in USD it will only buy you .85 of another equally valued child today. Therefore buy bitcoin not children
