Vision impaired netizens would've used a Braille display. But since it doesn't imprint onto paper it's a lot more analogous to a screen than a telex.

Please explain how this makes sense?
If the value of BTC fluctuates, the cash previously received could exceed or be less than the current value of the BTC they have under deposit. Any FX trader has to hedge their position to prevent fluctuations from eroding the value of their portfolio of currencies. 
Much like any bank Gox may not keep unit for unit deposits mirroring it's depositors for this reason (hedging activity). In an immature system like the BTC world one can't expect a central bank or peer banks to assist a depository institution that has had a run ok deposits. 
Really, please explain it to me, I'd love to learn why you think I'm wrong.

Hahaha. Their poetry is better (shorter).

Thanks for the explanation. So this assumes all funds on deposit are held in their original currency. I wonder if that's the case. Certainly it would be the safe choice, but perhaps it's not what they did. This inspire speculation on my part.
Do you think the accusations of fraud being leveled against Gox have any basis? What's your reasoning?

I agree, this is more accurate.

Or cabbage patch dolls, really. Except bitcoin and it's successors will be so much more. I've been lurking in bitcoin for a long time and recently understood it has the ability to empower settlement beyond the established bankers' private clubs. I can't possibly explain it all here and now, but keep watching this space and decide for yourself. Just don't jump to conclusions, or you might be selling it short.

Sorry but what existing bank can withstand a withdrawal of all funds on deposit at once? I'll tell you, that bank doesn't exist. Gox is not a bank in the usual sense of the word, but due to fluctuations there is reasonably some expectation that not all funds can be withdrawn at once.

Stock ownership implies control. To the extent of your ownership, the company must listen to what you say (voting rights).
Bitcoin holders are more like stakeholders than shareholders, but shareholders are also stakeholders so the comparison is reasonable. 
FWIW there was a time when ownership of shares in a company, and separation of ownership and management, were every bit as radical as bitcoin is today.

Japanese regulators have very strict codes they enforce. There are rules for almost everything. Anything that doesn't have a rule yet is not interpreted, it's ignored. In this case crypto currency does not fall into their area of responsibility. If the public impact is too much, legislators will eventually take action. This all takes time. I can't really comment on the US regulations, I guess they are just more proactive about money laundering enforcement.
TLDR - J regulators do not"interpret" things outside their domain, they strictly apply regulations.

You can pay $200 per month for Cloudflare to install your SSL certificate in all their data centers. You're not paying specifically for this, it's just one feature of the business price tier.

That janky chain doesn't look at all robust. Might want to upgrade that before storing all your coins on there.
