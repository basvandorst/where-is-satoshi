Just so you know, this is the exact opposite of what all of was saying in 2013. Maybe you weren't around then though. You remember the bitcoin bowl? Remember everyone on the sub emailing companies asking them to accept bitcoin as a payment method? Remember when it was better than Western Union because the fees were way smaller, and we'd compare the market cap to that of Western Union? Remember the hype when Overstock began accepting BTC and we were all hoping that Amazon would be next?
Lotta morons on this sub back then. Rich morons now. But morons nonetheless.

Move them from coinbase to a blockchain.info wallet. You should be able to create a paper wallet easily in your blockchain account. It will give you the address to your coins and a key, like an ATM pin but longer, that you can use to put your coins back in your wallet again when you want to.

Yeah, I see the problem.  First of all, it's .999 silver, so I don't think China would sell them for just a couple bucks.  Secondly, nobody would buy them from China.  Third of all, I wouldn't suggest buying one from anyone BUT Casascius himself.  If you WERE to buy one from someone else, I'd make sure you have documentation that he/she bought it directly from Casascius...but I probably wouldn't buy one from anyone but Casascius anyway.

@_date: 2014-05-27 07:20:55
Yeah. Don't keep coins in coinbase but if you do, make sure you have 2FA on. When you move them to blockchain wallet, you can generate a private key for your address then print them both out and store them in a safety deposit box. There's gotta be tutorials somewhere. YouTube or something. Just never ever share your private key with anyone, and use very small amounts while you're practicing. Then when you're confident you can put a greater amount in cold storage, but I'd still suggest many cold wallets with small amounts than one with all your BTC on it.
@_date: 2014-06-25 05:49:35

Think about it this way. When you are deciding against buying a computer and waiting one more year, there's a guy who thought the same thing last year and is buying one today.

What if I have whatever backup file they send when you make the wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:43:08
No. I bought BTC at coinbase. Then I made a wallet on blockchain.info. That was 2 years ago. Now I log into blockchain.com and I can't find the BTC. I have the transaction hash and address I sent them to but can't figure out why they aren't showing up when I log into blockchain.info. So I'm hoping I moved them to another wallet but can't remember. And if I did, I was hoping I could use the address of the coins to see if they were in like GreenAddress or coinomi or whatever.

Built up like 10 at one point but lost most of them investing in AM1 and AM100. Anyone remember those? Fuck man I fucked myself.

Yes.  If you want bitcoin, buy now.  
If you want to make $ short term, then I agree with the other posts, we can't predict the future, especially with such a volatile market.
I bought about a week ago at $120 and watched it fall to $88 a couple days ago and I gave about .0001 fucks.  I'm buying bitcoin because I think it's the future. If you are trying to day trade with it....you're gonna have a bad time.

Not sure.  I really just use BTC-e to trade quickly.  I usually buy on Coinbase, transfer into BTC-e, and if I see a crash begin I sell immediately, then buy back in at the bottom and get more coins.  I'm in this for the long term success of it, but might as well short it if I can.  Of course shorting it doesn't always work...

We're already paying for it. The public benefits afforded to Walmart workers because they are paid so little are taken out of our taxes. So we're basically subsidizing Walmart. If they weren't paid so little, they wouldn't need food stamps and you'd be paying less taxes.

Just FYI, there have been group buys on Reddit already for these.  I got one from a group buy arranged by about a month ago.  [Link.](
Though, as a US citizen, I would have preferred a US buy, and am considering going in on this one as well, though it's only .1 btc cheaper than the UK buy.  But shit, .1 is .1 if you know what I mean!
Also, [I tried to personally arrange a group buy for the .5 btc .5 silver casascius coins,]( but there wasn't much interest.  I thought maybe people couldn't afford the .999 silvers but still wanted in.

You know what's funny is that I have a few friends who know I'm into bitcoin, but didn't care.  Then they heard about silk road going down and were like "you can buy drugs with bitcoin!??!"
Now they're checking those other two sites and want to learn how to buy drugs off of them with bitcoin and asking me how they should go about doing it anonymously. 
I guess it's possible that the fall of silk road hitting main stream media and the quick recovery of bitcoin was from people that want to buy drugs finding out that you CAN buy drugs online!
Like "holy shit, you can buy drugs online?  How can I buy some bitcoin!?!"

Some dude has been trying to scam me on localbitcoins for the last week.  He said he has a room credit on Expedia that he needs to use by Sept 1 or it expires.  He said he booked a room, cancelled it, then got the credit because he paid for travelers insurance.  So he said he'd sell me the $950 credit for $500.  Round and round we went, and eventually today I called Expedia.  Sure enough, the reservation was under my name, BUT since it was his travelers insurance, he could cancel the booking any time he wanted...and presumably sell it to the next sucker that came along.  Not sure if I should make a full post on this guy, or even leave his info, but I have his email address and phone number...

No. But that doesn't matter anyway, unless you're trying to sell it or buy one from someone besides OP. Someone would need to have your coin in hand to crack it. If someone has your coin, they can just peel the hologram and steal your key. If you buy it off eBay or even off OP, you risk someone else having the key even if the hologram is in tact, but I'd trust OP before random eBay guy. If you're planning on buying one and cracking the key without peeling the hologram, then selling it and keeping the key, then you're a dick.

I agree with you, somewhat.  It will depend on how btc is eventually used.  For example, the company I just read about on this sub that is going to act as a Western Union replica, only they'll take your USD, turn it to BTC, send it to GB, then transfer it to British pounds with a much smaller fee than WU charges now.  That will definitely be taxed.  
Person to person transfers with no business records or anything will likely be impossible to tax though, you are correct.  But then again, if I gave you $1 on the street for a cigarette, that wouldn't be taxed either, even though it is a "sale."

To play devil's advocate, I'm guessing he just copied and pasted that bill off of a website, and it's not an actual picture of one of his bills, so of course the address would be empty.  I bet if you searched for that exact bill you'd find it somewhere with the exact same address and private key as just an example somewhere.
If OP scanned the addresses on the bills when he met up with the dude and it showed btc on that address, I'd then check the private key right there, and if I got the btc, I'd give dude the $.  Just like on localbitcoins.  i would not, however, do this in any transaction besides face to face.

Coinbase doesn't cancel any orders based on the price of bitcoin. Not sure who's pushing that info.

that was in a few seconds when someone bought 25,000 or something. 
Also, to add my 2 bitcents, whenever it hits $100 I log into coinbase and buy.  
Depending on what kind of disposable income I have at that point, I'll buy 2 or 1 or .5 or .25, but regardless I'm buying at $100.  Not for any other reason than I think $100 is the floor for a while (sure it went to $90 for a minute) and as I've heard on TV, you're supposed to buy low and sell high.  Or buy low and put it into Asic Miner.

Nah, not really.  I've been following Sandstorm on bitcointalk since before he was selling shares and was just considering starting a company.  I could have got in then, but like I said, it really seems like it's just a kid short selling stocks.  He just wants to do it with more btc. 
It's like if I told you, "Give me 100 btc and I'll turn it into 100.1 btc by next week, then 100.2 by the following week" Just by short selling different stocks.  Maybe he's good at it but with the volatility of both bitcoin and the market, he definitely can't guarantee dividends because he's not mining or creating anything.  He's just like a fund manager.  He is up front about the moves he makes, which is respectable.  It's just like me or you saying "here, take my btc, invest it, buy low, sell high, give me the profits."  We could each do the same thing with our btc, but he's saying that he's better at it than we are, so he'll do it for us, basically, and take a cut. 
Of course this is just my understanding of it, I could be off base.

I can answer  and   
 No, bitcoins cannot be mined indefinitely. There will only ever be 21 million, and most likely less, as bitcoins can be and have been lost forever.
What you may have heard is that they're infinitely divisible.  This is true.  So while 21 million will ever be mined, you can split one up into .01, .001, .0001, etc.  Right now they only go to the "Satoshi" which I believe is .000000001 (8 zeros?  someone correct me if I'm wrong), but they can be further divisible if miners agree to that.
  A wallet printer is special because you print a wallet by yourself without any help and any chance of it being hacked.  There are wallet printers online, and while many are very secure, there is still a miniscule chance someone is watching what you do on your computer as long as you're online.  Problem is, that miniscule chance, if it happens to you, can cost you a lot of btc.  Printing wallets at home with no connection to the internet is the safest way of doing it, that's the only reason they're "so special."

You're okay.  Your BTC is still on your paper wallets. Here's what you want to do:
Open a blockchain.info account if you don't already have one.  If you do already have one, open it.
Go to your wallet and click on "import/export"
Enter the private key to one of the paper wallets where it says "import private key".
The full wallet amount should now be in your blockchain wallet.  
Send this btc to your new savings wallet.
Repeat with the other two wallets.
Let me know if this doesn't work.
In order to make paper wallets easy as possible, always cash in their full amount by importing their private key.  Then if you only want to spend .35 btc, do it from your wallet, then put the other .65 btc on a NEW paper wallet.  If you try to spend directly from a paper wallet, the change goes to another address and it can get confusing and you can lose coins due to that confusion.

Second of all, as far as I know, it's just some kid who is short selling different securities and making a little bit of btc doing so.  He just wants more btc so his profits are larger, and he'll give shareholders a piece of that.

Yes.  But you don't use them like credit cards or cash.  You peel the hologram, put the private key in blockchain.info, and blockchain spits out all the btc on the card into your online wallet, where you can then spend them.  Once the hologram is peeled the card is worthless.  These are just fancy cold storage.  Good for gifts though, as the users above have stated.

I see what you're saying, and I don't think btc owners should be able to circumvent taxes.  I can see how it came off like that when I started talking about where my taxes go, and it sort of comes off like that to me as well when I re-read it.  I think taxes should be paid, and one might call me a socialist (and I'm fine with that), because I think my taxes should go to certain "socialist" causes, like building roads and parks and funding national health care. 
But I hope that if bitcoin is heavily adopted it will cause a domino effect that starts at the end of printing 8 billion dollars a day for wars and the military...and eventually seeps into an effect on society that rearranges ALL of our priorities; and our elected officials will run and WIN on a platform of funding things like education and raising the minimum wage because society will slowly realize what's been going on for the past 20 years and I'm hoping bitcoin will both add to that notion and accelerate that realization...if any of this makes sense :-)
Edit: And I am FAR from fiscally conservative.  I actually wouldn't mind Bernanke printing all that USD IF it went to things like education and research.  It blows my mind that fiscal conservatives play the "passing our children a huge debt" when, if they are EDUCATED children, they will be able to cover that debt.  If we have the worst funded first world education system that is educating these kids, then even if we reduce the debt it won't matter because we won't be inventing/improving/innovating anything.  We'll be working for the people in other countries who had great educations because their countries FUNDED EDUCATION (and I'm not EVEN going to go into the cost of college/student loans nowadays...fucking ridiculous).
This shit parallels healthcare to me too.  Preventative treatment has been proven over and over again to save money.  Homeless and low-income Americans use the emergency room as their hospital.  They never go to regular checkups, nor can they get prescription drugs because they can't afford them (also not going to go into the fucked up the pharmaceutical industry is), so they wait til things get really bad and then hit the emergency room, which costs 10x what preventative care would cost (talking a free prescription filled once a month).  So they go to the emergency rooms because they provide "charity care" which is the hospitals charging patients on scale with their income.  So most of the emergency room care is free for the low-income patients (of which there are millions in the US) but 10x more expensive for the taxpayers who foot the medical bills.  And GOD HELP YOU if you make $25,000/yr+ and don't have health insurance.  If you make $0/yr your emergency room visit is free.  If you make $25,000, you don't qualify for charity care and your emergency room costs are full price.  So, appendectomy if you're poor: Free.  Appendectomy if you're not poor but on the edge of poverty: $25,000 (a year's salary...and I hope you don't get cancer, an appendectomy pales in comparison to the costs of cancer treatment).  Disclaimer: The aforementioned numbers are estimated and the ACA will remedy most of it, but we still should have gone the single payer route...
Hopefully that wasn't too much of a rant/tangent. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:51:00
Yeah the address is in plain view, and you could check it.  But the guy you're buying it from might have the private key written down somewhere, so unless you buy it and redeem it right away, you still have to trust that guy.  Mike USED to be that guy...the guy you could trust.  So basically you have to DIY, or your trusting someone else with your private key.

If you're using paper wallets as a spending currency, then you're stupid.  Same thing with Casascius coins.  If you're using them as currency, you're stupid.  So if someone can crack your Casascius coin, then it doesn't matter because they already have your god damn coin.

If he has proof it was delivered there should be no charge back. People scam bitcoins on eBay because there's no way to prove the person who paid you is the owner of the address you sent the bitcoins to. But if he has a tracking number that shows it was delivered then the situation is much different.
