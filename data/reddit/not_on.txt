@_date: 2018-01-30 12:27:21
no, just consider the white paper. you know, that thing you hate to refer to because it lodges an awkward spot of cognitive dissonance in the ol bean eh
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:54:11
what would you propose as the plural then?
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:39:12
It was done in August. You are seriously deluded if you think core are going to ever increase block size.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:32:28
guessing they didn't have btc already to open an LN channel
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:44:47
I should've had a /s there ;)
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:54:06
Are you suggesting btc is actually operating as a centralized chinese conspiracy? like that evil and corrupt bcash?
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:25:38
this is correct
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:22:23
There's more chance of earth getting another moon then core going for block increase now. you've backed the wrong horse, not too late to change...
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:45:13
you make it sound like segwit has been a dismal failure
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:26:18
This is what btc fans are missing completely... segwit has been here 4 months, nobody is interested in adopting it. And this is with the market at at pretty high desperation levels because of fees and tx delays - in other words, the pressure to adopt is there. LN needs to be *adopted* as well. It's not an upgrade that just works magic as soon as the upgrade is done, users have to get technical and fiddle about and given the ever less-technical nature of users entering the market, you might as well be asking users to compile an o/s.

what false advertising? that's it's cheap and fast? That's truth. it would be false advertising if bitcoin.org said that, but even they know better. there's plenty skill and tech behind bch, but keep telling yourself it's baaaaad by all means
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:22:33
yeah and it also doesn't lose funds randomly. what a piece of shit

Don't need to, just ignore it like the world did with segshit :)
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:53:03
exactly. he had no idea wtf he was doing
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:28:19
call it what you like pal, still taking btc down. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:11:40
That's like saying people only shit on good presidents, so that's why Trump gets so much hate - he's obviously a great president. 
LN is going to be the biggest fail crypto has seen since segshit, and some people in crypto are a bit tired of their party being pissed on by core's idiotic decisions and their tribe of mindless followers banging on about how awesome the naked emperor's clothes are.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:42:05
What if bitmain never decide they don't need it. like, they're in it to the end. What then?
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:18:51
you know this "spam" notion is a delusion right. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:47:30
This was a fucking moron thinking throwing $$$ into every ICO he came across made him a genius immediately, and a billionaire in the next couple hours/days. He wasn't trying to beat whales, he thought he was very clever spotting "the next btc", over and over and over.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:19:35
it's not spam, just paranoid delusions

god forbid it's just an objective member of the world of crypto actually pointing out facts
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:35:38
HAHA. next thing you'll be telling us to read the white paper for a reference on how btc is supposed to work
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:38:23
you mean he lost you
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:32:43
no, the genuine cases of people buying tether are to get out of btc or other crypto temporarily without going all the way back to fiat
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:40:30
yeah it sucks being conned by a product that works according to the spec paper that describes it. horrible feeling paying fuck all fees for fast txs. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:08:38
I didn't say value, I said use. But a good try all the same.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:37:12


seems like you typed gold instead of btc. since one literally does have use while the other literally has none.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:34:11


not cheap, not private. so you're pretty much out there selling bs.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:17:24


Very curious to see some evidence of links between bch and banks?
I do know Blockstream is funded by Axa, and Axa has direct links to the Bilderberg group. You heard of them? They dictate what banks do. So btc is clearly a bank-driven entity, I'd like to see your evidence that bch is also. It wouldn't surprise me if they both were.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:07:27
you cherry selected great numbers and applied some interesting mathemathics there (htf does 140 sat/byte * 223 bytes (simple tx) * 100000000 sat * $16000/BTC = $4.99 work). I would not expect any other result of your little demonstration. let's see if I can do it too. 
In the last 24 hours tx's of more than 1000 sat/byte were getting confirmed. Source:  So, at several points in the past 24 hours, 1000 sat/byte got our tx into the very next block. So we hope, anyway, could still take a day or who knows.
We'll use an average BTC price of $16,000 for easy math.
So: 1000 sat/byte * 223 bytes (simple tx) * 100000000 sat * $16000/BTC = $34.50
Now, I'm no expert on Fedex, but google-fu gets me this: "A USPS overnight flat rate envelope ships to “most places” for only $17.50 regardless of weight or distance. If you can fit it in the envelope, it's only $17.50. UPS and FedEx don't do that, so prices vary depending on what you're sending."
Your claim has been demonstrated inaccurate.

it's not very recent. I got ripped off like in april/may, it was already over $10 per tx, the writing was on the wall. now it's flashing giant neon. but I can see it's not enough for you. have you considered when it does become enough for you? is $50 per tx still ok? $100? $250?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:18:55
Maybe he just likes hearing the same message from different people. On reddit that would be an echo chamber, but on *twitter*.. it's news!

I can fedex you btc private keys cheaper and quicker (and with far more peace of mind) then a btc tx atm...

if you want to say depending on crypto, sure then it can all be true. but for btc? fot a nuck
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:06:43
First link describes BBVA investing in coinbase 3 years ago. You think they were planning BCH back then? How could they have known all of Blockstream's intents at that time, *and* known how the blocksize debate would go? Makes no sense. BBVA is a private Swiss bank, hardly the candidate I'd expect to be manipulating crypto. I'd expect US or Chinese banks having fingerprints all over the show - if this bch=banks theory has any credence.
Second link is clearly biased towards btc and doesn't answer my question at all. 
Looking for objective evidence that banks/govts are driving bch.

let's not kid ourselves, most non-tech crypto users quite likely WILL get the shit hacked out them. even "clued up" users...
