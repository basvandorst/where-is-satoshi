So close.  Legal tender means that a court can force you to accept whatever currency is legal tender in that jurisdiction as satisfaction of the debt, even if the original obligation was denominated in another currency.  You can settle your debts out of court however you please.

That would be great if they didn't explicitly claim that they were in fact compliant with the laws of Panama.

Why do you doubt that?  They purport to represent an interest in an ongoing concern, how is that not a security?  


How is that relevant?  Unless you think bitcoin doesn't fit within the confines of "anything of value", the fact that it's what's traded for the security rather than fiat currency or anything else is irrelevant.

That seems unlikely, as Panama takes the "anything of value" stance in trades for securities.  Unless bitcoins are considered valueless, I don't see anything grey about it.  I could see it being something regulators don't care about though.
Case in point, the Ponzi scheme in Texas, they didn't care until it fell apart, and even then, criminal charges were never filed, only civil.

Havelock claims to comply with those regulations though, if they don't, would you agree that's a concern?  That's tantamount to fraud.
@_date: 2014-03-06 01:28:49
There's a darknet service that acts as a bitcoin brokerage, and I have no problem with them, because they make it explicit that this is almost certainly illegal.  My problem is Havelock holds itself out to be compliant, and so I was wondering if anyone had looked into it in depth.  If they haven't, I plan to, if for no reason than curiosity.

A year ago, a single services, Satoshi Dice, nearly took down the network.  It's dev team openly admits it is not yet structured well for significant transaction volume.

As a lawyer, it warms my heart to see such quick responses to common legal myths.
@_date: 2014-01-29 05:51:54
Your point is fair, you can't settle it out of court however *you* please, you can only settle it out of court however you and your counter-party agree to.  If your pleasure is not agreed upon by your counter-party, and is not in legal tender in full satisfaction of the obligation, you cannot settle it. 
The integrity of original obligations settled in another currency are maintained in two ways, state equity jurisdiction and fair market value adjustments.  If you have a futures contract requiring you to deliver 100 BTC for $100,000 on x date, if x date comes and you have 100 BTC and your counterparty tenders $100,000 but you fail to deliver, the state can use its equity jurisdiction to require you deliver that 100 BTC.  
In addition, in that same scenario, if you failed to deliver that 100 BTC when I tender my $100,000 on that date, lets say I sue you for contractual violations.  And lets say on that date the highest bid on Mt. Gox for 1 BTC was $1,300.  Contract law and fair market value analysis would let me recover $30,000 from you, granted that would be payable in the legal tender, USD.

My question is specifically about the laws of Panama.  You're making public offers of unregistered securities, which by default does not fall under any of the exemptions to the general registration requirement for securities.  Even if these offers were not made to the public, as investments are open to more than 50 people, it does not qualify for the private investment exemption that you're claiming.  I get it, Panama's regulators have bigger fish to fry than you, but why not make it clear that you're not in compliance?  Why mislead people?

"Potentially illegal" usually means it's an unsettled area of law.  For instance, it's potentially illegal to "Facebook hack" someone, because under a broad and unsettled reading of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, that would be unauthorized access to a computer system.  Here, it's only "potentially illegal" in the sense that any action is "potentially illegal" because it could be banned or criminalized in the future, which isn't a very useful sense of the phrase, and isn't its common understanding unless context made it clear.  But of course, making things clear isn't as sensationalist.
Donating bitcoin or sending a bank transfer to the Wau Holland Foundation with a notation of "Snowden" is no more illegal today than it was a month ago.  Now, any effort to get people to understand the genuine problems with current interpretations of IEEPA's sanctions regime, particularly as they are applied to US citizens, will require erasing the inaccuracies put into their minds by @_date: 2015-04-02 15:03:26
Sort-of.  What they're trying to do is make it easier to narrow the universe of tools like Tor, and one of the best ways to do that is to profile those that download it from the clearnet.  The Tor universe right now is a little over 2-million end-user clients.  If you find a footprint from someone using Tor that tells you they're using TAILS v 1.3.1, you can narrow the universe of Tor client connections that might contain your suspect significantly.  It's not that they're labeling you as anything or paying special attention to you, they just want to create as many profiles as possible in relevant categories to make future attacks on Tor anonymity with regard to a specific target easier.  
In other words, there's no real reason for TAILS users to be particularly concerned about being watched by the NSA, the NSA is watching everyone, and everyone should be concerned about that.

Someone would come knocking at your door because wiring money requires knowing the counterparty's banking information, and so the FBI would want to talk to you about how you got a known fugitive's banking information.  That was just as true a month ago.  Misinforming people about things because "hey, it gets people to support my position" is terrible, and not really something Snowden seems like he would support.  He's someone whose extremely careful with everything he says, making sure it's honest and truthful and clear.  He doesn't even do common truth-fudging things like saying "I didn't commit a crime" when what he means is "what I did shouldn't be a crime."  Lying and fudging is exactly what the guy is fighting against, he's said repeatedly that the spying, while he disagreed with it, wasn't what made him decide to become a whistleblower, it was watching administration officials lie about the spying that he felt was unacceptable.

You're not.  You're referring to this section:


This section only applies to blocked persons who are physically present in the territory of the United States, and it doesn't say you don't have to be put on the list, it says you don't have to be given prior notice before being put on the list.  It's beyond me how anybody reasonably reads "there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination" and thinks it means "there need be no listing".  The listing comes from being affirmatively designated as a blocked person by the Secretary of Treasury or his designee, in this case, that's OFAC.  
This is a list created with zero due process, and that's a huge problem, it's always been a problem with the sanctions imposed under IEEPA, but you still have to be formally designated as on the list in order for the prohibitions of the IEEPA to apply.

I'm still waiting for you to continue fumbling through an ignorant defense of your assertions about the effect of yesterday's executive order.  
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:40:42
Here's an FAQ from Treasury on this EO for you: 
Since it's clear you can't understand the more technical language used in the order (I know, it's tough not to realize "prior" means "before", and that in order for someone to be something as "determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State", Treasury actually has to say they've made the determination.  This requirement comes from the APA, which I guess you wouldn't know if you're not a lawyer that deals with federal agencies, but that's probably why you shouldn't make assertions about things where you don't understand significant parts of it.  
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:37:51
You would trust my statement about that, but you don't trust the agency directed to act on this Executive Order to understand the order they're implementing?  All because you don't understand that a list that goes up concurrent with designation is not "prior notice"?  
Get a dictionary.
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:07:52
What the fuck is wrong with you?  I'm telling you that this EO doesn't make US citizens transacting with any particular person illegal until that person is specifically designated as falling under it by Treasury and put on the SDN list maintained by OFAC.  What it does is expand the criteria Treasury is allowed to use to designate someone as a blocked person, which it does by adding them to the SDN list.  
Your original statement isn't wrong because I politically disagree with you, it's wrong because it's wrong.  No matter how much you attack me personally, or how many times you try to argue "designate" and "prior" are meaningless terms in the order, or how much you continue to spew ignorant bullshit about an order, promulgated under laws you've never read and subject to regulations you probably didn't even know existed, you will still be wrong.  
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:28:38
your post is simply, unequivocally wrong.  This order does nothing more than expand the criteria of individuals eligible for OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals &amp; Blocked Persons, the Department of Treasury has to actually add someone to the list before they become a "blocked person", something they have not done with Snowden.  This also likely wouldn't even authorize treasury to add him to the list, as he hasn't done any of the cited activities from outside the United States, he was on US territory when he stole documents from the NSA.
This is just ignorant fear-mongering.
Edit:  Downvote me all you want, you can search the list:   *He aint on it*.
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:02:38
What?   That doesn't make any sense.   Here, you're saying Treasury's powers under the EO are larger than what Treasury thinks they are, are you trying to imply that the PATRIOT act was read by agencies to give them less power than it actually did?  
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:43:22
The link is talking about the order from yesterday, fucking read it before commenting.


The order doesn't say that anywhere, it says:


That doesn't say "there need be no listing or designation", it says "there need be no prior notice of a listing or designation."  In other words, they don't have to tell you before they put you on the list, they can just put you there.  That's very different from saying they don't have to put you there, and can still do all of that stuff.  Your reading of it is insanely idiotic.

And you call me a troll?
As I said:


Are you asserting that the INA is the source for the financial controls?  Is the IEEPA supposed to be the source for the border controls cited in the order?  What the hell are you trying to claim here?
Then you cite the provision that says there need be no **prior notice** of a listing or determination, and assert that means there need be no listing.  Do you know what prior notice means?
Better yet, do you know what the IEEPA is?  The NEA?  INA?  Have you ever looked at any of these statutes even once in your life, much less their implementing regulations in the CFR?
And yet you speak about them as if you're an authority, as if you deal with them on a daily basis, like I do.  And you have the gall to call me a troll.  
@_date: 2015-04-02 22:10:52
They're not wrong about everything, they're right about there being no due process when it comes to designation under IEEPA.

OFAC is the Office of Foreign Asset Control, they are the office within the Department of Treasury that manages the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.  
It states that IEEPA is the governing statute with regard to the financial controls at the beginning of the order, as well as at several points throughout.  I don't know how you can read 


And still not understand that you have to actually be named as a person first.

@_date: 2015-04-02 21:39:33
