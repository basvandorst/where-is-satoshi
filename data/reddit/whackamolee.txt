Bitcoin's scaling problems were built in. They were predictable at the beginning. The eventual market winner will be a crypto designed to scale well.
It's disingenuous to say, "Oh once we scaled up the network we saw all these scaling problems." You could have read Satoshi's paper and seen the scaling problems. All blockchain-based ledgers have scaling problems and those problems need to be solved at the protocol level.

There are two theories about Coinbase.
1) They are really nice, honest people who are simply overwhelmed by the load. That's why they can't even bother to hire support staff, verify your ID, accept your fiat transfers in, or process your fiat transfers out. Nice people, honest as the day is long. See that nice man Brian on tv. 
2) They're seriously undercapitalized and using current inflows to pay cash redemptions. That's why it takes a week and a half to move money in, and 3 or 4 weeks to move money out. The legal definition of a Ponzi scheme.
We'll only know which is true once the lawsuits start. For my part, I have now made a firm decision not to trust any exchange with serious sums of money. The crypto space is a giant fraud waiting to crash. A lot of people are going to be hurt. My personal opinion. 
I do believe in blockchain technologies. I do not trust the current generation of exchanges.

"Buy the rumor, sell the news," is a standard piece of wisdom in the stock market. It means that, say you have some drug company that's rumored to be developing some life-saving drug. The stock moves up and up and up for months on the rumor. Then one day they make the announcement. You would think that would make the stock go up, but *the news has already been priced in*. The stock's been going up for months on the rumor. Now that the rumor has become news, it's not time to buy. It's time to sell. All the good news was already priced in.

Corporations are efficient. Your product has a scaling problem. A couple of proposals get passed around, emails go back and forth, there's a meeting, consensus is arrived at, a decision is made, and everyone aligns to implement the solution.
Now compare with the bitcoin core developers, who can't and won't get themselves organized to address their technical problems. So now people are talking about side chains. What if TCP/IP were slow and clunky so people invented "Lightning Internet?" Makes no sense, right? If the underlying protocol doesn't scale, you have to fix the scaling problems, not invent sidechains.

Market cap can be a little confusing. Say for sake of round numbers that there are 10M bitcoins that have been mined but none have ever been bought or sold for fiat.
Now one day somebody buys a bitcoin from a miner for $20k USD. Now the "market cap" of bitcoin is 10M x $20k = $200 billion. 
But there is only $20k of fiat in the system! That $200B number is just a conceptual multiplication that bears no relationship to anything at all. One person did one transaction and you magically impute that value to all the existing inventory. 
Not sure if that's what you were trying to say, but it's important to realize that the market cap does NOT represent the amount of fiat in the crypto space. The market cap is the last transaction times the number of things that are for sale, whether it's stocks or cryptos or houses or cars as you mention. In a thinly traded market (which bitcoin  actually is), market cap is an extremely misleading statistic.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:19:21
Well that's not true either, since many stocks don't have a dividend. Growth stocks whose management pours the profits back into the company don't typically have a dividend.
Amazon does't pay a dividend. You wouldn't say that stock has no value.

One theory is that bitcoin attracts the same segment of anti-fiat investors that gold does, so that the interest in cryptos is suppressing the price of gold.
Another theory is that people who made a lot of money in bitcoin will become interested in holding something tangible and will start buying gold.
And another theory is that once everyone realizes bitcoin is a bubble, it will crash and all that money will go into gold.
I have no idea what's true. There are all kinds of opinions out there.

Tax hint: Put your quarterlies aside before they're due. If you expect to owe the IRS money but you spend that money instead, the IRS may not be as understanding as you'd wish.
That said, no you will not go to jail. The IRS is actually one of the best organizations in the world to owe money to. They'll set you up on a nice low-interest payment plan. I'm totally serious. The IRS is actually very nice. Compared to, for example, the California Franchise Tax Board, which garnishes your wages first and asks questions later.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:40:27
Great questions. Herewith my opinionated opinions, speaking for nobody but myself.


Technically no. A Ponzi scheme is when investment returns are paid out of the deposits of new investors. Clearly that's not happening.
HOWEVER! Here is what DOES look Ponzi-ish. I am in the middle of trying to transfer USD to GDAX. My bank has debited my checking account a week ago. But GDAX still has my deposit marked "pending." One explanation is that they're simply overwhelmed with volume. But another possibility is that they are undercapitalized and using my deposit to pay off people moving their USD balance back to their bank accounts. If that were the case (not saying it is) then THAT would be a Ponzi.


Sort of, in the sense that early investors (who paid a few bucks per BTC) are the ones making money, and the later investors will be left holding the the bag. Or hodling the bag as it were. Too early to say if this is the case.


What, just because the top three Chinese miners control over 50% of the hashing power? Yup. "Decentralization" has totally failed. Nobody seems bothered by this but they should be. [Check this out]( and be afraid. Be very afraid.


No. There was no new world-changing technology behind tulips. This is much more like the IPO of Netscape in 1995. That was when the world realized that there was a lot of money in this new Internet thing. Likewise there were investment bubbles around railroads and radio, two other tranformative technologies of their times.


Yes. But that's no objection, since dollars are fake and imaginary too. When the public loses confidence in the local currency, you get wild inflations such as Germany in the 1920's (you know what happened after that), Zimbabwe in the 1990's, and Venezuela right this very moment. And for that matter the US dollar experienced tremendous inflation in the 1980's, and some people are predicting the USD could be vulnerable to hyperinflation in the future if the Fed's money printing blows up. 
All symbolic money is an abstract confidence game. When the public loses confidence, it's all over. In that respect bitcoin is no better or worse than dollars.
However, the USD is backed by the taxing authority and military power of the US government. Bitcoin is backed by what, exactly? Three big mining pools in China and a few cranky core developers? You tell me. I don't know.


Absolutely true. Nor does the dollar hold any intrinsic value beyond the heat it would give off if you set fire to it. 


If everyone HODLs, nobody spends it. Since the value of bitcoin keeps going up, why should anyone spend it. Why buy a Lambo today when you can buy two tomorrow.
On the other hand if it stops going up, the speculators will get out and the price will crash. 
So no, it's not a currency. In that respect Satoshi's vision has failed. With transaction settlement times in days and fees in the $20 USD range, it's definitely not a currency. 


Well there's no army or taxing power behind it, that's a fact. But dollars are just pieces of paper. Dollars are worthless too. And for that matter the dollar has lost well over 90% of its value since the creation of the Fed in 1913. 
So again, bitcoin is inherently worthless but so is every other abstract form of money. Even gold is really not worth anything. The jewelry and electronics argument doesn't make gold worth $1380 an ounce. Money is always a confidence game. It has value because everyone believes it has value. When they stop believing ... Zimbabwe here we come.


I vote yes, but clearly that's a minority opinion on I think bitcoin has serious scaling problems, serious miner centralization problems, and worst of all, serious governance problems. The core developers refuse to deal with the technical problems. Some other altcoin will eat bitcoin's lunch.
And perhaps currency isn't the killer app for cryptos. After all we have smart contracts, supply chain management, and all the many other potential applications of blockchain. Money is the only application where you're going directly against the governments of the world. Most likely blockchains will change the world, but perhaps not necessarily in the realm of money. 


No, same as tulips. There's a genuine world-changing technological revolution in blockchain coming after the bitcoin price action hysteria dies down.


No, blockchain will be huge. Really huge. Bigger than the Internet. But bitcoin itself? It may well be remembered like the Netscape IPO. The investment mania that drew the world's attention to a new transformative technology but eventually became nothing more than a footnote to the revolution it sparked.

As of this moment the top three Chinese miners control more than half the hashing power of the network. Decentralization has already failed. Nobody seems to be bothered by this.

I have a thought. If you have a communication protocol that is so slow and clunky that you need an auxiliary protocol to make it work, your fundamental design is wrong. 
Lightning inverts the concept of protocol layering. In TCP/IP you have IP at the lowest level. It's fast and dumb. It's basically a "from" address, a "to" address, and some unspecified data. No guarantee of delivery, no actual useful functionality.
Now you layer on top of that TCP, which is going to be slower, but it gives you reliable connections. Then on top of that you have actual applications: Web, email, VOIP, blockchain, etc.
Now with Lightning, you have the slow and clunky layer on the bottom, with the faster and more nimble layer above. That makes no sense. Adding another layer can not possibly increase the net throughput of the system. The entire concept is backwards.
There seems to me to be something fundamentally wrong with the concept of layering a "faster" network on top of a slow one. If Lightning is secure, why not extend it to just replace the underlying blockchain?
Somebody please put this in context for me, I'd be grateful. As an old TCP/IP guy I see the Lightning concept as an inversion of why we layer protocols in the first place.

Just curious how people use Binance. Since they don't take fiat you have to buy coins using ETH or LTC. Do people buy ETH elsewhere, move it to Binance, and buy their target coin immediately? Otherwise you'd be subject to the price swings in ETH or LTC. This whole system seems very clunky. How do people work with this system?
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:07:42
If decentralization is important, what do you make of the fact that the top three Chinese miners (or four, depending on when you check) already control over 50% of the hashing power on the bitcoin network? Isn't that a concern, and a clear failure of the "one cpu, one vote" vision of Satoshi?

Interesting to see what will happen after the segwit2x fork (which turns out to be very different than the original segwit2x) happening in about 24 hours. 
In some ways, cryptos are inflationary. Every fork makes more tokens and further splits the pool of value.

Infinity. You can't solve fundamental problems in a protocol with a side network. Imagine if there was a slow and clunky Internet along with a side Internet. What kind of sense would that make?
If btc were an experiment in a research lab they'd say, "Great proof of concept," shut it down, and get to work on the redesign. 
My opinion, YMMV.

No that's not true. A share of a company gives you part ownership of that company. You have a legal right to vote for the board of directors and to have a share of the company's future earnings.

Depends on whether Satoshi turns out to be the NSA or not. Two datapoints:
* The NSA published a paper on electronic cash in 1996; and
* The NSA developed SHA-256. What are the odds the NSA would release a crypto algorithm it hadn't already broken or backdoored?
On the other hand if Satoshi turns out to be just some clever cryptographer, it wouldn't affect anything at all.

This vision has already failed utterly. The top three Chinese miners already control over 50% of the hashing power. The exchanges, many of which are outright frauds, can and are manipulating the market. 96% of the bitcoin are owned by 3% of the wallet addresses.
There's no democracy, Satoshi's idea of "one cpu, one vote" has failed, the market's manipulated by the whales, the miners, and the exchanges, and the public is going to figure all this out at some point.
