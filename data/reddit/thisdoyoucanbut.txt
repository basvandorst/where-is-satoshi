It's a bit of fun dude.  You're reading waaay too much into it.  It's a good clip from the movie.  I changed the words to make it funny and into a bitcoin meme.
That's it.

Nah, just a side order of garlic bread please.
@_date: 2018-05-16 18:31:29
It's still up there to this day
@_date: 2018-05-16 18:24:28
Glad you liked it
@_date: 2018-05-16 18:24:13
Make mine a pepperoni please
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:11:00
seems increasing more likely
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:15:56
You're right, it needs more drama at the end.  The next meme will be better
@_date: 2018-05-16 18:23:14
Damn it!

@_date: 2018-05-16 18:32:42
I spelt 'million' wrong and forgot a 'to' too.  Hard work all this spelling lark

@_date: 2018-05-16 18:33:49
Pineapple floats Walter Whites boat.  It's better than meth on pizza I suppose.  But then again...
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:55:03
keeping with the spirit, good on you!
@_date: 2018-05-16 18:33:03
You're God damn right!
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:16:42
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:17:23
I'll use it the best I can
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:04:28
I've sold too many BTCs in my time.

You had to go and remind me how long I will have to wait for my moon lambo.  Now I'm sad.
@_date: 2018-05-16 18:23:48
I just bought premiere 2017 and I thought I would give it a go.  So I made this
@_date: 2018-08-14 09:15:49
He gets a movie made from his story and Leo DiCaprio plays him.  That's not a bad ending in my opinion
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:14:09
*wipes away tear*
@_date: 2018-05-17 08:16:51
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:16:59
You see people, this guy gets it!
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:16:20
That's the spirit!
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:01:24
The last thing we need is for them to get together and them to say that we made memes about thems
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:14:00
Adobe Premiere
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:57:54
That was my plan dude... So everyone can accumulate more.
Quick hand over your fiat, I may never give you this opportunity again! 
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:16:03
There is some room for improvement to be had I think
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:16:56
Thanks for stealing my meme!
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:04:19
Because fiat was NEVER used by unsavoury people to buy drugs in the whole history of fiat.
Man don't you remember the days before Bitcoin when nobody bought any drugs EVER!?
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:15:21
I've put all my money into quality Bitcoin memes and Dogecoin.  
Here's to the future!

Happy cake day
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:20:40
Now that sounds like a project I could get behind.
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:20:55
I'm looking for evidence Sherlock
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:07:59
Too true
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:14:34
I try my best
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:02:25
I think Leo is just making sure we only have original content on r/bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:44:47
Who doesn't love a well placed rollercoaster meme?
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:15:46
This guy is so woke!
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:19:51
Damn, better get me some hot Pepe coin
@_date: 2018-07-03 08:23:01
I feel like it's the Zeno's race paradox for me. I'll buy $100 when I can but I will never quite reach 1 btc.
@_date: 2018-07-03 08:26:34
My time to shine Bitches!
