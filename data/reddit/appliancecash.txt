What legal economy? The gambling? The unlicensed "stock exchanges"? They are not selling enough hemp oil bath soaps to outweight the massive amounts of "illegal" transactions that are taking place.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:11:13
Ha, how much does that pay at the current rates listed?
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:03:04
Is this real life?
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:06:19
So you do all of this and are in compliant with all other regulations worldwide?
I am honestly interested in finding a legit company to use for these purposes but seems very far fetched.
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:06:42
What happened to blockchain now? 
Edit: It's probably not the fact that amateurs run these as much as it's nearly impossible to do any of this stuff legally.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:22:07
All of the idealistic words in the world won't change how risky this is for everyone. If this exchange was "stopped" it's probably not because it's dealing in BTC (at this point) it's because money transmitters (or whatever they are called) are nearly impossible to run legally unless you have a very good lawyer, lots of money and lots of time.

I'd trust my money in a poker site before any of the exchanges.

They do enough volume that their bank told them for absolute sure why they were closing the account. Maybe it was chargebacks, legal issues or whatever but they know. I've seen several companies that dealt with ewallets and holding large sums of money lose their bank accounts over the years thanks to poker, porn and everything else and they all knew exactly what went wrong.
A few things hint to something overwhelming. It's a successful business, if it were legit legally they would just get another bank account or sell to someone that could handle it. Something is causing them major problems to just close the doors.

The government has seized domains of sites selling $50 in counterfeit goods per year. It's more likely that the bank figured out what they are doing and didn't want to do business with a money transfer business that is very likely illegal. I forget the word they call these businesses but I've read the laws long ago. There are dozens of rules and regulations to transfer money between currencies as a business and it's a very hard area to get into legally even if Bitcoins were deemed AOK.
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:22:33
Not individuals, businesses that do large volumes. BitFloor knows exactly why they are having their account pulled.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:39:15
Well that plus laws.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:36:08
More like "This shit is illegal and we want no part of it."
Not trying to poop on anyone's parade but the banks will give the exact reason that any sizable account is being closed and it's usually a good one.
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:58:00
No, I meant that I love how they just pass whatever and everything is a gray area until they provide guidance on it years later. Just reading it myself I would say that your company is probably A-OK based on my understanding of how it's written, it's just a pretty crappy way to enforce laws and a good reason we don't need so darn many of them that nobody can keep up.
I've run into similar issues with phone rooms, money services, rent to own merchandise and a few other things over the years. Grrrrr

That is completely ridiculous, I just don't go all idealistic on things because I like them. There are some serious hurdles blocking the way and nobody has successfully avoided them for long in the past. To pretend that Bitcoin isn't a haven for things that are illegal and difficult to do with USD is ridiculous. Even things you are counting in your "legal economy" are almost certainly illegal in the USA and many other parts of the world. If they aren't you can bet good money that they will be soon enough.
Did you really think everyone is going to sit back while gambling and drugs are being traded right on websites that every governing body can view? Do you think you can just decide to open an exchange and let people trade a new currency like a stock? There are a plethora of laws covering this stuff that are already on the books and I think a lot of people here just turn a blind eye to it because they want this to succeed so bad.
I am not personally against Bitcoin, I am actually glad to have a semi easy way to get money to and from a poker account again but I'm not stupid and I know that this is only a minor obstacle compared to what's coming.
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:49:37
Except there are similar laws in most civilized countries. Not only will they try to block users from being able to get money into the system they will actually start seizing money if they see bitcoin as a legitimate threat. Instead of "we are ceasing operations, your money is safe" you will start seeing a big FBI or similar page and millions of dollars taken by the government. If you think people will keep trading cash for ones and zeros when it can be taken from them at any time you are wrong. 
Sure, if you keep it in your wallet they can't really do anything, except make it so that should you ever spend it you run the risk of losing whatever you spent. If your goal is an underground currency that requires person to person meetings for transfers then awesome. If that is the case though, why the drive to get businesses to accept this form of payment? It won't do them a lot of good when their entire accounts are seized because they ignored laws and took this money after being told to stop.
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:00:34
There are similar regulations all over. I have no idea if there are in the UK specifically but seems likely.
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:28:20
 
I finally dug up part of the laws I'd read in the past regarding this. If you look at the top part and the suspicious activities section you'll see why it's hard to do this stuff legally, **especially** with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:06:33
It matters in the short term. You will never make it to the long term without it, not in the way people are hoping for around here.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:09:49
Are you licensed in all 50 states and every municipality where you do business or are you another person that figured "Hey, I can buy and sell these and take a cut!" without looking into everything?
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:10:36
Operate legally.
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:06:02
Regardless of why one likes bitcoin the fact remains that you must be able to use it for it to be viable. They can make the barriers to using it insurmountable if they want.
@_date: 2013-04-19 13:01:58
Ah, the good old "Pass one thing then offer guidance on it later" trick. Thanks for the links.
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:30:49
The concept / idea is irrelevant when it can be shut down at the whim of a small group of idiotic legislators. It doesn't matter how sound the currency is but for the record that's "not very" at this moment.
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:56:42
Last time I spoke with a lawyer regarding this I was told that exchange is covered under MSB's.


money orders
traveler’s checks
check cashing
**currency dealing or exchange**
Is that not the case? I just don't want to make a deposit and have it vanish one day.
Edit: 
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:21:36
Several people have seen me post that a lot of this bitcoin activity is almost certainly illegal under US law and people have said I have an axe to grind.
I don't. I think the concept is awesome but I've looked into similar businesses as the ones required to let bitcoin operate over the years and I just don't see it being viable unless a very large and legit company gets involved. Unfortunately, the requirements pretty much go against everything users here seem to think bitcoin stands for but OK.
If you look at just how in depth this stuff is you will be able to point to just about every major bitcoin service as doing something that can cause them trouble... like closed bank accounts.
Read into it whatever you'd like, just posting the info for those interested.
