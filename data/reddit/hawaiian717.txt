It's also that the chips can't be cloned, but the magnetic stripe on a chip card still can. So moving to chip cards accomplishes nothing if lots of merchants still swipe. So by shifting the liability to the merchants if they swipe, they encourage the merchants to upgrade to chip readers.

The chip stops card cloning fraud. As far as liability goes, the merchant is now held liable for fraud if they swipe a card and the bank had issued a chip card.

I might be imagining things, but I think a previous generation of Target credit card terminals did have you insert the card to have it read the magnetic stripe, rather than swipe. But I haven't seen one of those in a while, they've been replaced with Verifone VX925 terminals which feature a chip slot on the bottom and a place to swipe the magnetic stripe along the side.

Credit/debit cards with chip. New in the US but been around for years in other countries. You might have heard it called "Chip and PIN" even though few US issuers are actually doing Chip and PIN; instead the US is mostly getting Chip and Signature, for now anyway.

It's not even that. The old terminals without the card reader are easy. There's nowhere to insert, so just swipe. The problem is many places have the new terminals, but don't have the chip reader enabled, so inserting the card does nothing and you have to swipe.
The complaint is that he doesn't know what he's supposed to do. If he'd just read the screen he'd be fine most of the time, since at most places, if the chip reader isn't enabled, it only says "swipe card", whereas if the chip reader is enabled, it says "insert or swipe card".
