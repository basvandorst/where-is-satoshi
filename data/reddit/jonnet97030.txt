Ehh, not flee, the CCP is really good at tracking down running money - if they're going to be in EA/SEA heavy cryptocurrencies, they should at least make sure they have a quick path to cold storage. Biggest problem being that the Great firewall is getting really good at recognizing that traffic is going over a VPN even if it can't decrypt it, so they're just shutting down all strong international crypto. If you can't VPN or get your money out, put it in cold storage; there's no one currency any more they can reliably invest in - either their access to out of state exchanges is rapidly being blocked or their accounts are being nationalized. People bitch about the SEC calling a scam a scam - That's nothing compared to what's about to go down in China, India, Singapore, and Indonesia. I wish I had a better answer for them though besides 'hunker down'. 
edit: I also doubt the CCP is going to just put an end to the whole thing either - I think they're going to require copies of private keys and will use them as a political tool, and their exchanges will be ones of "ideological purification", i.e. nothing can be traded that outright says something bad about the CCP or Chinese policy, but I don't think even they are dumb enough to let this market not grow. They're callous, insulated, and self-serving, but they're not stupid.

Last I heard from a Venezuelan friend, while there is some market manipulation going on, this latest rocket is a coinciding of Chinese investors offshoring their money now that the CCP is talking about putting finance behind the Great Firewall and requiring exchanges to hand over private keys, Venezuelans putting their currency where President one-horse-economy-cant-possibly-fail can't touch it, the politically neutral people that own bitcoin and learned enough about UAHF to say "hey, free money, I'mma sell this BCH and pump it back into bitcoin" dumping and pumping it back, and that after several ICOs and exchanges have actually gone through the paperwork and registered with the SEC, actual real hundreds-of-billions-of-dollars kind of money now have the confidence to invest. It's not uncommon to see a stock go on a wild breakout after some contention brings its existence to light and a lot of people buy seeing subjective value in the investment; I don't understand why the crypto community would think that the securities they have created would behave any differently, regardless of the technological differences.

To be fair, I didn't elaborate on why I used the term "scheming marxist jew" - I have been called a Jew by a number of supposed libertarians for supporting agile-state post-positivist social democracy and continually run into the idea that since libertarianism is the perfect end of history, all current power structures are an artifice of some malevolent powerful Other, and depending on if I'm talking to a right-wing or left-wing libertarian, it typically comes down to multicultural marxist Jews or robot lizard fascists.

As long as it doesn't correct in the other direction before the 9th; ACH takes forever - I really should've pre-funded my Coinbase account when I got it or just bought what I could on credit cards. MACD and stochastics says clear sailing up, up, up though...
I still don't like the fact that Coinbase only allows a combined $500 weekly limit on all credit including fees even if you have multiple lines and a backup bank account connected.

back in November of 2010, my brother gave me 500 BTC, raving madly about how Bitcoin, synthetic perfect scarcity, and the blockchain would be the natural perfect end of history, and the death of all nation states, law, trust, and non-individualism in a rant that would give any cyber-agorist a run for their trustless decentralized money. I didn't quite know how to use the wallet or the mining software he gave me, and I couldn't spend it anywhere, so I lost the wallet address and the passphrase and forgot about it. 
My wife and I started to see investment opportunities in blockchain technology now that the power of the immutable distributed ledger, in my opinion moreso than the coins traded on those ledgers, and I remembered my lost 200 BTC as I checked coinmarketcap wondering when it would hit $3000. 
I threw up on the kitchen table from embarrassment and rage when I put two and two together. I still throw up in my mouth a little from time to time. 
My wife has a saying however that helps me put things in perspective: no matter how many opportunities you catch, no matter how many people you meet, and no matter how many things you do, there will still be an infinite or near impossibly huge number of them that you didn't. You can drive yourself insane looking in the rearview mirror - best to just look at new opportunities ahead if you're not looking back to learn something you can apply looking forward.

And a bunch of people are still calling it Bitcoin ABC. Doesn't change the fact that the crypto world has decided on a stock-style ticker symbol system for currency exchanges and that Bitconnect had BCC long before people were considering the ramifications of segwit and UAHF; if those exchanges are unaware of Bitconnect or just don't care about convention or screwing over a preexisting altcoin, that's their and their users' problem.

Because in the real world, the idea that technical superiority will produce a natural merit which will inexorably lead to rational market actors using it doesn't happen. 
People use what they hear about, they buy and use what is advertised, they use what their community adopts and shows them to use, they use what they know has created organic trust (despite how much organic trust is antithetical to the design of cryptocurrency and the spirit of the community), and when they can get it to work they rarely venture out to anything else, especially something obscure that would take work to get people to adopt on a wide scale, create a brand name for, and integrate into the community. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:27:34
All ideological purity contests eventually butt up against reality as the pettiness of small differences creates fissures of fundamentalism within the community. In the real world, caveat emptor is not enough and completely infeasable at any scale beyond 'small group of privileged middle-upper class kids insulated from misfortune'; the trust gap is impossible to close completely and some level of organic trust networks will be necessary; scale requires some amount of centralization of effort, otherwise most effort is wasted on directionlessness and wasted duplication; ubiquitous planetary adoption will require massive investment, and the investors with real money aren't going to take bitcoin, let alone the exchanges, seriously if traders get scammed, the SEC steps in, and everyone balks; and we're already seeing natural parallels to the modern banking system evolve independently of it for bitcoin: bitcoin reserves and hedge funds, actual bitcoin banks that take btc savings and loan out (at least they're not practicing FRB bs), and the centralization around a single coin to create a single standard with which debts can be tendered and used as a reserve on trading exchanges, regardless of its actual technical utility compared to other coins. 
The structures of today didn't evolve in a vacuum, and they are not, despite the malfeasance and amorality of central bankers, treasuries, and international banks, deliberate constructs created by scheming marxist jews or fascist baby-eaters, depending on which way you swing - they evolved largely out of necessity to fill necessary functions in the maintenance of any civilization of scale. 
Bitcoin, distributed ledger technology, and the cryptocurrency market are entering a phase wherein the ideological fundamentalism and insular community anti-normie spirit is clashing with its actual wider adoption common use as a global extranational currency as it accepts the nature of the real world and of real human nature. 
The One Ideology System of Cryptocurrency Perfection in the Juche of Satoshi seems to be a big religion here. But the more I read not just conversations with Satoshi, but how people talk about where he lights up in conversations and what gets him going, it really sounds like he just wants everything to go toward getting the adoption and use of the coin as simple as possible, and allowing the simplicity and ubiquity to do what it always does in the marketplace. He even at one point said that widespread adoption of lite wallets would be acceptable if it put bitcoin in the hands of that many more people. Yes, he's said things on signature adoption and mempool management and a lot of other technicals, but nothing animates him like conversations getting creative about doing whatever it takes to just get it in people's hands. 
Investors are going to invest in whatever will make them money; people in nations with failing banking systems or totalitarian control over the money supply like the PRC or Iran are going to park their money where it's safer; and there are going to be ideological differences. These things are called compromise, and it is the only path to universal adoption. The SEC has informally said that, despite the hyperbolic reaction to their decision against Bitfinex, their interest in poking their heads into the cryptocurrency world is proportional to the resources they have to spend reacting to fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion in the community, and that's the same stance most countries are taking. 
This is why the conversation is tilting toward the particulars of the technology and of politics - this is what a revolutionary technology mainstreaming onto the world stage looks like. Most people know that central banks are pretty much evil, and I don't trust my money with anyone above community credit unions whose board members I maintain regular contact with, but even I am hesitant to put too much into a currency whose users eschew even the most miniscule of traditional methods of engaging with and hedging organic trust mechanisms, screaming caveat emptor and price of liberty as hundreds of millions of dollars go missing regularly.
TL;DR The conversation is precisely where it needs to be to fight the powah because mainstreaming will be a messy process as the community integrates with the wider world and adoption requires further refinement to the code to accommodate global scale traffic, and some of that integration will mean interacting with and accepting some of the existing organic trust mechanisms in the world.

No need for external engineering. Communities inevitably split based on perceived irreconcilable differences in ideas regardless of their actual reconcilability, and those splits take off when the differences take on the dimension of emotional defensiveness; the process is made that much worse in a community as driven by ideology and rooted in ideas as technically complex as this one. I've never met anyone as passionate as engineers or libertarians - charging engineering with politics is like throwing tritium on a fissing pile of uranium...

He used absolute modifiers, I automatically reject his contention. I can see saying it's a highly risky move for a currency that paradoxically gets its value and credibility from an inherently conservative stance to rapidly implement a policy that has been demonstrated to require additional safety mechanisms I'm still trying to understand, and that dialogue needs to continue on how likely the network will get flooded with 8MB blocks and all that. This is political reactionary behavior at its finest though.

Just the neverending tussle between buyers and sellers, between day traders and investors, all trying to get their dollar out of bitcoin. There is no equilibrium price and there are no two opinions on what the scarcity of the coin or the utility of the blockchain should do to its price. It could be people dumping their BCH and pumping it back into actual bitcoin, it could be a rally after some huge investment group found out about crypto investing, it could be investors adjusting their fundamental analysis now that the scale ceiling has been temporarily shattered. Or it could be the Chinese government pumping the currency in order to accuse Chinese citizens of tax evasion and money laundering in order to CCP all over the Chinese cryptocurrency market. 
There's nothing inherent or intrinsic about price, it's just wherever the collective agglomerations of perception of and actions upon the coin wind up colliding.

if you had your BTC in a private wallet before the fork, find a wallet that supports both BTC and BCH, use your private key to recover your old wallet to the new one or something to that effect, and you will find yourself with the equivalent amount of BCH. Then you transfer the BCH to an exchange that takes it and dump it. if your BTC was in a public wallet like Coinbase or on an exchange that will eventually support BCH, then when they implement it you will just have that in your account and can freely dump it. If your BTC was moved into a private wallet after the fork or on an exchange or public wallet that does not and will not support BCH, then you're just SOL.

The working paper has members of the CBF informally commenting, and all they are talking about is the blockchain, ERC20, and.. whatever the fuck it is ripple runs on, I'm still trying to wrap my head around that one, etc., is self-regulating enough that the system itself is naturally resistant to tampering, even by large forces. 
Outside the autistic obsession over the technology itself, the conservative Finnish government is absolutely looking at ways to protect Finnish investors as more of their money disappears in Eastern European and SEA scam startups and money laundering. The whole ecosystem and community surrounding the technology is the issue here, not the fundamentals.

Thus *you believe* that these technical capabilities give it value. The only value is perceived value, and there's nothing inherent in Bitcoin's blockchain being capped at a certain amoung or it being nearly impervious to external attack (as opposed to internal attack and fraud, which are ubiquitous and rampant and somewhat welcomed as an exercise in 'cleansing the weak') that requires a universal or even general belief that that property gives it value, or that it gives it any commonly perceived amount of value. There's no such thing as inherent and all value is perceived and taken on belief. To those who understand, feel they have need of, and can effectively and profitably utilize the capabilities of the technology in whatever their endeavors are, there is value perceived in its utility to them in their case, and their ability to find value in the capabilities of the technology in their case does more often than not spread the perception of greater value. But if nobody saw utility in it, or felt that said endeavorers utilizing the technology did not mean that there was value in it, it would have no value or close to no value broadly. All value is perceived, all value is fiat.

I mostly agree with you. I brought up the massive petrol spiel because I'm used to the question "why do you think we are stuck with oil" implying the great grand scheme of the TPTB and tin-hat time instead of little-acknowledged market forces. I wasn't trying to call bitcoin a fraud either, and if that's how my wording came across then I apologise and I'll look it over and consider different wording. I was just saying that the people panicking are the ones that want to maintain an environment dedicated to not interfacing with the wider world, whether for ideology or for criminal gain. 
I also agree that as long as that dedication to transparency, consensus, and cryptographic near-invincibility are held close, that it can change a lot of things.

TPTB, the Government, the Illuminati, the global banking cartel, whomever is perceived as being the great evil recoiling violently against the righteousness of the cyber-agorist cause. The Man anyone is referring to when they curse The Man for what's going on. 
To preface, my post states that I am criticizing the generally monolithic assignments of evil to traditional socioeconomic institutions of power and monolithic innocence to the crypto-agorist community. So yes, I do in fact agree with you that taking black and white one-sided views is unhealthy, since that is what I said. 


Before I begin, we have not being using petrol for so long, it's been for about 200 of the 25,000 years of our known Neolithic existence. That's only the last .008% of our organized-resource-harvesting written history. If written history were a clock, we'd only have started using petroleum the last 28 seconds before midnight. 
To the point though, it's not because of patents being suppressed and ingenious inventors dying mysteriously. Not because of properties of physics the government or the illuminati or the global oil cabal or whomever are actively denying. 
The answer is the utility of the petroleum molecule, market inertia, and hucksterism. There are plenty of working prototype hydrogen cars, supercapacitor-based electric cars compressed air cars, water cars, and many more, and nobody is denying that these things are possible or incredible, and their inventors are eagerly securing funding - but their difficulty in fostering demand is proportional to the relative cheapness and ubiquitousness that the inertia of older primary and secondary markets for ICEs and accessories creates. The aftermarket for petrol engines in the USA and around the world is huge - ICE powered machines don't just get taken back after a handful of years, a new year's car sales trails in the market for decades. This makes the knowledge on how to design an ICE cheaper and easier to access since more engineers are trained in this and the nuances of the behavior of heat transfer and the combustion process are more well understood. The knowledge of how to make the toolings to make ICE parts and how to make the ICE parts themselves makes things cheaper, though 3d-printed rapid prototyping is quickly eliminating the inertia in that field. The secondary industry is gigantic, and all those players are specialized in ICE and all those employees are trained in ICE. The whole infrastructure of petrol acquisition, processing, and distribution, is massive and plugged into every capillary of the moving world, and that creates gargantuan amounts of drag, because that well-established logistical infrastructure makes it cheaper simply due to any other motor technology still not having a convenient, ubiquitous way to keep it going, with the exception of electric cars in those parts of the world where people have dependable two-phase power and money enough for an electric car. 
So all this inertia not only creates a cheaper primary and secondary market by way of innovation always being cheaper and easier than invention, it also creates more convenience in its ubiquity, it creates a sense of familiarity, and it creates an emotional gap that the inventor of any new technology must always hurdle. Not only in consumers, but also in investors.
There is much more demand for non-petrol cars in parts of the world with little petrol infrastructure or market inertia, especially where such things also don't have to conform to consumer safety standards. India is a prime example - jugaad has made a good run of getting a large number of cars to run on lots of things, and there are the beginnings of hydrogen, LNG, and compressed air shops to fill these myriad cars with. 
All of this goes for petrochemistry as well. Petroleum just does so many things and becomes so many things, and does it well! Yes, the externality of being completely dependent on the oil extractors and a fossil fuel are greater at this point than its utility, but its utility combined with the fact that we know a lot more about not only how to make things from petroleum, but how to make and distribute them profitably and how to figure out how to make new things from it more cheaply.
Which brings me to the second point - for every working prototype of a new means of transport, there are a hundred claiming perpetual motion, dimensional energy harvesting, new forms of matter, and denying access to their creation to all those who could see how it works, or at least to check for any classical magicians tricks like hidden batteries or lies about torque and gear ratios, or the host of youtube videos of guys with HHO engines having been found out to have had purified clear gasoline or other fuel in that bottle of "water", or those that, while rightly claiming that they're using water to run the car on, are found to be using more energy to crack the water than it would take to just turn the crankshaft directly. 
I will fully admit that I do not believe that we understand everything about physics, and that out there someone probably has discovered something revolutionary, and that there has been pushback by entrenched energy interests on the widespread adoption of new technology. However, their power is not omnipotent, being demonstrated by losing the fight against wind and solar power adoption in only a handful of years extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, extraordinary evidence requires comprehensive experimentation and an adherence to the negation principle, and a youtube video of a project that has not been replicated in a lab or on separate occasions or even in public does not count, and the conspiracy cult that has grown up around them does not make up for it. Those scant few technically feasible ways of providing energy for machines left are often too dangerous to put in something that sees such rugged use as consumer appliances and machines. 
None of which bodes well for the confidence of investors, manufacturers, or the general public. Few want to invest in new technolgies, especially ones that by their nature require immense physical assets and manufacturing goods and the crapshoot the ubiquity of false claims and permissiveness of believers creates on actually putting cash in something that works and scales will deter even the most adamant of bourgeoisie revolutionaries. Capitalism, because of the rarely acknowledged drag of market inertia and resultant excessive capital to change, is a conservative system, and conservative systems generate status quos.  


Given that the Bitcoin Conference is hosted by a guy that can never set foot in the state of Ohio without never leaving a federal prison again, and probably should just never come back to the USA, because of his long list of convictions of foreclosure fraud, defrauding the elderly and non-English speakers, and investors, i'd say there's no need to compare because most of the people defrauding the regular market are having a field day with the community's eager acceptance of blind evangelism as objective logic, because of course libertarians have the sole claim to true, pure logic and clear objective understanding, and in this blindness being ripped off by the same fucking people using the same social engineering methods they defrauded homeowners with. As for interbank fixing, those interbank indicators are like GDP: the inventor of GDP stated clearly and repeatedly that his calculation was for nothing more than calculating what the output capacity for arms production for WWII could be and what was going on. He repeatedly and loudly said, often shouting at people at the League of Nations and the UN, that it was not an indicator of any useful peacetime national statistic. However, humans, especially men at the apex with a need for a new dick to swing in everyone's faces, eagerly took this one single number as a way to rank every nation one dimensionally in order to say "my number is the bigger number!" Similarly, LIBOR and the like were designed as rough estimators, sort of an international technical indicator, always meant to be a suggestor of specific things. But international banks just said "it's a number, it changes, it seems to correspond to stuff, so we'll use it for tacking things to". I'm as unconcerned with interbank fixing as I am with GDP because the numbers the banks are fixing never meant all that much in the first place, and both are just products of politicians looking for something to take home to the base and rushing processes they didn't understand through in time for the next town hall or election. 


They have every right to panic, because Bitcoin is frequently undermined, both by community zealotry, and by the constant predation and fraud enabled by the community's insistence on such things being the price of liberty and a better option than living under the regulationist's dystopia. 
TL;DR the man is Tha Powah, I just said that black and white reasoning is what is at fault here and that monolithicism is in general unhealthy, we still use petrol because you underestimate the cost of proving a new technology and driving out an existing convenient and ubiquitous one, and the measures of fraud in both communities even out because it's the same people generally and the community celebrates them, and regular people wanting to use and invest in bitcoin have every right to be panicked that Bitcoin will be undermined and their funds stolen because a sizeable amount of the community does that every damn day.

While QE, in moderation and precisely applied by publicly accountable banks, is an important tool in the monetary policy toolbox, it would be unwise to do away with it. However, if blockchain technology and some mix of cryptocurrencies were to render international banks from fractional lending, I would sacrifice to the old gods and life a life of happy quiet penitence...  
What I'm saying is that since there is no such thing as inherent value and all value is perceived, all value is not objectively backed by any inherent thing and is therefore fiat. Bitcoin can't be "better" than fiat in a general sense, nor can anything be better in the general sense than any thing else for that matter, because "better" and "worse" are one dimensional measurements of value, and perceptions of value are always in the context of the perceiver, the need, the activity, and those are rarely one dimensional. It can be almost universally perceived as being "better" than fiat in specific senses, such as at doing the various things it was designed to do better than fiat, such as transfer stores of value on a much less easily manipulated ledger than fiat at current, and transfer without a bank or money service as a third party (the idea that bitcoin doesn't need a third party to trust is false - There's OS and software and hardware designers and manufacturers, ISPs, and the safety of the cryptography transcrypting everything). But even then nothing about that makes it universally and objectively "better" at doing that one particular thing in that one particular context - just largely perceived as better, and only by those who know what the hell they're perceiving in the first place. 
No utility or functionality or scarcity adds inherent value, and no value is universal. Bitcoin's source of value and the nature of its value is no different than fiat's source of value and the nature of its value, because the source of all value is the belief that whatever hodgepodge of emotional attachment, beliefs of the value of utility or profitability, or something else entirely, gives it any value. They're no different in that their value is perceived, and that it is perceived in context. Bitcoin's capabilities certainly hold less value to technophobes far more content with their organic trust networks than with learning something new that solves problems they don't perceive to have or are more okay with than it does to tech-savvy people devoted to revolutionizing third-party accountability. 
To me, in the context of wanting big gains in my investments to make up for being just above homeless and not having had an opportunity to create a sizeable fund to trade with yet also not wanting to do wage work until I die at 65, being generally of the idea that Satoshi will be to recordkeeping and secure transactions what Newton was to physics and calculus and thus warm to the technology despite the community, and being of the sense that the bitcoin reserve currency market is larger and more robust than the Ethereum or Litecoin reserve markets will translate to an easier time trading, and being that I am still a bit more intimidated by Ether's gas and data and smart contract stuff than I am at the price of one BTC, that therefore, to me, in this context, bitcoin's perceived value is greater than fiat. Change any of those variables and the whole thing is out the window. 
So... tl;dr I guess is that I'm suggesting that since everyone will perceive the merits of fiat and bitcoin differently in the context of what they perceive as meritous, necessary, or valuable in the myriad parts of their life, there's nothing universal about their value, and therefore bitcoin can't be better in a general sense, though it can be better in some specific circumstances. 
In the words of one of one of my trans church congregants, "Better and worse are for absolutists and people that think their opinion and God's absolute truth are one and the same; the only thing that exists is 'different'".

As opposed to Bitfinex disappearing with scads of cash? At least the financial system has chargeback for fraud. The crypto world equivalent has no chargeback and regularly engages in stealing from their customers and disappearing, chants of "caveat emptor" trailing behind them. 
Bankers love the stuff - the currency trading charts don't look like flatlines before January of this year compared to after for no reason. Regulators and big data enthusiasts love the technology - there's talk of the Census Bureau making their historically adept secrecy even better by securing interview information from field reps with it, and other departments and bureaus that require a high degree of verifiability of information, like the BLM. There really is only acrimony over just how accepting the community has been of fraud, racketeering, theft, money laundering, tax evasion, and all manner of antisocial, societally damaging behavior and the doublethink of apologising for and enabling this behavior on the one hand and in having evangelical faith while simultaneously settling into a state of paranoia and military-hardened security and distrust of "normies" over it on the other.
This isn't a "banker's panic" - the only ones panicking are the lice preying on people, the snake oil salesmen, the Eastern European money launderers all fleeing as this technology finally crosses the border from Cryptolandia into the real world. The Howey Test is easy to pass, and the definition of business partners and accredited investors insofar as doing business with the average man with some bits and bucks in his pocket, has always been a low and easy bar to clear in the USA. Securities like LAToken are revolutionary, and my state's annual community credit union conference had a breakout session looking at how to use this setup to make their collective stock of illiquid assets more fungible, but the resultant need for investor protections and identification and verification, of the traditional need for escrow accounts to be FDIC ensured, while if implemented would bring in a tidal wave of investment, is seen as anathema. 
The USG and Japanese governments are rapidly moving sensitive material over to immutable distributed tokenless ledgers, the old "ripoff" financial sector is completely changing their backend and in the process massively reducing the capability of fraud, both within the banks and from external actors. The governments of the world, the central banks, and the international financial system, for their numerous faults, will be more healthy for the widespread acceptance and utilization of blockchain technology. 
What is crumbling is the idea that everyone so quietly and secretly hates all governance and authority that the blockchain protocol and distributed currency will just inherently wipe out all centralized authority, or that the technology itself will just naturally destroy all centralization. It's just a tool, and will be used in any manner it can be, as all tools are. What is also crumbling is the paranoid schizophrenic attitude that sees all government as inherently and monolithically evil, incapable, and the antithesis of collective contribution, and the Bitcoin community and its puritanical take on Objectivism, avoidance of non-transactional relationships, intentional blindness to a near-ubiquitous state of FUD, lies, scams, hacks, and organized crime, and disdain for normies and the "weak" caught up in them, and universal trustlessness, as inherently pure and good, and the view from that paranoid perspective that this is all the Man fighting back and losing. Then again, this is the community whose conference is hosted by a man who cannot re-enter several US states because of arrest warrants for defrauding people in foreclosure, investors, and the elderly - and a community with members that are not reprimanded for blaming these fraud victims and celebrating his ability to fleece them. 
TL;DR Everyone loves the stuff and can't incorporate it fast enough and the traditional systems are being made healthier for it, the only people panicking are thieves and price manipulators.

TPTB, the Government, the Illuminati, the global banking cartel, whomever is perceived as being the great evil recoiling violently against the righteousness of the cyber-agorist cause. The Man anyone is referring to when they curse The Man for what's going on. 
To preface, my post states that I am criticizing the generally monolithic assignments of evil to traditional socioeconomic institutions of power and monolithic innocence to the crypto-agorist community. So yes, I do in fact agree with you that taking black and white one-sided views is unhealthy, since that is what I said. 


Before I begin, we have not being using petrol for so long, it's been for about 200 of the 25,000 years of our known Neolithic existence. That's only the last .008% of our organized-resource-harvesting written history. If written history were a clock, we'd only have started using petroleum the last 28 seconds before midnight. 
To the point though, it's not because of patents being suppressed and ingenious inventors dying mysteriously. Not because of properties of physics the government or the illuminati or the global oil cabal or whomever are actively denying. 
The answer is the utility of the petroleum molecule, market inertia, and hucksterism. There are plenty of working prototype hydrogen cars, supercapacitor-based electric cars compressed air cars, water cars, and many more, and nobody is denying that these things are possible or incredible, and their inventors are eagerly securing funding - but their difficulty in fostering demand is proportional to the relative cheapness and ubiquitousness that the inertia of older primary and secondary markets for ICEs and accessories creates. The aftermarket for petrol engines in the USA and around the world is huge - ICE powered machines don't just get taken back after a handful of years, a new year's car sales trails in the market for decades. This makes the knowledge on how to design an ICE cheaper and easier to access since more engineers are trained in this and the nuances of the behavior of heat transfer and the combustion process are more well understood. The knowledge of how to make the toolings to make ICE parts and how to make the ICE parts themselves makes things cheaper, though 3d-printed rapid prototyping is quickly eliminating the inertia in that field. The secondary industry is gigantic, and all those players are specialized in ICE and all those employees are trained in ICE. The whole infrastructure of petrol acquisition, processing, and distribution, is massive and plugged into every capillary of the moving world, and that creates gargantuan amounts of drag, because that well-established logistical infrastructure makes it cheaper simply due to any other motor technology still not having a convenient, ubiquitous way to keep it going, with the exception of electric cars in those parts of the world where people have dependable two-phase power and money enough for an electric car. 
So all this inertia not only creates a cheaper primary and secondary market by way of innovation always being cheaper and easier than invention, it also creates more convenience in its ubiquity, it creates a sense of familiarity, and it creates an emotional gap that the inventor of any new technology must always hurdle. Not only in consumers, but also in investors.
There is much more demand for non-petrol cars in parts of the world with little petrol infrastructure or market inertia, especially where such things also don't have to conform to consumer safety standards. India is a prime example - jugaad has made a good run of getting a large number of cars to run on lots of things, and there are the beginnings of hydrogen, LNG, and compressed air shops to fill these myriad cars with. 
All of this goes for petrochemistry as well. Petroleum just does so many things and becomes so many things, and does it well! Yes, the externality of being completely dependent on the oil extractors and a fossil fuel are greater at this point than its utility, but its utility combined with the fact that we know a lot more about not only how to make things from petroleum, but how to make and distribute them profitably and how to figure out how to make new things from it more cheaply.
Which brings me to the second point - for every working prototype of a new means of transport, there are a hundred claiming perpetual motion, dimensional energy harvesting, new forms of matter, and denying access to their creation to all those who could see how it works, or at least to check for any classical magicians tricks like hidden batteries or lies about torque and gear ratios, or the host of youtube videos of guys with HHO engines having been found out to have had purified clear gasoline or other fuel in that bottle of "water", or those that, while rightly claiming that they're using water to run the car on, are found to be using more energy to crack the water than it would take to just turn the crankshaft directly. 
I will fully admit that I do not believe that we understand everything about physics, and that out there someone probably has discovered something revolutionary, and that there has been pushback by entrenched energy interests on the widespread adoption of new technology. However, their power is not omnipotent, being demonstrated by losing the fight against wind and solar power adoption in only a handful of years extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, extraordinary evidence requires comprehensive experimentation and an adherence to the negation principle, and a youtube video of a project that has not been replicated in a lab or on separate occasions or even in public does not count, and the conspiracy cult that has grown up around them does not make up for it. Those scant few technically feasible ways of providing energy for machines left are often too dangerous to put in something that sees such rugged use as consumer appliances and machines. 
None of which bodes well for the confidence of investors, manufacturers, or the general public. Few want to invest in new technolgies, especially ones that by their nature require immense physical assets and manufacturing goods and the crapshoot the ubiquity of false claims and permissiveness of believers creates on actually putting cash in something that works and scales will deter even the most adamant of bourgeoisie revolutionaries. Capitalism, because of the rarely acknowledged drag of market inertia and resultant excessive capital to change, is a conservative system, and conservative systems generate status quos.  


Given that the Bitcoin Conference is hosted by a guy that can never set foot in the state of Ohio without never leaving a federal prison again, and probably should just never come back to the USA, because of his long list of convictions of foreclosure fraud, defrauding the elderly and non-English speakers, and investors, i'd say there's no need to compare because most of the people defrauding the regular market are having a field day with the community's eager acceptance of blind evangelism as objective logic, because of course libertarians have the sole claim to true, pure logic and clear objective understanding, and in this blindness being ripped off by the same fucking people using the same social engineering methods they defrauded homeowners with. As for interbank fixing, those interbank indicators are like GDP: the inventor of GDP stated clearly and repeatedly that his calculation was for nothing more than calculating what the output capacity for arms production for WWII could be and what was going on. He repeatedly and loudly said, often shouting at people at the League of Nations and the UN, that it was not an indicator of any useful peacetime national statistic. However, humans, especially men at the apex with a need for a new dick to swing in everyone's faces, eagerly took this one single number as a way to rank every nation one dimensionally in order to say "my number is the bigger number!" Similarly, LIBOR and the like were designed as rough estimators, sort of an international technical indicator, always meant to be a suggestor of specific things. But international banks just said "it's a number, it changes, it seems to correspond to stuff, so we'll use it for tacking things to". I'm as unconcerned with interbank fixing as I am with GDP because the numbers the banks are fixing never meant all that much in the first place, and both are just products of politicians looking for something to take home to the base and rushing processes they didn't understand through in time for the next town hall or election. 


They have every right to panic, because Bitcoin is frequently undermined, both by community zealotry, and by the constant predation and fraud enabled by the community's insistence on such things being the price of liberty and a better option than living under the regulationist's dystopia. 
TL;DR the man is Tha Powah, I just said that black and white reasoning is what is at fault here and that monolithicism is in general unhealthy, we still use petrol because you underestimate the cost of proving a new technology and driving out an existing convenient and ubiquitous one, and the measures of fraud in both communities even out because it's the same people generally and the community celebrates them, and regular people wanting to use and invest in bitcoin have every right to be panicked that Bitcoin will be undermined and their funds stolen because a sizeable amount of the community does that every damn day.

While I agree that FRL is a monstrous way to add money to an economy and having a private, unaccountable central bank that has preyed on the USA, The Bundesbank is a public central bank and the euro and before it the deutschemark were fiat, and The Federal Reserve says fuck all about their having value, it's people tendering their debts with dollars and accepting certain amounts of value, measured as price, as the cost they associate with whatever they are receiving in return for their tender. The price of any currency is the sum of the debts tendered in it and the price people will exchange it for on the forex. If scarcity compared to demand created any sort of inherent value, diamonds would be cheap and ubiquitous, and commodity crops would be more valuable than gold. But they don't, because there's no such thing as inherent. All value is perceived. This is why there was no point in tethering one unit of perceived value to the physical scarcity of another unit of perceived value, regardless of the fact that is has a history of being regarded as having value. It's redundant, continually creates zero-sum games and hoarding, never creates stable prices outside of government price controls, like the USG just saying that 1 oz of gold is $35 as there is nothing inherent about the property of money or of gold that makes this price set true, and allots disproportionate socioeconomic power to those with enough of whatever the scarce resource is to hold economies hostage, as is what happened with five nations withdrawing their gold reserves and nearly plunging the US economy back into depression (the Nixon shock was the worst of all possible ways to deal with it, but it was still a problem that had to be dealth with and right then and there). That's precisely why Bretton-Woods failed, why no natural price equilibrium has ever actually existed, and why monetary policy has replaced currency reserves - there's no such thing as inherent value. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:02:59
While QE, in moderation and precisely applied by publicly accountable banks, is an important tool in the monetary policy toolbox, it would be unwise to do away with it. However, if blockchain technology and some mix of cryptocurrencies were to render international banks from fractional lending, I would sacrifice to the old gods and life a life of happy quiet penitence...  
What I'm saying is that since there is no such thing as inherent value and all value is perceived, all value is not objectively backed by any inherent thing and is therefore fiat. Bitcoin can't be "better" than fiat in a general sense, nor can anything be better in the general sense than any thing else for that matter, because "better" and "worse" are one dimensional measurements of value, and perceptions of value are always in the context of the perceiver, the need, the activity, and those are rarely one dimensional. It can be almost universally perceived as being "better" than fiat in specific senses, such as at doing the various things it was designed to do better than fiat, such as transfer stores of value on a much less easily manipulated ledger than fiat at current, and transfer without a bank or money service as a third party (the idea that bitcoin doesn't need a third party to trust is false - There's OS and software and hardware designers and manufacturers, ISPs, and the safety of the cryptography transcrypting everything). But even then nothing about that makes it universally and objectively "better" at doing that one particular thing in that one particular context - just largely perceived as better, and only by those who know what the hell they're perceiving in the first place. 
No utility or functionality or scarcity adds inherent value, and no value is universal. Bitcoin's source of value and the nature of its value is no different than fiat's source of value and the nature of its value, because the source of all value is the belief that whatever hodgepodge of emotional attachment, beliefs of the value of utility or profitability, or something else entirely, gives it any value. They're no different in that their value is perceived, and that it is perceived in context. Bitcoin's capabilities certainly hold less value to technophobes far more content with their organic trust networks than with learning something new that solves problems they don't perceive to have or are more okay with than it does to tech-savvy people devoted to revolutionizing third-party accountability. 
To me, in the context of wanting big gains in my investments to make up for being just above homeless and not having had an opportunity to create a sizeable fund to trade with yet also not wanting to do wage work until I die at 65, being generally of the idea that Satoshi will be to recordkeeping and secure transactions what Newton was to physics and calculus and thus warm to the technology despite the community, and being of the sense that the bitcoin reserve currency market is larger and more robust than the Ethereum or Litecoin reserve markets will translate to an easier time trading, and being that I am still a bit more intimidated by Ether's gas and data and smart contract stuff than I am at the price of one BTC, that therefore, to me, in this context, bitcoin's perceived value is greater than fiat. Change any of those variables and the whole thing is out the window. 
So... tl;dr I guess is that I'm suggesting that since everyone will perceive the merits of fiat and bitcoin differently in the context of what they perceive as meritous, necessary, or valuable in the myriad parts of their life, there's nothing universal about their value, and therefore bitcoin can't be better in a general sense, though it can be better in some specific circumstances. 
In the words of one of one of my trans church congregants, "Better and worse are for absolutists and people that think their opinion and God's absolute truth are one and the same; the only thing that exists is 'different'".

I would pay what I believed it was worth. Demand is a fickle thing of belief and perception, and any trader's or group of traders' ability to determine what is scarce and abundant relative to what they perceive to be the supply they can get to what they perceive to be demand is itself only a perception. Nothing is inherent. 
It's not denying the fundamental basis of how economies work, because economics is a philosophy, not a science. It's denying the assumption of neoclassical economics that supply and demand are universally objectively understood, that value is inherent since these things are objective, and that individual agents, being rational calculators of objective information regarding the value of a supply of something relative to its demand, will spontaneously generate ideal price equilibriums.  The only people left defending it are those made rich and powerful by the imbalances and externalities resulting from its utilization by economic policymakers and its autistic view of human relations that conveniently excludes those very externalities that prove exception to the 'rule', and those who cannot let go of a continental philosophy of positivistic, objective, mechanistic model of human behavior crafted almost entirely in reaction to the preceding medieval normative and generally pessimistic model of human behavior, centuries before psychology, sociology, and neuroscience showed human nature to be far different and much more complicated and less monolithic than what the likes of Thomas Paine, John Locke, Fernand Braudel, John Stuart Mill, and the Ronald Reagan of Enlightenment economic philosophers, Adam Smith, could ever have hoped to conceive.

Even though banks are the most eager adopters of the technology and the cryptocurrency market cap is as high as it is because of banks and big money investing, but ok. 
Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins to create artificial scarcity and access is restricted to having to go through and pay fees to exchanges or learning how to mine (wanna talk about something with next to no value these days...) or some other way of interfacing with the blockchain. That is also, and seemingly ubiquitously ignored, access restricted to those with access to electronics and the Internet, and the funds to buy bits. And all of this is restricted by the sustainability of the complex harmony of the dance all of the ISP backbones, all of the electronic devices and their programmers and designers, all of the public infrastructure and public policy across which transactions between individuals can occur, which is no mean feat, for any of this technology to exist or be widely adopted and used in the first place. 
This is the view of those that see any public agent or bank, no matter what fraud and scam they are trying to stop, as monolithically evil and incapable of said help, and any paranoid ancap, no matter how much enabling of theft, fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, and erosion of trust they engender, as inherently good and those aforementioned things as more impossible and more the result of the Other's outside interference at a distance the closer one gets to the religious apotheosis of complete self-worship anti-community agorism. 
In reality, most humans have readier access to cash, barter, and local escrow and holding services, and are at a lower rate of misjudging common perceptions of reputation and falling victim to fraud or theft, especially in the OECD nations, than they would in the cryptocurrency ecosystem as it is, given the proportion of theft and fraud relative to the age and size of the community, and of the eagerness of the community to victim blame and resist implementing organic means of trust, accountability, and recompense, so even if they have to go through your evil apple banker they still have a good chance of getting and keeping their apples or getting compensated in case those apples are swindled.

Nothing "resolves itself", people resolve things, and through their perception of how to solve it. Multisig and timelocks are indeed fantastic fixes, but nothing guarantees that a good resolution would just have inherently been found or that the people implementing it would implement it in a manner that solves it. 
And on top of that, while I do agree with you that exchanges are learning the basics of business, customer security, customer service, and investor confidence the hard way, and that sooner rather than later they'll be pretty safe places to park money, they are only one component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and the security of exchanges still doesn't invalidate my primary premise that the only people panicking are those who thought that being on the internet and in the blockchain meant they could create a business and handle and change money at a distance from reality and were totally unprepared to be told that their business is a business, and it is in and a part of the world, and that this world has rules; those whose view is black and white, monolithic, and paranoid of all external power; and predators who are here because the wild west attitude creates an air of permissiveness and victim blaming which is fertile ground for theft, fraud, and abuse.

As opposed to Bitfinex disappearing with scads of cash? At least the financial system has chargeback for fraud. The crypto world equivalent has no chargeback and regularly engages in stealing from their customers and disappearing, chants of "caveat emptor" trailing behind them. 
Bankers love the stuff - the currency trading charts don't look like flatlines before January of this year compared to after for no reason. Regulators and big data enthusiasts love the technology - there's talk of the Census Bureau making their historically adept secrecy even better by securing interview information from field reps with it, and other departments and bureaus that require a high degree of verifiability of information, like the BLM. There really is only acrimony over just how accepting the community has been of fraud, racketeering, theft, money laundering, tax evasion, and all manner of antisocial, societally damaging behavior and the doublethink of apologising for and enabling this behavior on the one hand and in having evangelical faith while simultaneously settling into a state of paranoia and military-hardened security and distrust of "normies" over it on the other.
This isn't a "banker's panic" - the only ones panicking are the lice preying on people, the snake oil salesmen, the Eastern European money launderers all fleeing as this technology finally crosses the border from Cryptolandia into the real world. The Howey Test is easy to pass, and the definition of business partners and accredited investors insofar as doing business with the average man with some bits and bucks in his pocket, has always been a low and easy bar to clear in the USA.

Don't need code level fraud to take the money and run. I know Goldman Shits created the fake IPOs, and that's what I'm saying is happening in the case of the scam IPOs - that many of those people with a history of banking fraud moved over and use their investments to pump the hype of ICOs to get other people on board, so we get ICOs that say "over $3m invested in the presale, get on board now!" and they just take the money and leave. The authorities responsible for the creation of the ICOs are the ones pumping the ICOs and dumping them and/or just walking away. No code-level engineering is necessary when the oldest social hacks in history still work so well.
The reason I emphasized the ICOs and ITOs is because investors are ballooning bitcoin specifically because its the currency they need to get in on these red-hot offerings. The ICO bubble is the Bitcoin bubble since bitcoin is the reserve currency of most of the altcoin market.

I mostly agree with you. I brought up the massive petrol spiel because I'm used to the question "why do you think we are stuck with oil" implying the great grand scheme of the TPTB and tin-hat time instead of little-acknowledged market forces. I wasn't trying to call bitcoin a fraud either, and if that's how my wording came across then I apologise and I'll look it over and consider different wording. I was just saying that the people panicking are the ones that want to maintain an environment dedicated to not interfacing with the wider world, whether for ideology or for criminal gain. 
I also agree that as long as that dedication to transparency, consensus, and cryptographic near-invincibility are held close, that it can change a lot of things.
