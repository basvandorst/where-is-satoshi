Well  if I’m taking my own advice, my portfolio is doing fairly well. That said, I’m  not asking for anything from you plebs. Do as you please.

Lol. I guess you missed the sarcasm /s. No one knows for sure but I can definitely see up to a 50% pullback.
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:32:41
I got downvoted when I said we were heading for a 20-30% correction.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:27:26
How do you know that? Impossible. /s

In March, 300 Million tether were printed. The price then took a nose dive. Can someone confirm when the last CBOE futures expiration date was? Not the one this week, but the one before? I wonder if there really is a correlation.

No more than once a day.

It’s so interesting that we’ve had so much good news over the past week and the markets hardly responded. We get some FUD re upbit it crashes as if Bitcoin itself were hacked.
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:00:33
Bruh trying to get there, myself. People don’t talk about how much they have but know that most people who actually own crypto hold less than 1 BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-15 13:05:06
This was intentional. Whenever bitcoin looks to break out, FUD relating to an exchange, regulation, or scam comes out. It’s so obvious yet people panick and sell every time.

Does anyone know how many times we’ve crossed 9k in the last month or so? At least 5 times right?
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:40:08
I’ll save you the trouble.  Tomorrow will be the last day of 8k.
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:04:05
I don’t even do TA but this looks like a triple bottom. This may be a good thing.
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:21:40
Okay so what happens from here on out?
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:47:02
Fool me once. We are onto their game and have been buying the dips.

Idk what’s most volatile, the Kilauea volcano, North Korea, Megan Markle’s family, or bitcoin.

Beautifully shot. Sequencing reminds me a lot of Memento. You’re very talented, OP.

Its a film, bro. The job is to entertain, not teach or inform. You were looking for a documentary. This wasn’t it.
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:48:58
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:57:07
This needed to happen. I’m actually excited.

Why would anyone sell at -60% when they believe this bear market will turn around? It’s not greed. It’s common sense.
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:24:41
June 6th finally came!
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:14:36
The catalyst of that bear market was a major hack of the largest exchange at the time. Most presumed bitcoin would never recover. Now you have nothing but good news surrounding bitcoin...no way it’s going to take that long to recover. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:21:40
Won’t ever get tired of seeing this.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:20:54
Just look at the charts. This is why people were FOMOing at $20k. At $10k-15k people were warned but chose to ignore that advice. Not only would a 20-30% correction be healthy, it’s in line with what happens in every BTC bull market.
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:05:30
Like clockwork. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:54:55
Tbh, I see a 20-30% correction on the horizon.
@_date: 2019-06-17 01:15:20
Lmfao. It’s not that deep
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:49:34
I think whales are manipulating the price around $9k purely for maximum Vegeta meme utility.

Thinking of making it more permanent with a hodl tattoo.

Ugh, that’s how I feel when I look at my portfolio. I could have had 2x the amount of every coin. Depressing.
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:40:25
You absolutely needed a phone line. Misinformation on their part.
