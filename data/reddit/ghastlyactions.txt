Same reason anyone uses any form of currency, but less tied to any particular one government. Did you really think it would remain anonymous and unregulated forever? It had to evolve or die.

You say that like it's a bad thing.

That's great new for everyone. They'll come up with a way to regulate and monitor the market and transactions so they can move out of the shady black market and in to the world of real currencies. That should help with general confidence in crypto.

What's the reason for it? We don't have much inflation, which would be the most obvious answer but doesn't apply. Is it the release of a new bill (new 1s and 20s etc)? Did we decide to print more "real" money so less is electronic? Don't think we actually added that much to our econony. Explanation?

Isn't it more like asking the CEO of Ford what he thinks about electric cars? I mean... if they thought it was a good investment, wouldn't they buy in? Sure they may have some biases and old school ways of thought, but they are experts and industry leaders as well as savvy business people in the same industry. Or are they direct competitors in some way, in which JP Morgan could not buy in?

But much more, yeah.

I mean... unless businesses refuse to accept it anywhere....
