This should be an option when viewing charts. Nice work!

If more people join the 1%, it is no longer the 1%. I think this is the overall goal everyone wants.

It isn't silly because they are without a doubt the go to place for noobs to buy Bitcoin.

Will I have twins if I get Banged with 2 Dicks?

Thanks for this! It seems to be up and running here. I'm just waiting on the faucet now.

Isn't MS part of the Etherium Alliance though? Maybe he isn't hinting at BTC , but ETH.

This is true, but I also have financial freedom like I have never had before. When I decided to take the plunge into crypto and buy some BTC I learned really fast how hard and how much lack of control I have over my own hard earned money. The penalties, delays and overall headache of doing whatever the fuck I want with my money was the first thing that opened my eyes to what I believe was the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and the power of Bitcoin to give financial freedom to others besides the Elite.

No, you want to get in and get out but leave some skin in the game at all times. For me the real definition of HODL is too keep some skin in this Bitcoin game and take your initial fiat investment out as well as some profit depending on how much you have. That's the wise approach to crypto in it's current state IMO. 
I believe in the technology, but it's going to take a while to convince other less technical people until it's easy to use, with low fees, and near instantaneous transactions.

Agreed. As down as they are these days, they are not stupid like many like to think. Think IBM after they lost the PC wars. Block-chain tech really reminds me of the early PC and Internet booms. I'm an old head and I have that same feeling I did back when I was 12 logging into Prodigy Internet. This Block-chain Tech ushered in by Bitcoin and others is really huge for the future.

Bought in at 4200$. Took profit, yet still have skin in the game. I'm  hodling on tight through this. I feel bad for those who bought in high and are going to panic sell.

Maybe, just maybe the guy dismissed it on bits of information given to him. Maybe now he finally grasps the idea and now sees the potential of it. I have plenty of people that I have tried to explain BTC in a short window of conversation time and I was getting "A deer in headlights " look. Once I told them to do some research as I couldn't sum it up in a nice tidy package for them, they finally got it after taking the time to research it and fully grasp the concept. It could also be the money though.

I think ETH has a pretty high cieling as well. I bought more ETH when I first bought crypto because of what they're doing with the Blockchain tech. BTC is  knocking the door down and ETH will explode soon after.

Luckily, he worded it correctly and technically he has an out. It would be quite a different story if he typed testicle ; p .

My Face is Melting and I only have about 7/8 of 1 BTC.
