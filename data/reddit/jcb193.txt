Well shoot, I’ve been doing it wrong all along.
So you’re not supposed to sell your BTC each night before you go to bed?
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:19:37
How about you articulate your downvote?
I’d love to hear the explanation about how Bitcoin thrives under a US ban. Or how banks don’t exert massive influence on politicians .
I never said I was happy about this, just telling how it is.

So many young idealistic kids in this thread. I love it don’t ever change!
But eventually you’ll figure out that the only way bitcoin survives is if the banks can make more money with its existence (exchange fees or management fees) than they can without.
Bitcoin is never going to the moon if it becomes an illegal currency.
The best bet is that some bank tries to become first mover and tap into the bitcoin craze and all the other banks follow suit and allow it to become mainstream before politicians can rule on it.  (Kind of like robot cars).

Why would the banks have taken an interest up until 2-3 years ago?  They are a $17trillion dollar industry. 
I love your straw man arguments, but 99% of bitcoin users will disappear the day they cant legally on-off ramp funds.  
I don't want this scenario anymore than you do, but you have to admit illegal Bitcoin will be a fraction of the value of legal Bitcoin.

Yeah...but try getting bitcoin-plated monster cables.

"That will be .0000001765 Bitcoin for your candy bar sir."
"Oh shoot, I only have .0000001764 on me right now."

I love bitcoin, but what do you think would happen if Bitcoin tried to handle just 1% of Visa's daily transactions for one day?
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:12:00
Ahhh, welcome to Bitcoin!  It only goes up!!!
Till it goes down.

Because at the end of the day, crypto is still a giant PITA to use.  Maybe not as bad as going down to the bank for a wire transfer, but certainly not much better...yet.
Hoping for the future merge of UI and crypto.

Fraud or not, I still haven't found a compelling argument against having the major corporations just copy the source code of the most successful coins and create their own coin.
If this is to be mainstream,I dont think your everyday consumer will care about decentralization until it's too late?  
@_date: 2019-04-16 15:03:56
I assumed all this drama would bring women into crypto. Just need to bundle it as reality tv.

Explain to me how BSV has held any value today and is only down 10%?
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:39:13
Merchants offering discounts, coupons, or points for payments with bitcoin will work.
Unfortunately, amazon will likely be the winner and we’ll all be using an amazon coin, not a bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:08:25
Up 10% and the followed by a down 15%.  Rinse, repeat.
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:26:18
Well, I hope you're right, because the runs certainly haven't been net positive the last six months. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:46:48
A ton of action on BTC, ETH, BCH, and LTC. All the Coinbase casuals coming back??
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:54:27
This is what scares me. 
Average Joe doesn't care about decentralization or upending banks. He wants it to be easier than what he has.
Amazon will accomplish that......
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:13:40
"Make moves that have a worst case bottom."
How does he accomplish this? Should you have stop-loss on every stock/fund you own?
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:37:56
Because there is no good reason to use PayPal at any retailer. Just a .5% discount on amazon using amazoncoin could make it the biggest coin use case in like a week.
@_date: 2018-12-30 02:56:17
I have no issues with this premise, but isn’t it more realistic to say that blockchain or crypto might follow this path, not necessarily Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:47:09
Makes sense, thanks!
