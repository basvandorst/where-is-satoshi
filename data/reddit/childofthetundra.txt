This particular article was just a Quora answer that Forbes optioned. Essentially broadcasts what you wrote to a larger audience — but doesn’t pay anything. That said, I really don’t mind a few bucks on the principle of the thing. I get really bothered by fake news and lazy reporting, and I think owning your mistakes is super healthy in promoting a better culture. 
That seems really inexpensive. Are those prices for within a single Bitcoin bank like Coinbase (i.e., where it’s just a ledger change and not an on-the-chain transfer)?

Ha. Not an unreasonable request. That said, the min transfer fee for BTC (as of last I checked) was worth about four lattes on its own. Given that this article earned me $0, I'd much prefer to eat my losses in cash, where what I pay goes to the recipient's immediate benefit.

Edit requested. May take a day or so. I gave you a shout-out in the correction notice in the bottom. 
I can try to send you a Euro-denominated card? I really do take accuracy seriously, and I appreciate the opportunity to both fix my mistakes and reward those who call my attention to them.

Huh. Checks out. Didn’t realize that those transactions were handled off-chain. I’ll correct the article (I’m the OP). I’m a big believer in fact-checking and being as accurate as possible. When someone brings something to light that I got wrong, I like to reward them for advancing the cause of accurate information. So if you DM me your email, I’ll happily send you a Starbucks gift card for pointing this out.

Forbes is really hit and miss. Same with Quora. The best content is really excellent. But you really need to treat each piece on a per basis. Some writers care deeply about quality and accuracy. Some just like getting clicks. Same as with any platform, whether fuelled by contributors or journalists. (Journalists should be better, but editorial budgets are at all-time lows, so plenty of junk gets through at all but the best outlets.)
Good to know re: transaction fees. If I get around to setting up a wallet, I’ll PM you and send a few satoshis your way.

In which way is that wrong?
