Sounds right. USD withdrawal problems started just as price exploded.
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:27:02
That works until it doesn't.

Interesting points. I agree but I turned very pessimistic about Bitcoin. I don't see any recovery at all. Ever. There are better alternatives already and I'm afraid Bitcoin will get killed by something better next few years. One example: Look at next diff; if price continues down and diff continues up Bitcoin will become unusable at some point where miners decide it's enough and pull the plug. Blocks will take days and diff adjustment months. Bitcoin will be hard-forked but it will be too late. IMO we are experiencing a black swan event in Bitcoin. I hope I'm wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:02:07
That's why it's a Black Swan. No one expects it and it never happened before. I don't expect it either but possibility for that scenario is higher than ever.

Did you use second password? 
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:47:19
You should really include [Diceware]( link for password section. It's simple, safe and noob friendly way to make pass-phrases.
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:47:14

:) Always like to hear a successful investing story. Congrats and good luck in future too, I suggest reading some books on investing and money management in your spare time.
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:19:46
Big mistake! You should have bought 12. So you can spend those extra 2 coins one day and still have nice big round number left :)
@_date: 2013-11-05 09:49:21
I just thought about this and I think actually Bitcoin needs a bank. To many noobs out there careless about their security. Online wallet with some insurance company behind and real business to sue if they lose your coins. Then they will put mandatory security measures like 2FA for their users due to insurance. Blockchain.info is not really anything like that because you own private keys. Newbies and careless people will likely lose every private key they can get their hands on.
Btw I think this is FUD. Every time BTCUSD rallies someone lose their savings on reddit.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:39:49
That's what I meant. I use online Electrum to send txs and offline Electrum to sign them. I guess downloading latest tarball and running this would do? 


@_date: 2013-11-11 13:54:44
I did some simple math and **if** demand for bitcoin = demand for gold,  I got to $41666 per Bitcoin until next halving of reward. But markets are never rational so price jump would probably factor-in future difficulty too. So lets round it to $100k. Add some more for bubbles: $200-300k is possible. At that point $1 billion of bitcoin would be mined every day until next halving. But who says value of USD will stay at these levels? QE to eternity.
@_date: 2013-09-10 00:45:22
Yeah with leverage you have to calculate in advance your potential losses or you could end up with big and quick losses... or profits lol. I've tried BTC.sx and didn't like them because of fees and I just don't like that interface. But I didn't notice any price manipulation. 
Currently I use: bitfinex 4:1 leverage, 1broker.com 5:1 and 796.com has 2:1. Also there's Plus500 (10:1) for fiat. Note that at bitfinex and 796.com trading is done with other traders which is better imho.
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:21:59
You can use brain wallets safely IF you use something like 10 word diceware password . 
@_date: 2013-09-17 01:11:45
It's really easy - add a folder, add a key and you're synced with your other computer(s). As long as they're both online they will sync. Mobile app is similar to dropbox app where you download only what you need. For offsite storage cheap vps could be used or something like that. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 08:00:47
You say it's from reddit? What sites did you visit? What did you click there? Look at your browser history if you can't remember. What security addons do you use? Did you check system logs? Use clam-av to scan your system. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 19:25:29
thanks for 1broker.com, didn't know about that one - looks good
@_date: 2013-06-03 12:37:55
Every new listing on bitmit is a small and no cost contribution to stick it up to both ebay and paypal one day!
@_date: 2013-10-21 08:07:58
Have to agree. When bitcoin price is shooting up anything like this can be just FUD because there are lot of people butt hurt selling/shorting bitcoin or bought a bag of altcoins or simply want price down to buy more. Just look at btc-e chat lol.
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:20:16
Because with companies like bitpay you have nothing to lose as you can receive usd and accept payments in btc.
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:15:54
Just encrypt your important stuff.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:18:21
True. There are no old day traders.
@_date: 2013-10-30 08:40:12
I'd recommend middlecoin.com. It mines altcoins like litecoin and pays you in bitcoins.

How to properly upgrade offline wallets on Ubuntu?
@_date: 2013-06-28 10:05:06
Maybe better to compare US with EU. 20-something countries in EU.
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:33:03
You can  scan the barcode. But it's a hassle if you're moving coins a lot like me. Now I use offline Electrum for cold storage and its perfect for me.
@_date: 2013-08-29 14:07:29
Seems like those coins were moving around on 16.04.2013. If I'm correct that is the day of highest MtGox volume of almost 600k and also the lowest price days after this year crash.  Interesting.
@_date: 2013-08-23 14:51:19
If you're new to margin trading please try Plus500 or 796.com for leveraged trading on bitcoins. This one is confusing as hell. Daily fee should be 0.1% (already expensive). But my calc says almost 0.4%. Expensive!

For sure? How do you know that? All the OP provided was a screenshot of firefox upload file dialog. It can be just a bug in firefox or ubuntu for all we know. I'd like to know what site did he visit that he thinks did this and look at its page source.

If you create a new offline 1.9 wallet, can't you just send coins there? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:50:53
Aaaaaah I'm stupid. I can't find any binary executable in downloaded tar.gz or zip. Do you mean there is a .bin file or something in the archive?
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:50:37
All you need is a seed phrase. But why believe me? Try it will small amounts.
@_date: 2013-11-01 14:22:50
Exactly. Rich guys, or at least some of them, don't care so much about profits (they are rich already). They care about protecting wealth. This will be perfect for them.
@_date: 2013-11-05 11:21:16
Hm. That sucks without backups. Then safest way to restore without backups would be using ubuntu live cd/usb to send to a new offline 1.9 wallet as soon as seed is entered.
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:46:30
Yes. I would do it that way and then send all bitcoins to a completely new offline wallet. Note that you need to restore from seed only if you don't have electrum.dat backup.
@_date: 2013-10-26 15:51:19
Why the hell would someone buy something on auction only to dump at market later? And probably by that time ETFs will be allover bitcoin so most likely some big fund will buy them with no intention of selling anytime soon.

I was comparing e-gold to liberty reserve but I don't think that was the post I replied to..

Most likely maybe.
@_date: 2013-10-25 08:53:49
Indeed. Earlier post was 7 months ago when bitcoin was rallying up. And now again just in time when bitcoin is rallying again. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 16:56:12
only til the end of this month I think
edit: yup 


@_date: 2013-09-17 00:59:15
Voted few months ago, but its too late for dropbox now: Since I found [Bittorrent Sync](
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:17:56
Dropbox is closed source too AND on top of that all files are stored there for them free to see.

Bitcoin credit cards will come eventually. Together with charge back possibilities. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 11:41:16
Why not gloat? Not everything is about usd exchange rate. Those kind of fuckers are dismissing everything they see or hear that is new without doing slightest research about things. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:35:30
What I did was: Installed Ubuntu, downloaded Electrum, installed as per guide on download page and then disconnected forever before creating new wallet.

According to github restore in offline mode is fixed:
# Release 1.9.1
* fix regression with --offline mode
* fix regression with --portable mode: use a dedicated directory
@_date: 2013-10-13 17:39:12
Yes, it costs only a few minutes to deploy few dozen wallet.dat files over 30 PCs. Mostly under administrator user if users are not trusted. After that I actually have nothing to do. And potential reward is enormous: Discovering and locating network penetration early.
@_date: 2013-09-02 15:04:49
Been there too. Besides (re)downloading the blockchain what actually annoyed me the most was constant running to computer with bitcoin client to send tx. These days I just use blockchain.info wallet for small amounts/daily usage and paper wallets for any savings.

Plus500.com is bigger (recently listed on LSE) and you can trade bitcoin 24/7. Excellent news for Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:34:28
Aaaaand you just fed the bots with one more language lol. Just use diceware. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 07:04:07
You can also short for fiat at plus500.com, but not from U.S . That said I wouldnt recommend shorting btc . Ever.
@_date: 2013-11-05 08:59:22
Use offline Electrum or Armory solution in future. And small amounts online for daily use. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:22:22
He did nothing wrong. He didn't have any coins. You can prevent this from happening  to you in future by buying some today.

Another feature of bitcoin! I have bitcoin wallets loaded with small amounts on company's computers as an additional security measure so I can detect really fast if any of computers are compromised. All I have to do is monitor the addresses. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:27:57
Me too. I was previously semi-paranoid about security, but since I got into bitcoin it has reached a whole different level lol.
