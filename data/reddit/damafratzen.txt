When I bought the BTC+The money arrived BTC was at 14k, now it's at 19k and I bet they will just give me less than what I paid for if they ever decide to actually send my order. This is a joke and after such a long time of them not communicating at all I believe I'm free to complain...
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:54:23
The reason I'm impatient is: when you place an order via SEPA you are informed that the amount of BTC sent will be recalculated before beeing sent. Since I placed my order the price has increased by a lot and I'm not really willing to get a smaller amount of BTC just because they are currently "overwhelmed". 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:01
They actually cancelled my order today and gave me credits instead. And since the price is dropping now I guess thats good for me.
Just a bit annoyed that it took them so long.

What is this, if it's not a scam? I've paid for my order, they recieved my money but the order status stays at 1/5. 
That may be a technical issue but such things can be resolved, which is why I contacted them (Via twitter and email) but they don't seem to give a shit. 
So you're telling me that me sending them lots of money and getting nothing in return is not a scam?
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:38:36
It's exactly the same for me. I was hoping someone from litebit would reply here on reddit since they've done it in the past but it seems like they aren't communicating at all...
Great company, if this doesn't get resolved soon I'm going to contact my bank and see if I can get my money back somehow. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:20:48
Yes, I am fully verified and this wasn't my first order with this bank account. 
This was the highest order I've ever placed and now they're not sending my BTC or doing anything at all.

"if everything stays like it is right now we won't ever need bigger blocks"
"won't for a long time."
You just repeated what I said, it won't need bigger blocks now, but in the future. 
Besides, the main use for bigger blocks right now is to make a better impression during the next bullrun so there's more time for LN to be 'finished'.
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:05:48
Well, on one hand that is true, and I don't want a bcash scenario. (the blocksize is actually the least bad thing about bcash, but thats besides the point). 
BTC will have to find the right balance, and 1mb definitely is not enough. Not even if 99% of transactions are done through LN. 
Most people who use BTC won't ever run a node, nor know how to even do that. And by lifting the blocksize just a bit you won't push anyone off.
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:30:08
Even LN needs bigger blocks, at least if you look at the bigger picture. 
Of course, if everything stays like it is right now we won't ever need bigger blocks but that isn't really the goal is it?
If BTC ever gets more users, the blocksize has to be increased, even if it is just for the sole purpose of allowing more LN channels to be opened at once. 
Decentralization won't suffer from an increase, as long as it stays reasonable. The people who actually want to run a node have the resources available. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:40:42
I personally care about speed and cost, but I care even more about adoption and the decentralization of the blockchain. 
BTC beats BCH and any altcoins in that regard.
It's the original, and I'd rather improve the original than switch over to an alternative that's controlled by shady people/companies. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:47:19
Well, segwit effectively doubles the blocksize. So segwit + a increase to 4mb would mean '8mb' worth of transactions which would be a pretty good solution imo.

You dont fully understand redeeming Tether. They don't pay you the exchange rate, they give you 1$ for each tether. It's an easy way to make money for rge exchanges that are actually able to redeem Tethers.
If Tether only gave you 0,97$ for each Tether, they would practically admit that Tether isnt backed 1:1.

Replace LTC with XMR and we're good. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:40:13
IMO:   BTC, ETH and XMR all have a right to coexist. They are unique and serve different purposes.

If you look at bitmex, you will find one person shorting BTC with 10 mil over and over again since around 7180. Roughly every 10 mins, if it doesn't stop now we'll probably see 6,5k.
/Allthough 6,7k seems good and we'll likely go up from here.

Some whales madee good use of the bad news and shorted BTC all the way down to 6700 starting from 7200.
Was watching it myself on Bitmex, multiple shorts worth 10-12 million that were closed just minutes after and then immediatly reopened. 
//The orders weren't hidden, so many people saw them and also pissed themselves. The chain reaction just made it faster. 
PSA: If you let whales fuck around with you don't do trades and just hold or stay away from BTC. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 02:24:47
Drop already happened way before you posted this. Went from 6750 to 6550.

I like how your comment is structured. 
\[I will get censored, bad sub\] \[Get BCH instead of BTC\] \[I will get censored\]
Did you ever think about just staying on topic and not trashing this sub with your useless spam? Maybe thats the reason MODERATORS MODERATE (delete) your comments. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:28:44
I don't think it's a bad time to buy now, unless you're planning to open a position with 4x or more leverage. It CAN still drop, but it kept stable after the crash, so I think the downtrend is over for now. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:56:03
Theres no way to stop it if the transaction was already sent. // If theres a tx ID your money is gone. If not try contacting coinbase asap, don't know if their support can help you fast enough tho. 
I didn't think people were actually falling for those scams, it's way too obvious.

" the authors found that tether was used to buy bitcoin at key moments when it was declining"
Hmmmmm, what could potentially be the reason people buy Bitcoin when the price is declining?
I always thought you have to buy high and sell low?
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:16:34
We're going sideways for now. From here it's either up or down to 6,5k (give it a few hours).
If the 6,5k support breaks tho..... Let's not talk about that scenario.

You / The community / The miners.
A hardfork could change the max amount.
