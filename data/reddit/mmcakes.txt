It's not a strawman if you can't explain why it's a strawman. This seems to be perfectly in line with anarcho capitalistic principles, but if it's not, then please explain how it's not.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:29:40
Wow, the irony here is intense. Over and over you're arguing against various straw men and the whole reason this thread started was because that's what you were accusing someone else of doing.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:28:15
Wow, you completely missed the point. OP and I were not talking about Bitcoin, we were talking about unregulated exchanges, i.e. ramps into Bitcoin. Of course I understand the principles  that  underpin Bitcoin (been here since '13). It seems it is you who has built the strawman.
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:50:26
Lmao. You clearly don't understand what is and isn't a strawman and the language (and grammar) you're using to rant only makes you look like a child. Good luck with that.

Care to explain any of your three assertions, each of which is wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:10:38
That all makes a lot of sense. Thanks. Are you putting in your stops immediately or watching the screen for a few minutes to confirm the trend. I could see why you might want to back out of a trade earlier if things don't go as plan immediately after you buy in.
Also, do you follow hard and fast rules for the stops or do you get emotional and irrational like I do? :/
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:15:47
But I think the expectation is that the investors will hedge with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:02:44
No, I don't see it that way. The reason the price is volatile is because we're still in very early adoption phase. The market cap needs to settle at the appropriate level. I personally think that level is much much higher than it currently sits at ~$200 Billion. There will always be profit takers but the margins will decrease with time and the whales either won't exist in the same way or won't attempt to abuse the markets in the same way.

You fundamentally don't understand what confirmation biases are. You are extrapolating from a few anecdotal cases on the internet. If you don't think money problems can drive someone to suicide, you are very naive.

Great advice and it's much appreciated. I've hedl since 13' for the most part (after losing 30% panic selling and buying at the wrong times on Dec 10th). I didn't really understand what margin trading was until recently, but as soon as I learned about it I knew that taking long positions at the right time with the right amount/leverage is a great way to make some money. 
First few trades I made were around the 12K-13K mark and were mostly washes or small loses, I stopped everything out pretty quickly once my hands started to sweat at a -1% P/L. 
A few days ago I was convinced that I could make this my sole source of income, given that I ~~have~~ had a decent stack and the numbers I was seeing in the profit column were way more than I was earning on a daily basis at my previous job. I still think this is possible, but after being burned, I know I need to risk a lot less money in the short term and actually **learn** what I'm doing before making any more significant moves. I'm confident I can earn my coins back but I'm wary of falling for a gambler's mentality. 
Your point on profits is really poignant. I have found myself up 2%, 3% or even 12% in the past few days ($100,000 + profit) only to repeat my mantra of:


This mentality is toxic as it's leading to bad trades and non-stop anxiety while staring at the screen (unless I'm up, then it's confidence, arrogance and happiness). It's amazing how this has consumed my life over the past few weeks. Life was easier as a hodler.
I still want to trade but I need to really dive into the resources and learn what I'm doing. Your advice has been very helpful. Do you have a book that you'd recommend on candlestick trading and how much faith do you put into candles (and which candles?)?
Thanks again for taking the time to respond in full.

You don't understand scarcity then. Bitcoin is a naturally deflationary currency and cannot be inflated as there are a limited number of supply and the demand far outpaces the ever-decreasing rate of inflation. Your argument doesn't make sense and you refuse to clarify. Additionally, the Lightning Network will be released in a short time and will solve the everyday currency issue. 
Just typical brigading. Go be sad you missed the boat years ago somewhere else.

It's more than that when everyday people's earnings are at stake.

I said he was neither of the 3 things I listed, indicating that he had no connection or authority to speak on the topic. End of story. I didn't claim anything like what you are saying I did. I already clarified this too, so I just don't get why your rambling on.

In terms of the hammer, which candles do you look for this on. I'm familiar what to look for and understand the reasoning behind it but I've not been sure on which time scale to look for it in terms of BTC. I would assume a 1m hammer doesn't mean much, given the likelihood of low volume and low sample size during that minute.
I'll check out the book. Thanks for the recommendation.

@_date: 2017-12-10 18:04:16
Again, much appreciated. I do see that hammer on the 1d and it's visible on Bitfinex as well, all though the tail is less pronounced. 
What are your thoughts on Bitfinex/Bitstamp vs GDAX convergence/divergence over the past few days? At one point there was a greater than $1000
difference but that has since been reduced to $200-$300. I would assume the difference was due to BTC network congestion and lack of arbitrage coupled with new entrants signing up for Coinbase and buying out the book at record pace. Do you think the fact that Bitstamp and Bitfinex have largely caught up has any bearing on the price?
When you're day trading the 15m chart, are you primarily looking at MACD trends or volume spikes or buy/sell walls or something else entirely? How do you judge what the total value of each swing is and how do you decide what is enough of a swing to be worth it and was isn't (if you're paying .1% on each side of the trade plus interest, anything less than .5% seems pointless and even that seems much lower than would be worth one's time) Also, what sort of volatility signs do you look for that indicate the swings are going to continue as opposed to breaking one direction or the other?
Lastly, I would not act solely on a stranger's advice on the internet and would never attempt to hold another person responsible for my own financial decisions. I appreciate the insight into your strategy and am learning a lot. Thanks again.

You are free to leave. I hear Somalia is practically stateless.
And no, I do not find that principle "messed up". You wouldn't "own" anything without the government enforcing property rights. And don't give me that bullshit that improving land equates to ownership. By that logic, we should give all the land back to the Indians. Is that what you want?

No, it's like saying you are Apple if you have stock in Apple. Actually it's like if everyone owned the same percentage of Apple - each shareholder would have equal influence over the actions of the company. This is how government works, except with votes instead of stocks/money. Everyone has only one vote. Unfortunately money has corrupted the system in the United States, but the accountability is still there, just to a lesser degree. We need campaign finance reform so that corporations can't bankroll politicians and participate in crony capitalism. You would be wise to look at systems in other countries, as democracy tends to work better elsewhere.

How would a stateless society prevent these problems? It wouldn't because people are still motivated by their own self-interest and will cut others down if they can derive benefit from doing so.

Why won't you take a stance on free will? It's a simple yes or no question and it's the most relevant point at hand. Like they say - anarchists moralize, liberals rationalize. If you believe in free-will then you will blame the individual for faults. It you don't, then you blame the conditions. 
Collecting taxes as they are currently collected is not the only way for the government to exercise control. Control can and does exist in other forms. For instance, the government can visit a farm and take a portion of the food. Property taxes would also still be entirely enforceable. Etc.

No, I'm certainly for taxing that money though. What do you mean "coming down to hard"? The US has a very low tax rate (especially for the rich) compared to other developed countries.


What type of thinking is that? Freedom from what? Many people consider freedom to be the freedom to live without worrying about food security, water access and healthcare access. You anarchists define freedom very narrowly ("What's mine is mine!"). Thank Marx only a small number of you exist on the fringe.


No, show me where Satoshi said he hated the government. He never did. He said Bitcoin would appeal to the libertarian crowd. If anything, he hated the banking industry (private sector!), which I do too.

The free market is unwilling to extend service if profit is not there. For instance, the rural farm towns around where I live do not have access to broadband because it's not profitable for companies to expand service to these towns. The **government** is now taking the helm and installing fiber all over. Thanks Obama!


Medicare outperforms private health insurance. Single payer in other countries outperforms by even greater margins. Private industry only operates in the name of profit. Most of us don't want to conflate profit with things like healthcare, education or environmental protection. These things are better handled by a democratic institution that is accountable to all of its constituents. 


Again, taxes are not extortion. If you participate in the economy that the gov't fosters, you are obligated to pay taxes. Otherwise, you are free to leave or not work.

Which accusation was wild? The one about the tea party not liking the president because he's black? I think that's a pretty reasonable assessment as a lot of the birthers, benghazi nuts, etc are tea party members. Also his point about the tea party members being absent during previous president's deficit spending is also true. To deny that racism is still rampant in this country is naive at best.

Licensing is just one form of regulation. Calling your reasoning "straightforward logic" does not make it sound.

@_date: 2014-01-06 23:34:27
You clearly lack an elementary understanding of physics. Things don't just happen for no reason. Your actions are determined by chemical reactions in your body, not by some magical "free-will". If there is free-will, where does it come from? Do apes have free will? Dogs? Cats? Rats? Insects? Bacteria? Where in the evolutionary timeline did this remarkable trait develop? We are just complex biological machines. Our "decisions" are only determined by our genetics and external stimuli. This is why you can't send an electrical signal to an area of a patients brain and they will raise their arm. 
I am not assigning blame to someone else. I am merely saying that people behave the way they do because of who they are and the nature of the situation at hand. If you made an exact duplicate of this universe 1 million times over, that person would make the same decision each time (barring the effects of quantum uncertainty). I can understand why somebody who fallaciously believes in free-will would assign 'blame'. But I assure you that if you educated yourself and learned some rudimentary physics and biochemistry, you would change your mind. You are merely ignorant when it comes to biological science - most anarchists are. I don't *blame* you for this though. You probably had shitty parents who didn't instill the importance of science when you were developing. And they probably had shitty parents as well. There is simply no way to "blame" someone if they had no choice in the matter. This does not mean that we cannot justify discipline though - this is still important for reasons of deterrence.

**I didn't say I blame others**, I said that science blames the conditions. Free-will is what anarchists hang their hat on all of the time, but it simply is not a valid concept. I'm sorry that you are a denier of science. I'm sure you reject evolution too. Unfortunately for you, science is the only real things in this world. Everything else are just human constructs (including free-will).
That's great that you're having a good life. Many are not. Are you going to blame a kid in the inner-city for slinging dope even though this is all he's known his entire life? If you were in his shoes (with his brain), you'd be making the same "decisions".

Taxation is not *about* coercion. Taxation is about collecting revenue based on a percentage of your economic activity.

You may not like what they are used for, just like you may not like having to play goalie on your soccer team, but it's still teamwork.

That's not what I said at all. I simply identified (correctly) that free-will is an illusion. Anarchists base their arguments around choice and freedom, but if choice doesn't exist, then their arguments are not sound. I do not think government should control everything, I think that heavy taxes for the rich, a very strong safety net and quality universal health care and education are the key to a successful society. By the way, the countries with policies like this (Scandinavia, etc.) are the best in the world (education outcomes, life expectency, happiness metrics). Anarchy/Libertarianism has an awful track record (Somalia?).

Taxes on expats are a different matter. I'm not against it on principle, but I don't know enough about this implementation to comment.

"The State" did not massacre the Indians, a mob of dissenters did. The State is just a natural formation of society. There are limited resources and people will fight over them so we need a system to manage these resources safely and fairly. A democratic government is the best method at this point for doing so. Governments would form spontaneously from anarchist societies - they are natural. You can't honestly believe that an anarchist society would be a utopia with no disputes. Or maybe you're delusional and can believe such a thing. Either way it's a pipe dream.

Are you thick in the head? Government involvement is not a binary choice. There are varying levels. I'm not saying government should involve itself in every aspect of society.


So you're saying that you *do* believe in free will? I would urge you to read up on the subject. Physics, neuroscience and genetics demonstrate that free-will is an illusion. This is the scientific view but I can tell that you're more of the emotional type. You should try putting more faith into science and empiricism.

@_date: 2014-02-28 14:37:43
You should work on your reading comprehension skills. I never said or implied that the most pragmatic solutions would come from the state. But when you are vehemently anarchist, you outright deny that the state provides services that would otherwise be unavailable or would discriminate against certain populations. Sometimes the state provides the best option. Anarchists argue based on morality, not on pragmatics.

I said a large percentage, not a majority. The early members of this sub are rabid anarchists and have probably already put in their downvotes.

What you're suggesting is that a group of people would create their own state. If the worst thing about a stateless society is that a state might form, I think that's a pretty good deal.
What? You're okay with a state so long as it forms from anarchy? How about late 18th century United States? Or all of the revolutions over the years and fresh constitutions? These events should be right up your alley.

No, we're talking about taxes in general. All the anarchists in this thread refer to taxes using buzzwords like *extortion*. Their argument (and presumably yours) is that taxes are immoral. This "morality" argument is entirely subjective and most people disagree with anarchist sentiments. In terms of taxing expats, the intentions are clear - to raise revenue. Taxes in the US are at a historic low and the rich have lobbied to avoid any tax increases. Compare the United States against other, more successful countries (Sweden, Iceland, Germany, Denmark, etc.) and you'll see that we are vastly undertaxed.

The only reason Paul has the faintest footing in this election cycle is because a good portion of our country are gun touting card carrying members of confederate traditions. The rest of the world has moved on. That's why social programs are even more popular elsewhere. Anarchist policies will never persist in a globalized world.

Yeah that's what I said.. What's your point?


Big ol' red herring.


Again this is a counterfactual argument and isn't even relevant to the question about why you would need a gun in the 21st century and why rely on an antiquated part of the constitution to justify owning a gun? It makes no sense.


Because it's largely not true and there's plenty of data points that demonstrate the opposite argument and the opposite argument can be (and is) made using the same time periods and countries. It's pointless to try to reason with gun activists though because, typically, the love for guns runs about as deep as possible and there's little room for reason on compromise. 
I still implore you to explain how the second amendment is at all relevant to modern day America or why other countries get by just fine without the equivalent right? Are you under threat of government tyranny? Is a gun going to help in that scenario? Mind explaining why *gun* violence creates so many causalities in the US and why the US has about 5x the [homicide rate]( of most other developed countries (including UK and Australia)? 
Your argument doesn't make much sense and relies completely on cherry picking incomplete data sets. Still though, I want to hear the argument for why owning a gun in the 21st century should be considered a *right*.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:03:50

Lol, now you've gone full-blown retard.


I'm American and love America but there are good reasons to lambaste and ridicule Americans and the American government. For one, we elected one of the most self-centered, egotistical, anti-intellectual people ever to higher office. We have a fat president who claims to be a 'stable genius,' but can't help himself from contradicting himself constantly and making himself look like an uneducated crybaby on Twitter just about every single cay. The US is great *despite* our failings, not because of them. You're clearly a bit of a snowflake yourself and represent the worst of what this country has to offer.

What government needs is transparency. I still fail to see how your hypothetical system wouldn't breed government automatically. Either government structures would natural form out of people's desire for equality or we would devolve into a feudal state? Is feudalism what you want?

Lucky for me, studies show that the U.S. population is become more socialist, which is what I want. Hopefully we'll catch up to other more socialist countries soon.

I know that wages have not kept up inflation. I guess we might be arguing two different points. Due to increases in efficiency and developments in technology, a higher proportion of the population today has access to premium goods (cars, sizable shelter, computers, cell phones, information). A 40-hour work week for the median income might be lower as a percentage of GDP than it was 50 years ago, but this job should still earn you better living conditions than before. Debt shouldn't really come into the equation because it isn't an issue if you can make the payments and it doesn't detract from your future quality of life. Overall, people live longer and have access to more things - that's all I'm saying.
I am not arguing that we have been screwed by the 1% and that economic inequality is out of control. These things are all true. The lower and middle class should be much better off than we are right now. But we are still better off than we were 50 years ago, even if only modestly so.
I would say debt is a separate issue because what's the difference between owning a TV of borrowing one for your whole life? the end result is the same - you have access to TV. Debt is a huge problem though and it's what keeps the 1% rich and what limits economic mobility.

That's against his property rights, according to you.


Wow, you're going to trust the private sector to handle this? What if there is ulterior motive for the court to convict the defendant? Say the defendant had a massive collection of gold (libertarians love gold!) and the court wanted to seize it in order to benefit itself and its clients? What if the court wanted to implement eugenics because they felt that black people were unproductive? What if the courts ruled that it would be best to sterilize any non-aryan citizens of the cult-boat? 
If you seriously think a society can function well without a government, I seriously worry about your mental health.

@_date: 2013-05-10 17:49:23
My argument is that the State (ideally) makes people pay for societal insurance. Voluntarism relies on the good will of people, and not everyone is nice, so the duties fall unfairly on those that are nice, creating an incentive *not* to be nice. You keep talking about the current state of the state, which is obviously not ideal. We should get corporations and money out of politics, not destroy the government. If the state can implement regulations to make ladders safer at reasonable cost, then they should do so. It's simply cost/benefit analysis and statistics.

Who decides all of this in an anarchist society?


*alluding not eluding*. So when kids are born are they expected to be completely self reliant and free to make whatever decisions they want? Should young kids be allowed to run away or carry a gun?


True, the government is basically the biggest gang because it is elected through democratic means. The difference is that the mafia is not a democratic organization.


You might define happiness differently if you were born an orphan and relied on the safety net to reach adulthood.

The price will need to be $42,250 and market cap $500,000,000,000 by the end of 2014 in order to see the same returns on investment. Certainly possible, but the next year the price would have to be $2.7 mil/BTC to have the same returns. My point is that the market cap with not keep growing exponentially - this why there is significantly less room now.

The government should control pollution because everyone is affected by it. Also which company would you sue? How do you know which companies are polluting, especially if you don't have access to their facilities? Governments do have greater access then any person. Are you saying that people should be allowed to infiltrate any business and perform their own investigation? Where does the accountability come from? Maybe I've got a big pile of tires burning in my back yard but my property is so big that nobody notices. I'm still polluting? Also, how would the courts be funded? What if you couldn't afford representation? How could privatized courts possibly be fair to both parties? Especially when there is no governing body to regulate their behavior and finances? What if one of the parties disagreed with the court or refused to go to court all together? People should be free to not go to court, right?


Yes, the current system is like this. But to deny there are solutions is naive. Public finance reform, removing the filibuster, reversing citizen's united, etc. would all be ways in which people can take back control of their government.

That is not logical. Just because almost everyone supports the government doesn't mean that they were brainwashed. Perhaps you were brainwashed by anarchists into believing that the government is inherently tyrannical. Most people want the government to exist and to be paid for fairly.

I agree with all of that except for the conflation of banks and government. Banks and crony capitalism are the issue here, not government itself. The number of public sector jobs isn't really an important metric because those jobs could accomplish important tasks that are not handled by private industry (environmental cleanup, basic research, health care regulation, etc.). The size of government isn't the problem, it's the activities that the government participates in that is. 
I'm not sure I would go as far as saying that complete monetary failure is inevitable or soon to happen, but there are a lot of issues  with the current feudal-esque system we're in. Unlike you (guessing here), I think that government intervention needs to play a big role here and heavily tax the wealthy and give back to the citizens via massive infrastructure improvements (education, roads, research grants).

Income has risen by a similar rate, so it isn't like we're worse off now. In fact, living standards have improved and efficiencies have allowed most people to afford what were once luxuries (cars, computers, etc.). We're almost certainly better off today, even though inequality is much higher now.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:35:36


If you're a monopoly, you have 100% of the market share and can set prices arbitrarily.


It's less effective because we have laws that deter criminal behavior. The government does not go around harassing people with "violence". There is a set of laws in this democracy that dictate how the government can and cannot act. If there were no laws or government then "private" violence would be a lot more viable.


Again, one entity monopolizing a precious resource still needs resources itself. It cannot function without cooperating with the rest of the market for the resources it needs. That's the beauty of a truly free market. It ties all of society's self-interest together so that my best interest is your best interest. Legitimized violence does exactly the opposite of this, pitting different entities' self-interest against each other leading to war and other incredible inefficiencies.
Nope. Especially not when you have a ford of currency. Step one: sell water for bitcoin. Step two: buy whatever with bitcoin. People are not going to turn down money just because it's coming from the water lord.


So then property rights are not valid? People can just form a mob and steal the reservoirs from their owner? Also, a society working together for their common interest sounds a lot... like... a democratic government. It comes full circle. Government would emerge naturally in an anarchist society.

A lot of Libertarians around here claim that completely removing of government from society is the only means of achieving freedom. This is one way of envisioning freedom, but not everyone subscribes to this definition and some people value safety and wellbeing as freedom. Max Keiser seems to be a go to figure around here for rallying Libertarians to quote of circlejerk around. I'm not claiming all Libertarians are like this, but it seems that many are. Maybe I'm directing this towards the wrong group - is probably worse. Can you explain your take on Libertarianism? Since Americans have hijacked the term and applied it to right wing extremism, it's hard to tell what people mean when they say it these days. I'm a Libertarian in the original sense and I support the idea of government regulations on corporations and I support progressive taxes. Does this ideology fall within your definition of Libertarianism?

@_date: 2013-05-14 04:50:53
Ok a lot of this sounds very reasonable.  I agree with a lot of your points but I still reach a different conclusion when examining the arguments. I think that you're right in identifying the issues present in today's states, but I don't think these problems stem from the idea of the state itself. Perhaps in the future complete stateless societies will be the most prosperous, but until humankind reaches a new level of kindness, I think that the state is necessary in coercing the public into progressing. I disagree with the robery analagy, given that this country is a democratic republic.  I also disagree with your ideas of property rights. But overall you articulate anarchist merits well and I've got to concede some points to you (moral objection to war). I think we both want freedom to be maximized, but we see different paths towarda that goal. Thanks for actually debating, unlike so many others in this thread.

Taxation is not theft. That's absolutely absurd. How else does the government get money? It's either print it or take a portion of it from the economy.

I disagree. Perhaps the state is in less control of digital materials, but physical commodities are under greater state supervision today than ever before. Just because counterfeit goods sometimes come through shipping ports doesn't mean that the State doesn't have the ability to open containers and regulate any imports. Can you provide any examples of non-black market physical goods that are out of reach of the state?
(most) People naturally want the state to provide invaluable services to everyone in society. If the state collapsed from lack of funding, a new state would inevitably be erected to take its place. Anarchists always talk about states having a monopoly on violence, so what do spending power have to do with it? If the state fell, whichever gang happened to control the majority of violent power would become the defacto government. Look at what happened in Egypt. I would much rather rely on a democratic system than be under the control of the largest gang or military.

We don't have a democracy. We have a democratic republic, a constitution and a supreme court that is designed to stop oppression of the minority. Without the supreme court, the free market would still be operating with black slaves. It's appalling to credit profit with motivating people to be fair and nice to other people.
 I agree public schools need to be reformed and restructured, but the solution is not to privatize them. We need to get special interests (PROFIT) out of Washington so that the government officials can be incentivized to vote for the benefit of their constituents. We need smarter government, not no government.

Most people don't hold that view. It's really as simple as that.

Those are all studies that show current gun control measures aren't working. They do not show that less guns result in less crime. It is hard to demonstrate something like this being the case because there are several variables to control for. Correlation studies also leave much to be desired. Correlation =/= causation. I would argue that banning all guns (particularly handguns and automatic weapons) would reduce the number of suicides and homicides in this country dramatically. Hard to say what exactly would happen though since it's hypothetical. All of this is beside the point though because the real problem here is that banning people from owning guns can be justified by a different definition of freedom. If people choose to define freedom as freedom from violence, then guns can be banned in the name of freedom - contradictory to what many here imply.

I don't have strict views either way. I think every problem requires debate and analysis to determine the best way forward. Sometimes I support strong government intervention and control and other times I support more free-market types of solutions. It's the struggle between government, capital and labor that creates forward thinking progress, imo.

What about the company that owns all of the reservoirs? They can charge whatever they like because they have control over all of the drinking water. Monopolies have nothing to do with the government, except when the government is breaking them up. It's amazing that someone would prefer to privatize something as public as drinking water. The government is much better suited to handle something like this.

See, right here you use the language 'tyrant' and use that word to conclude that your anti-'tyranny' sentiment is natural superior. If you frame the debate using the word 'protector' then your logic falls apart. Please don't abuse language to create logical fallacies. It does nothing to inform the debate.


Again, most people don't see this as tyranny. You can't just say that it is just because you used that word.

That's one way to look at it. But (most) laws are not designed to encourage violence, in fact many are designed to quell violent and unruly citizens. Is this accomplished via the "threat of violence"? Sure, but I don't see how that is immoral. If there is a mad arsonist on the loose, don't you want the police to capture and punish him? Isn't deterrence the primary utility in prosecution?

You didn't even respond to the fact that UPS and Fedex don't deliver to some places.

They are responsible for protecting the citizens of this country and that means law enforcement, schools, research funding, policies to incentivize protecting the environment, etc. The free market will not protect the elderly or veterans and they won't help poor people because that's not where the profit is.

It takes more than internet and ability to understand to invest. You have to have find out about bitcoin is and have some means of exchanging your currency for it. I'm sure bitcoins would improve the status of developing countries in the distant future. But initially, it seems that early adopters (mostly in developed countries) will hold a substantial amount of the wealth. This is, of course, assuming that bitcoin takes off.

Not necessarily. There is nothing stopping two currencies from existing alongside each other. It's already happening...

It's refreshing to see a libertarian here articulate a good point. I agree that if you are morally opposed, than it is a binary condition. However, since many people would rebuild a government if it fell, would you try and prevent these people from recreating the government? Aren't you infringing on their right to come together and form a government? Why is it not their right to do this? 
Compromise is what it's all about. So even if you are morally opposed to government, you are pragmatically in support of it. So long as anti-gov't groups make a tiny percentage of the population of a democracy, governments won't go away completely. So in truth, you aren't extremely opposed to government in a practical sense. What is your alternative to a democracy?
edit: oops hit save by accident.. I believe that the government should provide public goods and needs, such as education, transportation, baseline health care, etc. The market can provide luxuries but should be taxed for externalities. That's not an extreme view, why is it less worthy than yours?

You don't have to participate in the economy, therefore nobody is forcing you to pay taxes. Taxes are required because they've been essential to the success of the country. They funded World War II, they educate children in school, they fund courts which protect minorities and our rights. We pay taxes because our country is a community and taxes serve as a way to keep things fair between different classes and protect the interests of the country. The constitution says we pay taxes. So get with the program or get out. Capitalism only operates on profits, Americans don't want profit in Health Care, Fire Departments or several other things that the government provides.

Seems like more of an issue with the media. A lot of the government is transparent but Americans don't look at the facts, they watch fox news and argue based on emotion.


No, again look at other countries! Can you not see that the vast majority of developed democratic countries are doing just fine?? Your complaints about American government cannot be extended to government in general because the facts don't bear that out. Government-run German police fired 85 bullets in all of 2011. Have you not travelled elsewhere? It is America that is fucked up, with half the country being religious nationalistic bigots who get tricked into voting for the obstructionist party, even though Republican policies are counter to their economic interests. Stop ignoring Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, etc. These countries are excelling under lots of government.


It's clear that you don't understand how determinism works. I can't even begin to debunk this statement because it is a house of cards.

I know next to nothing about economics but it seems that this "bubble" was just people trying to make a quick buck and not people losing confidence with bitcoin. Overall, I think confidence in bitcoin has increased a lot recently which caused some over-excitement in the market which caused it to fall a bit. I don't think this will change the overall investment into bitcoin as a currency and thus, it is good to still be holding coins right now.

Were states not around before fiat? Again, you miss the point that just because AnCaps promoted bitcoin in the beginning doesn't mean that bitcoin is inherently AnCap or that it isn't compatible with other political ideologies. AnCaps don't have a monopoly on decentralization or technology. There are plenty of ways to make bitcoin work without anarchy. For instance, each member of society could be assigned an address that their employer would pay them through. Taxes would still be collected via these transactions and the state would continue to be funded fairly. I'm tired of this "high minded" AnCap philosophy that doesn't account for other views or the apparent success of state driven societies. I think it is you who hasn't done their homework, because you can't see how Bitcoin is compatible with several forms of society.

Right, because the use of "fucking" is somehow considered civil. The point is that most people think taxation "works" and support the idea. You can't say something doesn't work and not explain what you mean.

Most of what you're saying certainly makes sense, but that isn't the "purpose" of taxes. The purpose is to fund government, which takes care of publicly owned resources. You might be right about what is happening now, but that doesn't mean that things won't turn around and it certainly doesn't mean that "government" is inherently bad. Either way, I appreciate your articulation and calm responses - many of the libertarian folks here use coarse language and spew anti-gov't hate without much substance.

Because we built this country with the understanding and agreement (majority rules) that the government should provide the foundation for a healthy and prosperous nation.


It is essential to *our modern* economy. Sure people would still trade in a free market, but there would be several issues that couldn't be solved without agreements (laws) and dispute mediators (courts).


Speak for yourself and when enough people disagree with the law, then the law changes (gay marriage). It is the private sector that lobby's for unfair laws that target the poor and minorities (drug war). We have one method of standing up to powerful corporations and that is the right to vote. 


Yeah in the wonderful land where everything is perfect, this might be true. But what about when we have exchanges that aren't friendly (bar fight, car jacking, etc). Aren't you glad there is a support service (police) in every town for these types of circumstances? You can't just cherry pick circumstances to support libertarianism - the world is rough and cruel to a lot of people.


They are popular among the poor and the middle classes. The rich do not need and do not use these programs so they do not want to pay into them. They are insurance plans which everyone must pay into.


When did I ignore this? Defense is the reason we are running deficits. Defense spending *is* throwing money away, because a massive portion of defense spending goes to private companies (Haliburton, Black Water, etc.) and into the hands of the rich. We need to drastically cut the defense budget and invest that money into education and research. 
Don't you see that all of our budget problems stem from abusive policies pushed by the 1%? We need to get money out of politics and invest in our future.

How is that a contradiction. The state protects our society and they need to be funded somehow. I've personally been helped through difficult times via state programs and I've seen others helped as well. I've also seen people neglected by the system, but that's a fault with managing the system, not with 'the system' itself.


Please cite some evidence or present some reasoning behind this. Also, even if this were true, efficiency is not always the most important factor. Sometimes it is best to sacrifice efficiency for the sake of helping marginalized factions of society. Efficiency can lead to harsh outcomes for those who fall outside of its path.


Perhaps, but it operates within a democratic society. So extrapolating and SR data to society would be a reach. I didn't get a chance to look over the other things you posted, but I will at some point. Isn't Molyneux universally riduculed in &gt;I don't think that anarchy would exist without most people having good intentions. But I think anarchy would deal with the minority that had bad intentions (thieves, murders, etc) just fine. This is why I spend a lot of my personal time trying to get those in my life to communicate feelings and needs to each other effectively. This is the foundation of understanding and peace in our society. With the majority of peaceful people, I feel like a stateless society is inevitable. If we cannot learn to be peaceful, then we can look forward to more of the same. Look into non-violent communication and unschooling if you are interested in these types of ideas.
Sure, I agree. If almost everyone had the best of intentions then I'm sure Anarchy would not be a problem. The issue is that people are naturally greedy and selfish. Even you have probably had a moment in your life where you acted unkindly to someone for selfish gain, I know I have. The state is there to step in and ensure fair outcomes in hostile situations. Is it perfect? No. Is it better than Anarchy. I think so.


First of all, classifying taxes as theft is an opinion, one that most people would disagree with. As I've said, taxes pay for several things that you probably take for granted (Food inspection, roads, etc.). If you took away these things, you would probably earn less because the economy would suffer. Therefore, being taxed 30% when you make a $100,000 salary is about equal to earning $70,000 in an Anarchist society. i.e. these things have to be paid for somehow, so it isn't really stealing.

Economics is based on scientific principles. The goal of economics is to gather a complete set of information so that accurate models can be developed and economic mechanisms can be described. Just because we're not at the point of complete understanding of the system, does not mean that it won't happen in the future. Science is the study of how the world works and economics is part of this equation. Economics is a soft science at this point because there is not a scientific consensus on the fundamentals. Once science produces a unified theory of economics, then it can be considered a hard science.
Also, it is impossible or nearly impossible to *prove* most scientific theories. Empirical evidence merely supports the conclusion by failing to disprove it. I suspect that you are not a scientist.

What does that have to do with anything? Stop changing the subject. Bitcoin has nothing to do with a stateless society. Stop conflating bitcoin and anarcho-capitalism. Anarcho-capitalism is not the only supporter of bitcoin ideals and bitcoin does not rely on anarcho-capitalism to succeed. Again, [take a look at the wikipedia article]( Bitcoin is already succeeding in non anarchist societies. Bitcoin and government are not mutually exclusive. Please stop responding to me if you aren't going to address this point. I don't need to be educated about anarcho-capitalism. I know what it is and I (like many others) don't think it's the best course of action for society.

Determinism does not discount actions and reactions. I posted the links to wikipedia because it is clear that you do not understand the fundamentals of determinism and I'm not going to write 10,000 words explaining it. People's actions do determine outcome, it's just that they don't have control over the decisions they make - genetics, environmental forces and quantum uncertainty are the deciding factors.

If 51% of people are bad, how does an anarchist society make them change their malicious behavior? They can still form groups to enforce their will.


Because it is possible to prove what you said. It would take one society operating successfully to prove that it is indeed possible to have no government. There is no such society though.


Except that the world is trending the other direction. Also, look at the countries with the best education score, standards of living, and happiness scores... they are the Scandinavian countries and Germany all with heavy handed government social intervention! :o

People just don't like the idea of strict libertarianism. The balance between free-market and socialism is where most people stand, including myself.

That is simply not a logical argument. There is no good reason for one of the members to break away from the monopoly - not if they are all sharing their artificially high prices.


Why do you throw the word "legally" in there? Is "illegal" violence less effective or prevalent? No.
You're trying to guess the motivations and mindset of the reservoir owners. Monopolies exist for a reason - because they control the market and can price gouge. Let's reimagine this scenario with one owner buying all of the reservoirs. Now there is one owner who is the sole source of drinking water. The owner can manipulate the populace however he wants because he controls such a precious resource. The people are basically slaves to the owner's decisions. The owner could poison the water and the people would have no recourse because the water is "his property" and is a "private product". This is how and why monopolies exist in the absence of government. This is why water is a public resource.

@_date: 2013-07-24 16:28:17
yes for the 10 years before 1920 that the income tax was around it was around 2%... How is this relevant. Are you advocating tax avoidance? How is it fair for some people to opt out of paying and still reap the benefits of State spending? 
How is technology making tax avoidance easier anyways? Corporations will still need to register payrolls with the state. I don't see how it changes anything besides globalizing the black market which might cause a small increase in tax avoidance by increasing underhanded transactions. 
Either way, you admit that bitcoin functions perfectly well under the control of the state, which is the only point that I was making. This demonstrates that AnCap has no place being conflated with Bitcoin because Bitcoin can function in a multitude of societies, including ones with strong state sanctions. Therefore, just because bitcoin is an anarchist's wet dream does not mean that it isn't a wet dream for liberals or socialists as well. The state can establish control using means other than printing its own money. Which brings me back to removing from the sidebar...

It happens with new products that get adopted into the mainstream. It's just that that the companies that produce these products are prone to competition and therefore the companies stocks don't follow this pattern, but the influx of money into the product follows this graph. Take cell phones for example - Early on, a small percentage of people had cell phones. Soon the trend started gaining traction and went exponential. Soon, close to 100% of the population will have a mobile device and the market will be saturated. Bitcoin (arguably) doesn't have formidable competitors, and therefore would follow this model if there was sufficient appeal.

That is another absurd argument. Here's a scenario. There are 3 farms on your cult-cruise. One year, only one farm is successful at producing food.

The next year, the farmer produces all of the food and the year after, and so on - because he no longer has competition that can compete.

Yes the state provides permits in an attempt to establish safe rates of pollution and yes there is corruption in government. But does that make government wrong for trying to regulate the damaging actions of corporations or people? I think not. Why not work to improve the way government works, instead of trying to abolish it? 


I mean that if corporations are drilling for oil at a rate that is causing great damage to the Earth and its climate, isn't it the responsibility of the government to assess these externalities and to use taxes, regulations and incentives to prevent further damage from the current path. This is what governments are supposed to do - they make decisions that are (hopefully) in the best interest of the people, including, in this case, protecting the Earth. The problem is not government itself, it's that the government is controlled by lobbyists from huge problematic industries. We need less capitalism in this case, not less government regulation.

No. The government functions based on laws which are enacted by representatives who are elected by **the people**. This means that the government is accountable to the people. Corporations are only accountable to their shareholders. A democratic government's use of force is probably the most legitimate there is since there is accountability to the entire population. You can make the claim that the majority imposes its will on the minority, but how would this be any different in an anarchist society? The majority would still hold more power and force. Transparent democratic governments w/ educated populaces is our best tool in preventing tyranny.

This is a completely plausible scenario.
Here's another scenario: A journalist discovers that an energy company is dumping chemicals into the local river. Company decides to murder journalist to protect profits. Again, very plausible scenario.

Yes because that land was improved upon through use of the economy and the food was produced using our economic infrastructure. Also, State sponsored wars (Revolutionary, Civil) helped make it so that you can have land safely and freely.

This is where you lose me. While the evidence is not conclusive, it is substantial. Your theories do not seem to match the empirical evidence.

If it's a democratically elected government, then the officials are accountable to the people.


How exactly would this work?


Haha, but you already said that democratic gov't doesn't work. Why doesn't it if the majority of people are reasonable?


So if no court system is found acceptable by both parties... then what happens?


Yes, exactly like that in fact. I never said governments were the end all be all. But it's a cost/benefit analysis and I think that governments do more good than harm.


I'm not acting emotionally. I've explained explicit situations where strict libertarian policies fail and you have only rebutted them with "People are naturally nice." You are emotional about the merits of libertarianism and it makes you so anti-government that you run circles around yourself trying to explain how it would work. I would LOVE to see you start a boat community - not only would that be fascinating to watch, but it would also rid our country of tea baggers and maybe the government could pass some progressive legislation for once.

I agree with this, but taking away power does not mean that supporters are "anti-government". For instance I could take a knife away from a child, but that doesn't mean I am anti-child. Many of us want the government to have less control in this respect, but maintain control in other respects (police, laws, infrastructure, business regulation, etc.).

Technically, everything living, including humans, are slaves to the universe. We need food to eat, water to drink, air to breathe, and the Sun to enable all that, just to live.
According to the logic﻿ in this video, we are essentially slaves to the Sun, which in turn makes us slaves to the Universe.
The only way to escape this slavery is to kill yourself.

The fact that you can't say how an anarchist society would handle these issues is a strong case for statism.


You support violent gangs? I thought people weren't supposed to be violent or use coercion in an anarchist society? What happened to the freedom to live how you want? What about the the freedom to have sex without using a condom? What about when people start using vigilantism to kill people based on skin color or religious belief?


Absolutely. That's why we have democratic republic. The representatives are supposed to filter out bad judgement by the constituents. Have you studied constitutional law?


[The federal government protects rights](


What do you mean? Each citizen has 1 vote. Perhaps you mean criminals not being able to vote. I think they should be allowed to.


There is accountability. It's called elections. Otherwise, we'd be living in 1984 or North Korea.


This assumes that all people have good intentions, something you said was not true. You've never heard of people breaking contracts or doing nasty things even though it's illegal? Where does this common law or basic law come from? I thought there was supposed to be no laws? Also where does animal cruelty fit into this? Should people be able to beat and abuse their animals?


Who would fund the orphanages?


No it wasn't and even if it was, it's survives on the backs of all those who use it. It's a community effort to reform a system... just like the government is. The fact that you cite incorrect figures without so much as linking to a supporting website or study shows that you haven't thought critically about these issues. You probably got convinced about anarchy from circumstantial scenarios pushed by other anarchists. I was an anarchist when I was 14 because it seemed cool. Then I grew up an realized why we need police and welfare. Where is the empirical evidence supporting healthy anarchies? I only see the oposite, e.g. Somalia.


Yes most people think they have views that are bettering for the world, but some aren't. You think suicide bombers are fighting the good fight? No, some people need to be restrained or captured by the State and kept way from society. They should still be able to vote though, if they are citizens.
You're argument for anarchy seems to be a house of cards. So many of your "rebuttals" are based on assuming that people have good intentions (which some don't) or that profit would motivate people to be nice to each other. I see no evidence for this in any of your cited "facts". Where is the data that supports such a society?  
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:47:07
The defendant would have to consent to be tried in that court, otherwise it would be forcing him to participate in that company's practice - that's totally against freedom. The defendant could simply stay at home and be safe because he has his own laws on his property. Remember, you said he was a completely sovereign entity. Also the crowd-sourced swat team would have no right to step foot onto his property, and therefore would have no jurisdiction to take him out.

Imagine if only rich people could vote. I'm sure things would be very fair then.

As an Environmental Scientist, this is false. How would airplanes quantify and prove the amount of air pollution? I know of no such device that attaches to a plane. Also, the plane would have to measure the aggregate pollution from the plant, not just an instantaneous amount. All of this data would need to be corroborated by multiple investigations in order to hold up in court. How many people do you know could fund such an investigation into ONE corporation. The problem is that we're all victims of pollution from thousands of corporations. So, together, we've formed a solution to address these *public* concerns... I present to you, the gov't.


What about someone refusing to go to court. Surely, you can't think that people should be forced to interact with a voluntary court system. That's against freedom, right?


Not in a majority rules, one vote for all democracy. People need proper education and voting should be mandatory. Why would an educated 51% of the population vote for the economic interests of the top 1%?


What in this magical society would stop a police state takeover? What would stop the police forces (along with the courts, perhaps) from creating a monopoly and seizing resources? There are no laws to prevent this? So why wouldn't the people with the most force begin to enforce a police state? Your abolishment of gov't only creates the opportunity for new oppressive governments to form. Government is merely the result of the natural tendencies for people to resolve conflicts collectively. There is government in some form in every society because of this.


Government should be for the people by the people. The government should make some things obligatory. Pollution for example, affects everyone. Why should you receive the benefits of less pollution from my cleanup efforts? We're in this world together and we have a collective responsibility to make sure society is running smoothly.
