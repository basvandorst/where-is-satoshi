Truly top-notch line drawing.

Two things here: 
First, my understanding is that the standard policy is "First In First Out" and that bitcoin is taxed as a commodity. Suppose I buy 1 bitcoin in 2016. I move it to my ledger and keep it there in cold storage. Suppose that then today I buy another bitcoin on coinbase and then trade it the next day for so many ETH. From what I understand that trade (btc to eth) is taxed as if it was the 2016 bitcoin as the first bitcoin in is the first bitcoin out. I then owe capital gains tax on the 10,000 or so dollars that my investment has increased. Even though I never took that bitcoin out of cold storage. (someone please correct me if I am wrong, but this is what I understand to be the case.)
Second thing, I think that if you get audited, you have to be able to show when you purchased the bitcoin and at what price, otherwise they will assume the worst case scenario: That you got it in 2009 for a fraction of a penny and you will have to pay capital gains on the full value of the bitcoin, instead of only having to pay on the gains the bitcoin made after you bought it. 
Again if there is a tax lawyer here or someone who knows more, please chime in.

Is it btc dominance?
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:10:45
For the US, that’s correct. Note it’s only capital gains if you have had that bitcoin for a year or more. If you haven’t had it for a year, that 2 dollars is taxed as income.

I just sent an email to coinbase. I would encourage anyone with an account there to do the same. 
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:12:03
Yeah but the dip is not in usd value, it’s in btc dominance. That’s why the y axis is out of a hundred and the x axis is 2016-2019.

I think bitcoin is important because it provides the option to take control of your money. With bitcoin you can participate in the global economy without a bank account. 
But it’s also important to realize that there is a certain demographic that is not prepared for that. My grandma simply cannot tell the difference between real and satirical news, and regularly has her Facebook hacked. That women and the millions of people like her are not ready to be their own banks. They need a simple and straightforward way to use bitcoin or they won’t be able to use it. Coinbase is for them, and that’s okay. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:25:40
That’s rough. I don’t think there is anything you can do other than look at it as a life lesson and move on. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:12:49
Isn’t that the problem though? Huge price fluctuations will go away with mass adoption but so long as there are huge price fluctuations there is no reason why the masses should adopt it. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:14:50
You got a source on that? I’m pretty sure usd alone is in the neighborhood of 5 trillion. Are you counting only physical cash? Gold alone is around 7-8 trillion.

So philosophers typically distinguish between instrumental value vs intrinsic value.  Things have instrumental value insofar as they can get you something that has intrinsic value. Things have intrinsic value if it’s valuable for its own sake.
For example: money has instrumental value because it can get you other things: like a nice cold Coca-Cola. That can of Coca-Cola also has merely instrumental value. It’s valuable because when you drink it, you get pleasure. pleasure has intrinsic value (most people say). You want pleasure because it’s pleasurable; that is, you want pleasure for its own sake, not for something else it gets you. 
Understood this way, gold, silver, usd, bitcoin, any other currency, stock, or real estate, all have merely instrumental value. 
What has intrinsic value is a hotly debated topic. Some people say there is only one thing that has intrinsic value and that is happiness. These people are called hedonists. Others, who are pluralists about value have a longer list: happiness, autonomy, virtue, knowledge. But pluralists disagree about what should or should not be included in that list. 
Hope that helps.

There is an important difference between the sense in which bitcoin could theoretically be further subdivided into units smaller than a sat, and the federal reserve printing more money. When the fed prints more money everyone’s money becomes less valuable. This is because if I have ten thousand dollars in the bank, and then the fed prints a hundred million more usd, none of that money shows up in my bank account. My balance remains unchanged. However if I have 100,000,000 sats in my btc wallet and then bitcoin is changed such that it can be further subdivided by a factor of ten for example. At that moment, I then have 1,000,000,000 of whatever the new smallest unit is. That change was distributed directly and proportionately to me. In essence, the value of my btc has not changed at all, I can now simply spend it in smaller units. A closer analogy would be if the government decided to create a unit smaller than a penny for the US dollar. Let’s call it a zenny. If the us did make that policy decision, the amount of USD in the world has not changed, they just created a new unit.

Link to the interview? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:45:27
He is a very responsible investor and bitcoin represents a very small percentage of his total portfolio. He knows it’s speculative, but he thinks the potential upside out ways the very real risk. Also, you’re kind of an ass. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:47:30
He is a very responsible investor and bitcoin represents a very small percentage of his total portfolio. I think the risk is small because he would likely sell long before the price went to 0. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:43:41
No we talk we just don’t talk about money every time we talk. He had mentioned how bitcoin hadn’t been doing well a few times when we were around 6500, but that’s where he originally bought it, it was when it fell below 4,000 I thought he would be upset.
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:51:33
Could be. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:41:48
He thinks the larger us economy is in a serious bubble and that people will turn to bitcoin as a hedge of the us market goes into a serious enough economic downturn. He knows it’s a risk but he thinks the price is low enough to justify the risk. He is a very responsible investor and bitcoin represents a very small percentage of his total portfolio.
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:39:16
Eh, he made his own decision. He knows it’s speculative, and it’s a very small percentage of his larger portfolio. I don’t think it’s irresponsible.
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:49:01
Because I can’t tell the future, and I assumed that he would be upset for his investment having lost money. Was that not clear? 
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:08:49
I was thinking the same thing. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:52:41
I get why it does seem like a fake story as you and others have suggested.
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:51:22
He is a very responsible investor and bitcoin represents a very small percentage of his total portfolio. If you are well diversified (mostly mutual funds, and rental properties) there is no reason you can’t make a speculative investment in something with huge potential upside. Just because there are lots of irresponsible ways to invest in bitcoin doesn’t mean there aren’t responsible ways as well. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:51:53
Could be.
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:54:13
He is a very responsible investor and bitcoin represents a very small percentage of his total portfolio. This is either the death of bitcoin or just another crash on the way to another bubble. He is obviously betting on the latter, but just because it’s risky doesn’t make it foolish.
@_date: 2018-11-28 06:35:22
Yes, but something’s intended use can and often is different from its real-world use. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:46:21
He definitely expressed regret for not selling when it was high and buying back in after the crash, but don’t we all? 
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:20:41
Oh I get it, he was just equivocating on the word “could”.

I know we are celebrating early, but honestly it just feels nice to celebrate something these days. 
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:05:13
I agree with basically everything you said. I just don’t see why a moderate (2x) increase in the block size, doesn’t maintain that balance?
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:54:34
That is just a shitty argument. If it is supposed to be a global currency or even a global store of value, you should be able to move relatively small sums, like 100 usd without paying an outrageously high percentage as a fee. So no, when fees get bad, it doesn’t work.
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:20:19
There is one potential solution: Increase the block size to reduce fees to give better longterm solutions (lightning) time to develop.
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:58:32
I think it is important to realize there is a middle ground between a cheap fee, and a fee that is so outrageously expensive that I shouldn’t even bother moving my bitcoin. And what’s more this fee is totally unnecessary, because we could double the block size without any substantial loss in decentralization, or security. I’m not saying we should go full stupid like Bach and only rely on increased block sizes to scale. But that we can’t find a middle ground is both childish and stupid.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:44:18
Advocate for a moderate increase in the block size while better long term solutions are in development.
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:13:06
Going to voice this perennially controversial opinion: we should increase the block size. Segwit and lightning are obviously better long term solutions, but in the meantime, bitcoin still has to work and when the fees get bad, it doesn’t work.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:02:37
I completely agree.
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:47:56
It would be interesting to know what the rate of growth is  for new reddit users is versus the rate of growth of the bitcoin sub. Are we adding subscribers faster than reddit is adding new users? If so, how much faster? 
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:51:54
Yeah, but it’s also not enough of a block size increase. Right now bitcoin transactions primarily consist of moving bitcoin on and off exchanges, and still in peak time it gets ridiculously backlogged and expensive. If they would just double the block size bitcoin would be considerably more useful, while longer term solutions have time to scale.
