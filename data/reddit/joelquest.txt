Not a bitcoin expert like many here, but it seems that Coinbase is the safest way to purchase.  I've bought hundreds of dollars of coin for around 10-20 dollars.

can someone ELI5 Trezor for me?

Same here.  I actually LIKE Chase.  I don't buy BTC all the time, but when I do its through coinbase and no one has said or done anything

I day trade.  Just as fast as I was patting myself on the back during the last burst in price, I was lamenting at how fast I lost it...and more.

Sooooo.... after ETH dropped from 20 to about 10 the other day.... that wasn't a good time for me to invest to see if it rebounds?   
I read this sub in the hopes of catching up with the rest of you guys in here.   I'm usually 2-3 steps behind.

Wife and I were just talking about Electric Forest.  We've never been, but we're big fans of Insomniac parties.  I know you had an awesome time because Griz kicks ass.  Saw him at Movement last year.  Also Bitcoin kicks ass.

They're all going to end up on various crypto subs asking basic questions that are clesrly stickied, or in the sidebar.

This isn't for EVERYONE... because it takes time to learn patterns and develop strategies... however, swing trading (selling high - buying back in lower) can make your snowball much bigger.

Looks nice! Is this sorted by volume?

New to this... so keeping my BTC in a Bitcoin Core wallet and keeping the program closed isn't safe?  Or can I leave the wallet open so it stays sync'd and put some other kind of protection in place?

awesome.  I'm novice/amateur at this... most of what I read on the subreddits for each coin is above my head when it comes to technical aspects.    I day trade mostly.  
But I HAVE learned that it doesn't matter if a coin goes up 400% in a day... if no one is buying it, you haven't made any money.   
But after spending a lot of time with your page and comparing to coinmarketcap and some exchanges, I think it does a pretty good job of organizing the coins I would care to invest in.   
It's now a icon on my phone's homepage.   Thanks!!

eye opener, and over whelmed.   
So if I had some BTC in a wallet, what else should I be doing besides keeping a complex security pass phrase that is required for all transactions?

Heard this shop mentioned a few times on NEO CASH RADIO, which was my favorite crypto podcast... sadly I don't think they are doing the show anymore.

I'd prefer she NOT know about Bitcoin.  Anything that cuts into her buddies on Wall St. pockets will end up in her crosshairs for sure.   
Smart banks and wall st firms are adopting blockchain.  But, as we know... there's a lot of dinosaurs too that will fight it every step of the way.

Thomas Jefferson said that the tree of liberty should often be watered with the blood of tyrants and patriots.   
That's all I can think of right now
