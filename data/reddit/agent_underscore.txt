You simply have to excert a ittle pressure to persuade him that it is in his rational self interest to pay you. As he has a legit website it will be relatively easy to find his actual location and pay him a visit. If he is not persuaded by a simple request something like torching his car (you know which it is as you have staked it out before) usually does the trick.  For a small business in a little caravan or portacabin we might torch the whole thing.

Sell 70% right now, the remaining 30% will be worth far more than you got now *if* it soars but if it does not you can feel smug with your RealMoney^TM. When did you ever make money that easy ? Don't loose the opportunity now by following advice from those who bought in relatively recently.
FYI I "bought in" via mining in 2009/10 so my real acquisition cost is $0.03 . I keep selling a small percentage every month. Still plenty left (in $ terms) of course, am doubling the amount sold per month for 2017. Even at this rate have 15 years worth left so if price keeps going up will still have more wealth next year than right now.

I think it all started as a bit of mathematical fun and geeky hobby (mining) mixed with youthful "fuck authority" and libertarian nonsense which the young are often infected with. It was only later when the exchanges surfaced and real $ were offered for virtual ledger entries that the gleam of unforseen wealth entered the equation. Once you start with the NEW MONEY FUCK BANKS WOO HOO attitude but then have the STRIKE GOLD opportunity it's a bit hypocritical to ditch the first one so you have to keep up both ideas despite the inherent contradiction.

If we are honest about it it's not really a "currency" yet, is it ? I know you can use it as such in certain very specific and relatively tiny areas but on a world scale (it's being compared with world currencies in the article) it's is trivial and relatively useless. For the vast majority of ordinary citizens the opportunity to use bitcoin *as a currency* is severely limited. Hardly any merchants take it, hardly any employers will pay you in it and you certainly cannot use it to pay your government taxes.
So speaking truthfully the article is abject nonsense on this level alone. Also it seems to be crowing about measuring the value of bitcoin in fiat (and gold). WTF is that about. Sure if you are just in this as a speculator to make money maybe that is relevant but you will only make the money on this "best currency" scenario if you buy low and sell high. And I emphasise the point sell. No  money is made by the speculators simply buying and holding.
Quite frankly it's nonsense to look at bitcoin like this and it diverts attention away from the real issues which are (or at least should be) improving the protocol to provide better security, greater ease of use and promoting bitcoin as a useful offering for merchants to use for goods and services. And by the latter I do not mean the ridiculous so called Dark Markets idea to facilitate illegal/immoral activity. You are not going to get bitcoin transformed into a useful world currency by promoting it for selling weed or financing back page prostitutes. That kind of thinking is just immature and childish.

Bubbles in any price charted item are only identifiable in hindsight. Whether bitcoin is in, coming out of, still progressing towards a bubble or, (less likely) reaching a new stable price is totally unknown until you fast forward a few weeks/months/years and then look back.
Whether you are buying pork bellies, oil, Bitcoin or a stock you should have decided what your reaction should be to rapid increases and decreases in the price BEFORE you buy. Making it up as you go along is a recipe for mega loss.

No, about 90% of the accessible/useable Bitcoins in existence are held by less than 100 entities. They have the influence and power, not you.
You can interrogate the blockchain to verify this, only trace coins which are active after being mined and deduct those that have no activity in the last 4 years. Then get a list based on amount held and link back to large sums where a stash of say, 10,000 BTC has been split into smaller holding in inactive addressess. We consistently find its about 90% and with an upper bound of c. 100 entities (individuals/companies). It is possible the number of entities could be much smaller.

Part of the problem is that the vast majority of "enthusiasts" for the coin are not actually that interested in its use as a cash substitute they just see it as a means to get rich. Either by hodling as the price goes up and then selling out to the next generation of bagholders and/or by exploiting the weaknesses in on/off ramps, exchanges,wallets and peoples greedy brains.
It's the mentality of these greedy lazy dreamers, the mentality of idiots who think bitcoin is anonymous enough to have drugs shipped to their front door and the fucking massive stupidity of Venture Capitalists who have poured literally millions into idiotic schemes, these have all ruined Satoshi's wonderful invention.
On the other hand I have made a shit load of RealMoney^TM by selling off my Bitcoins mined in 2009 and 2010 so I guess every cloud has a *gold* lining.  
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:19:46
What, no seat belt ?
@_date: 2017-01-07 08:34:45
Snap. !
We mined similarly in 2009/2010 but using computer processing equipment we were supplying &amp; installing for a UK government agency and needed to "stress test" them. Bitcoin mining was an ideal algo to run to get the CPUs running as hot and as fast as possible. Perhaps unlike you (*found* hard drive), we kept detailed records of the results, mainly because we wanted to be super critical of how the processors were coping to better than a 1% accuracy. So that in itself meant we never lost track of our Bitcoin blocks or their addresses/keys (Unlike our friend Craig Wright !!).
When it became apparent Bitcoins had real value we didn't get excited like most miners as we were running a multimillion pound turnover company and were very busy with other stuff, some of which meant a profit of a million pounds in a week. Bitcoin at a few dollars was nothing, the details got left in the files. 
It was only when Bitcoin exceeded $100 that I started to put a bit of time on them. Looking at the situation with the bitcoin exchanges I made a significant decision - no on exchange dealing until we know the who what and where of the exchange and the people behind it and there is some sort of regulation in place. All exchanges failed our "integrity" test, we saw a high percentage of exchanges fold, have bitcoins stolen, operate exit scams, etc over the coming years.
I have therefore only ever sold my Bitcoins face to face for cash. Not a single problem or difficulty and quite appropriate really considering my view that bitcoin is a "cash equivalent". Over 50% of initial mined coins now sold at prices between $150 and $1590 dollar equivalent.
We did try using them to buy a few things from time to time but found it pointless really compared to other existing fiat methods so now its all kept in cold storage until we have another buyer.
As an experiment I suspect bitcoin has some years to run but personally think it unlikely it will ever become more than a minority interest currency. Certainly if you wanted to design a potential world crypto currency I doubt you would start with bitcoins specific design parameters, many alt coins have taught us there are improvements which can be made.

It may well be a suitable time to buy for some people but you should be very clear what you are trying to achieve and how you will act if it e.g. goes to 50% of what you paid or e.g.2 goes to 1000% of what you paid. This is quite difficult to do for most people and they tend to make it up as they go along oscillating between panic/hodling.

There is very little difference between 750 and 900 but you need to ask yourself what you are trying to achive. If you sold out at 750 to make money then you are presumably interested in just making money. If that is the case you might be better off investing some money in a course in financial trading. If you are into bitcoin because you believe in it we wonder why you sold out anyway. There is a disconnect here in your thinking and asking in/out advice here is not going to solve it. Address the disconnect.
@_date: 2016-12-26 16:02:55
An unnecessary level of complexity which really achieves nothing. At this stage in the game (i.e. bitcoin is TINY as a world currency) we would be better adopting a totally fee free structure. The spam is actually useful as a test input to ramp up the working TPS. So work out your TPS ramp system, implement it,add on fee free for a few years at least and then off you go. No doubt other problems will then surface so go fix them. Bitcoin is so far removed from a useful working proposition as a world currency the idea of changing the fee structure like OP link is just going in entirely the wrong direction.  
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:34:34
Here in UK, Bitcoin is only a small fraction of my net wealth but as I have always had accountant and lawyer due to various businesses I own it is all "left to them" to get it right. I declare Bitcoin sold for fiat on my tax return and account for due CGT on the indexed "profit", so far offset by allowable losses elsewhere. This has been going on for over 3 years now and have not had a single query from HMRC to date. If I didn't have plenty of other cash assets I would keep some of the proceeds of BTC sales ring fenced to allow for possible future tax claim. 
A further complication in the Uk might be if you are regularly buying and selling BTC and/or day trading for example. I only sell BTC I have mined personally so this does not arise but I have been warned by my account to "Never buy BTC, only sell what you have" as it would open a huge "can of worms".
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:47:45
I can personally confirm knowledge of a number of private investors in the UK buying significant chunks since late November, probably not the sizes you refer to, but in excess of 4 figures total over more than a dozen individuals. This was unusual as typically over the last 2 years the activity would be 1 or 2 buyers per quarter in much smaller size.  
@_date: 2016-12-26 16:08:30
You can analyse the blockchain and determine:
Number of mined blocks with no outputs.
Number of mined blocks with outputs where those bitcoins are unspent in another block.
And so on.
It's a dynamic number but provides an upper bound to "lost coins".

The point is lost on you. 
With regard to examining things for possible scam signs you have to suspend your initial "Of course it isn't" and become detached and do the looking properly. The comment about Obama's Birth Certificate is exactly that. Far far too many simply rant about conspiracy theory, nut jobs, racism, etc. They don't do the looking. This is exactly the point with bitcoin and this sub (I have lurked here regularly for over 3 years).
Take the case of Neo&amp;Bee. It was raved about and applauded on here by hundreds of subscribers but the whole thing failed my scam testing in many many ways and there was zero surprise at the final outcome.

I think most of us who have been around bitcoin for a few years can see the little diamonds of truth sparkling in the turd the OP has just produced. Reminds me of the Monty Python sketch, "Yes,yes, but what have the Romans done for us." 
The point missed by the OP here is the FUTURE ! All great things have to start small. Bitcoin right now is far from small (see market cap) but where it is now is an infinitesimal grain of sand compared to where it *could* be in 5/10/20y from now.
I do think, however, that if we could give at least equal weight in our enthusiasm to both the value/invesment side AND the development/testing/improvement side we might move forward quicker. Too much effort in the former sphere and not enough in the latter.
OK, many of you have nothing to offer other than your dollars and some posting (shit or otherwise) but there are plenty among us who have some skill set which could be applied. Step up a notch guys.

One should always try not to lose money, whether Bitcoin or fiat, in any kind of "scheme". So far I have been "lucky" enough not to have seen any such loss but there have been a few close calls. always do proper and considered research into anything that is a scheme.
Most (perhaps almost all) so called cloud mining investments are indeed scams of one sort or another. I would want to see details of who exactly is running it, what exactly is the hardware, verifiable pictures of the set up, etc. And you have to look at that stuff really really closely , look how easy it was to fool millions of gullible Americans with a multilayered pdf file of a supposed copy of an original Birth Certificate from Hawaii .

 I entirely agree. Yes, it IS small compared to VISA. But it's market cap is large compared to the turnover of probably 25% of the businesses in my town, so in that sense it isn't. We will agree that "small" is relative and if you reread my post you will see i am not saying otherwise.
You refer to lost bitcoins and imply I guess that they should not be in the market cap as they are unusable. True, I agree, what % are you guesstimating ? Even if 50% (highly unlikely) it does not change my comments really.

I expect to see considerable resistance above $950 and a lot of selling just below $1000 for psychological reasons. If $1000 can be broken decisively for more than a day or 2 then we should be looking at a new trading range in the $1000-$2000 region. There are a lot of "IFs" but an optimistic scenario makes me think $1500 for end 2017  is not unrealistic. And anything over $1000 is no cause for tears.

That's a bit harsh. There are probably quite a lot of us here who use PayPal quite regularly and successfully and many supporters of Israels position too. Anyway this is a sub about Bitcoin, try to keep your personal politics out of it please.

Resistance will be 970-980, provided it stays above 800 it's OK, a break below 800 is dangerous. Above 1000 develops new trading range 1K-2K but expect wide fluctuations.

I have done my part already, it's time for a few others to take the reigns, sold 50 going on holiday. 
I expect you will let me off as I still have over 500 left from my 2009/10 mining anyway. Will I sell some more when I get back - who knows ?
As an "earlier adopter" it would surely be very selfish if I just hodled them all, much better to spread it about .   
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:09:33
How long shall I go on holiday for then ?

Fair enough, you have convinced me, shall I call them Libertarian Truth Enlighteners ?
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:15:26
Really ? 
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:46:50
Today is the day I sold 50 you may do better but I will be on holiday for a month, please hold my bag while I am gone.

A wise choice, I fear.

Pick 7 other cryptocoins. Each day of the week pretend that you think ALTcoinX, will go to the moon and have a conversation with yourself as to why this is likely.
At the end of the week you will have learned something about bitcoin and rather more about yourself.

Excellent, are you getting a good premium for face to face cash sales compared to, say, Bitfinex exchange. I often get 5-10% premium for "instant" BTC but recently have had much higher premiums as enthusiast want to get in quick while the price has been rising rapidly, several sales at over 20% premium in the last 4 weeks.
50 BTC a week is impressive, I'm doing about 10 a week recently but doubt it will continue like this.

A more measured rational approach would be better. Panic selling and self-deluded hodling are 2 sides of the same cryptocoin. Try to be adult and grown up about it, you have all seen the historical charts, you know it goes up and down wildly for no logical reason. Understand this - it can and will surprise you. Try to take advantage of the volatility , always stay within sensible bounds vis-a-vis your own personal financial circumstances and responsibilities and don't ask for the number of that suicide hotline yet again. We should learn from history not repeat the same old mistakes.

None of the exchanges would function without loads of selling, have you ever had a look at Bitfinex' running order book for example ? All significant bitcoin exchanges have very active 2-way trading.
@_date: 2016-12-27 09:43:38
There is no such thing as an accurate price. It depends on where you are buying/selling and who with. Much of my selling is local face to face trades and I have sold in the last month at dollar equivalent of $1200, $1140, $1130 and $1020 for the 4 highest trades and all the buyers were delighted. 
For ecommerce type transactions the accurate figure will be related to your third party facilitator and which exchange or exchanges they either use or take as source data.
For friend to friend type transactions try to choose a reasonable sized exchange in your own country and you will find most people think that fair.

Are these crazy enough for you $66,666, $6 and $0.06 ?
Or would you prefer: $10,000, $5,000 and SFYL ?
You see what is crazy to one guy is a realistic considered guesstimate to another. Let's be honest , no one really has any idea but lots of you hope for a much higher price than now/your last buy in price (delete as applicable). 
Anyway, it's Christmas, be as crazy as you like today but come the new year might we have a bit more reason and rational thinking. We don't want to look like a rabble of excited children *after* today do we now ?

What is "large" ? Surely this is highly relative - lets have numbers please.

If you look at a suitable test group, i.e. lottery winners, it appears there are a percentage who self destruct ([e.g]( but these are a minority. The same is likely to apply whatever the source of the wealth, even Bitcoin.

It's Xmas holiday time so I am taking a well earned break from looking at price charts . Today I am looking at bitcoin related pictures. I find it interesting that many of the original bitcoin enthusiasts went off to copy Satoshi's work and spawn an alt (aka shit usually) coin. Copycat coins.
Now we see that this copy cat mentality extends to art. Find a piece of famous art, fuck about with it a bit, insert a bitcoin symbol or similar, and post it somewhere bitcoiny.
Whatever happened to [original]( content ?

This gets you from Cold&amp;Dark to Engines spooled up. Who is going to hold your hand as you taxi to the end of the runway and do you actually know the correct settings for the FMC with a lunar destination ? 
If I were you I would leave the APU running continuously "just in case".

Up here in the real world we laugh at little jokes like this, a little bit of humor is fine any day however serious your intentions. And those of us at the top with the clever financial knowledge or coding abilities would never be swayed but such silly blatant sex appeal nonsense. Unfortunately, at the back of our minds, we all know someone (or 3) who would be, that quiet nerdy guy who has very few real friends but thinks he is clever cos he once hacked the school computer. You know who we mean, still in his moms basement, discovered bitcoin 2 or 3 years ago, tried mining but failed, tried trading but failed, hasn't tried dating yet. HE is the guy who is going to take this seriously. So I say to you PLEASE do not forget nerdy virgin, for it is HE who will be holding your bag for you when you cash out at $3,064.
TL:DR More post like this please, we need them.
