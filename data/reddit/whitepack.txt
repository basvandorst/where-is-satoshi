I am very happy to read this! Thank you for helping out.

50%/50% but i might integrate a % share. I have to think about it so this way, everybody would get a % of the bounty according to the % of work they worked on.
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:34:08
Good news and welcome!

I saw you deleted your post about md5. Here is the explanation: This is to assure me the winner don't steal the coins out of me. If the winner has the passphrase, he can simply vanish with the bounty, contact WarpWallet and ask for the other 10 BTC reward. By doing a md5 of the passphrase, this assure me the winner will contact me and tell me the md5 he got and from there i can prove he really solve the challenge.
@_date: 2014-11-17 12:20:44
I understand your point. I am taking the risk that bitcoin value will rise in the next decade. I might be wrong but I am confortable with the fact that i might lose it all.

Under Chrome and Firefox, it seem to run perfectly. Under IE it seem to be slow. What browser are you using ? This is the first version of the website and i will optimize it when i have more spare time.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:24:32
lol funny how you end your comment. I know chance are small and i don't plan to pay my rent with the bounty. ;) I think it's a fun challenge and why not give a try. Feel free to boost the network up 40% whenever you want! lol
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:56:29
You can try to complete this challenge with your idea if you have a better one. This is the way i decided to try and i don't force anybody to take part of it.
@_date: 2014-11-17 21:59:32
+300,000 coins ??? Wow... How to explain that ?
Edit: Balance is ~550 btc... My bad.
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:25:57
This is the possible characters: 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ which means there is a possibility of 218,340,105,584,896 combinations.

I don't have any "cool information or insight". All i saw was the price reach 400$. I have not analyse it, i did not call Mr. Buffet to get his opinion about BTC price, i have not contacted NBC news and i have not been in touch with a Wallstreet trader to get some insight or cool information to determine if the price would stay above 400$... i have no clue. All i did, is create a simple "reddit thread" to let people know that BTC reached 400$ and i was happy because i bought it lower than that. PERIOD. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:44:10
Thank you!! 
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:26:49
Happy to read this! I will think about a way to assure the winner get his part of the work. If you have an idea, let me know. Thank you for helping out!
@_date: 2014-11-20 01:25:28
You don't have to enter a passphrase. Simply click the 'decrypt' button.
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:13:36
I don't know what you mean by "submit partial matches"... I have the proof in the database that a user tried and how many time he tried. I am not sure to understand what you mean.
I might be wasting my time but I am wasting it trying something fun and i enjoy working on this challenge on spare time. Lottery ticket is boring.
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:39:31
The link is at the bottom of my post. Here is a direct link:   (Under "Challenge" section)
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:09:13
Thank you for the tip! Very friendly. Concerning the challenge, i know it might be close to be impossible but i have fun trying to complete the challenge and i learn new stuff trying to complete it. I don't pretend to be wise enough to complete it. I simply put my idea in action and at the end... Even if it don't succeed i won't regret the time I put in this challenge. (Sorry for my bad english lol i feel awkward when i read it lol)
@_date: 2014-11-17 04:57:33
Yes I did. What's the point ?
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:51:44
I don't care. I will make another thread in less than 72 hours when BTC is over 400$ again... Bastard.
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:35:38
All the information about the challenge can be found here:  under the "Challenge" section.
Edit: I have not created the challenge, I am trying to complete it. :)
@_date: 2014-11-17 22:34:09
Thank you for the video. Now i can confirm it is safe! Wow, those numbers are impressive!!!
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:49:39
Are you Sherlock Holmes. How did you found out english is not my native language ?
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:06:21
You mad ? I was just happy to see it crossed the 400$ mark... 
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:59:41
Let's compare an apple with an apple. Reply to me in 'french' and let's see how good you are.... English is not my native language and yes i make mistakes. To be honest, i don't have a clue about what 'predicate' means and I am too lazy to open Google translator. If you can give me the definition in french... i will be happy.
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:42:28
Let me dream! 
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:42:31
Added a message in my post "Please don't send me any tips. Thank you". 
@_date: 2014-11-20 20:24:03
At least you have something! lol
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:02:19
I still hold and I am not in a hurry to make profit. I think I will hold for a decade whatever happen to the price 
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:14:58
I already tried with less characters passphrase and it was working fine. I am actually attacking the challenge properly i have no doubt about it.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:01:37
Nice find. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:47:26
You can say whatever you want to say but don't call me a lyer. I am not an encryption expert (just like the majority of the people) and honestly if someone give me a md5 key, i won't be able to create a 8 characters passphrase from it myself but i will be able to confirm if the md5 match with the passphrase. It might not be the best way, but it's actually the way i use. If you have a better suggestion, i will be happy to read and use it if I am able to.   
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:33:40
If you find the key, you will have a message with a unique "code" telling you to contact us. If someone else find the key before you, the website will automatically stop to decrypt and will show a message "Someone found the key!". Of course if it happen, i will give all the details here in this thread.
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:59:24
I bought lower than 400$ and i was happy to see it reach 400$... is it a problem to post about it here ? What's wrong with it ?
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:04:12
Tell me a good way to ensure the "winning person" gets their share of the prize and i will do it. Right now, you ask me the question and my first answer was "honesty" which don't seem to exist in the crypto world which is why if you have a good way i will be happy to do it. Another solution would be to advise the challenge owner (WarpWallet) that way, the second 10 BTC reward can be sent directly to the winner.
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:53:34
I guess people are happy to see price over 400$. My goal was not to give advice or super technical information. I was just happy the price went up and i made this thread. Next time, i will contact you first to get an official authorization before creating a new thread... Hmmmmm NO!
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:48:40
Lol, someone said i created this thread to get tips so i added this message asking people to don't send me tips minutes ago and now you still think I am asking tips asking them not to send tips. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:57:37
Same for me.
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:58:42
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:48:23
Thank you for taking part of this challenge! I would be nice to succeed!
@_date: 2014-12-29 01:28:27
You are not alone!
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:59:33
Stay calm and check back in 72 hours little bastard.
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:04:56
The website was up and down for several hours. If they are in the block chain give some time to LB to re-sync. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:59:12
This is a very good idea. Right now, the way it work is you get a special "code/key" when you successfully decrypt the passphrase which allow me to confirm you did it. It will for sure bring in more people if they are paid with "shares" they worked on. I am already calculating the "%" share of work so it would be easy to add a field for a wallet public key.
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:36:04
The javascript code is testing a single wallet (the warpwallet). The way my code work is it take the passphrase, create a brainwallet and compare it with the warpwallet wallet. If there is a match, the system stop, if not, it continue to test other passphrase.
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:11:54
Is it an obligation here on reddit bitcoin to have some cool information or insight to make a thread about the price ?
@_date: 2014-11-17 03:49:08
Thank you for the advice. I will hold for 10 years and i don't care of losing money over it. I am taking the bet that BTC will be worth a lot more than 400$ at that time. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 01:01:56
Good point.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:48:26
Good point.
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:27:08
People never thought it would drop below 600$ when they bought 'cheap' bitcoins at 610$. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. It's a technology and is actually crowded with people trying to get rich quick (speculator). Once they are out of the game we will finally see where it will go...without being manipulated.
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:20:53
I like the design. Can you add a link to a PSD version of it ? Great work.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:49:50
I never had problems but it would be a good decision to have a dedicated account for your BTC transaction. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:33:11
Don't spam this sub with useless post like this one.
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:52:50
121$ is more accurate.

@_date: 2015-01-03 17:42:36
BTC is not a get rich quick lottery. It's a technology. You don't buy BTC to get rich IMO. You buy it to use it. Edit: If you can't afford to see it crash... don't hold.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:18:02
lol I was sarcastic.
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:53:35
Just like WallStreet...
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:03:48
When people realize there is no reason for such low price, it will bounce back to $1200 and rest is history... (Lambo, Cigars, Mansion...)
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:38:59
This is good for holders. This is not for people who want to buy stuff with bitcoins as you can't spend a part of it. From what I've red you must create a new cold wallet each time you spend from a cold wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:21:05
Nothing wrong with it if you are ready to lose it all and/or hold for years.
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:38:51
Thanks a lot! I will try to figure out tomorrow how to tip on reddit. lol
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:22:34
There is fraud with fiat too... You are still happy to have fiat in your pockets.
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:49:49
Individually I understand it's almost impossible for now... Long time ago MD5 was impossible to crack and now we can crack it in seconds. What will happen to Bitcoin if super fast computer can crack SHA256 in a decade ?
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:19:57
Yesterday it was 24 hours and today it's 48 hours... There is a lot of red flags... Don't get 'stamped' just like you got 'goxxed'.
@_date: 2015-01-04 20:13:57
That made me laugh! 
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:24:51
Ok. I confirm Bitcoin can go under 0$ as it did peaked at -1.78$ years ago.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:59:02
lol greatest post of the day. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:52:47
Or.. If you don't have any bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:09:18
Thanks for clearing things up. lol
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:18:14
After analyzing the market with all my WallStreet tools I came to the same conclusion. Price is going down on all my indicators.
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:50:50
I have a small tube setup (6,400ghs) and my electricity cost is 0,10c/kW. With a Bitcoin price of 300$ I was making a profit less than 10$ per day.... Edit: I confirm the break even is NOT at 150$ 
@_date: 2015-01-07 00:03:45
Can't blame them. They have more important stuff to do right now...

Seems legit... Seriously, please don't fall for this...

You must add 'server=1' in your bitcoin.conf to allow RPC
Edit: sorry I saw in your post you already did this.

Cash deposit. Never use interac e-transfer unless you trade with someone you know personally.
Edit: Also ask for the deposit slip with the bank stamp.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:25:47
I agree with you.

China banning Bitcoin is now a monthly news! ;) $210 is your guess ? I think we will dip below 200$.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:10:34
Buying 2 in 1 transaction is crazy! Best strategy is to buy 0.5 then watch how the market react. Then you can repeat this process 3 more times.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:39:47
Western Union is OK too but only release BTC when you have the money in your hands.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:17:33
Hard to understand. To make money you must buy low and sell high. What's the point of buying at 400$ when you know it's going to 250$?
