Short answer HODL
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:15:06
Simple answer Of course you can . 
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:32:11
It was actually 30 lives lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:38:57
In a couple of months when it cracks 20k fomo will be back . This has happened so many times already 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:10:16
Is the dream still alive lol
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:15:55
I thought the 26th was 11500
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:18:46
This is nothing new with bitcoin . Big runs big pullbacks . Then all the FUD and told you so don’t blah blah blah . As soon as it shakes out then goes back to 20k FOMO comes back . Rinse and repeat . Come back to this post in the summer 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:26:06
Now show us the graph of the next 2-3 months 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:30:26
Remind me in the summer . Bitcoins has been doing this same pattern over and over . 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:56:35
Exactly this is nothing new to people who been into bitcoin more then the last 9 months
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:14:21
Very very hard to predict to far out but what I do see is a failure of the 6k support down to possible   4-5k then a nice bounce. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:51:20
Algos manipulation. Trying to shake longs n shorts out there positions
@_date: 2018-05-01 23:35:53
If anything sell sell sell . The last person we need the face of bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:56:58
Late fall will be a run up like last year 
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:15:16
Set stop losses . It drops below 6000s it’s going to get ugly 
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:33:38
Lol I think like this also . But unfortunately I agree
@_date: 2018-05-29 00:11:03
Yea and where right back eventually support is going to fail if we keep testing it . Good luck 
@_date: 2018-06-19 12:23:33
You can get bitcoin from there but it has bcash as the recommended purchase.
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:32:08
Dammm that’s like 20k Ads you watched to get there
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:11:08
Definitely not a scam . Just not as quickly adopted as most of last years investors thought . If you know bitcoins history it has taken over 80% hits repeatedly and bounced back every time . Only time will tell 
@_date: 2018-11-24 13:35:43
Looked up this Twitter account. Completely false . 
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:54:15
Hit that 9k resistance. Unfortunately bears in control 
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:21:45
Come back in 3 days let’s see if it’s still 7k
@_date: 2018-07-09 23:04:39
Way to many variables. You need to list specific components 
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:38:24
When you dumping now brah ? Lol
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:07:51
It will be lost forever unless someone can access the wallet it’s in 
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:58:00
Until we break the overall trend line where still In a bear market . A couple of Green Day’s doesn’t change that . Where getting close 
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:15:25
Interesting shows us break the downward trend that’s been up since 19k then ride it as support /consolidation before breaking out 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:50:04
Should have said 4 days lol
