You do realize that the problems plaguing Bitcoin scalability are fundamental to all coins right? Its a fundamental problem with blockchain technologies. Coins that perform better than Bitcoin right now only do because they are smaller. Bitcoin cash is not a solution. Scaling 2X is not a solution when we need a solution that scales 1000X at minimum.

Yes and not a single one solves the block chain scaling problem. Scaling 10 times as much as Bitcoin using tweaks to the protocol is NOT a solution.
Furthermore, Bitcoin can adopt any tech advance that any other coin comes up with. So calling it "not the future" is disingenuous. There's a reason Bitcoin hasn't already adopted these alt coin scaling tweaks. It's because they apply a bandaid to a missing limb.

Everything pisses off libertarians. Even other libertarians. They're like Baptists.

No. No no no no.
If you want to capitalize your business privately then keep your business private. The entire point of going public is agreeing to abide by certain rules, namely that information is shared equally among your investors, in exchange for access to significantly more capital.

"pretty comfortably"??? You can live without working off $200k a year taxed at the capital gains rate if you have $5MM in assets. That's better than most congressmen...
