Not really. A superpowerful eternal "god" is a much more complicated explanation than high energy physics, gravitation, biochemistry and evolution. It's just a much shorter word, but explains nothing.

Well, assuming that large quantum computers which can run Shor's algorithm become available, it will eventually be feasible to find the private key, but current computing really won't be able to tackle it efficiently for quite some time.
There are of course signature schemes that are not susceptible to being solved efficiently by quantum computers, but that's a bridge cryptocurrencies will have to cross when we get there -- right now, implementing them would make the blockchains even more unwildly without any real benefit.

Because he has never organized anything similar?
Not judging you, CTT, most people underestimate -- massively -- how much work something like this is. Sure, generating 5,000 wallets and filling them with $100 worth of bitcoin is trivial, but the idea isn't just to give MIT students $100 in BTC and then be done with it. That'd be almost a complete waste. The idea is to create more than a modicum of engagement and use by those students (say more than 30%). This is **hard**.
The whole project, while awesome, is a complete nightmare in terms of proper organization. If you want it to be more than just borderline effective, it is basically full time work for at least five to ten staffers -- and I'm being *extremely* generous.

Yeah, but you know what isn't? 
The world. What do you do in cases of famine, earthquakes and tsunami which destroy productivity and fundamentally change the economic situation of the populace of entire regions?
The reason why we have monetary policy with all its faults is that you have to be able to adjust to circumstances.

I know I'm probably going to make myself unpopular saying this, but my gut feeling in reaction to "Bitcoin's People Problem" would have been "people who write precisely this kind of article."


No. They're not. There isn't a substantial unradicalized undercurrent of revolution-seeking individualists out there. Libertarianism is a fringe philosophy, classical liberalism is too big to be fringe, but far away from a substantial position almost anywhere in the developed world except maybe the United States, where it's entwined with various other political positions in a stagnant two party system. People in the US aren't exactly *happy* about a lot of things, but they are far, far away from taking to the streets over it. 
You have singular movements, sometimes with a not unsubstantial follower count (such as Occupy Wall Street) and the populace will report a certain sympathy for them, the populace will also report that they aren't ecstatic about the world they live in, but they aren't as unhappy as this article and the associated general rhetoric makes them out to be. They're okay, and this isn't because all of these people are sheep, it's because life in this developed world, even if there are certain things that we might not *like*, generally **is** pretty okay. Most people have better things to do than invest their personal lifetime into a cause as abstract as a new monetary system when the existing monetary system generally works "okay". People don't care about the NSA, Facebook or AMEX "spying" on them because they live relatively boring and blameless lives and as long as their "secrets" rot in the data stores of companies and they're not being extorted, they don't necessarily see a problem. People don't care that their freemail provider, whats app or facebook can see the private messages they exchange with their affair, they care about their wife *not* seeing them.
It is what the data has been telling us for decades (and, basically, whenever this or something related was studied). There is a very slight change in this for the very young, but I highly doubt that this will be a "revolutionary" generation, either, instead of just an incremental step in which societal boundaries are being renegotiated. 
**TL;DR:** I think cryptocurrencies have a lot of interesting features that make them a useful tool, but the biggest threat to **Bitcoin** is the conviction held by many of its adherents, that you could or should push a political philosophy as well as a tool. People don't care about the philosophy of a new shovel, they care about it digging better holes than their previous shovel.

Yes, they do. You're treating "Greece" as something that is separate from its populace. It's not. It's a democracy. They can elect different leaders. Greece had to wipe out the life savings of its citizens because these same citizens had been living far above what their life's savings justified for decades. Corruption made a few people in Greece very rich, sure, and the rich profited the most and now suffer the least because they moved their money out of Greece, but that doesn't mean that the entire society did not accomodate this development for the last forty years. 
Yeah, the situation sucks, but not being able to force a devaluation in these circumstances means that it is getting worse with no real path towards improvement visible.

Uh, every major currency union in the past two thousand years?
The Eurozone *right now*?
A unified currency across multiple countries with their own fiscal and general policies cannot account for differences between different regions and while you can move from the city to the suburbs/outskirts when your city life becomes to expensive, intercountry and interlanguage mobility is much lower, if the other countries want you at all. 
You end up putting economically weak countries at the mercy of economically powerful countries because the weak countries cannot adjust their monetary policies to accomodate their productivity.

Except this is precisely what has happened quite a few times in the past and attempts at fixing it tended to muck it up more for a good while afterwards.


I guess it would depend on how you define "crippling", but Hong Kong *in* the 90s and Japan *since* the 90s certainly qualify as both growing economies and as being hit with substantial and problematic deflation. Furthermore, you're looking at deflation from a very restricted perspective. As points out, a very major issue is wages, which will fall as well -- and if that's not possible, people will lose their jobs and they suddenly face the problem that they won't be able to afford things because they don't have acess to capital. This is exacerbated because the value of debt rises and squeezes poor people further. A deflationary currency and a complete lack of monetary flexibility is a fundamentally bad idea. Bitcoin has a number of great ideas, but this isn't one of them.

The Dogecoin Foundation followed suit and when they demanded something more formal, we obliged. 
One of our members had previously filed complaints with the SEC, FinCEN and the FCC over the last several months.
Also, full marks for pretentious company names there, Coin-Swap.net.

I came here to post this. 
Just. Wow.
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:20:34


Let me summarize this: You Fail Economics Forever.
There is a reason why the world went off the gold and silver standard. That reason is economic flexibility. Currencies need to be able to adopt to regional variations in spending power and availability, if they do not, you end up in a completely unstable economy.

It is a little bit more complicated: being, in the end, infinitely deflationary is a shortcoming of bitcoin, being minimally inflationary is a similar flaw in dogecoin. Neither model is sensible for a working currency.
As for it being worth less and branding, more generally: psychology is incredibly important. The fact that a lot of cryptocurrency people don't realize this is one of the reasons the press tends to be so focused on bad things instead of good things.
Value: Sending fractions is counter to our everyday experiences whereas we can easily parse slightly "high" numbers and make sense of them being worth a certain amount. That's why the whole "tipping in bits" thing became popular after Dogecoin demonstrated this quite clearly.
Sure, you can say this is ignorance or stupidity, but good luck getting market adoption with that attitude.

Care to cite sources?




Uh, multiple fairly well respected security researchers, computer science PhDs from top universities and quite a few others, of the top of my head; sure, you also have a lot of people who are less technical, but your assertion is pretty uninformed and short-sighted... lots of people, myself included, enjoy working on projects with some "fun" and "engaging" aspect instead of finding joy in being purists.

I'm aware of both, but you're conflating initial design decisions with subsequent development. 
There were a number of unwise design choices and flaws inherent in how dogecoin was started and these necessitated substantial changes to the codebase. Most everything that was done after Dogecoin turned from a joke into an actual payment protocol and became somewhat widely used was done in an almost textbook fashion. There were squabbles, but these exist in every open source project. 
As such, I don't see "one blunder after another", I see initial issues which were fixed and a payment protocol which served as a quite interesting testing bed for a number of challenges that Bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies based on its model might face in the future and which were implemented without significant issues in almost all cases, including hard-forks. 


I've rather walked into this... naming people without their knowledge is a bit of an issue unless they themselves previously declared this and even then, unless they come here and verify it, it's still an issue. 
As such, those I can think of, off the top of my head and who have made it abundantly clear: Don A. Bailey and the other people who worked on the audit [Forbes reported on]( Atif Nazir and the other SoChain/Block.io people; the two Stanford CS graduates who started [backslash.io]( which was initially exclusively dogecoin; the author of doughwallet (admittedly, merely a port). I'll ask a couple more people to come forward, though.
