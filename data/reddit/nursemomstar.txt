Quoting from your article 
“Coinbase and other exchanges sometimes report currency withdrawals as sales, but they really aren’t.”
What do you mean they are not sales? Isn’t withdrawing currency meaning BTC to USD a sale right away?

Can you give me more examples for the United States.
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:20:26
Yes, account manager trades for me. I do have the list of ALL trades done so I will put all of that in form 8949. This is the correct way to do this right? 
My only concern is, the way that broker account works is the profit is also withdrawn BACK to bitcoin wallet therefore I have to convert them to cash anyway to use. 
So, if I’m already accounting for all the trades on forex account and getting taxed for short term capital gain, why do I also need to report bitcoin transactions if they are essentially from the same money.

Do you know if LBC exchange reports profits to the government when we are cashing out?
@_date: 2019-11-22 04:22:50
What wallet is best?
@_date: 2019-11-26 16:34:24
Can you explain what “mining contracts” are. Like what are the red flags for scams.
@_date: 2019-11-19 12:18:42
Can you explain more about open ledger? So how to get money myself if not linked to bank account?
@_date: 2019-11-26 21:52:12
Got it! And that is what we put on form 8949 yeah?
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:00:26
How do I pay directly with BTC? Just go through one of the websites you listed?
@_date: 2019-11-19 04:58:02
Do you know how taxes work when cashing out to bank account? I guess I am trying to avoid that because it will just get taxed and IRS has to know about the profits right?
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:38:47
Ok I got it. What is BTC is sent to my wallet from the broker account. No need to report that unless I use it. Right?? Please tell me I got that right. Haha.
@_date: 2019-11-26 16:39:45
Thanks for this. I was just wondering reading about bitcoin. Was just maybe thinking of gaining profit from BTC one way or another but in a safe legit way. This isn’t safe or legit. Lol
@_date: 2019-11-19 21:18:31
I’m in the US. Will the IRS ultimately see that I am paying bills with BTC?
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:06:05
Gotcha! Thank you.
What if I am gifted 1 BTC. So no evidence of buying bitcoin but will use it for either cash or other services, still considered capital gain? From 0 basically?
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:40:14
Yes I believe you. I mean to pay taxes I just don’t know how to report capital gains
@_date: 2019-11-19 12:22:51
Got it. I don’t know HOW to include profits in my taxes. Like put it under other income?
I basically buy BTC, trade it using forex, withdraw my profits (after paying tax) back to bitcoin wallet. Then I want to use those to pay bills or transfer back to my bank. Is this a reasonable way?
@_date: 2019-11-27 06:08:35
What is considered significant? Then you just pay more taxes when April comes around right
@_date: 2019-11-18 20:48:10
New to BTC wallet so not sure if people will buy from me right away. Is Selling the only way to get coins to bank?
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:02:18
One more thing, I transferred BTC to broker account used those BTC to trade Forex and I did make pretty good capital gain. I will withdraw all back to BTC wallet and use those to pay bills and such. 
I am already going to report capital gain on form 8949 from Forex transactions and since I am reporting that aren’t I free to use any of my gains without having to report BTC transactions? Not sure if I make sense. Like double reporting?
@_date: 2019-11-19 21:20:02
And also, how do I make use of BTC in the real world without selling??? For example I want to spend money on so and so
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:41:32
How about sending BTC to someone’s wallet. Not selling/buying, just giving.
@_date: 2019-11-20 00:14:19
Because if things aren’t reported properly they can come back and charge fines
@_date: 2019-11-26 16:42:51
 
Guy says it’s cloud mining (to make things more complicated) but he guarantees pay out even if you start with $100. I already know it’s a scam but I just want to know why they say people profit from these.
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:07:25
Are you trolling? Can you explain. How much capital gain did you have for that year and paying quarterly tax how come? Sorry need some more insight.
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:13:06
Wow great explanation.
Thanks for this. I will buy some BTC now that it’s a little lower haha. Then how do you make money off it? Just hold on to it and sell when price increases? 
What do you know about localbitcoin.com to buy BTC and find a safer wallet to keep the BTC? I’m only going to buy little at a time.
@_date: 2019-11-27 00:02:54
Gotcha. You could just pay it all once in April right? Quarterly is just an option?
@_date: 2019-11-19 04:49:23
What is the best way to withdraw money to my bank account. Safest possible way. And also, not reported to the government I want to avoid taxes
@_date: 2019-11-21 18:02:51
I think I have to report all the coins even if I don’t use it because I am transferring profits from Forex broker account to bitcoin wallet and from there I use 50% on bills and 15% I use again to trade forex for the week and back to wallet again at the end of the week with the profits. So technically all my coins are from profits minus the ones I bought initially to start trade. Am I getting that right?
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:48:52
Wow thank you for this. I understand better. Do you do your own taxes or have an accountant? Since I have only started bitcoin and forex trading a little while ago, I am very confused about it all but one thing for sure I know is I have to pay taxes. 
For example my very first transaction is this. 
Bought 500 USD from localbitcoin — sent that to forex broker —- bought more BTC to pay 10% tax before withdrawing profits — $$ profits deposited to bitcoin wallet. Use 50% on bills and save 50% in wallet. 
Do this all over again. 
What do I report when I do taxes?
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:35:34
So you don’t put all transactions on bitcoin.tax? Just the ones you think is appropriate? What if i put all transactions just to be on the safe side, will it know which ones not to tax me on?
@_date: 2019-11-19 03:26:10
So I am on LocalBitcoins.com. I just withdraw from there?
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:01:15
And why do you say cashing out is the most stupid move
@_date: 2019-12-07 17:52:17
Are you in United States and file taxes in US? Do you ever sell BTC for cash? How can you get away with it
@_date: 2019-12-07 17:17:12
I’m trying out a trading platform.
@_date: 2019-12-08 03:12:01
What if I didn’t purchase it, what if I invested it on a trading platform and it was traded for me and they just send profit back to my wallet. For example I spent $500 and received $2000 in BTC back to my wallet. The date I received it would be my record, right? But would all of that be considered income even if I don’t sell all $2000? Sorry for all the questions.
@_date: 2019-12-07 20:22:08
I don’t believe people who make thousands of dollars in selling BTC actually get away with it? Maybe I’m just ignorant about all this. Lol
@_date: 2019-12-07 18:15:11
And then don’t you transfer it to your bank? So it’s the same thing or is it not? Sorry I’m honestly not sure.
@_date: 2019-12-07 17:52:50
But how am I gonna pay taxes on BTC that I never sell? I thought we pay taxes on BTC we sell
@_date: 2019-12-07 17:16:49
I figured that. So just include that in the tax form? For every $1000 I cash out?
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:03:54
Sorry for unrelated question, how does bitcoin ATM work in terms of conveying BTC to money. How is that different from going through localbitcoins.com and sell.
@_date: 2019-12-08 11:42:36
I’ve only used localbitcoin but looking for another exchange. Is kraken or Gemini good exchange? 
Anyway it won’t be every month that I will receive BTC in that amount so I probably will not be cashing out over 50K a year
Thank you so much for all the information
@_date: 2019-12-07 18:34:52
So how do you make use of your money? By the way how much do you keep in there
@_date: 2019-12-07 19:03:35
I do want to pay my taxes properly. Just don’t know how to do so.
@_date: 2019-12-08 15:12:58
If I were to just do quick sell on Paxful without creating adds, do I need to still do KYC? Unfortunately my bank does not allow cash deposits so I would have to do something like Zelle.
@_date: 2019-12-08 11:39:59
Thank you. I have a better understanding now. It will basically be added as other income since I also have an employer who pays me in $
@_date: 2019-12-07 20:19:51
Did I say that? I’m simply asking how to properly report and pay taxes
@_date: 2019-12-08 01:03:59
This is if bitcoin is bought right? Not if it’s deposited to my account from trading platform profits.
@_date: 2019-12-07 21:18:49
You these so called “bitcoin millionaires” you really think they never turn any BTC into cash and they never pay tax? I find it hard to believe that people who constantly sell BTC and say they make about $20,000 a year selling BTC that they don’t include that in their income?
@_date: 2019-12-07 20:26:44
Oh ok lol
@_date: 2019-12-07 20:22:50
@_date: 2019-12-07 18:12:19
I’m guessing because it’s attached to your social security number? When you sell on exchanges. And cash flow in your bank account?
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:23:22
Ok right I was just wondering what the difference is by using bitcoin atm to cash vs selling bitcoin for cash. Pros and cons of both?
