I have this magic that I can always sold at the bottom and bought at the ATH.
And the movement I clicked buy price start to fall and if I clicked sell the price goes way up.
I feel so talented. I’ll inform you guys next time I prepare to buy or sell and you guys know what to do.

I literally clicked his ad every time it shows before video just to cost this annoying guy a bit. For now I could possibly spend him 200 dollars.
Fk this guy.

So predictable... Now the swing starts to go down, prepare your money for the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:00:53
Me too, mate. Seriously the candle chart is better than any other movies I've ever watched. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:59:57
Like how?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:17:22
It'll enter the acceleration dips part, buckle up mates!
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:15:43
Here we comes to the plateau part.
Don't rush in, there will be a new low.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:03:11
Warned you.

1. It dips, people sell, dips accelerate, people panic sell, hit new low.
2. Then it bounces, people buy, bounces accelerate, people panic buy, it grows back a little.
3. Then it hits plateau, then it back to  and all over again.
I watched this down journey the whole night, the swing happened 3 times and now is the fourth I believe, every time we have a new low.

Sold all at 11000 and then bought back at 15500, just sold again at 13800 and thinking buyback again. Am I doing this right?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:27:04
Now is the perfect time to be a pattern trader.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:53:39
Be ready for another dump guys, it's time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:13:02
It's like I played swing the whole night... Exhausted.

I have already done this. Sadly the whole community was down so didn't see much effect on diversifying, but Litecoin has more upwards potential consider it's "cheap" price per coin. I mean most of people buy litecoin because they can own 1 even coin.

Why not, 13592 at 9pm last night, bounced back to 14794.
Then 12805 at 2AM this morning, bounced back to 13988.
Then 10400 just now, and now is 12888. Do you see some paterns here? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:29:55
I got a feeling it won't hit a new low since we just almost touched 10000, but it'll definitely have some more swings through out the day.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:48:29
Every swing comes with up and down, now is the up, expect the down before it stabilized.

Based on my observation the correction time is become shorter but more frequent as Bitcoin becomes more and more volatile.

This is my observation for the whole night. It happened 3 times last night, I think now is the fourth. Stay put guys.
