The thing with bitpay though is it is actually a prepaid debit card. Once you sent your btc to the bitpay wallet for the debit card it locks in the cash price you sent. Say you send  $500 btc to the wallet and bitcoin crashes your card value will still be $500. Same thing if bitcoin price goes up. You still have $500. Good and bad depending how you look at it.

You probably need to send the Btc from binance to a wallet first. The atm probably doesn’t accept payments from exchanges. That’s my guess at least.

It’s way better than Venmo in my opinion because you have the option to instantly send funds to your bank account. Venmo take like a day or so. 
Also now if someone sends you cash you can just turn it in to btc just like that. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:54:48
That’s what I got from it
