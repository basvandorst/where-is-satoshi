Thanks for the clarification! How would one proceed protecting profits when day trading? I assume just converting back to the most safest crypto currency (BTC, ETH) would be the most efficient strategy to save costs on fees etc... If markets act kind of normal of course meaning that there are no severe corrections or crashes.

Taking profits is still not clear to me. Can someone please confirm or correct my train of thought? Scenario: When daytrading NEO/ETH on Binance and you decide to take profits. Does this mean that you just sell NEO's back to ETH? Or, does it mean to sell NEO to ETH then transfer ETH back to e.g. Coinbase and exchange it to FIAT? What if I take profits by selling NEO back to just ETH in a overall downtrend market? Wouldn't this mean that I loose the profits made by selling NEO because the markets are bearish. What about the fees and the time between selling NEO to actually have everything exchanged to FIAT?
When the markets are bullish, my guess is taking profits means not to sell crypto back to FIAT but just keep ETH, BTC etc..?
Not sure if I make sense here...
