Do you remember on your Mycelium, were there two or more "accounts"?
On the main balance screen, you tap an account and it shows the balance of that account.
HD Multibit afaik only supports one account per phrase.
That might be the cause.

@_date: 2016-08-19 04:50:40
Yes, that is one account with 0 BTC.
All of those tappable bars are accounts attached to the 12-24 word phrase.
Multibit HD is not my strong suit, so I can't really help there, but I can tell you Copay will work. You have to create a new wallet using advanced settings and pick the path m/44'/0'/0' for first account, m/44'/0'/1' for second account etc change the last 1' to 2' 3' 4' in order to recover all accounts.

12 word mnemonics have 128 bits of entropy, plus each guess requires thousands of iterations of pbkdf2 (which is slightly better than naked single sha256 brain wallets)
To be honest, 128 bits is still heat-death-of-the-universe hard to brute force if you used the old insecure brainwallets.
The reason "brainwallets" are insecure and "mnemonics" are recommended is because the former is generated by a human (bad at generating entropy) and the latter is generated by a computer (better than a human at generating entropy)
You can make up little tricks to make brainwallets more secure, but they will not be as secure as 128 bits without sacrificing the properties brainwallets were supposed to offer.
Mnemonics are an attempt at making machine generated entropy easier to store by writing it down.
It's easier to write down "brick job wax" than fe6d93d1.

Hint: If you are relying on obfuscation of the redeemscript to protect your bitcoins, you are going to have a bad time.
You need to assume that every piece of data besides the private key is known when you decide how to secure the private key(s)...
You can NOT set your security based around "oh, well I don't need to secure my private keys as long as I don't give away my redeemscript"
Therefore, it should not matter either way, and you are worrying about nothing.

Smart Contracts will always refer to a pie in the sky concept of "contracts smarter than currently available."

If you want to define Smart contracts as turing complete, then maybe... But I feel like the idea of smart contracts is about to suffer feature bloat to the detriment of security.

You need to realize that Copay is multiplatform.
For PC, HELL YES SET A SPENDING PASSWORD FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
For iPhone, the assumption is that you have a lock on your iPhone to begin with, but in case you are one of the dumb people who own bitcoin on their phone and don't set one... this app will allow you to set a wall of protection that is app specific.
If you have a spending password set. The Copay app can not ever touch your keys without you entering the password first. This means that anyone who opens the Copay app on your phone is the same.
If you have Touch ID set, then it could prevent the incident where you hand a friend your phone to look at a picture and he sees the bitcoin app, and taps out of curiosity.
So Touch ID to place a wall around your balance / privacy.
Spending password to place a wall around your keys. (the wall even exists between Copay and your keys, which is why it will need to ask you for the password every time you send)

Are you sure you used Electrum to generate that phrase?

No one said LN was free.
In your case of $1,000 for a normal closing fee, that would mean that using the CURRENT bitcoin method (fully on chain) is $1,000 per transaction regardless of amount. (Based on data size)
So think of it this way:
If I use my channel 200,000 times over the course of a year, each one of those transactions would cost me one cent each ($2,000 for the input transaction and redeeming transaction combined)
Heck, some people will probably use it millions of times a day (like businesses) which would mean that they are still TOTALLY happy with a $1,000 closing fee, as it works out to 0.0001 pennies per transaction or something.
The only solution around this is to completely decimate the market for fees. Which would only be possible by eliminating the fee concept entirely (hard fork) and somehow incentivize mining by a perpetual mining reward, or hope that running a lightning node and taking fees on that becomes more lucrative... But then people would move on chain in droves because on chain is zero fee and LN has small, but non-zero fees.

I think it boils down to this:
No one wants to carry their wallet with hundreds of dollars in it walking through the roughest part of the inner city where they live.
Why? Because someone will take it all.
In the same way, someone using bitcoin would like to avoid "the rough parts of the inner city" of the internet...
But unfortunately 99% of the population does not know what to look for, what's suspicious, and what to do once they've been attacked.
Some karate master might feel comfortable walking through the slums at night, just like you and I feel comfortable with out bitcoin wallets. But for everyone else, there are trusted third parties who protect your funds (banks for dollars, and Coinbase / BitGo etc. for bitcoins).
I think TEE becoming more prevalent on mobile devices, as well as rumors that apps downloaded from app stores can be somehow verified by the user against the signing keys of the developer, and simplifying that process for non-tech users will be a huge breakthrough for bitcoin ease and security...
But tbh, there will always be the guy who falls victim to social engineering, which would have drained his bank account just as well as his bitcoin account... but because it drained his bitcoin account he'll just assume it's bitcoins fault and eventually lose his bank account too :-P
@_date: 2016-04-04 04:40:32
1. No it is not. It is a standard known as BIP39 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal  which is used in MOST major wallets out there right now. (With some famous exceptions such as Bitcoin Core and Electrum. Electrum also uses a phrase, but it is NOT compatible with BIP39, and Bitcoin Core still uses individual keys stored in a file. Each new key increases your backup filesize by 32 bytes (ish)) If the app ceases development, you can recover your seed using one of a million tools that the community has made, but to be honest, if breadwallet goes under, the community WILL pick up and continue breadwallet's development, as it is an amazing piece of software, and no one in the community wants to see it die. The recovery phrase is a "seed" from which a tree of bitcoin private keys grows like branches infinitely. The app is set to generate the same branches in the same order, so as long as the seed is the same, the branches will always be the same.
2. The wallet is stored in the secure enclave on your device. No secret information EVER leaves your device, so if you don't write down your phrase and your phone explodes, you lost all bitcoins you had on it. You keep record of the bitcoins you have by asking the network to inform you of transactions that are pertinent to your wallet. breadwallet does not collect any data on this, your phone's breadwallet app connects to and ONLY to the bitcoin network directly in regards to your transaction and history data.
3. The question is wrong, wallet info is ONLY stored on your device. (see above) And you CAN have the same wallet on 2 phones... it's just not secure. Remember, security is not something you can "take back" once you've lost it. For example, you're playing around with bitcoin with carefree feelings right now, so you enter your phrase into 6 devices just to test that it works on all of them at once. You think it's cool. Then you forget about it, and 5 years later you start using the app again and still are using the same phrase. Unbeknownst to you, a hacker stole your phrase from one of the devices with malware (or that you sold at a pawn shop or something) and is just sitting there, waiting, watching. Then you decide to store $50k on your breadwallet and BAM, thief runs away with your money because of something you did years ago. breadwallet discourages this by telling you never to enter the phrase ANYWHERE, because the app should not assume how much security you need... it should always recommend the MOST SECURE things to the user just in case.
4. Yes, see above.
5. Verifications, or "confirmations" as they are more commonly known, are when the bitcoin blockchain actually contains your transaction. Until you receive your first confirmation, your transaction is stored on every bitcoin computer's memory, waiting for it to be included in the next block on the end of the blockchain. There are some rudimentary protections built into the software that states that "if I see a transaction that is trying to spend the same bitcoin as a transaction I've already seen to a different person, I will reject that transaction." however, there is no guarantee that every bitcoin computer will have those measures in place, as well as differing versions having differing propogation rules causes a small chance of fraud before 1 confirmation occurs. So maybe your transaction is only 50-99.9% safe with 0 confirmations, but once you get 1 confirmation, that jumps to like 99.96% safe. Then 2 confirmations is like 99.9992% then 3 confirmations is like 99.9999999999997% safe, etc. etc. So for example, if I'm a store and I accept credit cards, I don't know whether your card was someone's stolen card, or whether you'll chargeback and take your money back until about 3 months after you leave my door. Bitcoin is a huge improvement on this. However, if you hand me $50 cash, there's 100% chance that I'm safe. (well, except the chance that you'll punch me and take it back :-P) You only have to wait for confirmations if you aren't comfortable with an unknown rate of fraud. If you trust the person or if you can somehow verify that person is trustworthy, then you can do whatever you want. I personally wait for 1 confirm for anything over $50 worth, 2 confirms for $500 or more, and 3 confirms for anything in the $1000 or more range. If you are paying be for beer, I'm not gonna sit there and say "HEY, MATE! DON'T LEAVE TIL THE BLOCKCHAIN RECORDS OUR TRANSACTION, MATE!"

Requiring at least X on-chain transactions. This could potentially be other nodes who are willing to commit money to a channel that you are not committing any money to... but then they run the risk of opening a channel (which they paid the fees for) and having to bear the full cost of also closing said channel if the user never receives any bitcoin. (not to mention the LN node that connects to me would have to lock up funds with no guarantee that it will ever give benefit to them.
Difficult to justify on a fully peer 2 peer 100% evenly distributed network, which is why users will need at the very least enough bitcoin to "share the load" of the closing transactions's fees (remember, to close, you need to send out 2 transactions on-chain, the commit transaction with CSV and THEN the current balance transaction after the relative locktime.)
The only way I could reconcile such skewed incentives would be if 1. everyone on the network is altruistic and sacrifices their money for the greater good. or 2. if people like create 0 AML/KYC style free-signup hubs where you are guaranteed a nice fat channel with 0 money down on your end, and in exchange for that, his company (or DAC or whatever) gets more users, bitcoin gets easier on-ramping (remember, fees on-chain will need to get bigger in the future), and more users also means more fees for routing non-members' payments through their fat channels spanning across large parts of the LN.
(edit: you could even pre-generate the hashes of 100 secrets and sign each hash with your private key and give them to the hub to hand out while you're offline. Now the "must be online at all times" problem is solved.)
Perhaps my explanation is leading too many people to believe I am all for Coinbase and KYC/AML and not owning private keys. I'm not. I am a very active member in the bitcoin open source community for the past 3 years.
I'm just saying that LN without hubs is a nice feature as an add-on to existing bitcoin software. With hubs, bitcoin could be the hotmail of bitcoin.
It's also very possible that we could all be wrong and LN fails horribly. Who knows.

If I want to know how my PC speaks with my Trezor and ledger, I need to look at two sources to figure it out.
Since the idea of "a device which protects private keys that signs data with a second factor of authentication" is something that will likely be VERY prevalent in the future in the bitcoin space, it is unrealistic to expect every wallet to add a plugin for every single new device. This increases the amount of software side code used to interface these devices, and increases complexity of the exchange of data which would make it easier to mask a backdoor by one of the hardware wallet makers.
By standardizing it, a wallet like Electrum could maintain one single plugin which would support ANY hardware wallet that was compliant.
It's one of those things that someone should have proposed a while ago, but hardware wallet devs were too busy innovating, and everyone else was too busy innovating. Standards usually come after a "wild west" period... Which I think with all the HW wallets out now, has been long enough.
Great proposal.

I agree this is where we are heading, but every 5 cent payment would cost you 2-5 cents in bitcoin fees. (If you visit faucets, even more.)
Brave's micropayment vision begs for a payment channel system.
If your browser connected to the Lightning Network, and the other website was as well, you could easily send over sub-cents for little (like 10 satoshis) or no fees at all.
Heck, if brave wanted to run a large payment hub sitting on top of the lightning network and also connect directly to other sites, brave could write up an agreement where they don't take fees from their own users, but only on payments routed through their hub by external parties. That way all browser payments are free from the user perspective.
There are a million ways to do it. We'll have to see.

Hi there, are you new to the term "collectible"?
I saw a gamecube game at gamestop selling for $5. Looked on eBay and people were buying it for $100...
Best $95 I ever made.
This works out because odds are they couldn't find a store with the game used (assuming because it's rare?) and I just happened to be lucky enough to spot it.
But still. something worth like $5 and $40 when it was brand new is now selling for $100 because of supply and demand.
If you can go out and buy a 1BTC cassacius coin for 1 BTC... Why not sell it online for 2 BTC (which is lower than most prices nowadays) and now you have 2 BTC instead of 1?

So then how does a user receive funds on the LN when they first install the app?
They can't.
A bitcoin app supporting LN is merely an extra feature on a bitcoin app that very well may be automatically activated as soon as you receive bitcoin, but until then, you can't even receive money via LN.
LN's channel structure and HLTCs are great advances in technology, and will be useful for IoT machines with pre-loaded bitcoin, or self-mined bitcoin, or revenue re-utilizing features... But for the average layperson it needs to be free to sign up, useful immediately, and clean UX.
This is possible with LN, what if organizations like shapeshift.io spring up in jurisdictions around the world and say "hey, give you a free account. Two taps and you can instantly receive from Bob, who runs his own LN node or Jill who is a member of our competitor.
No trust involved, just a two-way incentive. They want you to join their hub, because it means they route more payments and gather more fees. You get instant access to receive payments.

The question is not about the algorithms themselves, but the ways you use them.
I sign code with pgp once verifying with my eyeballs, hands, and brain that what I wrote to disk is OK by my standards, if that signature is ever missing or invalid, you can refuse to run the code.
SSL makes no claims to the integrity of the code from my eyeballs, hands, and keyboard to the disk, it merely claims the integrity of the code from the disk to the other person's (receiver's) terminal.
While the code is sitting on my disk, anyone with access to my disk, permitted or otherwise, can modify it.
Also, with compromised keys, an SSL key is more likely to be compromised, as it is sitting on an active server unencrypted, whereas most pgp keys are stored on local terminals and password protected (or more)

Yes, you could, but a lot of requirements.
1. Alice and Bob would both need to be running BTC LN and LTC LN, and both have direct channels with each other.
2. If Alice was trading bitcoin for Bob's Litecoin, Alice would send her signed closing transaction to Bob on LTC LN and Bob would send his signed transaction on BTC LN, then if the two parties agreed on the trade, Alice would send her signed tx on BTC LN and Bob would send his signed tx on LTC LN.
There would be some vectors that could be attacked when doing this without direct channels on both networks. But maybe it's 8am and I need to think harder. lol

Proof of existence just says "This document/file existed at or before a certain point in time delegated by the block in which it was confirmed. By the nature that it is being signed by a specific key, we can assume the owner of that key was in possession of the file at that time."
This only really prevents the "I made this document on December 12th!" (plagarism) and the original author can then say "well, if you made it December 12th, how could I have had it November 8th? (Shows transaction in a block on Nov. 8th where the hash of the file is present signed by their key)

Running the deposits and withdrawals for Ether at the exchange I work at was a pain in the bum during the first era of kitties.
There were times when we literally were just sitting there, staring at each other saying "should we just shut down Ether I/O for a while until things calm down?
We ended up just going into our hotwallet gasPrice logic, and x10 it.
web3.eth.gasPrice??? nope! web3.eth.gasPrice.times(10)
That actually fixed our problems partially... but it seems like Ethereum miners don't pick transactions preferentially in order of gasPrice? Because we kept on getting failures either way...
Bitcoin fees are high, but smart economic fee estimates, rbf on all withdrawals, batching withdrawals, and using segwit has kept our fees down significantly.
The costs saved by implementing those things more than paid for my salary while implementing them. and then some...
Perhaps Coinbase etc. can't hold on to crypto engineers that understand this stuff because....... oh I don't know........ what would be something in recent memory that Coinbase did that anyone with sound technical understanding of how Bitcoin works would find issue with and probably up and leave... hmm, can't think of anything. /s

Not true.


Don't use myTrezor. Many other wallets support Trezor. But no matter which wallet you use, you will need to query your balance to someone's server UNLESS YOU SET UP YOUR OWN SERVER (which you can do). tl;dr if you can't figure out how to run a server, you will have to leak your balance to other people's servers. Think about it. Would you rather have a company based in the Czech Republic, a company based in the USA, a guy based in the USA, or some unknown people in unknown countries with unknown intentions? Trezor labs, Bitpay, the guy who made Multibit, or Electrum servers (can be run by anyone, but most likely the NSA runs a few servers ;-) )
I'd say the easiest server to run on your own would be a Copay server (Bitpay open sourced it, so it shouldn't be hard, just takes time to download the blockchain and parse it)

Other answers have covered the arguments you'll need.

You're telling me I can't use Gmail because the 9 o'clock news said Osama Bin Laden used Gmail once... do you realize how absurd that sounds? I have a passion for this technical advancement that could very well be a source of jobs in 20 years similar to how tech jobs which were considered to be "a bunch of criminal hackers" that are now the booming tech industry that they are today. Your constant disapproval of Bitcoin shows that you give me no credit for my judgement, and have no trust in me. This has caused me emotional confusion and to be honest, I am upset by it."

I disagree. I think that you and I may do this, but the channel aspect needs to be abstracted away for mass adoption.
I think it comes down to whether you believe LN is the last link in the chain to mass adoption or not.
I think that if LN is abstracted well enough, and enough liquidity providers see the value in creating channels with large swaths of new people, LN could be the key to mass adoption of crypto.
My vision in my head reminds me a LOT of the "freemail" boom in the 90s. Up until then no one used email. 20 years later, everyone uses email, for free. (edit: free for the user, but not free for the company running it like google etc. This is key.)
@_date: 2016-04-20 00:13:50
I had an interesting discussion with Nicholas about the subject.
I think you're right, but that in order to gain mass adoption, there will need to be large hubs willing to commit large amounts of bitcoin to newbs who don't have any / will exchange bitcoins over their direct channel in exchange for fiat etc.
It's not the utopian fully distributed mecca like some people say, but then of course neither is the internet, and the internet scaled pretty well.

Alice and Bob open a channel. 10 BTC each. 2 of 2 multisig.

Bob hacks Alice and steals her keys.
Now Bob can withdraw all 20 BTC in the channel immediately without Alice's permission.

Bitcoin transactions have a set size for the amount value in a transaction.
This is known as UINT64 (unsigned 64 bit integer).
64 bits is equivalent to 18,446,744,073,709,551,616... so that is the total number of satoshi's we could count, which is 184 billion bitcoins. We could add three more 0s and still be fine...
However, this data type is not a decimal data type, it's all whole numbers... so we would essentially have to tell the block chain "k, any bitcoins BEFORE xxxx are actually worth 1000x more bitcoin than the bitcoins after it."
It would be a very complicated hard fork.
@_date: 2016-04-08 14:34:18
Only problem, and it's a big one, is security.
Alice and Bob have their keys in memory as a hot wallet. Alice is behind on her security patches, Bob knows her IP address, pokes around and discovers she's vulnerable. Baits her into joining the channel for 10 BTC.
Bam, he steals her keys from memory, signs with both keys and runs with the channel funds.
Maybe the bigger hubs (Coinbase will undoubtedly become one) can afford to buy HSMs... but it's hard to imagine LN being in every smartphone and every PC etc... I do seriously think that a LN channel between Coinbase and Bitpay and other popular payment processors would be nice for Coinbase... but I'll reserve my excitement for LN mobile and LN Moon Version until I see it in action.

Pull out your phone.
Should it say "Show this QR code to others you want to join your wallet BUT YOU CAN TOTALLY JUST USE YOUR PHONE AS THE SECOND KEY KTHXBYE"?


I don't think you are getting how multisig works.
If I have 3 keys of a 2 of 3 multisig sitting on a single device... what is the point of using multiple keys?
To give an example: I could use Copay in 4 ways (Let's say I have 4 main "wallets")
1. Single sig spending wallet. (for buying a pizza at the store etc.)
2. 2 of 2 multisig. (1 key on desktop, 1 key on iPhone, for online shopping, I hold larger amounts in here)
3. Single sig Trezor wallet. (Stores most of my savings)
4. 2 of 3 multisig. (1 key on my Trezor, 1 key on someone else's Trezor, 1 key held by a third party)
All of these wallets have never been seen by Bitpay, not even the public keys. Because Bitpay was kind enough to open source everything including the backend, so I run my own servers.
Coinkite was a service. Their business model was "let's make things easy, and advertise when we have a new feature so people will think our site is so cool." and they made a really nice swiss army knife for you to use.
Copay is a tool. No advertising, no profits, barebones figure it out on your own style. (Their repos also are light on the documentation front as well)... but when you DO figure out how to use it effectively... oh boy does this swiss army knife rock so hard.
Your post was very eye opening at how poor a job Copay does at advertising its most popular use cases.
I guess since they make no money on it, it won't matter if they advertise or not... but still, it is interesting from a UX design perspective.

Still ignores the most crucial part.
Dave could just as easily just receive the payment and not send the product.
The timing of the release of R in order to cheat alice out of funds will:
1. Still end up with Dave getting bad reviews on whatever site. (same as just receiving the money and running)
2. Only serve to be an attempt at breaking LN, but will not affect Alice or any intermediaries in any negative way moreso than if Dave had just received the funds.
I understand OP is trying to break things to allow people to find solutions... good heart, in the right place.
but it's like "I'm 14 and this is deep" meme... "whoa, what if... like... I release the secret and DON'T ACTUALLY TAKE THE MONEY but then I LET EVERYONE ELSE LEADING TO ME TAKE THE MONEY!... whoa, that's like... deep bug dude."

I think for a while you are right...
Options would be to open many small channels or connect to bigger centralization magnets like coinbase (undoubtedly) in order to get enough throughput.
I could even see companies (like "freemail" sites like hotmail and yahoo before gmail) paying the initial bitcoin fees to deposit into your channel without any commitment from you (ie. Coinbase will lock up to 0.01 BTC in your channel with 0 commitment from you and they will pay the deposit fee into the multisig.
Subsequential "top-ups" to their channel will either cost money or you invite friends to join or something, and of course if you have bitcoin you can commit it to the channel as well.
I am not saying they will loan you bitcoin. They will just commit bitcoin to your channel for free so that you can receive money via LN from anyone. (similar to how hotmail wanted to start the email boom by making free mail for anyone)
But time will tell. People like us nerds will have tons of tiny channels decentralized, and grandma will have her own granma (haha, imagine a "domain" structure where nodename,protocol,underlying_crypto_asset)

Currently: Control burn rate
Future: Utilize large user base to create partnerships across the globe. Since breadwallet would hope to be the Facebook to Bitcoin's social media, they could probably negotiate a better deal with joint ventures etc.
From the user perspective, they get a cool new feature for their favorite wallet app, and from breadwallet's perspective, they can leverage for better deals when it comes to rev share on these new features.
But for now, they are doing what 99% of startups in Silicon Valley do. Ask rich people and businesses for money, and try not to spend it all before these sweet deals pull through.
In the meanwhile, their lead developer is making some of THE BEST open sourced SPV mobile software out there. Giving back to the community.
Edit: btw, I went on for a while there, but I'm not sure if that's it. Just letting you know that they're prolly not making money now, but that's not the point.

In order for you to send money to me, I need to generate a secret and send its hash to you.
You ask me for the hash to a new secret (aka announce your payment to me)
I send you the hash.
You and all the intermediaries perform HLTC encumbered transactions.
I get my payment.
If I was offline, I could neither generate the secret nor send you the hash of that secret.

You can't do it within the app.
If you're doing something that requires many addresses, you either: A. Don't really need that many addresses, you just haven't thought hard enough OR B. Have enough programming knowledge to write a simple script generating your keys.
What exactly do you need it for, and how many are you looking to generate?
(Also note: as soon as you start getting payments into addresses far away from your mycelium app, really you can no longer manage these funds with any app unless you code one yourself... So like I said, try thinking up other ways. I can help if you tell me what you plan.)

If you want micro-donations, you can probably afford to have your PC on 24/7. Also, since bitcoin SENDERS pay fees, you have no advantage to use LN since you only want $100+ donations anyways... so just paste your bitcoin address as is.


Again. You're not going to "send money back home" in increments of 1/1000th of a penny every millisecond. You'll send a couple hundred at least.
There is also a very good chance that there could be ways for escrow to work out.
Not to mention, you could share your wallet on your PC and your smartphone. Then only have your smartphone set to "no-relay" mode (meaning you will not route transactions, only receive) and the app will wake up in the background to receive transactions only. (won't eat too much battery)
With trusted execution environments being built into all the latest smartphones, it might not be too dangerous exposing your keys to your mobile device... in fact, it might even be more secure than your PC or a server.

tl;dr a bunch of devs thought it was more important to “stick it to bcash” than to put out stable software.
Or perhaps they had some meeting that went like:
“Oh snap a couple LND people are using mainnet!”
“Well, we want a majority of LN nodes to be c-lightning because Blockstream rulez”
“Ok, c-lightning is buggiest but rather than concentrate on making it not buggy let’s make some Docker based storefront stuff, and then promote it so a ton of developers will set up nodes with c-lightning and get vendor lockin by not wanting to fuss around with closing channels and sending money to a better implementation.”
“Ok cool, how about you work on promoting mainnet use on our blog, but add a line saying we’re not encouraging it.”
“Sounds great, let’s do it.”
“Someone said there was a bug where force closing a channel in c-lightning will cause the other person’s funds to be unspendable, shouldn’t we fix that first?”
“Nahhhh, blog already went out.”
I am guessing it was more of a “stick it to bcash” which would be childish and irresponsible, but if it was a “we want more LN node share, even if it means putting out super buggy software.” Then that’s just irresponsible.
Once the implementations all get mainnet ready, everyone should close all channels and reevaluate which client they really want to use.
Since a bug in the client used to open a channel could be uncloseable in a future version at this point because of all the bug fixes. You want to make sure the channel opens are being done on a stable client.
Look at bitcoin core github commits and pull requests...
Look at c-lightning.
Look at LND.
Look at Eclair.
LND is obviously the winner of “wow this will be the most stable and conservative client similar to the values of Bitcoin Core project.”
LND doesn’t even have a mainnet config option yet because they want to discourage its use.

You are thinking from a technical perspective. "Alice" is not the one adding funds to the channel. HUB is. But the HUB website asks Alice "would YOU like to increase your limit?" because that is easier to understand to the user than "would you like to open a secondary channel with additional funds from our reserves so that you can receive more money through channels with us?"
Again, you are thinking from the perspective of a technical person. It would make more economical sense for people in the 1990's to set up their own server and run their own email 24/7... with drawbacks that they would have to deal with any downtime and micro-manage everything. The channel costing money to open would be a logistics problem for the HUB and not one for the end user.
Also, the assumption being that a majority of users using bitcoin at this point will be on LN, and not many of them will choose to manage bitcoin directly, as every single transaction will cost them money directly, whereas LN through hubs will cost the hub money, which the hub can recoop through advertising, resource sharing, LN payment routing in agregate (because they will have large reserves and large amounts of users, a large number of the total network traffic will flow through them, taking small fees from everyone to maintain the "freemail" users.


Again, the thing is that Alice doesn't know bitcoin. She just sees a shiny payment website that allows her to pay 1/10000 of a cent per hour to get ad-free websites etc. If Bob sends her $5,000 of bitcoin, the utxo is sent to the multisig channel address, but the transaction is first sent to Alice directly, and not through the hub. Alice's browser can then create a new refund transaction referencing the new utxo from the transaction she received via private encrypted data from Bob AND the currently managed utxos in the channel.
From Bob's perspective, it does not matter if he sends to multisig or Alice's single sig... but from Alice's perspective, bitcoin in her single sig are 1. nearly useless to her, as she nearly never uses direct bitcoin transactions. 2. cost her fees too, immediately, as she must then send the utxo minus fees to the multisig anyway. (of course, these fees will eventually be paid by her (or if the hub wants to take on even more of the cost and pay the closing fees too, they might find a reason to do so)


It is a payment hub ON TOP of LN. If the locked reserves are giving them a return, then they will lock as much reserves as is profitable. Similar to how bitcoin is right now, I could imagine a lot of VC money etc. going towards beefing up the LN through these payment hubs. Helping to abstract the "channels" and the other technical aspects away from the end user.


This incentive was also there for email. "No company would want to host a server for millions of freeloaders just using their resources for free. The incentives point towards every grandma running her own SMTP server from her home and not being able to send email to Bobby when his server is down for maintenance." But that is not the way it worked out. Companies saw the value in 1. propping up the tech by taking an initial loss to increase adoption and usability. 2. then once they have large swaths of users on their service, monetize them.
The only difference is that now, if we have a gmail sized payment hub with millions of grandmas with free access to LN (without needing to know what bitcoin is or pay any fees up front) then anyone can send money to their grandma online without explaining what bitcoin is... plus, if a system like Brave browser (paying users for watching ads) is included, the payment hub could take a micro-cut of those revenues to help offset the cost.

Except in order for your grandma to use any device on the LN, she will need to buy bitcoin in order to even start using it.
LN shines with micropayments, but it's biggest hurdle is requiring participants to first muck around with bitcoin, and commit a non-zero amount of money that will limit their future interactions with others based on the total of their channel commitments.
LN needs large hubs to subsidize users so that mass adoption of LN can occur.
I don't pay google for their server costs when I use Gmail. The average layperson will not buy bitcoin to join a network that not used by anyone, so to jump start LN we need the "sign up, it's free" Gmail-type LN client (which is possible while still giving the user control of the private keys of their channel) where I can sign in, and with 0 bitcoin on hand immediately start receiving bitcoin via LN.
But someone has to foot the bill and commit bitcoins to a channel with someone that is committing 0 bitcoins (which is a risk to lose the bitcoin fees entering and exiting the channel, so they'll need to thwart frivolous account creation moreso than Gmail does)
Otherwise, all devices will have to be injected with bitcoin before being shipped or some crazy shit like that, because the only people buying bitcoin to join a pay-to-participate, spending limit extravaganza, are people like me.
If we want to talk pie in the sky, I'd be more than happy to hear your take on the future of LN, but if we want to be realistic, large hubs are a necessity for LN. (Not saying ALL nodes must be connected directly to a large hub, but they serve a purpose on LN as it currently stands.

You are assuming all nodes know everything and act immediately in their best self interest instantaneously.
The "vanilla" implementation of LN won't have a condition where "if randomly a node whose connection is closed just suddenly sends you the secret to which you have received funds encumbered to, immediately switch those to normal funds received"
You would need all members in between you and Dave to have a special "Dave wants to annoy everyone version" of LN that would cooperate with Dave's tomfoolery.

    1055 8.1.2 Bitcoin Cash (BCH or BCC)
    1056 In July 2017, approximately 80 to 90 percent of the Bitcoin computing power voted to
    1057 incorporate Segregated Witness (SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments:
    1058 transactional data, and signature data), which made it possible to reduce the amount of data being
    1059 verified in each block. Signature data can account for up to 65 percent of a transaction block, so
    1060 a change in how signatures are implemented could be useful. Before SegWit was activated, a group
    1061 of people in the Bitcoin community disagreed with the change, so they planned to cause a hard fork.
    1062 This hard fork would be enforced by requiring block number 478559 to be larger than 1 MB. The new rules
    1063 of this network (increase block size to 8 MB) caused two blockchains to emerge from the single blockchain.
    1064 One called "Bitcoin" (BTC) and another called "Bitcoin Cash" (BCH or BCC). When the hard fork occurred,
    1065 people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
I wrote a new one. Tried to be as non-divisive as possible. (Which always gets people upset because they want you to swing it 180 the opposite direction)

From my own experiences I can agree that the only wallets I control from my PC are my hardware wallets or my multisig with Copay (where another key is on my phone)
I just find phones easier to use when scanning QR codes... not to mention most of the times I use bitcoin are at restaurants etc. where they have a tablet out with a QR code.
Also, I think, just in general, a large number of people who are getting into bitcoin and immediately run for a desktop client without using hardware are (most likely) investor types who have no desire to use bitcoin, and just hodl it.

That's not how the commitment transaction works.
1. If the mempool is clogged, you will have an even longer time to punish the other party, as the timer starts when their cheating transaction is CONFIRMED. Not when it is SEEN in the mempool.
2. Fees for the most recent state can be changed and negotiated, but fees for old states (this is how they try to steal from you) can not change the fees... so unless the fees were very high when you made the old state, it is more likely that they'd have to wait a long time to get confirmed and start the timer for their cheat to succeed.
3. The cheating transaction is immediately redeemable for the person being cheated, so it would be easy for me to dedicate some of the funds I will confiscate from you to CPFP the transaction into confirmation and confiscate your funds as punishment for trying to steal.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:40:09
I don’t think it will be confusing at all.
1. Lightning node preinstalled in all home routers.
2. Easy app for mobile/ extension for browsers that auth with your home router from inside or outside your LAN.
3. Put spending cash in there, browser extension automatically pays sub satoshi per second payments to some streaming website or something.
4. For slightly larger payments it will ask you for confirmation and you click yes, instant confirmation.
5. Someone tries to cheat you? You get instant use of your bitcoins on chain PLUS any bitcoins the cheater had. And your router always being online you don’t even need to hire one of those nifty watchtower thingies that can watch for cheaters on your behalf, anonymously.
6. The cheated funds can be put into a new channel immediately, and you probably made back however much the extra fees cost you by taking the cheat’s money as punishment.
7. All this is automated in the router.
Or it could be a plug and play device made by Trezor and open source the designs and schematics. Just plug into router and go.
Hubs will spring up? Hmmm, if all my friends are online 24/7 thanks to a router or router connected device, There’s really no need to seek out hubs unless you use some store a whole bunch and 1 satoshi fees have got you down on your luck.

$15 is high. $4 is a gamble with a real good chance you might get stuck for a week... but with a high enough chance that it might be worth it to gamble if you have access to features like RBF or CPFP.
$5 is fine right now. usually gets in the next few blocks.
$15 would be like "OMG I NEED TO GET IN THE NEXT BLOCK WITH A 99% CHANCE OF SUCCESS OR ELSE MY MOM WILL GET SHOT!!!!" levels of conservatism.
There's almost no chance $15 for a 1 input 2 output transaction to NOT get in the next block right now.

What is the incentive to use a cold wallet / hot wallet system? Why not just ONLY use my Trezor and don't even bother having a phone wallet?
Answer: That's totally up to you. If you can figure out a way to use Trezor that works for you where you don't need a phone wallet, awesome.
Similarly, if you don't care about fees and don't mind paying them, staying on chain is totally fine.
Most of us other people would rather pay $4 to open a channel and use that one channel to transact back and forth 100s or 1000s of times, maybe if we're unlucky or bad timing, we'll have to top it up or take some out... but $4 x 7 is waaaay better than $4 x 100.
We could go on a whole back and forth about "nuh uh!" "yah huh!" about whether or not lightning users will actually be able to survive off one channel alone... but imo, if you don't want to route, only accept and make channels to one other node, that way you'll be on the far edge and there would be no possible route through you.
@_date: 2016-04-09 00:58:12
There are apps that you could make that utilize Bitcoin and also have the same demerits, yes.
The point is that not all bitcoin apps need to have this demerit, as many apps only store public keys online and use a password or passphrase or some other not-always-online information to work.
However, lightning network will require keys to be online and ready at any given time, otherwise you won't be able to route payments.
If you won't route payments, then only Coinbase etc. will... And that's not decentralization.
So you basically need everyone to put up tons of money in hot wallets in order to make the network function properly.
I'm all for LN. I just loathe the whole "LN is the perfect solution and all will be fine from the get go."

Currently 99% of people coming on mainnet are doing so explicitly to buy some sticker or something from a specific vendor.
So obviously they’ll make one channel with one node. And obviously the 2-3 places where these “use LN on mainnet lol” blogposts are located will become highly centralized nodes.
Currently the only people using LN are devs looking to buy a sticker etc.
Saying “durr hurr LN is centralized” by looking at a current graph is the exact same as saying “durr hurr LN is decentralized” by looking at that same graph.
tl;dr that’s not “the lightning network”
It’s “the buy some stickers to ‘stick it to bcash for the lolz’ network” currently.

Good points.
I have been in contact with NIST and they are very receptive to the changes everyone has been sending in.
As long as you are civil, and don’t hide behind anonymity (I told them my name and title at the public company I work for) they are actually very responsive.
If you would like, here’s the current version that they’ve given me based on everyone’s feedback. If you could give some comments I can forward them onward.
8.1.2      Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
In 2017, Bitcoin users adopted an improvement proposal for Segregated Witness (known as SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments: transactional data, and signature data) through a soft fork. SegWit made it possible to store transactional data in a more compact form while maintaining backwards compatibility.  However, a group of users had different opinions on how Bitcoin should evolve – and developed a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain titled Bitcoin Cash. Rather than implementing the SegWit changes, the developers of Bitcoin Cash decided to simply increase the blocksize. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:39:01
Because any coin where someone can come out and say:


What's to stop them from saying:


Sure, I would have enjoyed a HF upgrade to Segwit along with a 2MB blocksize increase (effectively 8MB)... but there was no consensus, and I'd rather hold a coin where consensus is not fucked with than a coin where "consensus" means one benevolent (?) dictator uploads huge diffs and tells people to run them next day.

All ready to go, just waiting for an end user wallet to be ready so we can recommend it to users.
Also waiting for LND to officially be “mainnet ready”... as it would be  for an exchange to encourage users to risk mainnet funds.
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:45:21
The only "benevolent dictator" scenario I've been able to stomach in the crypto space was Vitalik and Ethereum.
Why? Because he is staking his name on it. Not anonymous. He was a huge presence in the bitcoin community before creating Ethereum. Their development process is also very clear, gives ample time for planned hard forks, has a great replay protection mechanism.
However, I do find it funny how Ethereum is working with so many banks and large financial industries on setting up private Ethereum networks for prototyping, and no one bats an eye... and yet Bitcoin is filled with "ZOMG BORGSTREAM IS BANKER WET DREAM LN IS BANKER WET DREAM ZOMG WE'RE OBSESSED WITH BANKER'S AND THEIR SLEEP EJACULATE." and whatnot... lol

Import or sweep doesn’t matter.
The point is there is no standard for encoding segwit info into private keys, so Samourai has to make a silly UI box for choosing what type of address.
My point is “don’t use those sites, because they are making addresses that 99% of wallets will not generate when the WIF private key is scanned.
If everything was done the Samourai way we’d need to have a drop down box with every possible way of spending with a private key. That’s not how it should work.
A WIF key or extended private key should have encoded information telling the wallet how it should utilize that key. Not have the user “who probably wouldn’t know segwit from a stick in the mud” pick a weird tech term from a list of weird tech terms.
So to avoid confusion (as it seems the OP is realtively new) I would recommend OP not to use these sites.
tl;dr can you scan it and have the wallet automatically know how to spend it? No? Then don’t.

I think, again, you are under the impression that the LN will be perfectly decentralized with equal amounts on both sides of every channel and routing will be super complex.
I think that this is not how the topography of the network will settle in the long run.
Here's how a new user will sign up, receive bitcoins via LN, spend them somewhere else via LN, add extra funds to the channel, and close the channel.
1. User signs up with hub.bit which is a website, through their browser.
2. After confirming email, the user sets up an account with HUB. The user's browser automatically notices this and generates keys in the background and stores them in the secure area. Pubkeys generated and sent to HUB. They generate the multisig, send to the browser, the browser verifies the multisig and pre-signs the return transaction for HUB using the user's key.
3. HUB has commited 0.001 btc to the channel. user 0.
4. The website diplays "FREE ACCOUNT" (using $0 (or 0JPY) of your $400 receive limit. Balance = $0) (wishful thinking ;-P)
5. Someone sends Alice (we'll call the user Alice) 0.0001 btc.
6. Site says "Balance $40, Receive limit $360"
7. Someone wants to send $500 to Alice.
8. Site could notify Alice and say "You have a pending $500 incoming, pay $0.001 per extra $100 to increase your receive limit to accommodate."
9. Alice taps "ok" and her browser automatically updates the channel with the server to give back $0.002 in order to get the limit high enough.
10. Once the limit is increased, HUB contacts the sender's HUB-like company OR their decentralized awesome 1337 node and says "response code xxx OK FOR SEND" along with the hash of the secret for routing. The routing secret is stored in Alice's device.
11. The payment gets routed to HUB. They ask for the secret, get it, and the payment is completed.
12. Alice's nephew Bob decides he wants to send Granma on a vacation and will send $5,000. (Alice is old)
13. Alice opens the HUB account "Deposit funds" link which has options for AML/KYC style Paypal deposits (which will make HUB commit more to the channel and give them to Alice) OR bitcoin deposits, showing the multisig. Bob sends $5,000 to the multisig and it is added to the channel as Alice's balance.
14. Alice decides she wants to use breadwallet to take her $5,039.999 on a trip to the bahamas.
15. Clicks "close out", agrees to pay the fees for the closing transactions.
16. Gets her raw bitcoin funds.
So from her perspective, she used an online bank showing her $ or Yen, or whatever (assuming by the time we moon, bitcoin is stable enough for slight variations in the balance seen as acceptable) and the only real "new concept" is 1. she needs to understand $5000 might waver between $4950 and $5050 over a span of a few weeks. 2. she needs to understand that she has a "receiving limit"
2 would be the biggest hurdle... but I have confidence that sites will be able to abstract that away. (edit: if you told me that google would to freemail and offer 5 GB of mail storage when i first signed up for hotmail, I'd call you crazy... maybe they'll be able to commit thousands of dollars per user and the user won't have to think about it ever again... I don't know. it depends.)
because these hubs would have so many users attached to them, a lot of payments would route through them and thus they make money by gathering new users who have never used bitcoin in their lives.
Do you see what I am envisioning?
Sure, it's not a super crypto-anarchist future, and maybe a govt. crackdown on domestic LN hubs could happen and might happen... but for that we always have bitcoin to fall back on, and non-hub LN nodes will exist, but it will just make UX much harder because there's no VC money behind my node...
*memo: must start seed round for my first LN node and corner the market :-D*

It's not saying it's required. It's saying that if your channel is used up (aka 100% of balance is on the other end, so you can't send anymore)
Log into your exchange or some other service that is holding funds for you or will sell you bitcoins in exchange for something that is also using Lightning.
Then just ask them to pay you in lightning... your single channel then will go from 0% - 100% to 30% - 70% (assuming you bought and received 30% of your channel space on the exchange w/e) and now you can send to others using your 30% again.
You could theoretically never close the channel and only use one channel for the rest of your life as long as your exchange keeps rebalancing its channels (which it will keep to a minimum by having larger channels to begin with) and you never spend more than the maximum bandwidth of your channel.
But how actual real people will use it down the road? idk... who knows?
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:28:39
Sure you can sell.
When you sell BTC on our platform, we do nothing on the blockchain. That’s how exchanges work.
The only time exchanges touch the blockchain are when users deposit to us or we withdraw to the users.
We can let them sell the BTC because as soon as the lightning payment is done, there is no need to close the channel.
The only time we would need to close the channel is if someone we had a channel with tried to cheat us, or if we had some weird situation where we couldn’t just splice in or out funds.
Those situations will be more frequent in the beginning when the network is underdeveloped.
But those situations have nothing to do with “ability to trust received payments”
Once the lightning payment is done, we will add it to your BTC balance immediately.

probably because BIP38 as a standard was only a draft and then was abandoned... then a bunch of sites implemented it anyways...
So hey, if you want to write a NEW BIP that defines how to encode the information of: "After decrypting, please use segwit" into the key itself, that would be a great help to everyone certainly...
though most of the BIP38 tools are extremely old and not maintained... so getting one of those tools to add the new segwit BIP38 format (BIP?? or whatever we call it) will be like pulling teeth.

Currently, if I have a channel with Alice where my balance is only 50 satoshis, but I have a channel with Bob where my balance is 500000 satoshis, I would need to touch the blockchain to try and move my funds from one channel to the other. (So that I have more funds spread out equally, increasing my success rate of routing payments.)
With channel factories, if Alice, Bob, and I are all members of the same channel factory, I can take satoshis from my balance on Bob’s channel and move it to my balance on Alice’s channel without touching the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:52:10
Because no one thinks it’s a good idea.
The general consensus is that paper wallets and BIP38 encrypted wallets are deprecated and should no longer be used, so creating a new site that lets you generate them with new Segwit addresses would be like saying “ok, we don’t want you to use it, but we’ll update it anyways.”
But like I said, if you think it’s a good idea write a BIP.
You are your own boss.

luckily for you, terms like "fully deployed" and "market dominance" and "winning" are completely subjective meaningless terms that you can bend any way you choose.
"durrr, look, our coin makes a smiley face when you look at it on a full moon, THAT MEANS WE'RE WINNING! oh, and lightning network is only used at every major retail store in the world... THAT MEANS CENTRALIZED HUBS OMG, NO ONE USES LIGHTNING EXCEPT ILLUMINATI! oh look, someone made a coin that can instamine 5 trillion coins and some low volume zero fee exchange sold one for $100 dollars to itself. THAT MEANS THAT COIN NOW HAS 99.99% MARKET DOMINANCE OMG!"
Hyperbole for effect, but you get what I mean.
In your eyes, Lightning Network will NEVER be "fully deployed on mainnet" because that's the narrative you've chosen to believe and most likely have staked a large amount of money buying a coin that is dependent on Lightning Network never working.

switching a normal single sig wallet from legacy to segwit gives you a 38%-54% discount depending on how many inputs you have. The more inputs you have the more signatures you're keeping out.
For multisig, let's say 15 of 15 multisig. It's 68%-73% 68% being for one input and 73% being for a ton of inputs.
These calculations all assume native segwit, not segwit-in-P2SH.
So most users will see a 38%-40% reduction on their fees in the short term...
but the main reason why "segwit will lower fees" is because once everyone uses segwit there will be enough space in the block even at 1 MB to keep fee pressure from building up... meaning that the fee rate you pay as a multiplier to your byte size will go down.
Right now fees can fluctuate from 140 s/byte to 500 s/byte within the span of a few hours (over 200% increase)... so the 38% byte decrease does not help the individual in the short term too much.
I love segwit. Let's hope it gets more widely adopted soon.

This is the power of decentralization. Any person or company can modify Bitcoin in any way they want, and have it reviewed. There’s no guarantee your code will get merged, and if you don’t like it, fork it.
Anyone that forked and is sticking around and complaining about Bitcoin are just sour that their fork didn’t gain price dominance over Bitcoin. It’s almost like some government is buying social media presence because they fear Bitcoin.
It’d be like ElementaryOS being upset that it didn’t gain market dominance over Ubuntu. Don’t cry about it, make your thing better.
To anyone saying “durr hurr 5 gatekeepers”
Ummm, ok, give me commit access to Bitcoin-ABC please? No? Ok, then your coin is centralized by your own argument.
(Oh and 2 other repositories supporting your altcoin doesn’t matter. There are tons of full node implementations of bitcoin. That’s not a valid “decentralization” argument for BCH if it’s not valid for BTC)
Also, my BCH transaction didn’t get confirmed in the next block like you guys promised. Better raise the blocksize limit again, buddies.

Sure. That would be nice, but it’s not “needed.”
“datacenters” is a broad term, and similar to mining pools, as long as the datacenter nodes are distributed among a bunch of providers that are all based in jurisdictions around the world, it’s not that big of a problem.
but again, it would be nice to have every person in the world run a node. But after a while there are diminishing returns.
The important part: if suddenly governments across the world crack down on full nodes, we need something that can run on a small raspberry pi concealed beneath the floorboards talking through tor.
Once all our crypto loses that ability, governments win.

Although imo, lightning will be best used by exchanges.
I work at an exchange, and 98% of our withdrawals are to known addresses of other exchanges.
If we had channels with all the exchanges, it would probably be some insane back and forth on those channels...

Just to throw some real numbers at you:
1. I have opened 3 channels thus far, so I paid 3 on-chain tx fees. Each were about $0.10 each ish.
2. Since then, I have made 3 purchases of $30, $10, and $45 through those channels.
3. Then, I had someone pay me back for beers ($15 ish) through one of those channels.
4. Then, I had someone that needed cash and paid me $10 through one of those channels.
5. Then I bought a couple of small things (a few cents x 10 times) (hint: it was a game of sorts ;-) )
6. Then I bought another $10 gift card through the channels.
Overall I paid $0.30 on chain fees. and 3 satoshis in lightning fees. Compared to on-chain where I would have paid maybe a couple dollars total (the onchain fees went up a bit during that time)... (including the fact I wouldn't have paid for the money I received either way.)

I didn't say "required" or "must"... "will want" means "eventually there could be a soft fork you want to be able to verify, then you will want to upgrade"
Hard forks require consensus from all economic nodes. True.
Soft forks can be pushed through violently (and with lots of collateral damage) via 34% of mining power or rather painlessly with 95%, but if a super majority of mining power supports a soft fork, you won't have to verify it, yeah, but it will happen whether you like it or not.
ie. there are still nodes that don't verify segwit signatures, and just view them as "anyone can spend" outputs... but if they try to spend them, the miners, who all verify segwit, will reject them. And any block made with such transactions in them.
@_date: 2019-07-07 11:23:48


Assuming the node software is Bitcoin Core, no. Upkeep is near zero. I say near because if there's ever a soft fork you will want to upgrade. But that's about it. Stop node, update, start node, done.
As a part of my job I have been managing "full nodes" for various cryptos, and 99% of my time is spent on coins like Ethereum that are very unstable and crash all the time. (Even in "light mode" they crash... I thought that would help)
The amount of times where I needed to care about our Bitcoin node outside of the occasional upgrade was one time someone was doing some mass migration effort for our backend servers and I had to fix something they messed up via the migration...
So it wasn't even the software's fault.
We did run a btcd node for a while to test out some lightning stuff using Neutrino, but it was not nearly as stable. Requiring some sort of intervention once a week or so. LND was solid though...
I would say if you're going to have any issues, it'll be with LND.

Not if you compile the app from github.
If you download the app directly from the app store, there is a non-zero chance a hacker could steal the developer's credentials and upload an "update" to the app that steals private keys.
Your head is in the right place.
But under the assumption that even if the app developers got hacked or turned rogue... I don't put life-ending amounts of money in my phone wallet anyways.
As for Trezor, they are super anal about security, and all their employees are known to the public. I would recommend against buying from a retailer and buy directly from SatoshiLabs. If you have the ability, compile your own firmware and verify the source. (everything is open source so you can DIY)
Most mobile apps are also open source and you can easily compile them yourself if you'd like.

Looking at the mempool there are tons of transactions that skip 5-6 fee levels and choose super high fees.
This is primarily because many wallets use the outdated estimatefee rpc call which is a very poor estimate of fees needed (it’s too high during normal and lowering fee periods, and too low during periods of sharply rising fees.)
Wallet apps should have a bidding system where every wallet is aware of the fees for all transactions waiting in the mempool of that wallet or its provider. Then if you want to get in the next block aim for the 50% mark (500kb transactions more fees than yours) with rbf enabled and every minute or so check your position. Bumping up fees when needed to push your transaction to the 50% mark. Someone willing to wait for 2 blocks should aim for 1500kb, then once a block is found, aim for 500kb.
If every wallet did this, we would see average fees overall go way down during slow periods and WAAAAY up during periods of congestion (might need to place a maximum on absolute fees or fee rate to prevent a global bidding war to infinity), but the drawbacks on the wallet developer side (=complexity and difficulty to implement) and the drawbacks on the user side (=not knowing the final fee until confirmed, needing a reliable connection to the server every minute or so.) make a wallet like this difficult.
Using the gasoline tank example: we need a 5000000000 L tank but we only have a 1 L tank. The solution is not “install a 500000000 L tank” but rather “make the vehicle strong enough to support a 5000000000 L tank AND/OR make it efficient enough to where we only need a 50 L tank. THEN install a 50 L tank.

open `C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin` and create a text file called `bitcoin.conf`
inside that file write the following:
    dbcache=2000
    assumevalid=00000000000000000040514f42e3a5dd4a973d588267529c0436765046a2743c
change the 2000 value after dbcache to be 50% of your computer's RAM.
If you have 4GB RAM, set to 2000, 8GB RAM set to 4000 etc. (the number is in MB)
You can check that the block I set for assumevalid is valid by checking it on as many block explorers as you want:
This will speed things up considerably.
Edit: once you save the file, shut down bitcoin core and restart it for it to take effect (make sure notepad isn't actually saving it as bitcoin.conf.txt... it must be called bitcoin.conf)

Sorry your wallet gave you bad fee estimates... :-(
1. go to 
2. scroll to bottom "Mempool size in MB"
3. click 100-120 in the legend, that will hide all fee levels below the one you clicked.
4. keep clicking around til you only show the levels that are shrinking every time a block is found.
5. Set your satoshis/byte to the bottom end of the level above that.
6. Use segwit if possible. (40-55% discount)

You need to know the history of Copay wallet:
1. It was SOLELY for multisig. (a long time ago)
2. Multisig requires communication and cooperation among participants, so to do this they made the multisig participants share an encryption key that was passed via QR code, this shared encryption key would be used to encrypt ALL data sent to the server.
3. Then multisig people could send proposals to the server ie. "hey, guys, want to send x BTC to address y?" and the other participants could vote with their signatures. If enough people reject, the signatures are all deleted, but the record of the rejected proposal stays on the server, encrypted, for all the participants to see.
4. This kind of cooperation was the first of its kind. Electrum only added their multisig stuff AFTER Copay did this. It was revolutionary at the time.
5. People asked Copay to support single sig wallets.
6. Rather than create a new paradigm for single sig all together, they derive the encryption key from your recovery phrase using a special path, and all your wallet data is encrypted before uploading.
7. With single sig, the benefits are much smaller... HOWEVER, there are a FEW cool things you can do (but most people don't) with this model.
8. For example, you can give someone a public-only copy of your copay wallet, they can import it and they will be able to generate addresses on your behalf (which other wallets can do) but NOT ONLY THAT they can use the proposal system from multisig and CREATE A SPEND PROPOSAL. (so you could give your secretary the public copay copy, they could create a proposal with a memo saying "this is the payment to abc" and since the proposal is signed and encrypted using the "shared encryption key" you know the proposal came from someone who you shared the public-only wallet with.) Now all you need to do is click "approve"... ironically this would have prevented Bitpay's phishing attack problem in 2015... Getting bitcoin addresses via email and trusting that is a big nono, using signatures and securely sending encrypted data via BWS servers is much better.
Source: I worked on Copay for 2 years.
Edit: if you have any questions about the way Copay works (not "well that's stupid" or "why did you do that?" as I was not the decision maker, I was just a random volunteer from outside of Bitpay, so I can only speculate) let me know
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:52:21
You would only need them for transacting (both sending AND receiving) but currently the only wallets don't support things like Trezor / independent punishment watching. (Which would both be necessary to use Trezor with Lightning.)
But to be honest, your Lightning wallet should be similar to your mobile wallet you use currently. You only put pocket money in there.
No one will be storing 5000 bitcoins on Lightning. Not even exchanges imo.

How much is “ample fee?”
Miners look at the average satoshi per byte of all dependencies when adding transactions.
ie. If your first transaction was 100 bytes at 1 satoshi/byte and your second transaction was 100 bytes at 3 satoshis/byte. 100 satoshis + 300 satoshis / 200 bytes = 2 satoshis/byte average for the two transactions together. Miners will see the 200 byte 2 transaction chunk as one huge 2 satoshi/byte transaction.
What were the byte sizes and fees of both transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:12:49
These are all just suggestions. I’ve never heard the groceries line, but it wouldn’t surprise me if people did that.
You can put however much you want in it. And I’m sure the amount you would be comfortable with will grow as devices like Trezor and Ledger integrate with it.

@_date: 2017-12-24 17:10:39
Yea, you’ll need to do that either way.
The bright side: if everyone uses lightning enabled wallets, they will be using segwit, so any on-chain transactions will use less block space, and since a lot of exchanges and high volume places will get off chain and onto the lightning network, less transactions on chain, meaning 2 cent fees will be a thing again.
So yeah, 2 cents to open a channel, then use the channel(s) like a prepaid card. Top up when needed, except with lightning, you can send and receive instead of only sending.

Ironically, the regulations they DON'T WANT TO REPEAL are the ones that prevent competition.
NN is just there to prevent stupid fuckery from the existing monopolies.
I would be cool with NN repeal under the two conditions:
1. Remove all the state legislation on wiring infrastructure that was engineered to prevent new ISPs from starting up.
2. Wait 5 years for the competition to show up, maybe give some incentives. Then let competition police the market. Repeal NN.
Repealing NN right now would just mean that ISPs will cut out turfs, price gouge, and you will pay MORE for your internet within a year.

2. Your wife would not be your dependent if you cash out and she has a yearly income because of it over 1.3 mil. She will have to enter her own health insurance etc. independent of you.
3. Tax ministry has clarified their stance, all profits are reported as miscellaneous income, (keep in mind, misc. income is the only income that is isolated from loss sharing. If you write off a huge loss, you can’t take it away from your salary income tax etc.) giving concrete examples: a) Coin to fiat AND coin to other coin AND coin to goods are all taxed based on yen price at time of transaction. b) Miners must report 100% of mining rewards as income at the price when they receive the reward.

Simple thought exercise:  
You're a miner with a good chunk of the mining power, or maybe you're on speaking terms with a super majority of the miners.
Block 42 has a transaction with a single 10000 BTC fee and an OP\_RETURN message saying "thanks miners for all you do, love me"  
Cool, we know it's not a mistake so take that fee with a clear conscience, huzzah, said the miner...
But let's say there's only 10 miners and each has 1/10 of the power, and you got the fee (because you were lucky)  
The other 9 miners could say "why don't WE just take the exact same transactions, so everyone thinks it's just a natural reorg, and re-mine it so one of US can get it and split the fee 9 ways."
Cool! So 9 miners collude, steal the fee from the other miner, and no one is the wiser. Maybe even the miner might shrug shoulders and say oh well I guess I just had an orphan, oh well.

No one is saying “make things 10 times more expensive”
The equivalent of what OP proposes in your dollar analogy would be “ok, anyone who has 10 dollars now has 100 dollars. All bank account amounts will be multiplied by 10, and any dollar bills that have a serial number less than XXXXXX will be worth 10x the printed value.
So sure “an apple costed 50 cents but now it costs 5 dollars!” Would be true. But at the same time everyone holding 500 dollars now holds 5000 dollars so it evens out.
Bitcoin wallets actually don’t understand Bitcoin as a unit. All transaction data uses 1/100000000 of a bitcoin (a “satoshi” as it is called) to measure amounts.
So I would still have the same number of satoshis, we would just agree as a society to call 100 satoshis “one bitcoin” instead of 100000000 satoshis like we currently do.
Prices would adjust accordingly... but to be honest, no one prices goods in bitcoin. They calculate the current value at time of purchase.

Schnorr signatures and Channel factories will make Lightning Network even more usable. Rebalancing channels without touching the blockchain, but easily enforceable at any point with the most recent state on the blockchain.
With schnorr signatures... the whole network could be a gigantic channel factory (let's say 1000 participants) which would be a schnorr 1000-of-1000 multisig that splits out into tons of sub-trees, splicing members out as they become unresponsive, occasionally hitting the blockchain to merge more people into the group... and each time it hits the blockchain, the transaction is a fixed size regardless of the number of participants.
channel factories still need tons of work to become a reality... but schnorr signatures are just around the corner, maybe a year or two, and lightning (with normal 2of2 bidirectional channels) is probably within a month.
So much win.

1. If you cash out using your account but file taxes on her name that is fraud. But since you clarified that your wife has her own account, that would not be fraud. However, if the tax man wanted to get you, they could probably try to say that you “giving” your wife the coins was a taxable event. (“Gift tax”  )
2.    tl;dr, you lose your spousal deduction AND since she has her own income now you can not report her as your dependent, which means she would need to get her own health insurance. I’m assuming your wife doesn’t work at all, so it’s not surprising you don’t know, but stop with the attitude, I’m just trying to help.

Yup, currently those decision makers are the core dev team.
Sure, you can create your own policies for a lot of this stuff... But a large portion on the network blindly downloads the latest Bitcoin Core.
This is a form of centralization.
Which is why more implementations of the consensus mechanisms with varying node policies must exist.

The r value is basically just a public key where you throw away the private key before sending the transaction.
1. If you know the k value (which is the private key to r's public key) then you can calculate the private key that made the signature.
2. If you know two transactions which use the same private key to sign AND both have the same r values, then you (and anyone else who sees those two transactions on the blockchain) can calculate the private key.

1. You download copay on another device and import the backup. Their backup format is proprietary, so unless you know how to manually extract the private keys (which you could find out, it's all open source) you are only able to import it to another copay client.
2. You can't currently. You would need to use another wallet to sweep it, then send it to your copay wallet.
3. No. Only the user-end client stores the private keys. The private keys along with the public keys of all participants in the multisig wallet (if that's what youre using) are encrypted in your backup file. Private keys are NEVER sent to the server, so make a backup!
4. By yourself? No. :::::: Using multiple devices that you own in a multisig? Maybe, but you have to be very careful with what passwords you use to encrypt each backup (yes, you need to make one backup for EACH PARTICIPANT) and don't store all them on the same place etc etc... but leaning towards no :::::::: using multiple friends / trustees to distribute keys in your multisig? Maybe, but you need to trust that the other people don't collude against you to steal your bitcoins, AND you need to make sure everyone manages their backups properly. If you lose n-m-1 keys collectively, no more access to the bitcoins forever.

the private key was a 301 redirect response from random.org's http API call. Since the app thought random.org would always give it random numbers, so much so that they PURPOSEFULLY SET REDIRECTS TO BE IGNORED, that when random.org only gave them a message saying roughly "Hey, stop accessing random.org via http you dummy!" to everyone that accessed it. That message itself became the private key that everyone used, and people with the same private key can't be trusted to share and play nice... so people steal the bitcoin before the victim can realize it's the bug address...
The funny thing is... you would be pressed to prove that as theft. I mean, if the right to move bitcoin is the ownership of the private key... then the knowledge of the phrase "301 redirect..." is public knowledge, and therefore any bitcoins sent there is public domain...
Bitcoin and the concept of ownership are pretty hard to mix.

However, it seems XMLHttp errors are prevalent as of late (which = maybe their servers are having downtime a lot / could go down for good someday)

No. You can not "combine" private keys. 2 of 3 will have 3 private keys, but you only need 2 to send.

Your idea is great. It sounds very similar to BIP32, however, BIP32 does address generation sequentially instead of using a hash of some order etc.
Reasons why I think that using BIP32 and storing the key index value on your DB with the order hash instead of using the order hash in your derivation:
1. Collision chance. You might give the same address to two customers depending on what you hash of the order.
2. Table of order hashes just became a part of your backup, which is hard to backup analog, while BIP32 (thanks to BIP39) is just one phrase written on a piece of paper.

Copay looks at the Bitcoin network and estimates how much fees per byte is necessary to confirm at a reasonable time. "Priority" setting is targetting confirmation within 1 block, "Normal" is 2 blocks, and "Economy" is 6 blocks.
Copay has done nothing wrong.
What was wrong was whatever wallet you used to send TO your Copay. It did not look at the SIZE OF THE TRANSACTION, and only stuck a flat fee on it, (which leads me to believe a human who didn't understand how fees work chose the fee manually) which caused the transaction from wallet XXX TO Copay to be stuck in limbo. This then, in turn, caused any subsequent transaction to ALSO be stuck in limbo... (no matter how many fees the second one had)
Also, this question was already answered on Github 3 hours ago.

Companies like bitwage should send multiple transactions to random combinations of addresses generated by the customer's xpub in random amounts. These transactions should be staggered throughout a few hour period along with every other customer's transactions.
If you reuse the same address every time AND use that address to buy things (or even if you send a small amount to your other wallet to send) people will wise up and be able to figure out your salary.
It's not money laundering, as they have your personal details, they are just making it so you don't have to give away your salary every time you buy coffee.
I equate it to living in a cash only society where dollar bills can be any denomination and your work gives you a single dollar bill in the amount of your whole salary. Ok now you have to split it up and tumble it and maybe you might tumble with questionable people's dollars and stores might look at the dollar blockchain and report you as suspicious etc.
Merge avoidance is key when it comes to your salary.

define precisely the boundary between working and not working. How do you quantitatively measure decentralization?
Then, unless we are past some theoretical point of diminishing returns on the decentralization scale (doubtful, as 3 pools could kill decentralization right now) it would stand to reason that if increasing blocksize increases centralization, then decreasing blocksize would decrease centralization.
Therefore we should LOWER the blocksize immediately and the expected result would be everyone starts mining on their CPUs and decentralization is saved.

Yes. The hardcore mining community sees everything in kW/h/GH (kilowatt hours per gigahash)
You pay x cents per kilowatt hour to your electric company, and for every kilowatt hour the hardware consumes it produces an average amount of hashes y.
Now you just need to convert y hashes into an estimated bitcoin return (which is hard, as pool mining is very complicated, and payout schedules differ, rules to decide payout division vary, some pools find more blocks than others and that means more money for less hashes for their members. (This is a gamble, as who finds the block is a random event))
Once you do that you will see that anything that runs off USB power is way too inefficient.
If you want to ever dream of seeing a fraction of a bitcoin large enough to buy a cup of coffee, your initial investment in parts and electricity until first payout will be AT LEAST $1000. Oh, and a lot of scams promise super awesome equipment, then never send, so be sure to use escrow wherever possible.

Where in the blockchain is the data for the string "1A5dxi2KXoMPwp75XTFPBUdK3EVfUmit4p"?
That's because an address does not mean anything to the blockchain. You can't put an address directly into a bitcoin transaction as is. That's not how bitcoin works.
To the blockchain, the hash contained within the address could be used in any one of a billion different ways. We humans (or more specifically, the wallet apps) are the ones that look at the address, derive meaning from it and convert it into something the blockchain (and the nodes that maintain it) can understand.

(be sure to only enter the json object starting and ending with {}... I have done no cleaning of the inputs, so an extra space would probably throw an error, sorry)
I just made one for you with the sjcl.js found [here]( 
You can take these xprvs you extract and plug them into my site here:
Into the BIP32 Extended Key box. (it will override the BIP39 stuff as long as you don't touch anything up there)
Then go down to the Custom path setting box. type in `m/45'/2147483647/0/0` and write down the Public Key (Hex)
Write down the same path pubkey for each xprv.
Then sort those 3 pubkeys in order from low value to high value. so 03xxx... will always be after than 02xxx... etc.
Go to  and in the New &gt; Transaction dialogue input the following:
    5221 &lt;pubkey1&gt; 21 &lt;pubkey2&gt; 21 &lt;pubkey3&gt; 53ae
Where the order 1 2 3 is the ascending order of value. (and remove all spaces once you placed them in there)
Coinbin will generate the p2sh address and check it's balance for you.
(if you didn't find any bitcoins on it, try `m/45'/2147483647/0/1`, `m/45'/2147483647/0/2`, `m/45'/2147483647/0/3` with the method above for all xprvs.)
You can then assign the inputs and set outputs, then you can sign it in the sign page, you can get the private keys from the "Private Key (WIF)" of the places you got the pubkeys to begin with.
Both mine and coinbin's sites can be downloaded from github (mine includes the decrypter and the pathfinder) and all done offline.
However, coinbin needs to find input data from online to make a transaction for you.

You're making the incorrect assumption that going from the 24 word phrase to the master private key, then generating the first private key, calculating the public key, then the address, then querying the blockchain for balance of that address is all performed with a single sha256 hash.
Not to mention that 1/256 isn't totally accurate, as the attacker doesn't start with a list of all correct checksummed combinations, and will need to decode the phrase and check using sha256 the other 255/256. Which is a lot less work than the previous paragraph, but still work.

No. CLTV is absolute time not relative time... so when you create the transaction you would need to pick a date (static) in time, and ANY POINT AFTER THAT TIME THE TRANSACTION IS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER NORMAL ONE.
The cool thing about CLTV, is you can use it with P2SH, so to everyone, they'll see "oh look, bitcoins in a "3" address, prolly multisig! Then BAM!! Turns out it was an address that can't be spent from until 2020 May 4th 12:32AM UTC.

Someone with a good base of knowledge of Bitcoin could code up some software that takes thousands of private keys and creates an auto-forward wallet.
The only problem is that those private keys would need to be online at all times... It might be better to just have notifications only and only upload the addresses to the watching script.
As for ready made tools, I don't believe there is anything like what you described, besides importprivkey/watch only with bitcoind. (Which seems like your best bet...)

I might also add that:
1. Copay by default automatically creates a 1 of 1 private wallet. (it starts with a 3... but it's basically a 1 address.
2. You could mention multisig during the presentation and lead-in to "by the way you can make a new wallet on Copay and JOIN A WALLET WITH THE GUY NEXT TO YOU!"
Then maybe have one of the pairs can come up and you can send them bitcoin and have them show the multisig process of transaction approval.
Or maybe join their multisig with your computer with the presentation (everyone can see the approval screen on your computer then)
Copay supports: Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android, Windows Phone. Multisig wallets can be created amongst any combination of these platforms.

This place accepts BTC and you can buy some cool PC games.
1. Once you get enough money in ChangeTip to buy a game, don't try and buy it using ChangeTip. First, withdraw money from ChangeTip to a normal bitcoin wallet.
2. For iPhone I recommend "breadwallet" and for Android I recommend "Mycelium" (not the gray one, the colored one) for Windows Phone I recommend "Copay"
3. Log into Changetip on your phone's browser and click withdraw. Then paste your address from your phone's wallet into the withdrawal page on ChangeTip.
4. Once you have the bitcoins in your wallet, then you can use them to buy games / etc.
If you would like to tip other people in the sub, ChangeTip is the way to go, but don't try to use them to pay for things online, as their withdrawal system is made under the assumption you are withdrawing to your own addresses, and sometimes it takes a while for them to process a withdrawal request.

Google. It's that simple.
Now, if it was a small miner who doesn't broadcast their name for everyone to see, and is only known by their IP address, then you're screwed.
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:48:31
Use Electrum.
You could, for instance, import the address to Electrum (just the address, not the private key) connected online, figure out the balance, and then create an unsigned transaction and pop it on a USB thumbdrive. Then disable all networking hardware in BIOS and boot from Tails, import the private key into Electrum, then use that to sign the unsigned transaction, take the signed transaction and bring it back online, and broadcast it on your online Electrum.
It's a pain, but you keep your private key quasi-safe, assuming you don't have hardware backdoors all over your computer. (inb4 "we all do...")
Also, Electrum uses "RFC6979" which is a method of signing ECDSA signatures without increasing likelyhood of brute forcing the private key.
So the detriments you must consider:
1. Privacy. Anyone who can link the 20 eurocents to you can then assume you have whatever other balances you include afterward as well.
2. Public key exposed. If ECDSA breaks, one time only address users will still have SHA256 and RIPEMD160 protecting their keys. Spending even once will expose the public key. This is also tin foil hat territory.
3. Hardware backdoors. tin foil hat level paranoia, but possible.

Paste the following script:
    00e10b5e OP_CLTV OP_DROP &lt;PASTE_PUBKEY_HERE&gt; OP_CHECKSIG
into this site under "enter redeemscript":
Be sure to replace &lt;PASTE_PUBKEY_HERE&gt; with your pubkey in hex.
    00e10b5e OP_CLTV OP_DROP 0393d50245cc6b3ccffc4ed44bc75924b0f7ec8b35a4d48818a5738e8725d467f7 OP_CHECKSIG
Then click "Show P2SH Address" after making sure the setting in the upper right of the page is "Bitcoin Mainnet"
Any bitcoin sent to that address can be redeemed by a transaction where each input's nSequence is not 0xffffffff and the nLockTime is equal to or greater than the time given in the redeemscript. (This will mean that you can not broadcast to the network until after that point, as nodes will reject transactions whose nLockTime value is set to a point in time AFTER their current time on their local system clock.)
The ScriptSig to redeem it will be:
    &lt;SIGNATURE&gt; &lt;redeemscript&gt;
However, my tool does not require the redeemscript for the ScriptSig part, so:
    SIG_1
is all you need.
Be careful though. Who knows what will happen to Bitcoin before 2020.
Edit: btw, to get the time, flip the bytes of 00e10b5e to get 5e0be100. Then turn that hex into a number and multiply by 1000. (in javascript: parseInt("5e0be100",16)\*1000) then feed that into a Date() object: new Date(parseInt("5e0be100",16)\*1000)

If you have the xpub from all copayers, then here's all you need to do: (this can all be done with bitwasp or some other Bitcoin php library)
1. In the copay app, click "Generate new address" on the receive screen a bunch of times.
2. Take the xpubs of all copayers, and start generating pubkeys from `m/45'/2147483647/0/0` and increment the last 0 to 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. with every request you make on your sever.
3. Once you get the N amount of pubkeys needed, plug them into this set format: `5X 21 &lt;pubkey1&gt; 21 &lt;pubkey2&gt; 21 ... &lt;pubkeyN&gt; 5Yae` where you repeat 21 &lt;pubkey&gt; for the N amount you have. X in 5X should be the number of signatures required, and Y in 5Y should be the number of total pubkeys. You must sort the pubkeys in ascending order. ("02..." will come before "03..." etc.) then just HASH160 that whole thing (removing spaces of course, and not as ASCII representation of hex, but actual raw data) and you get your multisig address.
4. Since you are not using Bitcore-Wallet-Client, you must manually add addresses through copay or BWC occasionally in order to see your payments within Copay... If you know that .../35 has bitcoins on it, you'll be stuck tapping generate new 35 times on your app.
Again, I reiterate that this can all be done with current libraries if you really wanted to.

I personally like to write down the phrase on pieces of paper, store one at home, one hidden somewhere in my office at work and jumbled up a bit, and one on my person also jumbled up a bit.
That way if my house burns down or something, I have a backup ready assuming I remember how I jumbled it.
The jumbling part doesn't really help much with an adversary who stole it and is searching for all permutations of the 12 words with a valid checksum (which is 12! / 16 roughly, or 30 million valid combinations, which is a couple seconds for even a slow computer.) but at least it stops the casual dude who picks up the paper, realizes it's Bitcoin and tries to sweep it by typing it in his app long enough for you to realize it's gone and make a new wallet and move your funds.

What if you sent it to them from Coinbase?
Did they ask you if it was ok to send back to the address that sent them the coins? Or did they do it without your knowledge?
I would hate to have to put in a ticket with Circle or Coinbase to say "oops, Expedia refunded to your withdrawal address and not my deposit address."
If you told them to do it, then I can understand.
Reusing addresses and sending back to the address you "received it from" are two different problems.
Services should ask for refund addresses behind the scenes using BIP70 payment protocol, and recommend wallets that support it. If the wallet does not send a refund address in the requests response, then show the user a box to input a refund address.
If the user isn't using some stone age wallet, then all this will be done in the background.
btw, I used a lot of words like "sent from" in regards to addresses, but to be honest, there is no such thing as a from address. You only send TO addresses, not FROM.

"Oh what? Your transaction's first confirm is taking 300 blocks to happen with a $5 fee attached?... well, with OUR wallet, you can have INSTANT confirmations! Just trust us!"
I could definitely see someone higher up at GreenAddress painting this picture of Bitcoin's future and wanting it to go in that direction.
Remember, Bitcoin can fail as a standalone, but as long as we have layer 2 services like Greenaddress and Lightning Network and Sidechains propping it up, then who needs Bitcoin to be able to stand on its own? amirite gaiz?
I wish I was being sarcastic, but in all honesty this is the direction some devs want to take Bitcoin: The only people who can send a transaction directly on the blockchain are A. layer 2 service providers or B. Millionaires who can afford $5,000 per transaction fees.
I am agnostic on the issue, but tbh devs want to strong arm Joe Schmoe off the blockchain, then just come out and say "we should set MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE to 1 BTC, because then miners will have SUPER INCENTIVE TO DECENTRALIZE AMIRITE GAIZ!?"
Which would make just about as much sense as all of the non-scientific fear mongering some of these "devs" are doing. (whether it be light-hearted trolling or not)
Should we all go back to Elementary school and make up sheets with little defined sections that say "HYPOTHESIS" "EXPERIMENT" "RESULTS" "THEORY (CONCLUSION)" and have devs be forced to make dioramas? Oh, and make sure they use No. 2 pencils, and dot their "i"s and cross their "t"s?
I am all for LN, Sidechains, and Greenaddress, hats off to all of you, especially Greg Maxwell. However, this whole debate has pulled them into the small-blocker's side of "OMG THESE WILL SOLVE ALL OF BITCOINS PROBLEMS!" when they are just covering it up.
I would equate it to trying to fix bash shellshock bug by writing in string sanitizing into your javascript app. Layering on top of a problem is not a fix.

assuming they log ips and addresses when checking balances, yeah.
But other than that, (which is a caveat that a large amount of wallets have re: privacy) private keys are never stored on server, all non-meta data is encrypted with a shared key, etc. soooo they're one of the best wallets imo.
breadwallet is great, but when the network decides "hmm, fuck SPV" as node policy, there's only so much that breadwallet can do clientside, like blacklisting nodes that don't cooperate etc.

Extracting your private keys means nothing, as the only decentralized multi-sig platform in existence is Copay.
All other multi-sig companies have a co-signing model and it's only meant for a single user.
Even if you could export the private key, you wouldn't be able to import it into any wallet at all besides Copay.
Notice how your addresses start with a 3 and not a 1 like other wallets. Yeah, if you send the bitcoin to the 3 address, then you're going to have to sign it using multi-sig p2sh signing rules, and those are completely different than normal signing rules for the addresses starting with 1.
So unless you're a programmer with mad skills, the only way to restore a Copay backup is with Copay.
If it makes you feel any better, you can run your own Insight node, your own bitcore-wallet-service server and you can actually point your official Copay app to access your server and not Bitpay's.
Of course, if you're looking for an easy solution for extracting private keys, then you probably wouldn't be able to run a server. (Just guessing)
If you want wallet interoperability (export from one and import to another) then I suggest looking for a wallet that supports BIP32/39/44. If the wallet supports all three of those, then you can write down your key as a 12 word phrase, and plug that in to any wallet you want until the cows come home.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:58:47
There's also a "label backup" plugin which encrypts your labels with your master private key and uploads them to Electrum servers. With that then basically all you need is your phrase / old backup files can be re-synced and restored with all labels.

I think the idea would be that the govt. AND you would own the private key.
The idea being that when you would normally give out your SSN to someone like a bank or employer, in the new system you would just sign a challenge to prove you own the private key connected to the public key.
A dumb person could just as easily lose their social security card, which would require receiving a new one from the govt.
With privkeys, the government could generate you a new one and your old ssn would be invalid after a certain point etc.

I think the thought process is more like:
I don't need to send you an e-mail to make your e-mail address "real"
I guess it's either a consequence of a decentralized system, or we just haven't thought of an elegant enough solution.
I always like to think the latter, as the former tends to make people stop thinking about problems and get complacent.
However, this proposal is the best we got, so I hope it gets widely adopted.
The only thing I would recommend against is the whole "this is ACTUALLY a from address!" pitch.
If I lost my master key, then you would be sending to multiple addresses that I can no longer control.
One of the big reasons to eliminate the "from address" myth is to encourage confirmation of payment addresses as often as possible, and out of band whenever possible.

But I could literally create 1000000000 0 fee transactions sending 1 satoshi back and forth between two addresses (heck, even the same address) and as long as I solve it, that is totally valid (if there was no block limit)
Let's say it takes most miner's / nodes 0.00001 second to check a signature... ok, make a 26 GB block with 100000000 0 fee transactions chaining with each other... every node will have to check every signature on that... which will take over 15 minutes.
While they're checking blocks (they must check a block before they can know whether or not they can mine on top of it) the bad miner has an advantage now, as the competitors are busy checking his block. He can now make another busy block...
This will kill Bitcoin price, so no serious miner would do this, but it's a LOT more sustainable than a 51% attack, heck... someone could amass 5% of the network and have a 1/20 chance of hitting the network, just multiply the size of their busy block by 20 and bam! yayyy!!

To be honest: he DID use the app in a non-supported way.
The app told him to make a backup by pressing a backup button =&gt; he assumed backing up his xprv was sufficient.
The app then locked his funds when he assumed that a transaction proposal could be rescinded by the proposer at any time. When in actuality the proposer can only reject txps that have had no replies.

I think everyone is ignoring the most dangerous part of the 1 MB stranglehold.
I don't give 2 craps if fees go up to 10 cents or 20 cents. If they do, I might switch to Bitshares and their (currently) huge fees, but that's not the point of this post.
If we assume the average transaction is about 200 bytes (It's actually larger, which makes it worse, but just to give the benefit of a doubt) then 1MB can only support 5000 transactions per every 600 seconds on average.
Now, what will happen if we get more than that?


No, not quite as simple.
The recent "stress tests" only cleared themselves up after a few hours because they LET UP EVENTUALLY.
If natural transaction demand was consistently over 5000 transactions per 600 seconds for good, then mempool would fill until bitcoind instances start crashing due to memory being filled, and others will slow down block verification due to swap disk usage.
Surely some people will stand up and say "ok how about every block we delete the lowest priority transactions in each of our mempools until a certain limit is reached" or "how about we automatically force people to use swap disk space to handle the outrageous memory leakage from each individual's mempool" or a billion other equally contentious "solutions" (a la Luke-jr's infamous "blacklist by default" patch for Gentoo)
This would then become a Bitcoin where 0 confirmations does not guarantee you get into a block ever, and "you'll confirm eventually" becomes a lie.
In such a world, I would PRAY that the otherwise unnecessary replace by fee patch is widely adopted, otherwise you are out of luck.
Everything will take anywhere from 10 to 60 minutes to get first confirmation. 0 confirmation transactions that didn't make the cut will be deleted from mempool in droves every time a new block is found.
Sure, this might be the awesome solution (to what problem, I don't know) that some people would like to see. A bitcoin where 0 confirmations has absolute 0 reliability (rather than the non-zero non-100% reliability it used to have)
I am currently working on a systematic overload situation in my day job, and if my solution was "hey, why not let economic forces handle my job, I'm sure if you force part time workers to work overtime until all the work gets done some will quit, but others will see the amazing economic opportunity in our inefficient system and love to come work with us I'm sure." I can guarantee you I'd be fired the next day.
If the consensus is "Bitcoin doesn't need to scale" then wow @ IPv4 all over again.

Write a note above your old phrase saying "I used this up til this date" and file it away with your other important documents.
Or if you use the same phrase in both Mycelium and breadwallet, just write a note above your phrase on the paper you wrote it on, "Have both breadwallet (BIP32 path) and Mycelium (BIP 44 path) with this phrase"
I mean... I understand "usability should be perfect right now because I said so" is the plight of all redditors, but you signed up to "be your own bank" and you can't write a note above your phrase?
Isn't the idea of Bitcoin decentralization of power?
By concentrating ALL your security onto ONE phrase... that is by definition centralization of power. And by inputting it into every device you own under the sun, you are spreading out your attack surface, meaning you're just painting more bullseyes on your back every time you spread your phrase to a new device.

Stealth protects your transactions from being viewed by a third party who has never sent you coins before.
Also, it eliminates address reuse, as even if the same person wants to send you coins at a later date, if you give them an HD address, they'll likely send the second transaction to that address too.
With stealth addresses, every time you send to the address it generates a mew bitcoin address on the sender's client.

Not when the first input is an imported address.
If the first input is an imported address, the change will go to that address.
However, imported address's change address selection has been wonky, and there are some bug reports of change addresses being selected when they wanted the imported address to be used for change etc.
There has never been any money losing bugs regarding change, it will always go somewhere in your wallet, just always be mindful of whether it went back to your imported address or whether it went to an address in the "change" section, and you'll be fine.

oh ok I get it now.
You get 100% of the reward from 1 in 101 blocks.
So 10 second blocktime x 101 blocks means you get 100% the reward of ~50 BTS every ~17 minutes.
This means you get about 2652 block rewards each month.
You said about ~50 BTS per block is the total reward... at about 2 cents USD per BTS, that's around 1 USD per block.
It's a little more extreme than shares in a startup... as your entire salary is basically given to you in "shares" of that company... risky. I like it.

By the time a person could set up the scripts and tools necessary to perform the hack, they would have spent enough time of their lives to make it cost prohibitive. (Even if assuming no cost of tools etc.)

Compressed addresses use a 33 byte public key, uncompressed addresses use a 65 byte public key.
Because the public key is not contained in the address, just the hash of it, the length of the Address does not change.
However, your transactions will be 32 bytes smaller for every input you use. This adds up, especially for people using faucets and the like.

The blockchain is not a good medium for secret voting.
It's completely public, and you can prove, using a signature from your private key, that you voted a certain way... Aaaaaaand then we have vote purchasing on a national scale (instead of just congress and senate)
People say "accountability!!!!" and never doubt the fact that congress and senate vote with their names attached, because "I must be able to hold them accountable!!!1"
No. Just, no. If the votes aren't secret, then people can prove how they voted, and then receive money for it.
Ring signatures seem like they would be promising for voting schemes, but it's not fully there yet.
Also, going to a physical place is crucial, as you could just as easily show the vote buyer your cell phone screen while you vote in order to prove your vote and receive money... So the voting booth won't go away, even if we could crypto the counting algorithms...

With HD wallets, you don't back up private keys, you backup one seed that backs up all private keys for all eternity.
The problem is that any individual private key derived from your seed when combined with your master public key can reveal the master private key (aka ALL YOUR PRIVATE KEYS)

I use BTC on a daily basis, and I usually buy back whatever I use, so I'm basically just using it as a method of payment and nothing else.
I completely understand the use case for bitcoin.
To the anti-CC people: Shut up, CC have their uses. Choice is not a bad thing, and CC companies are not "feeling threatened" unless they are really dumb companies.
To the anti-bitcoin people: Shut up, bitcoin has its uses. Choice is not a bad thing, and there is no reason that removing the choice of bitcoin would benefit anyone.
Bottom line, when consumers have a choice, everyone wins.
Bitcoin acceptance is always a plus for everyone (including those who don't use bitcoin) because it offers choice.
Credit Cards also offer a choice to people who wish to get miles on their airliner card or have extended warranties or traveler's insurance etc.
Bitcoin allows you to do many other things, like shop online without a bank account, and without the outrageous fees they charge for every purchase and every month you don't make a purchase with prepaid debit cards.
Bitcoin also allows you to hire freelancers across the globe via the internet without having to worry about outrageous paypal fees or currency conversion gouging.
Everyone tries to nitpick each other with tiny things that usually only apply to specific use cases or specific countries, and this goes for both sides.

I believe they're referring to the contact-replacement / vanitygen attack vector.
if you are certain your address for Circle will always be 1abcd...xyz, you're more likely to save it in some contacts list and forget about it. Hacker hacks into your computer and changes your contact to his address. You don't check, and hacker gets your bitcoins.
Using the same address all the time will eventually give it to someone on the internet... an attacker could then use vanitygen to brute force and generate an address that matched 1abc... and maybe the last few letters don't match your address... but as long as he gets the first 4-5 letters right... you could just glance, think it's yours, and send bitcoins to the attacker.
These are both attack vectors that most people think "it'll never happen to me. I'm smart. I'd notice something like that." so I'm sure they are grossly under-reported due to pride. However, even though they should be under-reported, they happen quite often.

Ok, let me simplify.
If there's 9 red jelly beans and 1 blue jelly bean in a jar, and you draw one jelly bean, note its color, then place that jelly bean back in the jar, picking 10 times results in a 1 (100%) probability of picking the blue jelly bean.
My point is, "having a 100% probability" is not the same as "will definitely happen."
I can pick jelly beans 200 times and never pick the blue one, and my 200th try would have a probability of 20 (2000%). But that doesn't mean anything to my results, except that "I'm super unlucky, to the point of doubting whether the game is rigged."

Calculate a point on the elliptic curve = to (z/s)*G + (r/s)*Q
1. Q = the public key of the person who signed it
2. G = the generator point of the ECDSA curve
3. s = the s value included in the signature
4. r = the r value included in the signature
5. z = the double-SHA256 of the transaction message.
Then check to see if the x value of that point is = to the r value in the signature. If it is, the signature is valid.
Edit: Here's an explanation of the signature algorithm as well.
You need to calculate two values for a signature, they are called "r" and "s".
r is calculated by calculating a point on the curve that is made by k * G, where k is a random number between 0 and the order of the curve, and r is the x value of the calculated point.
s is calculated by the equation = (z+rq)/k where k is the same random number used to calculate r, r is the x value of the point created by multiplying k to the generator point, q is the private key using to sign, and z is the double SHA256 hash of the transaction message.
The r and s values are all that is needed to prove that you have the private key without revealing the private key.

Hey, you never said a "good"/"understandable" diagram.
Basically, the block header is what is sent out to the miners by the pool operators, and the miners just hash the block header in order to get the block hash. The block header contains the merkle root of all the transactions in the block, the hash of the previous block, and other pertinent data.
The block itself is just a list of transactions, and no other information, at all.
I don't think I understand your question? "How are transactions attached to a block?" = "They ARE the block." "if only the Merkle root is there?" = This refers to the block HEADER.

Now you can use Bitcoin and Litecoin.
In the future, they want to develop a ubiquitous API that can connect to a full node of any altcoin and query the appropriate blockchain. This includes assets on counterparty and colored coins.
Here's the thread they are discussing it on.
It'll happen sooner than you think.
Only downside is that currently they use the same path for each coin, so if you use the first address on your Bitcoin and the first address on Litecoin. It's the exact same hash160 and same pubkey... So anyone will know the two are linked.

I hope my child gets colds and gets sick a lot when he's young.
Why? Because it is scientifically proven that people who caught a lot of colds when young have stronger immune systems when they get older.
Same thing with Bitcoin. a 51% attack will force us to evolve into something that CAN'T be 51% attacked. Being sheltered from it all artificially will only delay the 51% attack until the stakes are so high that some really gnasty people will do it, and they won't be so nice.

1. Store credit only. Anything else would be a headache right now. Anyone who says otherwise hasn't thought it through.
2. Sorry, idk.
3. Perhaps give any part-time employees a little bitcoin and tell them to "test it out" at your store as a customer. That way, your employees will know the customer side of your bitcoin POS experience and (hopefully) will pick up on the do's and don'ts.

So I'm guessing you consider yourself not a part of this subreddit?
Isn't that just grouping people to suit your needs?
Your logic:
If you're a blind hodler that parrots to the moon and actually good news they you're a r/bitcoin member, if not, you don't count.
My logic:
Anyone who visits here is a member, and the upvotes show a majority sentiment. Obviously people who like something will search it out to talk about the thing they like, but people who don't know of Bitcoin's existence or ignore it for being stupid wouldn't come here to begin with.
My conclusion:
For bitcoin or against bitcoin, you are a member of this subreddit, and if you have a valid point that can convince blind hopefuls to come down to earth, go ahead and make it.
But if all you are going to do is complain about optimism that you view is unfounded, than you are no better than they are imo.
I am an optimist with Bitcoin, but feel free to make a valid point and turn me into a pessimist.

Yes, but in order to do that we need to be hit with something huge.
If we try to change Bitcoin fundamentally when nothing is going down, NONE and I mean NONE of the miners will follow, and we will be stuck with the POW we have now.
We do not decide what goes into the miners' machines, the miners do. If they don't want to upgrade, they won't.
The only way an honest miner would give up profit in order to upgrade to a new version that lower's their profit will be if staying with the old version will lead to them mining a worthless thing (aka, if they don't switch Bitcoin dies... THEN they'll switch to salvage some profits)
"The smart people" are people like myself and others who are constantly writing code for the core, reviewing code, and reviewing other pull requests. Trust me, this is not something that we are "ignoring"... there are solutions in the queue, but like I said. Miners will not like our solutions, I guarantee it. They will only like it if the ultimatum is upgrade or Bitcoin dies. That's why it's a last resort.
A lot of these security related code changes are kept off github so as not to tip off a potential attacker, and will be implemented when the attack happens.
However, I enjoy watching the discussion, so if you have any solutions you can jot down, I'd love to hear them in a post.

You're mixing up bits and bytes all over that paragraph.
1. The reason for compression is to lower the size of the public key from 65 bytes (0x04 + x:32 + y:32) to 33 bytes (0x02 OR y AND 0x03 + x:32) which is a decrease of 32 bytes. (256 bits) This decreases the size of each input ScriptSig by 32 bytes, which adds up.
2. The compression byte added to WIF to change '5' to 'K' or 'L' is only used in the WIF to denote compression (so you can tell which one you're looking at by looking at the first letter) and has nothing to do with decreasing any data, just making it look different, and recognizable.
(Note: the OR and AND I am speaking of is bitwise operands)

One Name is something similar to firstbits. The main dev is pretty active and wants to eventually use the "Dual-key Stealth Address" protocol to allow for each transaction to generate a separate random Bitcoin address but all of them to be linked to the same onename.
It seems cool, and might be something you want to look up if you're into the whole "human-readable send-to address" thing.
Eventually, if something like onename can get on a blockchain like Namecoin, then we can create a trustless version of onename, and that would be awesome.
However, I do think that onename as it is used currently is still slightly dangerous... as you are relying on the DNS servers to serve you the correct page etc.

I disagree. I think Ethereum will crash gloriously in the first few months... then the community will take over once the company goes bankrupt... then people will wander around for a while not knowing what to use it for... then in a few years it might be useful and worth something.
During that interim, Bitcoin will continue to grow with services on layers on top of the blockchain. (a la colored coins, counterparty etc.)
Ethereum might be useful farther down the line, once Bitcoin becomes mainstream.
Also, one thing to keep in mind:
Bitcoin was made to solve a problem. Ethereum was made to add features that sound useful, repackage, and then... change the world somehow?
I would be more into Ethereum if the project had a clear goal set out. Bitcoin = A trustless peer to peer currency to solve the banking crisis by disruption.
What is the problem that Ethereum is solving? Can you answer anything besides "not having turing complete blockchain!" because that is not a problem, that's a feature.
Anyone who's worked for a company as a programmer learns this in planning 101. Features for the sake of features tend to fail horribly.

51% attack is just called that because it's supposed to mean "You are faster than the rest of the network at hashing."
Which if you had 51% of the hashing power, you would be 2% faster than the rest of the network combined. (because you own 51% and the rest owns 49%)
If it was a 50-50 thing, you'd be about the same speed.
Which is why it's referred to 51%... However, realistically, since mining is a luck game anyways, and as you know with luck, you won't always get 1 heads and 1 tails if you flip a coin 2 times... there is a probability that someone with 60% of the network could fail at double spending. There's a probability that someone with 99% of the network could fail at double spending....
It's all just probability........ of course, if someone had 99% of the network... we're screwed... 51% exactly? Meh, we have a close to 50-50 chance of being screwed for a few minutes until a fix roles out to thwart the miner.
If it was selfish mining, then run the priority sum protocol out onto the blockchain.
If it was chance mining, then run stricter rules on transaction inclusion.
Problem will at least be held at bay until we figure out how to fix it long term.
However, as of now, no one has yet to attempt a 51% attack. (Note: just because some entity GAINS 51% the network, does not necessarily mean they will attack the network... In fact, conspiracy theories about with GHashi.io and they're spy miners in other pools that send winning blocks to GHash.io etc.... whatever...)
Right now, the miners stand to gain nothing from Bitcoin losing all its value... so no one will attempt an attack on the system from the inside.

Sure why not.
Do you want to run it through a node command or in a browser? (the latter is slower)
What OS do you use?
Edit: Please note that node.js and Python etc. will take you a while to generate 1 million addresses. I just tried it and it was going to take around 6 hours to generate a million. (1000 every 21 seconds) Also the txt file it would generate would be a 36 MB text file... so it would be sluggish to open.
I could make it so you could set the starting index and ending index. so like 1 - 10000, then a few days later use the script again with 10001 - 20000 and keep doing that periodically etc. I could also make it so the text files would be created in groups of 10000 or so... etc.

How does it derive this information from the blockchain?
The responder doesn't answer that question.
The idea of Stealth Addresses sounds good on paper, but addresses that are generated in this method must be independantly backed up separately from the seed, and thus are not a part of the BIP32 seed.
If someone can demonstrate that stealth generated addresses are also able to be restored from seed solely from the information on the blockchain, then I'll trust it enough to use it myself.

The coins are online. The private keys are basically your password.
It's just basically that no one will remember the private key, as it's way too long.
So holding private keys on an online computer is like storing a file on your desktop called "onlinebankpasswords.txt" where you have your online bank password encrypted with another, even weaker password.
Another way to keep funds offline is mnemonic phrases. Electrum etc. is a great way to keep bitcoins offline. Just don't ever export the individual private keys.

Hi there, welcome! Well, one thing you could do is...


... ohhhhhh kaaaaaayyyy...
Well, currently, there is no cookie cutter website that would do all that work for you for free.
The closest thing would be Bitpay or Coinbase or Gocoin... But they need your personal info because they are afraid of regulators at FinCEN arresting them like Charlie Shrem.
2 things I would suggest you do:
1. Try contacting that shoplocket service and ask them "to implement the option to accept Bitcoin payments."
2. Try going on and placing a bounty on someone who can make you a clean and simple site for accepting Bitcoin.
If you hire someone to do it, try to be more specific. For instance, do you want your site to be able to know if the payment has been received? How would you like to be notified? How should you handle it if the user doesn't pay within the allotted time? etc etc...
If you are just trying to say "come on guys we need this." Then you need to realize that the Bitcoin community is still very small, and most projects are made by guys in their parents homes, still in High School or sitting in their college dorm.
A few big name players have procured big VC bucks, but a large majority of projects are very ground roots.
One other way to do it, would be if you know any developer types that are into new tech, and pull a Steve Jobs on them. (aka pitch them an idea that sounds cool and they'll love to do just for the fun of it, and then take half the profit)

In the end, I think the likelihood of a 51% attack from GHash is next to 0 due to incentive alignment. But to be honest, we should all be mining on p2pool or some other method. Primarily because what's to stop a government from sending swat teams to GHash, BTC Guild, slosh, and every other pool operators place of operation and using force to control an instant 80-90% of the network to effectively shut us down.
I think arguing about 51% attacks is less effective than arguing about "pools are bad, even with each only having 5%, because it puts a traceable address on a large portion of the mining power to extort."

Have N people generate their own public / private keys.
Then EC point add everyone's pubkey points.
The private key of that point is the sum of everyone's private key modded by the order of the curve.
However, this is insecure, as it creates the situation of "whoever reveals their private key to the other N-1 people LAST could potentially walk away with all the funds."
To prevent this, multi-sig exists.

If bitcoin saw mass adoption, your use case would be one that they would probably account for.
I think if you used NFC / bluetooth to communicate with the register to automatically receive the current price / current balance of your wallet, then made the transaction, signed it, and sent it to the merchant for them to broadcast it would be possible...
However, this would leak so much private info to the merchant... it's crazy. (like exactly how much money is in your wallet etc.)
But to be honest, I think it would be solved best with hardware solutions tied to centralized custodians. ie. using a card with an ic chip in it that tells the merchant which coinbase account to withdraw from etc.
To solve this with decentralized client side solutions would be difficult to implement store-side and user-side...

That's what I meant by "if the words ARE supported." I mean that if I generated a mnemonic using the wordlist xyz.txt then I input that mnemonic into another program that ALSO has xyz.txt as one of its wordlists, then it will know when I type in the mnemonic: "Oh ok, all these words exist in xyz.txt, so let's decode the mnemonic back to it's entropy and check the checksum."


That's what I'm saying. IF you don't do PBKDF2, and ONLY encode your child key data (in place of the entropy) using the encoding method of BIP39, then reverse the encoding method to decode the data back into the original data (the child key) you COULD do it. But that would be non-standard.


That would make the wallet non-standard for BIP39, and you would gain 0 benefit from it, so they would probably just say no. But then again, I don't understand what you're saying exactly? You want them to place the ASCII byte data directly into the BIP32 HMAC-SHA512? is that what you're saying?

To give you stats from my node, I can verify a 1 signature transaction in about 0.065 milliseconds on my i5 2550k OC @ 4.3GHz.
Number of cores really doesn't matter, as there's no parallel operations in openssl point multiplication... So even if you had a crappy CPU... prolly wouldn't take any longer than 0.4 milliseconds per signature verification.
multiply 0.0004 seconds up to match 10 minutes (600 seconds), and you get:

DNS is a huge weakness. I could send you to a copy site where everything is displayed directly from Namechain, but the Bitcoin Address is shown as one of mine (the attacker). Of course, someone who wants to double check could verify the pgp sigs or check namechain... but most people wouldn't go through that check.
Forgive me if there is an open source wallet client that can perform lookups and sends to onename by directly accessing Namechain. I am not aware of one that does.

1. (1) is basically saying that if you are taking VC from customers in order to send to someone else (a la Coinbase) OR your business itself is transmitting your own funds to someone else (supposedly in NY) you are a VC business.
2. Securing, you are not. The user's password is securing, and what you are "storing" is NOT VC, but keys. You are not "holding" funds for anyone, nor do you control it.
I would say it is safe to assume anyone with even a basic understanding of Cryptocurrency would not hold your service as a VC Business under that definition.
However, I agree that the wording needs to be more clear.

It feels like the dev team is getting a lot of heat for something they have NO control over.
I mean, if you want to blame Satoshi for making the POW algorithm as he did, that would be a genuine criticism, but some people just sit and like to shit all over the dev team, which besides Gavin and maybe a couple others, everyone is VOLUNTEERING their time... I wouldn't be surprised if all the devs but Gavin left one day because of all the uninformed people who just need to shit on someone because they can't solve a problem.

tl;dr for anyone who didn't bother:
Instead of doing what BIP0039 states and PBKDF2-ing the phrase itself, regardless of the language of the wordlist, this BIP proposal states that all language lists should be converted to English BEFORE running through PBKDF2.
ie. If my first word in my Japanese phrase is word No.5 then the wallet would find the index of the given word (5) and then find the corresponding word on the English wordlist. Repeat for all words on the wordlist, then use as if English phrase.
Two major problems I see with this:
1. How would you tell, just from the phrase itself, which BIP the phrase was generated under? If I generated a Japanese phrase under your BIP, which gives me a wallet from the English transposition's hash, and then plug it into a BIP0039 wallet... the BIP0039 client will not be able to tell me what's wrong... Assuming "empty balance must mean they're following BIPxxx" is not logical... so the user will be even more confused than currently. (People trying Electrum seeds in Mycelium, etc... our mnemonic "standards" are confusing as is.)
2. How would you be able to detect the wordlist indexes if there are two wordlists from the same language with some overlapping words? BIP0039 allows for this, and it is not entirely unreasonable. (Someone might come up with an English wordlist that doesn't have "suicide" in it for example... or any other words they don't like.)

I understand what you're saying, but you forget the fact that you are talking about dollars, not decimal points of dollars (which we call cents)
You would not call $0.05 "zero point zero five dollars" you would call it "five cents" or "a nickel"
In the same vein, is saying "if we keep using the counting noun to refer to it in general, people will look at it like dollars, and as they don't know about "milli-bitcoins" and "bits" and whatever other units we give it, they will assume that they must buy at least a full bitcoin."
The idea being that "Would you like to buy some bitcoins?" sounds like I need to buy at least one, but "would you like to buy bitcoin?" does not sound like anything. (Though someone who might have heard the former might carry the unit bias they still hold even if hearing the latter) In short, the former spreads unit bias and the latter does not spread anything nor clear anything up, but is neutral.
Also, seeing as we don't have the equivalent of "cents" in bitcoin, (or at least not a unit that a non-bitcoin person would know) people will always think of it as a "whole" thing to buy.

In all seriousness. This x 1000.
If you just do a search for Mt Gox on this subreddit and read some of the more recent posts.
Coinbase is currently stable, but as long as you are trusting in them, there is no guarantee they won't be robbed/hacked/whatever, and bitcoins, unlike bank money, can NOT be charged-back. So your coins would be gone forever.
However, in order to store Bitcoins securely on your own, this requires a LOT of research.
(Ex. How to securely make a paper wallet without someone hacking into your printer spool to steal your private keys, How to set up an offline wallet in a way that the wallet never touches the internet, etc.)
So right now, I would buy as much bitcoin as you would be comfortable "lending" an acquaintence that your trusted friend says is a "trustworthy guy." and leave it in Coinbase for now.
On Coinbase, enable Two Factor Authenication, and do your best to make sure that you only access it on a computer that you scan regularly for viruses using malware bytes or another reputable anti-virus software.
The biggest problem with bitcoin, sadly, is that the minimum required security for the system is about as safe as an e-mail account. It's up to the user (or in the case of services like coinbase, the website) to take steps to make it secure.

I whipped this up in about a minute or two, minus the time it took to wait for my 0.0001 BTC input to confirm.

@_date: 2014-08-14 16:57:16
You can configure it.
Right now most transactions are signed WITH the outputs in the signed data, so the 2nd person signing could not change the sendee without the first person signing re-signing it.
However, there is a setting to make it so you sign the tx WITHOUT the outputs, so the 2nd or 3rd person (or anyone really... which is why it's dangerous) could change the output data after you signed and still be valid.
Edit: Interesting fact: copay had a bug where it didn't check for this setting. and people could manually change the type of the tx and send it out to the other users... then change the output and broadcast it... it's fixed now... but YIKES!

@_date: 2014-09-13 10:30:28
1. At first, a wallet is just a random number on your phone, usually protected (aka encrypted) with a password.
2. Then, when someone sends you some bits (0.000001 bitcoin) to your wallet, the wallet is actually asking a server that holds the blockchain: "Hey, do you have any transactions sending to these addresses? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5..." (Also, depending on the wallet, some will ask for addresses you don't even own, just to make it so the server's admin couldn't associate which addresses are owned by which IP, this is called "bloom filtering")
3. The server replies saying: "Oh yeah, I saw this transaction, txid: ef325cba... value: 0.002 BTC to address: 1..."
4. The wallet then shows your balance as 0.002 BTC. (please note that while your "balance" is shown, it is just adding up all received transactions' totals, there is a difference, I will explain later)
Now you've received about 0.01 BTC in 3 transactions, 1 sending you 0.002, one sending you 0.005 and one sending you 0.003.
5. You try to send 0.004 BTC to someone, so your wallet looks through the received transactions, and uses whatever methods / priorities it was programmed with to select a number of received transactions that will cover the 0.004 amount to send. Most wallets would just select the 0.005 transaction you received.
6. You add together the received transactions you selected, and make sure they are greater than the amount you want to send. Since I picked the 0.005 one, that is greater than 0.004, so we're good.
7. Now you need to split that received 0.005 into two pieces. One going to the person you're sending to, and one going back to yourself. (think of it like spending a 5 dollar bill and getting a 1 dollar bill back, except in bitcoin, the dollar bill can be of any value. Every time you receive bitcoin, you receive a "bill" of that value.)
8. So you split it into 0.004 to Bob, and 0.001 to yourself......... but wait, the wallet software notices this transaction does not meet the requirements for a free transaction. (more on that later)
9. The wallet adds on a 0.0001 BTC fee to the transaction so miners will mine it. Since it would make no sense to add another bill to the transaction, the wallet software lowers your "change" output from 0.001 to 0.0009. The missing 0.0001 is the "miner's fee"
10. Once this transaction is formed in your wallet, you input your password, the wallet decrypts (unlocks) your bitcoin address's "private key" and uses it to generate a digital signature for the transaction. This digital signature ensures that only the owner of the bitcoin address could have created this transaction.
11. The signed transaction is sent to the network. Then, next time the wallet software asks the network for the transactions. It will see the transaction you just sent, mark the 0.005 as spent, and subtract that, then see the new 0.0009 you just sent back to yourself and add that, then your balance shown in the app will reflect those two changes.
Note: Free transactions are calculated by a confusing formula... but to make it simple. "as long as all outputs (bills you send) are over 0.01 BTC and you are spending a transaction that is at least one bitcoin-day old (1 bitcoin that hasn't moved for 144 blocks, or approximately one day) you can send it for free." So this means if you have 0.5 BTC that has been sitting for 2 days, that's ok too... 0.1 BTC would be ten days and so on. Because of this, most bitcoin transactions have fees. At current price, usually this amounts to $0.05 or $0.005 per transaction, depending on the wallet.
If you have any questions, let me know.
Edit: clarification of balance discovery after send.

To clarify: The BIP39 phrase is run through pbkdf2, which is a key derivation function that they use with SHA512 as a basis to generating keys.
The function takes two things, the data to be hashed, and a "salt" which is used to modify the data.
BIP39 concatenates the word "mnemonic" with the "passphrase" that you input. so if your passphrase is "bob" the salt will be "mnemonicbob"
The seed is not touched and is hashed as is.
The salt changes the hmac updates for each iteration.
So tl;dr yeah, it's kinda like just sticking it on the end... but not really, as it is being stuck on the end of the salt and not the seed.

I don't think you're up to date on "replace by fee"
The current behavior of nodes is "if we see a new transaction that uses the same output as another transaction we've already seen, (even if it's unconfirmed) we will ignore it and will not relay the transaction.
With replace-by-fee:
If a transaction using the same output as a previous unconfirmed transaction arrives, look at the fee. if the second transaction's fee is larger than the one we saw first, then throw away the FIRST ONE and keep the SECOND ONE.
The idea behind it is to give people who "accidentally" send 0 fee transactions an easy streamlined way to "redo" their transactions with a higher fee.
I HIGHLY doubt it will get into the reference client... but you never know.
Last i heard, Eligius does it. and they have a handy push form to push transactions directly to them.

One of those things that looks ridiculous on paper, but if it works in practice, who cares.
My assessment: If it works, kudos. If it doesn't, fix it, then try again.
Reminder: The Bitcoin whitepaper was similarly a "that'll never work" idea on paper, then it worked. So I've decided to take a stance on these things of "great job on making a whitepaper, now stop arguing about theories and implement it already."
I get a feeling that a lot of places worry so much about the opinions of the community, that they forget that Satoshi didn't ask for permission to make Bitcoin.
If you think that it'll work, and revolutionize Bitcoin:
1. Implement it in Darkcoin and test it out.
2. Bonus points: Implement it on Bitcoin testnet and try it out. (maybe announce it on  or the mailing list and gather some testers.

Yup, and fiat is supposed to promote spending and stimulate the economy and generate true value out of thin air, and see how that turned out?
No one is going to switch to a one currency Bitcoin economy. The idea is that A. We could create a crypto that allows one organization to generate coins at will like the current fiat system if we wanted to, we just haven't yet. B. Having CHOICE in a free market is always good. If you want to save money for retirement you can do so with a deflationary currency, if you want to go on a spending spree you can do so with an inflationary currency, if you want to create value with your own work, heck, you can make your own currency and give it out to customers like reward points.

that would just drive the transaction fees up.
People would realize that there are a billion transactions with a fee of 0.0001 and people will add 0.0002 to get confirmed. Apps that set the fee automatically might have trouble, but anyone who can change their fees at will will notice and change accordingly.
This also assumes that no one is paying attention and no one does anything about it in the 80 some odd days you speak of. Mining pools will look for patterns and refuse transactions meeting those patterns etc. If it became too much of a problem people could look at the pertinent information, and if it warranted it, they could arrange a hard fork (which is much easier to arrange when people's money is on the line) to raise the block size limit or various other things.

I would assume you mean that if I don't open my breadwallet app on my phone for x amount of days, you would like my breadwallet app to send a signal to the blockchain saying my coins are dead and thus to invalidate my coins and generate them anew in the blockchain.
If this is what you are proposing... that is ludicrous. SO much potential for a third party to attack your wallet. And if you require the private key of the coins to sign off on their invalidation, then 99% of lost coins (due to losing private keys) would still be lost... Thus meaning there was no point to begin with.

because they control one of the keys (it's a 2 of 2 multisig), and the idea is that you don't have to trust them to give you the keys. nTimeLock is a provably redeemable transaction with all your coins on it. However it requires your mnemonic.
If they promised "we'll give you your keys if we ever disappear, we promise" then you're basically trusting them like you trusted Gox.
If GreenAddress.it offered a 2 of 3 option for more advanced users. (an account that would disable the "Instant Confirmation," as it would not be possible anymore) I would say Bitgo and Frozenbit (vaporware) would not have a leg to stand on.
I use GreenAddress for mobile payments, but I wouldn't use them as my main store........ primarily because I'm not the kind of guy that likes to wait... and setting the time to wait on the nTimeLock when i will have no clue what kind of situation I would be in is scary to me.

In the Bitcoin space, everyone and their mother likes to blast on their website "OMG WE WILL NOT PROCESS YOUR ORDER UNTIL 3 CONFIRMATIONS WHICH WILL TAKE UP TO 28934728937489237894 MINUTES AND CAUSE YOU TO WAIT BLABLABLABLABLABLA!"
When Paypal and Credit Cards do exactly the same thing, except with a 3-6 month wait.
The difference is that Paypal and Credit Cards just lie to you. They say "oh it's all good your payment went through INSTANTLY buddy"... then 2 weeks later you get a dispute to your account saying your account is frozen and they have taken the funds back from the merchant because they think you just bought cheesecake from an illegal cheesecake vendor.
Stores that take Bitcoin directly need to hide the 30 minute wait deep in some ToS just like Paypal hides the 3-6 month wait in theirs.
But no. Programmers like to explain processes that no one cares about. (I know, because I do it all the time)
No one is running to a warehouse, grabbing your Trezor and flinging it on a plane within 30 minutes - 1 hour... You'll notice that the time between when you "1-Click Pay" for Amazon items and the time you get e-mail notification that "Your order just shipped" is more than 30 minutes usually.
They are hiding their clearing wait under the assumption that everything goes well. And most times it does.
Bitpay, for instance, understands this. They even cover 100% of any double spends or any shennanigans that may end up in funds being misplaced (though they claim this never happens to them) and payments are instant through this promise, just like Paypal and Amazon payments are instant because of the respective company's promises.
Trezor should just say "Your payment has been received" Then "Your item has been shipped." in a separate e-mail once they get the confirmations they need.
If a problem comes up, then they should send an e-mail stating "There seems to be a problem with your payment. Please contact support."

You said miner's were irrelevant to hard forks.
I am saying that you can have a billion nodes, but if no one is mining, no blocks would ever be confirmed. And if some people were mining, they could be easily overtaken by the competing fork.
If only 4 GH/s move to the new fork, not only will the block confirmation take forever (unless the devs that made the new fork manually lowered the difficulty in the code), but someone with 10GH/s could just mine all the blocks with a single transaction with their reward and effectively shut down the other fork, making it impossible to use.
You said miners were irrelevant to a hard fork.
Miner's are what MAKE THE BLOCKCHAIN. There is no fork if no one is mining it.

Assuming demand stays constant, if supply increases, price must go down. If there's only 10 apples in the world and 200 people want it, you have people paying high prices to outbid each other and secure their apple. If the same 200 people want apples and there are 5,000 apples, the SELLERS of apples will under bid each other with low prices to GET RID OF the apples that won't sell (due to demand only being 200).
If supply increases, this is inflation, which devalues something (lowers its price) and does not "present a slight upwards pressure on prices"


If you are talking about growth of total supply, it increases at a rate that slows down exponentially over time. Meaning the growth in 2014 will be hundreds of times the growth in 2139.
This one I understand you could be just simplifying or guesstimating, but the first point is backwards, supply increasing lowers price.

I don't know how you handle your SHA512 database of order numbers, but if you ever lost it, you would lose access to your bitcoins.
If you're looking to use the SHA512 then the solution would be easy:
Replace the index key (normally made with half of a SHA512 hash of (pubkey || 4 byte index)) with order ID
You wouldn't be able to use handy dandy BIP32 libraries, and if you forgot all order numbers you'd lose the bitcoins forever.
But it is possible.

You may be right in regards to core devs that have been around since a couple years ago, but the problem is "there are not enough people to properly test, regress, and code check" considering the rapid growth of Bitcoin, what used to be the core devs just coding in their free time has now become a payment network that tons of companies, businesses, and people around the world have come to depend on.
Not to mention an ideological spin that tends to get the spotlight in the news lately.
Any devs interested tend to want to go into the lower risk projects in Bitcoin. Mess with the core and you might be responsible for billions of dollars. When that sets in, it's a kind of hurdle.
I think these funds would be best used to go out and headhunt a friggin awesome C++ programmer and contract him for a year or so. A new guy who could give a fresh perspective on the code base.
Also, your post assumes that the devs were all either buying or mining bitcoins back then. You need to realize that back then no one knew this would take off as much, and they viewed mining to be "way to hard to make any money" since way back when. (Primarily because they calculated at the current proce and not the possible future price)
You'd prolly be surprised at some core devs who might not even own any bitcoin. Who knows, some people could be in bitcoin as a part time hobby.

BIP38 = 16384 iterations of scrypt (memory intensive)    
BIP39 = 2048 iterations of HMAC-SHA512 (non-memory intensive)
The computing cost for one BIP38 "guess" is FAR more than 1 BIP39 "guess" and thus FAR more insecure as far as brute force prevention is concerned.
I think BIP39 and BIP38 have different use cases in mind. BIP39's password is merely added as a bonus to add plausible deniability and your BIP39 phrase is meant to be kept secret, whereas BIP38 was designed so that EVEN IF the BIP38 key was NOT secret... even a normal 8 digit password (like we're used to) would be safe enough for you to have time to make a new BIP38 wallet.

No arguments here.


Again, no arguments here.
My argument is the FUD part that insinuates that Bitcoin Core = unsafe, blockchain.info = unsafe, and *insert whatever thing you want to pump that just so happens to implement RFC6979 here* = safe is completely insane.
OpenSSL is not UNsafe, RFC6979 is just MORE safe.
Also, insinuating that BIP32 has 0 added security benefits is irresponsible.
If this was all rhetoric aimed towards devs, I would find no problem with it, because devs can understand the implications of these weaknesses (most of which are not new, and known)... but writing up a layman-geared article about it using words to incite FUD just puts a bad taste in everyone's mouth.
I understand that maybe it's not profit driven, and maybe it's just "well, if we get the masses who don't even know what an r value is to just agree with us, all the bitcoin businesses will appease the masses and do whatever we tell them." with good intentions at heart... but it's still pretty low IMO.

Every 2016 blocks, or about 2 weeks, bitcoin checks to see how long it took to mine 2016 blocks.
If it took exactly 2 weeks, down to the minute, the difficulty stays the same.
If the mining power doubled, and we had 5 minute confirmations and it only took 1 week to solve 2016 blocks, the difficulty would double, so that mining at the same speed will take 10 minutes per block.
If everyone left because of this, and it took 5 weeks to mine 2016 blocks, the difficulty would lower significantly, making it easier to mine.
So 2016 blocks is the span for retargetting.

They are a centralized service that takes bitcoins from you and in turn gives you a number next to your account name on their servers. The advantages are that you can tip people for 0 fees. (whereas bitcoin transactions on average cost $0.06 USD a pop (at current price)) Disadvantage is they could disappear with all your bitcoins. Solution: Don't put more than you are comfortable with losing on there. Small change to tip people for cool posts is more than enough.


Theoretically, by the time the blocks stop, transaction fees will have taken over as the main incentive for a while. (Remember, the last 4 years before all blocks stop will have a block reward of 1 satoshi. The 4 years before that 2 satoshis, etc. not a lot rly.) The idea is that as Bitcoin grows, the devs will increase the parameters to allow for more transactions, and as block reward becomes second to transaction fees, miners will be incentivised to include as many transactions as possible (This will be where we take over VISA in transaction volume... our artificially placed 7 transaction per second limit will be around for a while) to receive the transaction fees. People think this will raise the fees, but I think that the supply-demand slope will depend completely on the supply of transactions and the costs of miners (who knows what will happen to mining costs when block reward is second place...) So there are a lot of big unknowns, but it's not exactly a sudden catastrophe... if it becomes a problem, we will see it slowly creep up, and we will have time to deal with it. (or never find a solution and Bitcoin fails, who knows... or maybe it won't ever be a problem to begin with. Remember, this is a first in history.)


Last sell price on any exchange. Just like any other stock, commodity, or currency. If you don't understand economics, think of it this way. If 10 people want to buy 1 apple, but only one of them can buy it, Mr. A will offer $5, then Mr. B will offer $10 so on and so on until the highest bidder gets an apple. Then if 50 people show up wanting to sell their apples, they don't want to be stuck with their apples, so they will offer lower prices because they want to get rid of their apples. Basically, when more people want to buy than sell, the price goes up, the opposite, the price goes down. It usually comes out to an equilibrium. That, plus market manipulation (which NASDAQ and Bitcoin both have plenty of), decides the price.


It is governed by the rules in the code. These rules are decided by the hundreds of developers from around the world that contribute to the bitcoin project. Most of the rules are based off of discussions that are witnessed on forums such as reddit, bitcointalk, and irc. Bitcoin is, in its current state, still very experimental, so I would say we started with crypto anarchy and are slowly settling down. However, Bitcoin is merely a protocol. What people do with it is where anarchy / law come into play. Just like the internet.


On a protocol level, almost nothing. But the same can be said for the internet, etc. Most "dummy-proofing" is done with software (wallet software etc.) that sits on top of the main protocol. Unfortunately, we're still pretty new, so user friendliness is still on the lower end of the spectrum, but it's getting better every day.


Bitcoin is amazing. Forget about the money for a second, and just look at the technology... it boggles the mind... the things that are now made possible by the new concept of "the blockchain" is just astounding. Sno-caps, Ethereum, Maid-safe, Counterparty, Namecoin, etc. etc. all have amazing innovations that are waiting around the corner (google them, seriously) and it's all thanks to one guy, Satoshi Nakamoto.

I wouldn't say so much trolling as just pointing out that comparing bitcoins to Debit cards is wrong, bitcoins are more comparable to cash.
Losing cash on the street and getting it stolen leaves you out of luck, but with bitcoins, if you know what you're doing, you can encrypt the wallet then have a backup in a separate location.
By the time anyone even figures out what bitcoins are, let alone the password, you will have recovered the back up and sent the bitcoins to a new wallet.
Banks have their pluses. You don't have to ignore or deny Bitcoin's pluses for that to be true.

There is an optional "prefix" value which is currently not being used.
The way it works is the sender places a 4 byte nonce before the emphemeral key in the OP RETURN (the identifier OP talked about)
Right now they just place in a random nonce for no reason, but in the future. I could have a "one bit prefix" which would require the sender to brute force the nonce until the hash of the OP return script's first bit is identical to the first bit of the stealth address's prefix.
This can be done for as long as you want (up to 32 bits)
the trade off is that the longer your prefix is in bits, the more you elimiate other stealth transactions and the less private your transactions become (as your prefix value is public knowledge embedded in your stealth address.)
but if you think of the scaling as there being 100s of stealth transactions in each box, having a one bit prefix will lower that down to 50 you need to search, a 2 bit prefix will be 25 to search etc. if we just go by probability.
I also proposed putting in 0x80 (128) for the prefix length to denote that the sender should place a full 4 byte prefix as is in the nonce field. This could be a way of using "stealth" addresses as just a mere "public address that doesn't reuse addresses" without the stealth aspect. (as 4 bytes will differentiate enough to where you can just find the OP RETURNS with your 4 byte prefix as the nonce and you probably won't find any false positives)

2a is the address version byte, 00 is the stealth protocol version byte.
Seeing as no one uses your script except for you, it's irrelevant, but the idea is that if there was any backwards compatibility breaking features added to the stealth protocol in the future, that can be denoted with the 00 byte by upping it once per version. Yet the 2a will be a solid, unmoving stealth address mainnet version byte.
Changing the 00 to ff doesn't make sense. If you were to change anything it should be 2a. (just like bitcoins 00 for address changes to 80 for private key WIF) maybe add 80 to 2a? (so aa)
Also, the 01 and 0100 for are the m and n of an m-of-n p2sh multisig (which stealth supports). It's just that Dark Wallet only currently generates 1 of 1... aka normal p2kh addresses. that's why it's 01 and 01.
The 00 after the second 01 is known as the prefix length. That is also not yet implemented in Dark Wallet, but it is well documented in how it is used on their wiki.
Overall, your script has a very very very limited use... but at least it shows you understand the math behind the diffie-hellman key exchange as it pertains to ecdsa. Keep studying.
Also, fyi, importing a secure ecdsa library is infinitely better than re-writing the entire math out. (I notice you copy-pasted from blackboard-101... copy-pasting is also not the safest practice to have as a habit)
If you're serious about becoming a programmer, you've got a ways to go, but we all start somewhere.

Nope. He did not decide this, the Bitcoin network halving algorithm and 21 million limit was set in early 2010. Proposed by someone else, in fact.
Check Github around that time.
Also, if the majority of the miners decided to switch to a branch that removes the limit and triples their block reward, they could.
They won't, though, because their incentives are geared to make them desire scarcity. (I mean, why spend tons of money mining something if a guy with a pen can create them out of thin air?) Not to mention the mining incentive model, and thus PoW as it stands would collapse, utterly destroying the distributed consensus, if Bitcoin adopted an all-you-can-print system.
However, look at the hard fork of 2013. Perfect example of the miners' power to control the network. That is why the dev team has become so conservative with potential hard forking changes.
Satoshi is gone, and tbh his influence on the project is basically just the PoW consensus algorithm... Which will also probably be changed sometime in the near future.
I would much rather trust my monetary policy to math, which I can understand. You would rather trust it to the people who caused the 2008 shock, because I'd assume you can understand them.
However, Bitcoin could change to fit your monetary views if enough people like you got into mining or coding the protocol. Whereas my voice falls on deaf ears in the world of the global monetary system.

While the ideal situation would be a self-regulating commune system, unfortunately, a lot of countries feel like they HAVE TO regulate it, and won't stop until they do.
My question is not "HEY Let's regulate Bitcoin!"
My question is "Hey, my country and a lot of your countries are trying to regulate Bitcoin, and "no regulation" is NOT an option by their standards. How do we inform them on how to make a compromise between what they want and what we want?"
This is important, as there's not enough people who even know what Bitcoin is in some countries to "rally up and protest" to stop regulation.
I personally have connections with an organization in Japan that is receiving a lot of inquiries about how to regulate Bitcoin. Rather than my opinion, I wanted the consensus of a few more Bitcoiners.

To create a transaction you must know:
1. the txid of the referenced inputs (edit: you also need to know how much they're worth)
2. the index of the referenced inputs
3. the Bitcoin address of the place you wish to send.
4. the Bitcoin address you want to send the change to. (If change goes to the sending address, not needed)
To sign the transaction:
1. the private key of each address that was referenced in the used inputs of the transaction.
As long as you have this info, you can create a transaction, and sign it. Then the merchant could just copy + paste the raw hex of the transaction and push it to the bitcoin network. They can not alter your transaction in any meaningful way.
@_date: 2014-08-18 17:17:06
Nope. The change was input improperly.
"Setting a miner's fee" is actually just deciding "How much you want to lower your change so that the difference between inputs and outputs can be given to the miners.
Whatever script he used must have slipped a decimal point and said "change? oh yeah 0.28 BTC is fine!"
Miner's fee is the difference between inputs and outputs, 28 BTC - 0.28 BTC = a looooot of BTC gone.

However, I am not sure if any software supports a 16 member multisig.

Once you're comfortable, try seeing if you can make a 9 of 16 or 8 of 15 multisig wallet... (idk if it would be possible with copay...)

It's not a glitch in their software. It was a distributed attack using the txid malleability issue. (which sounds to me like, "A bunch of bots tried to pull the same stuff that happened with mtgox on us, it failed, but they took down our ability to properly calculate balances due to all the traffic they gave")
MtGox was an issue with software developed in their company not even recognizing malleability as an issue, which caused the problem.

Currently there is no program that contains this specification.
However, there are two aspects of BIP38 that would be difficult (but not impossible)
1. BIP38 requires hashing the address created by the private key and using the first x bytes of the hash as a check. (ie, if you try to decrypt with a wrong password, it will decrypt to an incorrect address and the hash won't match. This is how you tell whether the user has a correct password or not. This would mean that in order to BIP38 encrypt OR decrypt, you would need to know the multisig address, AND you would have to make sure that you knew which multisig address was attributed to, and you would need the pubkeys of the other members (aka the redeemscript) so that you could replace the proper key, create the P2SH address in order to check it against the hash of the original address. This would be VERY difficult to implement, and would be nearly impossible to make sure that everyone implemented it in the right way (as all the required data could not be contained in the BIP38 address)
2. The flagbyte contains extra bits which are `"reserved for a future specification that contemplates using multisig as a way to combine the factors such that parties in possession of the separate factors can independently sign a proposed transaction without requiring that any party possess both factors."` which shows that the authors foresaw using it for multi-sig... but as I explained in  it would be technically difficult.
Long story short. This is one of the reasons why BIP38 is still technically in "Draft" status. It is not 100% set in stone yet. (Though with so much support for its current state... I doubt they will ever change the normal address's private key encryption.)
For now, If you want to encrypt, I suggest independently encrypting, or writing your own script for encrypting / handling the private keys.
If you're not a dev, then... sorry... it's probably not going to happen for a while.

They could use mnemonics... but the problem is you would need the extended public keys of every other member in order to generate the redeemscripts.
If you could get those all into a giant mnemonic, it would be something like 24 words x extended public key + whatever number of words for your extended private key......... so yeah, the point of the mnemonic would be lost.
They COULD do what blockchain.info does and create a "wallet guid" (aka the identifier on blockchain.info) and store an encrypted copy of all the redeemscripts on a server that could be queried with a shared password (one that all members must know)... but the logistics of that would be insane, and I don't think the structure of Copay was made with that type of storage in mind. In addition to that they could monetize it by offering an escrow/backup service run by Bitpay, where they will join your wallet and sign your transactions for you in the case of loss / conflict on a deal.
In the end, Bitcoin is about personal responsibility, and it has little room for mistakes, unfortunately.
If you want mistake-proof user friendliness, (maybe) Circle, Coinbase, etc. would gladly manage your keys, "so you don't have tooooooo." (I forgot what movie that's from)
A lot of people give this type of sentiment flak... but seriously, the entire system of Bitcoin is based on not needing trust. And the only way to help users when they make mistakes is if they trust you with control over their funds in some way.
I personally think this is why Greenaddress.it is in a very good position to offer a nice medium between blockchain provable control but with SOME failsafes that Greenaddress can control for you. (using 2 of 2 multisig with their servers)

hmmmmm... it accepts arbitrary user chosen inputs for the  that's not very safe... they should encode some data with a checksum.
Example. I could type in my own
and it will create a wallet. I mean, no one with half a brain would do such a thing... but some people in the world have less than a half a brain...
1. take entropy generated by mouse/tap input, and convert into binary data.
2. double sha256 that binary data, and take the first 4 bytes from that hash and tag it on the end.
3. convert the binary entropy data + checksum into base 64 or base whatever to create the brainwallet.
That way when the browser checks the # input if the checksum doesn't match it just takes you to the new wallet generation screen.
You'll still be able to generate the address using brainwallet just as you can now, it just won't let you create your own crappy brainwallet.
Implementing this after-the-fact is hard, as people who will want to use it and have already created one, obviously don't have checksums... maybe tell everyone to import their private keys somewhere using  ... then switch over or something.

not only that, but the random value generated during signing was also victim to the bad randomness and this also leaked keys.
So even if you didn't generate the keys during the time when it was broken, even just sending a single transaction during that time was enough to crack your address.
Many people don't know about duplicate r values being a problem for addresses (though it did gain some notoriety lately)
However, there was a vulnerability that is the reason johoe gathered so many BTC, it is an extension of the r value vulnerability, but not exactly the same.
Anywho, I would recommend that anyone who wants to use BC.i as a wallet should create a new one and consider the old one compromised... in fact, maybe even wait until BC.i supports BIP32 and RFC6979, THEN create a new wallet.
In case anyone hasn't been following johoe, he gathered an extra 500 keys today...

Theoretically all encryption does is change orderly data that means something into garbage/random 1s and 0s based on your password.
The way people check if the password for decryption is correct is by attempting to decrypt, and if it comes out as garbage, then it's incorrect.
This is one of the reasons Electrum needs to know the MPK and keeps it unencrypted in the wallet file, as your seed is actually just random 1s and 0s to begin with, so you can't really tell without using it to generate the MPK and comparing it with the MPK in the wallet file.
Edit: my point is, theorhetically there's a password that will change your excel file into a CP jpeg file.

Yes, I read their statement. I also have a deep understanding of the Bitcoin protocol, and what's going on right now is not a problem with bitstamp software.
It is a bitcoin problem being exacerbated by the umpteenth degree by malicious nodes on the network. While the issue was known since 3 years, this is the first time the issue has hit the public spotlight since the spike in interest last November.
A temporary fix is already being implemented, but the core Bitcoin dev team needs to roll out a permanent fix soon...
Lots of people would love to see Bitcoin crash and burn, and lots more people would love to make the price crash and recover to make money off the day trading. This issue in the Bitcoin protocol needs to be addressed.
Just to clarify. Mt Gox is bad because they hid the fact that they were having issues for a long time, AND they admitted that their software couldn't handle even a single malleable transaction. Hiding this fact for so long is what makes them bad.

How about instead, we ignore the idea of "too small"... As this creates a barrier of entry that will prevent ChangeTip from going truly viral.
Imo, the spam aspect could be solved by any tip less than x bits on reddit automatically does not comment reply, and subsequent tips of low value don't each send a PM, but rather, they wait until the small tips add up to x bits, then send the second notification via PM.

Alex is advocating giving governments (the people who steal money from you and sell drugs for profit) the power to "whitelist" bitcoin addresses.
Aka, "Ok, we've vetted you, so you can use the Bitcoin protocol now, sir!"
This will obivously be touted as "to prevent money laundering and crime."
(and then subsequently be used by the people with whitelisting privilege to launder money. Because that's what governments do.)
But in reality, it will be used the SAME WAY current banking uses its vetting system. To charge outrageous fees to low income households and keep poor people in debt spirals until the end of time, just to line their pockets.
You live in compton? no whitelisted address for you!
You don't have enough collateral? no whitelisted address for you!
etc. etc.
Tainted coins is already a concept, but no one enforces it. The idea is, if a transaction is known to be a criminal transaction, then all transactions that inherit coins from those transactions are "tainted".
ie. if a 100 BTC tx is known to be from a drug deal, and that tx is referenced in another tx that splits into two outputs of 50 BTC each, then I make a tx using one of those 50 BTC inputs along with a 50 BTC input I got from an unrelated transaction. That tx will be known as 50% tainted with the known criminal coins, as 50% of the amount in bitcoins of the inputs is from a tainted transaction.
Logically, if whitelisted addresses are allowed, the government will be given the keys to the blockchain to deem transactions as "criminal" and to force the dev team to implement a rule that states "IF INPUTS ARE &gt; 20% TAINTED COINS, THEN REJECT TRANSACTION FROM BLOCKCHAIN AND SEND IP RELAY INFORMATION TO NSA AND FBI."
Ok, well... maybe the US government can be trusted. Let's just, assume that they can (though they've shown on numerous occasions that they CAN NOT be trusted).
What about any country where dictators control the people? A free and open Bitcoin is CRUCIAL to these people, because it allows them to transact with each other AWAY from the prying eyes of the government AND without the need to go outside and physically interact in a potential warzone.
The white list idea will lead to the destruction of Bitcoin.
Optional identity registration through Namecoin is fine, but starting a "whitelist" movement is the DUMBEST THING EVER.

You're making an argument for fiat vs. Bitcoin, really.
There is not ONE thing about Bitcoin that is any different from fiat except for decentralization and mining.
The only reason you don't see the features that Bitcoin SEEMS to have that fiat doesn't is because BANKING REGULATION PREVENTS IT. Thus, going back to the decentralized feature being the enabling agent for many other features.
Chase would never make a centralized chasecoin, they'd just lobby to get regulators to allow them to do more bitcoiny stuff with their current fiat system.

Can't Bitpay just make a Greenaddress.it clone? Any future problems solved.
Regardless, I think that zero conf instability is OCEANS better than the 3 month instability of a credit card. Folding a 10 minute highly technical attack vector as risk into your prices and folding a greater than 20% occurrent risk that can pop up in the following fiscal quarter for all you know into the price are completely different.
From a consumer perspective, sending the tx leaves no vulnerability for them.
The only vulnerability from the sender's perspective, fraud, could be negated by automatic behind the scene escrow. Which, again, could be implemented by copy pasting Greenaddress.it, or heck, partner up with / buy them.
Zero conf security is a reasonable risk at worst and a day or two of coding at best.

People whose identities are known are definitely living off their investments.
Satoshi is not known, and to estimate what he would do and what his motives are is a moot point.
You could never prove it, so why bother factoring Satoshi into the picture?
If I were Satoshi, I would be too afraid to move or even touch my funds, as just moving them from one address to another would tank my entire life's work into an abyss.
If he was smart, he would destroy his keys so as to never give anyone control of that many bitcoins. If course he'd probably keep a couple for himself, but to assume a person paranoid enough to encrypt all his emails would be totally fine having an economic kill-switch for the experiment he started and wants to succeed, is ludicrous to me.
But then of course you and I are both just guessing. My logic says destroying the keys is the best option. You think that holding on to 1/21 of the money supply and someday dumping it on the market is a good idea.
Two different ideas, but you can not demonstrate Satoshi has anything.

While I agree with this, the common sense needed to know not to run on the internet saying "hey, this service I use has a huge security hole in ABC" should be in your mind regardless of you "not being able to find contact info"
You could have made a post saying "I found a major vulnerability in Kraken and need their support contact info asap." and then you'd be fine.
Considering how many mail addresses get hacked and not touched daily (aka, are cracked, verified to be cracked by the hacker, then stored for later use so as not to alert the user) some hacker seeing your post could have run a search on the inboxes of all his hacked accounts he had searching for that mail, then procedurally run through each one stealing their bitcoins.

I would totally create a deterministic electrum wallet and have the master public key as my permanent seed, and the exchange performs each withdrawal on each sequential address.
This function is why I only use Electrum, and can't wait for their "Official" android app. (not the clanky python one out now)
If an exchange used this as their way of setting a permanent withdrawl scheme, and accepted Electrum Master Public Keys as inputs on sign up, I would totally switch to them.

paths are in format of `m\0\1\2\3'\4\5'\6` etc. an apostrophe denotes hardened keys.
ie breadwallet and Hive web use `m/0'/0'/c/k` where c = 0 for receive address 1 = change address... k = the order of keys counting up from 0.

To expand on mccorvic's post:
I think it has to do with the "if all my friends use it, it must be trustworthy" effect.
How many people *understand* how their money is safe in the banking system?
How many people just trust the banking system because everyone else does?
It's the same thing with bitcoin.
People think about Bitcoin based on hearsay and what the people around them in their lives say about Bitcoin.
The layman doesn't care about why Bitcoin works, nor do they care about why the current banking system works.
All they care about is "do my friends trust it? do my parents trust it? was I brought up on it? is it something I have experience with?" they could care less about fractional reserve lending and blockchain confirmations.
In that sense, Bitcoin is fighting an uphill battle.
So Bitcoin, in order to grow, needs to get to the point where "all my favorite stores and websites accept it, and all my friends use it... so I will too." is the common thought. No one will care about the details.

nanashi is Japanese, and it means "Anonymous"
The default name of a user on 2 channel (the Japanese origin of 4chan) is "nanashi-san" (though depending on which forum, they can change the default.)
The "nanashi" name is similar to calling someone "Anon" in English. All hacktivists I've ever read about on Japanese forums always refer to themselves as "nanashi."
"Nanashi" does not imply connection with Anonymous, and I have never heard of hacktivists in Japan dealing with Anonymous.
My theory is 1. s/he's Japanese. 2. s/he's a Russian person who is into Japanese culture / maybe lives in Japan?
I find that Japanese IT guys tend to name files, folders, and usernames or passwords as romanized Japanese words, so perhaps that aided him in finding the information he needed.
Tidbit: Most the time you can tell how old the IT admin at a company is by the names of the folders, if the syllables "shi" are spelled "si" and "chi" is spelled "ti" then usually it means they're at least older than mid-30s, and most likely dealt with computers in the 80s.

Which is why a cheapo air conditioning unit in Japan is all you need. The high tech energy saving ones don't make a difference.

6. in the box that says "m/0'/0/0" in text, type in `m/44'/0'/0'/0/0` and you will have your first receiving address of your first account.
7. `m/44'/0'/0'/0/1` is second address of first account. `m/44'/0'/0'/1/0` is first CHANGE address of first account. `m/44'/0'/1'/0/0` is first address of second account. etc. etc.
8. so in short `m/44'/0'/[A]'/[C]/[K]` where A is your account number starting with 0, C is change address (yes=1, no=0), and K is Bitcoin address counting from 0.

True. However, the mining fee isn't something that most people understand, and like the guy in this video, someone might just skip through it without knowing, or download a wallet app that doesn't calculate fees correctly, or any other plethora of things.
Robocoin should be most concerned with their User Experience, because that is what will turn away new customers.

Mycelium and Wallet32 for Android will accept the Trezor seed (those words that you already have written down) and any extra passphrase (the one you can set from the advanced options of Trezor) to restore your Trezor wallet 1:1 on their wallet... however, it does not use the Trezor device, so you are effectively moving your private keys OFF the Trezor... at which point it begs the question... "Why have a Trezor at all?"
It's good to know for emergencies which wallets are compatible with Trezor's HD wallet format, but you really should NOT be typing your seed into another wallet.
If it's an emergency, I suggest this:
1. input the seed into Mycelium or Wallet32.
2. Send the bitcoins wherever for whatever it was that was so urgent that you couldn't wait.
3. create a brand new wallet and seed for the Trezor, and send the remaining bitcoins there once myTrezor is back online.
Edit: currently no iPhone apps allow for Trezor's `m/44'/0'/k'/c/i` format. You can export your private keys directly using this site:  change the derivation path to "Trezor... (receive)" and "Trezor... (change)" and change the account and keypair indexes to view each private key separately.

The problem with M-Pesa is that it doesn't scale well.
There is no international cell provider, and if there was one company controlling all money all over Africa or the world, you can bet that some countries would regulate the heck out of them to the point of not working.
If you're of the camp that centralized control over funds at will by a "trusted party" is the best way to go, then sure... it might be the solution.
But you will have to wait for those "solutions" to pop up in every single country where they are needed.
Bitcoin is extremely easy to bootstrap and requires no infrastructure besides the internet. (Hint: all the businesses that are pushing Bitcoin are merely there to help adoption increase... IF Bitcoin ever took off as an ad hoc currency (meaning you don't have to on-ramp and off-ramp from and to fiat paper) There is really no need for all these companies.
Also, M-Pesa IS the solution for Kenya right now. However, there is no telling what kind of shenanigans the company behind M-Pesa might pull behind closed doors.
I think Bitcoin has a lot of maturing to do, and tbh I think a lot of people who push ideas (like the "unbanked" one you speak of) are talking about a hypothetical "matured" Bitcoin that has scaled and worked a lot of kinks out.

You can run the html file that you download from the project offline if you want (if you're super paranoid... but it's only like 100 lines of code and most of it is in plain English, so you won't see anything like SEND ( ALLURBITCOINZ ) TO 192.168.2.1 LOLZ; even if you don't know a lick of programming you should be able to verify the legitimacy of this github repository.)
Then just plug in your encrypted wallet (open it in a text editor and copy and paste all the text that comes up into the first area, then type in your SECONDARY password (the second one they ask for when you SEND bitcoins, not log in) and then BAM, your private keys are sitting on your screen.
If you PC is compromised, an attacker will see your Privkeys probably a short while after you decrypt them, so I would recommend maybe performing the decryption on a secure system if you have a large amount of bitcoins.

If you're holding the bitcoins you earn, it is.
If you immediately exchange every bitcoin you earn then it isn't.
Since OPs friend already plopped down the cash for the miner, and doesn't have to pay for electricity, he could hold the bitcoins if he thought the price would go up... Then if the price tripled in a month, his earnings from the previous month tripled in value.
Shortly thereafter, the mining power of the network would probably rise about three times as well, cutting his revenue to 1/3 ish.
However, the bitcoins earned before the price rise still rose in value 3 fold.
So price does matter.

This address had a 0.1 BTC output sitting on it, and it was about a month old, so bitWallet decided to choose it for the transaction, because using it rather than the 0.01737 BTC output you also had on your address meant you were able to send the transaction with 0 fees and get a fast confirmation.
The amount of inputs (in your case 0.1 BTC) must be equal to the amount of outputs + miner's fee. You had 0 miner's fee attached, so your outputs MUST add to 0.1.
You sent your friend 0.01556 BTC, so subtract that from 0.1 and you get 0.08444. This amount must be sent back to your own wallet.
In bitcoin, using the same address multiple times is not seen as a good idea. So in order to avoid this as much as possible, wallets create what are known as "Change addresses" in the background (some apps show them some apps hide them)
Think of it like you spent a 5 dollar bill to give your friend 1 dollar, and he gave you back 4 dollars.
You took a 0.1 bitcoin bill and broke it into one 0.01556 bitcoin bill and one 0.08444 bitcoin bill, at the same time, then sent the first bitcoin bill to your friend and the second one back to yourself.
Wallet developers tend to want to "simplify bitcoin for the layman" and hide a bunch of things... but in the end, people want to know what their money is doing, so like you did, newbies who know nothing about change etc. will go on blockchain.info and be confused when the app and the website say different things.
Your bitWallet app created a NEW address (1NdknR8W8tBSsHa91wzvtRo9wyz9NbkZYg) and sent your bitcoins there.
Check your bitWallet app all around and see if you can find it.
If your balance on your wallet says 0.36527 BTC total, then you are ok.
Also, it might have created a separate Address, so your balance might be split between two "wallets" now... I don't know how bitWallet shows these, but you should have all your bitcoins.

the ONE TIME, transactions were reverted because of a floating point bug that generated something like a billion bitcoins in one block when it should have been 50.
Things reverted back to before the block, but to be honest at the time the community was so small, everyone knew about it, and were able to adjust accordingly.
Here's what I would say to them about that one point.
"Blockchain security is based on chain depth. Most places that deal with any large sum of money wait for a few blocks, and anyone selling coffees accept these risks similar to the way they accept credit card chargebacks. Which, I may add, chargebacks don't require a catastrophic failure of the credit card system to happen, they happen all the time anywhere up to 3 months (~13,000 blocks) after the purchase, and people accept this risk... So when you compare it to legacy payment systems, we already have a leg up... but keep in mind that Bitcoin is still a big experiment... it could go either way, and you could actually make a difference in the world by supporting bitcoin and running tests for their repo, etc."
A catastrophic fork happened once. Before then everyone thought a fork of that magnitude would mean the end of Bitcoin, and it wasn't.
A catastrophic fork may happen again... but everyone hears the mantra "It's still an experiment" so people with lots of bitcoins are wise enough to take precautionary measures when transferring large amounts of bitcoins, escrow, multi-sig, etc.

Well, I wouldn't go as far to say 0 advantages.


Because of the fact that Bitcoin isn't for-profit, and is impartial, fees and transfer of value is extremely advantageous.
Of course, as of current, this comes with many disadvantages, such as volatility risk, difficulty of use, limit of uses (places that accept it), etc.
The reason Bitcoin is a prime candidate for mainstream usage over some other crypto is because it has all the advantages I mentioned above, but out of all the cryptos, it's the least volatile, the least difficult to use (thanks to a lot of sites/programs with easier interfaces), and the least limited in use (more people accept it over doge or darkcoin etc.).
OP is basically saying that "even if they convert to fiat, by allowing users to use their bitcoin at more places, it will lower the "limit of use" disadvantage"
If doge gets super easy to use, super stable, and super used everywhere, then why not doge? No one's stopping it. But as of right now, Bitcoin has a HUGE lead on every other crypto in the mainstream adoption curve.

Oic, you were confusing what he wanted for DH.
DH is where you multiply your PRIVATE key to their public key.
However, this reveals the private key to all parties of N from the getgo.
He said (untrusted) so I assumed he wanted the final private key to be secret until all collaborators joined together.

@_date: 2014-10-25 08:27:50
Just to clarify, your source is clean, but you're codebase is messy, and without running thorough testing, it is difficult to discern whether your code holds up under every possible private key and every possible outcome.
If you used the official ecdsa python libraries, I would be more open to giving a passing grade, but you coded your own crypto, which is a big no-no for consumer grade software.
Which is why I said I don't recommend it.
You also say yourself "I'm not responsible if you lose money!" which shows that you agree with me on this point.

First rule of data recovery:
If you Accidentally delete vital data. PULL THE PLUG.
Use a SEPARATE computer to run data recovery software on the Hard disk where you deleted the file.
If you don't have a separate computer. Get someone to set up a LiveUSB boot of Linux that contains data recovery software. (A lot of LiveUSB bootable "recovery tool distros" exist out there)
But if you spent hours on that hard disk googling stuff, there's a chance that the computer has overwritten the sector where that file was.
Turn off the computer, use a USB boot with recovery tools, and see if you can recover your file.

I understand the want for a single address that you can print on a business card for example, but if you do this, I would recommend Greenaddress.it because multisig addresses don't have the reuse insecurity of normal addresses.

Ok, whoa... I understand BIP32 and BIP39 and have implemented them about 3 times now... but I've never heard the term "hierarchy agnostic"
I would assume that when you give the user an option to backup, that Mycelium will give the user a backup for `m` and not some arbitrary branch like `m/0'/36/2678` as their backup. I would assume something like BIP39 or Electrum's mnemonic or some other method of conveniently allowing the user to back up would be offered.
Because of this, while, yes, you COULD choose any one of billions of indexes for each level, since choosing at random would negate ANY sort of discovery algo and eliminate the utility of BIP32, so having a set starting point (like the one BIP44 points out) for account discovery upon recovery is crucial.
I still don't really get what the person meant by "agnostic"... that word and my thorough understanding of BIP32 wallets do not mix together... maybe they have some different idea of what agnostic means...

This happened to me once. I live in Japan.
In Japan you pay residence tax from June 2012 til May 2013 monthly based on your earnings for June 2011 to May 2012. And you pay it to the ward you lived in on Jan. 1st 2012.
So the ward I lived in 3 years ago apparently didn't process my documents for moving out of the ward properly. (Thank GOD I saved copies)
They were sending me bills to my old address in their ward for months even though I was paying happily to my new ward. I had no clue, and the 1 year mail forwarding service from the post office had expired.
They took this as tax evasion and withdrew everything from my account.
I called the bank, had to pry teeth to find out who did it. Then called them and the guy treated me like a criminal asking me where the rest of my funds were and that he'd arrest me if I was hiding money from them as my balance didn't cover a whole year of taxes.
Meanwhile I had no money. My wife's mom lent us money while we waited.
I had to go, in person, with copies of all the documents proving they were full of shit and they wouldn't see me. So I knocked on the mayor's office door.
Luckily he was a GGG and told the dumbass in the tax dept. to return my funds and that they were wrong.
However, not once did anyone apologize.
I got my money back. My friends told me "be grateful they gave you the money back"
The brainwashing... Seriously...
And now, Bitcoin.

How do you prove that someone isn't just hiding all their balances and just signing 2 addresses with 2 BTC when they actually own 5 addresses with 200K BTC?
You can't.
Though I guess one way of proving it would be to force them to put sensitive information in the signed message. AKA something that the auditor could know and the signer could know, but that if a third party (the person you'd get to sign for you in your example) learned of could cause huge damage, so it would be safe to assume they wouldn't divulge it to anyone... maybe your Social Security Number or something idk.

Let's assume ASICs and whatnot don't evolve, that 1 MHash/s doesn't get any cheaper, and that the bitcoin price doesn't go up.
Companies based in bitcoin with millions to lose if the network crashes will perform backroom deals to make sure there is significant hashing power supporting the network. Miners might not stand to benefit, but as long as someone stands to lose millions, that person will make whatever deal is necessary to ensure they don't lose those millions... like funding miners behind the scenes.
But, if we are rational and know that hashing will become cheaper and price of bitcoin will go up. This won't be an issue until a long ways away, if at all.
If bitcoin crashes, then this is irrelevant.

Committer and long time fan of Electrum here:
The wordlist you are referring to is the Electrum wordlist.
This mnemonic method pre-dates BIP39 and is still in use with the current release 1.9.8 of Electrum.
A lot of services implemented the Electrum mnemonic method BEFORE BIP39 even was passed, and that is why they still use them.
Now to go into geek territory:
You mentioned that 1626 words is less secure than 2048 words, but unfortunately, this is not true.
The BIP39 protocol calls for a checksum to be included in the phrase, so every possible combination of words is NOT a valid phrase.
To give specifics, 2048 is 2^11 which means "11 bits of entropy"... however, for every 3 word group (33 bits) one of those bits is used as a checksum. This means that 3 words only contain 32 bits of entropy.
1626 is more than 10 bits (1024 words) but less than 11 bits (2048 words) of entropy. When grouped into 3 words like the BIP39 states. we get 1626^3 = 4,298,942,376 combinations. If you then look at the number of valid combinations for 3 word pairs of BIP39, it is 2^32 (32 bits of entropy) = 4,294,967,296... so BIP39 is slightly less in the "number of possible outcomes" department.
There are many benefits and demerits to both methods, like Electrum being a way to mask data, and BIP39 being strictly a method to generate a phrase to be hashed.
Because Electrum's mnemonic allows any combination of words as a valid wallet, plausible deniability is much easier. Switch out two words and deposit a few millis, and if anyone ever held you at gunpoint you could show them how you only have a few millis. BIP39 makes up for this with the "optional password" function, that currently only Trezor and Mycelium (restore only) support. (Every password generates a valid wallet)
For instance, DarkWallet uses Electrum's old mnemonic method.
Electrum 2.0 will have the old mnemonic for backwards compatibility's sake, but every new wallet made in 2.0 onward will use BIP39.

Do you have a password on your Electrum wallet?
If so, open that wallet file with a text editor.
Then search the file for the word 'seed'
You should see something that looks like this:
    'seed': 'beg33dsf2............EzbwPvg=='
(those dots are just to make it shorter. it's pretty long.
The gibberish betweeen the '' after the 'seed': is your seed encrypted by AES with your wallet password.
The encrypted AES data is then coded into base64.
So to decrypt that gibberish, decode base64 (including all "=" symbols at the end) then decrypt that decoded string using AES and your password.
If you are looking to encrypt using human readable words similar to the worded seed... then you might have to do some more work.
Edit: You could decode the base64, then convert the 64 byte AES encrypted seed using BIP39 into a 48 word English phrase. BIP39 includes a checksum, so messing up the order of the words would return an error if you implemented it correctly.

A transaction can have one OP_RETURN output with a max of 40 bytes contained in it. This type of transaction is viewed as "standard."

I used to give away bitcoin to newbies, set up a wallet for them. Send the bitcoin to their address, explained how to maintain it.
a few months later Bitcoin booms, and they say "oh hey I forgot my login and password for the bitcoin site, what is a "recovery phrase""
I set them up with breadwallet, and they were trying to log into blockchain.info. I asked where the recovery phrase was and they said "oh I thought I could just password reset to my email"...
1. You never entered your email into breadwallet.
2. I explicitly told you the recovery phrase is EVERYTHING. No password resets.
Of course, I said it in a much kinder manner.
Now they think I stole it.
From then on:
1. I securely generate a BIP39 phrase offline.
2. I keep a copy.
3. When I set them up with a wallet I put in the BIP39 phrase, and don't tell them I have the copy.
4. If they deposit 0.0001 BTC or 100BTC, I don't steal it. (to be honest I don't even watch the addresses...)
5. Then one day when they come asking me to "help them login" I pull it out and recover for them.
6. I don't get accused of stealing. Though I'm sure someone smart enough to figure out what I'm doing is not secure from their perspective will notice it the moment I try to recover a phrase I pulled out of my wallet to create their "new" wallet. lol
The only way to 100% prevent people from calling you a thief is to just not give people Bitcoin...
But imo, my "backing up" of the seed for them isn't really stealing unless I go in and move their bitcoin into a seed only I control...
I do mention to them that "If you get serious with Bitcoin, you should buy a hardware device to manage your bitcoins and generate a new phrase on that device." which some people have done.

Let's assume that a dictionary has 2048 words in it (there's more, but just to give you the benefit of the doubt) and someone tries what you said.
As you probably learned in grade school, probability of picking one jelly bean out of a jar with 5 jelly beans is 1/5, but picking a unique jelly bean "A" from the jar, putting it back and mixing up the jar and picking it again you multiply 5 by 5 and you get a 1/25 chance of picking the same jelly bean twice. Let's apply this to the 2048 words.
At 1,000 tries per second: (changing units as I go along, to two decimal places)
1 word = 2.05 secs (yup, not secure at all)
2 words = 69.91 mins (not this one either)
3 words = 99.42 days (well, you could stay in Japan on a visitor's visa and come home, but still not safe)
4 words = 557.84 years (well THAT escalated quickly...)
5 words = 1,142,465.66 years (...)
6 words = 2,339,769,669.42 years (...?)
7 words = 4,791,848,282,972.75 years (...!!!)
Just for reference, it is estimated that the universe is only 13.7 billion years old... so a 7 randomly chosen words from a 2048 word dictionary password would be cracked with a 0.287% probability @ 1000 guesses per second IF the hacker started at the birth of the universe.
2048^7 in scientific notation is 4.79 x 10^12 and in binary notation is 2^77
Also to give perspective, the bitcoin address space is 2^160... yeah, if you ever generate a bitcoin address even with a HISTORY of being related to any transactions, go buy a lottery ticket RIGHT NOW lol.

It is!
And yet it's insanely hard to crack, as any combination of words from Electrum's wordlist creates a valid seed, AND to generate addresses from the seed requires hashing the seed against itself 100,000 times, so brute forcing would take a reeeeeally long time.

A large portion of miners haven't upgraded.
Until they do, be safe and stick with the old system.
If you divide every fee I said by 10, 30% of the miners would see your transaction as having enough fees. Thus confirmation would take on average over 30 minutes to get the first confirm, then normal after that.

I was explaining the "price difference in BTC" being discussed. It seemed like some people were misinterpreting the conversation to be about price volatility and starting saying "... But... Bitpay!

No, but the bank has your address, signature, social security, all your money at their fingertips (and can decide not to give it to you if they see fit)... a bank ATM is "hey, give me MY MONEY that YOU'RE HOLDING" and they can say no... and they know you better than most of your friends, they know everything you spend your money on, they don't need your palm, they've already got you by the balls.
A bitcoin ATM is "hey, exchange y cash for x BTC from me." From you, a complete stranger to Robocoin. They don't know you, you could be a meth dealer for all they know.
If the company says "ok!" and does nothing to verify who you are (note: they DON'T have your address, signature, social security, or any of your money in their possession) then what happens if a drug dealer decides to use the ATM to turn BTC from a silk road clone into USD?
The ATM operator (robocoin), the owner of the place where the ATM is placed, and anyone involved are liable to GO TO JAIL FOR MONEY LAUNDERING. The only person who benefits from this is the criminal who wants to launder money. If Robocoin went to jail for money laundering, you'd lose all the ATMs, Bitcoin would be sang as a cesspool for money laundering, and it will take EVEN LONGER for wide adoption to take place.
Final note:
Give it time.
Regulation and laws surrounding Bitcoin in the US are currently uncertain, and depending on the state or the federal government and what each of them think about Bitcoin, it might be a while before Bitcoin ATMs will be biometric data free (if ever)... but wait it out.
Right now they're only taking infrared pics of your palm veins, not your finger prints. There is no record of palm veins on police records or hospital records, they just want to make sure that if the police says "account  on your ATMs looks suspicious, as it could be money laundering, please share the picture ID scan with us"... if they didn't take the palm veins, a criminal could say "heyheyhey! it wasn't me I swear! my drug buddy stole my driver's license!!!"
To which (in the current situation) they could scan his palm veins, match it with the veins on the account, and BOOM, a conviction. Robocoin doesn't go to jail, and criminal does.
They will only use your data if you are suspected of something.
Until laws change, either take it or leave it. If you don't like it, don't use it. Let the free market decide whether Robocoin should stay or not. "Vote with your dollars" (and bitcoins)

Re: Mining.
If you're ok with getting BTC at a markup price of +50% or more, than Mining might be ok for you. If your sole goal is to "buy" BTC through mining.
However, Mining is not easy, and if you don't put in a large (maybe a couple k) investment to start with, everyone will just leave you in the dust, and your payments will get smaller and smaller.
If you have access to cash or something else, I would recommend buying bitcoin over mining. But if you are super paranoid and want no human interaction, Mining might be an option. But expect to pay a lot for a small bitcoin stream.

When you run out of addresses, the wallet creates random new ones.

    priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytes
So for example, a free tx is eligible to 1 BTC that is in a 250 byte transaction that has been sitting for a day (144 blocks)... so...
    (100000000 * 144) / 250 = 57600000
So as long as you have a priority of 57600000 or larger, every output of the transaction is over 0.01 BTC, and the tx is 1,000 bytes or less, you're eligible for free tx... Let's see, for instance, how much BTC you would need to send a free tx in every block forever?
    ( x * 1 ) / 1000 = 57600000
    x = 57600000000 (satoshis)
    x = 576 BTC
So if you had 576 BTC, and you kept your ouputs at or above 0.01 BTC and your tx at or below 1,000 bytes... you could send it around for all eternity, every single block. (though you are not guaranteed to be included in a block.)
You could try a normal one... most transactions are 259 bytes... so let's find out how much bitcoins we'd need to send 1 free transaction every week.
    ( x * 1008) / 259 = 57600000
    x = 14800000
    x = 0.148 BTC

I will get to the other points later, I have to go to sleep. But this part is grossly misinformed.
That would be like me saying "If I flip a penny 1 million times and take 500,000 of those flips at random, I will get 100% heads or 100% tails, there's no way I could get a mixture."
You could flip 80% heads and 20% tails and that would be ok.
I could mine a block in 5 seconds with my crappy computer... highly unlikely, but you need to remember, even if the 51% attacker is drawing at a faster rate, the time it takes to find a block is based on distributed chance and is not a "oh he's driving a car 2 mph faster than that other guy so he will always be faster".
saying 100% in probability does not mean "it will always happen" it just means "if the probability is 100% or greater, and it still hasn't happened... you are insanely unlucky."

You said that SIDEDOGE was created by 1 BTC being pegged. That means the ENTIRE 100% of SIDEDOGE will always be worth 1 BTC.
If you unpeg y SIDEDOGE, where z = the whole supply of SIDEDOGE, then you will get 1 x (y / z) BTC.
So if you pegged 1 BTC to create SIDEDOGE chain, and then had 100 SIDEDOGE and the whole supply was 1000 SIDEDOGE at the time of unpegging, you would get 1BTC x (100 SIDEDOGE / 1000 SIDEDOGE)... which would be 0.1 BTC.
Then, after that point, you could make as many SIDEDOGE as you want, but 100% of the whole system will only be worth 0.9 BTC.

Coinbase is an off-blockchain business.
That means you send them the bitcoins, and they send them to their wallets for safe and secure storage... meanwhile you just sit there and have to trust that the number they show you on their website is the amount of bitcoins they actually have under your name.

They have since updated bitcoinjs-lib, and so any new addresses generated now will be (supposedly) safe (unless a new rng vulnerability is found).
However, if you have any significant amount of bitcoins, you should NOT be storing them all on any services.
Roll a 6 sided dice 99 times, write down each result changing any 6 roll into a 0 when you write it down.
Go to bitaddress.org on an offline computer. Go to "Wallet Information" tab and input your 99 digit 0-5 numbers into the entry box.
It will generate a private key and public key.
Write down the "Compressed Private Key" (Starts with K or L) on a piece of paper. Once you're done writing it down, reload the page and return to the Wallet Information page. type in the Private Key you wrote down (that starts with K or L) and click OK to see if it gives you a proper bitcoin address. (if the letters are incorrect it will give you an error, this is to check if you wrote it down correctly.)
If everything is ok, copy and paste the COMPRESSED Bitcoin address. (compressed private key can only spend the bitcoins in the compressed bitcoin address and vice versa) then save that in a txt file or something.
Close bitaddress, remove the bitcoin address txt file and bring it to your online pc.
This method is pretty much fool proof.
Edit: I usually keep a max of 0.1 BTC on blockchain.info, and maybe 0.05 on other mobile wallets I have. The bulk of my bitcoin holdings are in a couple addresses generated in the above fashion.

After the Put password on wallet step:
1. Click on the "Wallet" tab then click "Master Public Key". Copy down this code to a text file or something (there should be a notepad-esque program in the apps menu of Ubuntu, if not, open up the terminal and type in "gedit" and hit enter.) * Remember: Ubuntu's window toolbars are similar to MacOS in that they are not on the smaller window itself, but on the very top of the screen.
2. take the file with this Master Public Key and save it to a USB memory stick or something. Then install electrum on your online computer (the one that you use every day) and when starting the program for the first time, choose "Create watch-only wallet" and input your Master Public Key.
3. This "Watch-only wallet now has the ability to create new addresses, check total balance of all your funds etc. but WITHOUT storing the private keys on your online machine.
4. Whenever you want to send bitcoin from your offline wallet, sending from your "watch-only wallet" will automatically save a .txn unsigned transaction file. Save this to USB memory stick and load it into the offline electrum, then you can sign it, save the signed transaction to USB, then load the signed transaction into the online watch-only wallet and broadcast it.
This is very useful.

I recommend consolidating first.
Send the the exact amount of coins to one address in order to reduce the number of outputs to 1. Do this with no fee and just wait a couple hours or days for your first confirmation.
Then you're good.
If you're using a normal address, each input script will be 139 bytes per if the output is to an uncompressed address, 107 bytes if the address is compressed. If you send the amount exactly (ie no change needed) the output, if normal should only be about 34 bytes.
The recommended fee is 0.0001 btc per kilobyte size rounded up. So 1.1 kilobyte tx recommended fee is 0.0002 btc etc.
Assuming compressed addresses. 107 x 42 inputs is 4494 bytes, plus about 34 bytes per output, then the rest of the bytes of the transaction.
If uncompressed, add about 1344 bytes.
So 0.0005 btc fee if compressed address, 0.0007 btc fee if uncompressed.
Which is a fee of $0.23 - $0.32.
But like I said above, you could consolidate using a no fee tx if you can wait.
Note: This works out to a 1% - 1.4% fee if you compare to the 0.05 you have. Which is still small.

I know this is a month old post... but I found something similar to what you are talking about on a tech forum. Address reuse opens you up to weak random number generators.
As long as the random number generator used by the program signing transactions is good, you should be fine. However, sometimes programs rely on RNGs that are tied to the OS. If there is a bug in the OS's Random Number Generator, there could be catastrophic failure, and loss of bitcoins.
If you hold bitcoin on an address that has never signed anything. (aka you received any number of bitcoin transactions but have not spent any bitcoins from it) Random Number Generators only affect you once (during private key generation) but if you reuse addresses, you're pulling a lottery of two signatures using the same random number, which means you're pulling a lottery of getting your bitcoins stolen.
QT's RNG is pretty good. But still, that doesn't mean EVERY bitcoin wallet's RNG is good, so this was created to set an example of "good habits"
Scary stuff. Here's real life example using an old forum post to prove the concept.

I am just saying that the possibility it there. Even if you think it's an "idiotic" idea. Just like there's a possibility you and I can generate the same private keys randomly. So low that it's negligible, but to say "there is no possibility" is an outright lie, it is not true.
In the same way, saying "Circle does not take a spread because the numbers shown on the screen were the same." is not true. There is still a possibility that they are taking a spread. Maybe a super small spread + a little fluctuation just happened to make the numbers the same, or a big spread + big fluctuation just happened to make the numbers the same, or who knows they could be flat out lying to us with this demo.
All of these cases are less than 20% likely I'm sure. Maybe 1% or 0.0001% likely, I have no clue. BUT to say "Circle doesn't take a spread." is incorrect.
If you find evidence to prove otherwise, I'll admit I was wrong. But seeing as every other business before them takes spreads on exchanges, I will assume they do too.
If you think that assumption based on the facts is not a good assumption, then you're entitled to your opinion. And anyone with two brain cells will take a post on reddit with a grain of salt, so no one is looking at my post and thinking "OMGOSH CIRCLE TAKES A SPREAD, I KNOW IT CUZ A GUY ON REDDIT SAID IT!" They know that my post is just my prediction, hence my opinion.

Even if your private key has never touched the net, you are revealing your public key and 1 r value for your signature.
Using the pubkey in an attack is much less likely, but unless your client uses deterministic signatures (like Electrum), signing on an offline computer for the same address multiple times runs the risk of low entropy leading to r value collisions. An r value collision is basically the same as embedding your private key into the blockchain for everyone to see.
So no, it's not really "just as safe"
Edit: sorry, I just actually read your post.
CEASE THIS METHOD IMMEDIATELY.
Brainwallet is notorious for random number collision, so even if you ran it on a computer with all the entropy in the world, an r value collision with your signatures is very very possible.
Bottom line, DONT REUSE ADDRESSES.

Not a core dev, but basically here's what's going on:
There's a rule ingrained in the bitcoin protocol that says: "A coin that was recently minted with less than 100 confirmations may not be spent."
Every single wallet software out there has accounted for this in their code to say "duhhhhhh, if the coin is less than 100 confirmations old don't use it."
Mt. Gox uses an independently developed software that manages all of their bitcoin transactions automatically for them. They do NOT have the code for this software open and available for the world to see, so this means the only people "working on fixing it" are the handful of devs in their company.
They stopped BTC withdrawals to fix the transaction malleability issue (which they claim is fixed) BUT they also were KNOWN to have an issue of trying to spend newly mined coins (thus causing failed transactions)
OP basically is saying: "They spent a long time with withdrawals closed, "fixing the problem," and yet they still haven't fixed this stupid problem that is easy to fix, that everyone knew about."
I personally take that to mean "this shows a lack in management skills and/or development skills in the company."

it's not a bug. It's an oversight on the part of wallet developers.
SIGHASH_SINGLE was a feature for people to sign off on the input and allow a third party to decide the outputs after the fact. That is as it was designed.
However, due to lack of popularity, Copay ignored the possibility that someone could have generated their own transaction with the SIGHASH_SINGLE in it... this meant that users had no clue that the transaction could be altered after signing.
The "fix" for this is for developers to check the transaction being signed for the hashtype and change the UI to reflect that so users know what it does, OR just refuse transactions that are not SIGHASH_ALL (the normal default for every wallet on the sun)

Faster method:
1. Download  and torrent the bootstrap.dat file (it's a laaaaaaaaaaarge file... but torrent is much faster than downloading through the QT client.)
2. Download and install the QT client from the Easy method, and run it once. Once the user interface shows up, close it from the toolbar (make sure it's not running in the background.) then find the Bitcoin data folder (for windows 7 C:\Users\&lt;your name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin )
3. place the huge bootstrap.dat file in that data directory. Then start the Bitcoin-QT program.
4. Let it synch the rest of the blockchain.
5. Once you're done and up to date, leave it on and make sure port 8333 is forwarding to your computer (if you have a router)
If it's done downloading the blockchain, and you leave it there for a couple hours and you still only have 8 or less connections (hover your mouse over the connection status icon in the lower right of the QT's window) then your 8333 port isn't forwarding correctly and you should open it.

Robocoin is merely registering its users like a bank, and I think it would be much different if they made branches and forced you to drive all the way to the branch and pull a number, wait in line, fill out forms, wait a week to receive account details, etc. like a bank.
People would be up in arms, even though they gladly bend over for any joe schmoe with the word "bank" in their company name.
If you just want bitcoin, other ATMs offer USD to Bitcoin only for almost no identification.
If you want USD from bitcoin, they have to be able to track you down if theft, fraud, or money laundering happens, just like banks won't "take your word for it" that you are who you say you are.
Planning ahead ftw. Just because most people assume that they can convert Bitcoin into USD without ID doesn't mean they can.

The problem with BIP39 seeds is that they require a checksum... which can't be generated easily with a human hand. (good luck doing sha256 on paper)
One of the reasons for this choice was to disallow low entropy human inputs. (ie. I could look at the electrum wordlist and put in "happy happy joy joy" and that would generate a valid wallet....... and be super insecure.)
The thought being people who roll their own dice would be savvy enough to figure out how to run their entropy through a BIP39 generator to generate the checksum.
I could probably whip something up. I have a BIP32/BIP39 suite for a Japanese alt that I made a while back @

If not Bitpay, you would be irresponsible to not record when someone tried to scam you. Not to mention that just looking up the successful txid on blockchain.info will give you a link to the double spend tx, as blockchain.info keeps record of every tx it sees, confirmed or not.
Bitpay covers any loss from double spends 100% and will reimburse the merchant. It says so in their ToS. They mentioned in an article not to long ago that there were almost no double spend attempts towards them at all, and that most merchants accepted 0 confirm as payment.
So pardon me if I find your story a tad hard to believe.

Stop........... Using............... Real................ BTC............ On.............. Darkwallet.
Seriously guys. You have no idea how unstable the build is right now.
They could decide to change the stealth address branching mechanism at the same time as changing the format of the ephemkey storage on obelisk, and you would have no method of recovering your bitcoins except to cry on github for a way to restore old version wallets.
Seriously, use testnet if you want to play around with it, but using real BTC could get you seriously burned.

Bread wallet uses m/0'/0/k for receiving addresses and m/0'/1/k for change addresses.
It looks like you'll have to create two separate "wallets" for both of those branches, and it looks like BitWallet requires you to tap "create address" in order to discover addresses beyond the first 3.
Give it a try, create two wallets using the default and inner branches, then check the first "account" of each of those wallets.
Then click new address of each of those until you find the addresses you need.
I find it interesting that they implemented Bip32 but they didn't implement change accounts and automatic discovery with gap limits... Hmmm.

In terms of security, BIP32 &gt; Electrum's algo.
Unless you made up your own arbitrary algorithm based on Electrum's... But then you wouldn't be compatible with Electrum anyways, so the question remains why not BIP32?
If it's the Python aspect, there are tons of examples and libraries using BIP32, BIP39 etc.
What is the goal? Compatibility with Electrum?

Question: How do you get back a 100 dollar bill you handed over to someone that then ran away from you without giving you the product?
Bitcoin is just barely starting to scratch the surface with merchants. Not to mention that most of the big-name companies in the bitcoin space (Bitpay, Coinbase, etc.) are still VERY amateur when you compare them to some of these banks etc that have been around for many many years. Not to mention they are creating a completely new method of dealing with finances, and this takes time.
I personally believe that a service that works similar to Paypal will come up soon, with chargebacks enabled with Bitcoin. In the background they will take funds from your account and give the funds to the merchant in their account with a big asterisk saying that withdrawals over their fraud protection insurance limit will be processed at the shortest 30 days after receiving funds etc.
In other words, centralized companies using Bitcoin to FACILITATE transactions, but maintaining full control of private keys, can mimic the functionality of old-fogey bank practices.
Meanwhile, those that are more tech-savvy / risk tolerant can use third party freelance escrow services based on online reviews etc. and send the funds to escrow and handle any disputes on a case by case basis.
Implementing something as wishy washy as "chargebacks" into the Bitcoin protocol itself would be like saying any citizen can print their own cash if they felt like their cash was stolen. It would make no sense.

Coinbase can't send micro-payments to e-mail addresses. That's because the send-by-e-mail function basically sends them a voucher for bitcoins that they can redeem IF they create an account.
The 0.0002 BTC fees and 0.0000546 BTC limit are because these e-mail messages give the option to the redeemer to send the BTC on-chain to an outside bitcoin address. If it turns out that they must send via the blockchain, they need to have a fee and it must be higher than 0.0000546 BTC to send.
If you want to send micro-payments to another person with a coinbase account, it should work fine. The send-by-e-mail was not meant for micropayments.

The software and the network has no way of knowing if your pubkey is on the secp256k1 curve or not, because you don't use the pubkey when creating a transaction, you use the pubkey hash. A hash can be any 20 byte integer from all 0x00s to all 0xffs.
You wouldn't realize it was invalid until you tried to spend it and the software told you "nope you don't have the private key for this pubkey! (because it's based off the wrong curve)
But yeah, if any software did that, you'd know about it like 5 seconds into it. Everyone would be all over the message boards screaming about it.
But a good lesson. Whenever trying out a new piece of software or a new feature. TEST WITH SMALL AMOUNTS FIRST. and test to make sure you can recover funds to something you're more comfortable with just in case.

It's Restore &gt; QR code &gt; scan the QR code of your Master Public Key...
Edit: I just tried it out, and this is correct.
1. Tap Restore
2. Tap QR code
3. Scan the QR code of your Master Public Key that is displayed when you click Master Public Key on the Desktop client
4. It will say "Incorrect Password" a couple times, but this is because Electrum is trying to show you your seed, but there is no seed. If you click options &gt; seed, it should pop up with "Incorrect password" screen even though you were never asked to make a password. This means you properly created a watch-only wallet.
Edit 2: Also note that if you replace Step 3 with the QR code that shows up by clicking "Show Seed" on the desktop client, you will get a wallet that you can spend from. Typing on cell phones is slow, so people tend to make short insecure passwords for cell phone wallets. This is OK as long as you know that you could be hacked, and only keep small amounts on it. If you have large amounts, Use a watch only wallet etc.
Also, if you want to keep multiple wallets on your Android, the current version of Electrum android doesn't have a switching function, so you'll have to use a File Manager app and do the following:
1. Find "electrum.dat" file on your SD card memory's root. (/mnt/sdcard/)
2. Rename the "electrum.dat" to anything else, like "electrum.dat.old" or "electrum_old.dat" or something.
3. Start Electrum, and it will ask you to create a new wallet or restore a new wallet.
4. To restore your old wallet, rename the new wallet's "electrum.dat" to something else, then rename the old "electrum.dat.old" (or whatever you called it) back to "electrum.dat"
5. As long as you don't delete the file, you can rename it as many times as you would like, and electrum will always load the file called "electrum.dat"

The only thing stopping me now is the fact that I don't have a US credit card to fool Steam into selling me at US prices.
If they accepted BTC, I'd VPN + BTC to buy at US prices to the moon for all my games! It'd be amazing!

When using a system like bitpay, they credit you instantly in your currency.
Things to look out for as "suspicious" is if they try to send bitcoin without any transaction fees.
To be honest, though, a 0% fraud rate is non-existant, not with paper money (counterfeit) not with Credit Cards (charge backs, stolen CC purchases)
A double spend on the bitcoin network as is would be near impossible, and the amount of work to create a double spend would cost millions of dollars, and unless they worked as a team with conspirators, could not be performed at the register from a cell phone.
Your 5-100 EU everyday purchases will be fine.

To add on the 1% is too much idea:
1. Caps? A max withdrawal fee of 0.001 etc.
2. Allow fee free withdrawals up to amount deposited from direct deposit. aka as long as the withdrawal history total is less than the top-off deposit history total (not money tipped to you) then you charge no fees.
 would effectively be saying "anyone who inserted their own bitcoin from outside and took a chance on us, we will let you withdraw that same amount out free of charge. However, any gains facilitated from our service (ie people who receive tips but don't deposit) will be subject to 1% up to a certain point etc.
I think it would be a good way of viewing the fee model imo. tbh, keeping funds tipped to you in the tipping service and taking your own hard earned BTC and depositing it with a service that controls your keys are completely different in the commitment levels imo.

It's fun to do thought exercises.
I always wanted to start a coin with similar rewards, except after the first halving, it would just start gradually decreasing instead.
so like:
    if nBlocks &lt; 210001:
        BlockReward = 5000000000
    else:
        BlockReward = ((-2205*(10**17)/nBlocks)+21*(10**14)) - ((-2205*(10**17)/(nBlocks-1))+21*(10**14))
But yeah, it seemed like the halving thing was fine. If it becomes a problem, we can fix it... but for now it's fine as is.
Edit: If you have python here's a one-liner that will tell you what the block reward will be for my equation. (Set range(210001,210002) to any range of block numbers.
    print '
'.join("Block  reward: %d Satoshis" % (i, ((-2205*(10**17)/i)+21*(10**14)) - ((-2205*(10**17)/(i-1))+21*(10**14))) for i in range(210001,210002))

They will accept xprv keys for wallet restoration... however they will not allow you to choose the hierarchy, and you will be stuck using m/0/k for receiving and m/1/k for change. (note: no other BIP32 wallet uses these hierarchies. most use m/0'/k and m/0'/k ie. Hardened branches or the BIP44 methodology.)
Not to mention Electrum does not support BIP39. It will continue to use the Electrum wordset and mnemonic generation algorithm...

Some of the regulations are very reasonable, I agree.
However, some of the regulations in the proposal blatantly break other existing laws. ie. in NY labor laws it is illegal to require employees below executive level to provide fingerprints as a requirement of employment... yet the regulation says that even the janitor needs to give their fingerprints to work at a Virtual Currency related business.
Also, the definitions of what a Virtual Currency business is are very VERY broad. Those definitions NEED to be specified, otherwise this will just be a disguised method of destroying Bitcoin's future through regulation.
Not to mention there is a clause that states "all Virtual Currency businesses must hold 100% of their profits in US dollars." This means if you're a company based out of Germany and you want to keep your profit in Euros, or bitcoins... if you have even ONE customer in NY, you ARE REQUIRED TO KEEP YOUR PROFIT 100% in DOLLARS.
so yeah... there are a few good parts, and a TON OF BAD PARTS.
That is why everyone is upset.
also, some people would say "all regulation is bad." so there are those people too... but I would say most people are the former.

genjix, a really smart guy, one of the lead devs on Dark Wallet, and overall anti-establishment, wrote a post condemning Circle for not answering questions about possible surveillance and tracking technologies and whether or not it would be using them on their customers.
These questions were originally brought up by Peter Todd, also a very smart individual and fellow lead dev for Dark Wallet (though he claims to be "advisor" I think...). Personality-wise, Peter is eccentric to say the least, but I would rather call him passionate about what he believes (also read: "agenda" if you want to view it that way)
Peter and Mike Hearn (again, smart guy, but Peter and genjix would say that he is pro-regulation, pro-surveillance, pro-blacklisting coins etc.) butt heads a lot on the mailing list and bitcointalk. For reasons I mentioned.
Now you know the background. The summary of the post is as follows:






**Disclaimer**: I am a big fan, and supporter of genjix and Peter, so my post, though I tried to be as neutral as I could, will probably stink of bias. Sorry, I am only human.
To Genjix, Peter, and Mark:
Remember, name calling will not win anything, nor will censorship. Fight with your brains and your code, not with silly politics. Open source should be a hotbed of heated arguments, otherwise we're not doing it right.

I am pretty sure the idea of brainwallets / BIP39 mnemonic seeds for HD wallets is something you can easily move offline without needing to rely on physical backup media solely.
With a picture file, if every piece of physical media burns up in a fire, you're done... but with a 12 word seed, you can memorize it fairly easily. Even if you have amnesia, you can write 12 words down on paper, take a picture of it, send it to your grandmother via morse code, or whatever... whereas your method will consist of USB thumb drives... maybe dropbox? But dropbox won't be safe the second this new wallet method catches any popularity.

Why convert them? Just don't use them at all. (ie. push them into the background)
NFC data transfers, BIP70 payment protocol between personal users, QR codes... these are all ways to guarantee payment between two parties without the need for addresses.
An address, like your routing number for your checking account, is not something you need every day. Having it be CORRECT rather than LOOK GOOD is more important.
In fact, base58 was created with the intent of hiding the hexidecimal data underneath it using letters in the alphabet that people can understand.
Would you rather we have random word phrases?
Using BIP39 or something similar you could represent a bitcoin address with a string of 16 random English words.

You are also aware that AML KYC laws only exist to steal money from small time criminals and ENSURE MONEY LAUNDERING FOR BIGGER CRIMINALS.

Not really a rant. Just stating that this whole "feud" of the fors and againsts of blockchain.info, to me, is like the war between VHS and Betamax... Sure you can argue both sides, but I view it as irrelevant.
Also, if you truly believe blockchain.info has no competition, then why bother defending a monopoly? Everyone has no choice but to use blockchain.info if it's a monopoly... So why bother?
Browser / mobile app combo wallets that give users control of the keys are more common than you would think.
are just a few.
And also Electrum will have a new Android (and iOS later) app with multisig 2fa built into it if you want (with Electrum 2.0)
Not exactly web-based, but definitely cool.
Basically, I'll use blockchain.info again once their block explorer stops bugging out and their wallet service implements BIP39/32/44 etc. while also not having the default setting for their wallet be a hacker's wet dream.
That last point, apparently, they have fixed. But I'm still not sold on them yet, ever since I left.
@_date: 2014-09-06 18:38:34
got it right. This only sends TO a stealth address.
Receiving to and managing a stealth address is a lot of work... and requires a lot of heavy lifting on the SPV server end...

My guess would be that banks think "they're not going to deposit large sums of money and they'll be withdrawing most of their balance every month anyways... so we can't use their money to gamble with" which to them has no merit.
Not to mention there is no demerit for banks to refuse someone service.

The blockchain already consists of over 20 different software forks, and yet all agree on one blockchain.
A software fork (aka a fork of the software) does not necessitate a fork on the blockchain, otherwise every core update would be a fork on the blockchain and we'd see much slower updates.
As long as the basic rules of the blockchain are agreed upon, there could be 50000000000 software forks, and it wouldn't matter.
If one version of the software caused a hard fork, but millions of other versions have more miners, the hard fork would barely even be noticed.
Heck, I could mine my own hard fork that says "starting from block x, difficult will be consistently the lowest possible" and "starting from block y the reward goes up to 500 BTC per block"
No one would mine it, as they know that if Bitcoin changed over to those rules people would sell all their bitcoins and lower the price.
So my fork will live as long as I run it, but any transaction I make based on bitcoins in my chain from the point of forking would not be accepted as valid by 99% of the network.
It's the fact that we have only about 20 implementations of the core protocol out there that one of them hard forking could cause havoc.
Read up about protocol diversity on bitcointalk dev discussion. Satoshi says some interesting stuff about it.

The index points used to generate each address are created sequentially using a hashing algorithm. Hashing algorithms "BY DEFINITION" must be unpredictable and non-associative when even ONE BIT is flipped. So hashing the byte "0x7F" and hashing the byte "0xFF" (so you changed one of the binary digits from 0 to 1) will generate a COMPLETELY different hash value.
So unless SHA256 (for Electrum) and/or SHA512 (for BIP32) can show relationships to two similar/close inputs. ie. 1 and 2 etc.......
AND Elliptic Curve math is shown to be able to associate two points added with associated points. (this is another added layer of security)
If BOTH of those things were true... then yes.
tl;dr No

Paper multisig doesn't exist, and won't ever, probably...
The closest thing would be using Shamir's Secure Secret Sharing algorithm to set it to a x out of y pieces to reassemble the private key.
However, I would recommend if you need to store large amounts, use Electrum offline signing with a separate device / bootable USB that contains the wallet etc.
But remember to make a backup plan for your backup plan.
aka, write down the seed on a piece of paper and store it safely... but also store the phrase somewhere safe and off-site. So if your house burns down your backup phrase won't go with it.
Edit: Also, whatever it is you do, TRY IT FIRST WITH SMALL AMOUNTS AND MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT THOROUGHLY BEFORE ACTUALLY PUTTING LARGE AMOUNTS IN IT.

If you would like to backup the old addresses, yes. You will need to manage your wallet backup files.
The new HD seed (the long string of words) only covers addresses derived from that seed, so any address existing BEFORE the HD wallet feature was added is not protected by the seed.
If you expect people to send you bitcoins to your old addresses in the future, definitely keep your backups... but from now on, all new keys made will be generated from the seed (and thus are backed up by the single seed phrase) so you will no longer need to update your backup file anymore.
If you don't expect payments to come to your old addresses anymore, I recommend only using addresses protected by the HD seed. As a string of English words is easier to backup in a way that doesn't rely on your phone not breaking etc. But definitely keep a copy of your old wallet backup somewhere just in case.

The new transaction fees for Bitcoin was from 0.0001 BTC (pre-2014) to 0.00001 BTC (post-early 2014)
Blockchain's app was designed during the 0.0001 BTC era, and at the time before Apple took their app down (and thus they were no longer able to update it) placing a 0.0005 BTC fee almost guaranteed you a spot in the next block (unless it was solved in less than 2 minutes after you sent the transaction)
Their UX design choice was also affected because the last update that they got in there had "disabled sending from the app" when in actuality it had a piece of code in it that would make the app appear to not send during Apple app review process, but would be able to send once it was released.
Apple didn't like this. That was the last update they had gotten in before they were taken off the store.
Also, for customer service, etc... Blockchain.info is consisting of 16 people who live all over the globe, and they get paid in bitcoins. Not to mention most of those 16 people are big names in the space, so they're always busy running around the conferences around the world.
They have tweeted recently that they will have a newly updated app for iOS soon, and the screen shot made me believe that they added the "Custom Send" feature where you can set your own fee.
The most I can say, is that blockchain.info is infinitely more secure than bitWallet.
Also, a good app is breadwallet. it uses BIP32 HD wallet. And it's insanely simple.

You're wrong.
If core dev put out a malicious release and someone noticed it, they would click a "fork" button on Github, then they would have control over their fork, revert the changes, and then plaster all over bitcoin talk, reddit, etc. "OMG THIS COMMIT IS MALICIOUS I MADE A NEW REPOSITORY HERE WITHOUT THE COMMIT IF YOU GUYS WANNA USE IT"
The programmers will see the mistake, and if they agree with him, start using his repository for updates instead.
The non-programmers will sit on the sidelines of discussion and watch. Deciding based on what they hear, and 70% of clients don't update at all, and skip a few updates periodically.
Aka, even if the NSA served the core dev team with a gag order and some unnoticeable sleeper code, we'd be fine...
As long as someone notices it.
Remember, Heartbleed bug was AMAZINGLY hard to catch, and looked like a simple slip of the keyboard........... Imagine if someone ENGINEERED the bug that way... Then imagine if they posed as a contributor and slipped something like that into Bitcoin.

I actually made an EC math module in VBA a while back... it was super slow... so I gave up on it.
I also found a SHA256 class for VBA, and attempted at coding a RIPEMD160 class as well... I got SHA256 working though. (it was mostly copy pasted from someone elses, and I modified it to accept binary inputs.
However, RIPEMD160 kinda sputtered out and I couldn't get it working.
So when I say it's possible, I know, I've coded it... except extremely poorly and inefficiently.
(edit: for reference, if you multiply the generator point by the order of the curve - 1 (the largest private key possible) it takes 120 seconds to perform the multiplication and give you the public key!!!!! (though I ran vigorous tests and it was 100% working... if not super slow.)

Your comment is the reason why Satoshi HAD to leave the project.
Bitcoin is not Satoshi's project. Just as a scientist who proposes a hypothesis does not OWN an experiment when thousands of people across the world are the ones doing the heavy lifting.
Satoshi was a smart man, but whether or not he typed some numbers on a keyboard or someone else did is irrelevant.

I think my mother's words to my father was "why would a normal person buy a $5,000 machine just to do what a 10 cent phone call could accomplish in seconds and a letter can do for postage, AND you can actually send THINGS with mail."
Let me talk best case scenario:
Everyone uses bitcoin, employers, as default, ask upon employment of how much % Bitcoin you want, and in what payment periods?
So say a guy takes his hourly salary in bitcoin that he just earned for his work the previous hour, and during lunch break, he decides to buy a sandwich.
He buys the sandwich, and his friend reminds him of the bet he lost the other day, so he sends that to his friend. Both actions only requiring a tap of their devices.
Everytime he uses his bitcoin through abcWallet, he gets miles for abc airlines, as they show him ads on his wallet.
Value is not a problem, as many people use bitcoins, so the value to the dollar is strictly regulated by the US government limiting their money production to mimic the deflationary properties of bitcoin.
The world flourishes, the end.
Now of course, that might not happen.
But you have to realize that if we told the current world situation in regards to email to someone in the 1990s, you would get the same reaction as my story above would get.

Yes. Yes it would be possible. In fact you could embed the BIP38 encrypted private key in a transaction funding the address itself.
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:04:35
BIP38 just does two things:
1. Takes digital security needs and coverts it to physical security needs. (The only reason this is considered "more secure" is because in general, people suck at digital security)
2. Adds a failsafe digital security measure that must be cleared AFTER the physical security has been breached. (So even if someone steals your BIP38 wallet out of your vault, fully knowing how to use it and what it is... they would still need the password)
However, there are 2 drawbacks that go hand in hand with the above:
1. You need to think of how to physically secure it. (Only one copy in your house? What if it gets stolen and you have no other copies? What if your house burns down? What if a flood comes and your BIP38 wallet gets wet? etc. etc.)
2. You need to remember your password. (What if you die? What if you get Alzheimer's? What if you mis-typed your password when you made the wallet? etc etc)
Soooo, if you have contingency plans for all possible mishaps and outcomes, THEN you are secure.
Final lesson: There is no one button solution for security for ANYTHING.

A pull request is basically "Hey guys, I have some code I want to add into Bitcoin. Could you please PULL it in there for me?"
If you get enough pull requests accepted, and you are proven to be a good contributor, then you can be eligible to become a "core developer" if circumstances allow, which basically means you have the right to add / change code at will (all in the open of course) and the ability to accept / reject others pull requests.

the transaction malleability problem was not a problem with Bitcoin itself. It was a problem with certain people's / companies' *implementations* of the protocol.
Most of these companies came around AFTER it was discovered, and they were ok (but they shut down temporarily just to check and make sure) but Gox was around since the early days, so they have been running their own version of Bitcoin since long before the issue was discovered, and their developers "skipped over that fix accidentally"... since no one utilized the bug in an attack, it went unnoticed.
This was 1 careless mistake that cost 1 company a TON OF MONEY as well as their customer's money to boot. So if you were to blame anyone, blame Mark for not keeping up with vital fixes to the protocol. It wasn't really "addressed," but once everyone freaked out, all the other exchanges came back with "nope, we were ok all along."
The 51% pool majority is not dependent on the implementation, it is a problem with the fundamental way the blockchain works.
It is because of this that changing the way the blockchain works without a clear and good reason could cause more harm than it would help deter.
To give an example, if I went and changed the way the fundamental internet structure is coded, and somehow rolled it out to all the major data centers, then all your home routers and consumer hardware would all of a sudden no longer be able to connect to the internet.
Similarly, if we were to alter the mining algorithm or add significant changes to prevent an attack from a majority holder, it would cause what is called a "hard fork."
A hard fork is when there are two conflicting sets of rules that create the blockchain. Anyone on an old version will see the chain of the new version as invalid, and the new version will see the chain of the old version as invalid, so there will be 2 Bitcoin chains, there will be no consensus as to who has what after the fork point and unless clients, merchants, and everyone hop on to one of the chains, there will be confusion and inevitably scammers who will use the two chains to scam people.
So we don't want a hard fork.
This is why it is hard to "just go ahead and fix it already" as some would suggest.
Not to mention that in network security, one of the best strategies is to hold an ace up your sleeve.
If Gavin posted a blog saying "here is how we will solve a 51% attack if it happens, here's the code everyone!" A malicious person intent on performing a 51% attack would see that and plan his attack around that fix.
So for now, the people not directly involved with development will discuss how they think they should fix it, and get scared, and the dev team already has a few aces up their sleeves depending on which vector they may attack from.

You're not ready for bitcoin and bitcoin is not ready for you.
Bitcoin needs to get to the point where people don't question it, like the current banking system.
A large piece of that puzzle is educating the youth. Another piece is getting people to associate bitcoins with old banks through centralized organizations akin to Circle and Coinbase.
Once it gets to that point where mom, dad, big brother, and kids are all using bitcoin, then you'll see average joe blindly believe bitcoin just like everyone blindly believes Goldmann Sachs into market crash after market crash.
Only difference will be that Bitcoin is written in code, whereas banking laws are written in crayon on napkins that the big banks use to wipe their ass.

They aren't mining in secret, they just mine the main chain and ignore a successful block, aka don't send it to the network, when it would put them over the 50% line.
Because all successful blocks go through the pool operator, they could easily code a kill switch to stop broadcasting successful blocks until someone else finds a block. Then their stopped successful blocks become invalid, and they tell the miners to start mining the new block someone else mined.
It's not only possible, I can almost guarantee that they do this. They would never let info like that leak though.

Of course your method will work. But let me quote OP.


This quote states:
1. Wipe Trezor
2. Set up with old phrase (from before wipe)
3. Enable passphrase (aka set a passphrase that is not "")
The assumption being "ok if I use a passphrase, can I access my bitcoins?" The answer being "No, because your HD seed is derived with the passphrase "" and therefore, setting any passphrase would generate an HD wallet with 0 balance.
Seeing his other post, I am aware he was able to solve his problem, but the answer to the question in 2 of "Will my bitcoins on a no-passphrase wallet be accessible from a wallet with a passphrase?" is "no." You will have to login with your new passphrase, copy an address, login with a blank passphrase, send it, then subsequently log in using only that passphrase.

OP isn't asking for a way to backup keys.
He is asking for a way to gain access to his keys without access to a Trezor device itself.
My point: The bitcoins exist regardless of Trezor, you just need to know the algorithms used to generate the addresses. One way to generate those addresses independently of Trezor is the site I forked, and another way is Wallet32.
No one said "You should totally have a copy of your Trezor backup seed in a Wallet32 app, because it's totally safe!"
I am merely calming OP's worries of "if my Trezor breaks, am I SOL until a replacement arrives?" (nervousness / fear of losing coins) by saying that Trezor is not necessary as long as you have your backup phrase.

Yes, and that was OK for the time, as there was much less riding on these wallets, and everyone was much less funded.
A company that gets millions in funding running on alpha level crypto should first think "ok we need to fund testing and moving to a more secure library / method. This should be rigorously tested on a testnet environment and then rolled out carefully"
Instead: "let's make the site look pretty and take 6 months to do that... Then when people complain about our service being wacky, let's implement changes in a couple days, run it through a short checklist, and roll it out to millions of users."
Though if we really want to get technical, native JS should not be used for key managing... There's no way to ensure secure deletion from memory, and a malicious MITM could serve you bad code and you wouldn't even know.

I understand that Trezor has sufficient entropy, and I only made this site for people asking me to translate my Japanese site... then some extra requests were thrown in, and I obliged.
But if someone was paranoid enough to want to generate their own entropy, then go ahead. &lt; this is my stance on the issue.
I know its overkill, but you might as well, if so inclined.

I personally know tons of people arbitraging GOX &lt;&gt; Bitstamp.
They see GOX soar, then buy up all the bitcoin they can afford on Bitstamp (raising price) and sell it on GOX (lowering price) until GOX and Bitstamp equalize.
This being added with the consistently rising price of GOX, pulled all the other exchanges up along with GOX.

Someone created 180 billion bitcoins in a block reward a couple years back.
1. Bitcointalk went apeshit.
2. Core dev put out a patch (Satoshi did, actually, as he was still around)
3. All nodes and miners upgraded (or at least MOST did.)
4. It was hard coded into the patch, just in case, to reject the block with that block id. (The offending block)
5. Everyone deleted all blocks after the block before that, and continued mining from there.
6. Everything calmed down within about an hour.
I would assume something similar would happen, but idk, maybe they've set up an emergency procedure or something.
Long story short, the blockchain would in affect "go down" for a short period.
Probably much shorter than some of the sites went down when Heartbleed was found.

BofA offers overdraft as default when you make an account, and I did disable it after the first time I got hit with their reordering scam.
After disabling overdraft protection, I could spend money minutes after a deposit, and it never came up as declined. The order was properly set in the order I ACTUALLY performed the spends in.
It is well documented that they default you into overdraft fees specifically so that they can reorder your transactions to hit you with as many overdraft fees as possible. When you disable overdraft, they don't re-order your transactions.
This is why I tell all my friends to disable overdraft protection.


Stay classy my friend.

It's keeping the coins young.
If coins sit in an address for too long, the number of bitcoin days destroyed when they move is large, and the spike will draw unwanted attention.
Though, just moving large amounts will draw a lot of attention which is why mixers / scripts usually keep things moving around in multiple transactions with small outputs.

Upon revisiting the chart, I realized the y axis is (/kilobyte), which lessened the "wtf" factor in my mind by a factor of 4.
For the most part, as I spend a lot of time doing consulting for startups here in Japan, I am spending &lt;40mBTC inputs split into one 1mBTC output and the remainder returning to myself with a 0.1mBTC fee. This is usually to test out new wallet clients and grab screen shots etc. (testnet availability is scarce)
Usually we are talking about 1mBTC inputs with turnarounds of &lt;5 minutes.
The transaction sizes are usually in the 200-300byte range. Which puts me in the 0.33mBTC - 0.5mBTC per kilobyte range on your graph.
My misunderstanding of the graph accounts for most of it, but I wonder. In measuring these fees, what did you consider "next block?"
If a tx was first propagated 2 seconds before the next block was propagated, obviously that tx had no time to get into mempools of miners in time, so it wouldn't seem right to say then "this tx took 2 blocks to confirm"
Was there a buffer between the tx receipt and the "next" block receipt being taken into account?

If you're looking for a 100% foolproof trustless (including not having to trust yourself) way to store bitcoins... then you're probably right. There is none right now.
If you are a serious investor, and can afford to spend money on securing your bitcoins, then put down $119 and buy a Trezor hardware wallet. That's probably the closest thing to foolproof as it gets currently.
If you are just looking for a way to store 0.01 bitcoins to spend within the next few months, then you don't need a super secure wallet. Something like breadwallet for iPhone or Mycelium for Android would be fine.
Again. My point is not to scare you away, but to let you know "there are so many things to consider with security, there's no 'one size fits all' secure storage method"

blockchain is implementing HD wallets, and while they're at it, they should either discourage (aka hide and make very difficult to) importing / exporting private keys.
I hope that BIP39 with BIP32 will help the "I lost / got my backup hacked" type problems...
But if they allow for everything to be exported willy nilly, I can just see the next wave of "omg I saved my xpub Master Public Key and one of my exported private keys from my wallet on a draft in Gmail and now all my bitcoins are gone!"
Then blockchain.info's customer service will have to come and do damage control again.
No wallet is perfect, but they need to forsee and discourage bad security practices, both internal development-wise and externally by forseeing the most mistake prone customer when designing the product. (Seriously, generating a new address, you should not display the address on the page until AFTER the "sync succeeded" check is complete. If the sync fails, it should not even display the address.)

That is why you only put as much money as you wouldn't kill yourself for losing in your wallet and only use trusted wallets.

Mycelium's entire business model is based off of the trust and good will of the community. Their incentives are aligned to be good, so I trust them with my $20-30 that I may hold at any given time.

"The Blockchain network works equally well..."
If by "work" you mean "functions" then yes.
However, a blockchain "functioning" at a low difficulty will be very insecure. (as is evidence by every altcoin that has ever been 51% attacked)
The more each bitcoin is worth, the more money a miner can rationalize spending on electricity and hardware to mine... thus increasing the difficulty and increasing the cost and difficulty to attack the network with a concentrated 51% attack by a single bad actor.
The lower bitcoin's price is, the more miners pull out. Lowering the difficulty and lowering the cost to 51% attack the network.
If a permanent solution is found for the 51% attack, **then** your student would be right about "a high price is not necessary for the network function"
But then I would say "so what? it's a free market. If you want cheaper bitcoins, then dump a ton of them on the market and crash it... oh wait, you don't have any? Then buy up a ton and spike the market through the roof first."

Think of all data as a numbers.
1 byte of data has up to 256 possibilities, so think of it as a number from 1-256.
The bitcoin address is 25 bytes of data.
256 possibilities multiplied by itself 25 times (this is how you calculate number of possible outcomes)
The number of possibilities is a number starting with 1 and has 60 zeroes on it... That's a lot of possibilities.
So we could just use numbers 0-9 for bitcoin addresses... But who wants to copy a 61 digit number?
Well, we could use more types of digits, like the alphabet, maybe some symbols...
Bitcoin addresses have 58 possibilities for each digit, which is why the size shrunk down to 34 characters.
If you had a list of every word in the English language, maybe you could relay that much info in a few words?
Anywho, that's why they're so long.

That's not the fault of Bitcoin.
Paypal etc. have a company to willfully hide the wait times from you under the assumption that it goes well.
Trezor is giving users a poor UX by deciding NOT to hide the wait time from you.
If you are going to place the fault on anyone, it's Trezor for creating a poor user experience.
In Bitcoin, since there's no central company, you have a lot of startups that are started by tech guys who love to talk about internals and specifics. This is why they show the user all the internals.
To us tech guys, it's "OMG LOOK HOW COOL BITCOIN IS! IT CAN DO WHAT CREDIT CARDS TAKE MONTHS AND DO IT IN 30 MIN TO AN HOUR OMGOMGOMG *nerdgasm*" but to the normal user it's "huh? Credit cards are just one swipe and I'm done. what are you talking about?"
I understand your frustration. But please don't place it on a problem with Bitcoin. It's really a user experience design problem for Trezor's service.
To give a contrary example. I just went to the humble bundle's humble store. No account sign up or anything. Clicked buy with bitcoin for an indie PC game, was asked for an e-mail address, a QR code was shown, I scanned it, tapped "Pay" on my phone, and the website registered it within 2 seconds, and e-mailed me the game key instantly. I started downloading in seconds. Only info given to humble bundle was my e-mail.
In Bitcoin, the user experience is 100% reliant on the company in charge of payment processing. Trezor do their own. Humble bundle also do their own (I think... or at least it didn't send me to any payment page etc and was very "integrated")
Edit: PS, it was this game  I highly recommend it. A lot of inside jokes for any video game programmers out there.

"Add your private key, a random number, and the transaction hash into a big mathematical pot. Send that pot, and an encoded version of the random number to the person who needs to verify."
ELI5 verifying
"Add their public key, the encoded random number, and the pot together into a different mathematical pot, and if the encoded random number comes out as a result, the public key matches the signature, hooray!"

Here's an idea:
Write up an explanation of Bitcoin in as much technical detail as you understand.
Then post it here to reddit and we'll see if you have any misconceptions at all / give suggestions on what to gloss over / how to simplify some parts.
My opinion on what other videos are lacking is practical use situations.
Every video explains Bitcoin using a gradient of confusing to over-simplistic metaphors/analogies, yet NO videos show an actual transaction. Click link on bitpay payment page, the amount is already filled for you, click send, enter password if have one, done. 
I know a lot of people don't understand the why, but after explaining the why, no one explains the hows. How do I get bitcoin? How do I use Bitcoin? etc.

I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what the target means.
If there are 5 cups, and under only one of the cups is an m&amp;m, and it takes me 2 seconds to lift a cup, and 4 seconds to lift a cup then eat an m&amp;m..... then let's say that as soon as I lift a cup, five more new cups are transported below me, so I can never eliminate cups from my guessing... you could say "I will eat a new m&amp;m on average every 12 seconds."
However, this has nothing to do with time, and everything to do with probability.
If we attempted to use your model, where payout is = the difficulty. What's to stop me from saying "OK, I am ok with a 1 satoshi reward or even no reward, so I'm going to solve a block in 3 seconds with my pocket calculator and double spend a 5,000 bitcoin transaction!"
The incentive model doesn't work without a set probability.
A set probability means a set time.
If we didn't retarget, you'd get the a similar problem... as ASICs get faster and faster, block times will tend towards 0 seconds. clogging the network with 0 transaction blocks left and right. Orphans would happen all the time, and the system would not be able to gain consensus on which blockchain is the longest because everyone would make so many blocks all at the same time... end of chain insecurity would probably lead to 10-20 block chains getting orphaned almost everyday.
I understand that you probably only had a basic understanding of Bitcoin and decided to post a "what if" topic. But unfortunately, the example you gave could not work.
Now, looking at other altcoins, we know that 2 minute targets, 1 minute targets etc. are possible. However, in those chains, orphans are more common... end of chain security is much less stable, etc.
For a while, there was debate on whether 10 was too short, but luckily the mining power filled out quite nicely to create a nice even probability distribution.
Maybe in the future we could lower the blocktimes, but for right now we're seeing astronomical growth in mining power, and most of the time at retarget we see 6-7 minute blocks. So if we lowered the target now, we'd have orphaning problems, low transaction counts in blocks (I mean MUCH lower than now... and they're pretty low already)
If you know of any altcoins with better target times and some benefits / disadvantages they experience, I'd love to hear about them. I'm not too into altcoins myself.

No, that's not what I mean.
He implemented BIP39 after it had already been set in stone (post-Trezor) and literally, the current implementation (git head) generates 13 word BIP39 phrases (not using the old-Electrum method) that will be incompatible with any BIP39 implementation that checks for the validity of the phrase. (if the implementation only runs it through the key derivation function without checking, it will be compatible though)
He said in the chat a while back that "compatibility with other wallets doesn't concern me" and I agree with him.
The old Electrum mnemonic code is in there so that old seeds can still be used on newer versions. From 2.0 on the only seeds generated by Electrum will use the BIP39 method with a twist (13 words) and contain many word lists for many languages.

By revealing the PUBKEY HASH. Not by revealing the public key.
Public Key is NOT EQUAL to the Pubkey Hash.
If all you have done is sent TO an address, a hacker would need to break RIPEMD160 hashing algorithm, SHA256 hashing algorithm, AND the Elliptic Curve SECP256K1 curve function.
If you have spent FROM the address (or publicly signed any messages FROM that address, as Bitcoin message signatures reveal the public key) the attacker now knows your public key, and ONLY needs to crack the Elliptic Curve SECP256K1 function.

No hostility. I was just supporting the opposing claim. That tends to come off as "attacking" unless you take measures to ensure to use fluffy language and round about euphemisms, which I did not.
That being said, the two points I gathered from this reply along with your mention of the "heirs" thing:
1. checksum was only really put into the BIP to allow wallet providers to check if the user wrote them down in the wrong order. The list suggestions also say "the first 4 letters should be unique" which is to help auto-correction implementation on wallet side. Think of the checksum as just an optional helper for "order correction"
2. For your use case, you would still need to manage two BIP39 phrases anyways. (one for your main account and one for your sub account) So if you want to stay standard, just manage your accounts separately to begin with, i.e. with separate root seeds to begin with. I understand the "utility" of your idea sounds better and more easy and simple, but in the end, it would still require a wallet developer to make a UI function that can handle importing sub-wallets from other wallets using mnemonics... or in my suggestion, a function to manage two mnemonic wallets on the same wallet. 
However, you can always generate an xprv key for the sub-account with the BIPs we have now if you must have this functionality. But like I said, no wallets support this. (in fact only a few wallets support BIP39 to begin with)
This is not being snotty or anything, but if you think that methodology for detatching sub-accounts as mnemonics and being able to import sub-accounts via those mnemonics, that actually sounds like a good idea for a new BIP. But BIP39 is not about HD wallets at all, so any suggestion to add such a functionality to it will be rejected. (I follow the guys who manage BIP39, and have a good idea of what they will reject, and a lot of rejections are for ideas that stem from "HD wallet functionality enhancement". They are "a methodology of generating a non-reversible seed from entropy that is human memorable")

It's pretty easy to explain:
A public key is your private key times the generator point, "G"
So (lower case is private, upper case is public, G is generator point)
d * P = p * D
Is easier to understand as
d * p * G = p * d * G

Yes all.
The situation you described is a situation where Node A and node B disagree on whether or not transactiion A is a valid (ie high enough priority / fits the rules of their client) transaction or not.
When you send a no fee transaction. 90% of the network completely refuses to relay / store your transaction. Block explorers like blockchain.info etc. loosen the transaction relay parameters so it can see more transactions, but in actuality, only a small percentage of nodes stores your transaction in their mempool.
Because of this, if I sent a transaction with a proper fee that fit the rules of 100% of the network, that double spend transaction will propagate to over 90% of the network, and the nodes that DID accept my first transaction will REJECT the second transaction OUTRIGHT. Like literally they will see it and refuse to pass it along.
However, because 90% of the network refused my first transaction. there is a much higher probability that the double spend transaction with the proper fee will be accepted into a block, as more miners will be likely to have it.
So the fact is, if a node SEES AND ACCEPTS a transaction with input A, then SEES another transaction using input A after that... that node will NOT relay the transaction and NOT store it in their mempool.
What you are explaining is using other methods to prevent transactions from being propagated, but it doesn't change the fact that nodes have anti-double spending functionality built into them
Your OP basically insinuates that Bitcoin nodes are allowing double spends willy nilly, which is NOT true.
Whether or not it is effective or not is a separate issue.
I am merely saying your solution is no better than the current method of anti-double spending already implemented.

Notice how this message being signed does not have any signatures in it. For each input, you place the output scriptpubkeys from each referred tx into the transaction when signing.
Then you take the exact same message above and sign it with each input's private key, and that gives you the scriptsigs you see:

If you start down that road, then it must be mentioned that 160 bits of entropy is the maximum for a Bitcoin address's entropy.
Using electrum's mnemonic system, you can represent that with 15 words.
The reasoning behind choosing 12 words instead of 15 was that it would be easier to memorize, and that the key stretching algorithm would help protect against brute forcing.
Letting users choose their own passwords is basically a brainwallet, and we know why those are bad.
Forcing users to use electrum words and then allowing them to use extra words would defeat the purpose of creating the mnemonic anyways.
I think the devil's advocate stance is less on Electrum security and more on Bitcoin security in general, because 1626^12 entropy with key stretching is pretty darn close to the cap.

Sending money to my country in fiat: flat fee of $50USD equivalent regardless of amount. Plus crappy exchange rate from bank, last time I went they had the rate on a %5 markup. Then they charge a %3 charge on the amount before removing the $50 fee.
Bitcoin, I get charged a %1 fee plus bank fee of 0.5%, no mentionable markups on rate.
Back to fiat in my country it's usually %5 over the current rate.
This is usually finished in 2-3 minutes.
When I buy stuff online, I get around %3 discounts or so using bitcoin, then I get charge 1.5% for buying back the same amount of bitcoin at the same time.
The "replenish as soon as you use" technique is good for the bitcoin market, as services like bitpay sell BTC immediately, slighty lowering the price, and I buy the same amount slighty raising the price... and is good for me. If I didn't buy it back I'd have to get my bitcoin back again eventually, so why not now?

What if they sent it from cold storage? (ie. a paper wallet)
What if they spent all the cold storage up, so they threw away the paper wallet?
What if they sent from a hosted service like Coinbase? What if they sent out 8 users' different bitcoins out all in one transaction?
What if they sent it through a mixer?
You never know. So don't send back to the address that sent to you unless you KNOW FOR A FACT that the user has control of the keys.
Example: The other day, I set up a friend with breadwallet app, and he wrote down his phrase. I sent him some coins.
The following week he had gone to a bar just started accepting bitcoins and asked to buy him a drink... so I sent to the same address in the history, as I knew he had access to it.
@_date: 2014-11-30 05:16:22
It seems like maybe blockchain doesn't handle large sized transactions well? I ran the numbers, and if the user had 341 utxos in his wallet to use, slapping them all into a transaction would result in a roughly 62 kb transaction...
Of course, I don't know the addresses so I'm just guessing, but that might be a hint to solving the issue just FYI.
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:16:58
Food for thought:
1. If there was a solution that could be open sourced that knowing the solution would not help an attacker avoid it, then we wouldn't be in this mess. We need to think of one of these.
2. There are plenty of solutions that are kept behind closed doors, that rely on the attacker not knowing how we will counter act. These solutions are more temporary, but also serve to make the attacker waste resources.
3. Any change to the mining algorithm that greatly affects profitability would never be adopted by the miners. All changes to Bitcoin that require a hard-fork MUST BE ADOPTED BY THE MINERS TO WORK, otherwise we have a hard fork, and everyone reverts back to the old version so they don't get stuck mining a useless fork.
4. It is because of this, that even if we had a  solution or many  solutions... the only time we could conceivably implement such a feature (unless we found a miraculous way to prevent 51% attack without hard forking and/or affecting miner profits.) is DURING A 51% ATTACK. Think about it. Nothings happening "hey, want to upgrade to this version that gives you less money?" &lt; "NO"... Then imagine all hell is breaking loose and 51% attacker is destroying the blockchain. Gavin rolls out one of the ready-made fixes. Miners think "mine worthless bitcoin (51% attack succeeds), or mine bitcoin with worth (51% is thwarted)" and decide to upgrade.
It's very similar to the tactics used in Presidential Elections in the USA. OMG WERE AT WAR WITH IRAQ YOU MUST ELECT ME FOR ANOTHER TERM OR ELSE TERRORISTS!

Yes, with one minor fix.


The tx isn't pushed to the stack, the signature of it is.
Basically the input for a basic pay to pubkey hash is like so:
    &lt;DER encoded signature&gt; &lt;pubkey&gt;
The output is this:
    &lt;OP_DUP&gt; &lt;OP_HASH160&gt; &lt;20BytePubkeyHash&gt; &lt;OP_EQUALVERIFY&gt; &lt;OP_CHECKSIG&gt;
There's also a less used format:
    output: &lt;pubkey&gt; &lt;OP_CHECKSIG&gt;

though you would be right for something like bitWallet, which lets you generate addresses on the chain at will (it doesn't use gap limit at all), most of the more recent apps only show you one address, the youngest address with no history.
But still, gap limit is a good point too. Nice catch.
BIP44 also tries to address that as well.
@_date: 2014-02-03 12:35:42
Nope. Electrum wouldn't let him send the transaction unless his unused inputs to all of his addresses added up to over 0.3 BTC.
If he had 0.4 at time of sending and as you theorize 0.3 BTC came in afterward, electrum wouldn't have been able to include that input into the transaction and sign it in time to broadcast to the network.
A transaction fee is the gap between inputs total BTC and outputs total BTC. When writing a transaction in raw code, the way you decide your fee is by setting the total of your outputs to be less the total inputs by the amount you wish to send as a fee.
If you look at the transaction window, it shows 1 input. That input was good for 0.7BTC, and the way I know that is that the outputs only add up to 0.4 BTC and the fee says 0.3
most likely it was one of those brain fart moments when you put too many sugar cubes in your coffee because you're zoning out or something.
There should really be a safety measure before sending. When you type your password, it just broadcasts... so a little bit unsafe... They should have a confirmation message at least.

It has become sort of a joke at my workplace.
Some of the jokes: A super rude customer? "Hey, how about you refund him in Bitcoin, maybe he'll like that, lol." etc.
It doesn't seem hostile, and it doesn't seem like they're directly attacking me... but when I start talking about it, they do have an air of *rolls eyes* HERE WE GO AGAIN.
However, I have run with the joke, and even brought Bitcoin up in similar fashions. The joke being "omg lol it must be useless amirite guys?"
The catch is I pepper it with "wait, what?" type comments.
Like "haha dude we should totally pay JUST OUR BOSS's bonus in Bitcoin... then he wouldn't be able to buy much... except reserving a hotel through expedia since yesterday." (After the expedia announce)
This strategy of constantly bring it up as a joke and peppering it with the latest merchant acceptance info / VC funding info in a psuedo-negative light has lead to an almost steady flow of people asking be privately after the fact about Bitcoin in a serious manner. I have gotten 25 people in my office to come to a meetup and 5 of them are now regulars.

Basically, here's the method.
Method 1: Bank of America to Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ Bank using international SWIFT transfer.
This gives me 108108 yen for 1000 USD. (Google currently states 114085)
The closest table near the bottom: 1500 yen flat + 0.05% (minimum 2500 yen) which comes out to 4000 yen fee just for accepting overseas transfer. (this leaves me with 104108 yen in my account)
Method 2: BofA &gt; Circle &gt; BTCBox &gt; MUFJ
1,000 USD becomes 2.64557263 BTC instantly from bank.
Sell 2.64 BTC on BTCBox  for 111165 JPY and get a little over 110500 in my bank account.
Difference of about 6400 JPY. This was all calculated with the rate just now (as I write this post)
My actual amounts for the two transfers were 1000 -&gt; 102740 with Banks, 1000 -&gt; 112460 with BTC.
Caveats: I had a history with Circle so I have more instant than most people. Also, I happened to have funds on BTCBox so waiting for confirmations was not an issue... it literally all took about 5 minutes for both processes... but BTC was deposit next day (mostly BTCBox waiting) and Banks was almost a week.

First of all: one private key always comes out to the SAME public key if given the same curve and the same implementation of said curve. (ie. bitcoin chooses a specific curve and a specific implementation, and everyone must make their keypairs off of that same curve and implementation)
As long as the random number generator is valid, the attacker could have any number of your signatures and they would be so random that the attacker would not be any closer to cracking the private key.

Early Adopters is a myth that late innovators make up to convince early adopters to sell.
Think of it this way:
When Bitcoin hit $1, there were tons of people saying "We're late for the early adopter train, how did you guys know that it would get this big!?" and that sends a message to others that creates an air of "This is as good as it gets."
This causes FUD amongst the Early Adopters who will then try to take profit, and the people who were supposedly early innovators (the step after early adopters) buy up the coins, knowing that they are still early adopters.
We're definitely nearing the end of the Early Adopters phase. But until you see mainstream adoption increase, we're not even close. Even with a good size mainstream adoption, some things fail. The "tipping point" everyone speculates about will only come once we've got kids receiving their allowances in bitcoins and parental control wallets with online syncing of blah blah and everyone's flying around in cars etc. (jk)

tbh, the only way for mass adoption to happen is centralized services that are insured / protected, OR "the masses" learn about everything you just described.
The latter is not am impossible feat, but the former will probably push adoption before the latter has a chance to gain holding with "the masses"
Remember, there's less than maybe a million people using Bitcoin, which are primarily people with at least a will to learn about tech.

However, any sustained long hard fork would completely destroy bitcoin's credibility, so the above is strictly hypothetical, and in reality, miners will ALWAYS try to maintain one chain. Majority of mining power wins.

Basically, when you and I make a multisig, I generate a keypair and so do you, you and I share with each other our public keys. and generate a script (fancy word for encoded message) that says "2 of 2 multisig using public keys ABC and XYZ" (which by the way it is standard to always order the public keys in this script in a specific order. least to greatest value I think)
Then you sha256 &gt; ripemd160 hash that script, slap a 0x05 version byte on it instead of the normal 0x00 version byte (this is to denote pay-to-script-hash, which is currently most widely used as multisig)
So as long as you keep the private keys private, all you need to do is share public keys. Apps like copay actually have you share master public keys with each other so you all can generate each other's public keys whenever you want, and say "hey Mr.X I just generated multi-sig  on our chain... could you sign it for me?" and his program will say "Ok, let me look for  on my Master PRIVATE key chain, here it is, and now I'll sign that transaction for you, mate!" etc.

Ok I see where you're getting confused.
The ScriptSig is the section of the input that is used to verify that the person who signed the transaction actually signed it.
I think you are confused because you are not understanding who is signing.
The user signs the transaction. This signature is represented as some loooong hex numbers. Those hex numbers are then placed in the scriptsig along with the signer's public key.
1. User signs transaction.
2. **After** signing the transaction, the user places the resulting **signature** into the Scriptsig.
3. **After** placing the signature. The user then places his Public Key in the ScriptSig, so that anyone verifying the signature from  can know the public key, which is used for **verifying** the signature.
4. Another user receives the signed transaction, and verifies the signature from  by using the public key from  to verify it.
So the **private** key is used to **sign** transactions. And the **public** key is used to **verify** the signature.
The ScriptSig contains the public key ONLY so that people who receive the transaction can VERIFY the signature.

If you don't know about binary hex strings, your 20 bytes hash is probably NOT associated with your private key. (ie, you probably hashed your pubkey STRING and not your pubkey BINARY HEX STRING.

The password will generate a separate wallet.
To visualize, the phrase "ball back butter" with no password will generate the first address of 1ABC, but the phrase "ball back butter" with the password "a" will generate the first address of 1uEa.
You are not password protecting the wallet a la encryption. You are "salting" the wallet, so that a criminal could figure out your seed and it will generate a valid wallet (which you can send dummy funds to) and unless he knows your password he won't be able to find your REAL wallet.
 is pretty much all you can do... Also you don't need to use new recovery words, just the same recovery words, but this time "recover" with the password you want to use. (every password will generate a separate wallet) Then send the coins to THAT wallet.

If you mean why 1 and not 2 etc., then the answer is:
Just because that's what they chose. When you make your own altcoin, you can choose whatever number or letter you want as long as it is base58.
If you mean why have a version byte to begin with, then the answer is:
It allows for differentiation of address types. Without it, there would be no way to tell between a pubkey hash and a privkey hash. It also allows for new types like the 3 p2sh addresses.
It also fights confusion amongst altcoins, as each coin tends to choose new bytes to head their addresses, so you don't accidentally send the wrong coin and effectively throw away your coin.

The likelyhood of finding a high-entropy private key just randomly is insane. Either way, that is not what I'm talking about.
Randomly checking private keys and randomly checking brainwallets is different, and much easier. Why? Because people choose dumb passwords.
In order to get a Brainwallet to be secure enough, you must make such a long and non-rememberable password that you'll have to write it down... which then defeats the purpose. You could write a HD wallet seed with less pen ink.
BIP38 does NOT DERIVE KEYS, it takes an ALREADY GENERATED PRIVATE KEY and it protects it with a password.
Let's say you chose a Brainwallet that was "password" and I generated a high entropy private key, and then encrypted it using BIP38 with the same "password" password.
1. Your bitcoins would be gone in 0.0000000001 second, because people know the brainwallet for password, and millions of other easy passwords, and check it like a hawk... not only that, but they are constantly checking new passwords that they notice online or when some site leaks tons of passwords on the black market... they test every password they see, and unless you have a REALLY good one. There's NOTHING stopping someone from taking your coins.
2. With BIP38, I can generate a secure random private key (without some password, just using coinflips or something if I want) and run it through BIP38 encryption. I can shut it in a bank vault, and no one would be able to get at it... but EVEN IF THEY DID. And if they decided to try "password" as the first try... the SAME COMPUTER that took 0.0000000001 second to perform the single SHA256 necessary to generate a brainwallet would take 2 seconds to run through the 16384 iterations of Scrypt. If I had a slightly good password that isn't on the most common passwords list, the amount of time it would take them to guess enough passwords to find mine is ASTRONOMICALLY longer than to just guess a brainwallet and check it.
You honestly need to read up on what BIP38 ACTUALLY IS and not just what your head tells you.
Also, try developing your own wallet that uses both, and tell me when you've got 16384 iterations of Scrypt running faster than a single SHA256, and I'll eat a hat.

But to be honest. There is one BIG factor in Bitcoin security that you can not objectively judge, and no one can judge FOR you.
Do you trust YOURSELF?
What I mean by this, is that the method I described also answers the question "How to I store bitcoins in a way that 100% relies solely on myself and no one else can possibly come in an steal my coins?"
Bitcoin security is a sliding scale from placing the burden on yourself or others. It's also a binary choice of physical security or digital security.
If you are 100% sure that you can securely store keys offline in MULTIPLE physical locations and are able to trust that you can recover them... THEN that is the safest method.
However, if you are a clutz and you are forgetful, and you are bad with storing things properly etc. Then this would be a VERY VERY BAD way to store Bitcoins.
You will have to research on your own. I'm sorry.
@_date: 2014-11-30 08:33:47
Exactly, thus the disclaimer.
You won't need to calculate shit, but if you visit a lot of faucets and wonder why your fee that you always pay all of a sudden jumped from 0.0001 BTC to 0.0062 BTC... this tutorial will help you understand why. (because your transaction was 62 kb)
Also, I find that some people use blockchain.info's "custom send" feature that allows you to set your own fee (aka it does 0 calculations for you) and on many occasions their transaction gets in limbo because they set the fee to 0.00001 and it turned out their tx was a few kb large...
I personally think all apps (even blockchain.info's custom send) should display how many bytes the transaction will be if it goes above 1,000 bytes imo... that way people know "the same old fee is not good enough for your transaction."
However, if you have up to 5 inputs and are only sending to 1 person, then you'll be under 1000 bytes and fees are pretty much flat.
In traditional banking fees are reliant on the amount of money sent, in bitcoin it's reliant on the amount of data stored on the blockchain.

That assumes a stockpile of bitcoins that the company holds. If the company paid out in bitcoins from this stockpile, capital gains would be realized.
However, if they buy the bitcoins newly at the point of every payment to their employees, or go through a payment processor, they could report their taxes as LIFO and no capital gains would be realized, as the price would be the same as time of payment.
But in reality, a payment processor would be better logistically. Seeing as almost no companies stockpile bitcoins currently.

I think what you're getting at is "how do you know which to sign with first?" Or something along those lines of misunderstanding the signing process. Probably under the wrong assumption you must include the sigs in the data to be signed or something.
You sign everything except the signatures and you include the scriptpubkey for each input. You sign the exact same data with all private keys, then you insert each signature after all signing is done.

You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding how bitcoin works.
Sending bitcoin is like putting bitcoin in a locker with a complicated math puzzle on it. Only the person with the solution to the puzzle can open it and send the funds.
Just because you keep the solution to the puzzle offline does not mean you can't copy down the puzzle itself and give it to other people so they can find your locker.
Edit: because the locker is on the blockchain, there's no need to tell the blockchain to make a new locker. Every locker that can ever possibly exist already exists.

People who don't trade forex don't understand this fact.
To make it simple, imagine Alice and Bob are both using Circle at the exact same millisecond, Alice buys $1,000 in bitcoins, and Bob sells $1,000 worth of bitcoins.
They will sell Alice her bitcoins at $460 and buy Bob's bitcoins at $440. The actual price that they buy and sell these bitcoins on the exchanges is $450.
2.22222222 BTC is how much they buy / sell in bitcoins on the backend. (if they were smart, they would just give the bitcoins they had on the service from Bob to Alice without them knowing)
However, Alice gets 2.17391304 BTC, and Bob loses 2.27272727 BTC from his account.
So for Alice's transaction, they gained 0.04830918 BTC, and with Bob's transaction they gained 0.05050505 BTC.
Total gain for Cirlcle 0.09881423 BTC, at $450 is $44.47.
$2,000 transacted by Alice and Bob, Circle sees $44.47 in gain which would average out to a 2.2% "fee"... but remember, Coinbase and others include this "fee" on top of the actual fees that they show you.
Because bitcoins are volatile, and at the same time low liquidity... it's difficult to keep a spread (the pseudo "fee" I explained above) low. I would imagine a 2-3% spread would be very reasonable.

If you have the ability to spend a customer's bitcoin holdings. (aka you "hold the keys" ala Coinbase, MtGox etc.)
You must:
1. Submit to public audits conducted by a 3rd party every quarter.
2. Hold 100% of the customer's balance in bitcoin. If you hold 4 BTC on customer's account balances, you must HAVE 4BTC. (As unlike USD, we can't print more)
3. Designate an Chief IT Security Officer (CSO) that must participate in a security commission of all players in the industry. In that commission there must be a set of IT security practices set as rules. Everyone must follow those rules.
Sites like blockchain.info, Greenaddress.it, etc etc. ie. wallet SERVICE that DOESN'T hold user funds must:
1. create a failsafe system to allow the user to recover their funds from the information provided to the user. (This would be like blockchain.info's Decrypt Wallet tool or Greenaddress's nTimeLock)
2. create a how-to manual on how to recover funds in the event of service ending.
3. Must notify user of any information that can not be later recovered. (a seed that is only shown once, etc.) With the explicit phrasing of "this information is vital to recovery of funds and will not be displayed again. Please write it down."
Open source projects:
1. exempt to all regulation.
2. User beware situation. Personal responsibility required.
Closed source non-service based projects:
1. considered as viruses/malware (even if benevolent)
2. all local laws pertaining to distributing malware/viruses in the region are applicable.

Sorry, I don't trust a service that has tons of new shill one day accounts on every post it makes upvoting it. Then it makes a post trying to diss a competitor, and the same quality of English speaking one day shill accounts pop up "defending" their competitor, promptly followed by a post from them pointing out "omg our competitor is hiring shills!!! Omg!!!"
Notice how your competitor never bothers to come out and point out your blatant use of shills. This is because they don't care if you use dirty tricks, they just code a kickass service.
Anyone with half a brain can see through you. So if you want to make a successful service, or scam, or whatever it is you're doing... You should put out or stfu and come back when you have a product ready.
Nothing wrong with promoting ahead of time to generate hype, but hiring shills and then attacking your competitors is low, man.

1. date and price of coin recorded by wallet.
2. buy-back after purchase. (They cancel each other out tax-wise, but just in case, the wallet has the dates and everything.)
3. calculating capital gains when everything is in CSV format in one place? easy. calculating all the deductables from cash spent when you forget to file the receipts properly / trying to get CSV data from your online bank that is older than a few months requires calling the bank etc.)
Not being a blind bitcoin pumper or anything, but having paid taxes on a normal paycheck (and still doing so fyi) and also having paid taxes on capital gains for bitcoins, my personal experience was that bitcoins were easier to report because all the data was in one place, backed up online, and easily accessible. Whereas fiat stuff relies heavily on "keeping receipts in a folder somewhere" when I use cash etc.
I guess you could make the argument that it's adding another step, regardless of how easy that step is, which means adding on to the workload of filing taxes, to which I say "you're right" but really, it's not that complicated. Definitely not deserving of all the over-exaggerating people do around here.

Everyone is used to their own monetary unit, when you move to a new country, it takes time to get used to a new monetary unit.
You are just trying to make bitcoin fit your monetary unit's numerical tendencies without considering anything other than "well people won't like it because it's not like their money." and use the word "people" interchangeably with "people who use the same currency I do."
I live in Japan, where a Big Mac Meal is 595 yen. I don't think "OMG I AM PAYING LIKE $500 FOR EVERY MEAL OMG!" every time I buy a Big Mac.
I also lived in South Korea for a while, and there it costs like 6,000 won to buy a Big Mac Meal. I did not automatically think "OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG I AM SPENDING SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH OMGOMGOMGOMG!"
People get used to it. You need to take away all this "unit bias as it pertains to MY currency" BS and only concentrate on objective reasons for why a unit should be chosen. If you want to use unit bias as an objective reason, look at something to measure it objectively. Not just "what if someone wants 10 bucks and they have to get 20,000 bits omg big numbers omg." I do not find 20,000 to be a big number, nor do I find it hard to deal with. Therefore we can conclude your statement is not objective.

It costs less time to send a 0 transaction block around the network due to small bytesize.
If they add 1000 transactions it'll take a few extra seconds per peer degree they send to.
Imagine me sending you a 1kb file and then sending you a 4 MB file. Then imagine you had to send that to someone else, and so on... the time difference after 4-5 passes will be fairly large.
The difference between being properly propagated and being orphaned is 25 BTC or 0 BTC.

576 BTC is if your transaction is exactly 1000 bytes AND the 576 BTC you used was only confirmed just in the last block.
What I mean to say is that if you send 576 BTC or more AND you follow the other rules of a no fee transaction, you could literally send 576 BTC back and forth EVERY BLOCK and never pay a fee, not once. AND your transaction will be prioritized every time.
However, if your transaction is 500 bytes, you only need half of that, or 288 BTC. If your transaction is 250 bytes, 144 BTC... Etc etc
Also, if you wait blocks, it gets lower.
Assuming 250 byte transaction, 144 BTC to send back and forth every block. 72 BTC to send back and forth every 2 blocks. 36 BTC to send back and forth every 4 blocks, so on and so on.
Eventually, it works out to 1 BTC can be sent every 144 blocks (about 1 day) for free.
If it's 0.1 BTC, then ten days, etc etc.

Take a hash of your biometric identifying data, palm veins etc. and use that as the private key.
No one is saying "I'm gonna solve the voting problem with the blockchain."
They're just saying "The blockchain solves distributed trust over a network, so it could be used to solve the voting problem."
However there is one huge problem.
You need trust in the government to decide who is a citizen and who is not. Who is eligible to vote and who is not, etc.
Until every citizen has a private key to which the public key is registered for voting, it won't get solved. Even then, the highly trust-based model of sovereignty is prone to corruption.
You would have to create an entire country out of a blockchain for 100% trustless voting.
However, having the govt allow revistering one and only one public key per person with their databases, and then using that private key to vote would greatly decrease voting fraud. I believe this is what people are talking about.

Those lowered fees were included in 0.9.0... Just to give you an idea, it took several months after the release of 0.9.0 for more than 50% of nodes to upgrade.
During that time, you had to gamble on whether to use the old fees or new fees. An old node would reject your transaction, but a new node would relay it.
If a rogue dev added malicious code to the codebase, it would be spotted and people would be all over reddit and bitcointalk telling people not to upgrade.
The network would chug along without upgrading, and the core dev team would need to either remove the commit, or risk bitcoin/bitcoin no longer being the place to get bitcoin updates.

All a thief needs is:
1. Your master public key.
2. Any one private key from any address derived FROM the Master public key in 
The math is very simple.
Single private key - index scalar = Master Private Key (mod N)
Then bam, the attacker has all your private keys.
This is the singular weakness of deterministic wallets.
But you should be keeping private keys private anyways. If you MUST export a private key, generate a separate private key and send the bitcoins you need to that address.

You are confusing "regulation" with "rules."
Bitcoin has rules, and we love these rules. They are like "2 + 2 = 4"... you can mathematically verify them, and they protect our bitcoins.
Regulation for bitcoin, on the other hand, are primarily "You paid me $5M, so I will make it so that anyone who wants to compete with you needs to jump through hoops" and things of the like. These regulations are made primarily to stifle innovation and protect vested interests in old banking systems.
Regulation for banks are for the most part a joke anyways, but banks have shown in the past that they are untrustworthy and have screwed the entire world economy 50 times over. They should be thrown in jail. To basically tell them "yeah, we gave you a slap on the wrist, and now, heck let's just let you do whatever you want" is a BAD IDEA.
Bitcoin can't "do whatever it wants" because everything is set in stone hard mathematics.

it's for signatures.
generating the same random number twice for any signature from the same private key will allow an attacker that knows both signatures to calculate your private key.

Go here, paste in

Then tick Base58. Replace x number of "X"s with your message. Make sure the hex output at the bottom ends up with 42 characters.
Copy those 42 characters of hex and go here 
Then paste them into the box underneath the following text
    4 - Adding network bytes to 3
Overwrite what is in the box below it, and click the "Send" Button. You should notice the address in 9 is your message plus some gibberish at the end.
That is a valid Bitcoin address.
Send 5340 satoshis to it (minimum output to not be seen as spam) and now it's baked into the blockchain.
Although technically you're just baking the bytes into the blockchain... any blockchain parser will read your address in Base58.
Please note when editting the text, 0OIl are not allowed. zero, capital "o", capital "I" and lower case "L" are not allowed.
Edit: Also please note you do not have the private key to the address, so you are effectively throwing away bitcoins at it.

The other day there was a guy who came to a Bitcoin meetup I attended.
He introduced himself as "Hey, I want to get some bitcoins, so where do I get bitcoins?"
I then proceeded to give him a little pamphlet about securing your bitcoins, and includes info on how to make paper wallets,  why blockchain.info is one of the most secure web-wallets (not storing your unencrypted keys etc.) and how one can make backups to not lose coins.
He handed it back to me, and said "yeah, no thanks. So are any of you guys gonna sell me bitcoins or what? I've got 2 grand here burning a hole in my pocket."
Someone hearing that jumps at the opportunity, offers to sell 3 BTC to him for that amount. (at the time price was much less than 667USD, so the seller would have made a good chunk of profit.)
The guy then tries to hand over the 2 grand in cash, and the seller looked in shock "umm... do you have a smart phone or laptop or something?"
The guy then gave the biggest "wuhhh???" face.
He then proceeded to say "if you guys don't want to sell me your bitcoins, then I don't know what's wrong with you. Freakin weirdos."
So yeah, I can't help but imagine anyone who falls victim to the oldest tricks in the bitcoin book as that guy. Now I understand that not everyone had a nice guy offer pamphlets and information to them upfront in person, but still, I feel like a certain percentage of people don't do their due diligence in finding out the best ways to protect their bitcoins.
The wonderful thing about Bitcoins are that you are the only person responsible for them. People who think that people will be responsible with their money should try "storing" their fiat cash with "some guy my friend knows" and sending it to him in the mail.
When you try calling up that guy, and ask "hey could you send me back my cash I sent you?" and he doesn't pick up...

This would require a complete overhaul of the Bitcoin's core possession mechanism, and would be better to be an altcoin.
The problem with your system is that you are basically allowing chargebacks with 0 intermediaries.
Sure, chargebacks are great with credit cards, because if someone is charging back every single transaction on a credit card, the bank will catch on and disallow that person from using their card / attempt to locate and arrest them for fraud.
However, your proposal is "unsupervised chargebacks at will of the fraudster with 0 supervision at any point in time."
Bitcoin would become un-trustworthy, as no one can be sure their bitcoin they received won't be invalidated by any one of the thousands of keys that held any piece of the bitcoin before them.
To put simply, you are basically creating a double spend at will button.
You can argue how it isn't, but that's what it is.

Yeah... considering the controversy around the hashing power possibly becoming centralized, I am hesitant to believe that people will be willing to base a system of trust off of n organizations where the number or bad actors approaching n gives them opportunity to scam approaching 100%.
Sure, I guess it's better than passing n / 2 giving 100%, like SOME algorithms that I have a love-hate relationship with. But I personally think that working together with p2pool to set up a method of donating randomly to one of any of the p2pool nodes would be a better solution that would lower the attack space, incentivize p2pool mining, and keep coins in circulation. (Though I don't see the problem with proof of burn, imo)

Also remember, the last 80 years or so leading up to the 2140 estimated end of block rewards will probably see transaction fees AND block reward being EQUALLY lucrative for the miners.
This will slowly transition as block reward dependency wanes and transaction fee dependency increases.
If transaction volume rises, things should be fine.
Personally, I think it's ingenious.
The beginnings of the network will have little to no transaction volume. (yeah we've come a long way, but 99% of what the miners are after is the block reward) If by the end of the block reward's lifetime, transaction volume hasn't risen to meet and fill that gap, Bitcoin will have been a failure anyways.
It's fairly well thought out, imo.
Edit: But to clarify... this is a "first time in the history of mankind" type situation... so debating it is a definite must. We have no "previous examples" to source... so we need to just think of a bunch of possible scenarios and discuss them. Maybe draw parallels to other things we know.

You can, but as BIP38 private keys are 58 characters long, it would make no sense to just put it as plaintext.
If you shaved off the checksum, it would be exactly 39 bytes, so it'll fit in a single OP_RETURN and still be a standard transaction.
You might want to hide the flagbytes though... or maybe just keep the 0x42/0x43 byte so you know whether it's EC multiplied or not.
As long as you double check the checksum before removing and embedding in the tx you should be fine... and shaving off the 0x01 byte at the beginning might thwart people from noticing it's a BIP38 private key.
The only problem is you'd need a special tool to create/retrieve this private key.
I mean, if you understood how to parse a raw transaction you could always recreate the 6-blabla base58 address by hand just by looking up the raw transaction... but that would require some technical skill...
Also, this would be a pain to spend, and if found out, better have a pretty darn good password.

you could probably convert a private key to a public key by hand in a few hours. It's not too difficult.
1. Convert your private key into binary (with no padding 0s) (remember to make sure it is smaller than the order of the curve.)
2. Starting with the second binary digit from the left (skipping the first 1 on the far left), using the point addition and point doubling equations and starting with the generator point, for every digit, double your current point, AND if the digit happens to be 1, ALSO add your current point to the generator point.
3. Continue doing this all the way down til you run out of digits.
If you get a 256 bit number, you'll have to perform 255 point doubling operations, and however many point additions as you have 1s in your private key, minus the 1 on the far left.
These operations are not very hard... but the numbers are extremely large.

One of the higher upvoted replies to this brings up the "transaction ordering scam" that many banks still do up to this day.
Let's say I get a $500 credit to my account. After seeing that credit to my account, I spend $200, then $300, then I deposit a separate $150, then I spend $20. Expected final balance: $130.
If the all post the same day, the bank can reorder them at will. And will almost always order it as followed.
Balance $0, spend $200, overdraft fee $35, spend $300, overdraft fee $35, spend $20, overdraft fee $35, deposit $500, deposit $150. Actual Final balance: $25.
It has happened to me with BofA on numerous occasions when I was living paycheck to paycheck in college.
I made sure the order was right so that I wouldn't overdraft, barely... but they 100% attacked my transaction order, and reordered my blocks as they pleased.
One of the many reasons I hope the world's financial institutions switch to an impartial blockchain form of transaction management.

You don't **keep all the info** on a less secure device.
The idea is that **in an emergency case where his ONLY Trezor is physically broken and un-usable** he would be able to use one of the above methods to transfer his bitcoins to another wallet for example. Perhaps using Wallet32 to quickly send all his coins into an offline Electrum wallet or secure paper wallet.
The Trezor backup phrase should be kept safe during normal use. However, it is also good to know your options in the event of an emergency. (idk, for example, what if it was proven that Trezor's software was generating weak seeds for the first x months, and someone with a seed generated during that time needed to quickly move their funds somewhere else, but then noticed their one and only Trezor is physically broken. aka VERY RARE cases)
I repeat: no one said to use Wallet32 in conjunction with Trezor, but merely that you could use it to swipe a Trezor wallet in an emergency.

In the end, I think once full node and pruned nodes start becoming widespread, then the issue will take care of itself.

You can "Export" your private keys from Multibit, and "Import" them into Electrum and/or Armory.
However, please remember that the 12 word "seed" phrase that Electrum gives you (and whatever backup stuff Armory gives you) will NOT back up your imported address.
In order to back up your imported address, you need to back up the wallet file itself.
Because of this, I would recommend just sending your funds to a new Electrum wallet, write down the "seed" and never worry about backups again.
If the private key is a special one, like a vanitygen address that someone consistently sends you bitcoins, then I could understand continued usage... but other than that, I would suggest just sending all your funds to the new Electrum wallet.

Simple way to think of it:
Coinbase, Mt.Gox, and the like are basically like a store with a safe. They have the key to the safe and you ask for permission to receive your coins from out of the safe. Gox, one day, disappeared with their safe, and your money, and claimed it was stolen.
blockchain.info is a safe to store safes in. Only you have the key to your safe. blockchain.info just stores your locked safe for you. If blockchain.info disappeared, they would have a bunch of locked safes, so they can't get your coins out. And luckily seeing as this is the digital realm, you also have a copy of your safe, which means you can unlock your safe at will, without blockchain.info. Then import the keys to another local wallet on your computer, and boom. Access to all your bitcoins. If you're worried they'll crack your safe, then import your addresses to a local wallet, and send all your coins to a securely made paper wallet. Done.
Also, blockchain.info is a misleading name. They just have a nice looking site for viewing the info on the blockchain. There are other sites that view the blockchain just like they do, if not better.

Sometimes the bank transfer amount even works out to less than the fiat amount of the original product. This is because the exchange rate circle uses and bitpay / coinbase uses are different.
I wish there was an auto-purchase option with circle, where if you don't have enough bitcoin it auto bank transfers for you. It's a few extra clicks that aren't needed and should be automated.

No you can not create a deterministic wallet that will include an existing key. (or at least not with any wallet software that exists currently.)
If you modified the BIP32 protocol or Electrum's protocol, you could make it use your master private key as the first address in the wallet, then start actually generating down the chain..... so it's not mathematically impossible, but the security implications would be pretty bad, I think...
You can import addresses into Electrum etc.

This site is pretty good, and even though it's browser based, the keys are stored in your browser's HTML5 cache. (So don't use it on a public computer or friend's device) so hive can never steal your keys.
Another way to ensure the same account across devices is to use a service that controls your bitcoins, like Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-12-07 09:04:01
Yes, really.
To derive a public key from your master public key, all you need is the index number (which is a hash of Hash(index number + MPK) ):
    MPK + (index * G) = Address(
If you consider that a public key is just the private key multiplied by G (the generator point of the curve) then look at this.
    (mpk * G) + (index * G ) = (Address * G)
    mpk + index = Address
So all you need is any address private key, and the Master Public Key to get the index hash... then just try it against index    etc. until you get a master private key (mpk) that works out to the Master Public Key (MPK) and since most people probably haven't used millions of addresses on their HD wallet, grinding through the indexes will only take a few milliseconds.
So basically, if you ever figure out how to export individual private keys from the HD wallet, don't.
Technically, a wallet could just forbid one or the other. Either forbid exporting the Master Public Key and disable watch-only functionality permanently or forbid exporting private keys and disable....... ummm... something that could just as easily be accomplished by generating a new independent address on your own?
Also, if the wallet used multiple accounts (look up BIP44) then maybe you could choose "secure accounts" and "insecure accounts" or something because the HD wallets with accounts allow for only MPKs to be generated on an account basis, so compromising one account will not affect the other accounts.
Basically, long story short... you didn't know this, so how do you expect your grandmother to use blockchain.info safely if they allow exporting and importing and e-mail backups and all this stuff as default.
Security defaults should be set with the least savvy user in mind, and allow people, with slight hurdles, to set their security as they please.
My original post was solely talking about DEFAULT SETTINGS. I'm all for control over everything, but don't make that shit default.

The receiving bank verifies it as if they actually received money, and again the hacker erases all traces.
I can't prove it, but bank breaches happen all the time, and one metric that bank security teams use to evaluate employee performance is a "breach recognition time" where the shorter your average time is the better your evaluation.
Bank breaches don't really matter though, because unlike Mt Gox, where they are supposed to give people an asset that can not be duplicated at will, banks can have breaches all the time, seeing as they run off partial reserves anyways.
When hackers steal your bitcoins, they are stealing the keys to move a non-replacatable asset.
When hackers steal fiat, they're just increasing the total supply of numbers on a database. Slowly increasing inflation and lowering the value of everyone's numbers on everyone's databases.
Bitcoin is not a protocol to "be your own bank" it's a protocol to "not need banks period."
Some people view irreplacability as a plus, and some people view it as a minus. It's all about preference.
If you don't like Bitcoin, don't use it. But don't lie and say "online banks never get hacked."
They do. They just don't care.

The r value weakness states that if you compare two signatures from the same private key, and they have the same r value (Edit: weak r values can be brute forced as well), you can calculate the private key. The r value is a random number generated every time you sign.
If you only send bitcoin from a private key once, and continue sending to new addresses with every transaction, you only show 1 signature (and 1 r value) per private key. Thus 0 vulnerability for r value weakness.
(note, however, that when you sign arbitrary messages (ie proof of ownership etc.) you are also revealing an r value.)

No, the sender takes the public key hash OUT OF THE BITCOIN ADDRESS that the receiver gave them.
So the SENDER provides the pubkey hash (which was taken from the receiver's Bitcoin address) and uses it to create the transaction.
You could say the original "provider" is the person giving the sender their address... but the provider to the wallet software that makes the transaction is the sender.

If you have an Android phone, Mycelium is a good bitcoin wallet app.
The cool feature of Mycelium is spending from paper wallets without importing. That way you can keep the change on the paper wallet.
In other wallets, importing a paper wallet destroys the paper wallet so you can't use it anymore (simply put), however the spend from paper wallet feature of mycelium allows you to use the paper wallet over and over again. Just make sure no one sees your private key or QRcode for your private key
@_date: 2014-07-23 00:17:00
Most clients will not allow you to do this once they've noticed, so you have to either
A: have a custom app made for double spending and include no fee in the trick transaction / include a dust output or something to otherwise hinder propagation.
B: send both transactions at the EXACT SAME time (within a few seconds) and HOPE the fraudulent one propagates further than the trick one.
It's possible to do, but even if executed perfectly, there's no 100% way to guarantee it succeeds without over half of the mining power.

BreadWallet is easy to use.
BitWallet is good once he gets his feet wet.
If you start him on BitWallet, he'll be confused at all the buttons and adding wallets and setting up hierarchy trees and public keys and private keys etc.
BreadWallet is just like "receiving payment? QR code, BAM. Paying? paste from clipboard or scan QR code, BAM, done." Very simple to understand. Only difficult (possibly) part is BreadWallet only uses the "bits" unit. (1/1,000,000 of a bitcoin) But it shows your local currency right next to it anyways, so it's not too confusing.
Edit: Not to mention BreadWallet is open source, and BitWallet is not. So I can't review their code for any potentially bad programming practices.

Yes, but remember that this 50% tipping point is actual GH/s and NOT the % shown on blockchain.info.
The 24 hr pool estimate is just "what percent if the last 144 blocks were mined by who?" So I could have 2 MH/s and by Godly chance, mine 144 blocks in the span of 1 minute, broadcast to the network, and my 2MH/s rig would show up as having 100% on the pool estimate even though I don't have 100 Petahashes etc.
This means that GHashio could just hide solved blocks and release them only at certain intervals to maintain a sub 50% pool estimation when in reality they already have 70% of the hashing power.
This is what the OP means.

3. once they're "hooked" and/or you've "gone viral" start placing ads.
4. once you realize ad revenue is shit, start offering "services" (Like Facebook selling likes to Fan Pages etc.)
5. Scam the suckers (people who buy likes from Facebook etc.) and make it as costless as possible to serve each customer, and keep it free.
6. Rely on DAU x ARPPU x Spending Rate to generate your revenue stream. If your service does well and ARPPU is great, then DAU and Spending Rate has some slack to work with. If you have shitty ARPPU then work on getting a higher spender conversion rate. But if all else fails, DAU looks good on press releases... so spam the clickfarm button and get tons of Daily Active Users so you can be the popular kid and get articles written about you.

Some dumb teacher might hear about the silk road and think bitcoins = drugs = zero tolerance suspension.
To OP:
Ask your parents about bitcoins and what they think about it. Ask trusted adults that you know to be smart.
Though I guess smart is relative, so you never know.
Just know that even adults are wrong about things, so never forfeit your courage to think independently just because an adult told you xyz is bad. Honor their advice, process it, and then decide for yourself.
Remember, some adults are avidly against bitcoins and what it stands for, so you may rustle some feathers and people might overreact as if you told them you were looking into drugs.
Sadly, age bias is a part of society, so no matter how much good evidence you provide, some adults just won't listen and oppose anything they don't believe outright.

Correction: the change is from 0.0001 &gt;&gt;---&gt; 0.00001 BTC.

To people saying mining will become less profitable. Maybe, but the mining power and transaction volume will find a new equilibrium. If you can't afford to mine with the new min fees, I'm sorry for your loss.
EDIT: But hey, think of it this way: If you think bitcoin will soar over 5,000 USD, then you're back at the same transaction fee USD wise.

Almost every service that creates OP_RETURN do either one of two things: break up UTXOs into single fee amounts before hand (so you can just reference a single 0.0001BTC utxo and that's your fee) or they send value besides the OP_RETURN output.

And we want more people to use Bitcoin... yet we want to use a system that new people (aka newbs) will be confused about.
Yet the whole idea of using "bits" was to overcome unit bias... (aka to be less confusing to newbs)
So we chose a unit that was supposed to be less misleading to newbs but in practice we created a unit that is more confusing to newbs.
Again, I like "bits" but I think if we're going to change, we should call "the bitcoin" aka the unit of value "the bit" instead and we should never refer to 1,000,000 bits as "a bitcoin" ever again.

Because we can't do anything until the shit hits the fan.
The only real thing we could do is encourage p2pool use and hope no one buys up all the asics.
The reason why we can't do anything is the fact that any change that would fix the 51% attack would also lower profitability for miners. This means they won't upgrade to a version with such a change.
If the choice was upgrade and lose 10% profit or let the ongoing attack succeed and lose 100% profit... They'll update.

Japan here.
Spending decreased because of a bad economy, which was exacerbated by the fact that Japan exports a shit ton and my company specifically posted huge losses due to converting dollars to yen from sales in the US.
Our company welcomed the hyperinflation as long as we were relatively even with the plummeting us dollar.
Once our exchange losses were gone, our bonuses went back to normal and our wives let us go out drinking more.
Prices of vegetables etc that my wife buys daily were not affected during that period. However, unrelated to deflation, our govt. raised sales tax to 8% in April, so spending is stagnating.

That's not the way payment processors work.
1. Customer eats, prices written in USD, expecting USD charge.
2. Customer finishes meal and says pay with BTC.
3. Merchant initiates payment on processor's app. Inputs USD amount.
4. (at least bitpay) USD amount is LOCKED IN for 15 minutes. Meaning even if BTC goes - 90%, they will pay you 100% the USD amount you locked in.
5. Customer pays the BTC amount on the app. (The BTC amount is also locked in)
6. Once the app sees the payment in the network. A screen says OK. The customer may go home now.
I have paid at stores using bitpay about 5 times, one time my app was being weird, and they just left their iPad at my table while I fiddled with my app on my phone... Then when I finally paid, the price was exactly the same in BTC and USD, locked in.

On the other side of the spectrum, trolls will reply to a critical post by either A. going along with it and adding pointless troll nonsense, fueling others to dismiss the original critic along with the troll, or B. if the critic is not critical enough, the troll will accuse them of circle jerking.
Right now it seems like a standoff between circlejerkers and trolls, and the environment is hostile to actual discourse.

You can always see every address you have ever made, and you can label addresses too

Step  Open micropayment channel.
Step  Adjust amounts returning to each party while pumping.
Step  confirm the final amount, and broadcast the transaction.
If someone ran away, the entire amount committed to the micropayment channel would be given to the gas station as a security measure... or they just take it like they take all the CC chargebacks currently.
Or they could just treat it like cash, except you do it at the pump instead of walking in.
You send a transaction sending to shell, their pump HOLDS THE SIGNED TRANSACTION... If you didn't use as much gas as you spent money, they let you re-send the bitcoins to a different amount. (This is basically what micropayment channels do... except this way requires more trust)

For the spikes before it, take each value including the peak and any values that continue on after following peaks (meaning day 240 or so on column 2 is day 0 on column 1 etc etc) and multiply them each by the number gained by dividing the peak price of column 1 with the peak price of the current column.
Plot them on a line graph so that each spikes columns includes the next spike plus a few weeks to the right of it.

Miners will do whatever is in their best interests.
Bitcoin is set up in such a way that the selfish goals of each miner actually works TOWARDS the goals of the network.
In a way, greed and the tragedy of the commons are what support the whole system... Pools getting close to 50% is evidence of this.
The greed of the miners is the fuel that runs the security of the blockchain.
If they could raise the block reward in such a way that it would work out to 69 million BTC total and it wouldn't tank the price (thus lowering miners' bottom lines) then it could be possible... But you would need to convince everyone that somehow it would be profitable.
You are probably thinking more bitcoin = more profit... But unlike the US dollar, we don't have price fixing in Bitcoin... So it's more complicated.

If you can get your hands on a trezor, this may be possible:
1. Authorized employee holds trezor. Generates 1 address on it.
2. Another authorized employee uses an offline system to generate a second address.
3. An automated system within your company holds a third address + private key pair. It is programmed to reject transactions that don't meet specific criteria. This machine can only be accessed by your company intranet, and is not directly touching the internet.
4. All pending complete transactions on this semi-offline system are viewable via internal intranet portals with proper credentials. Completed transactions go out 1 hour after the automated machine in  signs it. (To allow for human error, and double checking time.) To cancel a completed transaction, have the employee with the trezor sign a message saying "cancel &lt;txid&gt;" with the private key used for that multisig.
There's a million ways you can do it. But it also begs the question: Are your higher ups ok with holding bitcoins? (I mean, if you're trying to set up a finance department to use it, I'm sure that means you plan on holding a certain sum of company funds in bitcoins.
Edit: Clarification,  is printed on secure printer and stored in a safe just in case the trezor breaks or the employee goes awol.

2% means that 3 of the last 144 blocks were mined by them.
It's the % that most people freakout on, because there is no provable way for all pools to report accurate hashing power without liars etc.
The idea is, if you solved 51% of the last x blocks you are assumed to have 51% of the hashing power. The larger x is, the more accurate it would be at guessing... But as hashing rates fluctuate.. Not so much.
But I guess it's better than everyone pissing their pants at the fact that we don't know squat.
Edit: please note however, that p2pool accurately broadcasts its total hashing power by design. Also, just as there is no guarantee that flipping a coin 10 times will end up with 5 heads, having 30% might result in solving 50% of the blocks some times.

Electrum contributor here:
If by "keys" you mean private keys, then no. You can not tell the 1000000th private key JUST from knowing the first 999999 private keys.
HOWEVER, if you know ANY one private key AND the MASTER PUBLIC KEY (not private, public) then you can calculate the master private key and thus, every single private key on the HD wallet.
BIP32 implemented "hardened keys" to help combat this, but if you don't use hardened keys, the same problem exists.
Note: This is why when you click "Export Private Key" on Electrum, a rather lengthy warning message is shown. Your MPK is unencrypted in your wallet file, so exposing any Private Key would only require the hacker to also look in your wallet for the MPK and he could put them together to compromise the whole wallet.
Some people hear this, think "OMG DANGEROUS!" and run, but tbh Electrum, and BIP32, have specific properties that give advantages, and with those come disadvantages. Knowing how to use them properly (Notice that almost every wallet besides Electrum does not allow exporting of private keys OR Master public keys.) is the only security you need. The rest is up to how you write down the words or store the seed in some other form.

Then I think we should not call Bitcoins "Bitcoins" but "the bit"
Aka, "Today the bit fell two percent against the US dollar"
"Bits are a new way of transacting in modern day finance."
If we keep calling the main unit "Bitcoin" and news channels say "The bitcoin is now worth $600 down from $1100 peak last November." people will think of bitcoins as "bitcoins is the unit" and then when you say "bits" they will think "bits is a nickname for bitcoins"
I agree with bits... I just think we should change the name of Bitcoin to "bits" and stick with it.

No, you would need the redeemscript.
However, some programs use methods to get around this, like copay, which stores the extended public keys of all participants in the wallet, so that you will be able to generate the pertinent public keys at will.
tl;dr no. You need the public keys of each participant, and with only your private key you can only know your public key.

2. Can not spend until 6 confirms. (This is when it stops being "pending")
3. Required fee of 0.0001 BTC per kB. No way to change.
4. If you try to send your total balance, I expected to see a notification explaining mining fee.... but it was just a red X that says "You don't have enough funds." a newcomer will be baffled when the wallet says 0.01 BTC, and he sends 0.01 BTC and it says "You don't have enough" and that's it.
5. Key stretching at login is very long. 15 seconds using the Chrome app on iPhone 5 (iOS 7.1.1) on Chrome on my PC it took 5 seconds to log in after putting in PIN.

Trust me, it won't happen spontaneously. If it happens, people will have made deals behind closed doors. Once it starts happening, people will leave those pools in droves. If they aren't pools, Bitcoin would be dead before the unknowns could get enough control to make it worthwhile, and by that time they just lost all incentive because bitcoin would fall so hard.
It's happened many times before. Pools lowering block sizes, changing timestamps, gaining too much portion of hashing power, you name it, someone tried it.
The network is comprised mostly of individuals who follow rules so that their Bitcoins keep their value. Anything to even hint towards warranting distrust is the furthest thing from any miner's mind.

Yes, you could do that, but adding the version byte just makes the process quicker, and easier for users. Telling a user addresses with a 1 are ok to send to others and ones with a 5 or L that are encrypted are to stay secret makes the protocol slightly more user friendly for less technical users who might tinker with addresses and prevent some confusion.
But in the end, "But couldn't you do it this way?" type questions are unknown for the most part. In fact, a lot of alt-coins had similar "But couldn't you do it this way?" questions about bitcoin or litecoin, and they went and made an altcoin to prove their idea.

In order for you to be able to use the same phrase to access the same bitcoins, two things need to happen.
1. The same mnemonic algorithm and wordlist must be used.
2. The same HD wallet hierarchy must be used.
The two major mnemonic algos are the Electrum algo with a 1626 word list, and the BIP39 algo with interchangeable wordlists, each must contain 2048 words exactly. Currently only one wordlist exists for BIP39, English.
Hive-web uses m/0'/0/k for receiving addresses and m/0'/1/k for change addresses. So you will need to find a wallet that uses BIP39 with that wallet structure. fyi iOS app breadwallet is exactly the same.
Also, blockchain.info and Armory each have their own arbitrary algorithms for doing things, and the data they are encoding is formatted differently, so no... You can't use a BIP39 seed in blockchain.info

Sometimes the best answer is the most simple:
Inside job from BTER. More than one party was in on the secret hacking deal. Then on the front, "We must make a deal to give this hacker x amount of his stolen goods, so he will return y of them back and mutual destruction is averted!" is the mantra that locks in a couple Mil for the "hacker" (that probably then splits it with the accomplice at BTER)
Same tactics the banks used after 2008 to secure huge bailouts.
The reason why the hacker would give back y amount of the stuff he stole is because he was collaborating with them all along.
No proof, just saying that this would be the explanation with least resistance. If someone would like to explain why a thief who is basically told he is in the clear would come back and give back more than half his stolen goods, I'm all ears.

Most 0 satoshi outputs are created by mining pools for extra meta data storage etc. (this explains how they get mined, as miners can include non-standard transactions if they wish)

So if 100% of the mining power during a 51% attack (which means the 49% of honest miners as well) ALL don't upgrade.
We will have our "Bitcoin" with 0 mining power, and thus, not functional. And the 51% clusterfuck will become a new altcoin?
If our branch isn't getting mined (because you said "it doesn't matter if any miners upgrade") AT ALL, then we don't have anything. The "alt coin" will be the main chain.
The only way for Bitcoin to survive is if the honest 49% upgrade and start mining our new rule chain. (obviously, any fix in this situation would be a hard fork) Even if they mine their chain with more mining power, it won't matter then, and like you said, we can just have all the merchants, users, SPV apps switch over.
But I would like to emphasize, we need miners on our new rule chain, or else the bad miners will just find a way to attack around those new rules and try and do another 51% again. And if like you said "no miners upgrade" then our clients will be incompatible with the only existing chain and our versions' chain will not get mined AT ALL. aka we can't function.

I don't like your snark tone, but you have a point.
So does the other guy.
If you get into bitcoin thinking any online service is foolproof and deserves your trust, your chances of losing all your coin, even if 1%, is still much higher than if you securely generate a paper wallet or n of m scheme and store it securely somewhere safe.
The usability to security trade off is still very sharp, and to lean on the side of security requires learning what my mother could never do ever, and in exchange for that, you can't readily use it as easily.
Still much work to go, but dead it is not.

There's one way. Use Electrum's CSV text input box to create a mutli send-to using the format below.

    1PLeaseGiveMeBackMyCoinsXXXRYyBgv, 0.00006
    1ToTheAddressBeLowXXXXXXXXXYpdAUz, 0.00006
    &lt;the address you want him to send back to&gt;, &lt;remainder of the input&gt;
You might have to do it a few times, Electrum randomizes the output order, so keep trying until the order in the transaction confirmation window matches the order you put them in.
Then click sign, and send away. He'll notice... but maybe just laugh at you...
btw those dummy addresses are valid, but no one owns the private keys, so you will lose 0.00006 BTC x 3.
Edit: You can make messages with valid addresses, but you won't have the private keys.

When you send bitcoin FROM an address, you reveal two things about your address:
1. The public key
2. The signature
While these two things are useless to an attacker ALMOST 100% of the time, there is an increasing security risk by revealing multiple signatures from the same private key.
When you sign something digitally, you need to generate a random number. This number is masked, and then placed within the signature itself.
If, throughout the lifetime of usage of a single address, you were to generate the same number twice for any two transactions, an attacker could then calculate your private key.
If your random number generator is proper, the chances are so low, you should be able to use the same address for millenia and never pick the same two numbers.
However, last summer Android had a huge bug where the random numbers were coming out the same.
Needless to say, bitcoins were lost.
Multisig requires the signature of at least 2 different private keys which are usually signing from two separate devices, so the chance of a big bug causing bitcoin loss via random number generator is much lower.
Also, IF ecdsa ever broke, and attackers could calculate your private key just from knowing your public key, any address that has never been sent from will be safe, as addresses don't reveal the public key unless spent from. Multisig would be vulnerable to this, as sending bitcoin from it reveals every public key involved in the multisig.

If you make $2 a day, but you still want to tip someone, 0.0001 cents is fine.
I am not saying to tip waitresses 0.003 cents, that would be like me asking you if people should tip $5,000 for a funny one liner comment on reddit.
If someone wants to give some random person on the internet a fortune, let them.
Tipping online is mostly just for shits and giggles anyways, so a 10 bit tip for just posting a single word post on reddit is totally acceptable in my eyes.
The coercion to tip larger amounts will artificially create a barrier to entry and my point is we don't need barriers right now.
Don't shun the small change just because some big spenders showed up... Nothing lasts forever, and shunning small tippers now won't make them big tippers someday when they win the lottery or once they get more coins somehow.

Breadwallet: BIP32 doesn't need WIF private keys, all you need is your 12 word seed and the wallet makes all your private keys for you.
In fact, it is INSECURE to export private keys from HD wallets. Electrum lets you do it, and it still astonishes me why they don't remove the functionality.
Not to mention exporting individual private keys defeats the purpose of BIP32 wallets.

Open statement to Robocoin:
Sign a contract with a large mining pool or multiple mining pools that will allow you to designate no-fee transactions to include in their blocks.
Then if you see the transaction in the transaction pool with less than optimal fee, show the customer a screen saying "Hey, I see you have no miner's fee. This can cause the first confirmation to be delayed upwards of 1-2 days. Press this button and we will contact our miner partner network to include you in their next block. (we will take $0.10 off of your redeemed cash)" etc.
Either that, or show in huge red letters on the screen "PAY THE MINER'S FEE, OR WAIT A DAY OR TWO, TAKE YOUR PICK LOLOLOL"
Or you can be a Good Guy Greg about it, and if you notice a no-fee transaction, pay some mining pools like $0.10 to get it put into their next block.

It depends on how much coin you own. Small amounts in Coinbase, or any wallet really are fine... you might lose them in many ways, but if its small, then impact is low.
If you own a significant amount of coinage... you should REALLY look into Electrum's OFFLINE mode.
This mode allows you to install Electrum on an offline computer (like maybe a junk one you don't use anymore) that you KEEP OFFLINE, and then you can install a "watch only" version of the SAME wallet on your ONLINE computer.
This way you can manage your addresses online without any risk of your bitcoins being stolen (the private keys will all be on the OFFLINE device)
Transactions will be created by your online computer, then carried to your offline computer via USB etc. and then signed offline, then the signed transaction is carried to the online computer and broadcasted.
However, if you have small amounts that you are comfortable risking with just one password / the possibility of malware on your computer, then just install it and write down the 12 words just in case.
If you use offline with significant amounts, DEFINITELY WRITE DOWN YOUR 12 WORD SEED AND DOUBLE/TRIPLE CHECK SPELLING / LEGIBILITY. SO MANY PEOPLE WITH BAD HANDWRITING CHICKEN SCRATCH THEIR PHRASES THEN LOSE BITCOINS.
Remember, if you're using an offline methodology, you're a bank, now. Use good security practices.

Eligius will mine it for me as long as I give enough fees.
If you want to know how I do it. I make my transaction, and sign it, manually using EC math in Python.
The RNG is the hash of the raw tx message concatenated with 32 bytes of os.urandom, so you could use it with a personal address, but I'd recommend making a new address for using it. (Just in case hashlib and os.urandom are ever both broken)

BIP39 and BIP32 are clearly defined and mathematical in nature.
If Hive-web went down permanently, I could write a script to give you all the individual private keys in about 10 minutes, using simple math with big numbers in some scripting language.
Trust me, if hive went down, other people would either A. Put out their own hive wallet (open source, remember?) or B. Put out a hive seed recovery tool that someone slapped together in 10 minutes.
You're fine as long as you have your seed.
@_date: 2014-07-13 13:23:07
Because 6^99 = 1.09 x 10^77 and 2^256 = 1.16 x 10^77 so they are relatively close. As private keys are 256 bit, you want randomness close to 256 bit.
Electrum uses 128 bits for its seeds. (any longer and you'd have 24 words, 36 words, 48 words etc. and the idea was that "128 bits is enough to be safe while keeping word count down so people can memorize their seeds easier)
6^50 = 8.08 x 10^38
2^128 = 3.4 x 10^38
so 50 times is more than enough, but 49 times is much smaller than what is needed.

2. Can not spend until 6 confirms. (This is when it stops being "pending")
3. Required fee of 0.0001 BTC per kB. No way to change.
4. If you try to send your total balance, I expected to see a notification explaining mining fee.... but it was just a red X that says "You don't have enough funds." a newcomer will be baffled when the wallet says 0.01 BTC, and he sends 0.01 BTC and it says "You don't have enough" and that's it.
5. Key stretching at login is very long. 15 seconds using the Chrome app on iPhone 5 (iOS 7.1.1) on Chrome on my PC it took 5 seconds to log in after putting in PIN.

it's all good.
If you would like to set up a wallet, there are many choices for you out there.
One of my favorites is called "Electrum."
Download it here: 
Just download the executable for your OS, start a new wallet. (be sure to write down the passphrase it gives you. That passphrase will allow you to recover your funds in the event of your computer crashing etc.)
Once you start the wallet, write down the passphrase and set a password (note: the password will be used when sending bitcoins, the passphrase will only be used to restore a broken / lost wallet)
I would like to stress that you should DEFINITELY write the pass phrase down, and DEFINITELY choose a good password to lock your wallet.
Once that is done, click on the "Receive" tab, and right click the top address and click "Copy to clipboard"
Paste that all up on your website, blog, etc etc etc...
Then watch the bitcoins roll in.
Stay classy, man. :-)

Nope. Coinbase is not the US government, so they don't have to follow the constitution at all.
The constitution is basically like regulation for laws and government powers. It does not regulate business.
There can be LAWS created BASED ON ideas in the constitution that regulate business, but the constitution holds squat in a civic dispute between a business and customer. ESPECIALLY when you've agrees to their terms of service.
Terms of service usually have two clauses in them: 1. We can terminate your service whenever and for whatever reason. 2. You can't sue us, recourse will be done through arbitration.
Read the terms people.

Check your balance after the transaction confirms.
0.0009 BTC out of that should return to your wallet.
They take the 0.001 initially to cover any Bitcoin network fees. Most come out to just 0.0001, so 0.0009 comes back afterwards.
Xapo has a weird system, but whatever.
If you actually used 0.001 in fees, I wonder... How many transactions have you RECEIVED to your address?
If you accumulated that bitcoin stash over the course of 70 or 60 ish transactions, then that would be why it costed 0.001.
70 inputs with 2 outputs would work out to about 9500 bytes ish, which should work out to 0.0001 x 10 for the miner fee.

Yes, I think that should be the first law.
1. No one may be denied access to Bitcoin, under any circumstances.
However, for instance, known, convicted money launderers (not "suspected") or anyone proven to be associated with organized crime or convicted of specific crimes may be required to be banned from using Bitcoin in their probation terms etc. (though it would be hard to check).
But that has less to do with Bitcoin than with laws to deal with probation etc. I mean, I'm free to own a gun in the US, but someone on probation might not be, same thing.

True. Which is why I think education needs to be a higher priority in a lot of the dumb countries of the world.
The reason I am playing devil's advocate is that this proposal began with the "unit is too expensive so I have psychological block to buy it."
Someone like you and I who can understand that bitcoins can be bought in decimal places and we properly understand milli- and micro- as units are fine. We don't have this block.
However, the people who DO have this psychological block are most likely not the brightest bulbs in the shed...
Remember, these are people if you told them to switch their dollars to yen when they go to Japan will say things like "yen are so cheap!" just because 1 USD gets you 102 yen...
So if you say "Want to buy some bits?" then the conversation will eventually involve bitcoins. Then they're back to thinking in BTC again... is what I think this type of person would do.
Which is why I think the point is moot unless we completely re-brand Bitcoin, get rid of the name "Bitcoin" completely, network AND currency wise... then re-brand as "Bits" or "The Internet Bit" like "Dollars" or "The US Dollar" and just call the network "The Blockchain."
If we want to keep bitcoins as a name... adding a denomination will not remove the thing we want to remove. Or at least that is what I think.

Seconding this: They have been doing shady shill stuff since I first saw them on bitcointalk. One of their biggest opponents was Greenaddress.it.
I saw one thread dissing GreenAddress a ton, then when people reacted poorly to the shills (understandable) the NEXT DAY there was a post pumping greenaddress and dissing Frozenbit. Then there were a ton of shills saying things like "omg greenaddress is doing it too!" etc. trying to counter-act their recent shilling by making it look like greenaddress was shilling too.
Of course, posting that fact in any of those threads got downvoted to oblivion. (I wonder why)
Which leaves me with one question: Why?
Seriously, at this point, if their leader or CEO or representative or someone would just come out and say "we paid xyz to shill for us in these threads because we were scared that our service would not do well." then ACTUALLY PUT OUT A SERVICE. Then I'd be more than glad to sign up.
The fact that they blatantly shilled so much, then expect me to be hyped about their product is ludicrous.

It would be much easier to just implement BIP32 and refresh the address after every received transaction (even if no confirmations) and keep a gap limit of 20 addresses per user.

bitbank wallet only requires a credit card (can be from any country) and lets you buy up to 3,000 JPY worth with 0 KYC AML info. Just CC.

Because a normal computer can guess Brainwallets at about a speed of a few billion per second...
Whereas BIP38 requires the attacker must have the encrypted key to begin with. And a normal computer can only guess maybe 2-3 passwords per second.
If you make a brainwallet with the password "password" then your coins are gone... But even with a high entropy password, there are server farms out there sweeping brainwallets constantly at rates on the order of billions per second, and no one needs anything you own.
BIP38 is a great mixture of physical security (the attacker NEEDS the encrypted key in order to crack it) and digital security (BIP38's encryption and decryption is purposely slow)
Don't use brainwallets.

Apparently BitWallet scans the hierarchy that you choose at startup, and that's it.
Other wallets check their default hierarchy plus the change address hierarchy related to their default hierarchy.
A slight inconvenience... It just means if you want to use hive web wallet or breadwallet with it you'll need to restore the same wallet twice. Once for external and once for internal (change) and manage them as two separate wallets on BitWallet (though you could just consolidate them into one if you found it cumbersome)

rather than controversy, because there are two separate chains, it would be a huge double spend fest. Anyone who didn't know there was a hard fork going on could be duped into paying huge amounts of money, then when the hard fork ends they'd have a 50/50 chance of losing their bitcoins.
Plus, a hard fork in a cryptocurrency, considering all exchanges are OFF-chain usually causes everyone to sell that currency for something else that ISN't hard forking... tanking the price into oblivion.
So  would cause the price to fall into oblivion and increase fraud by 100 fold, and no one would trust Bitcoin while it was hard forking... and a lot of people would continue to not trust bitcoin after it was over, I'm sure.
I'd say that isn't controversy but chaos.

If the audio recording ONLY contained what she directly quoted in the article, I don't think that is enough to prove the man is the real Satoshi.
Imagine you used to work for government contracts. The NSA, FBI, etc. on what you were told were top secret projects. They make you sign agreements to not EVER divulge information about what you worked on. Not only this, but most of the time, they only give you enough information to complete your job, and don't tell you what the result will be used for. (This is to eliminate the risk of leaking information)
I think anyone with such a history, when hearing a reporter asking about something he is not familiar with, would probably think "I don't remember everything I worked on for the govt. and even the things I do, the NSA could have used it for anything. This reporter must have something on me that she's not telling me... so I'll just deny involvement." and that mixed with not being the best English speaker, he could have easily said "I am no longer involved with any of that." (referring to government contracting in general) and SHE took it to mean "I am no longer involved with Bitcoin." and took that it IMPLIED admission of being involved in the past.
I think this is not enough evidence to say with 100% certainty it is him.


I don't think using the same name as your real name and being old have anything to do with the likelyhood of someone being involved. Heck, the real Satoshi could be a Satoshi Nakamoto living in Sri Lanka and could be 100 years old for all I care.
I just think that if you're going to paint a $400 Million dollar target on a man's back and show a picture of his house on a national news magazine and website. You need 100% irrevocable proof to your claims, otherwise you're just a gossip columnist.

Getting Electrum or Armory to be able to use it would require changing the way their wallets work fundamentally.
However, if the mnemonic wordlist used are the same, AND the BIP39 passphrase is the same (currently no one uses it yet), AND the default hierarchy path for the wallets are the same, AND the gap limits are the same THEN the seeds are interchangeable.
fyi web.hivewallet.com uses the trezor-english wordlist (the only wordlist available currently) with BIP39, no passphrase with BIP39, and the wallet path is m/0'/0/k for receiving addresses and m/0'/1/k for change addresses.
Currently, breadwallet uses the exact same wallet format, so they can use each other's seeds 100% interchangeably.
Also, bitWallet for iOS allows you to select which hierarchy to use, and m/0'/0/k and m/0'/1/k are both selectable... Unfortunately, they will be treated as separate wallets.
BIP44 aims to fix the problem of everyone and their mother making up their own wallet format, allowing ubiquitous wallet formats... But it doesn't seem to be going too well.
**Edit:** gap limit

basically, a signature is a function of your private key, the hash of the transaction (which is what they refer to in that quote) and a random number.
These are fed into a function, and a value is spit out. This value, when plugged into a DIFFERENT function with your PUBLIC KEY, then verifies whether or not the value corresponds with the hash of the transaction and your keypair or not. Thus you can prove that you own the private key, that you signed off on the transaction, and everyone else can verify it with your public key only.

I recommend starting with a mobile wallet if you have Android or iPhone.
For Android: Download "Mycelium" from the app store.
For iPhone: Download "breadWallet" from the app store.
Both of them have a "backup phrase" that you should definitely WRITE DOWN ON PAPER. DO NOT JUST SCREEN CAPTURE IT!!!!!! (in fact, breadWallet will get mad at you and generate a new phrase every time you screenshot it)
If you want to put it off til you have time to kill, then both wallets let you read your backup phrase at a later time.
Then, as for getting bitcoins, I recommend circle.com if you're in the US. In the EU, I seem to remember some .de site that was recommended a lot... if you can read Japanese  allows you to buy 3000 yen worth of Bitcoin by just doing SMS authentication (international OK) and then you can use any VISA or MASTERCARD (international OK) to buy bitcoins instantly.
One reason I recommend mobile wallets is that they usually have cameras and are easier for reading QR codes. (QR code is kinda the standard for quickly paying bitcoin invoices on sites etc.)

Bitcoin transactions are puzzles.
The spender solves the puzzle of an earlier transaction, and that's what proves he can spend the coins.
Bitcoin limits the number of steps you are allowed to take to solve the puzzle.
That limit has been raised so theoretically more complex transactions are possible. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:49:51
First you generate a random number k
k when used in a process called Elliptic Curve Multiplication against the generator of the curve, gives you a point on the curve called R... the x coordinate is r.
    r = x value of R = k x G
the hash of the message (the transaction) is z and your private key is p.
Also, the order of the curve (the modulo) is n
after getting r, plug all your numbers into this equation.
    ? = (k^-1)(z+pr) mod n
This gives you a value (since you know all those) which is known as "s".
Your digital signature is just r and s being shown as hexidecimal values.
You can verify that a given private key actually signed it (aka a person who knows the number that is your private key, assumed only you)
Again, EC Multiplying,... the relationship of private to Public key is (Public) = (private) x (Generator point)
So if P = pG here is what we do to check the r and s values if they were signed by p. Only by using P (public)
    a = z x s^-1 mod n
    b = r x s^-1 mod n
So we use a and b like this: (this is called Elliptic addition)
    C = (a x G) + (b x P)
The result is a point C on the curve. Compare that point's x with the r value, if equal, you are certain the person who generated that s value owned the private key.
Here's why this is so:
    C = (a x G) + (b x P)
    C = (a x G) + (b x p x G)   (This is because P = pG)
    C = (a + bp) x G
    C = (z x s^-1 + r x s^-1 x p) x G
    C = (z + rp) x s^-1 x G   (definition of s from earlier)
    C = (z + rp) x (z + rp)^-1 x (k^-1)^-1 x G
z + rp both cancel out, and -1 x -1 exponents makes exponent 1.
    C = k x G
Which is why if the s value was made using the private number associated with P, we can verify that this s value is valid by comparing the r value in the signature with the r value given by the verification method, but without ever needing the private key itself to verify.

It's not lower fees, but NO fees. There's a break point, and if you're over that point, then you don't require a fee AT ALL.
However, each block only puts up to 50 kb worth of "eligible no-fee transactions" so you might not always get put in the next block.
A rule of thumb for that is as follows:
1. Your transaction must be 1000 bytes or less.
2. Each OUTPUT of the transaction must be AT LEAST 0.01 BTC (this INCLUDES change outputs)
3. Your priority rating must meet a certain level. 1 BTC that has 144 confirmations when your transaction is 250 bytes will be the cut off point. (hint: 144 blocks is roughly 1 day) You can change any of the variables (but remember transaction can't be more than 1000 bytes) and effect it. The more BTC and more confirmations and LESS bytes you have the better... so 144 confirmations but 1000 bytes would require 4 BTC...  288 confirmations and 250 bytes would require 0.5 BTC etc. etc.
But basically it's an on/off switch. If you don't meet the 3 requirements above then you follow normal fee rules for network relay.
Edit: the smallest possible no-fee transaction would be 1 0.01 BTC input sent to 1 0.01 BTC output, the transaction would be 225 bytes, and require 12,960 confirmations before it could be sent (that's roughly 90 days)

This is not true.
SPV clients such as Electrum, MultiBit, breadWallet, Mycelium etc. are the same speed, if not faster, than full validation.
They store the blockchain headers (which contain the merkle root) and receive transactions only dealing with their wallets, along with the merkle paths necessary to connect each transaction with the merkle root of its respective block.
As far as unconfirmed transactions are concerned, they receive them instantly and when confirmed they then receive the merkle path afterwards.

341 inputs from uncompressed keys = 61799 byte large transaction. (Estimated)
So you will need to pay 62 x per kb default fee. So even if you went by pre-0.9.0 rules, would only be 0.0062 BTC in fees... (though you could get away with 0.00062 BTC with the new fee rules... though miners tend to shy away from large transactions, so I might put 0.002 BTC on there just to add incentive.)
However, regardless. Even with 341 inputs, that does not explain a difference of over a bitcoin.

You forget, it's a RIPEMD160 hash OF A sha256 hash.
The idea was two fold:
1) decrease length of the Bitcoin address.
2) protect against one hash algo being cracked. The thought being that 2^160 is enough address space, and even if one of the hash algos is cracked, your public key is still safe. (The assumption being that if something could crack a hash ECDSA will have probably been broken, so uncovering the pubkey will be the equivalent of finding bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-11 04:19:20
I'm over-simplifying. It's alot more safe, but basically this:
Your 12 word seed creates a private key, let's call it 47, and then generates 5 addresses, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51.
Those 5 are the only ones you can see initially in Electrum at the beginning.
Once you send bitcoins to any one of those, Electrum creates 52.
Electrum makes sure there's always 5 fresh addresses at all times.
Now when you restore, the words create the same 47, and on restoration, Electrum says to itself, I will generate addresses and check transaction histories until 5 fresh addresses are generated, then stop.
And that is a reeeeeeally simplified version of whats happening under the hood. Its TONS safer than just adding one to the private key.

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.
Basically, it's a specific type of curve (y^2 = x^3 + ax + b) that is mirrored on the x axis and has specific properties.
That's the EC part. The DSA part is a key-pair known as the private key and the public key.
The private key, in the equation, is a very very large prime number (a number that can not be factored except by itself or 1) that is used in an equation to calculate a point on the curve. This point is the public key.
Then in order to sign something, you use the large prime number along with a random number and the other reference variables in the equation to create another point at (r, s). This point can be verified by the original "public-key" point through a complicated formula that utilizes the properties of elliptic curves.
It is easy to verify that the public key is made from the private key that signed the message, but it is INSANELY HARD to derive the private key integer from that signature.
Fun fact: the random number in the signature equation is SUPER IMPORTANT. The Playstation 3's firmware used to have a shoddy implementation of ECDSA where they used the same number for the random number EVERY SINGLE TIME. This allowed for the jailbreaking team to solve the equation for their private key easily (like Algebra II easy) and they basically could sign any software they wanted... until Sony released a new firmware with a proper implementation.

Android's are slow enough with crypto as it is... having them parse through every op_return transaction, ECC multiply their scan privkey with each pubkey, hash it, then ECC multiply that with the generator point, then ECC add that point to their own spend pubkey, then check to see if the resulting point's bitcoin address is in the same transaction... then do this hundreds of times (thousands and millions if stealth addresses as they are now take off)
Stealth addresses are not scalable, so I think they will change the protocol for it. It's too soon to be spending valuable resources to implement a feature that will most likely change.

Q: When you make these accounts, were you using a lot of the same letter combinations in your passwords?
The mnemonic on blockchain.info is basically:
    Checksum | guid | utf-8 encoded password
Those bytes are encoded into mnemonic phrases, so if you use similar passwords to create all those accounts, a lot of word combinations will be similar.
The mnemonic thing, as far as blockchain.info is using it, is just a clever way of getting the user to write down their password without it being overtly obvious to anyone who sees the mnemonic.
Your mnemonic in other programs are the seeds used to generate the addresses... For blockchain.info, it's the password to get into your account, masked and with a checksum for good measure.

Not really. Large random numbers are the basis of cryptography and are not considered to be "flaws" or even "design flaws"... it's just known as "cryptography."
Cryptography's security model is based on a model of security where the amount of work required to detect a secret is so astronomical that it is virtually impossible in the most mathematically sound way.
In the same way, if two people generated a private key, and those private key worked out to the same pubkey hash, they would have accomplished something that is likened to the odds of winning every single Lottery of every single country every single time from now until the sun of the solar system implodes.

1. You don't need the private keys, all you need is the seed. Each private key is derived from your seed, so saving your seed backs up every private key on your wallet, even if you create 1000000000000 addresses.
2. Install Electrum on an offline computer (or a bootable liveCD of some linux distro if you're super paranoid)
3. Create a new wallet. Write the seed down on paper, double and triple check spelling.
4. Once you open the wallet, Click Wallet &gt; Master Public Key in the menu bar. (Which may be at the top of the window or the top of the screen depending on your OS)
5. Save this long number to a txt file and save it to a USB.
6. Take this txt file and load it to your daily use online computer.
7. Install Electrum and "create watch only wallet" using the long number in the txt file.
8. Store your written seed in a safe place.
Now your online computer can generate new addresses and check / manage balances, but it can't spend them.
The seed you wrote down can be restored at any time by clicking New Wallet and choosing restore from seed.

I was talking about stealth addresses.
Stealth addresses require checking each op_return txOut on every tx including them and performing operations using the data stored in the OP_RETURN in order to figure out which outputs belong to them.
This can not be done on the server because in the mathematical equation that is performed, the user's stealth private key is required. Divulging this private key will basically tell everyone your stealth address's balance, defeating the purpose of stealth addresses.
So even if mycelium kept a record of every OP_RETURN and their respective data sets, your android would still need to do all the ECC math locally for privacy reasons. As the number of stealth transactions increase the time it takes to find your balance increases. The number of operations required to perform increases etc. draining battery.
This is why adding stealth address support is not a good idea for android clients until someone can make an SPV server that properly categorizes opreturns. (Like obelisk, the dark wallet server)
Also there needs to be a better way to search for balance... Right now it would be a battery sucker for Android.

Yes, but you would need an external Hard Drive to store the Blockchain.

1. the idea behind taking the hash of the phrase was IF your wallet did not support the language, you could still generate their wallet for them. (This was probably envisioned as: 1. check if every word matches any list we support. 2. if not, tell the user their words are not supported and ask if they want to generate the wallet anyways. 3. if the words ARE supported, decode them and check the checksum etc.)
2. if you wanted to include a QR code next to it, you could include the hash of the mnemonic phrase (the "result"). Electrum did the same thing when they showed the QR with the seed. the mnemonic was written, but the QR had the seed in binary data format.
3. BIP39 was made with trezor in mind. This is why the use cases that seem to be at the pretense of the BIP are based on the "backup one HD wallet with one seed" and not "encode arbitrary data" if you want to use BIP39 to encode arbitrary data, as long as you have the word list when decoding, you can just reverse the encoding step. If you want to import specific accounts, use the xprv xpub format, or decode the base58 and take the binary data of the xprv and encode it in the BIP39 style if you want. No one's stopping you.
4. Again, you have to recognize the context that this BIP was designed under. You can use BIP39's method and change it however you would like, no one is stopping you. Seeing as BIP39 is just a method of tying a phrase with a BIP32 seed. If you want every BIP to include every possible use case that anyone can think up (without ever even using it) then nothing would ever get finalized.
That being said, I suggest following bips more closely, put it on your watch list and chime in whenever a new addition is made. Maybe the next BIP will be greatly changed for the better because of your input.
As for BIP39, use it however you'd like, but the "standard use" of it is written.

Yes, but still. BIP32 has not specified a methodology for Hierarchy.
It makes "a suggestion" but it does not state "This is the standard we want everyone to follow."
When asked about this, they have stated that they don't want to standardize the hierarchy and will let other BIPs do that...
afaik BIP43 and BIP44 are the only ones that make mention of a set method for hierarchy. BIP44 makes the most logical sense so far, and the writers of BIP44 are making it in such a way that any further revisions will not affect backwards compatibility.
However, for instance, Dark Wallet has "stealth addresses" which is something completely new that BIP32 people AND BIP44 people did not account for... so DW tells how they generate Scan pubkeys and the like considering that the private keys must remain unencrypted in the wallet, yet still be generate-able from the BIP32 seed.
Long story short... we need more standardization... but we're just innovating so fast that we can't keep up with each other...

Primes thing might be wrong, I'll give you that.
But the private key is definitely NOT a point, it is an integer.
Public key is a point on the curve, private key is a coefficient, aka an integer.
This is why the public key is twice as long as the private key, the public key is x and y coords, while the private key is just a value.

For electrum phrases (pre 2.0), switch the first two words. Any combination generates a valid wallet.

The blockchain is SUPER INEFFICIENT AT DOING A CENTRALIZED LEDGER.
All you need to do a centralized ledger is an SQL database. The end.
The only reason old banking is slow, non transparent, and high fees, is because of regulations and being a for-profit organization.
If I run a business, what do I gain by showing you all my account balances? Nothing. They have the ABILITY to send money overseas instantaneously and convert to any other currency for no fees. They just don't want to, and the regulators will red tape them to death.
So if banks handle crypto, they will only handle it for two purposes: 1. avoid or circumvent existing regulation. Especially if bitcoin gets a more lax regulatory climate than current banks, they'll jump on it like no other. 2. If they believe the customers want it enough to where they would choose a bank offering crypto over one that doesn't etc.
2 is a long ways away, but 1 might be here in a couple years. IF we get let off easy with the regulation side of things.

Also remember, the password you set on your wallet encrypts your seed. But if someone has your 12 word phrase, they do NOT need your password to recover your bitcoins. So if you ever forget your password, inputting the 12 word phrase will restore your bitcoins, and you can set a new password.

Or you could just clone Electrum's master HEAD and type &lt;OP_RETURN: "test"&gt; without the less than greater than signs to create an output that says test.
If you want to actually send btc in the same transaction, current master head accepts multiline send to box in csv format... So to send 0.01 btc to 1abc and an opreturn saying  heres the payment, the following can be pasted into the send to box
    1abc, 0.01
    OP_RETURN: "heres the payment"

What a horrid teacher.
Education is the act of teaching children to think critically of everything and weigh the evidence themselves.
If the teacher had left out the "Bitcoin is x" and "I will only accept this when you write about how bitcoin is x" and merely stated something along the lines of "the paper seems based on certain pretenses that are controversial. Please address these issues (such as "Is Bitcoin a ponzi scheme?" etc.) in your paper and defend your stance." then I would say the teacher was right.
Again, I'd like to reiterate; my beef is with the way the teacher discouraged one side of an argument and told the student he's wrong and that he should support the other side blindly. Teachers are not meant to indoctrinate like that.
I would focus less on defending your opinion (aka showing him Andreas speeches) and focus more on the fact that the teacher is not facilitating thought, but blatantly indoctrinating students.
The principal will not care about who's right on the issue, and will most likely brush you off if all you seem to care about is bitcoin not being a ponzi.

Read paypal's agreement. You could not sue them even if they took all your money. Unless you opted out of it, you are bound to arbitration, which means no jury, no judge, just a guy who "arbitrates."
Since you will never give him repeat business but the big companies will, he is more likely to side with them and not you btw.
Anywho, that aside.
Multi-sig escrow can only be abused by the escrow server in one way: Giving the other person the funds when it was obvious they should have returned to you, or the other way around.
The way this would work most likely is that your funds would be locked in a three way multisig with one key in your possession, one in the escrow's possession, and one in the other party's possession.
If everything goes well, you and the other party sign and the bitcoins go to the other party. In this situation you could specify a length of time to the other party, like 90 days. And you would sit with your funds in limbo for 90 days, and then make a decision of who the coins go to. Of course this would all be decided before-hand. Like a 30 day money back guarantee by a seller, or a 90 day trial period, or whatever conditions you want to set.
Another way it can work is similar to Greenaddress.it's "instant confirmations" and basically it would work similar to paypal.
When I send bitcoins using Greenaddress, I am signing a transaction that requires 2 out of 2 keys (1 I hold, 1 GA holds) and they sign it and relay it to the bitcoin network. That way I can set spending limits etc. to minimize damage if my wallet is compromised.
What they COULD do, is every time I buy something with them, they could create an option to allow chargebacks. This would create a transaction for the amount I want to send, generate an output of that size in one of my new addresses (by sending it to myself first) then I would sign the output to the address intended. Greenaddress would hold on to the partially signed transaction, and then remove the balance from my wallet. They would view that output as no longer mine. Heck, they could even make my half-signed transaction point towards their "chargeback OK pool" or something to manage funds similar to Coinbase, just on-chain.
Then if I decided "I want to charge back" they would destroy the transaction.
The logistics would be much more complicated than that, I'm sure... plus the current Bitcoin demographic are all "NO CHARGEBACKS YAYYYY!!!" so innovation in the chargeback area of Bitcoin will not be coming for a while...
I think it's pretty unanimous in the Bitcoin community that "if you wanted to chargeback, you'd use scam-bucks, aka fiat."
I use whatever fits my purpose. Everything doesn't need to be good at everything in life. Specialization is what enables our society, and Bitcoin specializes in being a push-based non-reversible currency.

Yes, money is free if you're a bank.
That's what the fractional reserve is all about.
They borrow $5 from the federal reserve, and that gives them the right (under a 5% fractional reserve system) to give out loans to people for up to $100.
Same thing with deposits. If their customers have $1,000 in deposits with them, bringing their total assets to $1,005, then they can lend out up to $20,100.

Miners AND nodes already deny transactions with used inputs anyways.
Double spending usually happens because a person generates a transaction that only n% of the miners accept, then double spend using a transaction that every miner accepts.
ie, double spend uses OPRETURN, or low fee, or no fee, then nodes ignore his transaction. BUT the double spend transaction has proper fees and uses standards that are accepted by everyone.

Thanks a lot. I am a big fan of GMG for a while.
I am really glad I can buy games from them without divulging private info.
Just so you know, I have experimented with VPN/no-VPN etc etc and seeing what gets what results with Bitcoin. I have come to the following conclusion.
Their Bitcoin payment internal flag only looks at the "Billing Address" set up with the account.
Seeing as Bitcoin doesn't need to verify addresses like CC do, you can just put any valid US address in as your billing address and use Bitcoin to pay for anything on the site. (this can be done with a brand new account as well)
However, as you are probably aware, some publishers restrict the region they can sell their products.
These products actually look at the IP address, and require a VPN / Proxy to purchase.
(I guess that last part is not really Bitcoin related... but I just wanted to point out as contrast. Using Bitcoin is easy with GMG, no matter which country you're in)

Hmm, you need to do a little more study into the way the PoW algorithm works.
The SHA256 algo that the miners use doesn't protect things from being tracked, it ENSURES things can be tracked ACCURATELY.
This is because in order to create a hash for the block that is below the target, trillions upon trillions of hashes must be attempted to (probability theory) be able to come up with that hash.
This means that some guy in his basement can't just replace a block halfway down the blockchain with a different transaction and brute force the hash. It would take longer than our sun's lifespan.
So if double sha256-ing was broken... you actually would NO LONGER be able to track anything, as anyone with a crappy laptop who knew how to crack it could make their own funny money chain and pass it off as the real bitcoin chain. A disaster.
However. Bitcoin has a few aspects about it that sort of forsee the cracking of hashing algos.
If you create a Bitcoin address, it is a RIPEMD160 hash of a SHA256 hash of an ECDSA Public Key. This means if RIPEMD is broken, they can only see the SHA256. If ECDSA is broken, no one knows your public key unless you have A. spent bitcoins FROM that address before or B. posted a signed message with that address before (on a forum or something) So let's say you store 1000 BTC in one Bitcoin address and never spend money from that address, the only way you would be in trouble is if 1. Double SHA256 broke and there was no checkpoint created after your block. 2. RIPEMD160 AND SHA256 AND ECDSA are all broken.
Another developing Security related feature is known as "Stealth Addresses" which I think will be the future... however, security wise, it relies solely on ECDSA. as all pubkeys are embedded in the address directly, a new bitcoin address is created by a diffie hellman shared secret, and bitcoins are sent to it. They also support m of n P2SH multisig addresses.
Bitcoin security is still growing, you chose a great topic.
Feel free to ask questions.

Ok, let me rephrase:
"We should discourage use of single sha256 brainwallets among new users, as there is no key stretching to assist in preventing brute forcing. The more easy and "user friendly" we make brainwallets, the more non-technical users will create bad brainwallets, get money stolen, and then they will most likely become an anti-bitcoin evangelist for years to come."
Don't use brainwallets. Randomly generated mnemonic phrases with multiple iteration key stretching is ok. (a la Electrum / BIP39)
tbh I would have no problem with brainwallets if they used Electrum's key stretching algorithm with 1,000,000 iterations and sites forbid inputs less than 16 characters long.

The pay fees option is for people who are eligible for free transactions. We've fixed it for the next version to be more explanatory. (the main dev implemented it and none of us paid much attention to its wording, more to its functionality... o.o; )
If your transaction qualifies for a free transaction and you turn on pay fees, it will pay a fee anyways. (there is a set number of slots per block for free transactions. And they usually fill up fast... so a "free" transaction (aka "High Priority") will usually end up getting confirmed in a couple blocks.)
The fee changing thing intrigues me... do you receive a lot of small transactions on a regular basis?
If you try to send more than possible I believe it just tells you 100 bits fee, but in actuality it is 100 bits x size of the transaction in kilobytes.
If you receive a lot of small amounts of bitcoins in many transactions... this will usually knock your transaction size up to 2 or 3 kb... that means 200 or 300 bits.
If it was just one transaction you were trying to spend, I would really like to know the transaction id (you could PM it to me) so I can try to fix the error.

You assume that Bitcoin fails, though... As you are basically estimating under the pretense that by the time fees take over we we have roughly the same amount of transaction volume and that it will drop to 10%
By the time block rewards give way to fees, invertible bloom filters and block size increases will allow for much higher volumes of transactions, and the fee market will most likely be a function of max block size and transaction volume, as once invertible bloom filters cone into play, almost every block will be filled to the brim.
Gavin gave a road map for increasing block size, but I have a feeling if Bitcoin succeeds, that will be increased even more.
If the max block size was ever removed, then fee market would be a function of pure transaction volume function.
Huge fees will come about IF the max block size doesn't scale, and if transactions are more than can fit in the blocks. (Supply and demand of space in the block will drive the fee market... Small blocks with tons of transactions will cause miners to prefer higher fees)
Edit: I wonder if regulation of the max block size will become some global political issue in the future... Hmmm
@_date: 2014-07-27 15:34:44
very true.
If 90% of users are using Bitcoin on their cell phones, then that means that only 10% of the users have 100% of the say on which fork goes where.
Though, we should always aim for not hard-forking.
Edit: for instance I run 7 nodes on VPSes (just to help out the network)... so depending on which version I upgrade them to, I would help decide which fork is adopted more. However, I do not run any SPV server software, so my nodes would not directly affect lite-wallet programs.
Also note: Armory is a node as well, so it would also depend on what rules Armory adopts.

1. This was done to create artificial scarcity, because you had to "trust" governments that they were good for the money they printed. Saying "this is redeemable for gold" was a "trustless" way to create value, as no one could just create gold out of thin air, so no need for trust. Bitcoins are generated at a known rate through cryptographically secure methods (I'll add on this for  so you KNOW they're scarce, no need for trust AND no gold/silver needed. As far as value is concerned, the mining power of the network is backed by trillions of dollars of mining equipment and electricity bills, so this could be equated to gold's value containing the cost of smelting etc.
2. Bankers have the power to create money with the USD through the creation of individual debt. They have no power to do this with Bitcoin, as they can not just create more money by taking a loan with the FED. Fractional reserves led to the Mt Gox incident, and now they are facing legal consequences. If this happened with Goldmann Sachs, they'd get the FED to print the amount of lost money, then pay their big wigs fat bonuses. Bitcoin doesn't allow for that.
3. All bitcoins exist in a "transaction chain" and these transactions are ordered in a "blockchain". The transaction chain's purpose is to assert ownership and validate the coins through traceability back to when they were first generated. If you look at any transaction on the blockchain, every bitcoin sent references a bitcoin received to that sending address. Each transaction is cryptographically signed to prevent tampering (showing the sender verified it) plus the miners who included it in its block verified it (they traced it back all the way to when its bitcoins were created, if invalid they don't include it in a block) and everyone who accepted that block as valid verified every transaction in the block before passing it along. So you have 2 sets of cryptographic functions, ECDSA signatures and SHA256, which prevent tampering once the transaction leaves the sender, and then you have EVERY CLIENT ON THE NETWORK verifying the transaction, and tracing it back to the block the coins were generated in.
4. I mentioned this in  not solely supply and demand, but the mining process costs a TON of money. This cost is embedded in the cost of bitcoins similar to the way the cost of smelting gold is embedded in gold's price. All other fiat currencies have the advantage of having people with guns telling the citizens to use them. Bitcoin, however, does not have this advantage, so currently everyone must convert from their local currencies. As someone who hops around the globe a lot, I think of all my currencies I use in terms of JPY... because that's what my salary come in as. So when I go to the US, I think "ok, this drink is $2, so about 210 yen... sounds like a good deal, I'll buy it" subconsciously. This does not mean the JPY can never be replaced by the USD, it merely means that I receive my money in JPY so I tend to think in JPY. If more people receive their salary in BTC, I'll bet a lot more people will think in terms of BTC. (Though volatility would need to go down first.)
IMO, If you are both engineers, you should be able to understand this video:
This video is VERY GOOD at describing the technicalities of the network. NOTE: He starts with simplified explanations then slowly breaks down his own explanation with "What if?" questions to try and clear common misconceptions, so if you stop halfway through, you might misunderstand what he's saying.
Edit: clarifying some stuff in the video:
1. It says all Bitcoin software downloads all transactions. This is not true for mobile devices and lite clients. They use what is called a merkle tree to verify that the transactions existed in the blockchain without actually having to download every transaction. This is less secure, but still secured by SHA256 that links the transaction with the original blockchain.
2. A lot of people think "if you have to wait 10 minutes, there's no utility." but in actuality, Credit Card payments take anywhere up to a month to "confirm" and at any time during that period if the bank thinks a payment is fraudulent or if the customer claims it to be fraudulent just to scam the merchant, the bank will take back the money. A lot of merchants take this into account (n% of credit card payments probably won't make it through due to customers scamming us) and fold this risk into the prices. Bitcoin lowers this counterparty risk, and once it catches on (or replaces Credit Cards), should lower costs of goods.

Derive means to generate. To create anew one or multiple of something from a single source that is determined by the properties of the source.
This is not true. With BIP38, you must first generate a normal private key completely unrelated to what you do with it.
When you generate a random private key, you could just WIF format it and it'll look like the "5" "K" "L" private keys we know and love, OR you could run it through BIP38, which takes the plaintext private key, protects it with a password, and gives you the password protected key.
From that password protected key, ONLY your password will work with it, and ONLY your private key will come out of it if successful.
"Derive keys" implies that I could just create random keys from one BIP38 key by using different passwords... that's not how it works... it checks the bitcoin address hash as a checksum, so you can only generate one address.
While you're right about BIP38 requiring knowledge of the encrypted key. Saying that that is inferior to the only need being a password for a brainwallet is subjective.
However, the objective truth of the matter is that someone with a rainbow table waiting to run a password cracker can crack any Brainwallet right now if he wants, and if he guesses the password, there is nothing stopping him from stealing the coins. With BIP38, he would first need to physically hold my BIP38 wallet, which is a BIG hurdle. Someone in Russia can't teleport to my house and steal my BIP38 wallet. Then, let's say he did. It will take the same computer over x10000 longer to guess passwords with BIP38 than it will take him to guess passwords with Brainwallet. So lets say my password is the 50,000th password on his password cracker list. If it was a brainwallet, it would take him a second or two to find and steal my bitcoins, but with BIP38, it would take him around 10 hours to get to the same place on his "try these passwords" list.
So like you said, if you're going to do a brain wallet, you must make this super complicated password that you pretty much have to write down, otherwise you will definitely forget it....... at which point, it would be easier to just write down the WIF private key (starting with a "5" or "K" or "L") and have the exact same effect. (If someone finds your brainwallet written on a piece of paper and your WIF private key on a paper, you maybe have a slight advantage of the recognizable 5 not being there... but that's about it.)

When you spend from an address, you reveal a lot of private information.
Though the name seems contradictory, your public key is actually not known to the public until you spend from your address.
Reusing the same address over and over will reveal your public key and a thing called "the r value" of your digital signature.
For normal use, with small amounts, address reuse is fine for the most part, it's only slightly less private.
However, if you are storing most of your bitcoins on an address that has been spent from before, I would GREATLY recommend reconsidering your cold storage strategy.
For instance:
People who didn't reuse addresses were 100% unaffected.

BIP44 needs to be standard for EVERY use case. That's what a standard is.
If ASCII could only support the English alphabet up to the letter X it wouldn't be a standard of letters.
If BIP44 can't have support for any conceivable use of BIP32, it wouldn't be a good standard. Using one seed for multiple coins is a very conceivable use case for BIP32.
That's not the only use case BIP44 enables. If you read into it, the different levels of the chain will denote different things.

Because it makes the binary data readable to the human eye.
one byte is a header which is the same for all keys (hence the 5) and the last 4 bytes are a checksum (so if you mistype a letter it will know to yell at you and say you're wrong.)
Only 32 bytes of that data is actual randomness.
32 bytes is 256 bits, which means a total possibility of combinations at 2^256

You would need to run a server that would check the balances of the addresses on your MPK and know which one to show the user.
In fact, Electrum DOES have a script that does just that... but right now it looks like it's kind of been abandoned. (look under scripts/merchant/merchant.py)
Then all you'd need to do is make a site that would query which address to show. Then maybe a database to store which addresses are being shown to customers. Once a payment comes through, store in the database pertinent info like txid and received amount along with that address and its index number on your MPK.
The major problem would be the server. Maintaining a server is not something that's just a one-off thing... and if you want to use MPK you need to store info about which transaction was with which address, whether it was paid or not. if it was what is the Bitcoin transaction ID etc. all together as separate entries on your database...

That would require a signed, unalterable, transaction == Virtual Currency being "received" in order to transmit.
I would say that nodes don't receive "VC" but rather are merely a messenger telling the network that VC has been transmitted from A to B.
The rule is most likely written for places like Coinbase and Circle. MAAAAAYBE Blockchain.info and Greenaddress.it... But nodes is pushing the interpretation to its limits imo.
I do agree there should be an unambiguous statement that running a node is completely free of regulation. But regulation is the assumption that everything is wrong unless we say it's right... So asking regulators to be reasonable in their interpretations is not prudent.

@_date: 2014-10-19 15:42:47
That is impossible.
The saying is basically a euphemism for "get your bitcoins out of Coinbase / Circle / Bitstamp / Kraken / wherever your bitcoins are stored where you don't have access to your private keys, and move them to a wallet where you DO have access to your private keys."
It is implied in that saying that you know which services give you access to the private keys.

As long as you have never manually changed your gap limit from the default 5, you're fine.
If you have no clue what s gap limit is, you're fine.
Basically Electrum by default says "Generate addresses until there are 5 addresses that have never received or sent any transactions, then stop."
It does the same thing with change addresses, except they only make 3 addresses with no transactions.
If you leave Electrum as is and don't touch the gap limit, and don't somehow independently generate your addresses, a restored seed will find all your addresses.
If you manually generate the 51st address even tho you never touched the first 50, you would then need a gap limit of 51 to find your address.

It's safe. It uses "randrange" from the python-ecdsa library, which in turn uses os.urandom from the python library. (the current windows clients are compiled with Python 2.7)
So if you ever hear a news story saying that Python 2.7's "os.urandom" was broken all along etc. or python-ecdsa's "randrange" was broken all along etc. then you might want to consider moving your bitcoins.
However, the seed that you have is hashed against itself 100,000 times to generate your master private key, so if someone tried to bruteforce the broken urandom to find electrum seeds, it would take him slightly longer, buying time for everyone to move their coins.

If you want to see something done in life, it's fastest to do it yourself.
Whether that be changing the code to show the same address, or just taking the paper wallet, and copying it into a word processor like LibreOffice and copying it until you fill the page... by the time you get anyone to agree with your cause, you could have printed 10000000 backups of your paper wallet by just figuring out how to do it yourself.

Can't wait to see something like this ever play out.
Up til now every hard fork has been:
1. Ummmmm, hey miners... could you please switch to this?
2. Releases.
3. Hard fork
4. Price tanks
5. OMG EVERYONE SWITCH BACK!!!!
6. Price stabilizes.
The p2sh block header vote was an interesting way to roll out a hard fork though!
I wonder if masses of users went with the least mined hard fork, would the users just put up with the slow confirm times... would the least mined hard fork devs manually alter the difficulty to account for the sudden change in mining power? Would miners on the strong chain 51% (or more) DOS the small chain and prevent all transactions to force users back onto the old chain?
These questions make me think that to create a TRUE (Edit: and sustainable) hard fork of Bitcoin, you would need to nerf the double-SHA256 ASICS by changing the algo somehow.

Because the pools won't mine that version, and you will basically roll out a hard fork update that will gain no traction.
Then everyone rolls back, and we're back to square one, and the hard fork scared everyone into selling bitcoin, dropping it $100 or so in price.
Yeah, not much in the way of merit.
The only way to force such a rule would be for someone to 51% attack us. (and I mean ATTACK, not just gain 51% and do nothing with it) THEN roll out an update saying "use p2pool or your blocks are ignored" and all "honest" miners will be forced to mine on the new rules.
Which is why I am in the camp of "bring it on, and let's fix this shit."

If you have large amounts, Consider learning about offline storage with Electrum or offline storage with paper wallets. Try it out first with small amounts to get yourself used to the processes. (This is important, as Aaron points out, it's easy to screw up and accidentally delete information necessary to redeem your bitcoins (because people didn't study enough to know what to be careful of))
I tend to agree with Aaron's assessment of iOS being the most secure platform currently, especially with the iOS 8 inclusion of "no backdoor" encryption. (of course, you have to take their word on it) HOWEVER, if you have the mental capacity and technical savvy to wrap your head around proper cold storage... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! Breadwallet was designed to be able to handle large amounts of money, BUT you are still trusting someone (Apple).
Proper cold storage means you only trust yourself and the blockchain.
Back on topic:
For day to day usage, if you want a web accessible wallet for amounts you'd be comfortable walking around downtown with in your wallet, I would recommend Greenaddress.it. I would steer clear of blockchain.info, not because they aren't secure, but because they are the biggest target for phishing attacks and all sorts of other malware.
Just in case, when signing up for Greenaddress, I would recommend setting up e-mail notifications and have them send you nLockTime transactions (kind of like backups) just in case some day GreenAddress crashes or disappears.
I'm sure Aaron will chime in with some, if not all, of the attack vectors that are possible with Greenaddress, but as long as you are vigilant and separate wallet usage based on the amount of money you are willing to put into it, you should be fine.
If you are the quintessential "layman" and will just derp all your bitcoins into some website and complain when you lose them all, then I would recommend buying an iPhone if you don't have one and sticking with breadWallet.

Check the signature on the builds, then follow the build instructions on your own computer after checking the source for yourself, if they work out to the sane hash and the signature is valid, you're good.
Many developers do this with every new release. So if you see a bunch of smart people up in arms about armory, then maybe I'd stop using it, but as of current version everything is fine.
Verify the signatures though, you might have malware that redirects you to a fake version without you knowing it.

Because no one writes a title saying "old news"
"Breaking" loses its meaning a couple hours after it is released (depending on how new you consider Breaking to mean) but it could be on the front page for days, which by then it will no longer be breaking news.
Then everytime a new visitor to the page sees BREAKING and wonders if the article is about a NEW incident or if its just the same article that they saw already on 20 other outlets.
Plus adding Breaking is just upvote pandering in disguise.

There are two main features in this wallet, when they eventually work like they're supposed to (they're still working the heck out of it, so it's not set in stone yet)
1. Stealth Addresses: Basically, a stealth address is a "dummy address" that is encoded with some other necessary information that the sender takes, and does a math equation with that dummy address and a brand new address made just for the transaction and creates a third address. This third address is known by the two parties, but can not be guessed or calculated by a third party. IN SHORT: Stealth Addresses prevent people who have never sent you bitcoins from seeing your balance.
2. Coinjoin: This basically takes the "inputs" and "outputs" of transactions, and mixes the inputs and outputs of many people into one transaction, so that it makes it difficult to discern who's bitcoins are going to who. Ex. If I gave you a dollar and handed it to you, and big brother was watching, they could track my dollar. But if 5000 people dropped money on the floor, left, and then each intended recipient picked up the amount of money they were meant to receive from the floor all at once, it would be much harder to find out who was giving money to who. This is all done with mathematical algorithms that are open source, so no one is being cheated.
With that said. DARK WALLET IS STILL IN ALPHA DON'T USE REAL BITCOINS WITH IT SOME PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY LOST TONS OF MONEY READ THE FRIGGIN WARNINGS PEOPLE.

In order to be "compatible" BIP39 is not enough.
The BIP32 hierarchy used by the wallet must also be the same. Currently wallets are all over the place. The two main hierarchies are
    m/0'/0/0  &lt; Hive Web, BreadWallet
    m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 &lt; Mycelium, Wallet32, Electrum* &gt;=2.0, DarkWallet &gt;=Alpha 7
* Electrum 2.0 will support importing outside wallets via BIP39... but it will generate wallets with BIP39 phrases with 13 words, using the extra word in a fashion that is non-BIP39 compliant, so Electrum 2.0 generated wallets will not work on any other program.
Also note that Electrum before 2.0 uses a completely different mnemonic algorithm, word list, AND key generation algorithm... People get confused by that often.

I see the future of Bitcoin similar to the current usage of TCP/IP.
99.999% of people who use TCP/IP today use it through "Third-parties" even though the beauty of TCP/IP is the ability for two computers to connect to each other without having to go through a 3rd party. (This was originally attained via calling them up by phone number... which was using the phone infrastructure kind of how Bitcoin uses the internet infrastructure of today.)
I see things like multisig being integrated with hardware/IC chips on cards etc. that the user holds, and a trusted third party holds the 3rd key etc. in case of loss or theft. Then the coinbases and coinkites just play as intermediary... checking against a preset list of conditions to allow transactions and notifying you of attempts to perform transactions outside your set conditions.
If you ask someone who used email in its infancy what they would think if a handful of companies offered free email to the masses, where they would store all info on central servers, those people would probably say "But that's not e-mail, that's just stealing data and privacy invasion. The NSA will just collect everyone's data!" (which actually happened... but besides the point)
If Bitcoin is to involve everyone in the world, then it needs to be user friendly. User friendliness is gained by having a third party deal with the technical parts and just give the user a simple user interface.
I think multisig will allow the GMAILs of Bitcoin's future to create a user friendly service without giving your private keys to the NSA.
Right now, what we need to do is TALK with these businesses to make sure best business practices are utilized. Then we need to INNOVATE. The programmers of the world must create new features for the protocol that enable third parties to offer simple UIs without any need for trust. (ie. A perfected P2P exchange protocol + Google backed UI = trustless and simple P2P exchanges.)
Onlookers see Bitcoin as a bubble about to pop, but Bitcoin as a protocol is just beginning. I have said this before, but I could care less if the price is a bubble or not. The protocol is worth its hashrate in pure gold.

Who says you need to?
We could innovate ways to perform key exchanges directly between friends, similar to the way Facebook let's you friend request and accept requests of each other. We can even do it in a decentralized fashion.
(Try out ninkip2p.com/wallet ... this is sort of in the direction of what I'm talking about)
e-mail is prone to spoofing, DNS poisoning, and a TON of vulnerabilities that are overlooked because "it's just mail." And yet, the amount of people that click on malware infected links that are spoofed to look like friend's e-mail addresses is astounding.
Imagine how fast spam bots would flock to a DNS based Bitcoin?
We need to innovate, not settle.
Right now, the worst thing, address spoof-wise, that is possible is malware that replaces any address you copy onto the clipboard with the attacker's address. This way you will paste their address and perhaps send BTC to them.
This can be solved by looking at the first 3-5 letters and the last 2-3 letters ish just to make sure. Then maybe glance at the rest.
If e-mail existed for bitcoin, they could literally 1 for 1 mimic your e-mail address and have it sent somewhere else.
I am not saying e-mail is not better, recognition-wise, than Bitcoin addresses. I am saying, we need to build off of a SECURE METHOD of accomplishing this. That would mean decentralized, and 100% secure connection between alias and address.
Not to say OneName is a bad service. By all means, I hope they succeed. But I also hope that people don't settle for OneName and give up on 100% reliable lookup technology innovation.

to OP: I highly recommend against embedding data in the blockchain, it's not cost effective.

Ok, then bring it on. We'll fix it and be stronger for having the experience.
Trust me, whenever anything happens in Bitcoin, panic sellers are abound.
I think that this current hubbub will die down, then after the next bubble, the major pop (china FUD for the last bubble) will be a wave of new investments coming into GHash.io tipping it over 51%.
Millions of new people that flooded in during the bubble who don't really understand what's going on will not bother understanding what the technical implications are, just gauge the consensus on reddit / message boards, and then when they see the price dropping they'll sell too.
Then all the panic sellers will leave, and we'll settle again. And hopefully by then we will have dealt with the 51% threat once and for all.
Then the next bubble will bring another growing pain that we've known about but didn't want to risk a hard fork to fix it again, rinse and repeat.
Basically, the Bitcoin protocol has gotten so conservative with hard fork rollouts that we NEED these catastrophic events to push us to evolve.
There are solutions coded for a 51% attack, waiting to be rolled out if the shit hit the fan. We just don't roll them out because we don't want to hard fork unless we absolutely have to.

This. blockchain.info's wallets are not deterministic, AND your json wallet file is protected by two passwords.
(Your main password decrypts to a public keys decrypted private keys encrypted file. Your secondary password decrypts those private keys, but only AFTER you've cracked the main password first.)
Your backup only contains the keys you had at the time of backup. So if you have a weak password, change it. Then after changing the password(s) create a new address, send all your coins to it. Poof, now you have only your two passwords to trust. 2FA is still a good way to protect getting onto your web account tho, so I don't recommend disabling it.

Just make the transaction so that the sum of the outputs is exactly equal to the sum of the inputs.
Oh... you mean "How do you send a fee-less transaction with a one button easy click User Interface that makes everything easy?"
I think the easiest way is:
1. install electrum using the "install version" not the portable version etc.
2. Find the install folder with all the source files. (Note: I am not talking about the folder with wallet files and whatnot)
3. go to &lt;installfolder&gt;/lib/bitcoin.py and open it in WORDPAD or whatever text editor that supports Lf line breaks.
4. find this (line 635) `MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 10000`: 
5. change it to 0 and save the file.
6. Start Electrum, and set preferences "fee" to 0.
Be warned, 0 fee transactions take a while to confirm... sometimes days...
Do not post to help forums if your 0 fee transaction gets stuck. No one will be able to help you.

* Bitcoin is a payment network with its own currency, bitcoin.
* The payment network, Bitcoin, has no central authority controlling it, and it is controlled by a protocol similar to the one that controls the internet.
* The innovative aspect of the Bitcoin protocol is the way it limits supply and prevents the same bitcoin from being duplicated at the same time.
* Bitcoin is a peer to peer network. This means that there is no way to shut it down completely. As long as one computer running the Bitcoin Core software remains, it can repopulate the network easily as long as there are willing participants.
* Bitcoin is open source. This means that everyone can see everything about how it works. If there was a problem or someone was gaming the system, everyone would know within a matter of minutes.
* Bitcoins can be sent across the world in any amount for pennies.
* Bitcoin is an open protocol, so no one can refuse you access to the Bitcoin network.

I think the "Bankless" is referring to the disenfranchised population of the world that is not able to hold a bank account.
Aka, the bankless population.
Even if all the first world countries ban Bitcoin, it will shine in the countries where a bank is not something everyone can use. Bitcoin is a tool to help the economic growth of people who normally could only do business in local fleamarkets.
You could buy goods from rural farmers in some small country without having to go to some market run by some organization that brings the goods to you.
The internet and cheap smartphones have risen greatly in these countries and de-facto currencies like the M pesa are basically the same concept except with central authorities.
I have always thought that if the M pesa spread around the world, the third world would catch up pretty quick economically.
Bitcoin does it one better: even if the M pesa organization fails, the Bitcoin network won't.

If you're aiming for cheap, you'll have to have 100% of the functionality of the Trezor. A tall order to fill tbh.


To be honest, there is no point to this if the wallet will require an NFC connection to make a transaction (if you don't, the offline wallet can make transactions based on invalid transactions / there is an attack vector now)
If you want to lower price, keeping the device to signing only will be critical.
Also, QR codes for txes will be difficult on any device with a screen smaller than 3-4 inches. The larger the TX size, the less able the screen is able to display the QR code properly... this will increase cost way too much, so NFC only or maybe Bluetooth if it is cost effective.
One other big point will be having apps out on launch that actually work. Android, iOS, PC, Mac, etc. (iOS can use Bluetooth)
And these apps should implement SPV mode... as MyTrezor being on a centralized server has proven to be a flop as downtime sucks.

If you are sending over 576 BTC total (including change) where no outputs are smaller than 0.01 BTC and the transaction is less than 1000 bytes large, it is impossible to require a fee.
You could pay one if you wanted to, but you would never have to. 
Edit: the calculation is
    (10,000,000 satoshis x 144 blocks) / 250 bytes
This works out to 5,760,000.
Any transaction with no output less than 0.01 BTC, less than or equal to 1000 bytes, and a priority rating of 5,760,000 or over will require no fee.
Assuming your transaction is 250 bytes, 1 BTC that was confirmed 144 blocks ago (approx. 1 day) requires no fee.
If we say it was confirmed in the most recent block, and assume your transaction is 1000 bytes exactly. You would need to send 576 BTC to not require a fee.
If you hold 0.5 BTC for two days with 250 byte tx, same thing

Let's put aside the 51% attack is a real danger or not argument and point out a FACT.
1. The theoretical (or real) threat of the 51% is talking about someone who holds 51% of the HASHING POWER. aka, if the whole network is 100 petahashes, they much hold more than 50 petahashes per second of mining power.
2. The chart ( that everyone always posts ad nauseum when 51% attacks happen DOES NOT REPRESENT HASHING POWER! IT IS NOT IN ANY WAY RELATED TO HASHING POWER! IT IS JUST A PERCENTAGE OF THE LAST X BLOCKS AND WHO MINED THEM!
To give an example: We know mining is a luck game. Let's say I am the God of luck and I mine 144 blocks within 5 minutes and I release my 144 block chain onto the network.
Because the "24 hour" pool chart is just "percentage of last 144 blocks mined by who." The chart would instantaneously say "100% kinoshitajona"
Obviously I don't have 50 petahashes, I'm just the God of Luck.
IN THE SAME WAY, SOMEONE WITH 38% COULD BE JUST UNLUCKY AND STILL HAVE OVER 51% OF THE MINING POWER!
The "last x blocks mined by who" is an OK estimation, but let's get real, IT'S AN ESTIMATE. People watch the thing like "the SECOND it goes over 50% I'mma sell all mah bitcoins!" when in actuality, that is the dumbest thing ever.

But they're proportional to the number of users. If my LN service settles once a week and 7 users sign up, I can stagger them to settle one of them every day. But if 604793 more users sign up. I would have to settle one user every second.
So we're still just kicking the can down the road, just in a different way... not to mention we're also introducing large amounts of complexity to a process that is already complex.
Explaining to a newb to write down their BIP39 phrase, oh but don't screen cap it... oh and if you add an optional passphrase, no wallet will tell you your passphrase is wrong, because every passphrase is right and creates a hidden volume, oh and by the way you need to print pieces of paper with QR codes to store bitcoins securely...
Imagine how things will be with Lightning: All of the above PLUS "oh and by the way your browser/app will store these things called nLockTime transactions when you open a channel and these are crucial to keeping control of your own funds so don't lose them, but you will prolly be using multiple hubs at once, and if your device explodes you won't have your ticket to holding the hub accountable anymore so be sure to back it up with a USB or in your email drafts or evernote or something."
I'm sure they'll iron out details and figure out ways to make all this super easy while still being trustless... but they haven't.
If we sit on the current network for 3-5 years while they work on sidechains or what have you, then Bitcoin will have lost pretty much all value and come around full circle to being a niche technology with 100kb blocksize averages. Then Fedcoin / Ripple-bank will take over because they scale.
A lot of people say "boohoo, 20MB people are afraid of their investment losing value!" but imo I think the bigger threat is "while Bitcoin is in 'oops transaction backlog of 50,000,000 transactions, estimated 1st confirm for 1 BTC fee ($5) = 2 days', Fedcoin / Ripple-bank can render Bitcoin irrelevant with a scalable centralized network."
That's what worries me most. Along with "What if the federal reserve just printed money and used it to buy OTC bitcoin by the busload and ran a spamming attack like the stress test the other day... except 24/7..." but that's a little more far fetched.

All addresses are available on the Receive tab at all times. Old addresses with 0 balance require you to click a button to show all addresses... but it doesn't force you to rotate.
An alternative is Hive... but Hive for OSX doesn't let you create new addresses. You only get one, forever... unless you completely delete your wallet and start from scratch.

BIPs are not for the reference client. BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Protocol and is (supposed) to be a universal set of standards for Bitcoin devs.
The idea being, if I used BIP38-ish encryption and just change one parameter because there was no BIP, then you might implement it in a different way, then when we try to match our methods, one of us will have users with old versions getting errors and posting threads online saying omg I can't decrypt my key gaiz.
BIP is optional, sure. But HIGHLY recommended to follow any BIP that is related to what you are trying to do.

Except, if you attack Bitcoin to the point where you solve 100% of the blocks, bitcoins will be worth nothing overnight, so you are earning 3600 BTC /day worth $0.


Again, no. I will touch on one of the many solutions proposed to solve the 51% attack if it ever becomes a problem. tl;dr: "All the good miners would just update to a new version, and the mining power of the attacker will be useless."
In order for someone with a majority of the mining power to mine every block consistently, they must use the attack method known as "selfish mining." This differs from "chance mining" attacks.
Chance mining would give someone with 60% of the hashing power a 60% chance of solving the next block. This means the transaction they are trying to double spend etc. could get spent while they're waiting for product to ship or waiting for the correct number of confirmations, so they don't want this.
Selfish mining with the majority gives you statistically a good chance to replace the main chain with a longer chain periodically for extended periods of time.
Imagine the whole network is 10GH/s and you attack with 11 GH/s. If you mine the main chain, you have a 52% chance of mining the next block. But if you mine your own chain and don't broadcast any blocks. You are hashing 10% faster than the main chain... this means that once you get your second or third or fourth block, you will eventually (statistics wise) have a longer chain than main chain. You broadcast your chain, and main chain gets replaced. Repeat ad nauseum to own every block in the chain.
The solution to this is simple. Tell the program "when replacing a short chain with a newly found longer chain, only do so if the sum of the priorities of all transactions in the chain are larger than the shorter chain's." the priority value is what determines whether or not your transaction needs a fee or not and it has to do with the age of the coins used and their value.
A selfish miner will be mining alone, and can not include transactions from the outside, and even if they did somehow create some crazy bridge connection and manually transfer over transactions and whatnot, you will eventually get high amounts of transactions referencing confirmed transactions in the main chain that you have not yet confirmed, so it would be near impossible to get a chain with higher priority.
The reason why this change is not added now is because it would cause a hard fork, and hard forks are tricky to roll out...
A hard fork under a 51% attack would be easy to roll out. "add this feature, or be on a crashing ship and lose all your money's value"
The attacker, with no logic and only a desire to see Bitcoin crash and burn would see Bitcoin panic, the price would take a significant hit... but once the hard fork rolled out, the attacker would be out hundreds of millions of dollars with almost nothing to show for it, except for the street creds. "lol I wasted money and crashed Bitcoin for a while, yo"


I'm sure some big bank with investment firms could try to 51% and then short Bitcoin... but now you're going back into the realm of "ok so in order to do this, I need to short Bitcoin enough to realize a profit of hundreds of millions of dollars (and growing daily)..." the books don't add up.
Though I agree with you, once wall street gets in here, there will be smaller attacks to try and short Bitcoin... but a 51% will be the least cost effective, and trust me, wall street would worry about cost effectiveness.

1. Open source
2. Single Purpose hardware
Apple's security model relies heavily on "hide everything so they don't find out how it works!"... then people poke and prod... until they find out how it works, and people realize how unsecure it is.
However Open Source security can not rely on "hide it so they don't know where to attack" they must rely on "build it so it can not be attacked even if the attacker knows every single piece of code and what every part does." Because they leave everything in the open, security is a NECESSITY and can not be replaced with "hiding" as a security method. (like Apple)
If there was an exploit in the Trezor source code. It would be attacked by now and make big news here on reddit.
This is not to say that Open Source projects are immune to attack vectors. OpenSSL's "Heartbleed" bug is attribute to that. But because of the way the USB interface interacts with the chip containing the keys, it is near impossible for someone to access your keys.
One thing to always be vigilant for is Client-side attacks. ie. someone installed malware on your PC to replace any Copied Bitcoin addresses with the attacker's address, so when you paste it, you will paste the attacker's address and not the one you copied. (This type of attack happened with some malicious Chrome extensions)
tl;dr Trezor is MUCH more secure than Apple, because Apple relies on security through obfuscation.

If you're hiding something from an organization with billions of dollars in resources, using the strength of magnetic polarity of each bit to recover (or guess billions of combinations using super computers) the 1s and 0s is not too hard when you can hire forensic scientists in clean rooms with super computers at hand. Because of this, multiple rewrites with specific overwriting hard drive wipe algorithms is what the US government uses.

    print checksum
You need to use .decode('hex') to turn the string of hex numbers into a binary hex string.
Also, using .digest() returns the binary string for the hash, and .hexdigest() returns the human readable hex string, which is why I used binary for the inner and string for the outer.
Also, the [:8] will only show the first 8 characters of the string (so the first 4 bytes of the checksum) but if you keep it as a binary string you must use [:4] (because 1 unit of a binary hex string is 1 byte, not one character)

You can not attach a message to a transaction in the blockchain.
The only messages you can attache to transactions are the one's blockchain.info allows, the ones that are stored locally on your computer, and the ones that are sent out by merchants who use BIP0070 merchant protocol.
Any other "message" will not be recorded in the blockchain.
There are ways to "encode data into the blockchain," but there are no wallet clients that perform this nor decode this type of info.

However, Armory is not made for the average user. It is also not made for the casual user.
In fact, even out of the people who USE Armory, they only want "Experts" to mess with this feature.
The thing you're looking for is things like copay, Dark Wallet (This one will have the BEST multisig UX imo, as it will generate a p2p connection with the other parties.), etc.
Armory has always been about "place as many hurdles as possible to make you stop and think every step of the way. This way your bitcoins will be secure."
Also, the files he was saving externally were not sensitive or critical. No bitcoins could be stolen by intercepting those files. If someone tried to load the lockbox file, they'd just see 3 addresses, and see that they don't own any of their private keys. If they stole the incomplete transaction, they would only see a transaction that has one sig out of two, and what address it's sending how many bitcoins, but the person would not be able to do anything with the transaction to steal bitcoins.
Anyone using Armory to do mutli-sig will probably be the type of person to encrypt e-mails with pgp or something, so that should help.

They can definitely choose to not broadcast a block they made. Say they were mining a block  after block  If they mine  before anyone else, it puts them over the 50% of last 144 blocks number, and they don't want that... But they solve block 
They can, if they so wish, decide not to send the block they solved to anyone, and wait for someone else to solve  then start mining off someone else's  In the meanwhile, they keep their miners busy just mining the old  as if they hadn't found it.
Normally, this would make no sense to do, but getting 51% would lower the price, thus lowering their profits, so it could definitely happen.
The "what percentage of last 144 blocks was mined by who?" Way of calculating estimated hash proportion is bull.

What you want is "EC Addition"
You can't multiply two points in EC math, only "add"
You can multiply a NUMBER and a point.
Any EC added points have the private key equivalent to the sum of each of the public points' private keys mod the order of the curve.
So where capital letters are pubkey points and lower case are private keys. (G is the generator point)
    P + R + E = A mod N
    pG + rG + eG = aG mod N
    Remove common G
    p + r + e = a mod N

The password will generate a separate wallet.
To visualize, the phrase "ball back butter" with no password will generate the first address of 1ABC, but the phrase "ball back butter" with the password "a" will generate the first address of 1uEa.
You are not password protecting the wallet a la encryption. You are "salting" the wallet, so that a criminal could figure out your seed and it will generate a valid wallet (which you can send dummy funds to) and unless he knows your password he won't be able to find your REAL wallet.
 is pretty much all you can do... Also you don't need to use new recovery words, just the same recovery words, but this time "recover" with the password you want to use. (every password will generate a separate wallet) Then send the coins to THAT wallet.

I was not aware that rush wallet's first and foremost priority was to promote brainwallets. If so, I wonder why they chose random letters and not randomized grammatically correct sentences, etc... interesting choice.
Because I was under the assumption that the primary usage was "save it as a bookmark, and you've got a wallet ready anywhere your bookmarks are... AND as a *bonus* you can pop that high-entropy (178 bits) seed into a brainwallet site to recover funds whenever." where I viewed the browser-but-local-key feature as 99% main, and the restore-with-brainwallet as an added on bonus.


This is the solution I think should be taken, and will be eventually, I hope.
This was one of the controversies in the early stages of BIP39 as well, the iteration count was first proposed to be very low to accommodate for mobile devices, and it was originally going to have every combination be valid (similar to electrum's mnemonic function). Now It has increased a slight bit, but slush has stated on Reddit before that they might only allow 256 bit seeds for trezor, as the 128 bit seeds with the current iteration count isn't good enough. (I guess so, if you're talking millions of dollars in cold storage, sure... but bread wallet etc. are fine with 128 bit)
I hope brainwallets find a better way to get secure...


I agree, this is something that should be done. One way to delineate which users are using user generated keys or not is to use the checksum method I mentioned above. Anyone with an invalid checksum gets a prominent red warning every time.
If I were to get everything I wanted, a check for containing words like "password" or "love" or "1234" etc. will add "DETECTED WORD COMMONLY USED IN PASSWORDS" etc.


Yes, I guess so. Especially considering the whole "bookmark it" main pitch of the site. People who made the keys previously would just be bookmarked to their v1 keys.
Overall, I think the site fulfills the promises it sets out to do. (I only just realized that the brainwallet usage was the main push, and that was a misunderstanding on my part.)
If I were to change two minor things... 1. mouse/tap entropy from 30 chars to 43 chars to bring it up to 62^43 which is slightly over 2^256 and 2. increase the minimum key size from 26 characters to a higher number... at LEAST 29 ("correct horse battery staple" is one of the most used/stolen brainwallets our there and it's 28 characters.) if possible 35 or 40 chars... ("donkey raven pineapple mango butter catfish" is 43 characters, for reference.)

You have never read the dev mailing list, have you?
If Bitcoin were a top-down company with one guy or one group of guys calling the shots, shit would get done.
It is because of the fact that all pull requests from ANYONE (including you or I) gets sanity checked and reviewed before a decision is made, and these decisions are open to debate to anyone with a free github account, that the development of the core protocol tends to get left behind.
Not to mention that 99% of one time contributors create new code, but never review other people's pull requests or help make test cases, so there's a disproportionate amount of shit to check and test, and basically the core dev team checks and tests most of the time.
If you truly want a democracy, learn how to program and PARTICIPATE. They won't stiffarm you or block your opinion or anything. Heck, don't program? Then look at the discussion threads on the github pull requests / issues and add in your two cents.

3. Revisit my 1.9.8 stealth send commit. (local repo) Think to myself "well, if I don't get it in now... who knows when."

Obviously from the interviews from CEO of Overstock, he ideologically thinks that the world should move in the way of bitcoins. He is merely putting his money (profit margins) where his mouth is.
Like you said to the layman it's a gamble. I agree.
Similar to how I could gamble on my favorite basketball team, by gambling on them I am aligning the incentive structure with theirs. I now not only want them to win just because I like them, but also because I have an "investment" (from my pov) in them. Objectively it's a gamble, but subjectively, it's an "investment."
In a similar way, someone who feels strongly about their church can donate 50% their salary to it in hopes that their churches ideas spread around the world. Someone could donate money to a charity in hopes that the idea behind the charity gains traction and their priorities are reflected in service to their fellow man.
In the exact same way, one can view bitcoin as a solution to many of the worlds problems, and in order to not just be "all talk" they can actually put their money where their mouth is and "invest" in it.
If you think it's a gamble, you're right. Go ahead and live your life free of Bitcoin.
If someone think's it's an investment, then it is to them. Telling them you think it's a gamble with most often then not just get you A. ignored or B. have people equally bored as you are to go back and forth with you.

The idea behind responsible disclosure is that:
- There is an issue which may currently be causing harm to users / the owners.
- Disclosing that on an open forum before the owners can fix it will only alert more hackers to its existence.
- The balance between letting the public know, so they may take steps to protect themselves, and letting the owners fix the issue is not a cookie cutter thing that is always good to pick one over the other.
So while we can't know the total number of people that were harmed before you posted, harmed because of your post, or saved because of your post, I CAN make an educated guess that if 1 user saw your post, they would protect themselves (1 account)... Whereas if 1 hacker saw your post, he could potentially harm multiple users.
So in this instance, I would lean towards your irresponsible disclosure causing more harm than it helped.

"Imagine a ledger where everyone knew everyone else's amounts. Any transfer of amounts requires a signature, and everyone can verify everyone else's signature. Then imagine that these people are all given Sudoku puzzles to solve. The first person to solve the sudoku gets to choose which transactions are added to the ledger next. This prevents the same person from adding fraudulent transactions because he can not reliably solve a sudoku puzzle faster than the millions of others trying to solve it."
She then looked at me and said "Why bother? Doesn't a bank do all that for you?"
I then said "Yes, mom. Banks do that everyday without a need for Sudoku puzzles or anything... but they also destroy economies, so it's a trade off."

1. last I heard, Peter Todd was talking about (finally) getting around to writing a BIP.
2. Currently the only wallet to support USING (aka receiving) a stealth address is DarkWallet. However, I have modified 1.9.8 of Electrum to allow sending TO stealth... but RECEIVING to stealth requires a lot more information which is currently only being gathered by Dark Wallet's obelisk servers. (also open source)

The debate would come down to one thing:
The purpose of the blockchain.
I personally think the SOLE purpose of the blockchain is consensus.
Having a 500kb block with 100% of it's tx outputs completely used up is no longer doing any good to the network except being passed around when users first sync.
I say that block would be fine as just a header on the network, seeing as the header is all that gets hashed anyways, and we can still connect the chain before and after it with just the header.
If you think some sentimental "historical history nostalgia book" is a purpose, then you might disagree.
ie. the 10,000 BTC pizza tx, if all utxos in it are used up, should be pruned and I have no qualms with that.
I think there will always be people disabling pruning and keeping all txes for the sake of historical blah blah.

What ever happened to only throwing away all txes with no utxos and keeping only headers for blocks with 0 utxos and necessary merkle branches needed to reconstruct the merkle root plus the txes with utxos in them.
So this patch just snips entire old blocks?

My response:
1. You don't. Even the exchange that is allowing the author to "accept BTC" is actually taking the BTC and giving the author the fiat currency equivalent of that amount of BTC at the time of purchase. This eliminates all risk but the risk of trusting that the exchange will actually pay out your fiat to you. (most places do daily deposits, and almost no one has large daily volumes of BTC transactions, so if they're late a day, stop accepting BTC for a while claiming technical difficulties, worst case, you're out one day's BTC sales, aka not much) Also, if volatility of bitcoin was a concern, well then I guess we shouldn't invest in crazy volatile ideas like Twitter or Facebook during their infancies.
2. Yes, bitcoiners use cash. But to say that means your market share would be the same either way is ridiculous. Think about it on a micro-scale, people who own and use a fair sum of bitcoin (aka not simple hoarding investors) obviously view Bitcoin as a better payment method. If they are offered one service which requires living near his office, driving down there, pulling out their credit card, taking the risk of their credit card info being stolen etc., and then a competitor offers the same service accepting bitcoins and allowing them to do it all from home. A person who USES bitcoin will obviously choose the second firm. As a personal anecdote, I have switched businesses I normally use for bitcoin accepting businesses on more than one occasion. Over the last 3 months alone that put those businesses out of a total of about $3,000 of my money and gave the bitcoin accepting businesses about $3,000 extra. (as I wouldn't have used them otherwise) Notice I say dollars, as all the businesses use exchanges that instantly convert to USD for them. What volatility?
3. Notice the wording here, it sounds like bitcoiners have nowhere to use their coins and are begging and pleading with anyone to accept their bitcoins. Businesses in hard times only accept it to grab some extra income to stay afloat, etc.
I wouldn't call it pandering, it's called "fulfilling a need" and that's what any good business does. They find an audience with a need and fill it for profit. Your word choice shows your anti-bitcoin bias and lowers your credibility.
4. You make it sound like he told everyone to "stop all cash and credit payments and only accept bitcoin, oh and don't convert to dirty fiat money harharhar" but that's NOT what he said.
He merely said "hey, there's a new market of people who prefer businesses that accept bitcoin, AND you don't even have to hold bitcoin! they'll instantly convert to fiat for you!"
No one will be "back to fiat." We're already "in" fiat. The point is we're trying to get OUT.
When I hear such blatant bias filled comments that don't even understand how bitcoin works, I cringe at the psuedo-intellectual hipster fiat-thumper logic.

Unfortunately, Bitcoin doesn't see amounts when it calculates fees. It sees amounts when it calculates priority. If your priority is over a certain amount, the transaction is less than 1000 bytes and all outputs (including change) are more than 0.01 BTC, then you don't need to have a fee at all.
These amounts were put in place to protect against spam... not to mention the 0.0001 BTC fee was placed back when 0.0001 BTC was WAAAAAAAAAAAY less than a cent.
Since then, the minimum has been lowered to 0.00001 BTC, so 0.006 USD at current price. But since less than half of the miners use that version, more than half the miners will see any transaction using that amount as "not enough"... so Multibit decided not to lower their fees as well to prioritize user confirmation time.
If you must send a low/no fee tx, Install electrum, find /lib/bitcoin.py and edit it in wordpad, search for "MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE =" and change the 10000 to 1000 or 0... (this number is satoshis, so default is 0.0001, setting to 1000 would be 0.00001, etc.) save the file and then use Electrum from now on.
However, no fee txes will usually take hours to days to confirm. Why? Because the mining side of Bitcoin is running a muck. It's a huge money grab and no one gives two shits about the health of the network, so they'll mine blocks with a pathetic number of transactions. like 24 or something, just so their block propagates faster.
The awesome utility phase of bitcoin won't come until transaction fees can overtake block reward as the priority incentive for miners. Then they will want to fill their blocks to the brim, and it will become a supply / demand curve for block space and transaction volume.

Coinbase takes a couple weeks to get fully verified, plus you must connect and buy from your bank account and receive the payment before you can verify your credit card for instant payment.
Circle can get you $500 worth of bitcoins within 2 minutes of signup via credit card.
No requirement of connecting bank account, which means non-US residents can use it if they stick with credit card.
It's also got a much more simple UI. Circle is geared towards people who don't know much about BTC, and Coinbase has special option menus with advanced settings and address control and blah blah... but to be honest, people who know anything about BTC aren't using Coinbase to store anyways.
tl;dr Circle is much easier to buy BTC with.

If Cex.io were using their power for other pools, the pool operators would decide what transactions are included and reject any blocks generated by their members that were fraudulent / with incorrect transactions.
Not to mention you can't selfish mine through a pool.
If Cex.io suddenly goes offline for a period of time and suddenly the hashing power of the network drops like 40% overall total... then I would say we're screwed. because it would mean they took their power out of all the pools and started selfish mining in hopes to create a chain that is longer than main chain.

Pretty much the only way change addresses can "get you" is when you mix wallets.
ie. You generate a paper wallet with bitaddress.org... but then you import it into Electrum... but then you export an address from Electrum into another wallet etc.
A normal person will think of each address as having a balance, and sending from that balance will just lower the balance on that address... when in actuality, most wallets empty the address completely, and then send the unsent balance back to another DIFFERENT address managed by the wallet.
it is because of this that someone might import an address into Electrum, spend from it, then delete the electrum wallet... only to find that his change bitcoins actually went to an address controlled by Electrum, and NOT the paper wallet.
Because he deleted the Electrum wallet, he has now lost his coins.
The best advice is to stick with 1 wallet (like breadwallet or Electrum or Armory), and backup whatever phrase or whatnot in a very safe place.
I think breadwallet COULD be a good idea for a hefty amount of funds... but knowing the way a normal user wants to use their phone (ie. reuse PIN codes and use birthdays etc as PIN codes for ease of remembering) I wouldn't exactly place your life savings in it.
Every time you type in your PIN, someone could be watching you... so it would be best to store your "life savings" in a wallet you seldom use. And just like you don't invite people off the street to walk in and view your safe deposit box with you, DO NOT access your cold storage in public... The mycelium swipe to pay thing is nifty, but don't carry your life savings on a paper wallet in your back pocket... seriously.
Heck, I was actually thinking of using an old iPod with Breadwallet for my cold storage solution... but it doesn't support iOS7... and I don't want to buy another expensive iDevice.

It only occurs 1/256 hard key derivations.
So every time you make a new wallet there is a 3/256 chance that your copay wallet will not match up with others.
253/256 chance that your wallet is fine. If you derive separate accounts from your phrase (Which Copay doesn't support inside a single wallet, you can choose which account to use with the wallet though upon wallet creation) each new account will be another 1/256 roll of the dice whether you are affected or not, but the day to day address generation and change addresses will not affect you.
tl;dr it needs to be fixed and the rate which it occurs is still high enough to warrant warning messages for affected users, however, you as an individual have a one time 3/256 chance roll of the die of being affected.
Using Trezor etc. with copay is not affected.

P2Pool doesn't decentralize anything if 1 node gets more than 51%.
I understand what you are TRYING to ask:
1. What if we made it so that mining was REQUIRED to use P2Pool?
The answer is: It would change nothing. GHash and everyone else would switch their operators to P2Pool, and all their hashing power would go with them automatically. (Seeing as changing the operator's mining code doesn't really affect each miner in the pool)
Also, here's a hint: If someone does a 51% attack, that is not good for Bitcoin at all... even if someone goes on record to say "oh yeah don't sell all your bitcoins, we're just going to centralize the network real quick so we can DEcentralize it later, mmkay?" it will show that a large number of miners could easily collude to do whatever they want to the network, and thus anyone would look at Bitcoin and think "but Bitcoin has a community of miners that easily group together to move hashing power for political ideals at the drop of a hat... hmmm, sounds like the government. No benefit to Bitcoin, I guess."

The only information you have given so far is:
1. You are using electrum to receive money
2. You are using a server or some kind
3. You are using ruby (just found out right now)
All of your questions can be answered with "whatever you make it."
The logs I am talking about are logs that you should be making.
The requests I am talking about are the requests I assume you are making (because every single person I know who uses electrum on a server creates requests for payment)
The fact that you are asking me "what requests?" Confuses me greatly, because I have no idea what you are doing, and every time I think I have a vision of what you are trying to do, then you ask me a question that shows me that you couldn't possibly be doing what I thought you were doing.
Could you explain in technical detail exactly what you are doing, in what programming languages, on what systems, for what customer, for what service, how payment flow happens, and how you want to check it.

What are you quoting? I couldn't find the paragraph you pasted in either of the two links posted.
A digital signature is two values, R and S.
R is generated by multiplying a random number k with the generator point of the curve and taking the X value.
S is generated by the double SHA256 of the message being signed, the random number k (from the R step), the x value of R, and **the private key expressed as an integer**.
These two values are placed in the signature, and to verify that the owner of the public key associated with that private key actually signed it, you need:
the R value from the signature, the S value from the signature, the public key of the signer, and the double SHA256 of the message being signed.
Then you take the multiplicative inverse of S, and multiply it with the double SHA256 of the message, as well as the R value.
You take those two numbers, and the former, you multiply with the generator point using EC multiplication and the latter you multiply with the public key point. The two resulting points are added using EC addition and if the resulting point's x value is the same as the R value in the signature, the signature was definitely generated by the private key associated with the public key you used to verify.

Could be measured pretty easily by looking at the percentage of utxos in the last x blocks subtracted from 1 to get the number of utxos in all blocks besides the last x blocks.
If you have a running full node you have a database of all utxos sitting there on your computer. So it shouldn't be hard to analyze.
Just don't really think many people view it as a useful metric, so no sites I know of have this info readily available.

I see Multibit-HD is actually a non-BIP44 compatible wallet that added the BIP44 hierarchy only (I guess to aide in recovery of Trezor without the device if necessary) instead of respecting the gap limit and all the other provisions of BIP44.
I guess this makes sense for them, as their wallet is not BIP44... so it wouldn't follow the rules.
As far as what to do... the only thing I could say is to send a few bits to the addresses in between until Mycelium sees all the bitcoins you received...

Multi-sig escrow.
A company like Greenaddress (who can not spend your bitcoins of their own accord) could accept a signed transaction from you and move one of the outputs to a separate address on your chain and then hold that partially signed transaction from you. While at the same time preventing you from using it. Not showing it in your balance etc.
Then if you want to chargeback, and say I was frauded by xyz on ebay, they would just destroy the partially signed transaction and allow you to spend it again.
ALL reversible transactions that exist in our world are ONLY reversible because we TRUST in a third party.
Your bank, paypal, etc.

Imagine this:
You run a huge business with hundreds of people on a floor sharing one printer.
Mr. A goes to print his document for a meeting in 15 minutes. The Printer says "oops, sorry, the RAM is already filled with Mr. B's high resolution images, please wait your turn, then try again!"
Or what if while waiting for his document to queue in the line, the power goes out. RAM isn't persistent, so all documents in the queue are gone. Mr. A, being the bright gem of genius he is, closed the document without saving! Oh no, let's sue Canon!
What about IT security? Some companies have software on every single piece of hardware in their company to monitor what their employees are doing for compliance reasons... they must also have a record of all documents printed in order to know if someone is violating compliance with their printed documents.
THEN, add the fact that most people think that "clear cache" buttons ACTUALLY delete information.
It's not false advertising, because the definition of "deleting" a file is "to remove the file header so that computers can not run the file.
What the forensic guy did in the video was run a program that looks at every 1 and 0 on the hard drive, and estimates what was a file and what wasn't.
This method usually produces a bunch of broken files that can't be viewed, but a large portion of "deleted" files actually still exist in 100% integrity on the hard drive, and are just marked as "free space" instead of being marked as "abc.pdf"
To combat this, you much spend a couple hours writing and rewriting random 0s and 1s to every bit on the hard drive in order to safely dispose of it.

If anything has the maximum amount of entropy possible in Bitcoin of course the amount of time to guess the key is the same. But the point is:
1. Human generated 160 bits of entropy is near impossible without losing the purpose of Brainwallets. (To remember the password)
2. Machine generated 160 bits would defeat the purpose of using brainwallets. (Note that BIP39 and other mnemonic encodings are NOT brainwallets, and both BIP39 and Electrum implement anti-brute forcing measures in the algorithms themselves.)
If you want to say "well, if I have 160 bits of entropy than I have just as much security as any other method so there." Then fine, but again... defeats the purpose, and you're better off just writing down your private key directly.
Also, if you use some sort of memorable phrase and run it through a program that replaces a with 4 etc. then you don't really understand what entropy is.
First rule of bitcoin security, don't assume the best outcome when comparing security models. As entropy decreases, the difference between security models differs with greater variance.

I wouldn't even really call it a checksum, really... it's about as good as the verification digit on credit cards. (in fact, CC is better if BIP39 is less than the "minimum" 128bit entropy ) With 128-bit, there's only 4-bit checksum, which is a 1/16 chance that it'll work out anyways if you just randomly slap words together. 1/256 chance if you use 256-bit. (Which is a lot better, but still not really a lot of protection)
The main selling point of BIP39 is that the seed is not dependant on the wordlist... meaning that I could generate a BIP39 seed from a wordlist only I have, and if I put it into your implementation of BIP39 it will get me to the same seed.
The reason for this is that BIP39 specifies that you hash the seed phrase, and not reverse the encoding process.
Currently, implementations are all over the place (understandably so, as saying "we have a checksum!" on one hand and "but don't bother looking at the checksum, just run it through pbkdf2 and you're fine!" on the other leads many to wonder "so should I check the validity of the seed or not?") and I think most of them are on the "check against English wordlist and throw an error if it's not valid."
However, theoretically it should be a great way for managing things when localized wallets need to speak with each other. I just think most devs are in English speaking countries and no one is thinking of other languages because there's no official wordlists on the BIP page besides English.
Also, BIP39 has other features that are hinted at, such as the wordlist having "the first 4 letters of every word is unique" so apps could auto-complete the word for the user based on the first four letters.
I think one of the dangers with large word lists is that similar words end up being in the list, and you increase the likelihood that a user would accidentally mis-write their seed down and enter in an incorrect seed that generates an empty wallet.

You would have to generate a BIP39 phrase with a checksum.
That would need to be done with math that you can't do on paper.
The reason why they made the BIP39 protocol like this was to SPECIFICALLY PREVENT users from making their own phrases. Why? Because users are bad at creating entropy, and anyone that has an understanding of entropy will probably know how to fire up a python console and run that entropy through some hashes and convert to binary, then split into 11 bit segments, converting each segment to decimal to find these words.

- Paypal integrates bitcoin and allows withdrawing from bitcoin funds for legacy monetary payments.
- Google Wallet does the same / something similar.
- Mt. Gox's stolen funds are somehow returned to every user / a plan to return all funds to every user is set in stone.
- Another bank crisis in some European country sparks a rush of newcomers buying up bitcoin left and right. Bulls follow suit.
Then of course, there is always imminent threats of tanking to 0.
- major flaw in secp256k1 is found, and top 100 balance addresses are all stolen from at the same time by the attacker.
- China says anything regarding bitcoin, is poorly translated.

Wow! I just saw the new sticky. Much better than the old one.
One thing I heard a lot after the tipping the other day with Microsoft peoples was "OK, how do I get the tips from ChangeTip and use them to pay for something on my Xbox One?"
Adding a section called "How to use Bitcoin once you have it" explaining a lot of conventions might be a good idea.
(ie "QR codes can be scanned with mobile wallets (recommended!!) and make sending Bitcoin easy." iOS = breadWallet, Android = Mycelium, etc. Then maybe mention "For desktop wallets, there are links that will automatically bring up your bitcoin wallet program, but a lot of the time you'll have to copy and paste the address... be sure to check the first few characters AND the last few characters to make sure a virus isn't changing the address while it's on your clipboard.)
Of course you don't want to make it too scary, and maybe it might be best just to recommend mobile wallets first, tell them to write down (on paper) the backup phrases, and tell them to scan QR codes when they need to spend...
Also, add Green Man Gaming to the spend bitcoin section (as a lot of gamers probably joined)... as well as Microsoft :-)

So the original OP did this:
1. Created password protected rushwallet
2. Got tired of typing in password... rather than generating a new wallet, he just decided to use his encrypted wallet as an unencrypted wallet as well by removing the encryption flag and using the ciphertext as his entropy input (aka brainwallet)
3. Posted his wallet from  online thinking he was safe due to password being strong. Completely forgot about wallet  being exposed by this. Maybe he forgot he even had any money in 
4. This thread's OP stole his coins.
This reminds me of the recent Mycelium iOS debacle where 40 people were affected by a horrible bug. When asked if any of them had phrases, 3 of them had written down the recovery phrase.
Hearing stories like OP and the Mycelium thing... I seriously wonder: If veteran bitcoin enthusiasts can't be their own bank then how is grandma going to be her own bank?

That is wrong.
The public key is a specific point on the curve, and positive/negative y matters.
If y didn't matter, the public key would be the same size as the private key.
If I took the reference point and scalar multiplied by my private key, I would get a definite plus or minus value from mirroring the result on the y axis (this is the rule of elliptic addition that allows it to be communicative)
To get the point mirrored on the y axis, I would need a completely different private key to create the line necessary to make that point.
Unless the reference point was y = 0, then the negative value of my private key would produce the negative value of my public key's y value.

The 12 word phrase is basically a master private key for all your private keys until the end of time.
Even if you figure out how to export private keys from that phrase, be warned that BIP32 private keys can reveal all of the other keys if leaked, which is why most BIP32 wallets don't allow it.
If you ever figure out how to export your private keys or master public key, just know that you should treat each one of them as sensitive information.
Combining the master public key with one of the private keys will reveal the master private key.
I know it all sounds scary, but that is in fact WHY BIP32 HD wallets should only allow the seed (12 words) to be handled and treat it as one big private key.
If you must generate an individual address to give to someone, or for paper wallets to give away, DO NOT give away addresses derived from your seed. Generate a new one with bitaddress etc.

Overstock gives BTC refunds at the price at time of refund.
If you bought a $50 item when BTC was at $500 per coin, you spent 0.1 BTC. Then if you get a refund when it is $5000 per coin, you will only get a 0.01 BTC refund, because it is $50.
If I buy something with my US credit card in Japan, they convert the USD from my account into yen and withdraw that dollar amount... But if I make a return and get a credit, they convert the credit back into USD at the rate at time of refund.
This is because the refund's value is pegged to the priced value. Since the BTC value is calculated at time of purchase, that means the priced value is USD. So the refund will also be priced in USD, regardless of whether they return it as BTC or not.
People who have never left their own country are not used to this, I'm sure... but this is actually the norm for using other currencies at a specific store pricing in a certain currency.

Double spending would mean sending a transaction to A for amount x, then sending the same amount x to yourself, or B, or whoever, and having both transactions be valid.
This did not happen, as the malleable transactions were merely the same amount x being sent to the same address A, they just changed the transaction number associated with it.
If the altered transaction number got accepted first, the bitcoins would go through to A just as intended. The problem arised when Gox used ONLY the transaction ID to notify themselves of a transaction going through.
This was utilized by attackers, who would withdraw z amount from their account to their external account A, then, when they see the unconfirmed transaction from gox address G to their A for amount z with the transaction number 1, they change the transaction number to 2. If 2 went through, no double spend was made, as the intended recipient received the intended coins.
However, gox would only look at transaction 1, see it failed, and they would calculate in their systems as still owning coins z. Obviously, when they try to send coins z to a different person, it fails. The network sees it as an attempt to double spend, people freak out, and the attacker was trying to contact support saying "I didn't get my coins!".
How many people were able to get gox to send them coins twice due to Gox thinking the original transaction failed when it didn't? I don't know. But even if just a few people succeeded in tricking gox, that's their fault and not the bitcoin protocol's fault. The issue was known for 3 years.

While you say this in a pessimistic frame of reference, I believe the same thing, but in a optimistic frame of reference.
I tell people "invest no more than you are willing to lose, then use it as an opportunity to participate in an open source project, learn programming languages, learn how money works, think about how a system like Bitcoin could (or couldn't) change the world."
This way, even if you lose your investment due to a crash etc. then you at least have knowledge that you didn't before, like how to code in python or C+, how to use github, how fiat currencies work, how trading markets work etc.
To view Bitcoin as "a monetary loss or gain" strictly is short sighted and immature.

My thought on the issue:
1. There is a problem
2. We need to fix it within about half a year, give or take
3. Sidechains are waaaaaaaaaay out into the future before being a viable solution for Bitcoin in particular
4. Lightning Network also waaaaaaaay out into the future.
If you'd like to push out sidechains by March, by all means go ahead sir.
Meanwhile, I'll be paying $1 fees on $2 transactions wondering why I still use this thing.

I tried it just now in various states.
It seems that I get instant shut downs when my trezor has been wiped. (aka no private keys in it) but all other states work. (has private keys without PIN or passphrase, with both, and any combination of the two.)
Which OS are you using?
Another thing you could try is this:
1. Enter Mytrezor
2. Click the Trezor name and go into advanced options.
3. Click "Encrypt with passphrase" or "Disable passphrase" (if you have one set)
4. Confirm on the device.
5. Reconnect the device.
6. (If originally was no passphrase) when it asks for the passphrase just insert nothing and click "next" and it will load your wallet again. (an empty passphrase and no passphrase setting are the same wallet).
7. (If originally was a passphrase) Go back into the advanced setting and enable passphrase again.
8. Unplug, plug back in, and log in using your passphrase.
See if this will reset Mytrezor into not being dumb.
Enabling and Disabling encryption will not wipe your device at all.

Easier solution:
If a pool mines over 72 of the last 144 blocks, they must pay every block reward they receive to p2pool until they only have solved 57 of the last 144 blocks... Which if they solved no blocks after hitting penalty, would take up to 6 hours.
Any pool that gets CLOSE to 73 blocks will have miners leave IN DROVES!
Any pool who doesn't pay to p2pool all rewards after hitting penalty and before falling to 57 shall be seen as malicious.
No way to enforce this... But mining pools need to do something like this to prevent majority shares.

Here's how the address display algorithm works?
Does it have a history? (Send or receive transactions)
Does it have a balance?
If Yes, then No: hide under "used" tab.
If Yes, then Yes: show receive tab or change tab
If No, then No: show under receive tab or change tab. Then lower the gap value by one for the respective tab.
Then once the gap value hits 0, it stops showing addresses.
Default gap value is 5 for receiving addresses and 3 for change... So you'll always see 3 fresh change addresses and 5 fresh receive addresses at all times.

"ideas" men were usually the guys who ran projects in my company that failed.
Every successful project I have ever participated in had a dev with lots of experience of actually coding for similar projects as its head.
If you go into the project with a bunch of "ideas" on a whiteboard and ask the devs "how do we do this?" then you're going to have a bad time.
Project lead would need to think out a roadmap before hand and the kickoff meeting should be "I am planning on utilizing this library, because it is under this license and is available for commercial use, it also has these functionalities which would be useful for these features. We plan on finishing this much by this timeframe, this much by this timeframe, etc. and I think if we split up these different features in this way (tell them each their duties) we can make it in time. What are your thoughts?"
Then even un-experienced devs can say "well I think this library is better" or "do we really need feature x?" or "can't we code feature y in python and use abc to interface def" etc.
If someone comes in and says "ok dev guys, how do you want to code this project?" You will almost REQUIRE a leader type dev (similar to the guy I explained above) who is willing to take a leadership role and not be recognized for it. (the plague of old fashioned company structure) But those people are rare and far between.
Unless you are someone like Steve Jobs who has a genius friend who is willing to slave away for you because he "just likes tinkering with stuff" and give you all the credit, I don't think your proposal will gain traction.

You should make a snooty paper explaining how cyber bullying and spying are actually a good thing.
Any teacher who assigns something with a bias "write an essay why xyz is bad" is a shitty teacher. I feel sorry for you.
That said, here's some pluses and minuses to Bitcoin (the payment network) and bitcoin (the currency).
Major Problems:
1. Human beings have 10,000s of year of experience with physical security (guards with guns in front of a vault) but only 20 some odd years of experience with digital security. This means only a small percentage of people would know how to properly protect their private keys (the thing you need to spend your bitcoins).
2. Bitcoin is the first payment network in existence to manage assets digitally with fungibility. Because of this, there are still occasional bugs that are found and exploited to steal bitcoins, etc. Not to mention that bad people who hold bitcoins for their customers could just lie and say "there was a bug in Bitcoin and we lost all your money" when in actuality they just stole their customers' money.
Major benefits:
1. Most people in the world can not have a bank account due to many circumstances, and Bitcoin allows them to store value in an account that they control and they can send and receive to and from anywhere in the world. This means a farmer in Africa could sell goat pelts to manufacturing plants in the US directly, increasing economic growth in the developing world.
2. The money supply is managed by an algorithm and not by a government. Some people view this as a bad thing, but there is a school of economic thought known as "Austrian Economics" that believes a limited money supply is good for the economy.
3. Banks don't give accounts to kids your age, but with bitcoin you could draw a picture and post it online and potentially have people tipping you real value without permission from any bank.

This term is confusing for a lot of people. Be more specific.
Would you say Coinbase and Blockchain.info are both "online wallets"? If you don't know much about bitcoin, yes you probably would.
However, Coinbase controls your private keys, and Blockchain.info only stores your encrypted private keys for you (so it's easier to gain access to them from multiple devices).
That distinction can only be made if you know how certain sites work, can read the source code if any is released, or know someone who does know how certain sites work.
tl;dr tell us the name of the site.
In general, assuming you created the wallet within the last year or so, if the site asks you to "write down a 12 (or 24) word phrase" and makes a big deal about "DON'T LOSE THIS PHRASE KEEP IT SAFE!" then those 12 words are all you need to gain access to your bitcoins.
The 12 - 24 word system is used by most wallets on PC, mobile, web, and other places, to store your private keys... those 12 words ARE your private keys in a literal sense. The website is merely giving you a nice interface that is easy to understand so you can USE that 12 word phrase to receive and send bitcoin.
Some super old sites have their own non-standard phrase algorithms, though... which brings me back to my point: tell us which site.

Well, yes... but that assumes the RAM of your Android phone is a dangerous place to store sensitive data.
I guess for me, that logically means that if I value the bitcoin on that paper wallet more than I value my phone number address emails and all of my friends phone numbers etc... then I might shy away from it.

You take the entire supply of sidedoge and divide it by 100,000,000. Then you get the value of one satoshi in sidedoge.
You are basically just dividing up that 1 BTC, and at any point you unpeg a portion of the BTC, the whole value of the sidedoge system is lowered by the proportionate amount redeemed.
Think if it like pre-1975 America.
Claiming to back with gold reserves on the one hand and printing funny money on the other.
Not a good idea, but possible.
Edit: Also btw, a bitcoin based currency can't have "infinite" units... it would be limited to 92,233,720,368.54775807 x number of coinbase transactions (blocks) as that's the highest number an 8 byte signed integer can represent in satoshis (0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) so you would take the total supply at time of unpegging, divide by 10,000,000, and you would need at least that much to unpeg 1 satoshi on the main chain. Then once it's unpegged, the rest of the SIDEDOGE will just continue on its inflation spiral, next time someone wants to unpeg, they'd need to divide the whole supply by 99,999,999 to unpeg 1 satoshi and so on.
I could peg 1 satoshi on the main chain and use it to create a continuously inflating currency with 465789 block reward, and if I could get people to believe in it like people believe in the USD, it won't matter if it has 1 satoshi backing it. HOWEVER, having more BTC backing it will give people more confidence in the currency, and they can actually go and independantly redeem the BTC if they want, proportionate to their share of the whole currency.

    Included with this message is a csv file with each address above paired with its signature. The message to verify is this message starting with "Addresses owned" and ending with "END"

My answer was "it doesn't matter."
I assumed the OP agreed with me.
I just added the "on the off chance that you MIGHT think that Bitcoin will tank, you better sell now, because selling high is what you do when you think it's just going to tank from here on out."
Another good practice is to not bother yourself with the news / happenings of something you are sure is a bad investment. You will only reaffirm your beliefs at best and tempt yourself to get back into it at worst. The risk versus the return is very high when you follow news on an investment you gave up on. It's like an old girlfriend, you'll be tempted.
The last part was tongue in cheek. (as noted by the smiley) but the second to last part was sincere. On the off chance that he sincerely thought Bitcoin was going to tank, but then later down the road he changed his mind, then we will welcome him back with open arms.

You could do that. Make your own bitcoin on two shitty laptops and mine 600000000 bitcoins a second.
However, those bitcoins would not be recognized as valid on the public bitcoin, and would only be valid on your private bitcoin.

Yes, this would be a good link for OP to include.
Back on topic: tl;dr the malleability fixes absent would mean that you essentially have to open two unidirectional channels for each single bidirectional channel on a segwit based LN.
Not being able to outsource this anonymously does not necessarily mean that it "requires a full node" though... you could have a service that sends you an email when it sees a specific input being spent on the blockchain, and you could then open up an SPV wallet and punish it.
I would like to see more info on the "requires parties to have their own Bitcoin node" part in specific.
@_date: 2017-02-26 00:42:33
This primarily has to do with the history of how electrum works.
originally there were no bloom filters to use on bitcoind
and once bloom filters appeared, the other wallets started using them for SPV (to connect directly to nodes) but electrum was created before that so it had to create its own structure to create an SPV wallet
Switching over to a bitcoind only solution would be easier now because of the -addressindex option added to bitcoind... BUT Electrum has added so much extra to the Electrum server (encrypted label storage for users, partially signed transaction relay storage for users, etc) that in order for Electrum to go only bitcoind, it would need to lose multisig and lose labels, and possibly other features (I haven't kept up)
Bitcore is the only other solution that comes close, but it also has extra overhead.
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:28:11


While you're right, the difference of having to generate a BIP32 master key and then check the major branches (currently only really 2... like for Trezor `m/44'/0'/0'/0/0` for breadwallet, Hive-js, etc. `m/0'/0/0`) is almost insignificant.
If you could write your own wallet, or customize your wallet to use a specific hierarchy without open-sourcing and revealing your hierarchy... that would be awesome... but then you'd have to backup your BIP39 seed AND your hierarchy.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:18:48
You can actually do it from text in the format above.
no quotes around the address, remember to include the 0 before the decimal, separate each address/amount line with a carriage return (CRLF to be exact, that should be default unless you're using some special OS) Edit: and no space after the comma.
Also, when using the csv input format, it automatically includes a fee that is = to the fee you have set in your settings menu, so make sure that if you're trying to use up inputs exactly, that your sends + the transaction fee adds up to exactly the amount of total inputs you'd like to spend. if it's too much with the transaction fee, it will give you an error I think, or if you have any leftover inputs, it will use one to pay the fee, and then create a separate output to send to a change address it your change address pool.

if only 20% of the mining power mined the losing fork, then it would take them about 50 minutes to mine a block whereas the winning chain would take about 12.5 minutes.

@_date: 2015-05-11 00:06:15
A bloom filter is kinda like telling the node "hey, I only want transactions that when you hash each individual output has at least one hash beginning with the bits 0100."
So you get TONS of false positives from the node, and the local client just deletes the transactions not relevant to the wallet.
breadwallet's variable false positive rate is set pretty high.
Also, the peer seeding process has been changed since the Jan Moller nodes incident to include 5-10 different sources and also checks recent peers to make sure you aren't being tarpitted (just given the same list of peers by a large group of nodes controlled by one person.)
It's not perfect by any means, but then of course, neither is Bitcoin Core, nor is Mycelium. tbh if I was primarily an Android user I would pick you guys hands down, maybe once you get SPV + tor into iOS I might switch, but breadwallet is the best choice in my opinion for iOS.

While Lightning is great, it doesn't exist yet, and requires hard fork changes in the Bitcoin protocol to support it.
We are heading towards a ceiling in about one year's time. If we hit that ceiling things could get pretty bad... or they might not. Who knows.
I think that increasing the blocksize as a temporary bandaid just in case Lightning has unforeseen issues while at the same time implementing all the necessary changes to implement Lightning is the best course of action.
If Lightning works, the transaction rate should plummet to 100kB blocks or something, and reducing the limit again should be no problem as people will unanimously agree that all is well.
And in case Lightning flops, we have some breathing room to hold us off until we find our NAT to Bitcoin's IPv4 problem.

95% of miner support is needed.
We could have 99% community support, but it doesn't matter unfortunately.
I agree with hanakookie that if there was some un-cheatable way to gauge the support of the whole community, it would be &gt;95%.
Edit: However, he is also right that if 99% of the community supports NOT hardforking and refuses to upgrade, miners would be mining a worthless fork, as their hard fork would not be able to send to or from exchanges, or be accepted by any merchants or individuals... They could throw a hissy fit like a 5 year old and use their 95% to attack the 5% minority chain, hurting people's ability to transact on it, semi-coercing them to move... but the old nodes could just as easily hard fork off onto a different algorithm without ASICs. However, this whole scenario is pretty doomsday-esque and will tank bitcoin's price like never before... which miners don't like, so they won't try it. They'll just keep buying sock puppets until the community gets stockholm syndrome and agrees with whatever they say.

If your kids have androids, Electrum sounds like a good idea.
You can backup your kids' seeds, and even load their seeds onto your own encrypted wallet on a separate computer, giving you access to all transactions and ability to move all BTC. Just remember to keep your computer safe and virus free.
As far as daily limits are concerned, I could add a crude feature to it for you if you're willing to learn enough python to verify I'm not cheating you. I'll even tell you where to paste it into the code.
In order to do it remotely, you'd need dedicated servers that were setup to store and push the info you send to your kids' phones... I'm sure you don't want that.
As far as major wallet including such a feature, I don't think it will be out for a while. I believe users with similar use cases like you are either too few, or too invisible for devs to take notice.

using a payment processor like gocoin or bitpay or coinbase will allow your customers to pay for your services from anywhere in the world.
If no one uses it, there's no cost to you, except the 5 minutes it takes to set up an account and maybe the 10 minutes it takes to add the payment page plugin to whatever payment system / website html code that you are running.
But when someone DOES use it, you'll get 99 cents on the dollar, compared to credit card's 4% + 40 cents fee. Not to mention cryptocurrency has no charge backs. So there is no credit card fraud.

Paste these formulas into A1, B1, C1, and D1 respectively, and then select "A1:D2048" and hit Ctrl+D to paste the top 4 formulas down all the way to the bottom of your selection.
Then just copy that whole area and "Paste values" to get a nice list of all possible combinations.

"Why do we all have to get vaccinated for the measels?! It's so paranoid, why doesn't the government just get rid of vaccination requirements as I'm pretty sure we can trust that no one has it in this day and age."
Sure, you might be able to squeak by trusting 100 nodes telling you the same thing as being trustworthy, but that's only true because each node has meticulously checked and verified all the rules against all transactions and blocks.
What if you were victim to a sybil attack, and 80 percent of nodes you were connected to were actually just one server behind 80 proxies telling you lies. 80/100 are saying it, so it must be true, one might say.
This also ignores the fact that having a single hash of block.dat folder would do absolutely nothing to help you verify or even lookup which transactions are related to your wallet.
At the very minimum you would need to download all the blockheaders, load bloom filters, and use getblocks to find your old transactions.
If you assume the wallet is new so it won't need to check previous blocks, then you basically have the SPV verification on startup pull request currently awaiting merge on master.

All the more reason users should move away from SPV / 3rd party validation and validate the whole blockchain (run a full node).
If a hard fork seems imminent, the major wallets will take a populist attitude and try to support both chains and/or the one that "wins out," but as long as you are the one deciding which rules your wallet follows, no one can force you onto a new blockchain.
One very good way to do so is running Bitcore with BWS installed. This allows you to use Copay with your own personal full node directly.
Also, I believe Bitcoin Wallet for Android lets you identify an IP address of your own node to receive your transactions from iirc.

People thought MtGox failing would destroy Bitcoin.
People thought Neobee failing would destroy Bitcoin.
People thought the bug that created billions of bitcoins out of thin air would destroy Bitcoin.
Being in the Bitcoin space for a long time, you tend to overestimate Bitcoin's resilience, because you've seen it "die" so many times before.
I personally think that gaining 51% of the hashing power is totally possible, and in fact, I would like to see someone try.
The Proof of Work system has yet to be put to any REAL test as of yet, and a crazy not-profit-driven multi-trillionaire attempting to destory Bitcoin would be the perfect test.
Of course, that would kind of be like hoping I catch the bubonic plague, because if I survive that, my immune system is going to be super strong!
Not to mention that 99% of all planned fixes to deal with 51% attacks would greatly lower miner profitability, so it would be near impossible to implement those hard forks without a catastrophic event at hand.

This makes a lot of assumptions:
1. You only have one picture of your grandmother and one picture of your cat.
2. These pictures are stored in the same state they were when the address was generated.
3. None of the metadata of the images was altered in any way.
But if you mean that ANY picture of your grandmother and ANY picture of your cat could generate the address. Then no, and even if you managed to get such awesome recognition software as to tell your grandmother and your cat from every other grandmother and cat, then the amount of entropy gained from your "grandmother"-ness and "cat"-ness would be much much less than the first method, AND if someone knew your grandmother and cat, knew you cared about both of them, and knew about this magical wallet that used ANY picture of things to make bitcoin addresses, an attacker could just steak out your house, take pictures of everything related to you and try them all against each other.
So in short... it would not be a realistic option.

This can not be overstated.
If someone is targeting you because they think you have a shitton of bitcoin, they're going to watch you by any means necessary until they can ascertain with high probability that you have x bitcoins.
Then they pull out their wrench, AND the hidden surveillance data showing you opening a wallet holding 5000 bitcoins while connecting your Trezor to your PC and fiddling with it.
If you reply to that with a dummy wallet, bye bye knee caps.
The only people who get relief from such a feature are people who are careful not to leak any info on their wallet balances. OR people who get mugged by some dumb people on the street. OR people who are ordered by a court to give up "their password" ("a password" in reality)

Electrum contributor here:
- The 12 words are used to mask a random number. The same words will always generate the same number. The words just make it easier to remember than 34982376501265043605726340586208346501673405136457861083460 etc.
- This random number is put through a process called a "hash algorithm" which takes any information as an input, and always puts out the same length output as a large random number. However, if you input the EXACT SAME DATA into the function, the exact same number will come out. AND if you change that input just a TINY BIT. ie. "Hi buddy!" &gt; "Hi, buddy!"... then output will be COMPLETELY different and completely random (meaning you couldn't tell that the difference of the two inputs was a comma.
- After running it through the function, that number is used to generate a public - private key pair just like a normal bitcoin address.
- BUT, with electrum, it uses an interesting property of Elliptic curves that states that any two points (public keys) that are added together to make a third point can calculate the private key of the third point by adding the private keys of the first two points.
- using this, electrum generates index points that correspond with a numeric sequence, so if you put in 0, it gives you one point, if you put in 1 it gives you a completely random different one.
- These are mixed together with the first public - private pair that you created to generate your addresses, and the private keys can be mathematically derived with 100% certainty.
- upon restoration, the electrum wallet generates your master keys, then starts generating index points for 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. in order... and keeps searching for transaction history. It will keep generating new addresses in the same order you did while using it... until 5 FRESH addresses are found. Then it stops looking. This also ties into the next point.
- Electrum displays 5 non-used addresses at all times. so if you send bitcoin to one, it will generate a 6th one, so that at all times 5 FRESH addresses are on the screen. This is for the case when you want to give out more than one address at a time. Electrum 2.0 will have a better GUI handling of receiving addresses and invoices.
- If Electrum could just generate at-will, whenever... then Electrum would have no idea how many addresses it needs to check before giving up when restoring the wallet from your 12 word seed.
tl;dr ELI5: 12 words represent a number. that number is added with 0 to make your first address, 1 to make your second, etc... because the same words always work out to be the same number, and adding 5 and 1, for example, is always 6. You can be certain that your addresses can be regenerated. Simplifying this process makes it sound unsafe, but it is safe.
To explain how this is safe is impossible to do ELI5.

This is suuuuper simple. Took me about 20 minutes and haven't really tested, but tried it on my iPhone 6 and besides Javascript being slow, it works. (it took me like 20 seconds to do 20 addresses each)
Basically, just paste the xpub master public key in there and it will automatically generate the number of addresses for both receive and change that is written in the second box.
I could add other things like manually choosing a starting point so you could count 10 keys starting from your 120th key etc.
you can also edit the large text box so you can select and copy the addresses.

A bitcoin escrow provider could hold for 6 months and jut pretend like the funds are sent (like a credit card does) but they don't, because the type of user that currently uses bitcoin despises the idea of chargebacks, both as a spender AND a merchant.
Visa could basically take over bitcoin, make it centralized and scale well, and offer practically the same services they do now except using bitcoin + escrow as a backbone, having escrow release be the point of no return 6 months later... but they have no reason to.
In the same reason bitcoin could bend and twist itself to create a pseudo-reversibility of Bitcoin that would function just as well, but again, we have no reason to do so.
The argument that one is better than the other is irrelevant to bitcoin, as we can mimic the other side if need arises.

From Japan here.
I know Asia is probably not your main demographic, but at current price, bits is actually closer to my own currency. When it was $1000 per BTC, that made is almost exactly 1 bit to 1 KRW, and 1 bit to 0.1 JPY.
Since I visit Korea a lot, it was very easy for me.
I think this issue is such a bias related thing... many people on this forum against it say "oh well bits is bad because it's not close to my currency of choice."
I am for bits because it discourages unit bias... where as putting "milli" on the beginning of it just makes users say "What's milli mean?" (USA) or "Oh, so 1 bitcoin would be 1000 times that. Wow that's way too expensive!" (everywhere else)
Seeing as the code of bitcoin deals with everything in satoshis anyways, the "bitcoin" construct is completely a societal thing, and should be destroyed. NOT just slapped with a "milli" and say "SI units because lol"
Since "bitcoin" is already so ingrained with the "100 million satoshis" amount, we need a new name that is at a lower amount of satoshis with a new "name" of its own.
I have no attachment to the word "bits" itself, but I like what it is attempting to do. Rebrand Bitcoin with a cheaper value so that people don't feel so intimidated. Like a stock split.
Since we already have a hard time explaining "Bitcoin with a big B is the network and protocol, and little b is the currency." we should just get rid of little b from the nomenclature all together.
But that's just my two satoshis on the matter.
Either way, great app guys!

As long as you pay the fee like everyone else, embedding hashes into bitcoin is fine.
Anyone telling you otherwise is just trying to discourage competition for THEIR transactions' space.
However, whether or not it is economical for you to pay 120 satoshi per byte to embed your hashes is a different discussion, and we can't answer that for you.
If you believe Ethereum's blockchain is secure and irreversible, then they are probably cheaper than bitcoin to embed data right now.

Nope. When the guy made it, there was no value and people just mined it and sent it around back and forth for no reason.
The first time bitcoins were ever exchanged for anything with value was on the bitcointalk forums in 2010. A guy said he'd give 10,000 bitcoins to anyone who bought him two pizzas. Some guy used online pizza ordering and their credit card to send the guy his pizzas for about $40.
Little while later Mt. Gox allowed the trading of bitcoins on their site for real money.
So the answer is no. The creator did NOT create bitcoin "to get rich"
He created Bitcoin as an experiment to see if digital assets could be managed on a p2p system without a central authority.
The USERS gave it value.
However, you are right in that I could copy paste Bitcoin's code, make a new coin called "Gigacoin" and tell everyone to use it... But whether or not I get rich depends on how many people buy it. And if I wanted to sell a bunch for a huge cash in, I would most likely destroy the market for the coin.

If I could sell 5 cheeseburgers for $2 each, but if I lowered my price to $1 I would sell 50 cheeseburgers... should I lower my price?
The answer: no one knows. Sudden production increas of cheeseburgers could destroy your existing supply chain to the point where they will no longer produce ANY cheeseburgers, and you will have 0 income and an expensive hunk of machinery sitting in a factory doing nothing.
OR everything goes swimmingly and you make a killing on the cheeseburger market.

Which is why I think Bitcoin Payment Layer\* (BPL) tech will be instrumental to allowing coffees and "huge deals" to coexist just as we allow a lease for a dinky apartment and a contract for a land title of billions of dollars to coexist in the judicial system by having two parties sign a contract and only bring it to court when something goes wrong.

This is great, but one critique (which I have encountered when trying to recommend something similar to a company) is that the day-to-day (withdraw, deposit, check) operations need to be either one of two things:
1. Only possible to do the right way.
2. Done in such a way that no wrong way exists that would lower overall security.
In the end, no matter how much a company or a CSO understands the risks of each decision in how to perform these tasks, eventually these tasks will need to be delegated to people who have less understanding, and more workload outside of these tasks which they believe should be simple.

Copay has the obvious advantage of querying a full node directly using an integrated API.
blockchain.info could also technically do this, but they're blockchain.info.
Copay has been working hard to fully inform the user of any wrong-doings that might happen, and with the new push-notification API added to bitcore-wallet-service on git, hopefully a notification can be sent via push to notify users of fraudulent activity.
However, Peter's point is dumb.

That's known as "child pays for parent" where you would actually re-send the unconfirmed BTC that they sent you back to yourself, but add double fees. Any miner with the child pays for parent patch on it would then confirm both the transactions as one lump and count your second transaction's fees towards the parent (the one they sent you)
Eligius mining pool does this, but I think they got rid of their public API a while ago.
The only thing I would ask you:
If the person was paying with credit card, would you wait for 3-6 months before VISA settled and actually gave you the customer's money?
If you've never accepted credit card payments before, let me just say that if you're dealing with small items, just ship the item / let them download it whatever, and if you start getting double spends, assess your risk verses chargeback risks on credit cards.
If your business is so on edge that having a $5 coffee stolen would put you out of business, then payment methods and settlement are probably the least of your worries.

To further prevent a 50% attack.
Who benefits from newly minted coins? Miners?
What do you have to be doing to do a 50% attack? Mine.
It's overkill, but the idea is, they don't want a miner to spend newly mined coins, then receive whatever goods in exchange, then double spend by creating another blockchain thats 2 blocks instead of 1.
Even with 50% of mining power, you would need to maintain that 50% for 33 hours 20 minutes. In the meantime blocktimes would double as the attacker would have to make a 101 block chain to beat out the 100 blocks til the coins clear.
This greatly decreases the chance, and cost benefit balance of a 50% attack

Hint: Electrum, even if it was just a portable exe file, will not make using Trezor any easier than MyTrezor... in fact, if anything it's more difficult. Electrum always has been lacking in the UI department.

Name benefits the Bitcoin blockchain minus mining has that an SQL database storing arbitrary hash chains of data commitments doesn't.
If by "blockchain" all you mean is "chain of groups of data organized into merkle trees that perform hash commitments dependent on the previous group" with no mention of consensus algorithms, then it begs the question: Why blocks, then? Why merkle trees? Why not just entries on a database?
Hand waving and "oh blockchains are useful without mining because reasons. You just don't understand" won't fly with me. Give technically specific details of the benefits and explain why they can't be done with any old DB.

Bits is more responsive because it is programmed in a language that Android can understand. However, some of the more advanced functions that were in Address have yet to be included in Bits, so they left Address up there until they can finish moving all the functionality to Bits.
btw, Address is actually an app inside an app. A native Android app that uses a web viewer to view javascript is used to read their Javascript app (the backend was reused from their web-client)
Not a huge difference, but for slower phones, you will notice a huge difference.

Please note that this post is old.
The offline wallet no longer requires that the address be shown to sign it.
ie. if you spend bitcoins from the 32nd address, but the offline wallet only shows 5, it will now sign using the 32nd private key perfectly fine without needing to generate new addresses.
I would like to reiterate. OP is saying he wants to record the private keys individually... This is dangerous to do, and defeats the purpose of Electrum.
I highly recommend against touching the offline wallet unless you are signing an unsigned transaction.

You have a looooot of 0 confs. This means the later transactions are referring to the change you sent to yourself in previous transactions.
Miner's lower the priority of transactions that make large chains like this. The last transaction needs to wait for every transaction before it to confirm, and a lot of miners would think twice to add your 8 transactions all at once. (when I say think, it's prolly just some priority algorithm)
If you have a thing that requires 1 conf, try sending to it and waiting til the conf before sending again.

(Also, as a specific note: My usage of the inputs for the dice etc. is exactly what you state; I convert the base 6 number generated by your aggregate dice rolls into a large binary number and slice that into 11 digit chunks and convert those chunks into a number between 0-2047, selecting the word with those numbers, then adding the checksum and choosing the final word...
I am trying to imagine the use case you are describing... are you looking at creating like an x page list of all words and which dice combinations the user would roll to select them or something?
In that case, you should make a list from
1-1-1-1-1 up to 5-5-3-4-6
just counting up and once you get a list of 2048 possibilities, start over and line up the 2049th possibility with the 1st, etc.
Then place each word in order next to the 3 columns of possibilities.
If they roll a pattern that starts to "go over" 5-5-3-4-6 aka rolling a 6 off the bat, or a 5-6 or 5-5-4 or 5-5-3-5 etc. Tell them to start over for that word, re-rolling from the beginning.
If you don't have them re-start rolling, you'll:
A. have to teach them modular arithmetic
B. have unbalanced bias for the first 1632 words. (they will have 4 possibilities each while the rest have 3 possibilities each)
Then once they get 23 or 11 words, I could make it so they input 3 coin flips (for 24 words) or 7 coin flips (for 12 words) or something to decide / calculate the last word.
My schedule is about to get busy, so if you want it in a timely manner I would recommend asking soon.
Let me know if you have any questions in general. I answer those for free :-)

You make it sound so easy, but this is just asking for trouble. Set the gap limit too large with too low a false positive rate, you're losing privacy. Set it too large with a high false positive rate, you're stepping closer and closer to a full node (bandwidth-wise) on a cell phone, yikes. you set the gap limit too low, and users will not be able to independently restore their funds if over the gap limit amount of their friends have never actually sent them bitcoins. (I consider having to write a post to github / wherever to find out what to do to not be "independent")
tbh, I am all for the idea, but whether it be github, bitcointalk, or whatever, it can only practically exist with centralized services.
However, I think that until we start having storj based web servers that serve up a decentralized github and whatnot... bitcoin is never going to be "truly" decentralized. Because as much as transaction data and small 40 byte chunks of public data are awesome, most services require entire databases full of user metadata to function.
I would like to see this service where all the metadata and friends lists were indexed with your xpub's fingerprint, encrypted by your xpub using ECIES and stored on a database served through storj etc. Then decentralized backup restoration would be super easy.
In the meantime, NinkiWallet is a pretty good substitute. xpub exchanges are encrypted and signed using PGP keys so you know that your xpub you received from your friend is genuine.

If I have a segwit wallet and you send bitcoin to me, all of MY transactions that I SEND are not malleable.
The idea that "remove all possible malleability on the network or else no meaning at all" is incorrect.
The goal is "get rid of malleability for all people who want to be rid of it." And that immediately enables tons of extra functionality with the protocol, as the hash for the txid will be unchangeable for those who wish to have their transactions unchangeable.

Adding 128 (80 in hex) to the SIGHASH_ALL which is normally used by 99% of clients tells the Bitcoin network that "this input is only signing all the outputs and its own input, but no one else's inputs are signed and can be changed however."
But the last signature, the last person to donate and finalize the project signs with a normal "I will sign every single input reference."

This is true with all iPhone apps. Therefore no point in comparing it.


The only possible attacks would be 1. an attack on privacy where someone monitors every single transaction originating from your IP. or 2. a DOS attack where some MITM blocks you from sending transactions to the network. (Edit: though tbh this assumes your iPhone is always accessing the internet from the same IP so that the attacker could track all your transactions.)
for 1. This is a worst case scenario for SPV, but might be common practice for closed server side source services... So while you are correct. This was a comparison with other iOS apps, and I think that this is the best it can get for iOS.
for 2. a MITM can only shut you off from the network, it can not forge your signatures or do anything to harm your wallet...
both 1 and 2 can be partially solved by using point to point encrypted VPN services etc...


If such a vulnerability was found on the iPhone... would you still use GreenAddress on your iPhone?... seriously?...
If such a vulnerability was found. There would be A LOT MORE at stake than just your pocket change... The consequences would be mind boggling... remember when celebs had their pictures stolen from iCloud? remember how much of a fuss that stirred up? imagine that x10000000 as every single iPhone user in the world is advised to power off their device or risk complete identity theft.

Whoa, way to bite the hand that feeds you.
If you misconstrued my comment as somehow making fun of you or belittling you, don't. That was in no way my intention, so calm down.
If your question is "do you know that one site I'm thinking about" the answer is "I'm no mind reader, so no."
However, I can almost guarantee you whatever that site was, it was using "child pays for parent," which a few large mining pools actually use for selecting transactions to mine.
The part about credit was merely proving a point: Bitcoin, even with 0 fees and taking hours upon hours to get 1 confirm is leagues better than CC.
Also, "if," and I emphasize if, you are requiring 1 conf for low cost items that need quick turn around (a la coffee example), then you will drive away customers. However, you said you ship something, so automatically that means the comment was not directed at you.
If you are shipping something, do what amazon does:
1. Simple card number check and address validation being ok = they tell you "your order has been placed" and you get an email.
2. Then, once the secondary verifications come back and everything looks in order, they send the item, and send another email saying "we have shipped your item"
3. However, in the event that secondary checks come back incorrectly, they send an email stating "there was problem with your payment, your card has not been charged, please contact support"
1 and 2 usually come back fine fairly quick which is why amazon is so fast, but when 3 happens, the shipping notification doesn't come for like 2-3 days, and then all of a sudden you get the error email.
You could do the same. 1 on 0 conf, 2 on 1 conf and 3 in the case that 0 conf continues for more than x amount of time (or if the mem pool deletes the transaction after 48 hours)
Also, you could attempt to use "child pays for parent", but you would need to find a way to get the transaction to miners that use it, reliably. And you will have to wait until those miners find a block.
If I come off as whatever you think I come off as, I apologize, as I'm not one to beat around bushes, and my grammar is usually pretty poor.

There's a probability that I could mine 500 blocks in a row with my CPU within 1 second of mining.
There's also a probability where someone with 99% of the mining power could mine for decades and never finding a block, and the other 1% could find blocks every 2 seconds.
So, no. There is no 100% chance way to guarantee you will mine the next block or will always mine a longer chain than the other chain. Until it happens, at least, but probabilities are irrelevant to past events.

What would the gap limit be?
I'm guessing that would mean you have a friendlist cap (=gap limit) until enough friends send you money?
Being an avid PSN user, let me say: friendlist caps blow, and a large portion of people never interact with you... But you want to keep them just in case (though in this wallet case "deleting friends" and reusing the chain you gave them would not be ideal.)
Not to mention, recovering the wallet might be fine, but if you wanted to continue using the wallet, you would need to figure out which chain was given to which friend and you would need to figure out the xpubs of each friend.
Long story short: This service would require one of two things:
1. A centralized service to track your info for you.
2. A wallet that would require periodic backups of ever-increasing size.
Which would you think is better?
1 could be something like Ninki Wallet where they are already standing there to cosign, so you might as well give them your friendlist to hold onto.
2 might be hard for the average joe...

OP_RETURN is allowed for data up to 40 bytes.
It is a normal transaction since 0.9.0, and is basically a 0 value output with the ScriptPubkey of OP_RETURN OP_PUSHDATA (&lt;= 40 bytes of data)
You don't need any other outputs... but to make a valid transaction, you need to have an input.
One of my friends runs a service that generates OP_RETURN transactions, and he doesn't even create any value outputs. He splits up his site funds into a bunch of 0.0001 BTC utxos, and then he uses one of those inputs, then creates only the OP_RETURN output, and therefor the input goes 100% to the fee.
It will cost a transaction fee of at least 0.00001 BTC per transaction (if the transaction is under 1000 bytes)
You can store 40 bytes, so you could use that in any way you like. (32 bytes for SHA256, then 8 bytes to store some metadata for your service... etc.)

BIP 44 is a standardization of BIP32 wallet formatting.
If you notice, BIP32 states nowhere in its proposal which branches should be used, and how, as a standard. It just merely says "if we do this math, we COULD standardize wallets and allow using the seeds across wallets"
BIP44 tries to encompass all possible use cases. One of those being "using the same seed for a BIP32 Bitcoin, Litecoin, DogeCoin, etc etc. wallet."
If you use the same branch, you are effectively using the same private/public key pair for multiple alt coins, which would not REALLY be safe (remember, BIP32's POINT is to NOT reuse the same private keys more than once) That is why BIP44 offers a branch to split different coins on, just in case.
I think BIP44 will turn into something good, but in the interim... I guess we'll just do a 1 seed 1 wallet thing for a while.

Japan bankruptcy proceedings require by law that all assets of the bankrupt entity be sold for Japanese yen. Then the courts sit around with their fingers up their butts for 5 years. Then they divy up the left over funds after paying for lawyer fees etc. to the creditors (in this case users) IN JAPANESE YEN.
You will have to convert the JPY to whatever currency, or bitcoin on your own once they decide to give it to you.
Bankruptcy law was created a loooong time ago and changed a lot during the Japanese economic bubble burst in the 90's.
Still rather archaic... But I know people in the JP Bitcoin scene who are personally talking to the courts about holding off the liquidation of the BTC, and/or how to sell them off market to maximize capital, etc.
Then of course the second any of those 50k addresses start moving I'm sure all the penny stock traders and bots will sell and tank the price then buy back at the bottom.

I am talking specifically about the derivation of public key from signature. In Bitcoin Core, you can sign/verify arbitrary messages using a "sign/verify" function. This function allows the verifying party to verify your signature WITHOUT your public key... (actually, they derive your public key from the r value and a special header byte alone.)
I have a good handle on Elliptic Curve math, but deriving the public key from the signature boggles my mind. I can calculate it, and I could code you a script that calculates it... but I don't natively understand it in my mind like I do with signature verification and Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman, and all these other things I deal with on a daily basis.

If it was, mycelium would be fine with it.
If mycelium is rejecting you at the phrase input screen, that means it must view the phrase as not meeting the BIP39 requirements. Unless you mistyped it into Mycelium.
If you have a 12 word phrase that uses xpub for the master pubkey, then it is a semi-rare (1/16 chance) v&gt;=2.0 12 word electrum phrase.
It could also be a v&lt;2.0 pre-BIP39 mnemonic. But that would have a fully hex encoded master public key.

See, China is being MORE nefarious.
Their politicians are buying tons of Bitcoin every time they make announcements. Selling everytime it eventually goes back up. Then sending out "reminders" that they get construed as "banning." Then they come out and say "oh we're not banning it, we're just preventing any business from actually you know, transacting with it and money at the same time."
They are basically manipulating the price for personal gain.
Chinese businesses need to take a cue from the Japanese Pachinko business. Just have the money/banking part be a "separate company" as the Bitcoin part. Bitcoin businesses don't have to deal with banks, and can steal deal in CNY in the same way.
Pachinko is gambling? oh nononono, we just give you "golden chips" that just so happen to be able to be sold for cash at the separate completely unrelated company always outside our doors. Every morning we buy golden chips from them, they do good business, nice fellas they are. *wink*

Wallet32 for Android.
For iOS unfortunately no apps support BIP0044 yet besides Mycelium...
No desktop wallets either...
You could always manually pull out the addresses from your seed using a tool like my site:
(for Mycelium, you'd have to type in your phrase in the "BIP39 passphrase" box, then change the "Derivation Path" to "Trezor k'th account i'th keypair (receive): m/44'/0'/k'/0/i" for your receiving addresses or "Trezor k'th account i'th keypair (change): m/44'/0'/k'/1/i" for your change addresses (the ones you automatically generate for every transaction to send your change to.))
(if you only have one "account" then leave the "Account (k)" at 0 and just increase "Keypair Index (i)" one by one until you find your address at the bottom... Once you find it, you can copy the "Private Key (WIF)" and import that into another wallet if Mycelium ever went down.)

Make sure the account that contains the address in question is "Active" and set as the "Current account"
Check the Transaction tab. It should show the transaction history of your second 0.4 BTC receipt there.
Then tap the rotating arrow button on the balance screen.
If that doesn't work, it's probably a bug with Mycelium iOS. It seems like the app was rushed, and it wasn't developed by the original team.

Some of the people who are playing almost consistently for hours on end are playing by the rules. The game just randomly pays out, and thus, the longer you play, the more you get.
That's the promise, and to say "oh well you're obviously playing 24/7 for the last 6 days so I'm going to block you from receiving bitcoin" is something that is not fair.

It only looks like no spread on the video. Unless they had a browser open to whatever exchange they use showing the website's rate is equal to the current buy and sell rates, for all we know, the price could have been much lower at the time of sale, then jumped up much higher just before buying, and we wouldn't know.
I doubt they would have the luck to orchestrate something like that, but just because the numbers they show on the site for the BTC-USD rate don't change doesn't mean the actual numbers being exchanged in the background don't.
Until they come out and say "We will never charge a spread" I will assume they take a spread. This does not change the fact that they're awesome and better than the alternatives. I am not putting them down, merely stating a fact of all forex (or their virtual currency counterparts) companies before them.

You assume that wallet devs just implement every feature possible willy nilly without thinking.
I know for a fact that Copay will not implement it, nor will breadwallet. In fact, Bitcoin Core's wallet will most likely not implement it either (they haven't even implemented HD wallets yet, so good luck on an undo button)
Any wallet that implements rbf as a user-driven undo button is irresponsible, and also has no clue how to make an intuitive app. At the very most I would think maybe a wallet that automatically handles fees and biffs up would automatically re-do the fee (to the same outputs) to ensure swift confirmation, but that's about the only use.
However, the only good part about the current rbf implementation is that you can identify them. Insight has already implemented it into their api so you can see if the transaction or any of its unconfirmed parents are rbf, so I'll bet most merchants (and most wallets) will warn or ignore transactions until they are in a block.
Meaning anyone who uses rbf is automatically shut off from receiving items within 10 minutes, also, if the next block is longer than 15 minutes (the default wait time for payments on most platforms) then they will have to contact support or hope they are aware enough to rbf it back to themselves before the next block is found. This is a huge usability detriment, so smart wallets will not implement this as a button.

Your cold wallet is a BitcoinQT wallet?
1. Install BitcoinQT on an offline computer
2. Load your wallet.dat file
3. In the console, unlock your wallet
4. Use the dump privkeys command
5. Copy the privkey that contains your bitcoins and import it into Electrum on your offline system
6. Install electrum on your online system
7. Create a watch only wallet and import the address there.
8. Generate the transaction with Electrum
9. Carry over the unsigned transaction using a usb device etc.
10. Sign it on the offline computer
11. Carry the signed transaction to your online computer
12. Broadcast.
You can create a fairly secure offline environment by booting your online device using a USB booted linux distro. Just make sure to physically unplug all LAN cables before booting.

Isn't BIP44 account/address discovery based on transaction history and not balance?
Or at least, it should be.
It seems iOS is basing it off of balance and not transaction history, which is one of the reasons problems are being caused.
I wonder what Android version bases discovery off of.
Edit: from BIP44


This is definitely a bug in Mycelium iOS and if it appears in Android, there too.
I will report the issue once I get home later today unless someone wants to report it for me.
Regardless though, fixing this bug won't completely solve Bruce's use case problem.
Maybe an advanced feature allowing users to generate addresses and accounts above the gap limit, but calculate which addresses and accounts are outside the gap limit and mark them in red with a big fat warning "this address will not be automatically restored when wallet recovered from seed" etc.
(Though to be honest, you should be doing this for any account 1 beyond the last one with history right now, as it seems BIP44 gap limit for accounts is just 1, technically)

The difficulty with HD wallets is that you have 2 contradicting ideas:
1. We want complete compatibility and usability across wallets.
2. We want complete customizability regardless of the wallet.
In order to attain 1 you must set rules like "when restoring the wallet phrase, only check these paths and only check addresses until you find 10 empty ones, then stop searching and assume there's no more"
However, to obtain 2 the user must remember all of their customizations, then the restoration process would be "what's your phrase? Which derivation path did you use? How many addresses do you want to check? etc."
Normal non-bitcoin-savvy people will need 1 to get a slick UX... But without 2 it might seem limiting (what you are feeling right now)...
Non-centralized wallet development is a lot of contradictions and balancing...
I just hope you don't think we (devs) aren't all thinking about these problems day to day.
I am definitely always open to hearing ideas from non-devs and will evangelize any good ideas I hear.

I received 0.0002 Gems as a test from one of the devs...
Then I tried to send it again and I got an error message stating "you must deposit more than 0.0005 BTC in your counterwallet to perform a counterparty action"
So currently the only way to use gems is to also receive at least 0.0005 BTC along with it...
Also, there was 0 notification in the Gems app that I had received anything.
It's still a SUUUUUUPER beta app.
They literally just slapped a hip sign up screen on it with a counterwallet signup screen... then added a button to check balances and a way to send gems (typing "x gems" in chat sends the amount)... then they just put it out as is.
All of the annoying parts of Telegram are still in there. Edit: In fact, the signup SMS message was from "Telegram:" and not "Gems". Being someone who knows and has used Telegram and knows the background of this app's development... sure I'll get it. But this app is definitely not ready for the average Joe.
Well... I can't blame them... they basically made this app without any funding...
Hopefully the 50% of funding they get in exchange for putting out this mess will give them the funding to actually make a usable app.

In South Korea, I have heard good things about:
So whatever their fees are, plus or minus however much the exchange rate changes while you're trying to figure out how to use it, is what would be your "fees" I guess.
I would recommend trying it with a small amount of bitcoin first just so you can get an idea of how to use it. Then they can do larger amounts in a shorter amount of time because they already know how to use it.

The idea of "to" and "from" do not exist in bitcoin.
In bitcoin, I lock bitcoins with a puzzle that I know only you can solve.
blockchain.info and other sites just collect all the transactions locked with the same puzzle and collect them in pages.
I could lock bitcoins with " + 5 = 8" and if you created a transaction referring to that transaction and put in "3" you would have those bitcoins to be usable in your new transaction.
Just because I had to unlock puzzle xyz in order to send bitcoins does not mean it is a "from" address.
**Why is perpetuating the "from" and "to" address fallacy a problem? It's BASICALLY the same.**
No. Promoting the idea of "from" addresses makes users think they can just return unwanted bitcoins to the puzzle that sent them. (like a "return to sender") But a person might have sent to you from their paper wallet, and having spent it all, thrown it away... you never know.
Also promoting "to" address makes people think that "sending to the same address multiple times is ok!" which, while admittedly not as bad as sending to the address that sent to you, is also very bad for privacy. You are not only lowering your privacy, but the privacy of the recipient.

K, I'm gonna throw this out there and see if anyone can explain it to me.
I understand ECDH, I understand the signature algorithm and why the verification algo is correct, I would consider myself versed in EC math...
But for some reason, even though I can understand and implement the code for it, I just can't get to the point where I feel like I truly UNDERSTAND the pubkey from sig algorithm used in bitcoin-qt message signatures...
Anyone that can explain it in a way that will make me have that "a ha!" type understanding, I'd appreciate it.
I get the math, or maybe I don't, and that's why I just see the equations as a "this is how it is because that's how it is, so just do these calculations"...
The human mind is interesting.
Edit: I am talking about this PDF file.
Section 4.1.6
Edit 2: I figured it out.
Thanks for the link. Actually, I just figured it out on IRC.
There are 4 possible possibilities for finding the R point from the r value in the sig.
1. r is x as is, y is positive
2. r is x as is, y is negative
3. r is x modded by n, y is positive
4. r is x modded by n, y is negative.
So we test all four of these (3 and 4 calc x by doing r + n to get x) for the properties of an EC point (multiply by n = infinity point etc.) then once we are certain which one is the real R point, we insert into the equation:
    Q = r^-1 (sR - zG)
    
    The proof of validity of the above formula is as follows
    (separate G)
    r * da * G = s * k * G - z * G
    (eliminate G)
    da * r = s * k - z
    z + da * r = s * k
    k^-1(z + da * r) = s
    And we're back to the signature generation algorithm

Pretty much.
Watch-only wallet even though restored from seed - Red flag.
Tons of transactions that immediately withdraw what was put in with a final balance of zero - Red flag.
I actually accidentally restored to it once, and the second it said Watch-only I knew something was up, and once I saw the transaction history and balance, I KNEW it wasn't mine.
imo keeping your wits about you when it comes to money is always the best thing to do.

Because the inputs add up to 501.44158 BTC and the outputs add up to 301.44158 BTC.
Subtraction. 200 BTC fee.
The miner's fee in a transaction is the sum of the inputs minus the sum of the outputs.
Looks like someone tried to make a transaction by hand in the console, or used buggy wallet software. They probably meant to include a 0.02 BTC ($2) fee but forgot some decimal places... OR they got confused by the other outputs adding up to 200 BTC and thought they had to subtract it from the other output or something like that. Brain farts happen sometimes.

To put it plain and simple:
1. use this when signing 
2. use BIP32 to generate keys
3. when generating the master seed for BIP32, be sure to use a cryptographically secure RNG along with any and as much input from the user as you can to securely generate the seed.
Following those 3 steps will pretty much remove 99% of RNG attack vectors.

BIP is just a mixture of previously existing technologies put together in a standard method known as a "Bitcoin Improvement Protocol" to allow users to encrypt their private keys.
So the answer is yes and no.
Yes, BIP, in its very nature, only exists because of Bitcoin... However, scrypt and aes encryption existed before BIP38.

No one else does, and that's why it hasn't happened.
The next update will support dynamic fees that will change directly proportionately to supply and demand of block space.
So if the supply of block space that miners are offering is greater than the demand of people wanting to get confirmed in a timely manner, then the fees of transactions will go down. If the demand is higher than the supply, then transaction fees will go up.
Currently average fees is about 0.0001 BTC for an average of 259 byte transactions... This fee average goes up as you move the spread of transaction sizes closer to the actual average.
However, this is shaped solely by a sort of unwritten agreed upon fee of 0.0001 BTC per kb rounded up.
So once they implement dynamic fees, I think average fees will go down until we start seeing a huge spike in volume of transactions. Then it will probably come back up.
Right now with the current MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE of 0.00001 BTC and MIN_TX_FEE of 0.0001 BTC mempools of the biggest mining pools are pretty full, so it stands to say that if you lowered fees to 1 satoshi, confirmation times would be like an average of 7-10 blocks to confirm your transaction once (as they can't fit them all in one block)
Basically, you have put 0 thought into it and just assume that the people who think about it day and night are stupid for no reason except that "I think transactions should be free because lol"
If you truly think 1 satoshi fees are feasible, write up a research paper using arguments based in economic theory and tests you've done using testnet etc. to try and support your thesis. Then send that whitepaper to the bitcoin development mailing list.
If you're not going to put in the time to think things through, no one will listen to you. And this is why you are being downvoted.

While Bitcoin can not be manipulated through QE, it can definitely be manipulated if a Big Bank bought some BTC off market in large amounts, then dumped them on the market to tank the price.
It can also be manipulated in the opposite direction by hackers/insiders of exchanges that could manipulate balances and buy up all the BTC with funny money.

In Bitcoin, we don't want oversight by governments, and if you want to use the protocol directly, you either need to A. Learn about the protocol and run your own node. B. Trust someone else's ledger. C. Give your bitcoins to coinbase and have all the government oversight you want.

When I first saw your project, I was VERY excited about the cold storage via unused mobile devices sitting around the house.
However, being a contributor to Electrum, I have been a deterministic wallet proponent for a very long time.
Electrum 2.0's release should be followed shortly by a Kivy based version for Android. This will allow for 2of2 and 2of3 multisig with your PC or another Android device via the transaction relay plugin...
However, we will not have a server that can do rate limiting, etc... and currently we have no plans. (So it will be more like a more decentralized Copay)
Hearing all this stuff about the new version, I am highly tempted to switch over.
Just 2 questions:
1. "Easy to backup (only need HDM Cold seed)" does this mean the Server key and the Hot key are derived from the cold key? (as if it wasn't, I would assume you'd also need the xpub from the server key and the xprv from the hot key to generate the addresses)
2. Will the user be able to scan / input their own xprv/BIP39 phrases as their key(s)? (In case I want to generate my own entropy) How would that process work?
Thanks in advanced. I can't wait to try it out.

The problem is a Mt. Gox scenario.
Basically, bitcoin can't be created out of thin air like dollars, so if Coinbase or Circle didn't have enough BTC to cover 100% of deposits, last one out holds the bags.
Of course, if you trust Coinbase or Circle, then storing bitcoin with them is fine. However, if they betray your trust you'll have a hard time filing complaints and class action lawsuits and all that stuff.
However, on the flip side, there are a lot of people who come to the Electrum forum saying "I typed my phrase in perfectly and it won't show me my bitcoins!" or "I am inputting my password perfectly and I can't send my bitcoins." (Which they aren't. They just THINK they remember their password, but really they forgot)
Since Electrum is a program, not a service, no one can help you except for tech savvy volunteers, but with Coinbase etc they know everything about you, so a social security number or some such identifying info would be sufficient for a password reset etc.
It really depends on whether you trust yourself with following directions or Coinbase with not running fractional reserves?

Are you connected to public wifi?
If so, most public wifi (and some cell phone carriers) block port 8333... which means you can not talk to the Bitcoin network directly.
As breadwallet talks directly to the Bitcoin network, this is a problem...
However, I have only noticed problems when connected to public wifi... I then called to ask the chain's head offices if their public wifi blocks traffic, and I got a response saying they block all traffic that is not on commonly used ports (80 etc.) for security reasons.
My only suggestion would be:
1. Try it on your home wifi (which should be fine, unless you set up your home internet to block port 8333)
2. try on your cell data
3. If everything else fails, use a different wallet.
Edit: Also, as I mentioned in another post somewhere. Hive Wallet for iOS uses the same phrase formatting and derivation algorithms, so pluging your restore phrase into hive will give you access to your bitcoins....
however, Hive's servers go down sometimes...
Nobody's perfect...
but as long as you have that phrase, there is a mathematical way of calculating all your private keys from that that does not rely on any one service.
Heck, I could calculate your private keys from your phrase by typing in 3 or 4 lines into my command prompt on my PC.
@_date: 2015-01-25 09:26:22
That would be pretty dumb.
You need to use the private key and the transaction hash to sign anything anyways, so you might as well use RFC6979.
The worst case scenario with a leaked k is the attacker can calculate your private key, but if you need the private key to calculate k, they won't ever be able to calculate k...

CoinPocket - Open source - Only uses one key, only uses 3rd party APIs. Address reuse is bad. Fail.
GreenAddress - Client side Open source - Multisig, HD wallet are great. Server side code closed source. Centralized company could be snooping on you. Fail.
Pheeva - All Closed source = fail.
Mycelium - Open Source - Server side code is closed source. Also, the iOS version was apparently "coded by an outside source" and just plopped into the hands of the team. They are so busy with Entropy and whatnot, I would not be surprised if they haven't looked over the code thoroughly... However, the Mycelium team is great (if not a tad overworked, lately :-)) so I would like to trust them and recommend this wallet... but in my eyes, BreadWallet is so much more newb friendly.
Bither - Open Source - address management is done individually. Very much geared toward a veteran Bitcoiner. Also allows for cold storage using 2 iDevices. Very good score overall, but when you think of the many ways it allows for human error (by people who aren't super techy Bitcoiners) it is not "secure" in the sense that you could recommend it to a newb.
Blockchain.info - Open Source - I would stay away for a while until we see some sort of revamping of the wallet... Their server side code is closed source, and lax dev procedures caused hundreds of bitcoins to be stolen. (though I commend that they DID refund anyone who was affected)
Hive - Open Source - This is also a great wallet, but one thing that always bothered me (I tried to fight for it on Github, but they were adamant about it) is that they don't ever allow the user to see the seed again except for the initial wallet creation screen. They also don't store the seed anywhere, so they couldn't show you the mnemonic phrase retroactively even if they wanted to. I like where they're going (a multi currency wallet) but definitely not newb friendly.
bitWallet - closed source - fail
Circle - Closed source - Fail as a wallet, but if you have a Circle account, this is a great way to buy bitcoin on the go using your credit card. Highly recommended if you use Circle. Just send the bitcoins to your breadwallet once you receive them.
Coinbase - Closed source - Also, this app was not made internally at Coinbase... Sooo... I guess a similar evaluation to Circle... except Coinbase takes forever to give you your bitcoins... so you can't really buy bitcoins "on the go" so much... unless you can use instant buy with the iPhone app? idk... anyone who uses the app feel free to jump in.
breadwallet - Open Source - HD wallet that properly manages change and does not allow users to manage addresses (and risk re-using them) Also, all meaningful interactions with the wallet are done directly to the Bitcoin network itself using bloom filters while connected directly to full nodes. The seed for the wallet is encrypted using your PIN number and is in the secure element... so no other app, even Apple themselves (or so they claim) can not access it. The security measures for PIN failures are pretty strict, so you can rest assured that even if someone stole your phone, they won't get your bitcoins. Backup is simple. The user interface is made with a new person in mind (remember that Youtube video of the newb sending $400 of bitcoin to an ATM with 0 fee and not getting his money until the next day? Nope, can't do that with breadwallet). The only drawbacks are 1. using APIs for exchange rates, which can only be more safe by maybe taking results from multiple APIs and comparing... 2. Some public WiFi spots block traffic on port 8333 so breadwallet can't communicate with nodes. This causes some weird bugs currently, but is being worked on. 3. Sweeping addresses using bloom filters would take minutes. (because it would have to ask for the ENTIRE BLOCKCHAIN's worth of filtered content... which is a LOT more than when you create a new wallet. Currently, a new wallet will only download the headers up to the block that was current when breadwallet was released, because it knows there couldn't possible be a history... BUT with sweeped addresses, you have NO CLUE when they were made, so you have to perform getBlocks() for the ENTIRE BLOCKCHAIN... due to this, a third party API was chosen in order to prioritize user experience... It could be made better by querying multiple sites for the balance to check for consensus.

@_date: 2014-10-15 12:41:15
That's the thing. The standard says "the seed of the wallet does not depend on the wordlist"
So that means no matter what wordlist you use, you can generate your seed as long as they support BIP39 (as BIP39 seed generation merely hashes your phrase)... However, most wallets tend to check the phrase against their own wordlists, when they should just generate the wallet.

I just checked, and BitWallet is 5 accounts with 15 addresses each max of empty addresses.
The use case you explain is more of a merchant style use case, so it might be better to use a merchant style service.
I created a tool for HD wallet phrase recovery and generation.
This might help you generate the addresses beyond the 10th account.
Mycelium uses the "Trezor..." Path setting. If you change the account number you should see the addresses you've been giving out.
HD wallets are pretty weary of generating addresses that it won't recover on restoring the seed... As normal users won't want to remember how many addresses they used.

Mycelium seeds are BIP39 compatible using BIP32 to derive accounts using BIP44.
Electrum was the first wallet to use determinism (pre-BIP32) and the first wallet to use a mnemonic seed (pre-BIP39) so it makes sense that two completely different seed generation algorithms are incompatible.
You can use Mycelium phrases with Wallet32 and the Trezor hardware wallet.

That's like saying "we need to implement every UX feature of Gmail into smtp"
No, because not every mail server has the same needs as Google, and adding on superfluous garbage to the protocol layer is inefficient.
You merely think this because up to now, almost all consumer based wallets have been using the protocol directly.
For example, if you accidentally send 2 BTC from Circle to Coinbase, they could EASILY implement transaction reversal.
They don't because right now they market the "no chargeback" thing as a feature to merchants. Allowing reversal would be going back on their promise.
Not to mention that transaction reversibility would be impossible to implement into a decentralized ledger. With no middlemen, you'd lose all fungibility, as you could never be sure that you received payment.

Thanks for the link. Actually, I just figured it out on IRC.
There are 4 possible possibilities for finding the R point from the r value in the sig.
1. r is x as is, y is positive
2. r is x as is, y is negative
3. r is x modded by n, y is positive
4. r is x modded by n, y is negative.
So we test all four of these (3 and 4 calc x by doing r + n to get x) for the properties of an EC point (multiply by n = infinity point etc.) then once we are certain which one is the real R point, we insert into the equation:
    Q = r^-1 (sR - zG)
    
    The proof of validity of the above formula is as follows
    (separate G)
    r * da * G = s * k * G - z * G
    (eliminate G)
    da * r = s * k - z
    z + da * r = s * k

I think Credit cards are a third party required service, but I guess you don't?
Your premise confuses me... But I will just say that, besides QE, the "cash fiat protocol" does not support paper flying out of your wallet, through the sky, and to the recipient... In a similar way, Bitcoin is merely cash.

I think BIP44 states scanning 10 empty accounts and 10 empty addresses (empty meaning no history) before stopping... So maybe this is a bug or a misinterpretation of BIP44... I'll have to look into it.
But either way, if you're giving away a ton of addresses that you aren't sure whether or not it will be used before you have to give out more... Even electrum has a gap limit, so any HD solution will limit how many addresses you can use at once.
Again, if you use external tools it's possible, but then Mycelium won't know to check the addresses beyond the 10th one.

Multisig is hard because:
1. You trust someone to co-sign for you and you trust they won't have server maintenance. (Or be stuck with having to pull out your recovery key and use some tool to swipe all your funds / compromise your recovery key so you need to generate a new one)
2. Or you can have two devices that do signing, which requires carrying around two devices and unless your phone supports OTG cables, you are trusting someone to make a multisig partially signed transaction relay service for you. See 
If Multisig was a catch all solution for every use case then trust me, you'd see it everywhere.
Unfortunately it comes with a lot of caveats.
Just FYI you can spend multisig using Trezor via Greenbits on Android. Probably exactly what you are looking for.
Unfortunately, iPhone does not support OTG cables nor have they opened up NFC to developers yet (iPhone 6 and up) so iPhone will be a while.

OpRet is only used in the notification transaction.
The notification is not meant to transfer value.
So if you are planning on sending only one payment to a payment code, you need to make 2 separate transactions.
So this method is not without drawbacks.
To counteract those drawbacks, alternative methods of sending the notification have been proposed.
However these methods are not very mobile friendly (bitmessage)...
Also, blockchain based notifications makes re-syncing via SPV difficult, as you have to re-load the bloom filter multiple times, possibly every block if you get a lot of notifications.
I am not too familiar with bitmessage on the protocol level. But if they could improve their mobile support I assume it would help a ton.

Just FYI, "Wallet32" and "Mycelium" are both apps that support the exact same settings as Trezor, so you can restore your Trezor seed with them, and use them to send to a new paper wallet etc.
Another alternative is this tool I made, which you can use offline:
1. Download this page. Which can also be downloaded from Github (link at the bottom of the page)
2. Open the /english/index.html file in a browser like Firefox / Chrome.
3. Type in the seed into the seed box.
4. Type in the "optional passphrase" if you have any, in the "Optional password" area.
5. Set "Derivation Path" to "Trezor... (receive)" / "Trezor... (change)" and change the Account and Keypair index to search for your keys.
6. Trezor only shows you the (receive) addresses, and should only start from account 0 keypair index 0. If you have multiple "accounts" on your MyTrezor wallet, then you must increase the account number to find your private keys, etc.
7. Once you have retrieved all the individual private keys from the tool, you can import them into Electrum on the same offline setup where you ran the website.
8. You can then copy paste the addresses to the imported keys into an online installation of Electrum to make a watch-only client.
9. Use Electrum's offline signing feature as normal.
(Note: the process is only complicated because it is the most secure option to recover without having the Trezor seed touch the net. If you are willing to risk it for a few seconds, [1. set up your new cold storage 2. import into Mycelium. 3. immediately send to the new cold storage the entire balance.] SHOULD be fine... but it depends on how much risk you want to take.)

@_date: 2015-01-12 11:19:39
This says that MyTrezor (their web wallet) will select and sort utxos in order of age (oldest confirm) and in order of value (smallest value first)
This means that in your example, if the 8 BTC was in block 4 and the 1.5 AND 0.5 were in block 6... Trezor would ALWAYS pick the 8 BTC first.. However, if you chose to send 9 BTC, it would use all 3 of your utxos. as the order is 8 -&gt; 0.5 (8.5 is not enough, so continue) -&gt; 1.5 = 10 BTC in, 9 BTC out, 1 BTC change.
Electrum is the same way. (Blockheight first, value ascending second)
Edit: I am not sure if the version I linked is the current version (I linked the "stable" tag) but current master is the same.

The EC math calculations are possible... you'd need about a week or so to do it. That would get you your r value... then you would just need to do some modular arithmetic which would take a while, but not a week.
The rest would just be figuring out the inputs you control, converting the outputs you're sending into hex etc...

Multisig is Multiple Signature Wallet.
The idea is that you install the same app on multiple devices. (You + 3 friends, or your phone + your computer) Then each device generates their own key (like you would do with a normal bitcoin wallet)
But the magic happens when you all join your wallets together in a wallet with the condition "out of this x number of people, y people must approve in order to send any bitcoin."
So if I use my android and my PC, and I want to send bitcoin to bitpay to pay for something:
1. I scan the QR for payment with my android, or click it on my PC.
2. I click or tap OK, enter my password or scan my thumb or whatever.
3. The OTHER device will show "pending proposal"
4. I will approve of the transaction on the second device with my password or my thumb scan.
5. The bitcoin will be sent.
I will need to backup the key from my PC AND the key from my android (both will be 12 word phrases to write down)
It's nice because even if your PC is hacked, they still need your android to get your bitcoin.
Still. Trezor is the most secure solution though.

If the child transaction relies on a parent with RBF flag that is the original tx, same behavior as always.
However, if the 2nd replacement is the tx used in the child tx, then since nodes with rbf deactivated will reject the replacement parent, the node will reject any children based off the replacement tx as well.

What is the specific thing you were trying to buy?
I think that most places could do what Amazon does, and give you a nice "order placed" screen with fine print telling you in their ToS that the order is not legally placed until their backend processes it.
I have had one-click buys on Amazon fail on me, and nothing was charged to my card to begin with (meaning they never even processed it).
In a similar process, a merchant could just tell you the order is complete!!! Now we will e-mail you with details! (This might take up to 10 minutes) With all the legal mumbo jumbo about how orders aren't really complete until the transaction confirms x times hidden in the ToS.
It's all about how the customer feels. Follow Amazon's lead and just make people feel like it was fast and it should be good imo.
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:03:45
Not possible
It is not 0 balance that triggers this, it is 10 accounts with 0 transaction history ( no incoming or outgoing transactions ) that triggers this.
The reason this happens is to prevent you from generating 500000000 accounts, then getting mad when some wallet doesn't check it when you restore the phrase.
Also remember that a 10 account 10 address "gap limit" is specified within BIP44, and since Mycelium is BIP44 compliant, oh well.
If you want to make account 17, make sure no more than 9 accounts between 1 and 16 have 0 transactions on record.
If you want, you can send a little bitcoin to some of the accounts, or use those accounts for whatever it is you are trying to do.
There's no realistic need for more than 10 empty accounts at any given time.
If you MUST know the 11th account's address. There are external tools that will tell you... But any bitcoins on those addresses will not be discovered when recovering from your seed.
@_date: 2015-01-11 04:58:52
Mycelium supports BIP0044.
Breadwallet and Hive don't.
This is because bw and hive started development back when everyone was using their own derivation paths and no one was compatible... it just so happened that they chose the same path.
BIP0044 is a much more robust BIP32 derivation scheme which allows for more functionality from apps... but unfortunately, the only apps that support it are Mycelium and Wallet32 (Android only)
(in response to Mycelium, breadwallet, and Hive are all BIP39 compliant.)

Because in a world where all transactions in all blocks are segwit, witness data is the first candidate for pruning. Meaning that while it does put a strain on the network for bandwidth initially, you could make your node prune all witness data that is 100 blocks or older and you would have a secure sense of what the blockchain is currently, but without the extra witness data.

The date stamp is only there to speed up thr recovery process from 30 minutes to a couple minutes (if you don't tell MultibitHD the date to start searching for funds from, then it will search from the beginning of the blockchain.

deterministic is the opposite of random. k doesn't have to be a random number, it just needs to be a number that is unique and not easily guessed by a third party. RFC6979 k values are not random, they are a complex hash of basically your private key + the hash of the transaction. This way in order for someone to determine your k value they must know your private key, and every transaction you sign is guaranteed to have a different hash as the transaction hash will always be different.


Bitcoin Core is talking about moving to RFC 6979 for signatures, but fyi, since the Android incident, BitcoinJ, Bitcore, bitcoinjs-lib, libbitcoin, and a bunch of other libraries all switched to RFC6979... so basically the only one left is Bitcoin Core.


You don't store k in the transaction. You store r in the transaction, and r is necessary to verify the signature, so no. RFC6979 does not affect the size of transactions.

No, not trolling. No need to get all defensive. (wow)
You asked how an attack surface could come up. I explained how shitty programming (you know, like the shitty programming that caused the bc.i debacle?) can lead to an attack surface problem.
The problem I was trying to demonstrate is that RFC6979, when implemented properly, is an amazing tool, but one wrong step and you could have another bc.i on your hands.
Again, with proper testing and good programming practices, RFC6979 is a great solution. Much better than rng, I know.
However, you asked for ways it could be the cause of an attack surface, and my attack surface was:
"the coder is the attacker, and they implement tests incorrectly / RFC6979 spec incorrectly... but in a way that others might not pick up on it. Since most people understand RFC6979 should generate the same sig for the same message and privkey, they might look at the (malicious) test function, see it come back ok, run it twice, see it comes out the same... OK good... then bam, it turns out they weren't good."
The same exact attack could be done using rng by poisoning the rng... the only huge difference would be engineering a way to make the tests look like they're valid and following known vectors, but in actuality they just return true no matter what or some other way.
But to really sum up what I was saying:
You asked for "how could someone fuck up with RFC6979 and open themselves up to attack?" under the pretense of "there's no attack vectors" and I was just pointing to "what if the coder himself was the attacker and the victim, his colleagues, didn't know better?" So technically, not a RFC6979 weakness per se, but a good way to demonstrate that coding any crypto is VERY VERY sensitive, and multiple people who understand it thoroughly should always be checking the code. If only one pair of eyes are on it, it shouldn't go live. RFC6979 does not magically remove that caveat, and does not magically remove the "malicious coder with oblivious colleagues" vector.

Both BIP39 and Electrum use special word lists that are chosen for ease of remembering, length, and usage of specific letters.
Choosing a word not on the list of the protocol you're using will return an error.
Also, the last word of BIP39 seeds contains a checksum, so human-selected seeds are not valid. (Unless you can figure out how to manually generate the checksum and pick the last word correctly.)

Sounds like you're ok now, but a lot of users make the mistake of inputting their 12 word phrase in as their password.
The 12 word phrase is used to recover your bitcoins in the event of lost password / computer blew up etc.

If someone on old software mined a 2MB block, the old software and new software would have a disagreement on that block, and each subsequent block would then two separate chains running in parallel.
Otherwise, going the other way wouldn't be a hard fork.
Either way, the point is moot. The thought of a hard fork being an altcoin is ludicrous. Otherwise you can consider Bitcoin 0.11.2 as being an altcoin to the original Satoshi client that just so happened to keep the namesake. (since there has been hard forks since then)

When user inputs privkey, have them set a PIN code, BIP38 encrypt it, send it to your servers, then whenever the privkey is needed, have their browser ask for the PIN, decrypt locally, and perform all necessary calculations client side.

The BIP38 private key contains a hash of the final address, so there should be nothing to worry about.

Well, unless you are testing against a set of known vectors, I could make a fancy RFC6979(-ish) function for your site, but in actuallity, it initializes what was SUPPOSED to be the private key bytes, and only actually uses the digest bytes to generate k.
Result: If I made this look like a bug, and knew that it was going to happen, I could take the digest of any tx coming from you to generate k without knowing your private key, then use k to generate your private key.
Seeing as the average observer will not be testing every tx for an RFC6979 implementation that does not use the private key... it will look like every r is unique (as every tx digest must be unique by design) but in actuality, the person who engineered the "bug" could steal keys, and maybe syphon off BTC here and there to go undetected...
etc. etc.

On average, novels have 80k words in them.
attempt 1: start with the first Y words in the book.
attempt 2: start with the second word, using Y words.
This means you have to attempt 80,000 - (Y - 1) times to try all possible Y length phrases.
More than likely the phrase will start after a period and end with a period... but even if we just try everything, 80,000 attempts at a single SHA256 brainwallet is literally 0.1 seconds on my ultra shitty laptop from a bijillion years ago that has trouble opening Chrome without dying.
Now, if your password was used with a very strong anti-brute force algorithm with a high iteration count... you're effectively making each attempt cost as much as tens of thousands of attempts.
Something like bitcoin core and other security sensitive programs aim for over 1 second decryption on top of the line computers, so that 80,000 guesses will take 80,000 seconds. But still... that's less than a day.

possible meanings:
1. You have received 1800 separate transactions to your wallet and are trying to move all the bitcoins you've received. Resulting in a 266 kilobyte transaction. (unlikely)
2. There was a bug in their software making your fee high. (likely, but considering 3, probably not the case)
3. The app uses confusing English... they mean to say that the maximum amount you can SEND is $296 (which is your total available minus the fee) and they are not talking about the fee alone, as indicated by the colon...
I think it's 3... imagine the phrase with some imaginary parenthesis
Use (total available minus fee) which calculates to 0.29624848 BTC

The Bitcoin network views fees on a per byte basis.
In other words, a 1000 byte transaction should have twice the fee of a 500 byte transaction if it expects to receive the same priority from miners.
When making a bitcoin transaction, you have to reference and sign for every single transaction you have received bitcoin with.
If you receive 1 BTC in one transaction, spending that whole balance will require 1 reference with 1 signature.
If you receive 1 BTC over the span of 100 transactions, spending that whole balance will require 100 references with 1 signature EACH (100 signatures).
In general, each reference + signature combination is about 32 + 4 + 73 + 33, so 142 bytes per reference+signature pair (this is actually much larger for multi-sig wallets like GreenBits etc)
So if you are trying to send your transaction at 70 bits per kilobyte, you would need to add 10 bits to your fee for each reference in order to keep the byte to fee ratio.
Faucets are not a good deal, and to be honest, Any faucet pay out under 0.000015 BTC is just costing you money. (142 bytes is about 1/7 of 1000 bytes, and the network is about 0.0001 BTC per kilobyte.)

5. You would have to have 0 knowledge of bitcoin block explorer sites, never try to send or receive to or from anyone else but the attacker and his colluders.

Transaction fees are, by definition, out of control.
The user can not control them. Nor can the market.
Nodes control them by setting policies to drop txes they view as spam. This can be any amount, and no node announces this info.
Miners control them by including transactions only that they deem as "not spam." These policies are not public, these policies are not reliable.
I know your goal is to try and "stick it" to the large blockers so they will see the ways of your small block agenda, but let me make one thing clear.
Big block or small block. Transaction fees are broken. RBF is not a solution, and it's a gigantic bandaid. A bandaid made out of cyanide.
Please do not make it sound like transaction fees are not broken. Because they are. Large blocks won't fix them, RBF won't fix them. We need a real solution.
However, just in the same way lowering the block size limit (actually, creating it) was to put a bandaid on possible DOS attacks, we need larger blocks to put a bandaid on the broken fee system that will lead to unreliable network performance for a majority of users.
Bitcoin is a rickety ship with lots of holes that need to be plugged and we keep taking the rags we stuffed in one hole out and shoving them in another hole.
I think we all have our hearts in the right place. We all see the opposing side of our views as "trying to kill bitcoin" and therefore "must be paid by the government to do so" etc.
But rather than make flame inciting posts based of false statements (transaction fees are not out of control) we should be discussing solutions to these problems.

For 2, there are (in general) two separate algorithms that are used to generate the phrase itself and two separate algorithms to generate the addresses from the data gather from the phrase algorithm.
The best way to explain to you how to independently recover bitcoins from the method is if you tell me the name of the wallet service that generated the phrase for you.

had the right answer.
As an interesting aside, in ECDSA, you can calculate the public key from a signature alone, so technically you don't need to include the public key (in fact, most bitcoin message signers don't to make a smaller signature) as the verifier can calculate the public key from the signature, then use the public key and signature to verify the signature.

In Bitcoin, to send someone a direct payment, you either need their permission, or their bitcoin address.
Find someone that publishes their bitcoin address or ask someone directly.
Projects like Darkwallet manage a multi-sig together, but Bitcoin is more decentralized than DW's team, so it's harder for them to do such a thing.
The most viable solution is something like lighthouse, but that's not going to be what you're looking for.
The true answer would be to review every commit, find a commit you see as contributing largely to the community at large, then contacting that person and asking them for their address.

private keys in bitcoin have a set number of "decimal places" they must be in length. This is 256 bits, or 32 bytes.
So if you want to represent 1, you need to pad the left side with zeroes. These zeroes are meaningless, but make sure the private key is always the same length.
If you want to learn how the private key turns into the public key, look up "elliptic curve multiplication" on youtube. Then just know that bitcoin uses the secp256k1 curve constants which consists of a generator point on the curve called G.
The public key is the point that results when you multiply the generator G by the private key p.
(In ECDSA, usually lower case represents integer variables, and upper case represents point variables)

Hierarchical means that there are multiple levels each with their own index value. Deterministic just means that there is an index value (in Electrum's case, one) that is changed, and inputting the same index value (in HD's case, for each level) will always give you the same address.

OK let's make things clear:
A hard fork change is OK, as long as everyone switches over.
But "to hard fork" aka "There is a hard fork going on right now" means that two separate blockchains are currently running. This means that there is no consensus on what is a valid block. This situation is very bad.
But yeah as long as you plan ahead and make sure people follow the update, and everyone updates, you're fine.
Like when P2SH was added, dev mailing list said for every miner that agreed to upgrade to place the letters "P2SH" in the header of their blocks. If over 50% of the previous x blocks (I think they waited a week or so) contained those letters, it would mean that over 50% of the mining power agrees with the upgrade and a hard fork change can be updated accordingly (as the ones who didn't add those letters into their headers could see that they lost)
hard-fork changes = OK as long as everyone, or almost everyone updates.
a hard fork = catastrophic.

That would be fine. Since the keychain is encouraging address reuse anyways.


Master Public keys can not be "sent to" as they do not represent anything that is relevant on the blockchain, it is only relevant to your wallet software which USES the MPK to generate addresses for you.
All wallets I am aware of do not allow you to scan an MPK and send money to it... primarily because the only person who knows the path from the MPK to your address generation addresses is YOUR wallet software. Any wallet trying to do so would be ASSUMING something like BIP44 is being used, which would be dangerous.
tl;dr you can't use MPK to send to someone + Any address that shows up on your Hardware wallet software's receive tab should be fine.
@_date: 2017-02-20 14:35:45
you don't need one. Just write a simple 5 line python script to listen to the port, check the request for the path in the first line of the HTTP request, parse the info given after that using standard libraries and then use python to do whatever it is you want it to do... you could probably do something similar with a couple lines of perl, nodejs, ruby, or anything really.
If you are planning to do it manually, why not just bookmark the address on blockcypher or some other blockchain explorer and check it manually?

Data size is primarily decided by the number of inputs used.
Let's say I want to send my whole balance of 10 bitcoins somewhere.
If my balance was acquired in one transaction for 10 BTC, I only have one possible input to use, so my transaction will have one input and one output.
If my balance was acquired over the span of 10 transactions, each sending me 1 BTC, I have 10 possible inputs, and since I am sending them all my transaction will have 10 inputs and 1 output.
Also, a slight note, if you aren't sending the entirety of your inputs (let's say 9.5 BTC in our example) you must send the remainder (roughly 0.5 BTC) back to your own wallet, and because of this most transactions have 2 outputs.
Now once you know how many inputs and outputs your transaction will have, the estimated size of a single signature P2PKH compressed pubkey wallet (if not multisig, most are this) is below:
    (10 + (inputs * 148) + (outputs * 34))
So 1 input 1 output is 192 bytes
1 input 2 outputs is 226 bytes
10 inputs 2 outputs is 1558 bytes
So on.
In actuality, there's a 1/2 chance each input could be 147 bytes, and outputs sending to P2SH addresses are 32 bytes instead of 34, but we would rather slightly overestimate than underestimate.

I see the work you've done. This is also true that balance discovery would require at the very least a full-block SPV type situation.
However, the wallet would have a very long load time on wake to query each block since last connected, then parse every transaction searching for valid Stealth OP_RETURNs (not BIP47)... The usability would be unbearable.

I find it interesting. Spending a utxo publishes your pubkey in the blockchain where it is guaranteed to be recorded for as long as bitcoin is relevant.
However, publishing this signature on the internet is not as certain a guarantee that it will never be lost or altered (he pays off the server admins to replace with fake sig later on / pays google to replace their caches)
But the assumption we make is that this signature will now be extremely difficult to erase from history... 
And yet, when you compare it to the bitcoin ledger, it's like the difference between 0.0001 and 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001

34 bytes per output with P2PKH, however the scriptPubkey itself is 25 bytes, then one byte for the scriptLen, and 8 bytes for the satoshi amount. Total 34 bytes.
A single sig P2SH is a 32 byte output, 23 byte scriptPubkey. However, it increases the size of the scriptSig when spent, too. So if we include the size of the redeemScript, we would add 34 bytes for a pushop and pubkey, then checksig, then the pushop for the redeemscript. So 36 bytes added to scriptSig.
However, since P2SH single sig doesn't need the pubkey in the scriptSig (since it's in the redeemscript) it removes 34 bytes from the scriptSig. Meaning it actually only adds 2 bytes to scriptSig compared to P2PKH.
Which is crossed out by the 2 bytes saved on the output.
tl;dr, overall, they're the exact same, except outs are 2 bytes less and ins are 2 bytes more

All these tips you're getting will help you get your feet wet in bitcoin.
However, I would highly recommend not "betting the farm" on bitcoin, as there are still some glaring issues that have yet to be solved from a technical standpoint. (throws up downvote shield)
I am a huge supporter of bitcoin, I get my friends to start using it whenever I can, and I think if you have a lot of places you can use it around you (remember, a lot of stores can accept bitcoins through giftcards on gyft or eGifter, both accept bitcoin), definitely consider topping up your bitcoin wallet with enough spending cash for the week or few days, or whatever you're comfortable with.
The "maintenance fees" of prepaid debit cards are pretty outrageous, not to mention the fee per transaction of prepaid debit... so even if bitcoin loses a few % over the week, you're better off.
Granted, bitcoin could plummet 10-20% or soar to 1000% in the span of a few days... you never know.
It's high risk, so I would not put all my money in bitcoin and replace my bank account outright... but I would definitely consider using it instead of prepaid debit if you can get bitcoin accepted at the places you want it to. (remember gyft and eGifter too)
As far as wallet schemes go, I would recommend you going with a deterministic approach.
If you have android, download "Wallet32" which will give you a 12 word phrase. These 12 words can be written down and used to restore every Bitcoin Address you can ever make with the app. (using magic ;-) )
The 12 word solution's strong point: write it down, store it in a safe. If your android explodes, your bitcoins are safe, as inputting that 12 word phrase will regenerate all your addresses, no matter how many you used.
You will, however, want to be careful and put a lock on your phone. (PIN code, etc.)
If you have any questions about using the various wallets, is a great resource, search past questions there.
Either way, withdraw your tips from ChangeTip, and play around with some of the wallet software to get a feel for it.
If you have iPhone, Coinbase just came out with their app, and blockchain.info is on their way... Also, in a few months, Electrum may release their new Kivy-based mobile client on iOS. (the Electrum kivy mobile client will first come out on Android though)
EDIT: apparently a deterministic open source wallet just came out for iPhone called breadwallet.  I would recommend trying it out.
With android, the "Wallet32" app I talked about looks promising, also "Mycelium" is great for it's "Local buy/sell" feature with GPS to find bitcoin sellers/buyers near you.
PC I would recommend Electrum.
Some centralized approaches that can lower headache of management but at a higher counter-party risk, Coinbase, blockchain.info, GreenAddress.it (also coming out with an iOS version soon).
Right now the Bitcoin space requires a lot of knowledge on who's trustworthy. The system requires no trust, but the tools to use the system need to be either verified (open source) or trusted (closed source, a la coinbase etc.) in order to protect your bitcoins.
Hope you enjoy playing around with bitcoins. $2 @_date: 2016-01-05 16:05:55
The merchant doesn't see the transaction, because their merchant app isn't stupid, and hides the RBF transaction from them until it's in a block.
The customer gets pissed and has to pay with cash.
Either the customer stops using that stupid wallet, or stops using Bitcoin altogether.
Assuming all RBF at coffee shops done intentionally by users are malicious, he'll likely try to pull it at another store. This other store will also not be using a stupid wallet, and will not accept 0 conf RBF, or even acknowledge it.
RBF transactions have no place in POS. They should be ignored until in a block.
They are meant for exchanges to reorder their utxos and scorch their earths or some shit like that \*waves hands\*, bitpay, and any sane merchant payment provider will not acknowledge RBF before 1-conf, and thus wallets will not generate RBFs in favor of user experience.
Edit: then some clown will sneak a commit into the reference client making all transactions RBF, because their goal was thwarted by stupid market forces again. It will be linked to reddit, and drama repeats ad nauseum until we're all forced to use Lightning Network or Coinbase.

A TON extra.
To give an idea, an average transaction is 230 bytes (ish) and 8 bytes of each output is used to represent the send amount. (Which is what CT hides)

Unupgraded nodes will just ignore the witness data, but the transactions will still be valid by old rules.

Do you even understand how software works?
He is obviously not talking about forking the blockchain, he's talking about forking the software. Bitcoin classic is a software fork AND will eventually contain a BLOCKCHAIN hard fork. But even if it never raised the block limit, it would still be called a "fork" as it is a software forked from Core.
He is talking about enterprise geared software based off open source.
With linux, if a company used some obscure fork of Linux that had a small community, or even a large fork with a huge community, that company still doesn't have a contract with anyone, so no one to take responsibility except themselves.
It is ridiculous to expect every company to have a dedicated team to maintaining Linux updates and compatibility with their (likely outsourced) internal proprietary software, so they hire a company to take care of the linux stuff for them and a company to handle other software stuff.
That company is Red Hat. They basically maintain their own linux version that they open to customers and give guarantees, warrantees and what not.
Basically he is saying that some fork that is 100% in full consensus with the network could be used in a for-hire Bitcoin tech managing service for enterprise.
"But what if they scammed their customers?!"
If RedHat wanted to scam people, they could easily make away with millions of dollars. But they don't.
If "CryptsyHat" appears trying to be the RedHat of bitcoin without an address and without any names or registration with regulatory authorities, it would be dumb to partner with them.
If CoinBase ran "CoinHat" or something, I would feel safe leaving companies in their hands.
Anyone with the resources, spin your own distro, for everyone else theres redhat. Same logic could work with bitcoin.

As an example: here's a super simple site that parses the parser block data to recreate the blockheader
Then you just need to encode the transaction count into varint, stick it at the end, then stick every raw transaction at the end in the exact order they show up in the blockr.io tx hash list.

BIP47 != Stealth addresses
The ones being discussed (in darkwallet) require checking every transaction to see if it's yours or not.
Arcbit supports BIP47 which I can tell by virtue of it syncing fast. (You need the private keys to check whether the transaction is yours or not)
BTW, darkwallet synced pretty fast because not many people were using it, and the unsystem server was gathering stealth transactions so that users didn't need to sift through the blockchain, and just queried all stealth transactions since last time and checked each one locally using javascript........... (if everyone started using it, it would suddenly take forever to check everything)
@_date: 2017-03-13 01:05:24
SegWit completely fixes malleability.
The caveat is that the "fixed" transactions are only the ones using inputs from segwit utxos.
Basically, in order for "there will never be a malleable transaction ever again. No longer possible." We would need every single bitcoin on the network to be spent once and sent to a newly created segwit output (address etc).
Whereas, with a hardfork we could say "regardless of the utxo type, we will force witness segregation for all utxos." And even satoshi's bitcoin would be spendable without malleability.
However, this narrative is kind of funny... because before, the narrative was "OMG SEGWIT REQUIRES WALLETS TO UPGRADE SO UNFAIR OMGOMG" (when in actuality it would be opt-in) and their "completely solve malleability" solution would ACTUALLY force all wallets to change or else be rejected as an invalid transaction.

Really a chain split can only happen if miners' software doesn't agree.
A full node on the network can merely slow down block propagation by refusing to view it as valid.
But seeing as all the major mining pools have a private network solely for sending blocks to each other directly, UASF won't do much damage and probably won't work.
However, having an overwhelming number of nodes just deciding to stop processing blocks (aka, what would happen if most nodes rejected non-signalling blocks even though the blockchain continued growing without them) would definitely hurt the network.
Though I don't see how it could hard fork the network unless some miners started adopting it.

Because it breaks one of the IsStandard() rules of any Core client for the past x years. AND we know for a fact that blockchain.info just accepts ALL transactions generated by its app without verifying them.
So unless blockchain.info is mining with their nodes (Which would be a huge problem, as they once accepted a transaction sending some of Satoshi's coins (that had an invalid signature) as valid and had to manually remove the transaction from their site.) the user will likely never get mined unless some miner decides to mine it. (some miners ignore IsStandard())

Meh, Add 2-3 more cents-ish and see if it sticks. I'm sure you've got nothing better to do than sit around monitoring network activity and trying to respend when confirmation looks slow. (Remember, no wallet is going to sit there for you. And even if it did, good luck using a mobile client. Have fun with 0 battery life as your wallet is checking a millions factors every second in your pocket because it needs to add a few cents)
Don't worry you can use a broken new feature as a crutch to help you with the broken fee system.
Oh, but you'll have to do it manually using your knowledge of programming, as no wallet in their right mind is going to try adding the RBF flag to a transaction, because you'll basically be ignored by any wallet, as most wallets are moving towards ignoring RBF transactions until seen in a block.
But 1,000,000 crutches added as default node policy are way better than... Oh wait, I've said too much.
@_date: 2016-01-11 03:05:36
0-conf will continue to work on the honor system after rbf is required on all transactions. The only difference is that in a world where rbf doesn't exist, or a non-100% share of the mining power supports rbf, the possibility of a successful double spend falls from 100% towards a volatile lower range (rising when new exploitable updates are rolled out and lowering when node policy starts to solidify.)
My view on the matter is that rbf provides 0 value to anyone. The utxo reorganization argument is a ruse, and no company wants, or needs rbf.
Now that begs the question: then why rbf?
Mining fees? &gt; No, right now, a loss of usability in the eyes of the public would hurt bitcoin's price more than any gains realized by adding and extra cent or two per block. No logical miner would implement the policy until fees became more of a game changer. (Not to mention there is currently a lack of demand elasticity that will prevent small blocks from "creating a fee market" at this point in the ecosystem anyways. So "a few cents" won't turn into "a few dollars" anytime soon.
So the real reason is... What?
If you want to go with the tin foil hat crowd it's obvious that the NSA, FBI, Blockstream, and every other outlet for conspiracies is responsible, as they want to ruin bitcoin/artificially create demand for some product they want to sell that will "solve" 0-conf for us.
Fortunately, I'm all out of tin foil, so I am fresh out of ideas.
I would like to see one real life example where rbf will create significant (like even 1% of revenue) value for anyone. Otherwise, the only people with answers are either all talk, or tin foil enthusiasts.

Why would this be a bad thing?
1. Miners vote small blocks for the goal of getting more fees
2. Users "vote" lower fees with their actions. Users stop using Bitcoin and/or use off-chain that lowers fees for miners.
3. Miners lose
1. Miners want to push all the small players out of the network by creating 5 GB blocks that only they (supposedly some super awesome facility that only they own) can handle.
2. Other miners vote downward to counteract.
3. If the miner has too much hashing power, and they continue to drag up way beyond what is socially considered "normal scaling" people start sounding the alarms.
4. If they're a pool, miners leave them, if they're a lone operation, then blocksize is the LEAST of our problems because we have a 51% attack on our hands. Pick your poison, Bitcoin is dying.
Please tell me why it is bad to leave it to miners to decide. I understand we want to assume malice in the miner majority as a precaution, but if we want to assume a malice driven single entity with more than 51% as a starting point, don't you think that's going too far, and every argument falls apart?
What should be the base assumption we want to try and defend against? A pool with 30% or more, and run by a govt. out to kill Bitcoin?
I think if everyone is thinking in their economic best interests, a dynamic limit decided by miners is a reasonable method of deciding block limit.

1. No room for versioning information, so backwards compatibility later on is a pain.
2. The checksum relies on the wordlist, so the BIP contradicts itself. It claims the protocol is wordlist agnostic and you don't need the wordlist to generate the seed, and yet the checksum requires the wordlist to check. So it's either check the checksum and require the wordlist or don't. All wallets chose to check the checksum.
Electrum's new phrases contains version info and the checksum is brute forced upon creation so that you don't need the wordlist to check the checksum.

For Electrum only.
Lots of people get confused, as the old Electrum phrases AND the new Electrum phrases are BOTH not compatible with the phrases generated by, say Mycelium.
Then to confuse matters worse, Electrum has a mode where you can import a phrase from Trezor (using BIP39+BIP44 just like Mycelium) and use the wallet as is.
Electrum having the old phrases and wanting to keep backwards compatibility is understandable, but the fact that Thomas took a stance against BIP39 while using the BIP39 recommended English wordlist was a bad choice IMO.

I worked on the stealth address protocol for a while on some of the multisig aspects.
I even had a branch of Electrum that would support sending TO stealth addresses up and running.
But balance discovery was a huge problem. The more people use Stealth addresses, the higher the anonymity, but also the higher the cost of discovering balances.
I did some tests where it would take my wallet a couple hours to discover the balances it received in the previous 24 hours (under assumption that only 20% of all transactions used it)
This is why the only valid way to use stealth addresses was to have a 24/7 node running and checking for stealth balance during its normal transaction processing routine, then batch the results and send them to the client via request/response type structure...
Then everyone from Darkwallet fell off the face of the Earth. The wiki I was updating disappeared, and someone came out with BIP47.
BIP47 kind of deals with the same problem, but this time requires a pairing transaction to take place... which is kind of like opening a payment channel, except every transaction takes place on the blockchain.
If I wanted to send one transaction to you and never sent to you again, I would need to send two separate transactions to the bitcoin network and get then confirmed to accomplish this.

BIP70 prevents rogue Chrome Extensions / Mobile apps from replacing the QR code by directly modifying the DOM.
The problem with Chrome Extensions is they auto-update, and a lot of times companies buy existing extensions with the intent of auto-updating and using existing permissions to replace ads or add more ads into sites.
There have been instances of price ticker apps replacing addresses and QR images in the DOM. (https wouldn't help here)
There is only one example I know where an SSL cert was made for a tor onion address. blockchain.info... but even so, most wallets even if they had BIP70 support would not be able to send an http request via tor I'm sure.
The answer of course would be to disable the r attribute for Tor users. Unless Tor has extensions, accessing Tor should be sufficient.
But for https users, BIP70 is a definite security boost........................... if only more wallets supported it.
The bigger ones do though, so I really recommend implementing it... but I guess it's not a huge priority if you've never had a user complain about something like that. (payment gone missing etc)

First of all: dust limit is a node policy, so each node has a different one, but most follow Bitcoin Core.
Currently min_relay_tx_fee is 50 bits in Core, so the dust limit is 27.3 bits for those nodes.
Other nodes might have the old 10 bit relay fee minimum which would make their dust limit 5.46 bits.
Some nodes might have 100 bit due to recent stress tests etc. which would mean 54.6 bits.

Yea, but if your whole goal in running those machines was to "look organic" you wouldn't want to do that.
So now you are faced with the question "how slow is organic upgrading?"
Too slow and you have a low active node count (not good) too high and you get suspicions that you're not organic (not good) so you guess that a few hours is reasonable enough that any claims of astroturfing can be brushed off with plausible deniability.
However, anyone who has watched upgrade patterns of critical updates in Bitcoin before know that this speed they chose was not as plausible as they think.
Plausible enough for the Kool-aid crew to deny it though.

The term "Core" didn't exist until Bitcoin Classic used it to smear the people with commit access (useless) to bitcoin/bitcoin.
Then a large number of developers who worked on bitcoin frequently decided to join together to make a positive message to counteract the anti-core message.
In other words, until Classic tried to destroy bitcoin, "Core" was just a decentralized group of people who don't trust each other, which is why every non-trivial change to the codebase is peer reviewed in pull requests by hundreds of devs (most of which don't have commit access).
I forgot the name of the phenomena, but if a group of people otherwise unrelated are attacked, they are more likely to join together and stick together.
However, much to the chagrin of Gavin (who probably wishes he had installed himself as the benevolent dictator style maintainer), peer review didn't like his idea to hard fork, and the bitcoin network feature of upgrade inertia (it's hard to budge it, but when it moves it moves fast and then stops again) worked against him. So he needed to get critical mass of the community to believe everyone but him was crazy.
Thus the proper noun Core was born.

Solution: convince them to believe in 2MB, and now Classic is just another non-contentious implementation like libbitcoin.
Everyone saves face, everyone agrees, consensus achieved.
Just because someone states "I will never support xyz" does not mean anyone trying to convince them to change their mind is bad.
No one wants to crash cars, but if Core and Classic get into a game of chicken and it looks like Classic is going to win the miners over, Core will merge the 2 MB code, sour grapes will quit bitcoin, and those who can swallow their pride will move on and continue working on Core with 2MB.
The strategy right now is to remove as much fuel from classic's engine to prevent them from even engaging in the chicken fight to begin with.
Another strategy (which lukejr is implementing roght now) is to challenge the opponent (miners who agree with 2MB) to another game of chicken. Say they actually get momentum and Classic is about to win...
"Well, it would be a shame if your pretty ASICs were rendered useless by a POW algo change."

You've never heard of bcrypt, pbkdf, pbkdf2, or any other password salt hashing function that takes an iterations integer as an argument?
I would argue that single hashing a password and salt IS rolling your own, and bcrypt etc. would be the libraries you want to use. (afaik bcrypt aims for 1 second of calculation per password on an average desktop with its default iteration setting)
If a hacker gets your pw hash tables, and they want to target a high profile user of yours, the longer each attempt at the password takes, the longer your user has to take action before they are compromised.
It's a compromise between performance and security. Usually you want to aim for 1 second per guess... But it's up to you where you place the target.
NBitcoin is an amazing library for .NET
There should be a class for HD keys which is instantiated with a random seed, and subsequent keys are derived using an 31 bit index integer. (because the msb (bit 0) should be 0 if soft and 1 if hard derivation, so technically it's a 32 bit signed int where negative indicies are hard and positive are soft)

Bitcoin was based on the idea that "miners being greedy" is THE REASON why we have a decentralized currency. It's the main reason why it works.
The problem is that we're working with different information sets, and knowledge.
Someone who is knowledgeable on development practices and how stable software is made would look at the BU team and understand "wow, trusting these guys to run the network will end badly for all of us"
However, someone who mines doesn't understand that internally, they don't digest that reality. What they DO understand is "fees are going up. blocks are full and mempools are filling frequently. If fees are too high, users stop using Bitcoin. Bitcoin without users is bad for our bottom line." and whether that is 100% true or not, they act under the assumption that "anything that increases block size is good for our bottom line."
I'm not trying to say they're dumb. However, they are misinformed (some cases, intentionally) about the facts, and we as a community have done a poor job in convincing them otherwise.
My first job out of college had me writing up 100 proposals in my first year and every single one got shot down... I eventually asked my boss why they even hired me if all I had done was just throw proposals at a brick wall. My boss (who was a very famous producer in the industry since the early 90s) said something I think rings true.
"If people don't budge, it's your fault for not making them budge or quitting. If you are 100% certain they will never budge, you are wasting the company's money and your own time."
I think the "quitting" part is what I have seen being thrown around with the POW algo change... but I think that the miners can still be convinced... no one can say when it's 100% apparent that they will never budge.

I can tell you from experience, and trust me, I have heard every kind of bitcoin loss story you could imagine, 80% or more of ALL lost bitcoin horror stories are based off of the simplest mistakes.
Most often: "I forgot my password, help me crack it."
Then there's: "I split my key using SSSS but I forgot which library I used and the tool is gone and I'm not a programmer and I lost two of the pieces and nnnnnnggggggg..."
Then there was the one time where some guy messaged me asking if Electrum stored encrypted backups like blockchain.info, because his girlfriend ripped up his paper with the phrase on it.
So every time I see a wall-o-text explaining how someone created a fool proof way to manage their bitcoins with the main goal of "defending mah keys from teh haxxorz" is usually so amazingly convoluted that two, three, ten years down the line, you are more likely to have your house catch on fire, or your girlfriend accidentally throw it out, or plain old "oops, I done goofed" the more complicated it gets.
There is a mantra that many in the bitcoin community subscribe to, called KISS (keep it simple stupid).
1. bitaddress uses the CSPRNG built into most modern web browsers in ADDITION to 2-3 minutes of mouse wiggling and keyboard nonsense to add to the entropy. This CSPRNG + mouse + keyboard combo is used as a seed to generate all keys on every window of the site, so as long as you don't close your browser, the site will have plenty of entropy, and by copy pasting things that you are assuming has good entropy, you are completely circumventing a VERY GOOD entropy source for your home-made solution. If anything, paste your block stuff into the textbox during the entropy gathering phase. Then you can generate as many keys as you want, and they are all as random as the first key you generate.
2. If you are going to store your keys somewhere, don't split it into tiny pieces and spin it into a necklace or embed it into a picture of a wolf or something. Print it onto a piece of paper, and store it in a safe like you would with wads of cash. I know it sounds tempting, because wit crypto there are a lot of cool things you CAN do, and that makes you feel cool... but it's security theater, and not meaningful in any way.
3. If you are seriously worried about someone stealing your paper wallet somehow, I recommend encrypting it using BIP38 (the bitaddress main page lets you check "encrypt keys" and enter a password) and using an EASILY REMEMBERED, but HARD TO GUESS password. In other words, something that no one around you could guess easily. BIP38 is extremely slow to decrypt, so one password guess would take a fairly good computer a second or two to attempt...
4. If you are worried about being forced to send bitcoins under duress, you need plausible deniability. This can be found in BIP39 phrases as they use a special passphrase (which is optional) that will change your wallet based on the passphrase hash. So you could store 10 BTC in "bobbylovesjane" password wallet, and then the rest of your 10000BTC in "actuallyhorsesarebetterthanbatterieswhenyouthinkaboutit" or whatever your password is... then when they monkey wrench your kneecaps, resist a bit and then finally "spill the beans" with bobbylovesjane. As long as they don't know how much you own, they'll probably walk away with the 10 BTC and leave you alone hopefully. (but if they find out about the other one, give it to them... your life is precious.)
tl;dr: 99% of support tickets and worried private messages I have ever received were due to people over-engineering complicated solutions to simple problems.

Yes, yes, and depends on whether you know how to compile bitcoind. If you can figure it out, the patches made to bitcoind to allow nodejs bindings has nothing to do with consensus code, so patching the new bitcoind version on your own should be simple.
However, bitcore team is actually funded, so they are very good with timely updates. Every time a new bitcoind comes out, they bundle the new patched binary into a new version of bitcore on npm.

Hi there, here's some recommendations for people who are new and "dont really know a lot about this."
1. Choose a wallet that handles fees for you automatically. Some good ones are breadwallet for iPhone, Copay for Android / Desktop to name a few.
2. Your transaction will get stuck for a while, but once it seems to be gone from the block explorers, you will need to perform a command in Bitcoin Core called zapwallettx or something like that.
Welcome to bitcoin, sorry you somehow fell into using the least user-friendly wallet from the get go. Bitcoin's not all that bad.

Sellers want to sell as high as possible. Buyers want to buy as low as possible.
If the lowest seller and the highest buyer overlapped, then logically they would just make a trade with each other. Completely logical.
This is why the bids and asks (static offers to buy or sell) get fewer as they approach touching each other, as once they get pretty close, someone comes along and says... "well, I COULD wait for a taker to buy my bitcoin for 680 bucks... but there's a guy looking to buy one for 677 bucks... and risking the wait is not something I want to do, so I might just cross the gap and sell to that guy.
This is what a market is. Economics 101.

You mean 0.0001 BTC... aka about $0.05. When your transaction was 41681 bytes large.
Lesson learned: blockchain.info is a bad wallet. Try using another wallet like Mycelium (for Android) or breadwallet (for iPhone) both of them have a sweep feature where you just scan the private key and send (and they actually calculate rational fees instead of "generous" 5 cents)

I personally recommend using bitcore (nodejs bindings to bitcoind) to run your own bitcore wallet service and connecting to that from Copay.
While the bitcoin wallet for Android, and Electrum allow you to utilize your own full node for verification through an SPV wallet, Copay was the easiest to set up and supports the most platforms via Copay.

@_date: 2016-06-19 15:34:50
no... just... no...
Please look up hardened derivation before you say things that are factually incorrect.
Each account in the method I explained is derived hardened (as per BIP44 specs) all the way down to the account key. This means that there is no way to use that weakness past the key that we generate from the account key.
Knowing m/44'/0'/1' xprv and m/44'/0'/0' xpub can NOT calculate m/44'/0'/0' xprv due to hardened derivation.
Edit to clarify: even if they weren't hardened, you would need m/44'/0'/1 xprv and m/44'/0' xpub. having m/44'/0'/1 xprv and m/44'/0'/0 xpub would not let you find m/44'/0' xprv.

Copay also accepts Mycelium seed. Select "Create New Personal Wallet" or something like that.
The only thing that's kind of counter intuitive is:
1. If you create a wallet on Copay using phrase A.
2. Then you delete your Copay wallet.
3. Then you want to restore the same wallet from phrase A.
4. You need to use "Restore wallet" instead of "Create Wallet" because Copay's server still sees your public key as "existing" on the server, so if you use "Create Wallet" you'll get an "Already Exists" error.
Don't worry, the private keys are always ONLY on your device... but the metadata lives on their servers. (Mycelium's backend servers are not open source, so likely the same can be said for Mycelium... they might say "no we don't store metadata" but we have to take their word for it)
Edit: Also, Electrum servers are run by volunteers and is open source, so the servers could be storing whatever data they want about you (obviously Electrum doesn't send private key data, but still)
tl;dr privacy is hard in bitcoin. I just installed my own Copay server and use that with my own bitcoin node. hooray for privacy.

Any wallet that calculates the fee without letting the user modify it automatically gets someone on github complaining about "let us set the fee!!!"
Then, no matter how much you obfuscate it, if you give the user the ability to turn off or modify the fee, new users will find it, and turn it down as far as they can.
You can never win in wallet development.

Use the request feature and ignore the amount.
The request feature will let you generate unlimited addresses and keep track of which one you sent to whom.
If you lose your wallet file or forget how many addresses you gave out, add "gap_limit": 200, to you wallet file after restoring and it will find all your addresses. (Or a smaller number, doesn't matter... just large enough to cover all the addresses you gave out.

Running patched Core *does* worry you?
Even if you're not a programmer, the patch is very straight forward, not much to screw up. Consensus code is untouched. Not to mention bitcore has tons of testing code for high coverage.
I was recommending bitcore and using a web server to proxy requests using https because usability is great considering the amount of privacy.

Any output with an amount less than 2730 satoshis (0.0000273 BTC) will have trouble propagating, as a large amount of nodes have upgraded to a min relay fee of 0.00005 BTC.

So if I sent a transaction with the sole intent of congesting the network, and stuck 100 sat/byte fee on it, that's not spam, but if some newbie accidentally clicks the wrong button on blockchain.info when sending to a bitpay payment qr, and sends 0 fee they are spam.

Apple is essentially saying that you can interact with the device's iMessage through a little window in the iMessage app.
That doesn't mean you can access the other side of the message's user's device and its info... that would seem extremely insecure.
How would the breadwallet app be able to gather information from the recipient about their sending credentials (addresses, signed utxos, whatever) without the other user also having breadwallet installed, activated on iMessage, and breadwallet holding metadata about users?

You can do this with Copay. It's just reaaaaaally complicated. And there's no way to make this not complicated, as you can't make a hot key cold, so you have to jump through the hoops of generating a secure cold key, and split off a hardened xprv to use for online wallet.
1. Generate a BIP39 phrase offline using some tool or something. ( you can download this from github and run it offline. Input your own entropy if you'd like, and also the page is constantly recording mouse movements and keyboard presses for use in the entropy generator)
2. Write down the phrase, re-enter it manually just in case and make sure the same keys show up.
3. Click "Custom Derivation Path" and type in m/44'/0'/0' (don't forget the apostrophes) and copy the "Derived Public Key" into a text file, this is to create a watch only wallet.
4. In the same place, type in m/44'/0'/1' and copy the "Derived Private Key" into a text file. This is for your spending wallet.
5. take the text file online, and create a new personal use wallet (not multisig) and in advanced options, paste in the xprv extended private key.
6. Now you have a hot wallet based off the 2nd account of your cold wallet.
7. Take the xpub and import into Electrum, or if you're a coder, install bitcore-wallet-client and instanciate a new BWS account using seedFromExtendedPublicKey, export that account to a file, and import it into copay. (Copay can not currently create a new wallet from an xpub, but bwc can)
Now you have a watch-only of the first account, a spending hot wallet of the second account, and the master mnemonic phrase (main key) is still cold.
Edit: An interesting plus of this method is that if you recover the mnemonic into Mycelium (or Electrum if you set it to "restore a trezor wallet"), it will recover both accounts so you can send from both of them.

Electrum's watch only wallet takes an xpub and generates addresses, so you don't even need to use an Electrum wallet to create the private key... you could use Trezor or Copay or Mycelium, or whatever.
1. Create wallet on Trezor or Copay or Mycelium or Electrum.
2. Write down secret phrase and keep it in a safe place.
3. Find the xpub master public key for your account. (In Electrum it's under "Master Public Key", in Copay it's under wallet details in advanced settings, in Mycelium it's also in some deep setting.) It is a looooong string of letters and numbers that starts with the letters "xpub" ("xprv" is the master private key, so be careful)
4. Open ssh to your server (assuming your server has electrum installed)
    user ~ $ electrum restore xpub6DV2FQLqrSz63tHUnkYKMzS9WBFDQhT9Vt7MkSzzAfmTmcrjCEp6YrGHD797th6wjAhaVWQLLcrH3kTyrqFJZtiJkBFUPCzMR4cwiiT3JsQ

        "1LPAbH1A3TKw44gUA9F9ip5tQtuofo4Ne6"
    ]
however, if it is not "default_wallet" you must specify the wallet file with every command you type, like this:
    electrum listaddresses -w /path/to/wallet/this_is_your_wallet_file
anywho, since you're only using your server for one electrum merchant, I'm sure you should only use default_wallet... but if you need multiple, I'm sure setconfig can help you with using different wallets for different instances.
if you see the addresses from listaddresses and they match the addresses on your wallet that you created the private keys on, then you are good. just leave that wallet on your server and the worst that could happen is a hacker knows all your addresses (or replaces your xpub with their xpub and steals some money from your customers)

If the block mining is based on coins held, but the coins can only be generated by the blockchain, which is generated based on coins held...
Let's say we have a 5000 block chain currently. With POW it will provably take me so long that I will never catch up with the main chain unless I have 51% of the mining power, in which case I could just attack by forking off the tip.
In POS it is much harder to fork off the tip, but way easier to fake the blockchain from block 0. (I just mine all coins in all blocks and I immediately have 100% of the mining power, so I can trick someone into believing MY 5000 block chain is the best one they should follow.

1. It's great.
2. Good thing it's just a conspiracy like 9/11 truthers and flat-earthers.
3. A couple Core devs are getting paid to concentrate on Bitcoin solely, but most importantly, it is only a small minority of code contributors.
4. Bitcoin Classic, XT, Unlimited, Cash, blah blah blah did not fail because The dragons den has a death grip on the bitcoin/bitcoin repository on Github and therefore they control the minds of all developers... they failed because no skilled developers supported their cause. (and a few skilled developers trolled them, to boot)
5. If every dev besides the "dragon's den" left bitcoin/bitcoin to code for Bitcoin Cash, I would most likely gladly join them and support Cash, under the logic that if such an exodus happened, new convincing information would be available... but barely anyone does. Why? Because a large majority of competent developers see "8MB blocks with adjustable limit completely controlled by Chinese mining cartels" as MAAAAAYBE being a bad thing for Bitcoin.
Also, you made no assertions, so how can you be wrong? You asked for thoughts and opinions.

so no computers? no node.js or python or C++ or any other libraries?
kinda hard to do by hand... :-P
btw, you don't need 256. 128 bits of entropy is the maximum security possible on the SECP256k1 curve of ECC that bitcoin uses. because efficiencies found have lowered keysize to entropy granted ratio to n/2.
in other words. feeding 128 bits of entropy and hashing it to 256 keysize will theorhetically grant you the same security as generating a 256 bit key, assuming the hashing algorithm is secure... but BIP39 will use SHA based hashing either way, so that's not really a factor here.
tl;dr 12 words is enough. anything more is just security theater. Trezor even makes it so when you restore a 12 word phrase it will give you dummy words to type in to make every recovery process involve typing 24 words.
if you're ok with using python, BIP39 is easy:
    import hashlib
    def main():
        global WORDLIST
        binary_string = "..........."
        data = ("%064x" % int(binary_string,2)).decode('hex')[-len(binary_string)//8:]
        if len(data) not in [16, 20, 24, 28, 32]:
            raise ValueError('Data length should be one of the following: [16, 20, 24, 28, 32], but it is not (%d).' % len(data))
        h = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()
        b = bin(int(data.encode('hex'), 16))[2:].zfill(len(data) * 8) + \
            bin(int(h, 16))[2:].zfill(256)[:len(data) * 8 // 32]
        result = []
        for i in range(len(b) // 11):
            idx = int(b[i * 11:(i + 1) * 11], 2)
            result.append(WORDLIST[idx])
        result_phrase = ' '.join(result)

You just explained the difference: difficulty of arbitrage.
A perfect market would have people doing exactly what you are thinking of doing; buying cheap in the US and selling high in KR.
Eventually US price would be brought up and KR price brought down to an equillibrium.
I remember KR has a lot of laws about using some sort of social government ID number to register for social media... is that necessary for account on Korbit? This is a hurdle for foreigners to enter your market. Also, it is also difficult for Koreans to create accounts with exchanges overseas as well, so I think that is also difficult.
We have the same thing happening in Japan. Our price is higher.
It is because of difficulty of transferring money from KRW to USD and making accounts over seas.

When you set up a public node, you negotiate fees explicitly on a per request basis. So when you query for the distribution graph, you get the latest fees from all the public nodes. one satoshi here, maybe 3% of value over there, maybe 3 satoshis from Bob, but the second you start querying the graph constantly, my node can say "ok, for everyone else, 1 satoshi, for the jackoffs on my shit list I charge 500 satoshis per transaction"
So unless you made a new node for every transaction, which each requires an on-chain transaction, which can not be done billions of times a second... then no, it's not practical.
Just as bitcoin core scores peers and eventually punishes them for bad behavior, LN nodes will as well.

Compressed addresses are hashes of the compression byte and the 32 byte x value.
Uncompressed addresses are hashes of the compression byte 0x04 followed by the full 64 byte pubkey.
Since there is no way to know whether you hashed the short or long pubkey, private keys in bitcoin include an extra 0x01 byte at the end of the 32 byte private key for compressed keys when encoding the WIF private key.
Hope that answered your question. You can hash either one. Though uncompressed just takes up more transaction space and costs you more in fees.

@_date: 2016-06-18 03:37:33
Because you essentially just described multi-sig. Just a different way to manage keys.
The only advantage to using ssss instead of P2SH multisig is the transaction size savings (thus saving fees) but in exchange, the security is lowered and the complexity of the setup is increased.
ie. With multisig, I have 2 keys one on each device, maybe a 3rd backup key offline. If one device is hacked, the hacker only gets one key. I can recover without losing funds. With a ssss setup, the "password" being a second key would mean I have to input the key onto the same device (you need to have both secrets on the same device to reconstruct the shared secret) which means that the hacker probably has all the keys they need to steal.

Actually, you probably could do that, but it would require:
1. manually changing the format of the coinb.in unsigned transaction into the transaction-for-signing format. (adding sighash and substituting the scriptPubkey in the inputs)
2. Converting that from hex to binary (I don't know if you can copy paste NUL bytes into Android apps? that might be a problem) and paste into the message to sign.
3. Take the signature and decode the base64 into hex, extract the signature, calculate the pubkey, and place them into the original unsigned transaction in the proper place.
That should theoretically work if you can paste 0x00 bytes and the like into a textbox on Android apps.
tl;dr, Not really.

Out of curiosity, were all of these transactions using confirmed utxos when first broadcasted?

The only fees in Copay/bitpay app(s) is the bitcoin network fee.
This fee does not go to Bitpay, but rather it goes to the maintainers of the Bitcoin network (known as miners)
In the current state of the Bitcoin network, If you do not allocate a fee in your transaction, your transaction will not be processed...
So in order to avoid usability problems, Copay does not allow the user to set a 0 fee, and dynamically tries to calculate the proper fee to get your transaction processed in a timely manner.
Bitcoin network fees are only paid by the sender, so receiving bitcoin is free. However, if you received 5 BTC over the course of 10 transactions, you would have to pay about 8 times more fees to spend that 5 BTC than if you had received that 5 BTC over the course of 1 transaction.
That is because transaction fees are calculated on a per byte basis (bigger data, bigger fee) and every time you send bitcoin, you must tell the network which transaction you received that bitcoin in. The more transactions you need to tell the network about, the more data your spending transaction takes up, the more fees you must pay.
At this point, referring to one transaction adds about 150 bytes to your transaction, and currently 0.0000014 BTC per byte is the rate that will get you processed quickly.
Which means, any time you receive 0.00021 BTC or less, it will cost you more bitcoin to include that in a transaction. (Copay actually takes this into account and will ignore these transactions in your history until fees go down a little more when making a spending transaction)
tl;dr: fees don't go to Bitpay, and Copay (or Bitpay, they're basically the same) is a good app, because it manages the complex parts for you... oh, also, Bitcoin is not free, fees are required for all practical purposes.

Electrum uses urandom to seed new wallets, bitaddress uses mouse and keyboard inputs.
Some people fear that urandom could be not-so-random if taken from a VM or a USB booted Tails for instance. (Due to the way that urandom gathers randomness)
To combat this, there's actually an argument parameter in the CLI version of Electrum to seed with your own randomness (type gibberish for a few minutes or so, etc)
Bitaddress would be better if they supported BIP39 and showing the first addresses of the BIP44 path etc.

The only solution to your problem is to ensure marginal fees are always zero.
Then the question becomes how do we stop (or classify?) spam?
With zero fees, opponents of bitcoin will spam zero fee transactions forever.
With a low constant fee, no matter how low you make it someone is mad ("it costs 4 cents to send 10 cents!!!!!zomg!!")
With a value relative fee, spammers can turn 1 transaction sending 100BTC into millions of transactions sending a total of 100BTC. Increasing utxo set and clogging the network, dropping low spec nodes like flies.
With a byte size relative fee (current), it is not intuitive to users. They don't understand that having 10 utxos to spend costs more than only 1 utxo. Also "paying x to send y dollars can make no guarantees since user fees will vary greatly" (I have never paid $4 to send $10, even with fee rates over 300 satoshis/byte and prices over $3000/BTC)
So really, the only solution to your problem is something that creates many more problems.
Of course, this all assumes on-chain scaling only.
This is why I am certain that mainstream adoption can only happen via Lightning Network and Sidechains.

You underestimate fear and utter rejection of SI units, even for people living in countries that use them.
Most non-science people memorize "a millimeter" and what that means and "a centimeter" and what that means, "a meter" and what that means. And they will have their own internal rulers for each unit individually, so when buying furniture, they will see millimeters, and compare to the millimeters of their current furniture and have a good measure...
But the second you say to them "this sofa is 0.002542 kilometers long"
I GUARANTEE you that a large portion of the population will say "uhhhhhhhh how long is that in millimeters, again?"
Sure, you could say "oh, just divide by one million!" (which you will know is just sliding the decimal point over 6 places) but anyone bad a maths will look at you and say... "umm.... so how many millimeters again?"
rebranding to "bits" and getting rid of the "coin" imagery is the best thing we could possibly do to remove some of the biggest misconceptions and psychological barriers to bitcoin existing today.

That requires twice the capital though, so the capital required to amount held off market ratio is lower.
Say 1 BTC = 1 USD
I have 2 BTC and also 4 USD. Total value is 6 BTC.
If I pay with 2 BTC and buy back 2 BTC, I end up with 2 BTC and 2 USD and Overstock keeps 1 BTC off market.
Total BTC off market: 3
Total capital tied into BTC: 50%
If I pay with fiat and buy the same amount to buy BTC I end up with 4 BTC and 0 USD and overstock keeps nothing off the market.
Total BTC off market: 4
Total capital tied into BTC: 100%
Using the same logic, the best selection is to not buy anything on Overstock and just put all your money in BTC.
Total BTC off market: 6
Total capital tied into BTC: 100%
The idea of the buyback is to keep the same amount of BTC holdings while at the same time using BTC and proving BTC can be used as payment.
Since this use case usually has the amount of BTC held off the market be the same before and after, having Overstock keep half off the market is an improvement of the original purpose of the buyback model.

the gap limit is a local setting in the config file that sits right next to your wallet file.
You can either: open it in a text editor and say "gap_limit":100, or you can type a special command in the console of the GUI or a command (electrum setconfig gap_limit 100...... I think)
Again, reading the source would help to figure this out.
If the config file doesn't have a gap_limit key you can just add one and it should import that as the main setting.
Just be warned that adding a huge gap limit ahead of time will mean every time you have to restart the process it will take longer to query the server each time which is unneccessary, and just using addrequest function will add only the number of addresses actually necessary to the queue for querying.

Litecoin booms
Litecoin steals some market cap from Bitcoin

An equilibrium is found where Litcoin offsets some of the brunt of Bitcoin's scaling woes.
Since LN can be made atomic, LTC and BTC hybrid channels increase liquidity between the two.

If there are two chains with the same consensus rules and one chain has more proof of work, it is the main chain. If someone were to release software that blacklists the first block after the fork of the longest proof of work chain, you would need to upgrade your software in order to stay on the shorter chain.

1. raspberry Pi will crash a lot unless you give it a HUGE SD card and a few gigs of swap disk space (remember to configure it to allocate the swap disk on every reboot) Because 1 GB of RAM will not cut it.
2. I recommend running bitcore (nodejs bindings added on top of Bitcoin Core) instead of Bitcoin Core directly. The reasons why are that running bitcore allows you to connect directly to a Copay wallet or Trezor (myTrezor) wallet. This gives you the convenience of SPV smartphone wallet, but the "don't trust anyone" goodness of a full node.
3. If you want encryption and authentication, make sure your home internet is a static IP. Check with your ISP to make sure that is so. Then on your home router, forward port 443 to your node's machine.
4. Install Apache or nginx on the box, purchase a cheap domain and point " "www" and "bws" subdomains to your home IP.
5. Install and set up Let's Encrypt' certbot  free SSL and it auto-configures for most server software (like Apache)
6. Now, just use your server software to reverse proxy any requests to  to  (this is the default port BWS listens to for hosting Copay's backend)
7. On Copay, when creating a wallet, click advanced and type in your bws url.
etc. etc.
For Trezor's MyTrezor site, you also need to forward /insight-api/ as well as /socket-io/ or something like that to port 3001 (default for insight-api service on bitcore)
bitcore is very good with releasing new updates via npm to keep up with bitcoin core official releases, but if you don't want to trust them, you can add their nodejs bindings to the bitcoin core source manually and compile yourself if you'd like.

This is outdated information.
The "request" feature was added rather recently, and allows you to save "requests" in your wallet file for later use.
(In fact, it might be the case that the merchant script will create requests beyond the gap limit automatically, I'd have to check)
If you make a request and there is no unused address within the gap limit that doesn't already have a request, it will return an error unless you pass it an argument that says "yes, you can ignore the gap limit" which will let you generate addresses indefinitely.
By the way, you can also change the gap limit in the console fyi, which is another way to get around it.

In Japan, we will be at parity with "bits" when USD $10,000/BTC (ish, depending on USD/JPY rate) right now, a loaf of good quality bread that costs 500 yen will cost 4706 bits. close to 10x our currency, but still manageable to think about and look at.
In Korea, they are currently at 1,131,000 won per BTC, meaning they are a tiny bit over parity with bits. A loaf of some good quality bread that costs 5,000 won will cost 4,421 bits.
In fact, I can't say much for Korea, but breadwallet is probably THE most popular wallet in Japan among Japanese users. Not because it uses bits, but It goes to show that bits is not a big hurdle over here.

Nah, even if 1MB limit, hitting it once does not increase fee pressure.
Bcash needs to have consistent &gt;1MB blocks with no breaks, THEN you get to say "hey look, we're doing better."
For all you know, mining consistent 5MB blocks triggers some obscure bug that wipes out the entire network requiring some sort of emergency hard fork rolling back and setting a lower block limit.
You don't know because no one cares to use Bcash.
If you guys care about your own blockchain, why not spam your own blockchain for a change and prove that you can handle consistent 2MB blocks / 3MB blocks / 4MB blocks etc.
Currently, even 0.1 satoshi/byte transactions are being gobbled up, so holding a 5 MB blocksize only needs 0.005 BCC in fees to spam. $3.
Someone do it. Then brag about it, please.
Heck, collude with miners and get some of your money back.
Better to do it now when no one is using it and prove your point rather than bragging about how you theoretically might scale better in the short term.

I think LTC will implement segwit and LN first, and LTC will gain traction against bitcoin.
Miners seeing their profits fly away will scamper to support segwit to save their profits and bitcoin will either remain the leader of the pack if they do so quickly enough, or people will slowly move into LTC as it becomes accepted as the micropayment standard of the internet with browser integrations.
If LTC passes segwit first I guarantee LN will start testing with LTC (seeing as support for alts is nearly as simple as support for testnet) to get some incentive for hackers to hack it as compared to testnet which has no value.

Your question implies that there are only two choices:

2. Manage a file on a storage medium.
Have you never used a wallet that generates a 12 (or 24) word "recovery phrase" for you?
Those wallets make it easy to just write down a 12 word phrase on a piece of paper, store it in a safe place, like where you keep your tax records or something, and now you have an eternal backup. No need to worry about cloud this and that. Those 12 words are all the data you will ever need to restore your wallet forever.
Managing a wallet.dat file backup for personal use is something people did in 2013, not 2017.
You are free to do whatever you want, though. I'm just shocked because it seems you have missed out on the last 3 years of wallet innovation.

Please buy a Trezor. You can use it with Electrum, Copay, Multibit HD, and also MyTrezor (Trezor's webwallet) has gotten MUCH better in recent months.
The greatest piece of mind is that the device runs all the signing for you, so that your private keys NEVER TOUCH AN INSECURE DEVICE.
Seriously... you could go the 100% free route and set up a cold storage with Electrum on an airgapped Tails OS install and only keep watch-only keys on the Electrum on your online device.
I did that for years, and there were some close calls... and I would consider myself technical.

1. Their apps are open source, and they use multisig, so you both need to agree in order to send bitcoins. This can be seen as good, as if you personally get hacked, then 100% of the trust is not with you (or someone who hacks you, or greenaddress) either.
2. Since their apps are all open source and include open source tools for fund recovery, you would just download one of those tools and recover your funds.
3. Greenaddress holds one of the keys, so no... you can not access your Greenaddress wallet from any wallet outside of Greenaddress.
If you want to use single signature wallets, a lot of them are inter-compatible, but most multi-sig wallets are not, because they rely on sharing keys with the site itself to mitigate risk on your end.

This is partially to blame BIP39 authors, and partially to blame BIP32 authors.
However, I don't really blame BIP32 authors, as they just wanted to get the derivation function down, and people jumped on it like a deer in a pack of lions immediately implementing 5 million ways of doing it, and most wallets then switched to BIP44 afterwards, causing user confusion because some users of old versions were restoring to new versions and getting empty wallets etc.
Since BIP39 has no way to encode the used path, the only way to fix this is to try every path that has ever been implemented ever... a headache to say the least.
BIP39 needs a redo imo. Electrum's current mnemonic format is better than BIP39, but still needs work imo.

@_date: 2017-01-02 12:05:30


a what?


Bitcoin wallets don't store bitcoins, they store the keys that are needed to move the bitcoins associated with those keys on the blockchain.
There are two keys in a key pair, a private key and a public key. Guess which one is secret? (hint: the private one) The public key is used to generate an address which you send to people in order to allow them to send bitcoin to you.
Mycelium is open source, which means I can tell you, line by line, exactly what the app is doing on your phone with every button press. So unless they are masterfully good at hiding a purposefully engineered bug somewhere, they do not ever touch your private keys.
Every time you turn on the app, your app sends off a list of all your previous addresses as well as a few extra, just in case you've given them out and are awaiting funds on them.
Mycelium's server has its own copy of the blockchain, and they tell you "hey, I saw these transactions that pertain to your addresses you sent me" and your app looks at all the transactions, tallies up how much you received and sent, and shows your balance.
If the servers are attacked, they CLAIM they do not keep logs (but their server is NOT open source, so we don't know)... but IF THEY WERE keeping logs, a hacker could know which IP address asked their server for which addresses at what time... also they could be logging sent transactions too, like "We relayed a transaction from this IP address to send x bitcoins from a to b"
A hacker could then use other external information to invade your privacy. (Like if they knew your IP address etc.)
But Mycelium claims they do not log info, and I believe them.
And I know that their app never sends private keys to their servers, so I know they can not steal my bitcoins.

1. Single SHA256 is weak. Passwords should be hashed at least 10,000 times using pbkdf2 etc. if you must roll your own (not recommended) remember to concatenate the salt and password to the previous hash before hashing the next time.
2. How are the private keys generated? If not connected, then you need to have db backups regularly. Ideally the keys should be generated from an HD private key. Backup is much easier then.
3. If you have a lot of money going through, I would suggest using a service like bitgo. They will countersign your transactions for you and reject certain criteria to prevent theft. They charge 0.1% on outgoing bitcoin transactions (not including to change addresses) but piece of mind is worth it.

The median (6th) value is 2017-08-01  02:38:56.
In actuality it is currently 2017-08-01  03:55:56. So the median blocktime is 1 hour and 17 minutes behind reality.
But in exchange for being a little behind reality, we can all agree on a time, and it is impossible for the median of the last 11 blocks to ever move backwards.

They made the wallet before BIP43 and BIP44 were even proposed.
Changing to add BIP44 serves only one use: Allow for wallet portability between other apps.
However, their stance is "we are the most secure mobile app..." so "oh, go ahead and just put the same phrase in every other app, forget about it, then get hacked and blame us" seems like a big minus side for them. Or at least that's their perspective on the matter: cross compatibility with other wallets is a security detriment.
They openly admit that had they started making the wallet after BIP44 was proposed, they probably would have used it... but at this point, adding it would only complicate support tickets, complicate user upgrade processes, and since they use SPV, will require a lengthy rescan for the new chain.
tl;dr they gain nothing but negatives from adding it now. If they noticed a huge exodus of users maybe they'd do it, but obviously they probably aren't. Not to mention a large portion of their user base is people who aren't very tech savvy to begin with. "Grandma needs good security too." I think is a paraphrase of something said at a talk Aaron Voisine gave once.

If all exchanges, payment processors, and mom&amp;pop stores are on the lightning network, then theoretically there could be a situation where no one closes.
Of course that is only in theory, and contingent on many unforseen factors which probably won't happen.
But there is no intrinsic factor in the protocol that requires you to close any or all channels. If everyone is on the LN, you can send and receive money on the LN. People like to call LN an IOU system, but since it is a 100% guarantee, I would consider money sent on LN to be more secure than an unconfirmed raw bitcoin transaction.

The point is Amazon restricting who can connect with it bears no meaning. They can't restrict who they transact with beyond 1 hop without also forcing their partners to restrict as well.
But then you are talking about a separate protocol that is isolated. A walled garden like AOL back before the open internet.
That is not "LN will be centralized" but "LN walled garden clones will be centralized"
Then you have to ask yourself "why did a free and open internet win over the walled gardens?" and "Why do I think the walled gardens will win this time?"

Copay + Priority fee settings = cruise control for cool.
Seriously, most of the time I could have waited a few blocks (for transactions that don't require me to wait for confirmations) and saved a few cents, but I'm not sending out like 500 transactions a day or anything, and tbh my time is worth much more than a few cents for the amount of time I would have to worry about whether my transaction confirmed or not.
Bonus, if I spend an unconfirmed utxo that has a low fee, paying too much by always using priority will most likely cover some of the fees for my input transactions via CPFP.
People like me are probably pumping up the bitcoin network fees, but hey. I'd rather not deal with it, and I'm not going to risk having to troubleshoot my transactions and waste my time just so some guy can save a few cents.

If all miners switched to a non-segwit client, they would cause a hardfork. Segwit funds safe on the original chain.
If all miners colluded to re-mine blocks all the way from before Segwit locked in, it would take them weeks to catch up and overtake the current longest proof of work... during which time, there is a huge incentive for someone to come in and pick up the slack on the main chain.
Not to mention such a reorg attack would be easily noticeable, and if it happened could easily be reversed by blacklisting the reorg's forking block unanimously (also hard fork)
No one would ever agree "oh, this chain that was mined specifically for the purpose of replaying segwit transactions and stealing them is totally the most valid blockchain." so a hard fork to remedy such an attack would not be controversial... except for the miners that profited from it and their sock puppets.
But by the time we have 100% of miners colluding on anything, it's already time to do POW algo change imo... but that's up for debate.

@_date: 2017-01-26 14:47:16


No they don't.
The bitcoins have to be placed in the channel in order to open the channel, but once it's open. As long as CheckSequenceVerify and SegWit are implemented, you can leave the channel open forever, and at any given time, both parties would be able to close the channel with 100% certainty at the current state without the other party's consent.
Closing the channel in an amicable fashion is slightly less expensive, data size speaking, and less of a wait... so if you can, try to not be or meet shitheads... but even if you do, the difference is only a few bytes and a short wait period, and you're guaranteed to get the bitcoin you deserve.
You can also open up channels where only one side contributes to opening. So let's say my friend opens up a channel, places 1 BTC in it and I place 0 in it. I can now use that channel to RECEIVE funds through my friend if I want, and if I have other channels that have balance on my side of the channel, my friend can now send THROUGH me, and maybe I'll waive all fees for him because we're pals.
It's up in the air how the network graph will spread out, but there is no requirement via some special rule to close the channel ever.

That confidence was misplaced.
Breadwallet warns you explicitly that the ONLY way to backup your phrase is by writing it down.
It is not breadwallet's fault they didn't list every possible backup app and say "you can not use A, B, C, D, ... Y, Z for backing up."
Unfortunately, breadwallet stores its data in the secure element, which is not accessable by any other app other than breadwallet, and on reset of device, the secure element (which resides in the CPU itself) is securely wiped, so no data can possibly be recovered.
If you do figure out how to restore your data through forensic inspection of the CPU die, then please report it to the manufacturer, as you would have basically found a huge vulnerability.

Ignoring them means that people who don't buy in ignore and people who do buy in all buy in.
Warning about the scam will mean that people who don't buy in won't, and a portion of those who would have bought in will realize the scam and quit, and another portion will see it as people trying to make money by manipulating them and using that as impetus to buy more.
Warning will also get the word out about it, so if the warning is sent to a large population of gullible tinfoil hatter, yes, ignoring it would be better, but if it is just gullible people who listen to reason, then it could do some good.

They can not differentiate between an LN transaction and a normal on-chain multisig transaction. So they can't "charge more" for LN transactions.
LN users have no incentive to pay higher fees than is necessary.
but tl;dr you're barking up the wrong tree. Bitcoin's fee market is in no way sophisticated at all, so asking "what will happen to fees when abc?" is like asking what is the next dank meme that will take the internet by storm... anyone can make a guess and no one can support with hard data...

The 15 word phrase was merely an encoding of your login password hash.
When you would login, they would hash your password and use that password to let you into your account... but if you use the 15 word recovery phrase it would just decode the password hash, and compare that data itself to your password hash to let you in.
Either way, that 15 word password will do nothing if you can't log in to blockchain.info's old wallet.
The only thing you can do is send a ticket to blockchain.info's support and tell them your information. (do not send them your 15 word phrase though... they probably won't ask you for it, but they might give you a special link to use to log in to the old wallet service.)

1. LastPass has a great security model, where even though they were hacked, no passwords were compromised, and there was no way to associate an email address with the password hash in the table, so directed attacks were also nearly impossible without also phishing a specific target. Their "change your master password" advice was merely for the sake of being ULTRA cautious. Not to say that getting your DB hacked is a good thing or should be OK, but I'm just saying that people play up their hack waaaay too much, when it wasn't really a big deal security-wise.

The blockchain has always worked this way.
Before segwit, nodes could TECHNICALLY prune individual transactions ENTIRELY if all the outputs were spent (since the point of syncing the blockchain (to people who already have synced) is just to maintain the utxo set and make sure everyone is holding the same utxo set.)
In this state, a node would hold merkleblocks with all the transactions that still had utxos in them, but any block where all outputs of that block were spent would only be a blockheader, a coinbase transaction, and all the branch hashes to confirm the coinbase transaction is inside the merkle root.
If all nodes did this extreme pruning, bitcoin would be dead.
In the same exact way, (the way in which this "extreme pruning" is easier or harder to perform in no way affects its efficacy) segwit witness data can be completely deleted, preventing new syncing users from verifying witness data during sync and putting just as much trust in the proof of work under the assumption that "miners wouldn't have been able to pass this block off to the entire network if the miners were properly validating and all the non-mining nodes were keeping the miner honest."
Acting as if Segwit adds a new vulnerability that didn't exist before is dishonest. This "vulnerability" is akin to saying "well, couldn't all nodes just throw away all blocks before 400000 and no one could ever sync from 0 again?"
Yes. They could have before segwit, and they can do the same exact thing but using a different method that is unique to segwit.


Running a full node will, by default, download, verify, and store all witness data on your disk.
@_date: 2017-01-19 07:58:17
This thread shows one way, but you would be relying on Electrum servers to do your validation for you (though you will be using SPV proofs to check validity) Electrum will work with an xpub exported from Copay just as fine as one exported from Electrum, so don't worry.
The other route would be Bitcore + Bitcore Wallet Service + a script daemon using Bitcore Wallet Client to manage funds and generating addresses (the main library used in Copay)
Electrum would be easier, imo.

That is incorrect.
When I say re-route, I mean send money through the network.
           Bob
      ____/   \_____
      |             |
    Alice         Charles
So in your example, "I" am Alice, "someone has sent money to me" is Bob, and "I now want to send money to someone else" is Charles. Notice I have not drawn a line from Alice to Charles.
The Lightning Network "Network" part refers to the ability to send payments THROUGH other people. So if I send 1 BTC to Bob and Bob sends 1 BTC to Charles on my behalf using the channel they already have, there is no need for me to open a channel with Charles directly as long as my channel and their channel has enough funds in them to support the transaction.
When I say re-route, I am imagining a much more complicated network where there might be 20 different paths to Charles passing through 5-6 people each, most of which I don't even know exist. Those people will likely charge me a small fee to route through them, but since I will know all the fees before I send, I can choose the route with the lowest fee.
If LN fees end up being higher than just sending a bitcoin transaction to close one channel and open another, then LN has failed in my opinion... so most of the time, unless you plan on frequently trading with that person AND you are sure they are well connected (many channels with many other people) sending over the network using existing channels is cheaper and less hassle.
This all makes some assumptions about a robust network... so actual reality near the beginning might be different though, who knows.

Good catch. I was counting on ViaBTC not noticing that fact, but oh well...
I wonder what would happen if someone actually spent it as an anyone-can-pay, then it confirmed pre-segwit activation.
a post-segwit node that was syncing from genesis would only validate segwit rules after the signalling blocks are parsed, so it would probably be fine...
I'm sure a lot of third party block explorers' segwit transaction parsing logic would choke on it. (since it has no witness) Unless they were able to properly code in the cut off.

Channel operators = everyone.
There is no way to participate in the lightning network without a channel.
Also, you're hand waving a lot of steps between "umm, I think operators pay more fees (because... reasons?) and settle them on the blockchain... so fees are massive. (what? lol)"
We are ALL settling EVERY transaction on the blockchain right now. Lightning Network will only REDUCE the number of transactions on the blockchain, not INCREASE the number.
If the number of lightning settlement transactions is 1000 per day, then there are potentially 1,000,000,000 transactions behind every single settlement transaction that NO LONGER NEEDS to be on the blockchain.
So by definition, Lightning Network only REDUCES fee pressure.

coinb.in is meant to be mostly a manual process.
it does all the lookups, signing, and transaction serialization for you, but you have to worry about which inputs to remove or how much to send.
Once you look up the balance, afaik there is a X button to remove inputs from the transaction, then you can add an output and send to another address you control and send the remainder. total input value minus total output value equals your fee.

Yes you can.
Now there's a provable receipt of who I voted for... so someone with tons of money could offer me money to vote for someone, or my boss could fire me if I don't tell him my public key and vote for xyz.
There are reasons why anonymous ballots are used, why voting is done in a special place with oversight from bi-partisan agents.
Rigging the election as it is currently would require much more work than a blockchain election, as currently, there are as many independent elections being held as there are counties in all the states.
You would need to rig most or all of these individual elections to try to sway the results. Huge manpower sink.
Blockchain could be combined with yet-invented crypto to provide a good base on which to develop a backend for voting booth software, but that opens a new vector for rigging the voting software if every county uses the same software.
tl;dr saying "put it on the blockchain" is not an end all solution to everything.

Your new Trezor becomes exactly the same as your old Trezor.
Every Trezor is exactly the same as far as the chips and boards inside (hardware) but the only differentiating factor is the 12 (or 24) word phrase that is stored inside it. That is your wallet.
That phrase in and of itself... is your wallet.
If I stole your phrase and had 0 access to any Trezor at all, I could still steal every single bitcoin you own.
The Trezor just lets you USE your bitcoin without letting any malware ridden computer even KNOW your phrase.
tl;dr, your phrase is the wallet, Trezor is merely a machine that lets you spend from your wallet securely without getting hacked.

It makes 2of2 multisig wallets like greenaddress able to provide their "instant transactions" without requiring the user to save some tool as a backup plan or something.
Simplifies the process a ton, so greenaddress and anyone trying to do similar services can leverage this to provide better service to their users.
In fact, the whole transaction emailing tool using thingy with greenaddress was one of the reasons why I never was too fond of the whole instant transaction 2of2 thing, but if they use CSV, stores accept their "instant transactions," and blocks fill up again like the other day, it could be a godsend imo.

Usually with a transaction like this, with two outputs, one is a very round number and one is a very strange obtuse non-round number...
the round number is the sent amount and the non-round number is change.

If they did it with Trezor or Ledger, the change address was automatically verified by the secure element.

The main contingency that other person adds is "when you need to open another channel"
You said "when you need to pay someone"
Those are two very different things.
By definition at least one of the two parties needs free roaming bitcoin to OPEN a channel...
but if you are PAYING someone, you can route your payment through EXISTING channels and as long as you have a few well connected nodes in your channels with lots of liquidity available, you would never need to use a direct bitcoin transfer, but rather just send it on LN and be done with it.

ECIES allows you to perform symmetric encryption on data using a shared key between the two private key holders.
However, most libraries just generate an ephemeral key to use for the key exchange, and encode the public key of that ephemeral key into the "encrypted data."
So technically, the process is:
1. Multiply the ephemeral private key with the recipient's public key to generate a new point. Hash this point to get a symmetric encryption key.
2. Encrypt the data using the symmetric key. (note: you are not using the public key to encrypt)
3. Securely delete the ephemeral private key from memory, and encode the ephemeral public key along with the encrypted data.
4. send the data to the recipient.
Then the recipient does:
1. multiply your private key with the ephemeral public key encoded in the data. Hash the resulting point to get the same symmetric key as the sender.
2. Use the symmetric key to decrypt the message.
To technically, you are not "encrypt(ing) a text message with a btc public address" but you are encrypting a text message using a symmetric key generated by the diffie hellman key exchange between two key pairs.

Yes. Using a single signature wallet with compressed keys (any wallet with a 12 word phrase backup method uses compressed keys) will lower the size of a single input from 297 bytes to 148 bytes, basically saving you half the fees for each input used.
Since inputs are on average 70-80% of the total transaction, and in cases where there are more than 5 inputs, inputs make up more than 95% of the transaction size, so loosing half of that means about 35-45% savings on your fees depending on how many inputs you use.
Also good to note that if SegWit passes eventually, input size will have a much much smaller impact on the total size of the transaction, and since more transactions can fit in a block with SegWit, the fee market should become cheaper.
Hoping SegWit is passed soon, this is getting kind of ridiculous.

whois the domain, find the registrar, impersonate the police and attempt to social engineer some dumb employee to leak info, use that info to find other places to social engineer / give ideas for phishing attacks directed at OP / whatever.
By knowing that he has a lot of bitcoins, there is a huge incentive to try any means to get close to him and know more about him so they can hack and/or ransom him in some way.
That's what is meant by saying "you are painting a target on your back"
But realistically, back then it was feasibly impossible to give out individual addresses to donors without some slick coding and regular backups.
I don't believe Electrum was out yet, so the idea of deterministically generating addresses without need of private keys wasn't a thing back then. So blaming OP is a moot point.
Though if it was me, I would try to brush things under the rug a little and switch to a newer address, not make a big deal about it, and hope that none of my donors were major hackers.

This is impossible without being tied to some sort of full node implementation or using an external API to gather utxo info.
To create a signed tx, you would need the following inputs:
1. All utxo txids for the address
2. All utxo indices for the above txids
3. All amounts of the utxos above
4. The private key for the address used in 1
5. The address you wish to send to.
6. The rate of fee you wish to include into the transaction.
1,2,3 would require getting utxo info from somewhere.
6 would require getting accurate fee market info from somewhere.
4,5 are the easy part.
You can use bitcoinJ, but I personally like bitcore-lib (node JS) for writing and signing transactions.
If you just want a tool to do everything for you (I believe it gets 1,2,3 from some outside API, but you need to worry about change (and therefore, fees) on your own (some people have sent transactions with 100 BTC fees because they forgot to add change output to the transaction.) you can use

Nothing. The exact same addresses, the exact same transaction history, and the exact same future addresses will show up. You could even technically use both at the same time and they will (most likely, unless some of them have look-forward bugs for balance discovery) both work fine.
The only problem is the Trezor effectively has 0 purpose anymore. Because the whole point of the Trezor is to say "my phrase has never touched any piece of technology at all besides the Trezor, so therefore I can not be hacked." If your phrase is already on blockchain.info, you could get hacked phished or any other combination of bad things and have your phrase stolen from your account right underneath you, or blockchain.info's database might be hacked and someone grabs your guid and password somehow (from a previous hack you were compromised in or something) and happens to decrypt your phrase etc...
If you use Trezor, generate a new phrase on the Trezor and use that. Recovery on a non-Trezor (or non Hardware Wallet at least) device should only be done in a super emergency, like, you KNOW that someone stole your Trezor AND knows your PIN and you NEED to sweep all the funds out before they can get to a computer etc.
Other than that, just feel safe in the fact that the phrase can be used with most hardware wallets to recover everything in case of an emergency.

The alternative being you keep your Bitcoin on Coinbase and "You never have control of your bitcoin, even when you want to sell it." (There have been times where users were prevented from selling the bitcoin on their Coinbase account because of reasons that no one is ever told.)
Also, if bitcoin deposits are frozen, their trading platform is most likely frozen too.
Also, if you're selling as a knee jerk reaction to the price starting to fall, you're a bad trader.
Also, if you're selling at all you're a bad hodler.
Therefore, Buy, get off the exchange, wait until you strategically want to sell, start the deposit process a few hours to a day before you plan to sell, just in case, and sell your coins, then withdraw to your bank account ASAP. The same goes for buying bitcoin. Send from bank, buy bitcoin, withdraw bitcoin ASAP.
Anything else is antithetical to what Bitcoin stands for.

1. You don't generate new ones. Electrum will generate new ones every time one is used. Try sending coin to one address and you will notice listaddresses has 21 now. It tries to keep 20 unused addresses at all times. If you need to keep track, use the addrequest command through the shell

For receiving bitcoin, the ONLY thing your phone needs to do is show the receiving address. As long as you have your recovery phrase, your phone could explode right after you copied the address and it wouldn't change a thing.
If you are having trouble seeing your balance on some wallet software, try refreshing or resyncing somehow (depends on the software).
The only land mine I could see someone stepping on is if you THOUGHT you were sending to wallet x but in actuality you accidentally opened wallet y when retrieving your address.
Try looking again, or wait til you can charge your phone and check that same app again.

So let's say all people willing to sell their bitcoins agree to keep the price at 1M$ per BTC.
Remember, the fact that they are selling their BTC means THEY WANT TO SELL.
If there are thousands of people waiting to sell at 1M$, then if you sold at $999,999 that would mean the thousands of buyers would buy your bitcoins first.
Which means everyone who wants to sell needs to undercut everyone else and bite their lip, selling at a lower price.
The same goes for buyers.
Let's say buyers all decide to keep BTC price at $1 = 1 BTC...
if all buyers are lined up at the $1 line, and you want to buy RIGHT NOW... you need to offer $2 for your bid to buy the BTC in order to cut in line.
So there are buyers who sit there with their bids sitting well below the current price... and sellers who sit there with asks sitting way above the current price... then there are the impatient "takers" who buy and sell the asks and bids that are sitting around the current price point.
When all the asks at $700 are bought up and all that remains is asks that are $701 or more... then the people throwing bids (trying to buy) will raise their bids by one dollar each to try and beat the other buyers.
The same goes both ways.

Bank accounts in Japan are free, but are so heavily regulated that it is very difficult to open one unless you have a specific reason. (ie. a letter from a company saying you need a bank account to receive your salary etc.)
Then when you actually try to send money from one account to another account, it usually costs about 400 yen per transaction (about $4 USD) and debit cards are hard to come by, usually run by non-bank entities (which means they're more like pre-paid credit cards), charge fees, and to top it all off... almost no one in Japan accepts cards of any kind anyways.
In Japan, cash is king, crime is low, so many people walk around with anywhere around $500-$2000 USD in their wallet in cash.
Now, there are IC card based "Electric Money" cards that work similar to NFC and allow you to charge them with money and use that money at a lot of stores and almost all train stations for fares. However, this model charges all the fees to the merchant (similar to credit cards, but cheaper), which is why most stores that aren't huge chains don't accept them.
Being someone who has bank accounts in the US and Japan, and constantly is moving funds from one to another... and I have a stock of bitcoin on hand. My biggest usage has been international money transfer.
Every now and again I take half of what I want to send and try to send via Western Union or SWIFT or some other "cheap" remittance app... every single time, the money that took the bitcoin route gives me more money in the target account, which is why I continue using it.
Not to mention that a handful of restaurants I love in Tokyo accept bitcoin, and one of them offers a 10% discount for bitcoin use (The owner is a huge bitcoin enthusiast)
To me, the $0.09 is not a big deal.
I understand it's not pretty to show off anymore, but tbh the bitcoin network was NEVER free, so if you tried to send $1 and immediately send $1 back, the network would take forever to confirm it. Of course you could sweep it under the rug back then, but now that free transactions are no longer a thing, there's no more rug to sweep the bad parts of bitcoin under.
But hey, I like to stay optimistic. I see many scenarios where lightning network helps bitcoin become the 100% free payment rail we all dream of. (Imagine payment hubs as being ISP-like entities that open channels with user devices that will pay all the fees for your day-to-day transactions and make that money back by feeding you ads on your browser or something)

1. Not just breadwallet. ANY wallet can steal your bitcoins eventually if you are not careful. Trezor / other HW wallets have update mechanisms which most people will just click update and confirm on the device whatever pops up. breadwallet users will just tap update even if breadwallet's Apple Dev account was hacked by an inside job at Apple etc. Final word, EVERY WALLET HAS SOME AMOUNT OF TRUST INVOLVED. The only way to completely eliminate trust is to be versed in the programming languages of every app and piece of firmware as well as be able to disassemble, verify and produce your own hardware parts down to the silicon level.
2. Which is why apps like Copay and Electrum which allow multisig wallets with multiple HW and/or software based devices. Have one key on your phone, one key on your Trezor, and one key on your Ledger. Two out of SatoshiLabs, Ledger, and your phone manufacturer would need to be compromised, AND they would need to know your wallet used their hardware, AND they would need to work together to steal your bitcoins.
BUT, you'd still be trusting Copay or Electrum's software to use the correct sending address. (though this is mostly avoided if you confirm the address on the HW screen)
Truth be told, the most tinfoil hatty ways also have theoretical attack vectors if CPU manufacturers have been planting tiny wireless devices that transmit private keys to the NSA immediately.
So tl;dr everything requires trust... heck, I have to trust my central bank won't destroy the money in my pocket and prevent me from withdrawing more from my bank account... so I'll take my chances with the breadwallet devs, thank you very much :-P

Since this is ELI5, I'll try to make an analogy:
Imagine you only have one court in the whole world, and this courtroom has only one judge that can only work 8 hours a day.
Obviously this judge can only see a certain number of cases per day, and if the number of cases that need seeing are more than that for a given day. They have to wait for the following day.
Now imagine that the defendants of the cases could pay an optional fee that the defendant decides. Obviously the court would order cases by order of most fees per time required to hear the case (a $5 fee to hear a 10 minute case is the same as a $10 fee to hear a 20 minute case, etc.).
Some people think: "Make more courts! Hire more judges!"
But the people against that say "well, we are using this court to basically notarize every single contract we all make... so why not just make private contracts between two individuals and only bring it to the court when there is a dispute or wrongdoing?"
Not to mention that adding more people suddenly is not as simple as just hiring some guy off the street. It takes a lot of time and training, and vetting.
So for now, everyone has this court notarizing every single contract they make, and everyone has to pay fees out their butts... but eventually people will be able to optimize the process, and then we can think about how many courts or judges we need and how to go about increasing them.

If you are using a newer wallet (a blockchain.info wallet that was newly created within the last few months) you can just take the 12 word backup phrase and use that to "restore wallet" on Mycelium and it will import all your blockchain.info private keys into Mycelium for you (no fees).
However, if you're paranoid and think bc.i could have sniffed your private keys somehow (their client side source code is open source, and last time I checked they can't) then I would recommend just creating a new wallet on the wallet app you want to use and send your whole balance to that new wallet.

wouldn't it make more sense to have these things running in an environment where you can choose LN or on chain?
Would you rather we wait until a full node costs $500 a month to run and/or a transaction costs $50 to send on-chain before even thinking about LN?
If Bitcoin were a cell phone, this is why I think we should be building energy efficient chipsets (optimizing layer 2 solutions and block relay etc) rather than just slapping on a 2x large battery and making the cell phone harder to carry around.
Sure, 2x right now wouldn't hurt us that much, but it would set a precedent similar to how Ethereum set a hard fork bananza precedent with their controversial TheDAO refund.
We would get into a habit of hard forking whenever any group of people gets upset. Then what's to stop the government to pay off members of the community to say "hey let's add permanent inflation" or "hey let's add KYC to the protocol layer"
I think blocksize increase proposals that are soft forks are better imo, because laying a precendent for mutability in what was promised to be an immutable ledger is dangerous.

You are using Bitgo, which is a 2 of 3 multisig wallet. even with 5 inputs and two outputs, you're looking at about 1563 bytes.
with 80 satoshi/byte fee rate, that would be about $1.14 @ $915perBTC (0.0012504 BTC)
The extra money to get up to $2 can be explained by perhaps BitGo's fees?? (BitGo takes a fee on every transaction, unlike other wallets.)
Or you had more than 5 inputs for some reason? (change optimization, etc?)
BitGo's fee calculation algorithms are all closed source, so I can't tell you... but yeah according to my calculator you would need to include about 9 inputs to get a "best fee" of $2.

That's not the risk here. The risk is that someone can literally tell the carrier to stop sending SMS to your SIM card and send it to THEIR new SIM card instead.
So in your example, you might not notice that your phone is no longer getting any reception (especially if you're at home on Wi-Fi) and suddenly they'll try to hack you and the SMS will be routed to your Google Voice, then forwarded to your number which is now on a SIM card the hacker controls, and you never even noticed.

Telegram's SMS doesn't send to Google Voice at all. (I tried it) It used to work, but not anymore.
Also, there are ways to hack a Google account even with 2FA using advanced phishing techniques, and all it takes is one brain fart to compromise all sites you have under Google voice.

I added a request that is more general [here]( which would make things easier for anyone who wants to use a specific exchange's rates.
Currently Copay uses Bitpay's fee API, which is primarily based off of USD. So the price of USD/BTC is calculated, then the price of USD/KRW is multiplied by that to get the approximate KRW/BTC rate...
However, as you have noticed (and I have notice in Japan as well) that the markets in other countries are not always the same as the USD/BTC market... and both of our countries are slightly more expensive than USD.
Please +1 the issue if you believe it should be added. If my issue is included, you could add Korbit as your price with the following.

That website calculates the fee based on the assumption that every mined block will give themselves 12.5 BTC + fees.
However, the bitcoin rules state that the miners can not create more than 12.5 BTC in new bitcoins... no check for less.
A block gave the miner 6.25 BTC and collected no fees (no transactions besides the mining reward transaction)
It was mined by `BTC.com` and they threw away 6.25 BTC (the could have given themselves 12.5 but only generated 6.25)
So the website you link did something like:
    total fees = miner reward - 12.5 BTC
And unexpectedly, miner reward for one block was 6.25 which meant the "total fees" of the block was calculated as -6.25......
Edit: This is the block that threw away over $42,000

The second you attempt to recover it on an online device, it could be pwned faster than you could manually recover it.
So if you do plan on emergency recovery, I would recommend always carrying around a laptop, a USB with TailsOS, another USB for data transfer. That way you could download the ciphertext, load it on the USB, boot into Tails, load the ciphertext in and shut down Wifi / internet, sign your transactions, get the signed transactions on your USB, then log back in to your normal PC and broadcast the transactions.
Make sure the two USBs are never able to be physically tampered with. Same with the laptop.

I could run my super awesome gaming rig for 2 weeks straight mining and only make a cent or two.
Your macbook will not make you any money, and you will basically costing whoever is paying your electricity bill $100 in electricity for every cent you earn in bitcoin. And it will take a reeeeeeeally long time to make that first cent.
If you want to receive regular payments steadily, you will need to invest probably at least $3000-4000 in some special bitcoin mining machines that suck up tons of electricity, BUT the electricity cost to bitcoin return ratio is MUCH better.
So they might eat up $10 in electricity costs in the first month, but earn you $12 or so.
If you want to make serious dough in mining:
1. Find a place where electricity is dirt cheap.
2. Buy a large piece of land there.
3. Build a warehouse (or skip 2 and rent a large already built warehouse)
4. Invest a few million dollars in rows and rows and rows of mining equipment.
5. Set it all up without burning your warehouse down (requires electrical knowledge and computer knowledge)
6. monitor them 24/7 so you can fix machines that break / reboot machines that freeze etc.

Copay has gotten pretty usable.
Single user wallets are completely compatible with other wallets like Mycelium that use BIP 32, 39, 44.
For multisig, each signer only needs to know their 12 word phrase, and there are a plethora of ways to back it up; if you don't mind relying on the server you created the wallet on a little bit, then all you need is (ex. 2-of-3) 2 people knowing their seeds. The server will tell you the pubkeys of the 3rd person.
If you want to back up in a way where Copay's server could explode some day and you'd still be fine; you need at least one member to make an encrypted data backup of the wallet (that will contain everyone's pubkey data) and maybe make a backup of the source code of Copay and the server (both open source) so you could recover on your own copay and your own brand new server.
They also have email notifications and push notifications for iOS and Android.
Copying a copay wallet from one copay to another is as easy as scanning a QR code etc etc.
I've really come to love this app.

Think of a blockchain as acting like a court with a judge.
Right now, every user of bitcoin has to set up an appointment with the judge, fill out the paper work, and if the court is backed up, they must wait for a long time (or pay off the judge to get them to see your case first)
Lightning Network will be like an iron clad contract that you got the best lawyers in the world to write for you.
If the other party breaches that contract, the offended party could just take the contract and the proof that it was broken to the judge and the judge will always decide in the favor of the offended party.
Lightning Network doesn't need hashrate of it's own, it relies on the bitcoin blockchain's hashrate as a deterrent to fraud. If you try to defraud me, I can broadcast a transaction that will steal ALL YOUR MONEY, so you have an incentive to NOT defraud me, and the same goes for me.

Because if there are 500 routes I could take to pay Bob, and if 499 of those LN operators collude to charge $0.25 per transaction, I would make a SHIT TON of money by charging $0.24 and running my own LN node.
With miner fees, there is only one collective block size supply, whereas with LN the "route supply" is as large as people want to create LN nodes. Pushing fees towards 0, then LN nodes drop like flies allowing people to charge more fees, allowing more people to start up LN nodes. The equilibrium will be found at the marginal cost plus a small percentage divided by the average throughput of transaction volume on thr network. (Hint: running a full node (and lightning node) with small blocks costs less, thus pushing these fees down further)
Economics ftw.

Did you use m/0' like you're supposed to, or did you leave the default m/44'/0'/0'
Copay uses BIP44 and Bread uses some weird path logic that was given as a hypothetical in BIP32 documentation.
First key of BIP44 is m/44'/0'/0'/0/0
First key of Bread is m/0'/0/0
Electrum takes whatever you type in the restore screen before the password (default is m/44'/0'/0') and adds /0/0 to get the first key, /0/1 to get the second etc...
So try using m/0' instead of the default. You can manually overwrite the text you don't need to click the buttons they give you.

Bitcoin Core: Source code seen by thousands of smart devs, cool. Now time to make an executable program out of it. Everyone makes theirs independently, everyone makes the exact same byte for byte executable, and can verify with signatures and hashes that this has nothing extra added in.
Electrum: thousands of people looking at the source code on github is great... BUT if 10 people around the world try to turn it into an exe or dmg file for execution on your computer, everyone will get a different binary... so there is no way to verify the "official" download actually is compiled from the "official" source... so the only way to be 100% sure it isn't a virus is to build the executable yourself.
However, Thomas is a trustworthy person, and he signs each official release... so if you verify his signature you at least can verify the executable is the exact one Thomas made and there is no virus as long as Thomas hasn't put a virus in there.

That's called arbitrage, and there are tons of people who make money off of doing that.
If there is a gap between exchange prices that stays, it means there is a problem of cash flow somewhere. For example, Mt. Gox was much higher than all other exchanges before it went under, because bank transfers were not getting processed, so everyone bought Bitcoin so they could withdraw the bitcoin (easier) which caused the price to go up only for them (no one wanted to arbitrage with them for risk of losing money)

Because it doesn't generate BIP39 phrases. The creator of Electrum made the first phrase based backup mechanism for Electrum &lt;=v1.x.x and then the Trezor guys, Satoshilabs, came along and said "hey it would be great to do something similar for Trezor!" and BRD lead dev also showed up. Basically, there was a lot of disagreement going on, Satoshilabs was probably eager to get Trezor out the door to start making some money, and the creator of Electrum basically said "ok you can go with your current idea but take my name off of BIP39" which they did. His name is no longer on it, and Electrum &gt;=v2.x.x uses the same word list as BIP39 BUT the seed derivation is completely different.
Not to rag on satoshilabs or anything, but I wish they would have delayed the Trezor and work on a compromise. "The father of phrase based backups" basically saying "I had nothing to do with this" is kind of a bad look... but 99.999999% of Bitcoiners today weren't there at the time anyways, nor were most of them lurking / paying attention to BIP discussions etc.
But it will let you restore a BIP39 phrase from another wallet and even asks you what the path you want to use is.

If Core just said "fuck it" and pushed out the next version of Core with a 2MB block limit, no timing or limits, just immediate deployment, no one would run it in fear of being "the one to split Bitcoin in half"
Then the debate of "no YOU do it first!" "no YOU do it first!" will go back and forth until some miner just shoves out a 2MB block and the price of bitcoin tanks due to Hard fork. "Bitcoin Zero" springs up running the old 1MB fork, a few exchanges start trading old fork and new fork coins.
Huge shit show.
So to prevent this, Everyone (not just blockstream or people with commit access to bitcoin/bitcoin) is saying "let's figure out a way to hard fork safely so Bitcoin doesn't die like Ethereum did."

Wallet fees are for sending. Those fees are paid to the bitcoin miners. Not Bitpay or GDAX.
When GDAX sent you 1000 bits, GDAX paid 185 bits to the miners in order to send you 1000 bits.
When you send back to somewhere, you will need to pay around 203 bits ish to send them all back (so you can only send back 797 bits ish.)
In Bitpay app, there should be a "Send all" or "Send max amount" button / link somewhere on the send screen. It will calculate the proper fee for that moment and subtract it from your total.
Edit: also, please note that fees are based on data size of the transaction, so if you were sending 10000 bitcoins (not bits) it would still be about 203 bits to send... Currently bitcoin is not too friendly to micro-transactions yet.

1. Yes
2. No
3. The pubkey associated with the private key derived by the hash of a number from 0 to infinity (edit: for BIP32, the limit is 31 bits, so technically a few billion). So using index key 0, you would end up with PubkeyZ being the first pubkey in your wallet, then 1 would be the second, 2 is the third. etc. Since I know you will generate your indices (which will each result in different addresses) in order, I can generate addresses for you just by knowing your master public key.
4. Math-wise, yes. But in practice, xpub style master pubkeys contain other info for use in deriving the index keys.

Yes, whereas the 12 word phrase used in most modern wallets (including the new blockchain.info) is called BIP39 and is actually the private key to the wallet itself, meaning you can take the 12 word phrase to any wallet and have it generate all your private keys and addresses independently without relying on a server.
The 15 word phrase is basically a copy of a hash that exists on blockchain.info's database and used to let you in when you forget your password.
@_date: 2016-12-27 07:26:31
The elliptic curve sum of two public keys is a new different public key.
The sum of the private keys associated with those two public keys add up to the private key of that new different public key.
So if I know your master public key, and I create a new public key by hashing a number (counting up from 0 to infinity) and using that as the private key, then calculating the public key, I can calculate the new public key by adding your master public key with the index public key.
However, only you can calculate the new private key, because only you know the master private key.

Welcome to stage 1 of Bitcoin-itis, it looks like you contracted the disease from investor's intrigue.
This method of contraction usually starts with closely watching the 1 minute candles and becoming irritated when it's not all green all the time. The cure to stage 1 is watching a 1 minute candle drop down to half and wipe out your savings.
If you can survive stage 1 without selling, you will move on to stage 2 Bitcoin-itis, where you try to tell all your friends and family about how great the technology is, and how there are millions of alternative currencies and how the world will become a better place. The cure to this stage is family members thinking you're being scammed and trying to save you from yourself and do crazy shit like take your wallet and not give it back to you until you promise not to buy any more bitcoin.
Then you move to stage 3. stage 3 is different for many people...  you either:
1. Start a company and get 70 million dollars in seed funding to solve global problems in third world country using "blockchain" (but really you just want to use bitcoin)
2. Start programming apps and contributing code to open source libraries, and telling all your programming friends how you contribute to bitcoin after getting a spelling fix merged.
3. Forget about bitcoin, accidentally throw away your hard drive, and one day realize it was worth millions. (Harder now, as most wallets have 12 word backups that are easy to write down and keep safe)
Stage 4... ultimate Satoshi oneness with the cryptoverse.
Have fun!

ThomasV was the one who inspired BIP32 and BIP39.
While he approves of BIP32, he asked for his name to be removed from BIP39 authors list because he disagreed with the spec, and was off-put by Trezor devs rushing it and ocilifying it in their hardware so future versions and backwards compatibility would be impossible, causing every wallet to be required to stay on the less than perfect BIP39 standard as-is forever.
The current implementation of mnemonics in Electrum is ThomasV's vision of what BIP39 should have been. (And is incompatible, but uses the same wordlist.)

1. Those extra steps are not really adding security. Just complexity. There's a difference.
2. You assume USB memory is safe from fire and flood?... you haven't addressed this.
3. Encryption is easily broken with a $5 monkey wrench. (You will talk when they break your knee caps) So the only way to protect your coins is to make it so even you can't access them easily.
4. You want to leave your bitcoin to someone in the event of your death? Well, your current idea doesn't account for that.
A simple way to do it:
1. Set up your Trezor with the optional passphrase enabled.
2. Write down the Trezor phrase on 3 pieces of paper.
3. First, deposit 0.01 BTC on the first address of the wallet you get when you enter no password for the passphrase.
4. Then, deposit the rest of your BTC on the first address of the wallet you get when you enter a simple password that only you and the person you want to have your BTC when you die would know.
5. Store one copy of the phrase in a fireproof safe along with other valuables.
6. Store one copy of the phrase in a separate place. Safe deposit box etc.
7. Store the last copy in your wallet.
If a copy is stolen and the person knows what it is, they will see the  0.01 BTC and steal it. That's the canary in the coal mine. If that happens, move all your BTC to a new phrase.
I also made an app that encodes your phrase into a paragraph, and the positions of the words are based on the hash of a password... so entering the paragraph and your password, the app can decode your phrase.
But I lost the app, so I stopped using the paragraph thing. (luckily I had my phrase written in other places and methods)
If you make a super complicated method of storing your phrase, you WILL eventually forget how it works and the "how it works" part will become part of the secret... Then you'll be out of luck.

Are you 100% certain that the address you think is in your breadwallet is actually YOUR address?
Where did you find the address in the first place? Breadwallet doesn't show old addresses?
If you copied it from your transaction history, maybe you accidentally pasted an address that you SENT TO a long time ago (maybe a Bitpay merchant address etc)
Also, another possibility is that you have a virus that replaces the Bitcoin address you entered with a bitcoin address of an attacker at the last second.
Look through your old transaction history receiving transactions. Then on the "send to" part look at addresses that say "Mine" and see if you can find the address somewhere.

If I showed the private key and address. I would be making another tool that would encourage using brainwallets.
This tool is to encourage people TO GET OUT of brainwallets. (at least, the brainwallet.org/bitaddress/etc. kind)
You can look at the source, it generates your private key, then the address, then looks up the address balance on insight, generates a transaction with all the funds and sends it to the address you input into the second box.
Since the idea is to get all your funds out and never look back, I am starting to think adding offline functionality is too much work for little benefit.
Unless you have like 1,000,000 BTC or something... in which case I am in awe that someone would trust a single SHA256 brainwallet with that much money... but then I could understand if they don't want to risk the chance of some hacker constantly monitoring some keylogger on their system or something like that.

That's true for any centralized service.

One of the core parts of any security system is the ability to revoke / replace secret keys that are compromised before they are actually stolen.
However, if someone developed a tech to mimic your voice / Face / Fingerprint perfectly (aka 100% match measured by any machine) you can't just replace your voice, face, or fingerprint.
Most security experts say "biometric data is great for a user ID but bad for a password."
3FA (2FA etc) are basically extra passwords, so biometrics would not be a good idea for anything you want to keep secure.

Bitcoin total supply at Jan 1, 2015 ~ 13.6 million
Now, ~ 14.5 million
We're not even done with the year yet and that's a ~6.6% increase in money supply.
Sure, it's better to have a known increase than an unknown secret money supply (I think 2% is a bullshit number Re: USD inflation rate) and investors can count on it, so the inflation doesn't really work the same way fiat inflation does...
But all that being said, we have a very openly 9-10% YoY inflation rate that will only go below 2% in 2021 (ish)

Because the wallet is poorly maintained.
Two major instances:
1. When they released an update that would basically make the wallet pick a new private key from a pool of 256 keys instead of a pool of 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,936 keys. And this not only affected newly generated addresses, but also signatures. Signatures became so weak that they leaked the private keys of previously strong addresses. (Because blockchain.info encourages address reuse, it also exacerbated the problem)
2. They were using a website called random.org to get randomness to add to their key generation. (This was a reaction to problem number 1) When they set this up, they did 2 things: 1. They used http instead of https, so the random numbers were sent to you in the clear where anyone snooping could read. 2. They disabled a feature called re-directing... After a while, random.org disabled random number generating over http and required everyone to access over SSL encrypted https. Once random.org stopped supporting http, they sent a RE-DIRECT to the device, but the wallet app had disabled redirects for some reason, so they would use the message "THIS IS A REDIRECT YOU DUMMY" in place of the random numbers, because the redirect message itself is the only data they would receive. This, in addition to an Android bug that somehow disabled the other source of randomness, caused EVERY PRIVATE KEY generated in the Android app to be the same exact key. Some people deposited funds only to have it immediately withdrawn by someone else... chaos.
number 1 was bad enough, but number 2 took the cake.
Also if you're a developer, just look at their git repos and you can tell they don't know how to manage a development project, let alone multiple projects.
But everytime I point this out to people, a slew of downvotes comes... soooo I guess it's not true at all. You can just ignore me then.

Very true. But as my disclaimer states, this is a tool of last resort to *get out* of brainwallets without encouraging their use (by not showing the private key or address)
This was made for the event (which I hope happens soon) where all implementations of single SHA256 brainwallets are abolished from the internet (sans wayback machine/github histories) and normal joes with bitcoins in "some phrase from a book that no one bothered to check, but someone could easily dictionary attack." as their brainwallet can use the tool to rescue their bitcoins and stop using bad security practices.
The idea is to never turn back, so the security of that phrase, after exiting, should not be of concern to the user.
However, anyone using a password they use for other services, or have dug themselves into a hole and are using that brainwallet for some sort of outward facing product, should definitely NOT use this tool.
I hope my warning and disclaimer are clear.

As long as that 128 bits of entropy ends up in a psuedo random key with a keyspace of 256 bits, then yes.
The extra 128 bits of security will only help if your adversary is a person that doesn't know what they're doing... But even in that case, you are decreasing the likelyhood of a potential crack by almost nothing.
However, if someone is brute forcing a private key, we would assume they know what they are doing, and therefore the security (a rough estimate of the number of guesses required to crack) of secp256k1 is the size, in bits, of the keyspace (256) divided by 2.

My point was to discourage brainwallet usage.
Any tool that gives the user a WIF private key is enabling them to use brainwallets.
My tool is meant to be the last resort way out when all sites have removed their brainwallet functions, and single SHA256 brainwallets have gone the way of walkman casette tape players. However, I did not want to **enable** the behavior of using them, so no private keys. The only thing coming out of my site is a transaction removing all funds and sending to the address you paste into box 2.

Even using MD5 for TOTP wouldn’t be that bad.
The device never exposes the full hash and merely converts a portion of it into a 6 digit number, which blurs the possibility space significantly.
Plus, even if someone got a hold of one of the full hashes on your device without also getting a hold of your secret, you would need to find the preimage... not a collision (Google’s attack) which is far easier.
tl;dr SHA1 is sufficient for TOTP

You would have to code your own app, but if you could stomach that, why not just generate unsigned transactions, and sign them as a normal message using the bitcoin message signing protocol (aka not a valid transaction signature)
Then have your app send these unsigned (but signed in an non-standard way) transactions, and check if the message signature matches the pubkey of the outpoints referenced in the input. If it does, then display the balance.
Then if your kids "cash out" then they send the transaction back to you (actually just delete it from their device) and your device gets a notification.
That way their app can independently verify that the intent to pay is there, but any normal wallet will still view the bitcoins as being in your wallet the whole time.
It sounds like a pita to code, but might be a fun side project.
I recommend coding it with nodejs with a library like bitcore or bitcoinjs-lib, then packaging it with cordova.

Try a wallet out and keep your addresses private (aka don't tell anyone about them) and you can delete the wallet fine. I do it all the time.
However, if you have given someone an address, it is best to hold on to the private key (or master seed or whatever it came from) because some people are dumb and will send recurring payments to the same address.
You can help fix this by never sending to an address twice. Every time you want to send bitcoin to someone, get a new address from them. (This is best practice, and some wallets are better than others at doing this)

Copay. 
You can either:
1. Create a Personal Wallet (1 key, 1 signature) then export the backup, and import that same backup on your other device. The addresses will never be the same, but you can see that depositing into one will show up on both. (Copay derives addresses in a fashion that copying the same wallet to different devices will generate different addresses, but they all know of each other)
2. Or, you could make a 2 of 2 multi-sig wallet with your Mac and Android. This will require confirming the send on both devices before the bitcoins actually move.
2 will have extra security, but also extra hassle to backup (both keys will need to be backed up, so backup once on Mac and once on Android. However 1 will only require 1 backup (the one you import into the second device will suffice)
BTW, copay is an open source project which does not do KYC AML, so gambling is ok. They don't monitor your transactions, and if you want you can create your own server to use with Copay. By default, Copay uses a server run by Bitpay, similar to how Mycelium uses a server, except Bitpay's server is all open source, and Mycelium's is closed source.

The best way is to make a p2sh based multisig wallet.


Yes, just as "Apples" should not be confused with "Fruits."
A p2sh can be an m of n, or not. An m of n can be a p2sh, or not.
It's like two overlapping circles making a venn-diagram.
Some great ways to make multisig wallets:
 (Super easy, but not cold)
 (Use this to generate offline keys to use with coinkite's multisig service. (Their multisig service is free) This can be cold if you run it offline)
 (Use this to generate offline keys to use with the transaction tabs etc. ( lets you generate the keys for use in the multisig))
To be honest, unless you are planning on holding tons of BTC AND know what you're doing, I would just stick with copay for multi-sig. Heck, there are other sites and services that do security escrow for you (protect one of your keys for you and enforce limits etc) like

6. brainwallet.org realized that its existence was contributing to a problem. Shuts down.
I think all brainwallet based sites should shut down, and generate a special tool that will ONLY sweep them. aka it will NOT show you the address, it will only check the address balance in the background and immediately send it to an address you set.

They are not your coins...
What could happen to COINBASE'S coins? They could lose them. They could pretend they lost them. They could say that you sold them when you didn't. They could lock your account and prevent you from withdrawing any coins, forcing you to buy a lawyer and sue them to get anything done. They could call your workplace and tell them you are dealing in bitcoins and get you fired on accident.
They could do a lot of things.
Will they?
Who knows. Many people would say "probably not" but a lot of these cases are "rare cases" meaning only a small percent of accounts will get frozen for suspicion of shady activity... but Coinbase doesn't reveal what their definition of "suspicious" is...
Withdraw 0.01 BTC every 24 hours on the dot? Maybe they view that as STRUCTURING WITHDRAWALS FOR MONEY LAUNDERING PURPOSES!!!! ACCOUNT FROZEN.
Ate eggs for breakfast? ACCOUNT LAUNDERING MONKEY FECAL MATTER REASON!!!! ACCOUNT FROZEN.
tl;dr 99% of the time, nothing will happen. Just pray you're not an unlucky person.
Now, of course, there's the other side of the coin... what could happen to your coins if you receive coins from the good graces of Coinbase's withdraw system??? You could lose your coins, destroy your coins. Bake your coins in a pie... whatever you want to do with them.
Not your keys, not your bitcoin. Please learn how to manage keys, manage wallet apps and software using small amounts BEFORE you dive in.

That’s the whole point.
Right now bitcoin has a 2 hour grace period for block timestamps, which means a block can have a timestamp LESS THAN (earlier than) the previous block and bitcoin as a system is fine with that.
So let’s say I want to ramp up the difficulty with your new rules in place, and I have a large amount of the hash power. I just constantly try to make my block timestamps as late as I can possibly make them compared to the last block that isn’t mine.
You would have to sample blocks of different intervals to get a larger picture of where difficulty is heading. Just saying “subtract timestamp of last block and second to last block and subtract ten minutes” means that you need to trust individual miners to not screw it up for everyone else.

The goal of http is not utterly destroyed by sniffed packets, the analogy makes no sense.
Using your analogy and extending it to something akin to RBF: if the network sniffer developers paid off all the network admins in the early internet to implement a protocol to allow users of their network sniffers to immediately capture packets heading to any specified IP address and allow them to capture and modify those packets BEFORE they are sent to their destination with a simple UI with a few buttons.
So if you're pro-full-RBF, then GreenAddress should abolish your "Instant Confirmation" API completely. I mean, that's not efficient for miners and requires merchants to trust you guys and if it's not in a block we should nuke all possibilities of it being worth anything.
Nah, nvm that would be a bad idea... full-RBF would force droves of people to your service BECAUSE of your trusted "Instant Confirmations".
In fact, one with enough tinfoil on their hats might think that this notion is what is dictating your stance on this issue.
Fortunately such tinfoil is not on my hat, so I think no such thing.
But yeah, if we're going on the "Wouldn't you rather just destroy all honor-system based work arounds in Bitcoin and create real solutions? Fix 0day stuff instead of suing and stuff?" Then the only logical next step is to turn off the Instant Confirmation function on your service... because that's exactly what you're doing.

When people say this, they mean the following:
1. Only receive once because if you don't, the two or more people who you sent your address to can glean private information from your transaction history.
2. Only send once because when you send bitcoin, the EC public key is exposed to the blockchain. And while it is still pretty safe to use, in the (insanely unlikely as it may be) event that the cryptography supporting Bitcoin breaks down, the first addresses to break and get stolen from will be the ones that have their EC public keys published to the blockchain. Plus, sending twice means you most likely received twice, so discouraging both receiving and sending twice is often the community motto.
tl;dr: only use address once **each**. Receive once and Send once.

Blockstream didn't even come up with Lightning Network, though.
Blockstream is just like the Linux foundation, it's basically a group of developers that come together to try and solve some of the major problems facing a certain project. They are funded by philanthropists and also people who want to start the RedHat of Bitcoin. (ie. Consultant / support services for users + support directly to enterprise customers using a custom interface)
Blockstream is not looking to generate a revenue stream by running lightning networks and getting a cut of those fees.
It just so happens that everyone in Blockstream were originally of the camp of "ok, Bitcoin doesn't scale. How to we solve this?" long before the blocksize debate, and so they started a solution, Sidechains. They had been working on sidechains for a long time, then along came two guys to the San Francisco Meetup to discuss a possible solution to scaling. (Great minds think alike, I guess)
Currently, since blockstream is currently funding development to further the Bitcoin protocol, they took the LN under their wing and told the two original guys "we'll give you a mailing list and fund development as well as give you one of our guys to work with."
Then, all of a sudden, the blocksize debate happened, drama happened, and people who don't follow dev mailing lists religiously or know anything about the open source community and who's doing what (aka 99.9999% of just see:
1. Company
2. Funding "them" (because anything besides blocksize increase is "them")
3. Therefore must be motivated by money.
Let me say something first, to get it out of the way.
Human beings need money to live.
I dedicate my time to Bitcoin projects for free (for the most part) in part because I love the community and also in part because I love learning more about it, and the quickest way for me to learn is hands-on.
However, this is because my life has me in a position where I can comfortably maintain a work-life(-bitcoin) balance that keeps me happy and healthy.
If no one was paying the blockstream guys, I'm sure ALL of them would still contribute to solving bitcoins problems... BUT it would take years instead of months.
These guys are seriously working their asses off (and getting paid, yeah) for the betterment of Bitcoin as a whole. They turned Sidechains from a whitepaper into a working alpha in a few months. Not only that, but they built a load of amazing new tools that put Ethereum to shame (sorry for the jab, I respect them too) and for that my head will never rise for them.
If I were some sort of sock-puppet organization trying to destroy Bitcoin somehow, the first thing I would go for is to make the public despise anyone who is funded and working toward Bitcoin's betterment. This way it would make investors scared to invest in development projects and it will slow down development until another plan could be enacted.
Now, this is not to say I think this is what is going on here... but I do feel like a lot of people on don't know much about Open Source funding, its history, the obligations / non-obligations for each company, etc. and just think "they get money = they are enemy"
My thanks to the members at Blockstream, and I hope you guys are not discouraged from your great work.
To everyone who has been hating on blockstream, let us remember that there is no one button solution to anything and we must tackle these problems with working minds, not emotional ones.
Thanks for your time.

That has nothing to do with what you said: 


0day : rbf :: suing researcher and ignore the bugs : Instant Confirmations
Instant Confirmations is literally the exact same thing as deciding as a group to just not relay double spends, except for one crucial point: GreenAddress has complete control over the system and so if full-RBF is adopted and all traffic, awaiting lightning's development, went through GreenAddress Instant Confirmations, then GreenAddress has more power than miners, as everyone will then sing praises of Bitcoin and say "ITS INSTANT!" and the only difference between now is that GreenAddress would have an "instant double spend" button at their disposal just by fooling a merchant that queried your API. 100% guaranteed to succeed.
The whole argument of "let's tear everything down unless it's 100% reliable right now" is irresponsible.
Even if you were to argue that "oh, well why don't other companies make their own GreenAddress-like services until lightning is done? That's not centralized, then is it?" you would still have a first mover's advantage, and you know that.
It disheartens me that GreenAddress is not one of the front-runners for the anti-RBF movement. That would make sense, as I thought you stood against 0conf double spends.
But it seems to me like you just want to exacerbate 0conf double spending.

Electrum doesn't work for recovering Trezor funds OUTSIDE of Trezor. Electrum can only recover Trezor funds WITH a Trezor device.
This means that Electrum can talk to the Trezor device, and new wallet creation / wallet recovery WITH A TREZOR can be performed on Electrum.
(As an aside, the version of Electrum with Tails is 1.9.8, which had a different seed mechanism (and different words) where if you inserted an invalid phrase (which any BIP39 would have been) it would read the text as hex data and use that as the seed... so it had nothing to do with your password, even if you used no password, Tails Electrum would not have generated the same addresses.)
If you would like to recover the Trezor seed WITHOUT a Trezor, you need two things.
1. A BIP32 / BIP39 / BIP44 compatible wallet.
2. A wallet that supports BIP39 passwords.
Currently the only wallets I know of that allow recovery of Trezor seed with password is Mycelium (Android and iPhone)
There might be others, but I have Mycelium just in case, so I don't really care too much. Someone else might have other recommendations.
Edit: oops forgot to plug my little tool.
This can be downloaded from the Github link at the bottom of the site, and run on an offline computer to generate individual private keys from any BIP39 phrase or BIP32 master key. In the "Paths" dropdown box, look for BIP44 Receiving addresses and Change addresses to find your Trezor addresses.

Pushing it today will not gain any profits for anyone, so the only people who will implement it are people "making a point" about something.

Not complaining. Just stating that the purpose of Bitcoin is to prevent double spends. That's the WHOLE PURPOSE. Sure, it is not ensured without POW behind it (in a block), but then of course the goal of http was to serve web pages as they were intended.
Adding RBF is akin to adding a simple Windows program for a small fee where you can choose anyone's computer on the whole internet, spy on their web surfing and click one button to instantly modify any web pages they try to view en route to their computer.
Sure, right now a hacker / coder with a little skill in bitcoin programming could code an app to attempt a double spend with a certain amount of probability. RBF would make double spending unconfirmed as easy as a click of a button, and guaranteed to confirm over the first spend.
So, normal Bitcoin: Only hackers can double spend some times.
Recent Bitcoin (lots of non-important consensus differences that can be gamed): Script kiddies can double spend some times.
(all nodes) RBF Bitcoin: Anyone can double spend with the press of a button with 100% certainty.
@_date: 2015-07-19 13:19:22
Let's say I get an extra 0.02 BTC per block I find for implementing RBF. (This is an insanely high estimate, just to make a point)
If I had 49% of the mining power, that's 1/2 the blocks, so approximately 72 blocks per day. 72 blocks per day x $5.80 is about $417.60 per day in extra fees at current price!!! HOLY MOLY!!!
But wait a sec... doesn't that go to the miners? Oh yeah.
So, let's see how much 0.02 BTC compares to 25 BTC. That's 0.08%, so almost a tenth of a percent.
So look at it from the perspective of each miner.
    Benefits: + 0.08% revenue increase
    Risks: Price going down maybe? (Only needs to be a 0.08% decrease really)
Now let's look at the costs involved:
    Costs incurred by pools: Man hours for developer to implement RBF into their pool operations while it is running.
    ROI: Pool fee % multiplied by the $400 per day. Then use that to divide the costs above.
So even with an outrageous estimate of how much extra revenue the pools could make, it is nowhere near enough to say "ok, we can make ROI in a reasonable time, and make more profits!" and some people in the higher ups of pool companies will definitely say something like "umm, but does RBF really need to be done now? What if price goes down?" and you've got a gridlock in the company preventing full RBF.
So like I said, the only pools implementing it are either pools who want to see Bitcoin burn (aka economically illogical people, as they are earning income in the currency) or people who want to make a point (a la certain people who shall remain unnamed)
I understand your point is "well, they COULD do this and we would have no way of stopping them!" and you're totally right, there are illogical people who do these things for reasons not dictated by money or gains. However, supporting full RBF serves no purpose right now. Only to be a "warning sign" that will have lasting effects on people's perceptions of Bitcoin as a whole.
No one is saying to stick fingers in our ears and sing lalala all day long. We are saying "ok guys, let's try to slow down double spenders artificially while we create other methods to mitigate the risks"
Saying "let's destroy Bitcoin and leave it in shambles until someone finds it in their heart to fix Bitcoin. Maybe we can pay them in Bitcoin." and then acting surprised when no one wants to save it anymore won't fly imo.

Most of these wallets work on libraries.
These libraries are built on crypto libraries which have signing functions used as-is.
Almost none of the higher level libraries give access to fine grained control of the signature process (What you are saying is to generate the hash digest of the data to sign and return only the r and s values...
I could code something like that, and I'm sure you could too... however, most wallets being built on outward facing open source libraries means your use case will never be built into a popular wallet... or at least I don't think so. (I would like to see it in Bitcore Wallet Client / Copay, but it's a niche use case)
Copay is currently working on BIP39 integration etc... so once Copay gets that in there backups will become a lot easier imo.

2. 1 conf is 97% secure
3. 2 conf is 99.91%

Great, then why can't they unilaterally push their big block agenda through?
If everyone with two brain cells or more abandoned Core and the idiots left decided to make a stupid hard forking change, I would guarantee you people would either not upgrade or move on to another implementation.
I believe that if keeping 1 MB limit required a hard forking change (aka status quo was some sort of ever-increasing limit) that Core would not get support for that either.
Bitcoin as a network resists change. Core is not actively stopping big blocks, it just seems that way because "status quo" is extremely strong in Bitcoin.

I don't even need a "private IP". Just a node on the network or 2-3 public facing transaction push APIs.
You are assuming that the attacker is some omnipotent god that knows every possible way I could connect to the internet. And also that they have somehow figured out a way to block and takedown every single public transaction push API, as well as bitcoin node that is associated with me.
300 bytes could be printed on a paper airplane and thrown to my friend. We're not dealing with gigabyte sized transactions, here.
Oh, and the reward for denying all those IPs for days straight without giving me enough leway to send 300 bytes over the course of (let's even assume something to your favor) 24 hours.
They were able to reverse a 0.001 cent transaction. How am I ever going to make ends meet!!!???

Whenever I see a "durr breadwallet implicitly supports BU, Samourai supports Core! Everyone switch!" I realize how this whole blocksize debate turned into what it is now:
A bunch of people who don't understand the technical specifics of Bitcoin rallying behind someone who overtly plays to their emotional convictions.
If Samourai came out with some BIP proposal to allow SPV wallets to detect hard forks in a decentralized manner, and their "Motivation" section said they supported Core and wanted to allow their users to, that would be commendable.
Going on social media and making statements that will obviously mislead non-technical users into thinking their wallets will follow Core is not a good idea.
I am glad breadwallet didn't cave into pressure and make promises they can't possibly keep due to the nature of SPV.

Basically, once you've set it up, any RPC calls you make to localhost:8332 (which is default for bitcoin-cli), ssh with capture those packets, encrypt them, log into your remote server as the user you chose, decrypt the packets and then send those packets as the user on the server to the IP:PORT specified (in my example, 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and 8332)
So you have an encrypted communications line to your server's localhost:8332 but your bitcoin-cli (or whatever program you wrote) thinks it's just talking to your local machine's localhost:8332
This is great, because it means you don't need to open your server's RPC port up to the internet, and you can keep it restricted to localhost, but still access it from over the internet.

It's basically doing exactly what the LN was planning to do if CSV and Segwit wouldn't go through. But since it looks like both of those are, LN development decided to aim for the final realization of the extended channel model after their implementation.

Sort of.
You would need their public key (not address) and then use ECIES to encrypt/decrypt.
ECIES is more of a hack, kind of. It uses ECDSA to produce a shared encryption key, so the person encrypting the information could possibly retain information that can be used to decrypt the message. (Which is acceptable, as the encrypter could just make the message public either way)
So practically, yes. But mathematically, no.

With support for BIP70 pretty darn through the roof, I'd recommend the following:
1. Generate QR code with bitcoin URI that only shows the r attribute with a link to the BIP70 request URL. (also make it clickable with the same URI as the link so desktop wallets can read it)
2. Below the QR have a button "QR not working? Click here."
3. Assuming the QR works, if the response from the wallet does NOT contain a refund address, deny the payment by responding to the wallet with a denial of payment. They will then see the "QR not working? Click here." and click the link.
4. Assuming the QR works AND their wallet sends a refund address in the response. You're good to go. The wallet will watch the address for possible refund transactions.
5. Now for the "QR not working? Click here." link. It will clear the QR code, and give you a text input box to paste in a refund address, along with "please input refund address here in case of need for refund." If they enter a valid bitcoin address, THEN show them the QR code with a bitcoin URI using the address and amount referrers in the URI. (as a clickable QR code)
The only time this doesn't really work is brick-and-mortar POS... but I think you can figure out how to limit this schema to e-commerce only.

I don't understand you.
Sweep = send all the funds on a paper wallet etc. to one of the addresses in the currently open wallet. = You must back up the seed phrase of the currently open wallet otherwise you will lose your bitcoin.
Import = create a new wallet file that only contains 1 or more individual private keys (Electrum no longer uses hybrid wallets (having a seed phrase AND imported individual private keys) so if you have any imported keys you can't have a seed, if you have a seed you can not import (only sweep) = As long as you still have the paper wallet, the wallet file is not that important to backup.
If you plan on sending the whole balance you should use sweep.
Most wallets have a sweep function, so I would use the sweep function in your wallet of choice.

It does not require trust.
Basically, the recipient generates a secret and hashes it. Sends the hash to the sender.
The sender makes a contract stating "these funds will only be available if the redeemer can present data that will hash into this (and sign etc etc)" and sends the money to B. B can not redeem these funds without C's help, and by virtue of asking for C's help, C knows B is trying to redeem money from someone C is waiting on money from, so C gets the HTLC, the chain is now protected by the Lightning Network game theory based algorithm, so C can just send the secret to all parties involved and no one has to close their channel. Since they all know the secret now, those sends can be re-organized between parties into the normal sends and receives of the channel.

XT won't just create a hardfork out of thin air, they will create a version that, if it gets consensus over most miners, will then hardfork.
And tbh, if a small portion of nodes decides, after 90% of the mining power has moved on to XT, to keep running an old node then it won't really affect the network that much.
Bitpay, Coinbase, etc. payment processors will follow the 90% of the mining power, I guarantee it.

If you have more money than you could stomach losing in bitcoin, I highly recommend learning about the many different ways of storing bitcoin. Test each one out with small amounts and see which ones you are most comfortable with.
If your attitude is "I just want to do one thing and then forget about having to deal with it" then there are a plethora of ways to store your bitcoin securely.
Just ALWAYS TEST FIRST.
Just curious, have you tested actually withdrawing from your electrum wallet???
If you haven't, make a new wallet, buy a small amount and PRETEND it's your big wallet, then try actually sending it somewhere as if you were sending your huge wad somewhere.
If I had a nickel for every time I've had to calm down someone who panicked because they never withdrew before and were scared for their life about screwing it up, I'd be a millionaire.
Practice the whole routine, deposit, hodl, withdraw, repeat... Over and over until you are a master at all aspects of your method.

I'm not a gambler.
If you want to sit and moan about how you could have made so much more money if you didn't buy a game and rather held on to the bitcoin ...
You must realize you could say the same for anything.
"I shouldn't have bought a game and instead invested in the ETH ICO..."
"I shouldn't have bought that car in the 1970s and instead invested in Apple stock."
"I shouldn't have bought those socks yesterday and invested in Amway products, my friend is rich because of that!!!"
tl;dr treat Bitcoin like any other currency and it's easy to spend, because you're not a gambler. treat Bitcoin like a stock or a bar of gold, and obviously you're not going to spend it.
I use it for both... my hodl coins and my spending coins. Whenever I buy bitcoin I split it up between my two wallets, it lets me put more of my money into bitcoin. If I didn't spend any bitcoin, I would buy less bitcoin because then I'd need more spending cash.

1. set your server up so you can ssh into your server and run RPC commands locally `bitcoin-cli getinfo` etc.
2. On your local machine, download bitcoin-cli binary and save it to a path on your global PATH env. Make sure the permissions are set to 755 so you can run it.
3. On your local machine, run the following in a terminal: `ssh -i /path/to/your/ssh_key.pem -f &lt;USER&gt; -L 8332:127.0.0.1:8332 -N` (or leave out the -i &lt;key&gt; part if you use password based ssh.
4. Make ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf file with rpcuser and rpcpassword same as your conf file on your server.
5. Now just run `bitcoin-cli getinfo` on your local machine.
Now everytime you boot up your local machine, you should run `ssh -i /path/to/your/ssh_key.pem -f &lt;USER&gt; -L 8332:127.0.0.1:8332 -N` to re-start the tunnel on boot.

Samurai Wallet is SPV. Your wallet has no way to verify whether you are following BU or BC.
breadwallet admits this fact and makes no promises that it knows you have to trust on face value.
An SPV wallet provider that says "oh, we totally promise to only send you block headers from XXXX chain, we double pinky swear" is undermining the whole idea of trustlessness by effectively saying "trust us, your SPV wallet will follow Core."
Also note: I don't think that Samurai has actually promised anywhere that their SPV wallet will follow the Core chain, did they? If they did or didn't, then your blind trust in them is bad, and you should feel bad.
Bottom line: Run Bitcoin Core itself, or else you may end up blindly supporting BU or blindly trusting a dev making promises you can't verify.

In other words, a large portion of the demand for Bitcoin transactions would rather just give up on bitcoin rather than pay extra.
It is very logical to fear demand overcoming supply in a low elasticity market.
Now, if we can get tons of high elasticity demand (ie. Some bank using bitcoin for their internal systems.) then the fee event will be successful. However, all low elasticity demand will be priced out.

Transactions based off of a multisig wallet shared between the two parties in any given channel.
You can not (without giving custodial ownership to some central hub) have bitcoins in a Lightning channel without first sending your own personal bitcoins into a shared multisig and waiting for a confirmation. Then you can generate the commit transactions as well as all the subsequent punishment transactions branched off of that during the channel lifespan.
Since I have to send bitcoin from my single sig wallet to the multisig channel, i totally understand the "giftcard" analogy. Even though I can take my money back at any time, there is still a significant barrier to entry.
However, to change topic, I think the custodial model of Coinbase etc. will be interesting to see evolve around Lightning. I could definitely see Coinbase and Bitpay having a channel together and Coinbase can pay Bitpay payments with 0 fees.

This is not a vulnerability. The alternative was to have the user sign the message using the private key of the refund address to prove ownership.
Nope. If anything fishy comes of it, Bitpay has proof that you initiated the payment which caused the refund... you don't have "plausible deniability" here.

I personally think that due to these limitations, LN will truly shine in the custodial off chain wallet business.
If Bitpay and Coinbase only keep 10% in hot wallets, they might as well commit a portion of that to a direct channel with Bitpay, as a large number of users might have to send bitcoin to a bitpay payment address. Not to mention that fat channel will also be useful to LN for routing everyone else's payments.
LN will also be useful for colored coins. I could imagine the world's currencies all converted to some form of colored coin to be traded off chain with only the constant looming threat of blockchain arbitration to keep them honest.
However, LN for direct bitcoin transfer is a chicken and egg problem. We need TONS of channels with TONS of funds locked up in what are essentially hot wallets in order to make the network useful enough to merit adoption by Joe and his cups of coffee.

If reddit gold was 1 cent, AND I got 1 cent for every reddit gold I received, I would definitely gild a lot more.
"I don't spend money online unless shopping" is the old way of thinking when things need to cost more than $4 to make business sense.
If you made good posts and received 20 cents that can easily be spent on upvoting other posts and to withdraw that money would cost you 15 cents, you're probably more likely to leave that money on the site.
Now, if it were the Lightning Network it would be effectively free (besides routing fees which no one really knows how those will turn out yet) to "withdraw".
People have a hard time thinking about new paradigms. If you asked a person from the pre-smartphone era, they would tell you "oh, I would never go out without printing a map from mapquest first. I would never do that." Then 5 years later that same person uses car navs and smartphone GPS.

The exact same "concern" has been brought up many times before, and every single time someone takes the time to explain why that's not a big problem, basically the response is "but how would you know!?" (Because the situation has yet to occur.)
tl;dr the timer starts as soon as the old state transaction confirms, not as soon as the cheater broadcasts it. And if your transaction was high enough value, you could spend the confiscated funds minus the delta of your current state all to miner fees,  or if you are placing huge amounts in a channel and are super paranoid you could force both parties to send their unilateral closes to a 2 of 3 multisig with an arbitrator if you reeeeeally want to, or just make the lock in period longer.
It all depends on how many layers of security you want. The nice thing about LN is that you will be able to code logic into it that handles a lot of weird edge cases if you want.

100% of people buying anything with bitcoins are miners with remote uplinks to their pool operation server via google glass. Well noted.


So they would succeed 20% of the time you're saying... sounds dangerous, we shouldn't have people relying on 80% security, so we should make it 0% and add a line of code saying "allow block to be mined in place of a block if there is a higher overall fee in the coinbase transaction for miners to collect" it would be a hodge podge way of undermining the whole POW method, but why not? It's good for the network, right?
Given any random bitcoin transaction between a merchant and a customer, what percentage of those people are: 1. dishonest 2. miner pool operators 3. technical enough to find a way to increase probability of successful double spend. 4. lucky enough to flip the coin and actually get a successful double spend from an attempt
If you think these are all 100%, then seriously you're nuts.
The idea of "how about we give the user a 10 minute window to perform a chargeback with 100% certainty whenever they want?" is unnecessarily increasing a threat to the worst case scenario because "I don't want to be bothered to educate best practices to anyone, so let's just burn everything down so that it's obvious that 0-conf is absolute 0% reliable because we forced it to be that way."
Heck, even WITH RBF, I guarantee you merchants will either 1. continue using 0-conf and just have a higher fraud rate or 2. quit accepting bitcoin.
I highly doubt your warped vision of every merchant being like "durrr ok 6 confirms for everything regardless lololol" is ever going to happen.
@_date: 2016-02-17 16:16:23
malleated transactions only do two things:
1. confuse poorly written software
2. break chains of unconfirmed transactions
The reason why Lightning Network needs malleability fixes is because they rely heavily on creating "commitment transactions" that you hold on to and don't actually send out to the blockchain. If you can malleate those, then you could try to commit a malleated transaction and cheat the other party out of their money in your channel.
Malleability has nothing to do with Bitgo's model.
Bitgo's model is as follows:
1. Alice has a Bitgo account set up with their KRS option.
2. Bob is a merchant that accepts "Instant payments" through Bitgo (which is to say "Bob trusts Bitgo as a company", does not necessarily mean Bob uses Bitgo)
3. Alice has 10 BTC confirmed in the blockchain at her Bitgo multisig address. She clicks "buy shirt" on Bob's website.
4. Alice signs a transaction sending 0.05 BTC to Bob.
5. Bitgo signs the same transaction.
6. Bitgo broadcasts the fully signed transaction to the network, and Bob sees the unconfirmed transaction. Sends the shirt.
What happens if someone malleates the transaction?
The txid changes, whooopee. Bob still gets the money.
The reason why it's instant?
Because when Alice tells Bitgo "I want this to be an instant transaction" it means that Bitgo will not allow any transactions to reference the same inputs to be signed by their server at all. If Bob, as a merchant, "accepts Bitgo Instant payments" that means that he will look at a transaction and see if it's a Bitgo Instant Payment (through Bitgo's API, which, by the way, accounts for malleated txids because not everyone is dumb like mtgox) and if it is. He knows as long as he can trust Bitgo, there will never be a double spend.

How is it NOT an improvement for the buyer?
@_date: 2016-02-18 22:27:53
Again, not a problem.
1. Send 0.5 BTC immediately referring to the 0-conf transaction from Bitgo.
2. In the off chance that someone malleate's your transaction, make another identical transaction to 1, just referring to the new txid, and if the malleated transaction gets confirmed, broadcast the identical transaction.
Malleability causes a nuiscance, but does not break the usability or security of the model.
Bitgo does not guarantee the security when Bob sends off to the next person. They are only saying they cover Alice to Bob when using Instant Transactions.

Yes, that would help a ton. But the more urgent matter would be datacenters and home computer parts.
If I want to run an LN node from my home or on a VPS, I need to be sure that the private keys are never compromised while being online 24/7.
If the only time you had to use the device was when you're actually making a payment, this problem wouldn't be too bad, but for someone who not only wants to make payments, but also facilitate others' payments, this is a huge hurdle.
Phones will not be 24/7 LN nodes unless you want to kill your data plan and battery.
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:27:00
To be honest, though, if a payment hub closed 100 million channels unilaterally and 100 million transactions were in the mempool of all nodes suddenly, you would basically DDOS and insane number of bitcoin nodes.
We would see node counts in the single or double digits, and nodes with low specs would have a hard time joining the network, causing more trouble.
Such a situation would definitely warrant an emergency release to somehow blacklist those transactions... or something... not exactly sure what kind of band-aid would patch such a wound.
However, that being said, I think lightning is a major part in our way forward. (Moreso than side chains imo)

LN also requires a lot of huge overhauls to many systems and infrastructure.
A LN where there's only 1 BTC in any given channel (because people can't use the channels without having their keys on an online machine 24/7, and don't want to take the risk) is barely useful for any significant amount of value.
To remedy this, there needs to be a huge surge of cheap hardware based secure execution chips in all devices running LN.
Unfortunately, that is not a reality right now, so even if LN overcomes decentralized routing (The biggest hurdle) there are a lot more infrastructure changes that need to happen first.
I think LN is the right direction, but when I hear LN supporters, they tend to think that LN will be awesome and instantly solve all our problems... When in actuality, there are a huge number of problems facing LN uniquely.
Nothing is a cure-all solution. LN brings some advantages, but also some huge disadvantages as well.

Currently, the Electrum code checks to see if the length is 12 words. If so, it checks against the old mnemonic scheme.
If 13 words, then it checks using Electrum's BIP39 based slightly modified mnemonic system.
The old Electrum versions would 1. check that there was a multiple of 3 words. 2. check that each word was in the wordlist. and if these were true, it would calculate the seed regardless of phrase length.
You could have put in a 3 word phrase and used it if you just chose 3 random words from the list. And it would have worked.
Some people used this trick to make themselves 24 word phrases using old Electrum... shocked to discover that New Electrum no longer supported their seeds.
If you generated your own 12 word seed using electrum's old wordlist, you're fine. 15, 9 or any other number and you need the old version, or coding skills.

I think part of the reason for this is because a lot of mining operations calculate bitcoin's value 4-5x what it is now anyways when calculating costs.
If they were so short sighted as to calculate every day based on the price that day, they would be in a constant scramble to buy more asics / sell off asics every day.
I think a lot of miners are taking long positions on Bitcoin by either over-investing in equipment or not selling the coins, but rather taking out loans /investments to cover costs.

In their defense, they are investing tons of development resources into Proof of Stake, and then some guy steals an ungodly chunk of the total supply.
That basically says "ok, PoS is now attackable by this one guy if we implement it"
Plus, it is extremely likely that most of the big investors in the DAO were also big investors in the Ethereum ICO, all it would take is one of them to threaten Vitalik and he would fold like origami.
I'm sure Vitalik understands the absurdity of what he had to do to consensus in order to "fix" the issue, and there's no way he can publicly admit his disappointment.
So either he's putting on a mask, or he actually convinced himself that it was an acceptable outcome.

A looooooooot of people send fees that are set at pretty numbers like 0.001 or 0.005 or 0.01, and on average, transactions that pay pretty number fees are paying &gt;400 sat/byte.
This is most likely due to old software being used (pre-caring about fees) where the users of that software (probably corporate, so they don't care about paying devs tons of money to implement dynamic fees, they just bump the fee higher so they get confirmed quicker.)

$5 is a little less than 500k satoshis.
Even if your 509k satoshis was only one input, assuming the smallest possible transaction, you would still need 34k satoshis for the fee with the current fee market. Which would mean you can only send about 475k satoshis, or a little more than $4.75.
Coinbase is a little more expensive, but the fee market is always changing.
Today it might be 34k satoshis, but tomorrow you might need to pay 60k satoshis. Also, you fee depends on the byte size of your transaction, so if you spend 1 input, your fee is much smaller than if you spend 10 inputs.

You can find this info for spent addresses only. Every time you spend bitcoin, you must put forth your public key along with a signature and the network must verify that the public key hashes into your address (the 20 byte hash contained within the address, actually)
You can figure this out manually by:
1. figure out the address you want to check.
2. Look it up on a block explorer.
3. See if there are any "spending" transactions. (Addresses that have only had bitcoins sent to them will not reveal their public key)
4. Check the input script of the spending transaction to find the input containing the pubkey and extract it.

Now: Every node on the network enforces a rule that is hard coded. The power to change that rule lies not only with miners but every node that has significant economic value to it. (ie. if 100% of miners decide to hard fork and Coinbase decides to stay on the old fork, and since the miners obviously disagree, let's say Coinbase decides to change the POW algo to Scrypt and lower difficulty for the current period to attract Scrypt miners... I guarantee miners will scramble to mine their chain, as they have tons of users.)
BU: every node has code in it that says "look at the blocks, and if the miners say jump, you say "how high?""
Whether or not you believe that deciding the blocksize gives someone power or not, you can NOT argue that BU doesn't give more control over network attributes to miners than they had prior, because that is false.

Credit card payments can be charged back up to 3 months after purchase. Stores don't wait for three months to give you coffee.
However, the higher the amount, the more likely VISA is to look at the case thoroughly before processing a chargeback.
Similar (if not better) to that, bitcoin can guarantee no chargebacks after about 3 blocks, so 30 minutes or so, not to mention escrow multisig is possible to drive down chargeback time to 0 assuming the escrow is trustworthy (falling back to the VISA model)
tl;dr for coffees, 0-conf is fine. If you find your bitcoin user fraud rate is too high, stop taking it as payment. I have seen small stores cease to accept credit cards because they had high chargeback rates.

I have personally heard many users ask via support "I gave my friend / girlfriend one key of a multisig and she lost it, can I get my bitcoins back!?!?"
If you really must do this, make sure your friends understand how to back up their keys PROPERLY. (2-3 copies in 2-3 separate physical places)
Tell your friends to hold one copy of their key with their important documents. Then one more in a bank safety deposit box and tell them you will pay for it.
Then all three of you install Copay on your phones.
One creates a shared wallet of 2 of 3.
The second one then joins the wallet via QR code on the first person's phone.
The third one does the same.
Then all three of you open up the receive tab, and the wallet will tell you to backup your phrases.
Each one of you will have a 12 word phrase to write down. Write it down CLEARLY, IN PEN. So that anyone can read it in case of emergency. Readability is VERY IMPORTANT. (I have gotten many people asking "I can't read my own handwriting, can I get my bitcoins back please.")

Ahh yes, I remember when that one guy triumphantly lied to reddit and said "omg I signed up F2Pool to the full-RBF club" and F2Pool came on and said no.
RBF is not a solution to anything. It is a removal of a makeshift patch on a hole keeping a ship afloat. If you want to make the ship safer, make a replacement patch BEFORE removing the old one, OR build a strong patch ON TOP OF IT.

Just as you use ssh to log in and run the terminal remotely, the command I taught you will tell the server's ssh agent to wait for any packets coming through the tunnel and forward them as the user you log in as, as if you had logged in via ssh and generated the rpc command on the server itself.

Well, let's say the median size of a unilateral close transaction is 600 bytes.
100 million users close at once. That's 60,000 MB. At an average of 144 blocks per day, that's 417 days @ 1 MB.
The danger arises when the hub uses the confusion to attempt to send a previous state where they had more money, and as soon as that state enters a block, you have x amount of time to punish them. 
Assuming they didn't have an insignificant amount, you could take their punishment and put it all towards fees minus what you actually had in the recent state in hopes that miners confirm you within the wait period.
However, the idea of a "run on the banks" in a system where the worst outcome is losing your access to funds for a short while is not as likely as someone hacking a hub, recovering old states where the hub had more money in as many channels as possible, and the hacker just signs off all the previous states in order to cause a mass scramble to punish the hub (hurting the hub as well as masking another smaller attack on some other entity with the blockchain congestion)

LN then needs to preserve privacy by ensuring that there is probabilistically no way for one entity to control every hop from one entity to another. Which is difficult to prove.
That leaves us with "meh, it's most likely private... Prolly"

Credit Card payments took as long as 3-4 minutes to physically perform at most stores back in the early 90s where I lived.
The store clerk would walk in the back room, pull out a huge machine that looked heavy. Write stuff on paper, then place the card and paper on the machine and swipe it back and forth. Half of the time they needed to grab a manager to make sure they wrote things the right way.
That's how bitcoin feels right now.

Actually it's a function of blocks since input was confirmed AND the size of the input.
However, the reference client limits the amount of space for "free" priority based transactions to 50kB per block.
I have also heard reports that a lot of major mining pools disabled the priority slots completely.

If you are spoofing 100 nodes behind proxies, then your ability to block the propagation of non-segwit blocks is less potent than 100 actual individual nodes.
This is basically just putting out a node software that will impede the propagation of blocks proportionately to the number of people running it.
If miners think they can squeak by with just their special backbone networks, it will change nothing.
However, I can imagine that those special private backbones between miners will be suddenly congested once UASF starts.

Worst case scenario, your transaction gets rejected.
So just create a 0 fee transaction consolidating all the utxos into one address, hold on to the raw transaction and try sending it to as many mining pools as you can think.
Or do the same thing with a flat fee you're comfortable paying. ie, 1% (so 0.001 BTC) and hope the satoshi/byte rate is high enough to get confirmed at all. Wait a week or so.

Judging from your responses to everyone, you already seem to have your method set in stone with no intention of modifying it.
I am guessing you only made this post to have someone say "good job, brilliant method of managing payments!" and give you a pat on the back.
My opinion:
It's a very sloppy way to manage payments, and will cause you headaches down the road.
My suggestion is to not use bitcoind directly like you are now, and use the electrum payment request interface on top of bitcoind instead.
If your answer to that is "I don't use Electrum" then you obviously don't understand how to ask for advice.
A more polite way of responding to such advice would be "Thanks for the tip. Unfortunately, I have an entire service built around bitcoind newaddress calls already, and switching over to a new interface would take too much time. Could you elaborate on why you think bitcoind is not a viable method for accepting payments? Also, if you have any tips to reduce those problems at all while still utilizing bitcoind, I would greatly appreciate to hear them."
"I don't use Electrum" makes it sound like you don't want advice, you just want people to praise your method.

Coinbase was the last wallet to pay mining fees for its users.
I am not sure exactly how they are calculating the fees for outward sends, but just so you know, they are not profiting from that fee. The fee goes to the miners of the bitcoin network, and you will have to pay a similar fee every time you send bitcoin on the blockchain.
Up until now, Coinbase had been paying those fees FOR you without charging you anything, but they stopped doing that because the fees are getting so large, they were losing tons of money.
I recommend Copay, but just so you get an idea of the fees, my last few transactions paid the following fees (in satoshis) (newest to oldest) (I also added USD fee conversion for each date the transaction occurred):
1. 43800 ($0.47) (195 satoshis/byte)
2. 53400 ($0.59) (237 satoshis/byte)
3. 48800 ($0.60) (216 satoshis/byte)
4. 48600 ($0.56) (216 satoshis/byte)
5. 78000 ($0.93) (211 satoshis/byte)
Those fees are only paid by me on sending money. Receiving money is free for me (the sender pays the fee).
Recently, mempools have cleared up and the fast fees ("Priority" fees in the Copay app, which is what I have it set to) have gone down to about 140 satoshis/byte, but it's still not free.
My advice is that if you are doing business where a $0.50 per sending transaction fee is not good, (ie. you are sending $1 or $2 per transaction) don't use bitcoin for it.
@_date: 2016-02-16 23:40:00
Assuming worst case scenarios is sound financial advice. No qualms there.
The other side of the coin is that our current hashrate  is probably much more than we need. So eventually miners drop like flies slowly until we reach another equilibrium.
And the reason why this isn't happening is probably because a lot of miners are already so much in the red that turning back and selling off equipment seems impossible to them and they really are waiting on a 4-5x jump in price to then sell off OTC to some hyped up rich dude.

sha256 is used as an intermediary step in a lot of places, but very few of them end up leaving the direct result of the sha256 as pertinent data.
ie. The ECDSA used in bitcoin uses sha256 to make a digest of the message to use for signing. The ECDSA calculations don't actually run over the entire message data.
Also, the bitcoin addresses are the public key hashed with sha256, and then ripemd160.
The only real part where the direct result of an sha256 is pertinent in bitcoin currently is the hash of the transaction and the hash of the block header.

There is nothing in BU's code preventing a miner to both support emergent consensus over 1MB AND also set the Segwit BIP9 bit.
Not to mention that there are a lot of miners who still mine on Core, but just don't set their Segwit flag. (Probably mining on &lt;0.13 versions)
You would basically be enforcing UASF via SPV wallet, which could increase the danger of double spends, and should be thoroughly thought through. (As SPV wallets tend to be used for online purchases more often than full nodes)
Again, I have nothing against Samourai and their team. I just want people to realize that breadwallet is merely refusing to promise Core support because of technical limitations, and if Samourai makes any promises, it would require trust in Samourai.
Unless the user runs their own full node, in which case it is easily remedied by pointing the wallet to their own node.

Using gnu gettext and importing it "as tr" would make things a lot easier for people who wish to modify translations and view the changes in-app locally. One command to generate the po files, one option in the console (or ui) to switch languages.
Electrum actually imports it "as _" which means all translated strings are _(u"like this") and the user can build their own translations locally if they'd like to preview what they've done before submitting.

I can also tell you from experience:
Credit card companies will NOT let you sell bitcoins for VISA etc. (at least not in Japan) and any place that is selling for credit cards is going through a third party payment processor. (Those companies like the ones that handle porn sites and try to hound you and add extra charges to your card etc.)
They will literally sit down there, if they know your heart is set on CC sales, grab you by the balls and say "15% fee, or no go." and you have to comply.
I can guarantee you a LARGE portion of that markup is from a 3rd party credit card processor that has them by the balls. Maybe like 60-70% of that markup profit is going to some company like that, I am sure.

This is one reason I got into bitcoin.
The tax agency in one town (Japan has separate independent tax agencies for each town) screwed up their records, and even though I moved to a different town and did everything I was supposed to, they still thought I was living in their town and sent me invoices (to my old address with a "do not forward" stamp, preventing it to be forwarded to my new address) and called my old land line.
Then one day all my bank accounts were drained and frozen (the day before payday, and the next day's payday was also immediately taken).
I had no clue why, took me a month to get my money back, and had to borrow cash from friends and call my credit card company to set up a cash payment to settle (otherwise hurt my credit)...
I realized all this when trying to withdraw money to buy diapers (which we needed ASAP and the local drug store didn't take credit)...
Worst experience in my life.
No longer a problem with bitcoin. I can buy an amazon gift card within 10 minutes, and have Amazon rush me most things within 2 hours using Amazon Now.

The point being that you can prove the inputs of the most recent 100 blocks along with all mempool transactions are all valid using SPV verification of the merkleblocks on the outputs they refer to.
However the advantage over SPV is that you have done full verification once before.
The current pruning method is not as nuanced, and merely chops off all old blocks past a certain point. This opens up pruned nodes to attacks if they leave the network even for a short period of time... Which is one of the reasons why pruned mode disables certain features currently.
With pruning as it's currently implemented, I would worry about the integrity of the network if too many nodes used it.

BIP38 has no plausible deniability. You can be forced to decrypt or be held in contempt of court.
Or you can have a simple BIP39 backup phrase from Ledger/Trezor.
PLUS an extra password.
But the catch is, the passwords that you can add to a BIP39 phrase are all correct. Every password will make a brand new wallet... and using the same password twice will always give the same wallet.
So PhraseA + Password1 = Wallet1 (put 0.01 BTC in there or something)
PhraseA + Password2 = Wallet2 (put all the rest in there)
When the court orders you to decrypt, give up password1. You complied.

Trezor's password manager doesn't support mobile yet.
If you need mobile support, pay for LastPass (It's great) or setup Dropbox on your mac and mobile, then create a keepass database on your mac and save it in your Dropbox auto-sync folder. On your mobile, Android and iPhone both have good apps. Android is KeePassDroid by Brian Pellin, iPhone is MiniKeePass by Flush Software LLC.
In general, to avoid race conditions (a lag in dropbox sync causing your phone and mac to go out of sync with differing entries) I make it a rule to only add password on my PC. When I rarely do add passwords on my mobile, I make sure that next time I open my PC that the password has properly synced before I add any new passwords on my PC, (I make a memo for myself so I don't forget)
Dropbox automatically saves all previous versions of the file, so I'm sure you could fiddle around and recover old passwords if you accidentally overwrote something, but I just use one device for adding (writing) and the other device for reading (copy pasting for authentication).
I use Keepass btw, and it works very well... only gripe is that the mobile MiniKeePass password generator function is clunky, and doesn't automatically make an entry for you... you have to remember to click "create new" and paste the password you just generated... yet another reason I only add password using PC. PC and Mac Keepass clients are amazing.

If you send any counterparty asset to the address in this wallet, it will show up in your wallet balance.
Likewise, sending a counterparty asset from your wallet is a few clicks, but you need to spend bitcoin to send a counterparty asset (to pay the bitcoin network fees etc.)
Because of this need to receive and manage a bitcoin balance, the wallet makes it just as easy to receive and send bitcoin. Literally two clicks away.
Try sending like 50 cents of bitcoin to a new counterparty wallet you create and send it back to yourself. You will see how easy it is.

So not only was your example way above average fees being paid, even during crunch time (rarely does 1 confirmation go above 80 sat/byte) but it was 0.13% the total sent... which is insanely low for any sane payment method that will let you send 30k without KYC...... and it irreversibly settle within 10-20 minutes, as a plus.
Scalability is a concern, but spreading FUD by using outlying examples of people overpaying fees is not helping anyone.

Go here and try pasting it into the wallet details tab.
If the string is exactly 100 characters long, and it contains / and + and maybe = at the end, but no other symbols than those three... then you have a base64 encoded string that is 73-75 bytes of data.
It sounds to me like you signed a message and took a copy of the signature... but I don't know... try pasting it in to bitaddress, and see what happens... maybe you'll get lucky.

1. Download a wallet like Mycelium or Copay.
2. In Mycelium, find the "xpub" master public key of the wallet. In Copay this is in Wallet Details screen. it will start with "xpub" and tap to copy it.
3. install pycoin as requirement using `pip install pycoin`
4.  use this python script with the xpub string followed by the index of the address you wish to derive (0,1,2,3,4,5... in order, preferably)
The command would look like this.
    $ python bip32gen.py xpub6D3xEV8bs1KEaoU8XRgPe59fKjfFYH52coWK8Nejf2L9ENAnqNCvAYd4VVkd4i3sWxhSniq7CX75WdsR1bFwhDiMEJsPYdfktyBKuZdv342 3
    1DYQKT6x1UjEW6K9H2pQgcNsFh6fQr9kF9
You can run this command from any language you need, and it will write the address to stdout for you to use in the rest of your script... or you can look at the simple python script and write your own.
the xpubs given by most BIP44 wallets are the xpub of the m/44'/0'/a' key... where a is your account number starting with 0.
From there, you derive 0 for receiving address (which is what we want) or 1 for change address (we don't want)
then the final path is the key index, start with 0, count upward in order. maybe keep track of which index was shown to which user etc etc in your database.
Also, be careful, if there are 20 empty addresses with zero history in a row, Copay and Mycelium will not recognize them. They only generate a certain number of addresses, so to get them to recognize your money, you must generate a bunch of addresses with Copay or send some bitcoin to one of the addresses in Mycelium to trigger more address generations.

Let's do some math:
1. Average electricity bill in the US is about 10-20 cents USD per kWh (leave a 1 kilowatt draw device on for 1 hour is what the unit means)
2. AntMiner S9 costs $2,400 per unit.
3. Each unit draws 1,375 watts
4. They advertise 14 THash / s
5. Currently the network is running at 1.6 million THash / s
6. Assuming you have a steady income, you would make 14 / 1600000 of the 12.5 BTC reward every 10 minutes. Or about 0.00010937 BTC per 10 minutes. (6.6 cents at current price)
7. You're spending 13 cents (at best) per hour to run the miner, and gaining 40 cents. You are effectively earning 27 cents per hour.
8. To earn back the $2,400 cost of the unit, you would need to run it for 250 days.
9. However, during those 250 days, your machine will grow old and the mining speed will slowly decrease. The difficulty of mining will increase as more people join, giving you less money every hour. And most importantly, you will have to babysit the machines... a computer will crash, something will need a reboot, and every second you don't notice that and fix it is a wasted second you could have been mining.
Currently, the only people mining have hundreds and thousands of these kinds of special machines that cost thousands of dollars, and they have full time staff running maintenance on them to make sure all of them are up and running almost 24/7 and purring like kittens.

Every payment they send you will end up costing you 5 cents in extra fees when you try to send it.
So receiving 50 cents in one transaction as compared to receiving 50 cents total over three transactions will cost you 10 cents less when you try to send that somewhere.
So if they are sending you like anything below 10,000 satoshis, don't bother.
My estimation:
    roughly 150 bytes per input added to transaction
    roughly 60 satoshis per byte for fees
    9000 satoshis extra fees added on the transaction per extra input.
    9000 satoshis is about 5 cents

The namespace problem is not that simple.
heck, DNS registrars haven't got website domains figured out in a secure way (DNS is a mess) how do you suggest we do it for Bitcoin?
If you solve this problem, please tell everyone at IETF and get DNS replaced with your new system.
Hint: Namecoin tried, Ethereum tried, and a bunch of other blockchains tried and each had major problems.
The reason addresses are so secure is because the address literally contains the actual hash of your recipient's public key... so as long as you can be sure that the address you are sending to is ACTUALLY the address of your recipient, there's no way for a man in the middle to get between you.
(of course, there's the issue of the key exchange problem, which addresses are horrible at solving... BIP47 kind of makes this better, but is still not optimal)
tl;dr any namespace alias system for bitcoin addresses is just asking for man in the middle attacks.
Are you sending to аррӀе.com... or apple.com? (Those are two different domains, can you spot the difference?) etc etc etc

Who's corporate intranet is completely isolated from the internet?
Do these companies communicate with their clients via smoke signals? lol
The question you need to ask yourself, is that with a single point of failure, what are the advantages over incremented back ups with a traditional database? If you want to audit the trail, check your incremental backups.
The Blockchain is only useful in adversarial conditions, and one company using it internally with one guy holding the key is, by definition, non-adversarial.
I could understand an intra-bank blockchain, but they would still need to mine, as none of the other algorithms are reliable. (Small time alts running for years on them is not proof of reliability, just proof that those alts are not reward enough for people to waste time to break the coin.)
Edit: And at that point, you'd really ask yourself "is it worth putting in the infrastructure of mining cost-wise?" which comes up as "no" and you have banks using bitcoin blockchain protocols like Open-assets being tied to private databases that they will use to control assets backed by bitcoin's blockchain.

The cut off for removing the transactions from the old blocks would be 100 blocks.
So after every block arrives, check the 100th block and see which utxos the transactions in it spends... then go through and start removing those transactions' data from your blockchain.

1. A traditional database is like a spreadsheet where you can update any cell whenever you want.
2. A blockchain is like a "checkout sheet" for borrowing books or other items from a library etc. You never erase info, only write. You write when you check out, and when you check in. By writing the check in time, you are essentially "updating" the status of your one specific checkout.
3. Why do we use checkout sheets instead of a spreadsheet where we just erase and overwrite who has which books? Because it's easy to look back on who had what when.
4. How do we prevent bad guys from overwriting data on checkout sheets? Someone, like a teacher, or boss, or librarian is watching everyone writing on it. In blockchains, there are many ways to do this, one way (and to some, the "only way") is through a method called "Proof of Work", also known as "mining". Why are they incentivized to do the work to check for bad guys? Because, at least most of the time, they get paid for their work.

Yes. These are all things being proposed to alleviate bandwidth problems more than anything else.
The biggest problem with Bitcoin as it exists right now is that you are in effect receiving and sending every confirmed transaction twice. (once on the relay and once in the block) Therefore, by compressing blocks, or using inverted bloom filters, you can reduce the amount of data required to process one transaction significantly.
Anyone who looks at all these block size proposals and sees them as "proposals to fix the disk space scalability, only" should not be talking about how to scale bitcoin, imo.

You're looking at the wrong place for scaling concerns.
Storage is cheap, and will only get cheaper as time goes on. It's really not a problem, even for 8MB blocks.
However, the real problem is bandwidth. Whether it be a VPS or an at home internet connection, sending and receiving data is the biggest bottleneck, with second being RAM in terms of the utxo set.
When thinking about scalability the BIGGEST trap is to look at one aspect, see some leeway and crank up parameters blindly until that one parameter you're looking at is near its limit. There are other aspects affected that you are most likely overlooking.

1. Plug in USB port
2. Click something on PC or phone (tx send, auth password, u2f auth)
3. Verify contents on Trezor screen
4. Confirm or deny
5. Done
Adding in a new feature that goes against their simple UX flow will MAYBE save the small subsection of users who want to do this a few minutes of hassle by adding such a feature.
However, the detriment such a feature would have to a majority of users would be far greater. Sure, Trezor could put up warnings and bells and whistles to stop newbs from screwing themselves, but you know someone somewhere is going to say something like "Oh I thought this feature meant I could manage multiple phrases with one device, so I didn't write it down and sent 500BTC to it. Help."

The point is not that every user is an idiot.
The point is that every device, especially security devices, should not be swiss army knives.
Both from a UX perspective and a security perspective.
Smart phones have separate modules, each with one basic function. I should not add a bread toaster function to my smartphone's camera (using high powered lasers or something) no matter how much my users ask for it, because it will likely degrade the quality of the original functionality and add complexity (increase the possibility that someone will accidentally toast their face while taking a selfie) which lowers UX.
Also from a security perspective, adding firmware code that has to deal with the toaster increases the likelihood that a bug is included that would allow a hacker a backdoor into the phone.
Weigh that against the gains of including such a feature (less than 10% of the users save 2 minutes of their time maybe once or twice) and from a product manager's perspective the answer is definitely a "no, I won't even waste my time thinking about how to do this in a way that doesn't lower UX or security"
Now, if a competitor came out with the feature, and users flocked to them in droves, Trezor would likely try to mimic the functionality from a business management perspective. But that's another story.

It's harder to protect your wallet on a PC. MacOS, Linux, and Windows are particularly open by default, whereas Android OS and iOS were built from the ground up with all apps being "jailed" into tiny virtual spaces where they can not communicate with other apps storage etc. freely.
That's why all your phone apps always ask you "hey can this app use your camera?" That is your phone OS stopping the app from using your camera without your permission. When PCs usually just let any app use anything it needs all the time. (I think Windows asks you to approve to run the exe, but that doesn't tell you what the exe will access)
The most secure method of managing bitcoins with a PC involves booting into a non-persistent OS from a USB to generate a phrase and master public key to create a watch only wallet that will allow for offline signing.
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:01:50
Currently the plan is this:

2. use the last 16 bytes of the TXID to encrypt the data needed to punish. Send them the encrypted blob.
3. Cheater doesn't cheat, watchtower only has an encrypted blob and half a txid, and never learns the other half.
4. Cheater does cheat, watchtower sees the full TXID, is able to decrypt the blob with the second half of the TXID, and send a portion of the stolen coins to himself.

Question: Can a node differentiate whether a routed payment it is receiving was originated from the previous node or not?
One concern I had about running a routing node is that someone could steal my key from my server and send all my LN funds to some hacker over LN.
I thought one way to mitigate this would be if nodes specified "routing only" which would let people know that they don't want to ever SEND money, but only ROUTE it. Then the user could just make sure that the keys used for punishment/refund outputs does not store the private keys on the same server... then assuming they don't open large channels with hacker run sybil attack nodes, and all other non-malicious nodes respect the no-send setting... it would help mitigate risk for routing nodes significantly...
But from the sounds of it... you can't really tell if the guy before you is just passing something along or is the originator of the spend, can you?

It's not 100% though.
If 2 sat/byte are clearing, the difference in percent possibility that 5 sat/byte clears and that 500 sat/byte clears is negligible, 99.9% vs 99.999%
What is the difference you may ask?
* "What is the percentage likelihood that more than 4MW of transactions paying a higher sat/byte than my transaction will suddenly appear between now and when the block is found?" is the only difference.
Obviously, if 2 sat/byte are clearing, sending at 3 sat/byte has a higher risk since there is a chance the next block isn't found for an hour and people send transactions at 5 sat/byte... BUT if you send at 500 sat/byte, 99% of the sane people / people sending &gt; 1 BTC (in which 1000 sat/byte doesn't matter to them) will just ignore your "dumb" transactions and wait the extra X hours it takes to clear your stupidly high transactions.)
However, this is not always the case. If you look in the past week, there have been 4-5 times where suddenly 5-6 MB worth of non-segwit 100 sat/byte transactions appear.
So even if Bitpay sent a transaction with "insane" 40 sat/byte fees, they would still wait for 3 hours if suddenly another 5 MB chunk @ 100 sat/byte appears...
The only way to get around that and "guarantee" a next block confirmation is to enable RBF on the transaction and watch the mempool like a hawk, one-upping if some lunatic sends out 50 MB of insanely high fee transactions.
tl;dr adding nuance to your "100%" comment.

they are using the same tactic as CW
1. speak a bunch of gibberish that experts also can't understand because it's meaningless
2. at the end make an outrageous claim to further your agenda
3. experts will scramble to parse your gibberish to try and build a coherent argument against it, and fail, since you can't parse garbage.
4. if any expert says xyz makes no sense just say "you wouldn't understand"
5. normies who walked into the thread agreeing with the outrageous claim will lean on confirmation bias and any expert refuting the fraud is "dumb" and the fraud is an "expert" in their eyes.
The best way to deal with people who deploy such tactics is to ignore, do not engage, and educate.
same with anti-vaxxers.
The way to combat it is to actively teach people how things work and make them come to the sane logical conclusions themselves.
Then there are no gullible people left to be tricked.

I think the FUD techniques used for Segwit are similar to the FUD techniques for vaccines.

"Based on your 5 minute google search on how the segwit softfork trick works, did you know that MINERS COULD STEAL YOUR SEGWIT BITCOINS!?" (Ignore the fact that this would cause a hard fork, and you could also cause a hardfork by rewriting Bitcoin to say "all bitcoins can be spent by Jihan's private key as well." Which means Bitcoin Cash is equally as vulnerable.)

There are about 40-50 meaningful exchanges around the world. A large amount are using Cloudflare etc. so DDoSing the trading aspect of Bitcoin is irrelevant.
The best way to disrupt actual network function would be to go after the mining pools.
If you found a way to DDoS the top mining pools so that the miners that are disrtibuted around the world can not submit shares and/or valid block headers, then blocks won't be found, everyone's mempool will fill up, and fees will rise.
However, once the DDoS happens, a few things will start to work against the attacker:
1. Rising fees will mean that people use Bitcoin less or use it more efficiently than usual, decreasing transaction size, decreasing transaction count, and making it harder to "clog"
2. Miners can literally send valid block headers via morse code (a valid block header is 80 bytes) so in a worst case scenario, the pool could open private communication with their major members and skype the valid blocks if they wanted to... lol... but to be honest, pools also use cloudflare and akamai etc. for any and all outward facing APIs... so this again is kind of grasping at straws.
3. An attack on the p2p node network might just involve popping up millions of nodes that relay garbage data that looks convincing until you check the signature and it's invalid etc. (ie. formatting is all perfect, just the signature is wrong) but this is also sort of mitigated on a peer to peer level by the ban score each node will hold on your fake nodes. Unless you can significantly fragment the network somehow, it doesn't seem too possible... the best way to make this attack succeed would be to run millions of actual truthful nodes, then once you're convinced that your nodes are connecting large swaths of the network you could turn them rogue... (but this would cost a lot... you'd probably have to proxy a single node in a smart way to avoid having to store the whole blockchain on a million nodes that you plan to one day turn rogue.
tl;dr if you have a botnet with a firehose of "10000000000 EXABYTES PER SECOND OFMFGGGGGGG" there really isn't one specific place you could aim at that would "kill" Bitcoin, and "disrupting" it would at the very most just make 0 conf transaction reporting spotty or raise fees a little bit.

A private key is a number. A very large number.
Let’s make the numbers small so you can understand.
1 = apple
2 = banana
“Apple banana apple” would be 121.
Now lets make a rule.
1. For BTC, multiply by 10, LTC 100, etc. etc.
2. Add the number of the key to get the actual key.
So from our 121 master private key, my 4th LTC key is 121 x 100 + 4 = 12104
Just keep generating addresses from those and checking for balances until you find all the keys.

2. Show us the transactions on the blockchain, then we can get a better picture of what you're doing.
3. How did you open the channel? Was it using some website or crazy new thing? (A lot of sites develop their own wacky new way of using Lightning because it's not fully mainstream yet, trying to make it "easier to use" and just failing... so maybe you are using a website that is failing to understand how the lightning network works and is confusing you.)
4. Currently lightning network requires the recipient to be active. Meaning, you can't just paste one piece of info that anyone can send money to. For every individual payment you need to generate a payment request. So if you want to make a donation tool, you will probably need to generate a ton of invoices ahead of time with no amount specified and make a website that shows them one by one to visitors.

Do you understand how forks work?
You literally write into the forked chain “HEY EVERYBODY!

Good luck using Ledger’s “secret PIN” feature or Trezor’s optional password feature to trick them into thinking you only have 0.01 BTC when you actually have 1000000000000 BTC... they’ll throw the list of UTXOs you spent on Bitcoin Flufflegus chain and say “yeah, bullshit.

Like every other bitcoin transaction.
A Lightning Network channel is a bitcoin transaction. Nothing more and nothing less. This transaction can be broadcasted at any time by either party.
Whether it is a separate network or not has nothing to do with it in any significant way.
If a LN node goes down, or the LN network itself explodes, I can take my channels' transactions as-is and broadcast them on the bitcoin network as-is...
This is not a "side-chain" in any way shape or form. It's a bitcoin transaction being manipulated by two parties. Just like Copay, just smarter.

Note than all "light wallets" are not the same.
ie. Copay just queries a server and believes everything it says as is. Though it does verify that addresses are correct locally
breadwallet is a specific type of light wallet that performs SPV, or Simplified Payment Verification.
1. Connect to a few nodes on the network and tell them you're light, so you don't want any transactions or blocks unless you ask for them.
2. Ask for all the block headers, about 30 MB total currently.
3. Verify all the headers and the difficulty rules to make sure which is the longest chain of headers.
4. Create a bloom filter with your address public keys, and send it to all your peers.
5. Now, they will send you transactions that match your filter as they come, also if you ask for a block, they will give you a merkleblock instead, which means they will send you the hashes you need to verify your transactions are part of the block via the merkle root embedded in the block header, and the intermediate hash nodes needed to verify it.
6. Now you can know that your transaction was definitely included in a chain for which you have the blockheaders for. Since you can not verify every transaction, you don't know if the chain is valid or not, as you've decided not to care.

not necessarily... let's say they have $20 channels with all their customers, slowly flowing towards the company.
If a customer sends most all the funds of the channel to the company, they might start routing funds through the network to the company (for a small fee) OR top up the channel.
Then if the company needs to pay someone else for something small, they could split it up through a few customers channels and route it out into the network to pay someone else.
channel open and closes will only really happen when channel capacities are too small to transfer the money you need to get through, or you need to send a very large amount that requires unfreezing funds to pull an on chain transaction.
This assumes a fairly well distributed network.

Being one of the first exchanges in the world to support segwit, I can tell you that not many people, including engineers with a fairly good understanding of the benefits of Segwit, see segwit as a “must switch now!!!” feature.
Why? Exchanges withdraw from cold wallets 100s of BTC at a time, and even paying 160 satoshis/byte the final fee ends up being 0.001% of the amount sent. ($100 sounds like a lot for fees, but if it’s 0.001% of what you’re sending, no one really cares to decrease it to $50)
If we watched the fee market like a hawk, sent transactions with 1 sat/byte with RBF enabled, that would save much more money than just switching to segwit, but the consensus is “Decreasing fees spent from 0.001% to 0.000006% doesn’t give much benefit in the overall scheme of things, and adds the detriment of adding extra work to engineers who make more in an hour than the extra absolute fees saved.”
I pushed segwit through by just coding it myself and persisting to get people to review it.
Most exchanges won’t budge on the “save up to 50% on fees!” Argument.
You need to say “Upgrading adds value to Bitcoin as a whole.” and find an engineer in each company to take up the cause and push their peers and bosses to upgrade.

In Japan, China, and Korea, 4 digit amounts are important in their language, even though they also use SI units for measurements.
The term "millionaire" roughly translates into Japanese as 億万長者 or "the great person who has hundreds of millions and tens of thousands!" (1 0000 0000 is the first character and 1 0000 is the second character)
Also, since 1 USD is roughly 100 yen, 100 million yen is actually pretty close to being a millionaire.
The Bitcoin unit being 1億 satoshis could be an indicator of being Japanese OR a red herring meant to mislead.

P2PKH to P2SH-P2WPKH is only a 15% saving on input size.
You will save much more in fees by using a wallet that lets you set your own fees.
ie. Most wallets are paying 200 satoshis per byte when 5 satoshis per byte is fine. Thats a 97.5% saving compared to the 15% saving of segwit P2SH.
Note: the VSize calculations used for fee rate calculation is separate from the legacy block transaction size, which saves a little extra.
(Segwit saves the most blocksize and fees with multisig)

In GPG when you generate a key, you literally write the date you created that key on the key itself along with your email etc. and sign all of that using the master key, etching the date onto the key itself.
Craig’s key said “totes generated before 2009 y’all!” but the specific methodology of signature used by the key to etch the date on the key was not known, used, nor even added to the GPG software until long after 2009.
So the likely scenario is that he changed his PC clock to &lt;2009 and created a new key. Or compiled his own modified version of GPG to generate the key with a specific date.

You're absolutely right, which is why we implemented it on testnet in our dev environment first, then when it was activated on mainnet, we slowly rolled it out to a few of our high use (BTC deposits and withdrawals) users, and once we were sure that they had run our prod servers through the segwit gauntlet, we rolled it out to all our users.
We released full deposit support to all users 2 days after it activated.
We released hot wallet support a few days ago (we use Bitgo and were probably one of their noisiest customers about segwit... :-P
Now everything on our BTC management is P2SH based segwit.
I do understand that many companies probably didn't want to invest time into a feature they might not use... also one problem could have been they don't use testnet for their dev environment (yes, I know plenty of companies who do this... and I don't know why) and so they could not possibly test it.

As long as the app doing the signing is RFC6979 compliant, you should have no problem.
If it isn't, then whether or not you have a problem relies on the strength of the randomness your app's random number generator can provide)

Bitcoin Cash differs from current Bitcoin rules to say "if you use segwit, any miner can steal your coins"
Why? Because Bitcoin Cash was made for the sole purpose of spite towards Segwit.
So, while your Bitcoin will be safe no matter what, if you have not already redeemed your Bitcoin Cash after the fork, some miner could replay all your bitcoin transactions all the way up until you sent them to a segwit address and the miner could then steal the Bitcoin Cash that they represent.
It's hard to wrap one's head around, I know.
But tl;dr your bitcoins are safe, but your "Bitcoin Cash coins" may not be safe if you accidentally send your Bitcoin Cash to a Bitcoin (or Litecoin or any other Bitcoin-like coin with segwit) segwit address, or have yet to redeem them since after the fork.
Do you own any Bitcoin Cash? No? Then nothing to worry about.
Anyone on the Bitcoin Cash side trying to blame Bitcoin for the problem are wrong. Bitcoin Cash developers can easily fix the problem. They just choose not to.
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:36:24
That doesn't help. The problem isn't the message, the problem is the random k value during signing.
If two different messages signed by the same private key use the same k value (which means the same r value of the signature) then you can calculate the private key.
Also, if you can guess the k value (due to bad randomness) all you need is one signature to calculate the private key.
tldr RFC6979 is what you need. What tool are you using to sign? I'll tell you if it uses RFC6979. A github link would help.

No one is disallowing anyone to do anything.
Think of it from a dev's perspective who isn't a dick.
"Hmm, I want to make this change, but people on mainnet currently could lose money... hmmmmmm..."
Odds are they make some compromise or dumb down what they want to do because even if a bunch of people are throwing their money into a machine and they say "yo bro, you do what you need to do to make this machine as great as possible! we don't care if you burn our money!"........ you still have 500 people standing there staring at you as you change the machine... and even if they say "we don't care" you might subconsciously make decisions so as not to turn even a small portion of those people into an angry mob.
Sure, if I break it, I can say "well, that's what you signed up for"... but here's what will definitely go down:
1. r / btc will never drop it. "LN LOSES SHIT TON OF MONEY! SHITTY DEVELOPERS HARHARHURHUR!" for YEARS.
2. a small percentage of the users might get angry with pitchforks... but an even larger percentage will show up and passive aggressively act like someone owes them a tutorial on how to get their money back. Pressuring devs, taking away time from them.
No one wants to be the guy that pulls that trigger.
So yeah, do whatever you want... but don't throw 100% of the responsibility on the devs saying "well, it's THEIR FAULT for worrying about our money when we told them not to."
People worry about things, and as human beings we need to be conscious of what our actions affect around us and in other humans we depend on.
Edit: But yeah, if someone using mainnet tries to complain. Shut that shit down ASAP. In fact, if I were a r / btc shill manager, I would keep a close eye on LN breaking changes in the 3 implementations and make a bunch of FUD posts about how someone lost so much money... then be like "oh well, I guess LN is 18 months away like r / btc said.... *wink*"

@_date: 2017-09-28 23:59:04
But the law is referring to currency as in fiat and foreign currency.
Bitcoin is already recognized by the govt. as virtual currency which is not currency. Virtual currency is not a subset of currency under the law, it is a separate classification. This makes sense, because you don’t want laws made for paper money to automatically all be rules for something that is completely different.
Sure this one law you cherrypicked would be a good one to carry over to virtual currencies, but there’s an ocean of shitty laws you don’t want anywhere near our Bitcoin.

A private key is basically like a big long password that you should never pick yourself, as the requirement for randomness is much too complicated for you to ever remember...
However, the best compromise yet is a system where the private key is condensed into a 12 - 24 word phrase that is randomly generated from your app.
This makes it easy to write down. And a little bit easier to memorize than some 34 character random thing. (with 12 words you could make up a creative story to help remember)
The best practice is to write down your phrase on paper and store it in a safe place with other important documents. That way if your phone blows up, you can re-download the app on your new phone and import the phrase to restore your private keys and regain access to your bitcoins.
For a tl;dr technical explanation: A private key can be turned into a public key. There is only one private key per public key, and the number of key pairs is more than the number of atoms in the universe. With a private key and a message, you can generate a digital signature. With the public key, the message, and the digital signature, I can verify that the signature was made using the private key connected to the public key WITHOUT needing to see the private key. (Unlike credit cards for example, which have the secret data printed on the card)

That is a very dumbed down version of "hardened derivation" which is a feature in HD wallets already.
Basically, you can choose to either:
1. Have the ability to derive unlimited addresses from a master public key AND have the vulnerability of losing one private key and its Master Public Key allowing someone to derive all private keys.
2. NOT have the ability to derive unlimited addresses from a master public key BUT be safe from one private key leaking all private keys under the Master Public Key.
The weakness is inherent in the "Master Public Key can derive unlimited addresses without knowing a private key" math, so there is no way to mitigate it without removing the feature all together, OR coming up with a new way to Derive public keys without knowing the private keys.

Basically, take the 20 byte pubkey hash from your normal 0x00 address, then add 0x0014 in front of it so now you have 22 bytes, then take that 22 bytes and hash160 it, which gives you 20 bytes. Take those 20 bytes, and add a 0x05 byte at the beginning and Base58check encode it.
That will give you the P2SH-P2WPKH address.
However, creating the transaction and signing the transaction will be completely different, so make sure you are generating and signing transactions using a library that understands it.

I don't think their long term play is to ACTUALLY take over development.
Their plan is to fork the network, and once everyone switches over to BCH, they assume Core will put out a bug-free version of a BCH client, and they can go back to whatever they were doing before the whole UAHF thing happened.
They probably have some sort of strategy that involves some of the big BTC hodlers (Ver etc.) and timing some sort of huge BTC dump to coincide with some big event.
I'm guessing they're planning to dump once 2x shows that it failed.

You do have to be online though. When the user sends the payment to that invoice, your PC or SP or whatever needs to perform the state changes of the last hop (to you) and also reveal the HTLC preimage so that every hop of the payment can close out their HTLC and move back to a state of no HTLC outputs.
So yes, you DO need to be online to receive payments... but that is not a problem... that's like saying "you have to have your phone online to receive push notifications....."
But to be honest, I would rather be able to reject payments on will.
Bitcoin et al being a push only mechanism has caused MANY problems in the past, and is a pain to deal with sometimes. (ie. NEVER THROW AWAY PRIVATE KEYS!!! because some user will send 50000000000000000BTC to an old address you gave them 36287678 years ago and say "oh btw that Yacht you sold me, I sent you the money to an old address I saved on a floppy disk in the 80's, that's ok, right?" and now you have to go and find that private key in a landfill or something...)

Yup. MITM attacks are a bitch.
Also, the key exchange problem still exists from between your Ledger and your eyeballs.
Where are places that someone could MITM you? This PDF points out one, the Javascript that creates the page you look at and copy paste from.
Obviously there is less issue with the screen on the ledger/trezor, since the only way you could get in between the secure chip and the monitor would be infecting the firmware chip directly, or somehow adding in your own hardware (via physical attack) to replace addresses in transit from the secure chip to the screen... (idk if they have something to prevent this)
The key exchange problem is probably the biggest problem in cryptography besides the double spend problem... I like the way keybase is trying to solve it... but it would be nice if Keybase was a little bit more blockchain reliant and also open sourced the backend so people wouldn't have to host their data with Keybase (and Amazon by extension)...

Regardless of how big the other outputs are if any single one of the outputs has a value below 546 satoshis and is not an OP_RETURN script, the transaction fails standardness rules, and will not propagate through nodes with default settings.
However, it is still a valid transaction, so if a miner decides to include your transaction then that transaction will be valid, and the 1 satoshi output can be spent as an input freely (input values don’t trigger dust rules at all)

not at the transaction validity level.
Their replay protection is merely at the standardness level, so if a valid UTXO on BCH chain has a chain of transactions on the BTC chain that uses only UTXOs that are valid also on BCH chain... a miner could just include (replay) all the transactions leading up to the segwit output, and then steal the segwit output.
Also, there are likely many people who hold BTC from before the fork that their first move on BTC would be to a segwit address, making it easy for miners to notice, replay the transactions leading up to the segwit deposit and steal the segwit UTXO.

Example: you manage a full node, but all your funds are in a Trezor.
If every time you receive or send a transaction you are relying on mytrezor or some random Electrum server, there are many ways they can lie to you. Trezor could outright lie and say you received something you didn’t, as client side there is no SPV checking. Electrum does SPV checking but they could lie through omission.
Now, if you install the Electrum server software on your node, then connect Trezor to Electrum, and connect Electrum to your node (which is now an Electrum server) THEN you are your own bank.
Trezor is a tool for trustlessly managing your private keys, and it works well. Bitcoin Core is a tool to verify all payments validity to verify the blockchain.
If you’re just running a node and not using it, helping a tiny bit to ensure all nodes don’t come crashing down... but that’s only if you run it from your home.

Then when BTC withdrawals were halted... the strategy changed to "If Gox owes me USD, I will have a stronger legal ground to stand on when suing them..." so everyone sold all their BTC for USD. Then Gox went bankrupt.
"Price going up" = "Everything is a-OK everybody, nothing to see here!" is not necessarily true, is all I'm saying.

bitcoind checks all vouts, if any of their amounts is less than 546 satoshis, bitcoind will fail isStandard and refuse to add the transaction to their mempool and refuse to propagate it.
However, if a miner includes that same transaction in a block, the transaction is not invalid.
Transactions with any dust outputs are non-standard, but still valid.
However, it should be noted that standardness rules are not consensus rules, so if you just so happen to propagate to a node that ignores the dust rule and they pass it along to a miner who also ignores the dust rule, you could get it mined.
Sending 546 satoshis instead of 1 will guarantee that anyone with default bitcoind settings will propagate your transaction for you.

Re: original comment: What?
Re: edit: I'm not confusing anything. You're the one getting mixed up with a bunch of terms and not understanding what's going on.
Test it out: Open up Electrum, try to send 1 satoshi to any address. Electrum will throw an error. Then go into the code and disable the error in Electrum's code and create/sign/broadcast the transaction with a single 1 satoshi output and whatever change in a second output.
Broadcasting will return an error from the network class (aka, an error returned by the Electrum server that tried to broadcast your transaction) stating "could not send: dust."
Then try again with 545 satoshis. Same.
Then try with 546 satoshis, and it will go through.
The related code in bitcoind is here:
(To be more specific, 546 satoshis is for a normal P2PKH txout. It will actually be less if the txout is raw segwit (not P2SH segwit) also, P2SH txout will be 2 bytes smaller, so dust is 540 satoshis to be precise)

Usually CPFP is when the recipient of BTC realizes the person who sent to him forgot to place a sufficient fee, and covers the fee for the sender by creating a second transaction to increase the total average fee for both transactions.
You CAN use CPFP for your own transactions IF you have a change output to spend, but if not, you’re out of luck.
Usually RBF is used for sending fee adjustment and CPFP is used to accelerate incoming BTC.

Segwit is not safer than multisig, since Segwit has nothing to do with multisig or not. Ledger's current "Segwit" wallet is single sig only.
You are asking if apples are more orange-like than oranges.
Currently there are no wallets supporting multisig segwit scripts, so you will need to wait until your wallet switches from old multisig to segwit multisig.
Also, in order to exploit segwit scripts using the old anyone can spend rules, you would need to hardfork the network. Hardforks can do anything at all, so if you are worried about losing money to segwit now, why weren't you worried before that Miners could hardfork and say "all output scripts can be collected by Jihan's private key"?
You weren't worried because miners can't hardfork without user consensus. And that's why you shouldn't be worried about Segwit outputs being steal-able.

Encryption is not a method of creating passwords. It is a method of using passwords to change a cyphertext into a jumbled mess that no one can understand.
BIP39 mnemonics have a salting mechanism built in that allows you to have infinite wallets sprouting from one mnemonic phrase.
No password will get you wallet A (default wallet)
Password "abc" will get you wallet B
Password "xyz" will get you wallet C
So on and so on.
So you're not encrypting your seed, you're leaving it open. But hiding the wallet behind infinite alternate wallets.
i.e. I could put a few dollars worth in my default wallet, and store the wealth of my stash in a password salted wallet. Then if someone says send me all your bitcoins, you don't enter any password, and send the small amount.
You could even create like 20 fake passwords with varying amounts in them etc. or whatever you wanted to do.
Just because you hear the word "encryption" and think it sounds cool does not necessarily mean it's the best option for you.

Lesson to be learned for any software devs:
Any code making raw transactions should ALWAYS SANITY CHECK BEFORE SIGNING. If the difference of the outputs and inputs are more than 100 * MIN RELAY TX FEE (or some arbitrary amount that would signal error) there should be red flags everywhere.

So the logical solution is of course: Wait for 250 confirmations and require a 500 BTC fee for every transaction. /s
As long as at least one wallet exists with that ability, criminals will ALWAYS have a method to send 0 fee / long chains of unconfirmed and it will ALWAYS be available to non-technical users.
So by reducing your wallet's user experience (which very well could be perceived as "bitcoin is slow" in general by someone who is introduced to bitcoin via your app) you have effectively prevented 0 crime and protected no one... but you drove users away from your wallet in exchange for that nothing.

Doesn't really work.
1. BIP38 specifies nothing about p2sh or how to handle multiple private keys. You could replace it with "encrypted in some way" and it would fix it. BIP38 is not equal to encryption, BIP38 is a specific method of encryption with many many many rules based on the assumption of only encrypting one private key for the purpose of creating a single bitcoin address.
2. This would be less than instant, as you are still relying on no re-spend attempts towards the funding transaction send to the multi-sig. You say the answer is "have ITB watch the blockchain" but then the question would be "why not just have ITB watch the blockchain without the multisig private key sending thing and just have them be a 'blockchain watchdog service' or something like that."
3. There are already WAY better proposals out there with a LOT less counter party risk. (google the lightning protocol)

1. Just because its free doesn't mean you won't lose value from minig. ie. your bills may be free, but your building might only support up to 30A of throughput before blowing a fuse. This would mean that you would (depending on your unit) be running 1-2 expensive hair dryers 24/7... causing any little thing (turning on your microwave, any sort of heating mechanism like hair dryers, curling irons etc.) blow a fuse and shut down electricity to your whole house. Dealing with this can be super annoying, and depending on your building, expensive to repair.
2. If you have 0 running costs, then you need to figure out how long it will take to recoup your initial investment. (cost of equipment)... there are many sites that will calc this for you... but to be honest, a "PC" will not mine anything more than pennies a day, unless you also get that PC for pennies (or free) then it won't be worth it... and even if you did get a free PC, I could make $4 an hour working at McDonalds... soooo is it really worth the effort?
So if you have free electricity:
1. Check the capacity of your building, also check the voltage and capacities of all plugs you will plan to use.
2. Find an ASIC miner that is relatively new. If you have free electricity you might be able to squeak past breaking even with a second hand miner that just recently became not profitable for the people paying electricity.
3. Check to make sure your capacity can withstand the wattage of the ASIC you want to buy.
4. Buy the ASIC.
5. Set it up and let it run. Check on it periodically to make sure it isn't just doing nothing (check the shares you've submitted to your pool occasionally)
This will take weeks of studying, research, planning, etc. And if your time is valuable, I would say that breaking even, when considering the amount of time you pour into it, will be difficult.

I feel your pain on the misunderstandings of people, and seeing someone whom we sort of idolize in the community get something wrong that we see so much ignorance about is disheartening... I know...

I agree that shooting him an email and explaining the history of the FSM and RMS and his contributions to everything that lead up to GNU/Linux distros (aka "Linux" to most people)...
RMS is a fighter for freedom, and Linus is a very good project manager and great coder that is running one of the biggest collaborative projects on the planet.
Discounting Linus's contribution is just as bad as discounting RMS.
This is just a guess, but if FSM finished their Kernel and ignored Linux, and FSM had their camps of OSes with their Kernel and GNU, and other camps had their OSes with Linux and GNU... I am fairly certain that the Linux+GNU OSes would still be much larger than the FSM OSes... primarily because even now many distros are "tuned" to the FSM ways, and they just aren't that popular....
It's something I run into every day at work: we want to add every possible security feature under the sun and force it on all our users... but then everyone would use our competitor... be less secure, AND we lose our user base.
If the only choice was to use 100% free software or use Windblows 10 and MacdaddyOS...... many.... many more victims would fall into the hands of those companies...
So while I feel your pain, I think we should approach AA and bring up the fact that RSM did a large portion of the heavy lifting for the first GNU/Linux distros. Make friends instead of shunning people for not knowing/not acknowledging.

1. You somehow incorrectly typed the 4.6 BTC output information (invalid bitcoin address etc.) and missed the error message/clicked through it.
2. You signed the tx with only 1 output (13.3999BTC)
3. blockr's api threw an error for large fee. But coinb.in treats all errors from blockr as just "error"
4. blockchain.info is blockchain.info
coinb.in's creator basically made it as an advanced tool for quasi-almost-developer-type people who understand bitcoin at a lower level than most, but can't really code.
Because of this, I think to have "hand-holding" excessive warning messages in succession or things that prevent users from doing stuff outright might go against the whole "tool to do anything" aspect.
Sorry for your loss, and I hope you get it back.

Your point was that stupid normies shouldn’t be allowed to verify the whole blockchain for themselves. Let them trust the miners.

However, I think that would be your best bet if you want to use Trezor.
Copay is working on Trezor support (current head has ledger support for Chrome) but that still requires 1 node + 1 insight-api (takes a few days to parse blockchain into a DB) + 1 bitcore-wallet-service (which is easy to set up)
In the end you will need something on top of your node, until Armory, Core, or some other direct-node-wallet supports Trezor.
Electrum server requirements aren't THAT bad, really.

Coincheck requires only an e-mail address for merchants that do less than 50,000 yen of business per day.
Bank info is only necessary if you decide to withdraw in JPY
ID info only necessary if you plan on doing more than 50,000 JPY per day
Their website has a "Sell on Tablet" option that lets you punch in a number of JPY and it automatically creates a payment page on the spot.
Just keep the Sell on Tablet page open, type in the amount in JPY, and within seconds of payment a green check mark will show up indicating payment to the merchant.
Very simple, and they have an option to change everything to English.
No ID required if you stay low income and stay bitcoin, so I recommend just testing it out yourself.

Rate limiting can not be done with proper bitcoin wallets (brute force resistance non-withstanding) and adding stupid requirements does not really increase entropy by any meaningful amount.

"You had me at *" is a joke playing off the stereotypical positive response to sexual advances: (ie. You don't need to keep trying to woo me, I already was interested when you said the word *)
So the rational response to such a shirt is to ironically make a response that sort of emblifies the "sleezy pickup line artist" type that would be the receiving end of such a response as was on the shirt.
It's called having a sense of humor.
Sure, some people may have looked at the picture, and making no consideration for the proper response for the joke, are just horn dogs that made responses that coincide with "sleezy pickup artist" because they are that type of person...

The problem is that buying and storing bitcoin is like one of those choose-your-own-adventure books.
I could write a step by step with every possibility and choice, but it would be a book and not be simple and probably be old as soon as I'm done writing it lol.
1. Sign up for an exchange that serves your area. (Tons of choices and depends on where you live. Some places have different rules and don't serve people who live in certain areas.) If you're in the US check out Coinbase or Gemini.
2. Send them the info they need to verify your account. This is kinda privacy invasive... but not any worse than the info a bank would need to open an account.
3. Once verified, wire them some money from your bank account. No Paypal, No Venmo... bank wire. Welcome to the future of money, you're almost there, lol.
4. There are super simple "BUY BITCOIN" button on Coinbase... but this usually gets you a slightly (3-4%) higher price of cost... if you want to look into how trading works, have fun with that. (Hint: place a market buy order a couple cents below the last price and wait until your order is filled (you buy the bitcoin) if you don't know what this means, the simple buy button might be worth it)
5. Once you have Bitcoin on your exchange, you must withdraw it, as the exchange is holding your bitcoins, but you want to hold your bitcoins because otherwise they could steal your bitcoins just like how everyone in Cyprus had their money stolen out of their bank accounts and everyone with BTC in Mt Gox are still fighting almost 4 years later. (hah, insured deposits my ass)
6. Here comes the part that has THE MOST choices. Bitcoin Storage. tl;dr (this is my opinion) if you plan on buying more than $1000 of bitcoin, Buy a Trezor and send your bitcoins to your Trezor. If you want to buy less, I would recommend installing a Bitcoin app on your smartphone and making sure your smartphone is locked down tight. (PIN code or fingerprint or whatever) (If it's rooted or jailbroken, you'd better hope that nothing has access to the sandboxed app of your bitcoin wallet)
7. Now just make sure that once your bitcoins start going up in value, the cost of a Trezor comparatively will go down (ie, if you invest $500 and it goes 100x you now have $50,000 you need to protect, so $100 is cheap) so once you start feeling uncomfortable walking around with that much money on your cell phone, move most of it to a hardware wallet.
This is a basic overview of the process without getting into the details that are specific to one choice you make. The only real recommendation made is Trezor... some people prefer Ledger Nano S... that would be fine too.
Unfortunately, unlike your bank app or venmo, Bitcoin is not some numbers on a database... so getting your hands on them is a little bit harder.
However, if you ignore exchanges, and already have a wallet app, a friend could send you $100 almost instantly and you just hand him cash. Done deal.
Being a newb is hard in Bitcoin. It really helps if you have a mentor. Being introduced in person, and someone to field questions you think of on the spot is the best imo.

the algorithm is chosen by popular vote.
If the bitcoin network adopted a "999% inflation rate forever lololol" then bitcoins would lose scarcity and thus miners would lose income (as they receive their payment in bitcoins) as price of bitcoin goes down.
So the incentive structure is made in such a way that the network as a whole will choose the methods that make it most secure and profitable for miners.
Then of course, the miners all compete to drive each others' margins to pennies.
The free market at work, and at the core of the voting / verification mechanism no less.

The server has always stored the public keys.
The only difference between 0.9 and beyond is: (the change you are talking about, likely)
1. The server is open source, and separated from insight block explorer so that you can run the Copay server without holding the blockchain. Making the barrier to entry much lower.
2. The server no longer holds any PRIVATE keys. It used to hold encrypted private keys for you, but now it doesn't.

Tell them "100 bits is about 7 cents right now, but if you want to buy a whole bitcoin, which is one million bits, that's about $700"
If you start off with "one bitcoin is $700" they immediately think "oh, so I need to put up $700 to buy one... screw that." and don't think too much of it.
You need to let them know it's divisible without saying "It is divisible up to 8 decimal places." as most people will shut out your words the second you say "divisible" because they just don't like hard words.

His point was "200 ish to 1000 ish is a 400% increase, and 1000 ish back to 200 ish is an 80% decrease. However, in the past there were much larger relative swings from 0.75 ish to 30 ish to 0.25 ish which is like a 3900% increase then a  99.2% decrease."

Not trashing. Just pointing out they have had multiple security issues caused by incompetence.
I would never trust an app they wrote to touch my private keys. I would have 5 years ago, but not now that they have a horrible track record.
Just because a service was good at one point, and helped out the industry at one point does not mean we have to continue singing their praises after the umpteenth security issue where "oops wrote true instead of false and now 5000 users all generated the same exact "random" private key!" and then their customer service decided: "hmm, since we can't access their encrypted archived backups to verify whether they had an address in their wallet at a certain point in time........ so rather than creating a secure tool that customer support can tell the customer to go to and confirm their wallet securely... how about we ask them on reddit to DM us their password" *facepalm*
You could argue "oh, well they're a large company with tons of users, give them a break if they make one or two slip ups."
To which I would say that one or two, yeah fine... they've slipped up majorly at least 10 times causing loss of user bitcoins.
That being said, I don't deny they were a great stepping stone in the industry.
4 digit PIN codes on phones were also a great stepping stone in security, if we asked everyone to set 16 character passwords with symbols etc. to unlock their phones. No one would use a smartphone.
If bc.i didn't make some iffy decisions about security, a lot of people wouldn't have signed up for bitcoin wallets back then...
But hey, if you want to use a 4 digit PIN that's 1111 on your phone or use bc.i as your bitcoin wallet. More power to you.

breadwallet is SPV as well, and can still have privacy issues with sybil attacks etc. (ie if someone was able to make sure the 3 nodes you connect to are THEIR nodes, then they can get a pretty good guess at your balance.)
The best privacy is using a direct node connecting SPV where you only connect to an SPV node you control.
AFAIK, Mycelium is looking to support that, however, their Trezor support currently queries their servers... and I am not sure if they will code it in to create bloom filters based on the Trezor xpubs.


It is, but in exchange for that, you get the best privacy available.
Though, once Copay supports Trezor, Node + insight + BWS + Copay app (tons of platforms :-) ) will be the best option imo.

"Extend the LN protocol" by implementing something that has nothing to do with LN.
Are exchanges that manage you private keys with bitcoin "extending the protocol?"
No they are not.
The whole purpose of LN is to create a payment layer above bitcoin that requires as little cost of trustlessness as possible.
Sure, payment hubs might try to do stuff like that, but they will come to the realization that it is cheaper to just have a database of some loyalty points, as an LN transaction that is not properly anchored to the blockchain will not be able to send on LN without changing the fundamental way the network works. Which is basically just a company created altcoin based LN with no compatibility to bitcoin's.

Sipa, btcdrak, Nicholas Dorier, etc. these are all people who are widely accepted as "Core Devs" but really were just concerned coders who worked on tiny things, and those tiny things became bigger things and then everyone kinda just accepted that they were a "Core Dev."
It's not some sort of evil committee. You contribute code, review code, do regression tests, OR just participate in discussions with rational thoughts (no trolling, that will get you ignored by any dev within 2 seconds) in a non-confrontational manner, and even if you have a differing opinion than most, they will listen and critique your contributions.
A primary problem with the idea of a "top down" development conception is that there is no top or down, but people just don't realize that they can affect Bitcoin Core's decision making processes easily if they just contribute.

You are confusing validation with confirmation.
When you spend / credit your card, VISA etc. validate you have the card and then send a signal back to the register saying "its all good, give the guy his coffee"
However, there is a 3 month period where the transaction could be reversed on a whim and the merchant would not actually receive the money for your coffee. This is called a chargeback.
Finally, after 3 months or so, the money is deposited to the coffee shop's account.
With bitcoin, you scan a qr code with Bitpay / Coinbase, and within 1-2 seconds a green check mark pops up saying "it's all good, you can give the guy his coffee"
However, if a person with enough technical ability, and the drive to steal a coffee wanted to put their mind to it, there are some ways that they can attempt to swindle the store with some custom wallet software or an accomplice who has administrator access to a large mining pool. Most of which are easy to detect within seconds of the transaction, and none of which have a 100% success rate.
After 10 minutes, on average, it's settled.
Every 10 minutes after that, the amount of work needed to undo the blockchain goes up exponentially.
Most high value transactions deal with shipping / signing contracts, which takes time anyways... I would be pressed to find a ferrari dealer that will let me walk out with a ferrari in less than 10 minutes.
And for coffee, if anyone makes you wait 10 minutes tell them they have a warped view of how bitcoin works.
There ate proposals in the works to make validation AND confirmation BOTH instant... So even the people who are slow on the uptake can follow bitcoin, I'm sure.

They've been working on a Kivy version for over a year now, and that was SUPPOSED to be released along side 2.0... but there were problems with the developer that was hired (afaik Thomas, the maintainer, does not have much experience with Android or iPhone development) and now the project is stuck in limbo.

84% of miners collude to shut out any blocks not supporting segwit would mean that their BU blocks would effectively be 0% of the hashrate.

Because nothing in the protocol is stopping me.

coinb.in is the only one I know.
Some people are going to be in for a rude awakening too, as coinb.in had a bug when they first implemented CLTV where the timestamp value was big endian instead of little endian, meaning that, depending on the second they chose in time, their bitcoin could be locked for 500 years when they thought they were locking it for 1 year. Or it could be locked until March 1971 instead of 8 months from now, etc.
Not to mention that locking for any period of time longer than a year or so is stupid, as 10 years from now ECDSA could be broken, or your private key could be stolen before then. (Normally if your keys were stolen, or thought to be in a dangerous position, you would want to send to a new address asap... can't do that if they're locked)
CLTV and CSV are best used in conjunction with second layer protocols.
BTW, if anyone wants to verify whether their coinb.in redeemscript has the correct date in it or not, here's a javaScript one liner to verify the date. (It will not work for block height TL)
    new Date(parseInt("pasteYourRedeemScriptHere".slice(2,10).replace(/(..)/g,"$1 ").split(" ").reverse().join(""),16)*1000).toString()
Enter this in the javascript console of your browser (Ctrl + Shift + J for Chrome) and it will show you the date and time of the timelock written in the redeemscript.
Edit 2:
Looking at github, it is unclear whether the broken endianness commit was ever merged before being fixed. I think it might not be... so there's probably nothing to worry about.
But it just goes to show that any wallet implementing this going forward might screw that up somehow.

A sustained hardfork on Bitcoin would destory both forks credibility just as the sustained hardfork in ETH/ETC has destroyed all credibility for the Ethereum (company) team and the ETC team.
If you don't like the softfork, put up hashrate or shut up. With a hardfork there was no way to stop the damn thing, but if theDAO HF was a SF somehow, the people who oppose it would get a say by putting their hashrate behind a non-supporting client.
You have the whole thing backwards.

Currently there is no such thing as a segwit address.
Initially all segwit transactions will use P2SH, so old wallets will show balances received from inputs using segwit, and any app that checks the script will view it as a valid anyone can pay script sitting behind a p2sh script.

@_date: 2017-10-23 13:46:39
I worked on them for a while. I had a patch for using them with Electrum... but then it died so I stopped rebasing after 1.9.7.. I also added sending to them to coinbin.
The main problem of their development was no one wanted to make compromises, which made the protocol unmanageable.
Then dark wallet devs went dark.
Then BIP47 came out as a compromise of Stealth.
Then only one wallet implemented BIP47.
And here we are.
It’s not that no one cares.
It’s that, unlike alts that have the luxury of spending all their time on one feature, bitcoin needs to wear many hats for many people. And currently there are more pressing matters, like a fee estimation algorithm that doesn’t suck balls.

The global object `bitcoin` will give you access to all the methods contained in the library.
Edit: documentation on all the methods and objects is  you will just need to add `bitcoin.` before any of the main objects/methods they show in the examples.

Yes, but without segwit it would require another ugly "use NOP code as CHECK_NEW_ALGO_SIGVERIFY then use OP_DROP" type situation.

Normal addresses:
1. I paste my address on website.
2. Anyone can look it up and see all my transactions.
Stealth addresses:
1. I paste my stealth address on website.
2. No one from the outside can look up any transactions without being told a specific transaction ID, and even if they knew the ID... they have no proof that the address sent to was generated using MY stealth address (as compared to someone elses).
3. HOWEVER. People who send money to the stealth address hold irrevocable proof that they generated the send to address using your stealth address. They could leak this... but it would only leak info about 1 transaction. Why? because if Alice and Bob both sent Charles money to his stealth address, Alice and Bob are generating separate addresses, so Alice doesn't know about Bob's transaction to Charles, and Bob doesn't know about Alice's transaction to Charles.
Stealth addresses have a misleading name.
You are only stealthing yourself from those who do not send you bitcoins.

Except not really. The ideas behind segwit were being discussed with no name long before HK. It was in response BIP62 being a game of whack-a-mole that everyone gave up on and concluded: "ok, the only way is to just remove the scriptSig entirely from the txid hash..."
Sipa wrote it up and finalized it... but it was discussed thoroughly on IRC and mailing list under the guise of BIP62.

I found bitcoin because a clerical error almost got me arrested, but even though that was luckily an "almost," the government decided to steal all the money in all bank accounts with my name on it AND put a freeze on all accounts (so my payday was stolen too) until "matters were resolved"...
I was treated like a criminal, and the guy who made the paperwork mistake that hurt me never apologized. The state never apologized. When I got notarized documentation PROVING they were wrong, they replied coldly... "Please, wait..." "upon reviewing your case, we have removed the stop on all your accounts and will return your money upon resolution of the stop."

Yup, miners will just willy nilly accept all transactions into blocks and kill the utility of their income stream, thus losing them money.
Given the freedom, economic incentive would say that miners would set a soft limit or somehow otherwise screen transactions for "spam"-like features (yknow, like they do already?)
No serious miner would just blindly stick all spam transactions into one giant block.
Even if a malicious miner were to make a huge spam block, they would be limited by the current maximum size of p2p messages on the protocol, 32MB, and their miners would leave that pool in flocks.
When there were a handful of people mining individually on CPUs the malicious miner making big block attack was a possibility, but that possibility is now nearing zero, and fast.

The "flag" for RBF is just "nSequence value is not the max value of 0xffffffff"
So if you sent it with 0x00000000, then replaced with a higher fee and used all 0xffffffff, then the second transaction would no longer be able to be replaced, however, as long as you keep the value below that, it can be replaced.

You can't send a CLTV transaction to a payment processor unless they explicitly create the P2SH address that contains that scriptPubkey.
A bare CLTV output that would only be unlocked by the owner of the address would be non-standard, so it wouldn't propagate, and the payment processor would not recognize that output as pointing to them. (payment processors are looking for outputs that are OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;Their address's hash160&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG and any other scriptPubkey, even if using the same hash160, would not be picked up by them to begin with.)

For multisig wallets you need at least one JSON backup to ensure that you can create your wallet on any BWS server in case Copay ever shits down their official server.
But I'm assuming OP's PC is only one of the many keys, in which case, it can be restored with just the mnemonic.
I guess this warning is more for super paranoid people who have lots of money on the wallet... and technically, you could ask someone like me to generate the addresses for you / make a tool if worse comes to worse.

I find the best way to compare is to send half of your needed money via normal (SWIFT) transfer and half via bitcoin.
I did so recently with $3,000 split into $1,500 chunks.
The final amount of yen arriving to my account was $90 more with the bitcoin route ($90 worth of yen according to google)
Bank of America to SWIFT to MUFJ bank in Japan (yen exchange was performed by Bank of America with their rates automatically, and was the biggest hit)
Bitcoin was BofA to Circle, bitbanktrade.jp to MUFJ.
I put bitcoins in my bbt account ahead of time to make sure there were no huge market fluctuations while the funds were in bitcoin, so Circle to Trezor, Trezor to bbt.
It works for me, but experience will vary with different exchanges and banks.

I send out a transaction with nSequence = 0xffffffff, and code my wallet software to warn me when an incoming transaction is anything but 0xffffffff.
How am I affected?
I'm not.
Anyone trying to use this feature (in the current Bitcoin Core implementation) has to write "HEY EVERYBODY I'M USING RBF FOR THIS PARTICULAR TRANSACTION!" smack dab on their transaction.
There is nothing stopping every miner from supporting RBF and keeping quiet about it, and there would be no way to shame them or have recourse.
At least with this implementation, it requires you to opt-in on a per-transaction basis with a big red sticker announcing your intent to the world.
If you want to keep RBF down, the next place to campaign against would be "shame any wallet that allows the user to generate transactions with nSequence other than 0xffffffff".
But either way, I think all wallets must now spend many man hours to implement ways to show the user if the transactions they receive are RBF ok or not.

1. Banks with large amounts of bitcoin will lend you the bitcoin with interest. You pay them back with interest, if someone doesn't pay back, then the bank takes the hit. If they take enough hits they fail. Maybe you should ask your friends why they think banks shouldn't fail?
2. Bitcoin will be adopted where it is most needed first. You talk about "less developed countries" when most of Kenya's GDP is represented by a fully digital currency sent between cell phones. I think the "more technologically advanced" countries will be the last to adopt Bitcoin in any large way.

1. CALM DOWN. As long as you have your seed, your coins are fine.
2. If you have your seed, let me suggest that you backup your wallet file to a USB or something, then delete the wallet file from your PC, then restore your seed from scratch when it asks you to create a new wallet.
Once you've done  let me know how it went.
Missing Inputs means that the transaction you are trying to send is referencing an output that no longer exists. (This problem was prevalent during the transaction malleability mayhem after gox... but it has died down to almost nothing... so I doubt that is it.)
if you can send me any info your comfortable with (pm me) I can maybe give you more insight.

To do this, you should add an extra output going to an address you control. This is your "change" for the transaction.
5. Make sure the "Transaction Fee" is a reasonable amount by lowering your "change" amount. If you don't know what a ballpark for a reasonable Transaction Fee is... you really shouldn't be messing around with this...
6. Click submit to get an unsigned transaction in a long hex textbox. Copy this somewhere and note that it is unsigned.
7.  Go here, paste your WIF private key in the private key area, then the unsigned transaction in the larger textbox.

You can use a Trezor on a virus infected computer, and none of your private keys will leak. If you plugged your USB in and performed a transaction on a virus ridden computer using your setup, it would be MUCH easier to steal your private keys.
The biggest advantage is that the signature calculation is being performed on a closed off separated device that restricts the types of commands that can be interpreted by the CPU on the device.
To put it in simple terms:
1. Trezor's setup is like carrying a 50 ton reinforced steel room with anti-tank rifle resistant doors around with you so that you can sign contracts in there without anyone snooping on you.
2. Your setup is like carrying your special signature gear in a super awesome briefcase and every time you need to use it, you have to take your stuff out of the briefcase... so you better hope you're not signing it in a bad part of town.

Thought experiment:
Since Ethereum's sole purpose currently is speculation, as soon as a split seemed possible via miner disagreement, there were exchanges willing to capitalize on that and support both forks, allowing the economy to split freely as well.
What if all exchanges had refused to support ETC from the beginning?
The sole use would not be possible on the ETC chain, and after a while of futile mining, the miners would have noticed there was no way to use the ETC coins, and given up.
However, in Bitcoin's case, there are many players that the miners can not turn against for fear of mining an irrelevant chain. Of course, exchanges, also merchants, payment processors, second layer protocols (Counterparty, etc.) etc.
Some players are more important than others, but you can even tell that BU knows this, as they have been pitching BU to exchanges and the like. (Coinbase etc)
If miners fork off with BU and all the economic players are on Core, miners WILL lose money.

It's a good idea, but just know that IF YOU LOSE YOUR 13 WORD PHRASE, YOU LOSE YOUR BITCOIN.
Also, even if you use Tails, if you connect to the internet with Tails, you can't really call it "Cold Storage."
You could have downloaded a virus ridden version of Tails (assuming you're not checking the digital signatures) that sends the Electrum seeds back to home base upon creation. Or even worse, someone hacked your motherboard to send back any info that runs through your CPU back to home base.
1. Unplug all internet, if you have a Wireless card in your PC, disable it from the BIOS menu.
2. Boot Tails
3. Create new wallet Electrum
4. WRITE DOWN THE PHRASE. DOUBLE CHECK YOUR SPELLING.
5. When it asks you to write the phrase DON'T COPY PASTE. TRY TYPING IN YOUR PHRASE FROM READING WHAT YOU WROTE DOWN. (In this day and age, SO MANY PEOPLE write like chicken scratch and can't read their own writing.)
6. Copy down the first receiving address, or scan the QR with your phone or whatever to save the first address somewhere. (in fact, maybe write down the first 5 letters and last five letters on the same paper as your phrase just so you can verify later)
7. Send the bitcoin to that address.
Then when you want to spend those bitcoins, you can do that over, cept "Restore Wallet" and type in your phrase to sign the transactions.
If you want to manage your funds online (aka have a watch-only wallet online, and just keep the signing keys offline) you can copy the "Master Public Key" from your Tails Electrum to a text file and save that text file to a separate USB stick, then copy that Master Public Key into the "Restore wallet" of your online Electrum. That will allow you to deposit bitcoin, but not spend. (you can't get your bitcoin hacked)

It's 8 bits of checksum, which means 1/256 random 24 word phrases will have a valid checksum.
Which means that even if you change just one word (let alone 12) you have a 1/256 chance of getting a correct phrase.
Each word is chosen from a 2048 (11 bits exactly) word list. 11*12 = 132 bits, then subtract the 8 bits of checksum (since essentially every word changed regardless of position is changing those 8 bits evenly) to get 124 bits of entropy assuming you are lucky enough to find only valid checksums on every try of your brute forcing. That is why I said 124 bits on only attempts at valid phrases and then 225/256 junk guesses that wouldn't require grinding through the pbkdf2 iterations.

CPFP would be trivial fork a wallet like Copay which polls your own bitcoind for info via BWS (open source) server...
However, as RBF would require re-signing, the user would need to be proactively checking and paying attention to their transaction and confirmation times. Sure, Mr. Bitcoin and his Crypto-buddies might do that and that'll be fine for them, but grandma will see "sent" on a screen and not realize until 4 days later when her product doesn't arrive that "uh oh, fee market quadrupled in the 3 minutes after you sent your tx and now you're stuck in limbo."
Lightning will solve most of the UX problems with on-chain txes, but if we just look at on-chain, payment processors proactively using CPFP to pull in low fee funds and prevent fraud will be much more user friendly.

Normal transaction: 5% chance of successfully double spending. Don't know if it will be double spent.
With RBF: 100% chance of successfully double spending. Don't know if it will be double spent. (the only thing you know by the RBF flag is that the chance of double spend rose to 100%)
So the only difference here is changing 5% (inb4 "eye cn double spnd now wif 100% probabiliti becuz I'm haxxor" stfu no you can't) to 100%.
So up until now, we had merchants who were comfortable with the risk associated with zero-conf that will now no longer be comfortable.
Mining pools were afraid to implement RBF because of the backlash from their miners / the assumed effect on price of Bitcoin (as its usability decreases significantly)... but now that it's in Core, I think a lot of miners can use that as a crutch and a place to point fingers if their miners start giving them lip about it.
RBF flag or not. RBF is a bad thing for Bitcoin without any viable solution for instant confirmation-level security.
The only thing RBF serves is companies like Greenaddress and Blockstream.

You could do 1 of 2 ways, I think.
1. Do it server side. Maybe once every 24 hours, just check that all utxos are not spent. If spent, add the transaction history to the user's account and flag them for a warning next startup.
2. Do it client side. This could maybe be enabled as something to be done at log in.
Maybe there's no logical attack for this... if the attacker had all the keys needed, and was waiting for them to deposit a large sum before attacking... I guess they wouldn't try to syphon off small amounts as to not draw suspicion...

If they offer an offline signing app and that one guy screws it up similarly to the last time he screwed up, then publishing any transaction signed with that tool (even if completely offline when signed) would publish enough information for anyone to see it to recover your private key.
So yes, their operation security makes a huge difference with any tool they make.
I don't mind closed source, company ran centralized services. But if they fuck up at the magnitude they did, I'm out.

This is the PIN and the extra password, correct?
The password was incorrect.
With Trezor's password function, EVERY PASSWORD GIVES A VALID WALLET. There is no way to test whether the password you input is correct or not, so they just generate a wallet with that password.
If you put in the correct password your balance will show.

What that means is "the incentive structure must be based in such a way that it is more profitable to play nice than it is to cheat the system" and the only way to do this in any reliable way is with monetary incentive directly tied to the consensus algorithm.
You mention altcoins. These are all blockchains with their own "bitcoins" just under another name. Therefore they do not prove these banks right, in fact quite the opposite.
As far as twister and bitmessage are concerned, I am not sure how the incentive structure is designed to prevent cheating / alteration, but I can tell you that the ONLY reason they have not broken down (if they have no bitcoin-like token attached to the consensus algorithm) is because no one has attacked them yet.
I bet you if Edward Snowden started using Bitmessage (assuming it has no token of its own to incentivize consensus) their blockchain would break down under a huge attack real quick.

Not really.
Circle is the only place that does this, and expect to get the run around if you try to use anything over seas.
The reason being that at a technical level, credit cards and paypal are insecure, fraud ridden payment methods, and bitcoin is fraud proof.
Now, companies cover this up by setting up customer service and pushing the cost of fraud onto merchants, and bitcoin is still not well understood by many, and through their misunderstandings, can be defrauded with no recourse.
So from Circle's POV, you can understand why they are edgy when it comes to receiving fraud ridden payments in exchange for fraud proof payments they send out... They assume all the risk.
If Circle doesn't work out, you're out of luck.
Maybe try convincing the merchant to accept credit cards or something. (Though, I'm assuming that a bitcoin-only vendor probably already has decided why they don't want to accept other payments)

You are using blockchain.info as your webwallet.
The reason I know this is because blockchain.info is shit, and they calculated that your 0.35 BTC was left alone for almost 3 days, so it qualified your transaction for a "free transaction."
The problem is that the "free transaction" rules no longer exist. All miners have stopped using them. All transactions need fees now.
Please don't use blockchain.info as a wallet or a block explorer. They have proven time and again that they are not reliable.

Actually, mathematically speaking it is impossible to encrypt arbitrary data with EC. The reason why "encrypting the hash" (signing) works is because sha256 hashes are, for the most part, basically large integers that are less than the curve order.
The only way to use encryption with EC is to essentially use EC to perform a key exchange, then use that shared key to encrypt symmetrically using AES. This is called ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme)
So, for example, with pgp I can encrypt a message to you using your public key, and I don't need to have my own key pair to do that mathematically. That is true asymmetric encryption. However, with ECIES, I NEED a keypair and you NEED to know my public key in order to decrypt anything I encrypt. Not to mention, if I store the ciphertext and delete the plaintext, with ECIES I would be able to decrypt the ciphertext, which increases your security footprint. You not only have to worry about keeping your private key safe, but mine as well ;-) Those concerns are non-existent in true asymmetric encryption.
EC math can only deal with integers a tad smaller than 256 bits, which is why it's only good for signing.

I don't think you know how bitcoin works very well.
Even SPV wallets like breadwallet etc. will link payments to IP addresses, because as of late, it seems a large portion (maybe up to 1/5) of the nodes in the network are merely monitoring (and most likely, logging) information about the transactions and the network and refusing to help the network.
This is one of the reasons breadwallet has been acting up a lot before their last release. More nodes are refusing to relay transactions and just sitting there monitoring... receiving blocks and transactions, and occasionally giving out peer messages (when asked) that only send you to other peers that they control...
Anonymity is not just a feature you can slap on a piece of software (Your "anonymous wallet" statement assumes the wallet itself is inherently anonymous) it is a large list of steps you must follow everytime, all the time, and then, and only then, MAYBE you're anonymous... congrats...

Segwit is trying to solve malleability, and ECDSA signatures are only one source of malleability.
As long as there are parts of the transaction not hashed for signing, but hashed for txid, there will always be malleability.
Removing the ScriptSig from the txid hash is the only solution.

the obvious problem Bitcoin solves is the problem that no average person perceives as a problem yet.
People in the 90's weren't thinking "if only I had a gigantic wealth of information right at my fingertips!" seriously. Thinking / wishing something like that was seen as "crazy talk" or "science fiction" and therefore was not viewed as a "problem" by anyone. They were fine with going to libraries and looking up stuff in books.
In a similar way, people today don't think "if only there was a single world currency that could be stored securely in my DNA that can link across galaxies to relatives that live in other planets with instant verification and zero possibility of theft!" because that would be crazy talk.
Not to insinuate that will happen with Bitcoin, but my answer to your question is: "if you mean what I think is a problem for the average person, then I would say Bitcoin gives certainty of ownership of an asset that no one but you yourself can revoke, which is a solution to the problem of banks that lend themselves into pretend money-lands... however, if you mean obvious problems that the average person themselves PERCEIVE as a problem, NOW... then I would say none, but remind you that the greatest inventions are the ones that the average person doesn't know they need."

You can pay someone to watch for you.
Just make the punishing transaction send a part to the watching service, and they'll just sit there and watch everyone's punish transactions while you're asleep.
A wallet that comes online should check all the transactions it is watching when it comes back online.
A new form of bloom filter checking could allow this for SPV.
If you want to shutdown for more than the punish wait period, then you can offload the work to a service by sprinkling on a little trust into the mix (adding the fee reduces the trust needed a tad, as you have economic incentive on your side)

The average size of transactions is pretty large recently at around 500 bytes.
The 7 tx / sec calculation is based of the smallest transaction size of 250 bytes (ish)... so maybe 270,000 - 280,000 transactions per day would be the ceiling assuming people don't actively try to keep transaction sizes down and they continue at an average transaction size of current.

You're missing a highly technical step.
One private key can only generate one public key and two addresses (depending on whether the public key is compressed or not)
However, most wallets generate a MASTER private key which then generates a MASTER public key, from these two, individual private keys and public keys are generated procedurally, effectively giving you unlimited private keys from one secret. Another bonus being that you can generate public keys without the private keys. (ie the fourth public key generated from the MASTER public key will always be the public key of the private key generated fourth from the MASTER private key) This is how Hardware wallets are usually managed, as you usually don't need your PIN to check balances, because only the secret is encrypted on the device.
But for the most part, you're getting it

Store it physically.
Put a large enough amount that any thief couldn't resist in the no-password wallet, and put the rest in your password protected wallet.
If the money is stolen from the no-password wallet you know your phrase has been compromised, so you can do the following:
1. Migrate your remaining funds to a new phrase.
2. Evaluate where your phrases were and most likely to have been stolen.
The problem with storing in the cloud is that, when you get your honeypot stolen, it's hard to narrow down how it was stolen.
If you only have a copy in your home in a fireproof safe, the possibilities are limited in who the culprit is.
Also, don't go around posting your storage method on the internet.

let's say private keys are random numbers between 1 and 10. (or 0 and 9 if you want to be picky)
process to generate key.
Classic: 1. pick random number.
HD: 1. start with a random number as your first key. 2. for each consecutive key, take the previous key and multiply it by 6, then divide by 10 and take the remainder. That remainder is your next key.
Since the remainder of something divided by 10 is always less than 10, you'll always have a valid private key. Also, since the process at generating keys is known, as long as you can know the FIRST key, then you can know ALL the keys.
This is very useful for wallets that create new addresses for every transaction... because it helps privacy.
Edit: Nerd fact. My pseudo method is really shitty, because 6 would always generate 6. lol (6 x 6 = 36 / 10 = 3 remainder 6)... and 2... and 8... and 4... and 0... dang this method is really shitty for an example. lol

The problem is that paying out in Bitcoin doesn't matter. The IRS usually wants to see income tax documents in the country you're paid in. So unless your company it committing tax fraud in their own country (paying part of your wage in BTC and not reporting it) IRS will still catch you if you get audited.
I know of no country that says "if you get paid in gold bullion that's cool we don't need any taxes" or "if you get paid in foreign currency it's all cool, no tax!"
If there is one, I'd love to move there.

I once saw a 5 dollar bill on the ground in a bad area of town.
I thought it was prolly dirty with cocaine all over it, so I didn't pick it up.
If I was in a good part of town, my assumptions would have been different.
Anyone with the mistaken perception that all bitcoins are "dirty" and come from drug dealers might have the same idea. Or they might just think the points are meant to hook them into some scheme.
I find that when someone they truly respect sincerely tells them to look into Bitcoin and gives them more than $10 worth, they will accept it.

This is "change" (most likely. I'm assuming you're new to bitcoin)
In bitcoin, every transaction, unless you send all of your bitcoins (simplifying here a bit), sends the leftover change back to yourself.

I think this also stems from the audience.
A LOT of intellectuals view anything dealing with "finance" and "investment" as being a bunch of gambling cavemen with low IQs grunting at each other on the traderoom floor. (Whether or not that stereotype of "being above" the financial sector is correct or not, I don't judge. But a LOT of my "intellectual" friends are very condescending to my "investor" friends.)
If the first words out of his mouth were even a reasonable investment plan on bitcoin, then 99% of the audience would immediate label the video as a "useless pump, maybe even a paid advertisement."
Which is why i think he didn't use the exact phrasing of "We don't need bitcoin the currency." or "The currency is useless, but the technology behind it is useful!" etc.
I think he completely understands that the token of value can not be separated from the blockchain. He just can't hype that up too much, lest the "intellectuals" in his audience shun him.

This is true.
The bot looks for the mention of changetip in the message, trims all text that is not on the same line (paragraph) and then parses to look for monikers and units.
The units must be directly before the monikers and separated by a space, and after finding all mentions of any monikers, Changetip picks the LOWEST VALUE one.
So if I said "You are as brilliant as satoshi! 500 JPY u-ChangeTip" (I am not going to actually mention changetip) it will send 1 satoshi, not 500 JPY.

I believe the trope is "blockchains *don't need a token*." which is false, but Brad is basically saying "I'm not saying you should invest in it." which is not the same as "I believe that bitcoin as a unit is irrelevant to the blockchain itself as a mechanism."
If he started the talk with "BUY BITCOIN NOW EVERYONE TO THE MOOOOON!!!" he would lose credibility, and I think the first part was merely to say "I am not saying you should invest in bitcoin, let's set that aside for a moment and just talk about how Bitcoin innovates the finanical industry the same way the internet innovated the communications industry."

You cut costs.
No businessman in the world would pay upfront costs out the buttload just to throw everything away at the first sign of profit loss.
No business is perfect, and there is always a way to cut costs.
Not to mention that the mining difficulty also adjusts to meet the market, so for all you know your losses are -$200, but if everyone else is at -$500 (ignoring the fact that some businesses can hold out for longer on bigger losses), it would be smarter to stick it out until difficulty decreases from the other guys quitting.

Yeah. Ethereum doesn't need to be decentralized though, as their business model relies on hard forking every time some deep pocketed investor from their ICO or some government puts pressure on them.
Pop up a few astroturf sock puppets, and a few days later "consensus in the community" for a hard fork is born.
People who say the ETC/ETH market cap comparison is telling anything forget that market cap only has to do with all those investors, so no wonder they'd support the chain where they get their money back.
I don't think this is a problem though, as Ethereum pretty much requires large datacenters to scale their worldwide computer concept, even with sharding.
Currently 15 OPs per second. After switch to POS and sharding and getting rid of the pesky home grown nodes, they could probably do much more.

The xpub that exports is m/44h/0h/0h, so when he plugs in the xpub into a program to generate the keys, he must use m/0/0 to complete the remainder of the path to his keys.

Bank withdrawals are not all equally instant.
True story: balance $30, buy something $25 dollars, notice balance is low on bank app, deposit $100 to ATM, notice $105 on bank app, buy $50 thing. Should have $55 left over for the day.
Statement comes month later, transactions reordered to - $50 - $30 (od charge) - $25 - $30 (od charge) + $100.
That day ended up with a balance of -$5 for the day.
The app checking and micro management does not matter when clearing takes days, and banks reorder transactions at time of clearing to maximize fees.

Well, to be honest, you are a very very small minority. So I would recommend submitting a detailed bug report on the Copay issues page on github.
Just out of curiosity, how many utxos did you have in your wallet when it started giving you trouble? How many inputs were you including in the transactions that timed out? On average how large are the utxos (bitcoin amount)?
Etc etc.
This information would be immensely useful, and help push Copay forward (which tbh, Copay has scaling issues, but it's the most far along in the open source community for its usability and feature set) so that future people like you don't have the same problem.

New versions will automatically do this for you, with one caveat.
You need to have been running bitcoind for a specific number of blocks before it can accurately guage the fees.
Basically what it does, is it marks down when each transaction was first received, then when the block containing that transaction was received (and how many blocks were received in between) and calculates the fee per byte of that transaction. It does this for all (or a large sample... I forget) transactions to get some average estimates of "ok, 0.0000005 BTC per byte, for example. Then it looks to see on average how long those transactions took to get into a block. ie. "most transactions with 30 satoshis per byte transaction were confirmed within 2 blocks (meaning after receiving the transaction there was one block received, then the second block finally contained that transaction.)"
It uses this data to auto-adjust fees in bitcoind. But every time you shut off I believe it resets. I am not sure how fees work when the estimatefee can't return values.
If you want to manually adjust, here's a nice API to tell you the current network fees.
The numbers are in "satoshis per byte" so right now it says 50 for fastestFee... so 50 satoshis per byte with an average 259 byte transaction would be 0.0001295 BTC fee to get confirmed in the next block (estimated)

No. This is irrelevant. The BIP32 path relative to the xpub given by Electrum is the same as the relative path given by BIP44 wallets.
If blockchain.info's xpub balance detecor is not showing his balance like he said, that means probably his funds are in an address over the BIP44 default gap limit of 20. Electrum also uses default 20 gap limit.

@_date: 2017-05-24 01:00:51
There is a fee ceiling that is hard coded in Electrum.
Since CPFP is essentially creating a transaction with its own fees + the lacking fees of all unconfirmed parents, there is a high chance that your CPFP transaction will go over the fee ceiling (meant to prevent people from butterfinger sending a 20 BTC fee or something.
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:55:19
I would assume that if the dev team added lower decimal points, this would become a point of debate if the mining reward is still significant...
However, if the block reward becomes 99% transaction fees and 1% coinbase (not the company) then coinbase block rewards will be insignificant and the devs could really go either way. (let it continue to taper off, or just decide to stop the reward after the block it was supposed to stop at.)

How? Give a concrete example. Stating something does not make it fact.
How large would your identifier be per unit? What is the max number of units in the system?
In my example, I made the data as small as possible (to the point of not being able to track every unit in the system) and we still have 2.1 petabytes total at the end just to store every possible name of coin. In reality, you would need at least 8 bytes for each name, which would 8x the whole thing (Unless you used varint or some other variable length storage, which would be between the 1x and 8x that I gave)
I also ignored the fact that in order to track it, you need to specify where each satoshi is going in each transaction, otherwise there is no point in making the naming system. Sending 0.0001 BTC would require a minimum of 10 kB (one byte per name) and maximum of 80+kB (more depending on the contents of the transaction.
Right now average transaction size is in the 100s of bytes range... suddenly 10 - 10000 kB transactions would be the norm, as you need to specify each satoshi and where it goes.

Wait for confirmations.
Funds sent through LN are as good as BTC in a block.
If I am sending 1B dollars of value, sure, LN will be difficult, so on-chain is good for me. Even if fees go up to $500 per transaction it's  pocket change compared to $1,000,000,000.
This is one reason why I think that Lightning Network will have most people locking most of their funds with larger hubs in a single or multiple (3 or 4 depending on how many hubs pop up) hub based channels, this way there will (almost) always be a route from you to whoever you send, so in your example, I could send my money to A who would be connected to C somehow (how many hops, I'd have to query the route to check).
Your assumptions are leaving out the whole "Network" part of the Lightning Network.

An address is 20 bytes of data with one header byte and 4 checksum bytes attached that is base58check encoded.
In order to obtain the 20 bytes part, an ecdsa public key is hashed.
However, as a hash is psuedorandom, there is no 100% guarantee that every single possible combination of 20 bytes is represented when you actually do the impossible and hash every possible public key.
If I hash some random data, there's a 1/2 chance that the first bit of the hash is 1. However, it is possible that I might hash 20 random different pieces of data and all 20 hashes start with 1 and not 0.
It's insanely unlikely, but the chance is not zero.
In the same way, there is an infinitely unlikely, non-zero possibility that after hashing every possible public key, that some of the possible combinations of 20 bytes are not represented in those results.
But in practice, we can (very safely) assume all 20 byte combinations are represented in the data set.
However, the possibility is not zero is what I am saying.

tl;dr you are not the first person to think of doing this. It is very common in day trading circles. The fact that the arbitrage traders have not been able to equalize the markets of EUR and KRW either means that the KRW/BTC market is so fast to shoot up that the arbitrage traders can't keep up (due to slowness of fiat bank transfers in their arbitrage cycle, most likely) ORRRR there's a trap somewhere that every arbitrage trader has hit, preventing them to trade.

To be honest. A lot of people just want to "set it and forget it" with 90% of the things in their lives.
That's why most people who have enough money just set up auto-billing with their bank for their credit cards, and they use that same card forever.
The only way they switch cards or get new cards is if someone says "hey, I'll give you free stuff if you use OUR card." and even then some people feel that the free stuff (rewards) is not enough incentive to sign up for the extra card, even if it would be the most economically logical thing.
If Bitcoin wants mainstream adoption, it needs to either:
1. Become a required item for something that EVERYONE wants to use. **OR**
2. Have a reward for a large population of individuals that is worth more to them than the perceived effort of learning how to use it.
Which means we can either:
1. Create some amazing bitcoin-only thing that everyone will want to use. (IoT??? Brave-style in-browser micropayments???... maybe) OR
2. Bitpay or Coinbase or someone else needs to start a rewards system of some sort... OR
3. The condition of those people must get so bad that Bitcoin shows enough value to push them to overcome the perceived difficulty of learning to use it... OR
4. Make Bitcoin easier to use, and spread the word that Bitcoin is easy to use. (not necessarily evangelize, but mention "my 5 year old just set up his first bitcoin wallet and paid for a game with the bitcoin I gave him." etc. so people will perceive bitcoins as "easy to use."

Copay, but the UI kind of took a turn for the worse recently, so maybe breadwallet (but be prepared for long sync times every time you open the app for the first time in a few days, and the app not working on some wifi networks (with firewalls that block port 8333) )

You don't, and Yes. Cold storage can only stay cold by staying offline. If you have an automated methodology of signing the transactions offline, then it is assumed the automation is instigated by an online computer... and thus makes the offline computer vulnerable.


This really varies from service to service, and tbh this is where "security through obfuscation" tends to be the rule of the lam. I have heard of a few setups before, and I won't get into details, but storing the encrypted master private key on one server which is accessible through a specific user, which signs the transactions, then sends them back to a separate server for broadcasting / dealing with the user.
Key storage for businesses is something they want to keep a secret, as knowing their setup opens them up to sophisticated attacks. Not only on their servers, but in person (Mission Impossible style)
@_date: 2015-10-28 00:06:21
Very true.
It has been proven that models where you allocated x points per month and each action takes x/100 points sell worse than charging a set monthly price and making the cost per action relatively the same based on average user behavior.
The former is a "gasoline" mindset. ie "I only have this much left, gotta make it last" Whereas the latter is an "all you can eat" mindset ie. "I have to get my money's worth" (and most people don't have the appetite to)
The only way content providers will change to the former is if the public overwhelmingly demands it, as the latter is better for *most* businesses.
@_date: 2016-05-25 09:15:02
This is the answer.
@_date: 2015-03-28 02:03:13
It doesn't.
You place multiple addresses in the array to denote to the chain API that you want to send to a multisig address generated by the pubkeys of n number of specific addresses.
Chain can only do this if chain manages the addresses in question though, as you need the public keys, not the addresses, to generate the multisig.
Or maybe it accepts a list of pubkeys in the address array. idk

Because EC multiplication is just an extrapolation of EC addition which is a made up construct which has no "subtract" function.
In the same way, you can not, for instance find a factor of a point using their addition method.
Also note that you can not multiply points with each other, only multiply a point by an integer.
It is because of the fact that these are made up constructs that they do not retain all properties of addition and multiplication.
I personally think calling them such helps people conceptualize their relationship, but also introduces confusion when people try to extrapolate their own conjectures based on preconceived notions of how addition and multiplication works.

Use Copay on Chrome to set up a 2 of 2 multisig with one Trezor and One Ledger HW.1.
Now you need Trezor AND Ledger (competitors) to
1. Be lying and signing malicious firmware. 
2. Cooperate with each other to even realize that there is any money. (Trezor would need to ask Ledger "Hey, I think you have all your customers' public keys, can I have them so we can check if any of them made multisig wallets with both of our devices?")
3. Cooperate with each other to spend the money.
4. Do all this without any good-hearted employees realizing.
5. Spend the money without the person owning the money realizing.
Hardware wallet multisig is one of the best methods for cold storage IMO.

My mother and elder brother both work in the current financial system, and when they found out that I have recently been active in Bitcoin related development and running educational hackathon/teaching sessions in Japan for free, I get awkward deflections/one word acknowledgements about my accomplishments.
My dad is the only one who seems genuinely interested about my work.
One comment that kinda hurt me a little (though in general I don't really care about what my family thinks of me.) was when my brother explained on my behalf "yeah, it's like the modern, money equivalent of Betamax."
I was like... damn... how do you respond to that...
In all honesty, anyone would take my brother's opinion of financial matters over mine, (it's his job, afterall) so I just sat there and laughed it off.

I think it's helpful, because the creator of the image is obviously equating (in their mind as a pretense) blockchain.info the wallet with bitcoin the currency as a whole.
If the author had been pretensed with breadwallet, it would have been different. Greenbits, again, different. Android Bitcoin wallet with NFC, again, different... so it is nice to make the differentiation that he is speaking of a specific wallet in his mind, and yet he portrays bitcoin as "every possible way of using bitcoin is limited to this small box I am telling you"
There are services that offer password recovery services like Coinbase, As well as one tap to pay wallets like breadwallet.

Install it on your phone (assuming you aren't jailbroken or rooting your phone)
Then back up the 12 words on a piece of paper and store it in a safe.
Then export the wallet file ticking "don't export private key" and import that into your desktop Copay.

Exactly, which is why I hope that:
1. No wallet defaults to enabling RBF.
2. All payment processors outright REJECT payment from RBF flagged transactions. Write a disclaimer on the payment page saying "If you use RBF, they will not count towards your payment, but we will keep your bitcoins if they confirm in our possession. If you accidentally use RBF, please respend to yourself, no refunds or returns of RBF marked funds."
Edit: Let me be clear that I can see RBF use cases for exchanges managing their hot wallets and stuff like that... it would suck if an important funding transaction moving internally got stuck in a spam attack, and for deposits they don't care, because most of them wait 3 confirms before considering anything final anyways.
However, that being said. In the "Bob paying for coffee from his mobile SPV wallet" scenario there is 0 practical use for RBF.

Because Apple doesn't sell the software (iOS etc.), but retains full ownership of the software, Apple must comply with all requests from the government to manage that software.

bitcoins themselves are not a file that sits on your computer.
If that were so, I could just look at the 1s and 0s that make up the file and copy it, you're right.
But bitcoins the currency are not data that reside on your computer, they are entries on a gigantic ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world.
Your wallet software and wallet file only store what are called "private keys". These private keys can be used with a one-way math formula to generate public keys. These public keys can be used with a one-way math formula to generate what are called "bitcoin addresses"
When I send 1 bitcoin to you, I am writing a message that says "I own 1 bitcoin which was given to me at transaction XYZ... and I send this 1 bitcoin to the owner of address 1ABC..." Then that message (known as a "transaction") is given a unique ID number and I sign that message using my private key and that message to generate a long string of numbers called a digital signature.
A third party can then take the transaction message I wrote, my signature, and my public key (which is embeded in the message) and verify that I own the private key associated with that public key WITHOUT actually telling them my private key.
Once this transaction message is seen by a large amount of the computers, it is (mostly) secure.
To get rid of that "(mostly)", a process called mining takes all the transactions it sees and lumps them into blocks. These blocks are then thrown into a function similar to a digital signature, BUT it is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more difficult to compute. And the difficulty increases the more people are trying to solve it. It adjusts itself so that 1 block is found roughly once every 10 minutes.
So. Your bitcoin wallet is going over the internet and asking one of those computers: "Hey, I have this address, 1ABC... are there any messages that are sending to me?" and the computer answers back to you "hey, you have 5 bitcoins sent TO you, 5 bitcoins sent FROM you, and 1 bitcoin sent TO you."
Your software adds that up to get a balance of 1 bitcoin.
bitcoins are not data on your computer, they are merely entries in a long chain of token ownership known as the blockchain.

Bc.i has more than one dev, sure. But their WALLET has uhhh...
one dev.
A very sporadic one at that. 30 million in funding and maybe 2-3 updates a month from one guy.
Granted. They are probably concentrating more on their apis than their wallet. But OP asked about the wallet, and I told OP about the horrible opsec that their wallet is built around.
I am no troll, but that incident not only made me shy away from blockchain.info's MyWallet, but I am very passionate about my disliking of their service for the sole fact that they can handle its development so poorly.
Seriously. The guy took entropy from a pool of 0 - 255... if he's the co-founder then I guess that's why he was not fired, but that mistake really loses all credibility for the MyWallet service.
Maybe I'd change my tune if I saw that there were tons of new faces making daily commits to try and maintain MyWallet and make sure the functionality was there and the security was there, and they were utilizing dev branches to perform tests before rolling out to production... but nope. Still the same one guy.
I think he copy-pasted the RFC6979 implementation from bitcoinjs-lib after that incident. I would be shocked if he tested it before rolling it out.
If this makes me a troll against bc.i, then whatever. I am just choosing to NOT overlook their glaring issues. If you want to give them a free pass, then go ahead.

Unless you have other addresses you're not telling about, I would just chalk it up to "4.3 was a display error and you only had 3.03 ish to begin with".

ECDSA can not encrypt. Only sign.
ECIES is an encryption scheme in Elliptic Curve Cryptography using symmetric keys generated by a diffie hellman exchange using two keypairs to create a shared secret.
If you're gonna do that anyways, just generate the address directly using the shared secret as the private key... then publish "1ABC... is the address from the diffie hellman of my private key with the public key 03f2ba21... and the public key of the genesis block address. I have sent 1 BTC. If Satoshi is out there, please move it."
Now, because you will know the private key as well, any on-lookers would probably think you moved it no matter what you said.
But yeah, you can't really encrypt something with the public key... you technically would have to perform DH on the public key with your private key to generate a shared secret, then either use that shared secret to encrypt a new private key, or just use that secreat as the secret private key and tell Satoshi publicly the address as well as your pubkey you used for the DH.

On your offline machine:
1. Click Wallet &gt; Master Public Key
2. Copy that down to a text file of some sort.
3. Transport that info to a computer thats online
On your online machine:
1. Start a new wallet with the online electrum, click Restore &gt; watch only wallet
2. Enter the master public key
How it works:
1. The master public key is a point on the elliptic curve which represents the public key of your master private key. This is then subsequentially added using EC math to a point derived from index info along with a unique code to the parent public key. Each child public key can then be regenerated independantly using the parent public key and that index information without the need or the private key. Because of the fact that you know the master private key and the index/code info alone means that you can be certain that the public keys being generated are retrievable from your master private key.

The blockchain knows 0 info about you. The ONLY thing it knows is whether a transaction was signed by the right private key or not.
Meaning, to the blockchain you = your private key.
If you set a limit verifying with a signature from your private key, a thief could just change it back because as far as the blockchain is concerned, you're him and he's you.
Also, if someone knew you had money and you set up a convulted system to prevent them from getting it. They'd probably not understand it and say "well, we know you have 1000000 BTC, so send it to this address within 24 hours or we'll shoot. you.
"But I can't!!!"

Want to receive? click the receive tab. Want to see all your addresses? click the address tab. Each tab has only a couple buttons. all wallets are a few clicks away.
Now, if Armory offered some inter-wallet ananlytics engine that showed pie charts and whatnot comparing balances of each wallet file over time... then maybe I could see the merit of showing all wallets all the time... but other than that, I like the Microsoft Office approach of 1.

On an offline computer:
- generate private key
- generate public key from private key
- generate Bitcoin address from public key.
On online computer:
-receive only the Bitcoin address from the offline computer through some other means (like QR code or USB memory)
-display the bitcoin address to the user.
You don't need the private key to RECEIVE bitcoin, you only need the private key to SEND bitcoin.
Cold storage RECEIVES bitcoin, and when you SEND from cold storage you can either 1. sign offline, which keeps cold storage cold, or 2. bring the cold storage online to sign, which makes it hot, so you must generate a new cold storage.

While this is true for receiving. It is not true for sending.
There have been many instances where a wallet had a horrible bug that leaked your private keys through your signature.
If you reuse addresses, this is an issue, as any funds left will be stolen by the first person to notice it.
If you are sending change to a new address every time, then the private key leaking only matters if they can notice before your transaction gets in the next block, OR if the attacker can somehow get a hold of your xpub (master public key).
But as long as you're using a not-shitty wallet that uses RFC6979 for signatures. You're good.

True. But tbh I think an open source solution where the company's entire business model relies on the security of their customer's bitcoins is slightly more trustworthy.
ie. A rouge SatoshiLabs employee somehow sneaking firmware into devices and stealing millions in BTC before getting caught would kill the company. Whereas a rouge Apple employee sneaking code into the OS to check for breadwallets and steal the keys from the enclave would definitely send shockwaves through the tech community... But Apple would not die, and millions of people would continue to use iPhones.
(This ignores the difference in the likelyhood that these backdoors would go unnoticed. I'm sure Apple has a bunch of security measures in tact for code control. Etc etc.)

Try sending bitcoin to one of your receiving addresses (if theres no bitcoin left on any receive addresses) then send a part of that to some other address (the goal is to get Mycelium to generate and use a change address). (Edit: do this all on your Mycelium app)
I think doing that once through the Mycelium app will kick start it into working. (I think it might reuse your change address though)

You're missing the point of how replace-by-fee works.
If you implement replace by fee, seeing a 200 BTC fee with the same inputs as an existing transaction in the memory pool FORCES you to destory the first and accept the second... then 2 seconds later if the same inputs had a 300BTC fee transaction, the 200BTC fee transaction would be DESTROYED (deleted from everyone's memory pool)
The thief wins if he even gets 1 satoshi from you, so all the way up to paying 100% minus 1 satoshi, the thief will fight you.
Thief: Sends 100% cold wallet funds minus 0.0001 BTC fee.
Bitstamp: Notices theft, sends 100% minus 100BTC fee
Thief: Notices 100BTC fee transaction. Sends 100%  minus 100.00000001 BTC and DESTROYS bitstamps transaction.
*this will continue untill 100% are in the fees... the whole time this bid war is going on, there is a 40-60% chance that the thief's transaction is the winner when the next block is found (Since you never know when a new block will be found)*
Posting on the net that "We have a scorched earth transaction waiting to be broadcasted in the event of theft." then a thief with the motive of "I want money." will give up attacking them.
This leaves the people who "just want to see xyz burn all their bitcoins." to which there could be other contingency plans... If you were one of the biggest exchanges like bitstamp you could approach each mining pool individually and let them know the transaction hash (without giving them the transaction, of course.) of the scorched earth transaction, and say "if you mine this, we will pay you x amount to return the remainder of the funds to us"
The mining pools wouldn't want the biggest exchange to go bankrupt, so most pools would individually cooperate (note the mining pools are not cooperating with each other) to return funds to the exchange in that event.

What index has a balance?
Electrum will search from index 0 and count upward (1,2,3,4...) until it finds 20 empty addresses. Then it will stop.
If your users are making a lot of requests, but not actually playing, then it is possible that your 0-19 addresses are all empty... which would mean Electrum can not find them.
To change this, open the "console" tab and type these two commands hitting Enter in between:
    &gt;&gt; wallet.storage.put('gap_limit', 50)
    &gt;&gt; wallet.storage.write()
50 will mean it searches for 50 empty addresses before giving up.
After running that you can check your gap limit with:
    &gt;&gt; wallet.storage.get('gap_limit')
I would recommend after running write(), you should close Electrum and open it again so it can refresh and query your addresses.
If you have a slow computer, any gap limit over 100 will cause your Electrum to be very slow.
You can check how many you need to increase the gap limit by checking your address on the Gateway settings page and looking for the number next to it and counting the number of unused addresses between the beginning and the address you want to see.

You have your seed. That is all the info you'll ever need.
If you want to turn it into an xprv, learn to code.
Asking wallets to implement confusing super advanced features will just make less technical users lose money.
Imagine a site asking for users to input their xpub. Then lets say you get your way an Electrum outputs xprv on demand along with the xpub you can get now.
Less technical user loses money by accidentally pasting his xprv into that service instead.
Are you willing to compensate that user?
If no, then the answer to making Electrum spit out xprvs on demand is "don't".

Well, you need to find something that makes your transaction invalid on one side. This can be anything and depends on what each side is validating.
ie. BU doesn't do RBF, so if you send a tx then immediately send another tx with 1 more satoshi in the fees using RBF, BU nodes will only see the first tx and Core nodes will see the second. This results in two transation IDs, which means your coins are "split"
Another way is dependent on one chain having more blocks than another. Send a transaction with a block based locktime saying ie. block 15 when only one chain is on 15 and the other is still on 12... your transaction will only be accepted by nodes on the chain at 15. etc.

0.0001 BTC on an average transaction (259 bytes) is 38 satoshis per byte.
To give perspective, 38 s/b would get you confirmed within 2 blocks during the peak of the worst stress test.
However, if you don't understand how bitcoin transactions and their fees work, there is a good chance you'll set a hard fee of 0.0001 BTC and one day unbeknownst to you, your transaction is 2300 bytes, and suddenly you're at 4 s/b and no miner wants to pick you up.
Unless you understand how to estimate transaction size accurately, please use a wallet that calculates dynamic fees for you. FUD aside, I don't want any more users posting "OMG I PUT 0.0001 BTC FEES BUT NO CONFIRM OMGOMG" (which most of the time is not FUD, but a misunderstanding of how bitcoin transactions work.

The line of argument for big blocks is as such:
1. The current network capacity is limited.
2. Therefore, in times of high usage, low value transactions are pushed out of relevance and are forced to pay huge (relative to value) fees or wait long periods of time compared to what is normal.
3. Everyone who uses Bitcoin wants more people to use bitcoin.
4. The instinct of someone who understands nothing of how the network behaves (not saying all big blockers are this) think simply "why not raise the block size?"
Now for a second, let's look at a similar thought process we can learn from:
1. Sometimes vaccines cause adverse side effects in small children.
2. Since Facebook and other social media, as well as search result bias (what percentage of results to the search "car crash" are going to be positive towards the idea of driving?) amplifies the effect of a very small minority, a large portion of parents can easily find horror stories of hurting children. They however can not find search results on the large amount of children who used to die of polio without having it seem so long ago that it feels to have no relevance.
3. Every parent wants their child to be healthy.
4. Their instinct is "if I don't give my kids vaccines, they can't have adverse side effects"
In both instances, you have a large group of scientists who understand their field saying, at the very least, "if we do recommend this, it is only after extremely rigorous testing... but since my professional opinion is against it, I will participate in no such testing."
Then you have the small minority of "industry professionals" that have extremely shady business ties and incentives. That then spread the fear and doubt against the scientific opinion of others.
Since real scientists use language like "there is no evidence linking x to y." And the other side uses language like "x causes y." Non-scientists take the former to mean "a ha! You're not certain!"
I digress.
The main argument against raising non-witness data limit in the block is that it requires a hard fork, and a hard fork is by definition a birthing of two currencies. We have a good example of a contentious hard fork with ETH and ETC, and I guarantee you that if a hardfork happens in Bitcoin, we will have two coins and both will end up having an extremely petty fight over which one will be called "Bitcoin."
The secondary argument (main for some) is that increasing the block size will, by definition, increase centralization.
I can already tell you from personal and anecdotal experience, Ethereum's blockchain and bandwidth requirement has been growing at such a rate that most of my friends who run a full node at home will likely stop doing so within the next few months.
Bitcoin is also brushing up against that limit, but considering we all use Bitcoin in our daily lives and businesses, we can justify those costs easier. All thanks to the current blocksize.
To be honest, I think SegWit should have stayed what it originally was intended for: fixing transaction malleability. It is because of the fact that the witness discount was added on after the fact that everyone on the big block side started attacking it. (Assuming its passing would kick the can down the road enough for "small blockers to continue stalling") All of these "tech debt" and "you can hard fork steal segwit funds" garbage is just extra cream on top of the bullshit sundae they feed to the non-technical crowd.
Segwit2MB is a misnomer. The Segwit data discount can effectively increase processed data (both bandwidth and storage) by 2x-4x for segwit transactions, and then 2x from blocksize raise. So a 4-8x increase in data requirements, plus we have proven the business model of "introduce FUD, get smart sounding people, maybe implant a figurehead (nice try, Craig), get the populous on board, and implement a change that increases your profit" is extremely viable.
I think a 2MB hardfork will happen. I think the legacy fork will split off. I think there will be some legal battle over Bitcoin's name (probably involving bitFlyer and whoever pays them off, they are the owner of the trademark). I think the 2MB hardfork, and whoever maintains it, will try to hardfork again rather quickly (within a year after the first) and include some "wishlist" points that a portion of the 2MB crowd will disagree with. Repeat ad nauseam.
Heck, 2MB might try to add perpetual miner reward to replace the fees they never want to exist. But that's just grand speculations on what a scarecrow of the big blocker would do, so that is not relevant right now.
I am not against increasing block data requirements, which is why I've made peace with SegWit's witness discount. However, I do not think a hard fork is good for any blockchain. (Unless it can cleanly break off, and the non-status-quo fork changes its ports, address parameters, and name. Like Feathercoin.)
I am definitely looking forward to drivechains, though. It would be a way for the big blockers to use a bitcoin backed "big block coin" which if it were a 1:1 exchange they could just call "bitcoin plus" or something positive sounding, and they wouldn't have to eat crow, and I won't have to validate their chain. They could remove the blocksize limit on their chain completely and I wouldn't care. My node in my closet will be happy and so will they.

99% of that comes from "difficulty of obtaining bitcoin"
My wife thinks Chrome is the name of "our internet" and yet she uses breadwallet without knowing anything at all about bitcoin.
Only difference is  I give her my bitcoins to use. And  the places she uses them all have experienced employees who know how to show the payment QR without fumbling around and accidentally confusing everyone.
She asks for the product, scans the QR, types in a PIN and is done. She sees the balance in both bits and JPY.
Now, if I asked her from 0 "don't ask why, but by 6PM you must obtain 0.1 bitcoin and send it to this BIP47874874 encrypted Public Key Address Hash Multisig account" then yeah, she'll be confused... but if I asked you to "make an HTTP GET request to the routing IP of google with the parameter q that is equal to the URL encoded value of "monkeys" and only show me the page if you get a 200 response." you would probably be like "what?" but I just basically asked you to google "monkeys" for me.

No. Since Bitcoin Cash have already stated they will not support segwit, and they will KEEP replay-ability of Bitcoin transactions, they are able to spend any and all Segwit outputs on their chain.
They can NOT steal your Bitcoin, but they CAN steal your Bitcoin Cash. And anyone, not just miners, can do it easily...
Your argument is a great one to use against the r/btc people saying "OMG MINERS CAN JUST REVERSE SEGWIT RULES AND STEAL LOLOLOL"
My statement is "Bitcoin Cash won't activate Segwit to begin with, and they are leaving replay attack open (only providing optional protection) so that many old hodlers who send to a segwit output will be giving away their Bitcoin Cash to the greedy Bitcoin Cash users.

To add to your review:
(I've already told this to Ben directly)
If you recover funds from the wallet on your own outside the wallet using the recovery tool, then continue to use the wallet as normal, the transactions that were performed out of the wallet are not shown on the transaction screen.
This lead to my transaction history always adding up to 1000 bits less than my balance. (the balance is correct, and the app doesn't try to spend inputs that don't exist anymore)
Fixing this might be more trouble than it's worth... but that means that if someone had their keys compromised, (aka the attacker stole the cold and hot keys and the ninki xpub) they could syphon off funds slowly, and the user would not notice the difference of their balance and transactions total. (especially if they do a lot of transactions)
The more I think about it, the more I think there should be some system in place to check for sent transactions not initiated in the Ninki app. I also think that the icon to represent the transaction on the screen should be something unusual, like a Ninki logo or something and maybe even alert the user to check whether the transaction was deliberate or not.

DJBunny has the correct answer.
- pass rescan = false to each call except for the last one.
By default, after every importprivkey, bitcoind spends a looooooong time rescanning the whole blockchain for balances (because of the new key added)
Rather than rescanning after every import, only rescan after the last one.
Should take a few minutes, so you'll have to wait a while.

They can't support BitcoinCash, because the index patches don't exist for BitcoinABC. If you're "stuck on one side" it would be the Bitcoin Core (/UASF/BIP91) side.
But you aren't really "stuck". You will always have access to your private keys. ie. With Copay your private keys are basically your 12 word recovery phrase.
Now that BitcoinCash has made the new sighash a standard rule, you will not inadvertently send BitcoinCash every time you send Bitcoin. BCC will be sitting, waiting for you to sign a transaction using the same keys you have now to sign the new transaction.
Calm down. You'll be fine.

No. You can send your money THROUGH that business to any other business on the network.


Yes. Which is why you won't make direct connections with Starbucks unless you use them frequently and want to save on fees. I could pay Starbucks without opening a channel with them directly, but I would have to route that payment through a couple other nodes before the payment arrives at Starbucks, and those nodes might take a small fee.

If I buy two model car kits at marked price and one pre-built model car at 75% off, how is it unfair that someone who buys 2 kits at 0% off and 10 pre-built model cars at 75% off is still paying more money total?
Currently the Bitcoin network makes it cheaper to increase the utxo set size than it is to decrease the utxo set size by a factor of 4.35. The witness discount makes that factor 0.92. Only SLIGHTLY adding an advantage to DECREASING the utxo set, but not to the point where sending to multiple recipients becomes an impossibility.
tbh, up until now Bitcoin inputs were "unfairly" expensive. Segwit finally fixes that bug.

Emphasis on TRY IT FIRST WITH A SMALL AMOUNT!
Pretend your doing the real thing, follow a tutorial or something.
Then, fund the address with 0.0001 BTC or so.
THEN TRY TO RECOVER THAT 0.0001 BTC AND SEND IT BACK TO YOUR OTHER WALLET.
Once you have done this enough times to feel comfortable with the process, and you have studied up on the method to see how safe it is, THEN restart the whole thing with a new key or new whatever it is you need. And this time move all your funds.
I highly recommend Electrum as well. Using a bootable Tails USB is best because it comes pre-installed with Electrum, and Tails (by design) does not store any information after shutdown, so you will have to type in your 12 word seed every time you want to sign a transaction.
Signing a transaction offline is a multi-step process, and takes a couple times to get used to. But I highly recommend it.
@_date: 2015-03-14 11:28:56
You can't.
The address is not the thing being compressed, the public key is. The "compressed" bit is just a flag in the WIF private key that tells the software to "please hash the compressed public key and not the uncompressed public key in order to get the proper bitcoin address"
You can not compress and uncompress addresses.
You will end up with a different address all together.
Now, if you want to decompress a WIF PRIVATE KEY. that's easy, but it will result in a different bitcoin address, so any funds sent to that address can not be redeemed with the converted WIF private key.

Notification transactions are a huge cost to the user, you essentially double your fees if you only ever send once.
Not to mention this gives the false impression that payment codes are safe to reuse because they rotate addresses... When in fact, the more relevant reason for not reusing addresses when sending is because the other person might have lost their key or had it compromised.
Until Payment codes can solve these two problems, I don't think they're ready for prime time yet...

How many times have you sent money into your Trezor and what is the average amount of money you deposit into your Trezor per transaction?
Currently, to get a fee of $248 you would need to have about 220 transactions being referred to when sending.
So if you receive a ton of small payments and you need to refer to 220 payments in order to send 1BTC, then that's actually a proper fee.
If you've only ever received bitcoin one time in the past and you're sending 1 BTC of it, then that's a broken wallet.
Bitcoin fees rise with data size, not sent amount size. The more transactions your transaction needs to refer to the more data it uses.

insight's transaction API (free) can look up 200 addresses in one call and return all unspent transactions sent to those addresses.
I'd just keep doing that occasionally. I think as long as you're not querying them every second or something you won't get rate limited out.
Also, you could create your own insight node and query that, it's open source.
Here's an example of a little site I made to sweep getgems old wallets.
addrlist and changelist have 20 addresses each. Though I remember during testing I was able to query much more.

This ticks me off.
You have a LOT of nerve to look at the development community in Bitcoin and say to their face "YOU'VE DONE NOTHING"
The first crypto-related protocol to create a distributed consensus? Bitcoin.
The first crypto-related protocol to adopt multi-key signing verification methods? Bitcoin.
The first crypto-related protocol to be used in distributed secret generation and distributed signature protocols? Bitcoin.
If vendors refuse to USE THESE TOOLS THAT PEOPLE MADE FOR THEM FOR FREE, then users should STOP USING THOSE VENDORS.
I propose that as a community we STOP using exchanges that do not subject themselves to regular cryptographical audits and use secure multi-sig signing methodology to manage funds.
Proposing a stupid idea (coin blacklisting) is one thing, but spitting in the face of EVERY SINGLE Bitcoin dev and saying "YOU'VE DONE NOTHING" is despicable.

Core's "feelings"????
That is the most patronizing comment I have seen.
If anything Core has done nothing but express their professional opinions on the matter and refuse to develop solutions which they feel to be insufficient.
Such inaction is perceived as an active prevention of blocksize increase, but this is not true and only seems that way because Bitcoin requires a standard of code quality that currently none of the blocksize increase repos can deliver. Also, inaction is extremely advantageous to the status quo. This is a feature of Bitcoin. If two guys in a garage coding a fork to add perpetual miner rewards could be forced upon the network by just spending a few million on astroturfing the "movement", Bitcoin would be worthless.
I am all for a 2 MB hard fork. But 3 months to roll it out is insane. Also, the current proposals on the table to hand over the ruleset to the miners in a dynamic manner are all dangerously removing that property of Bitcoin which I think we should value more. The resistance at a protocol level to change.
Miners play a vital role, yes. But this 2 year long debate has proven that they are not the Gods of Bitcoin. They push the chain forward for us, and in return they get paid well. When there is unparalleled support for Segwit among businesses and users alike, they should not throw a hissy fit and block well coded and critiqued protocol upgrades.
If anyone's "feelings" are making me sick and tired, it's the miners' feelings.
If Core's well thought out professional opinions rub you the wrong way, make an alternative client that doesn't crash every other week.

If your computer has ever been online. There is a non-zero possibility you accidentally got a virus from some website that does nothing but sit there and wait until you deposit more then 0.05 BTC into your Electrum wallet, then sends your recovery phrase to some guy in China and lets him steal your wallet.
You can't prove to me that such a virus DOESN'T exist, so therefore some people prefer to generate their keys on a computer that was never and will never be online, then export the master public key only, to import into their online computer... then they create the transaction on their online computer, carry the unsigned transaction to their offline-forever machine, sign it using that machine, then carry the signed transaction back to the online wallet to double check it then broadcast it to the bitcoin network.
These people are people like me. My setup is a liiiittle more complicated though.

With segwit, the hash used as the message during ECDSA signing is essentially the txid itself... which makes your "feature" even stronger based on the uses you expect of it.
Before segwit, the whole reason malleability happened was because "I am signing data X" but the txid was "I am hashing data Y" but now txid hashing data and the ECDSA signing data are one in the same. These signatures are hashed into a merkle tree which the root is contained in the coinbase transaction, and must be verified otherwise other miners will invalidate your block if you build on a block with an invalid witness.

If BIP148 continued on to a point where legacy was &gt;4032 blocks long and UASF was long enough (4032 plus some change) to lock in and activate segwit...
1. miners would already fork off legacy to protect from a 4000 block reorg.
2. miners would have already joined UASF to prevent a 4000 block reorg-possible scenario to begin with.
In which case, the UASF developers would not be responsible for any loss.
UAHF is definitely going to happen. There are no game theoretical assumptions at play here: It's simple. Here we made a spec, we start forking here, and have a nice day, good bye, the end.
One thing that is telling of these HF projects is the way they make childish additions to the source code and their protocols that have no logical reason besides to belittle the people whom they disagree with.

Here's my 2 bits: (I'll start each reply with a 1 word reply-ish thing)
1. **N/A**. I'm an iPhone 5 guy, so I have no clue what you guys are talking about :-P I'll take your word for it. This should be reported on github.
2. **YES!** This should also be fixed. Notifications are only useful if they show up whenever. (Even when the device's screen is turned off)
3. **NEUTRAL.** This is rather subjective, but I wouldn't mind it being longer too.
4. **YES!** I agree a sound would be nice. I assume you're talking about in-app. If you were outside of the app and No. 2 was fixed, the normal iOS notification sound will play, so that's sufficient. In-app could use to have a small sound playing when a new payment is received / the payment is successfully sent.
5. **NO.** I disagree on this one. I think more apps should disallow BTC amount showing to help fight unit bias. Also, since the "Bitcoin" network and "bitcoin" currency confusion is already a big problem, why not change the currency to just be "bits" and kill two birds with one stone. "but but but, bits is already used!!!" well, pounds can mean a currency or a unit of measurement, as well as "dollars" being used to represent MANY countries' currencies... I see no valid argument against it except "It's the way it's always been." which holds no water imho.
6. **YES!** There's no need to generate 24 word phrases, but since many places do, I agree with supporting restoration of 24 words. However, secp256k1 only offers 128 bits of security, so don't trick yourself into thinking you're 256 bits safe. You can google  (check the comparable key sizes in the Introduction) ECC = Bitcoin, Symmetric = actual 1bit to 1bit security)
7. **NO.** I would like this, but unfortunately it would clutter the UI and give newbies room for making huge errors. Aaron is very vocal about keeping things SUPER simple, so there are a bunch of algorithms to check what the appropriate fee is... for the most part it's very close to the minimum 10 bits.
8. **YES!** I have suggested this before on github. Popping up a message to the user telling them they don't have enough to cover the fee and ask "is it ok to lower the send amount to accommodate the fee?" and show the new send amount and the fee amount. Definitely should go on github.
9. **NO.** I'm not a fan of the red/green color scheme. Plus this app is not made for "the type of people who would know what 'looks professional' for an investment app." This app should have a slick UI like an apple product and remove any and all distractions from the core functionality.
10. **YES!**
11. **MAYBE.** Depends on how this setting can be easily relayed without confusing the user. Remember, you are a pro at using apps compared to the audience for this app.
12. **YES!** This is a must.
13. **N/A** I'll take your word.
14. **MAYBE.** It depends on whether they clutter up the UI or make it confusing. If you have any write ups or mock sketches on how the screen might look, upload them to a github comment in an issue.
15. **KINDA YES.** I think this notification should be popped up when trying to copy an address from the transaction history. That way people who are being forced to send to the same address twice are not bothered. (copying from transaction history is a clear sign that the user doesn't understand bitcoin well enough, and must be told something)
16. **NEUTRAL.** I don't think so... but either way, we're not at a point where manually typing in satoshis is something we do every day, so maybe low priority.
17. **YES!**
18. **NEUTRAL LEANING ON NO.** Just keep in mind we are aiming for a grandma audience, not an investment banker wall street tech savvy bitcoin enthusiast audience. I would be interested in seeing any studies you know of showing this data.
Thanks for the feedback, I'll try to go through and put them up on github later if you don't beat me to it.

You have a warped view of how sandboxed apps work.
Sarutobi can't edit other apps, because if Sarutobi tried to do something under the assumption the device was jailbroken, it would break Apple rules.
Attempting harmless code just to check if the device is jailbroken is allowed though.
Jailbreaking's "jail" refers to the sandbox, and while official apps are not allowed to utilize jailbroken privileges, jailbroken apps are allowed to do anything they want.
If you jailbreak, all sandboxes are gone, and apps that are official will continue chugging along as if there was a sandbox there.
sandboxes are not imposed by the app, they are imposed by the hardware and the OS. Jailbreaking "breaks" the sandbox ability.

BIP39 is a method for encoding 128 - 256 bits of random data into 12 - 24 word phrases from interchangeable 2048 word lists, and then how to turn those phrases into a 64 byte hash.
BIP32 is a method for generating a tree of private keys from a root master private key.
BIP44 is a method for structuring a private key tree in a specific way that will facilitate usage/restoration/discovery of multiple accounts for multiple purposes.

1. Micropayments are more useful with incremental payments in a "fuel"-like state. ie. "We offer bandwidth at 0.0000001 dollars per kilobyte" and they calculate up to a point of settlement ie. "we close the micropayment channel every day at noon GMT." and then publish the transaction with the amounts returning to the sender and recipient reflecting the amount of value exchanged. The use case of "buying a one-off product for 0.000000000000000000000001 cent" is not realistic.

legacy is 12 words
The problem stems from an argument about BIP39.
You will probably notice that BIP39 seems contradictory in that is states "the phrase does not rely on the wordlist, as the phrase is hashed." And yet "the checksum relies on the wordlist to find indices for each word"
Thomas told them to make the checksum independent of the wordlist by instead brute forcing the 4 bits or so until they happen to work out to the checksum of the previous bits.
This is what Electrum's version of BIP39 does.
I think it's a shame that every BIP39 implementation doesn't just hash the phrase and give a cautionary pop up if the phrase checksum doesn't match or the wordlist isn't recognized.
They all refuse to generate the seed if there's unrecognized words or if the checksum doesn't match.
BIP39 is great, but it's lacking.
If you want to fork Electrum then go for it.

I think it will be difficult to implement without a third party to handle the transactions for them.
Imagine if your smartphone died and all of the flash storage was destroyed somehow in the middle of a session... If the transaction exchanges (nLockTime etc) were all being handled locally and there were no cloud backups of those signed transactions (the ones that you don't want to send to the bitcoin network yet) then it could break the system.
When a credit card terminal breaks, the merchant doesn't accidentally receive partial notary privileges on a large portion of your funds in your bank account. (which is what would happen with a fully-local-only Lightning implementation and your smartphone broke.)
But again, in implementation they might have some trustless way of doing this, like encrypting the signed transactions and storing them on bitcoin nodes or something... (though I highly doubt that would happen)

It's for technical reasons.
The fork detection they implemented to prevent confusion during a UASF scenario is easy to detect and implement. The transactions and blocks are the same except for a flag in the block version.
Fork support of BCC requires developing a brand new way to sign transaction data per spec, and Thomas sees no reason to do that.
I'm sure if UASF was just as hard to implement he would have done it, since he supports UASF ideologically, but you can't deny the overhead required to maintain every type of transaction serialization for every type of hardfork-coin.
He has taken a stance multiple times before that Electrum will not support or maintain code for altcoins. This stance is consistent with his past actions, since UASF would have been a long reorg and not a hardfork, so technically not an altcoin.

The term technobabble always meant to me "what people who don't understand call specialized IT vocabulary"
But then I heard CW puke up a bunch of words about how you can make un-malleable transactions by "reversing the math" etc.
Understanding 95% of what goes on in the crypto-space and listening to that guy go on about nothing made me realize the true meaning of technobabble.
It's like he read a medium article about RFC6979, unconfirmed transaction chaining, and BIP32, then just started spewing out words he saw...
idk, maybe he was just speaking some dialect of English where all those words made sense... but if I were in the audience, I wouldn't even know what to call him out on because he made not coherent technical statements at all.

I think this could be easily added into the payment protocol, and even be added into a new arg in the bitcoin: URI protocol.
Basically just add a flag saying "hidefee" which will then show the user a sent amount (including the miner fee) and the recipient just receives the amount - miner fee.
ex. 0.01 BTC for an item, you scan the QR that has "hidefee" flag (which the merchant placed there) and your client says "Are you ok with paying 0.01 BTC?" and shows fee as 0. in ACTUALITY, the transaction is for 0.0099 BTC to the merchant and 0.0001 BTC for fee. The merchant, having set the flag, is expecting 0.0099 BTC, so all is good.

They already have a Bitcoin-like digital currency that the government controls fully. It's called the US dollar and basically every other currency on the planet.
The ONLY thing that differentiates Bitcoin from such currencies is DEcentralized emergent consensus.
As soon as you place the Fed at the helm and give them 100% sole access to what goes in the ledger.... then every person with 2 IQ points to rub together says "well, if we're making a centralized consensus database, why not use PostgreSQL instead of a blockchain... it's much faster and more efficient."
The Fed won't just stand up and be like "ok IBM, go out and make the most wasteful and non-useful database schema for centralized data stores in the world for us to use."
Blockchains are only useful as a DEcentralized data store for achieving emergent consensus. A centralized blockchain is NOT POSSIBLE, because then it would just be an SQL database on someone's server, and this would be no different from what we have today.
IBM is just think-tanking.

The problem with a subreddit is that if you're having trouble with paypal, you probably won't have the skills necessary to make a subreddit... let alone know what reddit is.
In fact, it is the fact that most people who show interest in Bitcoin are "tech-savvy" compared to the general public that causes places like to appear. They are problem solvers, and when they look at bitcoin they try to figure it out in their head, and that gives them questions. This is the same as stackexchange for any programming language, internet-savvy users tend to be curious in how things work.
Showing that subreddit as proof that Joe and Bob Smith will never use Bitcoin is ludicrous. Joe and Bob don't go on Stackexchange and feel a need to "learn about PHP" or whatever.
Joe and Bob will tap two buttons on a Bitcoin wallet app and be done with it if the need arises.

Authy is prone to SMS jacking if you have device recovery enabled. So the best way is to sync it to two devices (your real phone and a burner phone) and store the second phone in a safe. Then disable multi-device restoring. Occasionally check the phone to make sure it didn't die in the safe, and if it does, get a new phone, activate multidevice, sync to the new phone, then disable again.

You would make the software avoid sending all funds to one side.
Alice's wallet would see Mallory trying to send the whole balance over to Alice, and throw an exception "MustLeaveSpaceForPunishFeeOrBitcoinNetworkFee" (we can name them later lol)
Now, I think the use case of a complete newb needing to open channels with 0 commitments, I think that the "Good Samaritans" who will be picking up the slack for these new users are companies like Coinbase etc. who will likely run 24/7 nodes and watch all their own transactions with many large bloom filters. They also want to corner the newb market into using their site (or browser plugin or whatever) because then they can charge routing fees to people sending TO the newbs... the more newbs they take on for "free" the more traffic they can route through their node(s).
Remember, Lightning is not consensus sensitive per se, so they could make a special client that does not throw an exception when the end user has 0 commitment, and Coinbase is watching always anyways, so the only risk is bitcoin fees, and maybe they could strike a deal with a large mining pool to help support the large swaths of new users.
(Coinbase would only need to call in the favor from the mining pool if a new account tried to fraud them) But to be honest, a bleed rate of a couple hundred punish transaction fees ($5 a day maybe? 5 cents x 100?) would not be bad to spark bitcoin adoption.
Lightning would be an easier way to gateway people into bitcoin, as they don't need to own any to open a channel (technically) as long as they start out with 0.
I'm starting to go OT.
tl;dr: There could be an unwritten rule that all software throws up red flags when you or the other person tries to send the whole channel to the other side. So unless the other person tricked you into using their modified client, you'd be aware and your software would prevent it (unlike raw bitcoin, you need to ACK in order to update the channel)

I think tbh bitcoin can scale to VISA-level transaction amounts with 3 simple things:
1. Block size limit increase.
2. IBLT (Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables) for block propagation.
3. Moore's law for hard disk cost per GB, cost per Mbps bandwidth, cost per MHz CPU cycles, and cost per GB RAM.
However, these are all things that will take time, and if the world wants to adopt bitcoin tomorrow, there will be a lot of bottle necks.
This is why I am of the mind that mass adoption is still a bit of a ways off... or at least I hope it is.
But then of course I don't view Bitcoin as a company that I need to "move forward" or an investment I need to "make returns" on... I view it as a protocol that will change the world, so we should take our time and get it right rather than rushing it so we can make a quick buck.

bitcoinfees is a closed source implementation of some magic voodoo which they make look like it's the actual mempool of some node they own.
Johoe's client is open source and we can know (I have one running on my node just for kicks) that it is actually accurately depicting the mempool.
Just from looking at 21 txes, it looks like they never drop transactions ever. 90% of those low fee transactions are probably transactions that were in their mempool since April and were RBFed and thus have a separate txid... the assumption that txid is always the same, and overlooking a cleaning step to run after each block being found based on used utxos instead of txid... these are two things most amateur devs with Bitcoin would mess up.
But I have no clue, as it is not open source.

Set RBF on, and send out with super low fee (like 0.000003 BTC/kB) and pray. If you get a broadcast error, try connecting to other servers. Someone will broadcast the transaction eventually.

Voting for some small petty organization sure, maybe...
But I would DEFINITELY not want this for government election voting.
The secret ballot is what prevents people from buying votes.
In the current system, sure you have the possibility of vote counting fraud etc., but no one could buy votes from individuals, as individuals do not get a notarized receipt of the way they voted.
If we used counterparty, it would be as trivial as:
A: Vote for me and I'll give you 1 BTC.
B: Sweet! Here's the transaction on the blockchain which you can open in counterparty explorer and prove that I made this vote, here's my signed message with the same private key of the same public key.
A: sweet! here's your 1 BTC!
x however many people they needed to coerce or pay off.
Now imagine oppressive regimes trying to fake an "election":
Anyone who votes against me will be killed, we have all your public keys on file and we're watching you.
Doesn't really work too well...
(Why don't we just encrypt the vote and only let the vote counters decrypt?) Nope, what's to stop someone from voting right in front of the guy paying them off to prove they voted?

You do not need to see the addresses.
The unsigned transaction carries with it all the info your offline wallet needs:
"Hey offline, buddy, this input is the 67th private key, this one is the 278th private key and this one is the 9276th private key." and your offline wallet reads that, checks that those keys work out to those pubkey hashes, then signs.
Increasing gap limit or whatever will not change this... it will just add more addresses to your wallet file, which is useless, as you won't be checking balances. :-\
@_date: 2015-02-06 07:33:12
No. You are thinking of "a bitcoin node using SPV" a la bitcoinJ.
SPV merely denotes the methodology of verifying the transactions and merkle tree against.
Electrum downloads the block headers and verifies all transactions using the merkle root and the supplied transaction + merkle block.
So Electrum is SPV, but it is not an active listening node on the bitcoin network (a la breadwallet, bitcoinJ etc)

BIP39 has password functionality built in.
Try restoring a phrase using Mycelium. It asks for an optional password in addition to the phrase.
But even with no password, BIP39 is just an encoding of random 128-256 bits of data.
Basically, you start with 128 bits of random data, hash them to get the checksum. Only add the first x bits of the checksum to the end of the 128 bits of data. Where x is equal to the size of the data divided by 32. (So 4 in our case)
This gives you 132 bits of data, separate those bits into groups of 11 bits. 12 x 11 = 132, so we have 12 groups of 11 bits.
11 bits in binary can range from 0 to 2047. This is the length of the wordlist.
Convert each 11 bit group into decimal base 10, find the word at that position, and separate each word with a space, and there you go.
To brute force every HD master key, you would need to do all that, then generate the seed (which has some light anti-brute forcing built in) and check the balance of the first address of all the popular HD paths.

I run a few nodes at home and on VPSes (my home networking is a mess and I don't want to mess with it to use my node from my phone):
1. maintaining a server / separate machine at home is extra work most people would not do.
2. A full node that drops out and comes online every 15 minutes when the user opens and closes their laptop is barely useful to the network, and shitty usability for the user if they're running Core's QT wallet. (connecting to localhost via Copay while running Bitcore's Nodejs bindings for Core locally, though, is great. Highly recommended)
3. No one is going to do that without a CS degree and some love for bitcoin.
4. SPV is a good tradeoff for people who can't do that.
Running around and screaming from the hilltops that SPV's sky is falling is only putting FUD into the hearts of newbies and the less technically savvy and imo is in poor taste.

Everytime you receive bitcoin, you receive a bill in that value. Just like a 5 dollar bill or a 10 dollar bill, you hold these in your wallet.
If you receive 0.045 BTC, then you have a 0.045 BTC bill in your wallet.
Let's say you receive small donations frequently of varying amounts ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 BTC
Now you need to send someone 0.3 BTC
You look at your wallet and see you have:
0.1101, 0.24, 0.3501
Now there are lots of ways you could do this.
Use 0.3501 and give yourself 0.05 change... Leaving the 0.0001 left over to tip the miners.
Or use the 0.1101 and 0.24 together and give yourself 0.05 change leaving the 0.0001 for the miners.
You could even use all three and send 0.4001 as change to yourself leaving 0.0001 for miners.
Wallets take care of all these things for you so you don't have to worry.
The only time you have to worry is using a mixture of wallets.
For example, one of my friends imported a paper wallet to Electrum, sent half of it to someone, then deleted his electrum wallet.
He assumed the bitcoin he didn't use would stay in his paper wallet, but they didn't. (This was a while back)

Note: This service is reliable. But it requires you have the wallet file, and a rough idea of what kind of password you would put on it.
However, wallet file encryption was only added in Bitcoin at v0.4.0 in 2011, so likely the wallet file (if it exists) has no password on it, and popping it into a new Bitcoin Core setup will allow the user to send the bitcoins once he syncs the blockchain.
My advice:
1. Figure out which computer he was using at the time.
2. Extract the hard drive from that computer.
3. Search the harddrive for the wallet file. (DO NOT BOOT FROM THIS HARD DRIVE) Default file locations are located on the wiki.
4. If it's not found, run a deep scan for deleted files in the unused disk space. There are many tools to do this.
If you don't know how to do this, find someone you trust to do it for you. Someone who wouldn't steal 2.8 million dollars.

All of the 0 conf proposals are great on paper, but then of course all that means nothing if the implementation is poor or the user experience is poor.
Bitcoin was the opposite. The paper was crazy and outlandish for the time and Satoshi was ridiculed by many, but the implementation was good, so it got perfected by the community.

That's what effective entropy is.
If I run two hashes for each try instead of one, I have increased the effective entropy by one bit. x 2
10 bits would be x 1024
So if you have something that takes 1024 times as long as normal to do one try, you are increasing the effective entropy by 10 bits. A 40 bit password would require 50 bits or brute forcing (equivalent) to crack.

Imagine there was a restaurant with (nearly) unlimited seats, and you can sit down wherever you'd like, and the restaurant is nice. (mempool)
However, if a waiter doesn't take your order and bring your food, there's really no reason for you to be waiting there... so you will eventually have to leave (I said "nearly" unlimited)
So, because there are way too few hamburgers to fill all the orders, waiters decided to get picky...
Customers, from the beginning of this restaurant, have been waving dollar bills in the air as pre-emptive tips to the waiter to get the waiter to take their order.
Now more and more people are coming, but the burger quota for the day never increases.
So to make sure they get their burger and don't get kicked out for waiting too long... they wave more money in the air.
It's not an exact science, and the miners aren't "asking" for it per se... but it just naturally so happens that if you have 5000 transactions in your pool of possible candidates for the next block, and only 1000000 bytes of those will fit... it makes sense to order the transactions by most fees per byte, and start plugging away until blocks are full.
If more people send transactions with higher fees, they are essentially "cutting in line" ahead of you... and no wallet software monitors the whole network and tell you when newer high fee transactions appear...
So essentially it's a guessing game right now.
21 has a fees website... but all that tells you is "Well, we are watching the mempool and blocks and how long each transaction takes to get included... then we estimate how much fees you need now to get in a block quickly...
But if a sudden surge of high fee transactions comes... you're going to wait.
tl;dr it's a cluster fuck. Welcome to Bitcoin!

Nah, most likely Satoshi would have switched the mining algorithm and rolled back your blocks under the assumption that the current algorithm was broken.
There was a bug where someone mined billions of bitcoins. Satoshi didn't just sit there and say "ohhh you clever miner, you got me. Bitcoin's dead, you win." Everyone agreed "umm, that's not normal and is likely a bug, so let's all run this new version that ignores that block and fixes that bug." The same would happen if suddenly &lt;=2016 blocks were found in less than a second and difficulty ramped up by a couple thousand fold.
If your goal was to mine as many bitcoins as possible, a 10 TH/s ASIC was a couple million times the total mining power of the network, so every 20 minutes, run the ASIC for 1 microsecond (10 MH) and you'll probably find a block. Or you could modify your program to shut off every time you find a block. Then all you have to do is press a button and within milliseconds you'll have a block. Then as not to raise suspicion, only press this button every 20 minutes or so to mine every other block.

Most wallets do this:
1. Calculate the public key from the private key.
2. Calculate the address from the public key.
3. Go to a blockexplorer website in the background and ask it "how many bitcoins are on this address?"
4. They receive a list of all the utxos from the blockexplorer.
5. They use that info to send all the bitcoins from that private key.
Depends on the wallet, really, but for the most part it is something similar to this...
the reason why is that like you said, making a bloom filter for one key and re-syncing the whole blockchain in SPV mode would take anywhere up to 10-20 minutes. \

1. create a 34 character long address that starts with 1 and doesn't use 0(zero) O(capital O) I(capital I) l(lowercase L) with your desired prefix.
2. convert that base58 into hex (not hash, convert)
3. trim the right side of the hex until you only have 42 hex letters left (the far left should start with "00" (two zeros))
4. take the double sha256 of that hex turned into bytes.
5. take the first 4 bytes of the resulting hash and stick it on the end of 3.
6. Convert the value into base58 again.

If the sender is honest, then orphaned blocks don't matter. It will show up as 1 confirmation for a bit, then return to 0 confirmations, then get picked up in a later block and have 1 confirmation again, then 2, then 3, etc etc.
If the sender is malicious and trying to re-spend the same coins back to themselves... AND their master plan is relying on an anomaly that only occurs maybe once or twice every day or two, AND also relies on the payment receiver being on the orphaned chain... then they are a stupid person.
There are MUCH easier, MUCH more sophisticated attacks that would enable stealing of 0 conf spends back... but the cost of performing them with any semblance of consistency would cost so much to the attacker that they would only sanely do it on larger transactions.
Anyone who says "as long as I make a tx with no fee and write a python script to double spend to 5 different node with a proper fee and then DNS poison the merchant to seeing my version of the blockchain and ..." and passes it off like some guy can do this all with their smartphone while at the register of starbucks is hilarious.
let's say 1 in every 500 people could do that and did do that. $5 coffee cups would mean $5 out of $500 was lost.
Now lets say they decided to wait for 3 transactions.
1. cost of having tons of people waiting around their store.
2. lost customers who peek in, think "oh, too crowded" and leave without buying.
etc. etc.
I understand the idea behind these arguments. "Let's make bitcoin better and more secure, even with 0 confirmations!" but tbh, even if replace by fee were implemented and widely used, coffee shops would never make you wait for confirmations. They lose much more by making you wait for coffee.

I wouldn't recommend my grandmother to sign up for compuquest and get her own e-mail IP address to send e-mails in the late 80s. And if she started going on a rampage saying how computers will never catch on and that I'm wasting my time and money, I'd tell her she should stay clear of e-mail for the time being. She is content with snail mail, so let her use snail mail I say.
But now lots of grandmas have a smart phone with a gmail account built in.
You are under the assumption that Bitcoin never changes. This assumption is false. Bitcoin will change, and is changing right now.
If you can't grasp how to use it. Set it down for a while. Store some coin in a paper wallet and wait it out.
If someday Bitcoin dies and you happen upon your worthless paper wallet with x BTC in it, you can tell a story to your grandkids about the failed laughing stock of technological money, or the heroic tale of a society taking back power from corrupt banks and their puppets... Whichever spin you want to put on it... And if it succeeded then I'm sure it will be so easy for you to securely use it... Then you can go buy a boat or something.

1. Try entering your phrase in the box. (The "invalid phrase" alert is kinda fast, so you might want to copy paste in from memo pad or something)
2. make sure the Custom Path says m/0'/0/0
3. Check the address to see if it's yours.
It will either say "invalid address" or nothing, in which case you must check the address at that custom path on some site for a any history.
If there is any history on that address (even if balance is 0), it is likely your phrase.

It is TOTALLY about mining.
Just not mining for profit. (aka "what we associated mining with up until now")
The idea is this:
You know how the internet is built on a system if ads where your eyeballs pay for all the free content at a rate of 1 cent for every thousand views or so, well 21 is making this library as a "hey guys, let's do some ELSE with mining besides earning bitcoin as the sole goal. Let's make mining the new revenue stream generator, or the IoT backbone, or whatever you can dream up. Just stop thinking of mining as only monetary profit through bitcoins mined."
The hardware being expensive is to deter for-profit miners from hoarding them. (If they were profitable, you bet it would happen)
This is the start of a market for small, embedded, slightly (and/or artificially) not profitable miners embedded in everything.
In exchange for that, you point your tv to samsung pool, your fridge to GM pool, your phone to google pool, granting the pool operating company with a small stream of nascent coins, granting their company the right to write into the worlds only trustless ledger. In exchange for this, they could incentivise users to upgrade to latest devices by offering discounts for newer devices based off the extra utility gained from having faster hashes in their pool.
Even if it's not profitable from a bitcoin gained perspective, there are gains realized outside of monetary gain that can make up for being slightly not-profitable.
I am really grasping at straws, because imagining a future not yet here is hard to do. And tbh your word is as good as mine when talking about dreams and ambitions.
But I think 21 is on to something with the direction.
We just need to stop thinking about mining as "must be profitable, or ur stupid stfu lol" then I think a lot of people will wake up to the possibilities.

    And your result is.......
    win!
* Click the "fork" link on the upper left. It will allow you to edit the code.
* Change the Transaction ID and secret in the quotes.
* Change the Bet Number to match the number of the bet you did (The hardest bet being 64 and the easiest bet 61440)
* Click Run
* Check the stdout of the resulting page. It will give you the results.
If you click the sunglasses button you can make the link private so no one can see your code (your transaction ID) without knowing the link.
Though the best method is to install python on your computer (Macs have it pre-installed, you just need to learn how to use it) save that code to a .py file and run it.

Use Google Spreadsheets. So much easier. If you're tinfoil hatting, I could understand why you'd want a local copy and not to put it in the cloud... but I hope your Excel version is old and you only access the file from an offline computer, Excel 2010 and later could very well be sending back info to motherbase... yikes.


"the price" meaning today's price? Any given day's price?
My sheet has it so that I type in an amount I bought, the amount I bought it for (exactly how much I paid) and a weighted average of the top exchanges is also grabbed at the moment I enter, and placed into my file as an unchanging number.
I find this to suit my needs better, as I know that the info is untouched.
If you are relying on historical data always, then what if the site you pull data from suddenly loses all data before 2016 some day? PITA to fix... so I'd rather just have my sheet automatically grab the current rates for me and auto-paste them as a value into a cell for me.

Excel sheets allow VBA scripts for automating this type of stuff.

pretty sure the seller won't jack up prices to the very maximum they feel they can extort... err, *negotiate* for.

The issue with warpwallet is not that the function is not slow enough. It's slow and memory intensive, duh.
The point is that if it takes me two seconds to do what normally takes me one second, you have only increased the "security" by one bit. As with every guess you are taking twice as long.
Just for kicks, I implemented the warpwallet in python using pip's pbkdf2 and scrypt libraries, and for the hash parameters just used standard hashlib.
One calculation of warp wallet was equivalent (in computation time) to 2,497,152 iterations of a single sha256 hash.
I ran warp wallet with differing strings of length and took the average time, then did the same with sha256 and took the average times.
While this is slow, it's still only a little over 21 bits of added effective entropy.
Meaning you would need a 107 bit passphrase to have "equivalent security" to a random 128 bit key.
With a wordlist of 10000 words, randomly picked by a machine, it would be 9 words long.
5 words (assuming perfect randomness) would be a little over 66 bits of entropy, with effective time for brute forcing being equivalent to 87.6 bit entropy single hash brainwallet.
scrypt is a great algorithm, and it is very expensive.
Trust me, I know that it's better than single sha256 brainwallet.
It's just that people look at the site, see it takes "a really long time" (mostly because it's javascript in a browser, ie. my python script took 2.23 seconds on average to do one try and my PC is shit) and decide "oh ok, that means I can pick my dogs name and my mom's maiden name as my password"
Sure, if you diceware a 107 bit phrase up and use it, good for you. But most people will not be so inclined.

Electrum is easiest to get set up, but Armory is a lot more robust. (Your watch-only client will need the entire blockchain though)
Both are able to handle offline signing of transactions. (keeps your private keys from ever touching an online computer)
However, AFAIK Armory is not RFC6979 compliant and Electrum is. This means that with Armory there is a possibility of leaking private keys through bad randomness during signing.

2. You can totally have a lightning channel between your cell phone and another person's cell phone.

Does not solve it, just pushes it back.
Let's assume there is a rainbow table of hashes for every brainwallet method for any possible passphrase with up to 20 bits of entropy.
As time moves on, this creeps upwards.
However, if I salt the passphrase with my email, your rainbow tables are now useless except for the small percent that would happen to have my email address at the beginning etc.
If you are using 256 bits of entropy, then for all intents and purposes, yes. That solves it, as by time they crack your password, they will have guessed all possible sha256 hashes.
Salting, when used with strong hashing with lots of iterations, can protect against sweeping rainbow table attacks, and forces the attacker to pick one target at a time. Protecting passphrases with lower entropy.
However, the problem with entropy is there is no absolute way of measuring it... So salting is not an excuse to use weak passphrases, it is a technique to prevent large scale correlation attacks etc. (rainbow tables, hashed password leaks etc)

The opponents would try to start a debate about the ethics of blah blah or try to call the cops for owning an unsafe vehicle, or anything that would prevent the race from happening.
You want the second you start revving your engine to be the first time they know how much power you have, and 10 seconds before you crash to be the time when they know you cut the steering wheel.

Ironically they are shitting themselves constantly.
Using XRP as an exchange sucks because fees mean absolutely nothing, you get "validated" when someone randomly decides to include your tx.
Which means you need to adjust your maxLedger offset and re-send............. but since xrp doesn't use utxos you better hope you don't automatically resend when Ledger too high errors occur...

Overlay letters to see if every black spot from a given letter is black in your filter. If all black spots match, hooray positive!
If a white spot from your box is covered by the overlay with black, negative.
The more letters you write the more likely a random letter NOT in the filter will just so happen to match up, this is called a false positive.
However, a false negative is impossible.

The truth is that Bitcoin is a protocol with specific rules.
Some people interpret those rules as "existing to serve purpose A" or "B" but this is irrelevant to Bitcoin. It doesn't have a "purpose" but merely a "ruleset" and purpose is a construct that only sentient beings can hold or attribute to things.
This is why we are debating.
People who believe Bitcoin is meant to serve purpose A see a rule change to serve purpose B as "is not bitcoin"
Then people who look at the protocol and say "the property which we overlooked because it was irrelevant for so long is now preventing Bitcoin from fulfilling purpose B. We must change the ruleset to allow it to do so.
Unfortunately, the problem with the bitcoin protocol in this sense, is that it resists change stronger in one direction than another. Loosening of rules creates a completely new coin, tightening of the rules does not, as long as a large portion of miners switch.
Your argument is basically "a large portion of people believe that Bitcoin has purpose B" whereas the other side really doesn't need to argue, since inaction in large enough populations guarantees Bitcoin doesn't change.
I guess we'll see what happens with the whole NYA, UASF, ABC, etc. stuff come August.

Looking at the thread you commented in, I have come to the conclusion:
1. Some people started mentioning crypto.
2. Lots of other crypto followers went to the thread from a link on a crypto subreddit.
3. Ensuing list of what looked like 5-10 child comments (all deleted now) which I assume one was yours.
4. Since the rules state "don't mention/promote speculative investments" and they view crypto as speculative.
5. Your comment was just "so the implication is "invest in bitcoin" with no explanation except for a link to an (admittedly) echo chamber of positivity about bitcoin. This can be construed as "pumping" as per their rule. If you had talked about the high risk of bitcoin and how many people have lost their money, then at the end of that, pointed them to balanced articles talking about the prospects of bitcoin, you probably would have been fine. (or not, we will never know)
Sure, we can just label as devils for the IRAs and mutual funds... but I feel bad for them, as they probably have people pumping penny stocks all the time, and they have grouped us in with those.
In my personal opinion, bitcoin is more of a developer recommend (ie. "study bitcoin, learn to code with it, it will be worth a lot in the future regardless of bitcoin's price") than an investor recommend (ie. "hey bobby jo, I know you want to invest your family's nest egg in some stocks... but why not invest in bitcoin!?")
people who go to personalfinance are not looking to "MAKE IT BIG, HUGE RETURNS WOOHOO!!!" but rather are looking for stable consistent returns.
I love bitcoin. But I do not recommend my friends invest in it before they fully understand the risks.

PSBT is a great format. Myself and some others were trying to come up with something similar internally for passing along partially signed multi-sig txes for a while... but we ended up just JSON.stringify an interface with all the data we needed...
It wasn't elegant so we never bothered proposing a BIP and only used it internally.
PSBT is great though. Once it gets more wide-spread support from libraries we will definitely switch over.

We don't need to trade both coins to be vulnerable to replay attacks.
We need to watch both chains even if we don't offer both coins as trading pairs, because otherwise we are signing off utxos valid on both chains and only receiving coins on one side of the chain (during a replay attack) which means we are holding 1 ETH and 1 ETC for Bob, but if we are 100% ignorant of ETC, then Bob can withdraw 1 ETH (and receive 1 ETC as a bonus since our utxos are valid on both chains) then he will only deposit the side that we are looking at.
Since Exchanges do not withdraw the same coins you deposit, Bob just repeats this process until he has stolen all of our ETC.
Then when ETC actually has a price, we have goxxed ourselve for not paying attention and only looking at one side of the fork.
Making sure our utxos are not valid on both chains is known as "replay protection"

because BIP148 is not about activating SegWit. That is the goal, but details matter.
BIP148 says that after a certain point, blocks that do not signal bit 1 in the BIP9 signalling mechanism will be marked as invalid.
If they make a new Segwit that is activated via some other method besides bit 1 of the BIP9 mechanism, there will still be a UASF that disrupts the network's normal activity.
This is why Segwit2x is considering signaling bit 1 AND some other bit to signal support so that people who don't support 2 MB, but only support Segwit will be happy, and we can kick the can down the road until the 2MB (hard fork) part takes effect...
Plus side: no network disruption in short term.
Negative side: makes it unclear whether there will be trouble when the 2 MB part rolls around.

If you have a single sig HD wallet 10 + 148 x inputCount + 34 x outputCount.
So for one input two output that would be 226 bytes.
However, how many inputs your wallet chooses for you depends on how many times you have received bitcoin in the past and how much each time, since an input is literally pointing to a previous transaction saying "see that X BTC I received at that transaction right there? I'm going to include that in this transaction."

The question is: would you rather have your bitcoin be lost because someone hacked your computer? OR would you rather have your bitcoin be lost because you made a mistake and accidentally wrote down your password wrong and can't figure it out so your bitcoins are lost forever?
From a developers POV, the former is much better, as long as the developer makes an attempt to make the app "secure within reason" then no one will ever blame them.
If a user locks themselves out (from watching github repos of major wallets for years) 100% of the time they blame the wallet, because that makes them feel better.
I totally understand why Jaxx took this stance, but I think they stepped a little too far out of the "within reason" part of the security aspect.

A bank once took orders from some government official who mistook me for some criminal, and stole all my money and froze all my cards. Unluckily, I only had about $50 on me in cash.
Took me a whole month to sort things out. It was a nightmare.
That was how I met Bitcoin.  
There is no bank of Bitcoin they can call up and put a hold or a freeze on. (Though I'm sure an exchange could do that, so be careful.)
I know Bitcoin sounds like a scam until you understand it... and that "not being easily seized by government" doesn't seem desirable until you actually get your money seized for no reason, and without fessing up to their error, they just act like "oh well you don't need money to live anyways amirite?" and give it back to you.
Which is why I will keep my node running as long as I can... and the day when it is no longer viable for me to run my node will be a sad day for me.

They could sell greenaddress instant confirms and take a fee. Therefore there is an incentive to prevent actual scaling solutions."

The attack surface can never become larger by splitting trust among multiple parties.
If we assume your chance of getting successfully attacked is always less than 100% then trusting two companies would multiply their probabilities.
To make it easy to understand:
Pretend a 50% chance Trezor tries to steal.
Also pretend Ledger or Greenaddress has a 50% chance of trying to steal.
Splitting custody across both apps would be 50% x 50% which is 25%.
Now, you would increase your attack vector if you gave BOTH softwares COMPLETE custody of your funds.

When will we actually see usage like that?
Assuming segwit activates on mainnet before end of year, and a few of the major wallets implement new versions including segwit, there is still two major issues for each wallet.
1. Most wallets don't have auto-upgrade for security reasons, so they can't force people to use segwit.
2. Even if they add support, they can't stop supporting the old wallet formats (Electrum still supports their ooooold recovery phrases, for example). blockchain.info is probably smacking their head over the countless support requests of botched "upgrades" to their new HD wallet structure... I can imagine a similar headache when trying to coerce users from using HD wallets into using HD segwit wallets. (remember, whether there are transaction size savings or not is depending on the signatures... which if you are spending bitcoins on a normal 1 address or a multi-sig 3 address, you can not use segwit until you move your funds to a segwit multi-sig or segwit single sig wallet.)
So this process requires:
1. Segwit activate on mainnet
2. Wallet devs implement it
3. Users switch from the old wallet to the new segwit wallets in their favorite wallet software (requiring them to send bitcoin on the blockchain in order to move into it)
The process seems similar to the process of P2SH multisig, although without the hurdle of trying to find a user-friendly way to do multisig... so I think the adoption will be a couple times faster than multisig adoption.
We won't be seeing 2.6 MB blocks on mainnet for quite a while. I'd ballpark maybe about 1 year or so from activation before we see 2.6 MB. (assuming no hard fork happens before then)
I'm open to alternative estimates.
Exciting times though, nonetheless.

It waits for you to copy a bitcoin address, and every time you copy something it checks if you copied a bitcoin address, if you did, it quietly "copies" the hacker's address so now when you paste, you are pasting the hacker's address.
Careless people don't check.

PGP has a dead-man's switch feature.
When you publish your public key chain you can add an entry saying "don't trust this key in 2 years (or however long you want) unless I tell you otherwise."
The fact that they let it expire is an indication that they are asleep at wheel when it comes to their PGP management. So why should we trust that they haven't leaked their private key?
I downgraded their trust level from marginal to none on my web of trust.

There's this virtual currency (仮想通貨) called Bitcoin, and it's making waves around the world. The US FBR looked into it and said companies dealing in Bitcoin are subject to federal monetary regulation. India's central bank says it does not officially approve of payment with virtual currencies. Japan central bank has said it is studying Bitcoin, and has interest in it due to the recent increase in price.
Sorry if my English is bad.
Overall, a very objective overview of Bitcoin. Good job Yomiuri.

I own Trezor, HW.1, Ledger Nano, Ledger Nano S, and Ledger Blue.
1. Trezor has given me the least trouble (besides the USB cable included which sucks)
2. Ledger Blue is still very buggy. It takes me forever to try and get Ledger apps to recognize Blue is connected, and it also feels flimsy (like if I tap it too hard I'm going to break the poor plasticy thing) BUT it's very VERY easy to recover phrases with the on-screen keyboard and predictive typing.
3. Nano S is much better than Blue, and is recognized most of the time. but the two button only input method is very very annoying and probably easy as heck for someone who has a low-res video of me fuddling with it with my big fingers will probably know my PIN (they should randomize the starting number for chist's sake)
4. Nano is most reliable of the Ledgers, but doesn't support a lot of the new flashy apps and altcoins.
5. HW.1 is great, but I literally broke one in half by accident... it's like cardboard with some metal pasted on.
I had Trezor first, and I use all my Ledgers for various things, but the one that is easiest (every time I use it all I do is plug in, click send on the app, check on the screen and tap the button, done. No fuss.) is by far the Trezor.
Disclaimer: this is only my experience. I run Linux only. I tried switching out USB cables and everything... it's always a gamble with Ledgers post-Nano-S every time I plug it in.

If not, then there are only 2 possibilities:

If they 51% the minority chain to attack it they better hope UASF support is &lt;25% otherwise they will cause their non-UASF chain to reorg into the UASF chain.
Which is why the UASF is so powerful assuming it gets more than 25%.
Whether it gets 25% or not who knows.
If everyone who will support UASF on 8/1 came out now, it would give the other side time to prepare and run smear campaigns.
I completely understand the logic for a quiet supporter(s) suddenly appearing 2 days prior to 8/1.
All I can say is that 8/1 will be popcorn material either way it goes. I'll have my node terminals up on one screen and r/btc and r/bitcoin on the other. Buttered popcorn with light salt.

You are confused.
Segwit alone is a max x4 multiplier.
No one has ever said the Lightning Network (of which lnd is one implementation of) was just a measly x2 x4 multiplier.
It's more like an infinity multiplier, as it removes the scaling from transaction basis to channel basis. Potentially 1.5-2 transactions on chain could represent 2 transactions, or 9999999999999999999999999999999 transactions for all we know.

And then when Consensus 2018 rolls around and the Consensus 2017 effort is still being "debated" by people, a new Consensus 2018 agreement will roll around.
Repeat until Bitcoin is dead OR Jihan's pools which don't split miner fees among pool miners earn over 10 billion dollars worth in fees.
Consensus 2017 agreed that Segwit is what we all want.
BIP148 is giving them what they want, if they want to code a 2MB HF after BIP148 passes Segwit as-is, then hey, they have 80% of the miners so let them work that out and it should be great.

Yeah, those transactions' fees are 100x larger than they needed to be, even with this inflated fee market.
No one forced them to spend 30 BTC in fees, 0.3 BTC would have been more than necessary.
This was a butterfingers scenario I'm guessing.

You can recover blockchain.info's new phrase structure into most other wallets

@_date: 2017-06-20 08:48:06


I wouldn't be surprised if you supported BU, but even if you don't the point still stands. The "SegWit is so complex!" fallacy was started when the big-block crowd was 100% behind BU and BU was ironically bugging off the network left and right.
I can guarantee you Facebook's codebase is complex, and adding complex new features probably made that codebase even more complex... but


Testing the crap out of SegWit for over a year now is anything but reckless.
I would say that pushing out huge sweeping changes as production binaries with no public peer review and refusing to release the source is the definition of reckless. I would hope that you agree.
@_date: 2016-07-02 12:36:04
Also denote that this is for versions x through y of Copay and update it.
m/44'/0'/0'/0 is rather recent. I made a recovery tool before Bitpay made their own official one, and it was so old, it only supports the old m/45' paths.

people who lose money from brainwallets either:
1. Don't realize it yet, as they probably don't check their wallet every day.
2. Don't want to advertise their failure.
The problem with bitcoin and entropy is a HUGE one.
The maximum effective entropy of a bitcoin private key is 128 bits (keysize / 2 due to ECDSA brute force efficiencies with secp256k1) which is an extremely hard amount of entropy for a human to come up with.
Even with a wordlist of 10,000 words picked at random by a computer, you would need a 10 word phrase to meet that requirement.
"But 80 bits is super strong, especially when you use a log algorithm"
No. Long algorithm MAYBE increases effective entropy (not real entropy) by a few bits. Even if it was 10. The effect is lessened as the requirements increase.
The salt would be a great idea if it were also random. But again. e-mail addresses would be amazingly easy to get a hold of.
The only saving grace of warpwallet is that it increased the effective entropy high enough to discourage small research lab level cracking attempts, and is frankly not popular enough to warrant someone else trying to brute force it.
But I can guarantee you if warp wallet was widely known as being used by millions and Roger Ver and other early adopters all used it. I guarantee many people would lose money.
tl;dr you think you're safe, but that's because no one cares enough to crack warp wallets.
@_date: 2017-06-28 13:38:23
Depends on which line.
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:44:14
1. It helps prevent address reuse. If we only use the 0 path, I would need to explicitly tell my wallet "I gave out address 0, 1, 2 but not 3, but I gave out 6 and 9, so don't use those for change" which is a pain, and easily fixed by just using a separate path.
2. Your problem is for non-utxo based chains. BIP stands for "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal" so asking a BIP to include considerations for non-bitcoin chains will not produce good results.
If it bothers you so much, propose an EIP that references BIP44 and adds on extra functionality for non-utxo chains that you want to include.
@_date: 2017-06-27 08:07:16
By definition, if there are apps that support the phrases from the wordlist, then the wordlist would be somewhere in the source of the app.
Assuming the future is not filled with closed source bitcoin apps, I think you'll be fine ;-)

Security is a dance.
Users will choose the most easy thing as long as it "feels secure" to them. They never take the time to research whether something is actually secure.
Companies need to make the most secure option "seem easy" at least, and be easy optimally.

Two things:
1. I assume the unit is contacting a computer via Wi-fi? or is it using 3G or some other radio? Either way, what kind of encryption does the transmission use? Anyone with a packet sniffer and a wireless card on their laptop could grab the private keys if it was unencrypted.
2. Any plans to support JPY and offer services in Japan? (I'm a Japanese translator doing pro bono translations for bitcoin related sites)

Well, there are still aspects in life that are suited for offline interactions, like contracts, dating, certain jobs, etc.
However, looking back to the internet in its infancy, it wasn't fit for a lot of the things we use it for today. The technology just wasn't there.
In the same way, you are right, bitcoin in its current state is not a viable option for a lot of aspects in the monetary space.
However, I choose bitcoin because I see the future of bitcoin as something that needs to happen to this world. It will get better.
And if it doesn't, and it crashes and disappears from this world, I am prepared to lose all my money.
I'd rather lose all my assets believing in a revolution than keep some assets in a constantly devaluing personally degrading system.
