Agreed. Officially according to blockchain.info they never have access to your private keys and so they shouldn't be able to ever take your funds, but it's still possible for some nefarious insider to set up a crawler that steals your private keys as you go. The safest storage is always something offline that you can be confident only you have access to.

I've started collecting any good open source or creative commons Bitcoin-related images I know of in a Google Drive folder: [Bitcoin (CC)]( But it's a real problem, there aren't many...

The USD is not an IOU. It's legal tender. Once upon a time it was an IOU, but that ended when the all standards for backing the dollar were over. USD is "legal tender" meaning that you have to accept it for payment–or else.

I don't think the focus is using Bitcoin on eBay, though that could totally happen. I think the focus is that if Paypal (owned by eBay) became a Bitcoin wallet almost anyone anywhere could accept Bitcoin without new accounts anywhere else.

Fair point. I do keep a small amount of bitcoin in a Coinbase account for small expenses, but not more than I'm afraid to lose. That's the important point, most people store TOO much in online exchanges, without knowledge of the risk.

If you're looking for USD, the best thing to do might be to set up a recurring sell on Coinbase for 10 BTC a day, that way you get close to the current average, rather than throwing darts at the current price for such a huge sum.
**Note**: I don't recommend you sell all your BTC. At least keep 1-2 so you can benefit if and when the price soars.

Yup! 2,000.97 BTC. Last transaction was a deposit in June of 2011. Looks reasonable to me.
