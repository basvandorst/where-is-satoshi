Sounds great!
Thank you for doing this!

Changetip is what's going to get Bitcoins into the hands of people who want to get their feet wet. Bitcoins are still difficult to acquire for some, this is a perfectly acceptable way of distributing Bitcoins (even if it's small amounts) to the curious.

VoS has been nothing but good to me. I beta tested some of their features. Flawless support, great transaction times, friendly people. I hope this works out :)

Just for future reference: "A conservative estimate is one that is cautious to avoid excess in approximating the quantity, degree, or worth of something." It's a slightly pessimistic approach in order to be safe.
"Top end" and "conservative estimate" are pretty much opposites.

Best exchange. Thanks for the hard work!
(I've noticed that on the Bill Payment page, there were no fees listed yesterday)

Am I reading correctly that it's almost $200 to attend? I live in Dubai but that seems extremely steep :/

Congrats! I am glad that people are paying with bitcoin in so many different places now :D 
Welcome to the world of bitcoin :)

Is that a water slide? If so, I think you're the real winner here.

Price is low. Donations will be worth more in the future!
@_date: 2012-08-03 03:41:12
Awesome I've been looking for something like this for a while now :D
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:18:59
It passed it not too long ago :)

Thanks for spreading the wealth!

You can pay with USD (since it's pegged), Saudi, and Omani currency almost anywhere in Dubai.

Thank you for doing this. I wonder if there is a way to get the word out more? We need more new faces!
