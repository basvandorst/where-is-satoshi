Yes they did.

They have a store in Copenhagen, though i don't know wether the danish site/store accept bitcoins.

They did, at least in Denmark Webhallen is owned by Komplett, but they still compete with each other and Webhallen has kept their own store/design/prices.

I guess that is why you don't have any friends.

[you and the joke](
What he said is: "Debt is a promise, don't hold your promise and you'll be fine".
What i mean is that, sure, don't hold your promise, just don't expect anyone to ever trust you again.

So, do you know how i can cash them out?
EDIT: And thanks for the great explanation!

Do you have an easy way to mine litecoins and exchange them to bitcoins in under 10 lines?
I've heard the 7950 is one of the best miners that's a normal video card.
What's the difference between ASIC hardware and normal hardware?

I got 2 internets... What's that worth?

Yes that picture is from now.
I have a multibit wallet installed on my pc, no bitcoin-qt i believe.
I'm mining in the pool "slush's pool" following [this](  guide. Do i need to get a bitcoin-qt client, and if so, where do i get one?
I'm using a I5 with a 7950 AMD gpu, though, i'm just going to mine when i watch anime so it's going to be more of a hobby than something i want to rely on.
If i were to mine other coins, would they be compatible with a bitcoin wallet, or would i need other software too?
And thanks so much for your detailed answers, i really appreciate it!

Sorry, but i have another question, and thanks to you both for being so helpful!
Doing the "bitcoin rush" last year, i wanted to mine bitcoins, back when it was 100~ dollar a piece, but, i never understood how and spend hours encrypting my wallet, though, now i've got this thing:
And, it looks like it's mining, but, i'm wondering, where does the bitcoins go, and does it even work?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:07:05
So, what if i have mined now, but i don't have an account but i have just made one here:
Though, i haven't received a confirmation email yet.
Is this bad?
Would it be better to download the Bitcoin-qt instead of using multibit and GUIminer?
And once again, thanks so much!
EDIT: 
So i just got my confirmation email, it looked like this:
Worker login: xxxxxx
Worker password: xxxxx
This is not your website login, use it only for your mining software.
So, would i have to login on the GUIminer with this, 
or will it work automaticly?
Damm, i'm really sorry for bothering you so much, and thanks so much for the time you take!
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:38:54
Thanks, i think i got it working now.
Helping others is always good ;)
Thanks so much for your help, i really appreciate it!
I wish i had met someone like you a year ago, but thanks again!

Sorry, what is "crypto"?
Thanks for your help, i really appreciate it.
Would you recommend switching to MTgox/Coinbase/Bitstamp, even if they require passport + utility bill?
Once again, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:44:39
So, what i have are a bunch of microbitcoins? How do i redeem them?
I'm using BTC-E because i can trade both litecoins and bitcoins AND they do not require my passport or other personal info.
The only problem i have, which i just realized, is that, while they have many options to withdraw money, they don't have any that i can utilize right now, as i'm under 100 dollars, and i only have 4 options available:
BTC-E code's
OKpay, but they take 10 euro or 15 USD for transfers to a bank, which is a lot.
QIWI, but it's russian.
Perfect Money, but they require me to turn in passport + utility bill, which, is why i'm not on MTgox or Bitstamp.
I'm sorry i'm so helpless, the coin world is just so overwhelming!
