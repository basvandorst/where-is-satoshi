Thanks for your reply. I have my whole life savings in these coins, I'm honestly devastated. Hope you've not been affected. Thanks for the reply.

Hello people of reddit, I would strongly appreciate any advise regarding my situation.
I deposited into Bitfinex earlier this morning, but my coins never got loaded into the site - (5+ hours and 30+ confirmations on the transaction). The coins were never recognised by the Bitfinex system.
When I check the blockchain on the address itself, the coins are still within the deposit address, not moved, however, are they still vulnerable to being taken? Are they safe? Are they gone? Is the wallet gone?
I'm just lost at this stage as I know Bitfinex have introduced new signature signing methods with BitGo, so I have no idea whether my coins are safe of not.
Would appreciate any answers, thanks guys!
