Is it too late to get back in? Back then I didn't have all that much disposable income. What I did have went on video games and weed obviously. Now my situation is different and I could probably put away about £500. Is now a good time to invest?

I bet the guy who gave you the coins is kicking themselves too. Unless they're now living it up in a mansion somewhere

I just went through a list of popular mining pools and one of them rang a bell. I used Slushpool which is apparently one of the oldest ones. Then I went through the "forgot your password" rigamarole. Lo and behold, 0.007 bitcoins.

Cheers for the advice. Maybe I'll leave my computer mining Ethereum for a while and see if it goes anywhere while putting a bit for money into bitcoin every so often. Damn shame I didn't start doing this earlier.
Must be all that work business that kept me too busy to notice.

Yeah I tried a bit of mining but when I started it was too late. I just managed to log into my old account. Apparently I managed to mine 0.007 bitcoins. Nowhere near enough to cash out...

I did a lot of reading the second time I came across them. From what I could tell, they'll be massive if they become mainstream. Like if banks started using them for their transactions. If I did grab some now I definitely wouldn't offload them the moment my money doubles (if it does) it'd be for the long term. 
But from what I can see, bitcoin isn't the only player in the market anymore. I've read that Ethereum is like a newer, updated coin with similar technologies. 
Does bitcoin set itself apart in any way other than being first?
