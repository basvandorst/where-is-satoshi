Im a good cause.
Heres my address
This fund is used for showing people what bitcoin is and how to use it. I currently send my own bitcoin to literally random people to show them about bitcoin. Ive currently spent over $635 showing people bitcoin trying to spread the wealth and knowledge. I can even prove to any donators that I'm showing new people bitcoin and that your funds are going towards spreading the word on bitcoin. Ive never received or asked for funds but im all out of btc to share with people but still want to show people about bitcoin and the best way to give them free money lol.. thanks
