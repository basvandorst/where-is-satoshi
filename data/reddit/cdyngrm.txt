You don't actually lose or gain anything until the day you hit that sell button

This is exactly what I did. My mom asked me what bitcoin was and it was within a week that I sold very close to the all time high. I haven’t heard anyone mention bitcoin in about 6 months. I know this place will hate me for saying this but bitcoin isn’t going to see 20k....not in the next decade. Nobody is willing to get burned twice by it

If the “blue wave” is real I can guarantee the bull run will be over. I’ll be switching back to bitcoin if it looks like it will happen.

This place sounds more and more like a pyramid scheme salesmen every day

You are wasting your words on these people mate. They are victims and will always be victims.

Yes but your bitcoin will cost more and more to purchase items. You may still have .5 btc for example but what you can buy with that is dramatically more expensive as BTC tumbles all the way back down. It would be like living in post WW1 Germany that you have mountains of cash but it’s all worthless. How does this concept not get through to you people.

You want to know how I decided to not ever buy crypto currency again? When people around here started crying “whale manipulation” every time you guys bleed more from a gutter. Just look at the low volume. Look at the complexity. Everyday people have been pushed away from the crypto markets because it’s over saturated and filled with scam coins and confusion. When it was just Bitcoin and it seemed simple people were willing to try it. Now it seems like people won’t bother anymore. If it takes a techy to even remotely understand half this crap that means only techys will be participating. Vendors accept it here and there for purchases but usually through services that convert it at market value instantly to fiat currency. Bitcoin just does not seem feasible for everyday people...

I think I found another adopter who cash out mortgaged his house for bitcoin at the ATH 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:27:23
I’m no expert by any means but I got lucky as hell. Found out I had to move for my job and sold days before the ATH to have some financial security for the move out to California. I had ripple, BTC, xrp, and multiple cryptos that gained me a TON of money. I also thought it was a good time because my family started asking me about bitcoin and how to make money off of it and it started to feel like a pyramid scheme. Literally about 50% dumb luck. Haven’t touched it since.

Please tell me this is sarcasm. It’s going to be really awkward for the cashier when you purchase a cheap gun and only one bullet in a few months.

If bitcoin hits $2-$5 it’s hours away from being completely worthless.

If you do need the money in 6 months you are going to seriously regret your decision to store it in crypto as it bleeds and gushes value faster than any asset I have ever seen.

The delusion is real lately. Sold everything at 18k when I realized stupid money was flooding the market and even my grandparents learned about bitcoin. Very very few people adopted bitcoin because they believed in the technology, they purchased because they wanted to earn quick "real money." If I had my money in bitcoin still I honestly would sell right now no questions asked.

You don't actually lose anything until you sell. You still have the potential to lose 6 digits if you hang on long enough! ��

I would not in a million years jump back into an asset that dropped almost 70% in value in less than a year. If it can drop drastically from 19k to 6k in the blink of an eye then it is reasonable to assume a 6k investment could just as easily be worth 1k in another blink of the eye. It doesn't take a genius to smell the desperation around here. I would rather not join in with you all ;)

Maybe it hurt to look back in their post history and see "bitcoin to the moon HODL" and "just bought the dip at 16k"
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:02:05
The gravy train can derail friend and nobody loses or earns money until they sell or hit zero. Please don't have more invested then you're willing to lose. I recommend reading "a random walk down Wall Street," it's a great book with some insight into past hysteria around other bubble markets in history. What I learned from it is what helped me decide to sell at a decent profit. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:46:19
How retarted do you have to be to think anyone wants to buy into a worthless asset that has been doing a death spiral for a year. The “moon” already happened. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:26:07
.13 BTC is worth $97.37, but if you wait another year you can get .39 BTC for $33. Why stop there!! In two years you can get a WHOLE BITCOIN FOR $.50!!!

I already bought cheap in 2015 and got out of bitcoin a long time ago when the only reason people started using it was a “get rich quick” scheme. This sub started to sound like a pyramid scheme salesman. I’ll be back to remind you how stupid your assumption is in a few months. ✌️ 
Edit: this is coming from someone who was heavily invested in the idea of bitcoin that was bastardized by the stupid HODL morons. Public perception of bitcoin has been permanently tarnished. It’s a damn shame. We allowed hundreds of crap coins and shitty ICOs because everyone here was greedy and chasing money. Bitcoin was choked out and too many everyday people got burnt. Now we all sit around pretending like people want to go through that again? It’s not happening
