Why not the best ? I see it more user friendly , what do u think from ur experience?
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:21:18
Oh really ?why people still on gdax then if everyone is making -100% profit ,  jeeez 
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:41:18
But i have to trade with more capital to gain more , my strategy is like this , i buy and sell when i the profit is -20$-50$ so i have to buy more coins to gain more money , but i want to know if people here have alot of fiat on gdax , or im on risk of blocking my account and taking all the money im worked for it for years 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:32:14

@_date: 2018-01-16 12:42:59
Thank you bro
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:37:50
I tried today , i bought one btc and sold it after few hours and i made 300$ , what you call this ? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:42:03
So actually is like buying and selling to other people  , i tough its like trading eur/usd on forex , on forex you can lose your money when you trade but from what I understand from you thaton bitcoin the only risk is when the real price of the bitcoin drops !  Thank you i really appreciate your help

Exchange is very risky for somone like me
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:27:36
Im a heavy trader , daily trades in bitcoins , what is the best for me ? When it comes to fees ? Volume...?
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:49:53
Thats what im doing exactly , my eur wallet is getting bigger when i sell my coins , do you think they will not block my account snd steal my money ? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:47:07
People make money buy trading not holding until you are 40 years old and sell lol , make profit and enjoy it when you are young , good luck holding that shit 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:38:56
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:29:24
Please explain me something, can i hold bitcoin on gdax and sold it whenever i want or o can only use it with realtime trading wich is so risky . Thank you buddy
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:30:10
So when i sell there is no risk to lose all my bitcoin ? Its not like forex right ?
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:30:21
Seriously, hahahahahah
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:38:34
Lets all do it guys , stop being a brave  behind your phones and just do it ��
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:28:51
We are all on this together,  im sure its a good decision!
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:16:47
After buying from localbitcoin , they will send it to my Coinbase wallet ?  Or localbitcoin has its own wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:33:31
You mean to buy now ?
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:21:07
Gdex for trading and coinbase only for holding right sir ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:47:44
Gdax only for trading right ? I want to buy and hold for long term but im scared if i will sell i will face a huge fee
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:34:13
Im going to start with 10$k and hodl it for long whatever happened, and also im going to invest 500 $ in gdax to learn how to exchange . I do live in europe and i laready verified my Coinbase account
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:50:44

Copy past queen
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:51:21
Even if whales will sell out everything and the price will drop we will keep it alive , the bitcoin itself will never die ,  its a cricle with or without whales to the moon
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:13:48
Pro tip : if you are able to hold all your money in bitcoin then hell yeah , if you want to invest to make profit fast believe me you gonna regret it , price can go up and down in short term but for long term its a good investment.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:15:30
You will not sleep in street if you wast 1 dollar
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:23:18
Stop scaring people .  
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:26:08
Its not a probleme if i dont know . I want to learn . Can u explain to me if you dont mind . Anyway thank you for the reply
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:24:37
Coinbase is shit and gdax are shiit , u can lie to yourself and say i had no problem with them , when u will have an issue there is no body to help you out there , a company who cares only about ur money , staaaaay away people just staay away
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:08:47
Is there any way to make it automatic , like you said placing orders to sell high ! Ik on gdax , thx broo
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:28:22
Gold info .
Question :
, i i run full node can i use my own node to send and receive transaction . 
Those server on electrum are from the electrum itself or random node from normal people ? 
I just want to eliminate any third party to handle my transaction . 
Thank you again for your help
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:09:55
I think you missed the question 
Im asking if i can send from A to B without using a third party like coinbase or blockchain .  Even by ledger if you send money it goes under the ledger server so all your transactions can be saved out there including your ip and the ledger owner ...
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:23:25
As i told you , 11,5 today , it will dip few hours no body can tell exactly when but it will go up to 12.1 by tomorrow .

@_date: 2018-02-26 18:15:48
Yep i do the same except sometime you buy and the price drops alooot so you finish holding or selling wih lose
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:24:09
It will take time to get there , but for sure it will be there oneday :)
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:00:03
Dont follow what he says , real traders who makes alot of money dosent have time to do YouTube videos . Or evwn interested about yt money

@_date: 2018-02-15 18:11:14
30$k , but its not on gdax im trying to figure out wich exchange is better for me
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:56:57
Never regret when you sell with profit , because you will regret when the price goes down , i sold at 10,944  and i did the right thing
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:45:19
Fight with profit taker and market mouvment , no body can tell you what is going to happen in the next hours
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:49:48
There is two probleme
First one you need aloot of money to make profit min 1 btc
Second problem if you buy low and you want to sell high but the price went soo down and we saw that many time you will be stucked at higher price then you have to sell with lose or wait daaays or weeks or .. to sell high again , so you will end just by holding not trading , but if you got alot of money you can play around 
Its not as easy as you think it can work for few times but not for long term
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:12:29
Thats what i was thinking . I think paper wallet is safest way to stay anonym after mixing the btc and send them to different. I dont trust no company . Cheers
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:51:55
Be  patient and dont freak out

Im trading now bro , but i have no idea . I just buy when i see the price looks good , most of the times ot goes more below the price i bought for , and im still making alot of mistake like buying the peak ....
