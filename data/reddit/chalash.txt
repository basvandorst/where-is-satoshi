We've seen reports of the scam wallets sending funds out of the wallet  once it has been loaded with a sufficient number of coins. Not sure of the threshold but we are guessing it's around 1 BTC. The wallet then gives a phony [error message]( and locks down. Only once people try and load their passphrase in another device do they see that the funds are gone.  
  
All of these breadwallet clones have appeared within the last 5 days. All look the same with slight modifications, and all have enough commonality that we can assume it's the same malicious actor. It's not enough evidence to convict these people in court. But it's enough evidence to warn unsuspecting people who go to the App store looking for a bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:29:04
It's definitely a scam. I work for breadwallet and we've downloaded the app and checked it ourselves - it's a re-skinned version of breadwallet like the scam apps that are known to be stealing people's money.

I can see that you greatly dislike bitcoin. I feel the same way about fiat currency. Fortunately for you, nobody will ever force you to use bitcoin.  
  
Your frequent use of the word rentier class and obvious distaste for those who live off of society without contributing makes me wonder why you stick up so vehemently for the state. I'm not sure how you can look at the state and not see a massive blob of waste, theft, and non contribution.

If I grant you any credit to the state's for prosperity, then it's a purse filled with the sweat of private individuals. At best you can claim that the government is a good asset allocator, but that's a questionable statement. 
  
If you don't think that savers should be rewarded for sparing the world's time and energy on fulfilling frivolous expenditures, then perhaps you don't believe that an individual should be able to achieve financial freedom through accumulating a sufficient amount of money. This would be advocating your own version of "slavery" and disrespecting the same laborers that you claim Bitcoin holds in disdain. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 11:04:14
Just because somebody else benefits from your efforts doesn't mean that you have been exploited. By your logic every technological leap that empowered millions of other people is somehow an ethical slight, and light bulbs are just an enabler of the idle class.

Unlike dollars bitcoin is not born as a loan. It's by nature non-usurious and solves exactly that problem. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 13:43:30
To be an effective means of exchange, money must also serve as a store of value. Money is an abstraction that developed in the market place, not something that creates wealth.  
  
We are in complete agreement that human labor is the genesis of all value. However, you still need a way to lock that value safely until such time as you decide to exchange it for the results of somebody else's labor. Bitcoin is (arguably) a fairer and more equitable form of money than dollars, euros, or yen.

In addition, there is nothing de facto wrong about labor costs going down. If your cost of living is dropping faster than your nominal wage drop, you are still getting an effective pay raise. Likewise, today, a pay raise does you no good unless it is in excess of the increasing cost of living.

Hi there. If you are interested, Bread isn't dragging its feet to make any kind of point. The concern is that as an SPV wallet, adding an additional address chain to the look-ups can double the syncing time (which is already pretty annoying). If we were to optimize properly by using Bech32, it would then require 3 address chains, which quickly becomes untenable. The best solution to keep the app light weight and take advantage of the best optimizations might be to skip the P2SH format altogether. Hope that helps shed a little light on the situation.
@_date: 2016-04-05 13:30:31
I think you are conflating money with loans. Holding bitcoin is neither risk free, nor does it afford you any compound interest. 
  
I suspect that we may have similar visions for what a fair society would look like, but we are too ideologically distant to agree on how to achieve it.  
  
Grinding out a life is an unfortunate human reality. Personally, I would rather be grinding out my time in exchange for an appreciating currency than a depreciating currency. And the amount of risk I wish to assume after that is my business.  
  
With fiat currency that becomes less valuable every day, simple savers like myself are pushed into poor risk-adjusted investments. A mature bitcoin can offer a viable alternative to the two imperfect choices we have today. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:24:15
We will. The hold up is being careful we don’t overload the abilities of a pure SPV wallet. Because Bread pings the bitcoin network directly, it takes a long time to sync, which is annoying but a trade off to maintain privacy. Adding additional address chains will have a negative impact on the syncing time, so we want to get it right the first time, since the solution has to be backwards compatible forever. 
  
We actually heard a pretty slick recommendation from u/uninterestedbarber on reddit and are excitedly mapping out how we might be able to take advantage of his idea.

Hi there. Your point is well taken. We had to hunker down for a while to compete our token sale. And I know a lot of our users feel that we haven’t been giving them sufficient attention - they are right. 
  
Considering that we now have the resources to deliver on pretty much anything, we really don’t have any excuse to let you down. I hope you’ll stick around or at least keep us on your radar in 2018. You might be pleasantly surprised by what we have in store. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:08:35
Oh, yeah and we have like a dozen bug fixes to get through first. That’s actually top priority right now and lots of those frustrations should be addressed in an upcoming release. Sorry it’s taken so long - I swear everybody on the team has been burning the midnight oil for months despite how it looks. 
  
That said, I’m glad you reminded me about the subreddit. It needs a lot more love!
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:26:37


  
This is one of my biggest concerns. And clearly we haven’t been communicating effectively about why we haven’t launched Segwit support yet. For that reason we are going to dedicate a lengthy and technical post about what it means to implement segwit in an SPV wallet the right way. This is an architectural upgrade. If it were as simple as flicking a switch, we would have done it already. But it’s not, and no offence intended to people who loudly demand it - many of them have no idea what is actually required, and what considerations and design trade offs must be weighed. It kills me inside when I hear people saying that we simply don’t care, or have some ulterior agenda. It’s just not true. 
  


  
Bit of a chicken and an egg problem here. Everybody wants a great wallet but nobody is willing to pay for one. The resources required to really excel simply didn’t exist. That is, until the token sale. Now we have enough to do everything we ever dreamed - everything people have been asking for. What’s more, operating at scale will unlock the holy grail of wallets: achieving profitability and a sustainable business model. Our whole team is old school bitcoiners. Nothing would please us more than to be welcomed back into the arms of our brethren who thought we had abandoned them. 
  


  
My personal thought is that BCH is good for bitcoin because it’ll force quicker development and adoption of L2 solutions. It’s healthy competition in one of the few remaining free markets. Honestly I don’t know how time-dependent the path to securing the crypto throne is. Can bitcoin remain king with lightning rolling out in 18 months? I expect so. If it takes 5 years? I doubt it. 
  
Trustless tabs on the lightning network would be soooooo nice. I would definitely chuck most of my bitcoin into a channel. Full blown though we’re going to need bigger blocks, even if the settlement layer is 100% channel openings/closings. But I think many of the core devs are in agreement on this and we will cross that bridge when we get there. Anyway, I’m rambling a bit but I hope that answers your question. Let me know if you have any more. I could spitball all day. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:00:10
Sure. First, we have some catch up to do launching full support for Segwit and BCH, as we promosed. Second, our token functions as a rewards system in the app, so we’re going to be able to start treating loyal customers to perks like traditional companies do, I.e. direct phone support or 5 free transactions per month, etc. 
  
In addition, we have a roadmap for 2018 that can be found in our whitepaper at  (not sure if mods will allow me posting the token site but I’m just trying to answer your question. u/bashco, if you want me to nix that part please just let me know - I want to be sensitive to the rules). Many of our hardcore bitcoin users aren’t interested in the multi-currency and exchange functonalities we will roll out, but for those who are, that’s going to be a big component. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:35:13
It’s been really weird to witness. Anybody who knows our team personally understands that we’re just a bunch of bitcoin nerds with big dreams who are doing the best we can. Watching the public narrative get out of our control and take on a life of its own has been a bit of an unsettling experience.

That’s an interesting approach. Let me think about that and discuss with the team.

Yeah, that was an interesting figure, along with all of the land that the government owns.  
  
I'm not sure how to contextualize the assets, but I do know one thing. If the government holds $150T of *anything* then they are getting a terrible return. If you gave me $150T worth of assets I'd just turn the government into a passive index fund paying out $5T a year to its citizens.
@_date: 2015-12-11 14:36:13
Very interesting.  
  
I wonder if it is possible, in principle, to create a time-locked transaction for 150 years hence, with an executing smart contract contingent on matching at least ~2% of your DNA - i.e. only a great-great-great-great-great-grandchild could access the coins.  
  
I can imagine lots of technical issues... lots.  But it's a fun thought experiment. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 17:40:50


  
It's not precisely a government creation. To pay for operations, the US Gov has to use tax revenue and then supplement it by borrowing money in the form of US treasuries, which it sells institutional buyers but also the Fed.  
  
It is from the Fed, a pseudo-private hybrid bank that new money springs into existence, and always in the form of debt (unless it increases base money). But the Fed isn't even responsible for most of the currency in existence. For that we can thank bank credit, which dwarfs the amount created through treasury auctions.  
  
I agree with much of what you are saying, but the US Gov can't just snap its fingers to create money. It has to do it in a convoluted and expensive matter.

Aren't you publicly operating at Lättichstrasse 1, 6340 Baar, Switzerland? Even so, there is no need to show any outdoor photos.  
  


  
No need to show where the key safe is.  
  


  
Why is this a problem? I would be concerned if you were relying somehow on your manufacturer to keep private keys safe.  
  


  
Trade secrets are certainly worth protecting, so no argument there. No need to show the trade secrets.  
  


  
To gain the trust of your customers. For instance, it is a lot easier to make a list of your procedures than to actually follow them. Knowing that you actually are in possession of a printer which covers the private key with the non scratch layer as part of the printing process would make me much more likely to trust and recommend your company.  
  
In my opinion the easiest attack vector would be for your employees to collude in taking discreet photos of all private keys getting printed, and so some assurance that your private keys never see the light of day, not even from a shallow angle, would be in order. Personally, I believe this is the most relevant claim that you have made which would benefit from such confirmation.  
  
It isn't much effort. Literally just taking a photo of the printer.

I think their infographic is slightly incorrect. The way they have worded it, it sounds as if each transaction in itself is a "block," or somehow configured into a block shape (digitally?) before being broadcast.  
  
Blocks are discrete groups of transactions that allow for settling and ordering consensus across the network. Not to nitpick, but it's an important detail.
@_date: 2015-12-11 14:42:22
Surely, you could provide more proof than "it wouldn't be in our interest to steal some coins."  
  
What about your employees? How do you avoid collusion between two of them to take photos of private keys?  
  
You would have a very large incentive to store private keys because a) If your business becomes very successful, you'll never need to steal bitcoins, and will appear to be a valid and successful entrepreneur, and b) If your business performs poorly, you can cease operations and monitor all of the addresses for which you have the private keys, deciding if and when to steal them, and c) If the coins are stolen, yes your business is toast, but you personally can claim ignorance for how they were stolen, reducing legal accountability.

Sure there is! I just made it for you above. You may have to parse it out a bit, but it makes sense. If you are having trouble understanding it, let me know and I can clarify it. 
  
But to my point, it stands to reason that fewer people will mine if their electricity costs exceed the block reward + fees and more people will mine if their electricity costs are less than the block reward + fees. This is the convergence I reference.  
  
To be more blunt, if ASIC chips suddenly become 10x more efficient, then there will eventually be 10x more ASIC chips running on the network, using up the same amount of energy as before. Efficiency does not equal "environmentally friendly." That was my point.

Just because you can create loans in excess of the number of coins doesn't mean that this is fractional reserve banking. The loans themselves must be as good as money, and indistinguishable from it. In your scenario the loans are just a promise to pay bitcoin. In the current system, a loan is both a promise to pay currency and currency itself.

Not a bad way to put it, but this only addresses differences in opinion for what *should* happen, rather than the ongoing and, in my opinion, more common disagreements behind what "would* happen in the event of certain protocol changes.

I question that statement, unless he means it would be the case *without raising the block limit*

It most certainly does. Private assets do *not* belong to the government and should not be included on its balance sheet.  
  


  
Good luck selling that with oil below $40 per barrel. If it were to be liquidated, it would be at a small fraction of that figure.
  


  
The social security trust fund is a liability upon the US taxpayer, which defeats the point of being able to sell it for a net benefit to the US taxpayer.  
  


  
This is enough to not take the author seriously. It's his article and he is too "lazy" to do his own calculations.  
  


  
One major reason that people worry about the government being insolvent is that it means they will likely be taxed more. By essentially claiming that the government owns you and therefor it won't ever be insolvent, the author ignores the whole point. What good is a solvent government if you must give 100% of your wealth to keep it that way?  
  
In closing, the issue isn't simply one of assets and liabilities, it also has to do with the amount of money in the economy. Large amounts of debt can cause bankruptcies in the general economy, which actually destroys currency. There is a technical nature to the insolvency which is not addressed in this article. When money disappears, nobody can pay for *anything* including the government.

@_date: 2015-06-11 17:38:38
Didn't watch the video, but it won't be done for a couple of reasons.  
  
1) Money is debt. If they cancel all debts, they will also empty your bank accounts.  
  
2) Debts have creditors. If all debts are cancelled, creditors get wiped out, and the biggest creditors to US debt are those who rely on entitlements like medicare, medicaid, and social security.  
  
Now, that is not to say that *can't* be done - just that it won't.

It's expensive because it is borrowed. Once the government spends $1T of new money, it still has to tax citizens to roll over or pay down the capital, with interest. If the government were to simply print it's own money, it could spend it, and then that would be the end of the obligation.

One last question. Why is this? If your procedures are sound, then what would be the potential attack vector that this would create?

Clearly, if there is a bridge to be built, then somebody knows how to build it. And this somebody will be a private company. So the question is not one of expertise, but rather of how to pay this company.  
  


  
This is a tautology. Obviously you need a government to build a government owned project, otherwise it wouldn't be a government owned project.  
  


  
Having the government negotiate between jurisdictions may have its advantages, but "jurisdictional heterogeneity" doesn't preclude private companies negotiating on behalf of the project and paying a fair price for commercial use of somebody else's land.

Hi there. We’re trying to leapfrog P2SH and go straight to bech32 (about a 10% efficiency improvement). The app connects directly to the bitcoin network so once we monitor a new derivation address chain we have to forever. Trying to keep it to 2 instead of 3 BTC chains. Also need to make it easy enough so that newbies can’t get confused or make mistakes. Also, I’m sorry it’s taking so long. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:32:42
One issue I could see would be that if the hash rate went down because of a price drop, and the block reward was decreased per your subscription, that miners would stop mining because it wasn't profitable for them to do so anymore.  
  
This would cause the hash rate to go down even more, and miners to drop our even more. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the hash rate decreasing today is part of a negative feedback system, where miners are incentivized to join or quit depending on the difficulty vs. the price. It's the interplay between the two that keeps the system humming. If we were to introduce a connection between hash rate and block reward, you get a double whammy, and a positive feedback loop trending towards a less secure network.  
  
Interesting food for thought, though. $2 @_date: 2014-07-10 19:43:26

Yes, certainly. The most popular will be "secret sharing" in which you split your private key like a horcrux and give out the pieces to your family. Say you make 7, at least 4 of them will have to band together to move your coins.  
 
You can also conceivably put a script on your coins so that only 10% can be moved per day without your master key, allowing you to minimize the damage in the event of your family trying to rip you off. This part is a little more complicated, but that's the gist of it.

Before I was halfway through reading this I could tell the author was Tim Swanson. He always brings good solid academic thinking to his arguments, even though I often disagree with his conclusions.  
  
In this case, he's probably right that banks don't really need bitcoin. Some kind of semi-decentralized SWIFT network, enforced by law, would probably suffice.

You've cited an article from the CAP, which has a distinct liberal bias. I can [also cite reliable sources on the topic](  
  
The minimum wage is not a panacea. It has benefits and costs. The benefits are mostly to large conglomerates such as McDonald's who can afford to pay workers slightly more. The losers are small businesses and low-skilled workers.

I think that history tells a different story. For example, Ford's famous $5 per hour wage hike, in the absence of legislation, showed that greedy capitalists will raise the wages of their workers if it benefits them; in this case, by reducing turnover, and increasing morale.  
  
Obviously, employers will try to get the best deal for their business costs. Employees are a cost just like any other overhead: electricity, insurance, transportation, etc. This fact will never change. Companies survive and thrive by turning a profit, which is indicative of the wealth they have created for their society, and not the exploitation of their workers, as many would like to argue.  
  
If you think that minimum wage laws are what took our country from poor with low working standards, to fabulously rich where even the most impoverished still have a TV and probably an air conditioner, then I'll have to strongly disagree. At the early stages of industrialization, the only thing which can bootstrap an economy from poor to prosperous is capital accumulation. Working, building, inventing, saving, and investing for the future. To your claim that the minimum wage even contributed to increased working pay and standards, I would reply that things were already getting better anyway.  
  
Simply mandating that a business should pay its workers more is short sighted, and assumes that all businesses can afford "a little bit more." Even if they can, a little bit more might be enough to make a person more expensive than a computer terminal at the fast food restaurant. So if Wendy's replaces all of its tellers with touchscreen order kiosks, who is to blame? I would blame the "morally superior" legislators of the minimum wage hike and their supporters, rather than the rational businessmen and women who's job it is to run their company profitably.
  
You make an important reference to what could be called a "sweatshop." I understand that most people think they are categorically bad, but [sometimes it's helpful to get another perspective.](

Don't worry, I'm not down voting you. In fact I've upvoted you. This is a worthwhile discussion. The reason that they wouldn't turn off their rigs is that they know their only salvation is to power through to the lower difficulty adjustments, which won't take that long. If everybody shut off their rigs, and the network ground to a halt, people would begin mining again just to keep the network alive, knowing that their entire investment depends on Bitcoin being a viable currency. After a couple weeks, the block rate would speed up a bit, and after another, it would do so again. Within 2 months, we'd be back to 1 block every 10 minutes.  
  
But taking an apocalyptic view: if everybody simply stopped mining altogether and refused to turn their rigs on again, you would see a frazzled dev party where they would update the current version of Bitcoin-QT, resetting the difficulty at half the previous hash rate. It wouldn't be comfortable, but it would work, and it would definitely happen.

No particular source. Just lots of general head nodding over the years from some of the devs that the limit will have to change eventually, and that satoshi only included it to protect the block chain from bloat during the bootstrapping phase. Of course it's possible that once we bump up against the cap on a regular basis, that other off-chain services will provide a relief valve, and that the block chain will just be a settlement ledger. But I would be surprised if the limit weren't raised even a little bit.

If you import a private key into blockchain.info that has an associated public address with coins in it, it will instantly show that balance.  
  
Because of the bitcoin blockchain (which is "everywhere" all the time), it doesn't really matter whether you are interacting with it from a phone, computer, or web-browser. All that matters is whether you have sent coins to another address. So the fact that your Bitcoin-QT wallet hasn't synced yet has no effect whatsoever on the balance of the address to which you sent the coins. The coins are there waiting for you.

Unfortunately, to be truly unique, your crypto currency will need to accomplish at least one of the following:  
  
A) extremely efficient (from an environmemtal point of view) transaction verification.  
  
B) extremely compressed transaction history.  
  
C) extremely scalable transaction volume capability.

To be expected of course since there is a hard limit on the number of bitcoins. For instance, on the exchanges, you will never ever see more than a few 10's of thousands of bitcoin available to be sold, regardless of the price. You might very well say that market depth has been stagnant, but it doesn't paint the whole story.  
  
Also, maybe you're right and this whole thing is a fantasy which crumbles to the ground. I think you overestimate how much bitcoiners really care about this. For many, that we've come this far is enough to marvel at, and while losing money doesn't make anybody happy, I think most bitcoiners know the risks involved, and won't be entirely shocked if something doesn't work out as planned.

Hi witcoins. Good to see you.  
  
I understand deflation perfectly well, and would be happy to discuss it further with you. In this particular case, I believe you have failed to understand my use of the term analogy, which refers to a structural comparison between two examples.  
  
It is obvious to everybody else in this thread what I meant when I made the claim that people are willing to spend now rather than wait and get something more cheaply. You rightfully point out that this is often due to irresponsibility. Whether its irresponsibility, incentives, necessity, or just human nature, people spend money. These are the same people who you are curiously expecting to hold onto a strong currency that is appreciating at 5% per year instead of taking their friends out to dinner.  
  
You are not the only person with opposing views. There are many thoughtful and polite people here who might challenge the example I gave, and I would welcome that discussion. I welcome your input too, since I have thick skin and your profanity doesn't bother me.

Well, first off, if you have an education in working hard, then you're doing better than most people. You can spend hours on YouTube hearing about the plight of people who went to respectable universities, only to graduate with zero job prospects, other than as a barista, and $100k+ in student loan debt. So in my book, you've got plenty of credibility.  
  
What you described in the second paragraph is spot on. Keeping your own stash at the same level, while spending bitcoins, has a net-zero effect on price (since the amount you are supplying and demanding is equal), but a net-positive affect on uptake, since you are expanding the network of bitcoin transactions.  
  
My point was that it is important to acknowledge the role of saving (hoarding) in the economy. The reality is that saving has a set of very positive effects: It decreases the supply of bitcoins, making them more valuable for everybody else, it generates more trust, as others see that people are willing to hold large amount of their personal wealth in magical internet space bucks, and it allows the accumulation of capital, which can be borrowed or spent at some point in the future, sacrificing consumption today for the promise of greater consumption tomorrow.  
  
If you want to engage in a large capital expenditure, such as building a new high rise, then somebody has to save the money first (at least in theory. It's not really the case with fractional reserve banking, but let's ignore that for a moment). Often this takes time, and seems pointless. Why would somebody just stack gold bars over the course of 40 years?  
  
Again, with your second paragraph, I don't think we are actually in much disagreement. I've been buying, saving, investing, and spending bitcoins for a long time. My only point was to give the savers a little love, since they are the ones who beef up the value of everybody else's coins, paving the way for larger purchases in the future.

McAfee said the same thing. When will people learn that the price of BTC has (almost*) nothing to do with mining?  
  
*There is some evidence that during price runs miners hodl more BTC from what they earned. But this is dubious at best - miners are just as likely to spedn the excess profit on more equipment. 
@_date: 2014-09-01 13:27:30
Definitely. Random sequences look more unlikely than human made sequences. For instance, if you flip a coin 100 times, there is a super high chance you will get 5 of the same in a row at some point, and it is likely that you will get 6 in a row. But if you ask somebody to "pretend" that they are flipping a coin and randomly choose 100 heads or tails, they will almost never log more than 3 in a row, feeling that it might not look "random" enough.
EDIT: thanks for the gold, stranger!
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:30:35
You ignore the fact that your opponent can also put $500 into Bitcoin, which hedges his risk. He either gains or loses $500, depending on the price at the expiration time.
  
I agree, however, that the higher the price is from the current price, the more the bet should be discounted from his end. A smart person would demand asymmetric odds, for instance, I would consider taking a 2:1 bet that Bitcoin is above $700 in 3 months. If I'm right, I earn $500 from you. If you are right, you earn $250 from me.  
  
So yeah, it's a dumb bet for your opponent to take, but I just wanted to add some thoughts.  
  
EDIT: There are lots of examples in the real world for how people make this same mistake. I recall once seeing something about a guy at a horse track who would offer other betters some sort of deal, which seemed like a great idea, but under the hood was a similar riskless proposition for the originator. If anybody knows the name of this fallacy or can find and example I would be grateful.

I think we're probably down to semantics anyway. I'll cede to you that the modern definition of inflation tends to focus on price increases, but that the original definition specifically refers to an increase in the money supply.  
  
Bitcoin may indeed go to zero, but it won't be because of a rapid expansion in its supply. Could we agree on that?

Also, because he assumed that a "perfect" future was being priced in, when Bitcoin was going to inevitably fall short.

The price of a bitcoin is determined on the open-market, which is where buyers and sellers meet. Depending on whether demand is outstripping supply or vice-versa, the price will go up or down.  
  
Much of the downward pressure is from merchants who accept bitcoin, who then convert it immediately to dollars. If people are spending bitcoin in this manner at a rate which outpaces that of people who are purchasing bitcoin, then the price goes down.  
  
Price goes up, price goes down. Welcome to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:01:50

Certainly. The concept is scalable to pretty much any financial instrument. If a liability is entered into the balance sheet, it will have a corresponding asset, in general, unless it is not collateralized. Applying cryptographic proof would be trivial to the entire accounting process.

Edit2: Wallets such as Bitcoin-QT, Electrum, and blockchain.info are able to manage multiple "addresses" for you. Sometimes there is confusion, for instance people talk about "paper wallets," but really they are "paper addresses." Wallets tend to provide functionality for the user, whereas addresses simply store the funds.

If you look at the bitcoin subreddit over the last week, you'll see a lot of anger towards Ghash for allowing themselves to grow above 50% of the network mining power. The reason that this is a problem is because somebody with that much mining capacity has the ability, in theory, to control which transactions do and don't go through.

Every public key has many many many associated private keys, but because hashing is a trap-door function, you'll never be able to figure out what they are.  
  
The only way to know a private key is to create one first, and then use it to generate the public key and associated address. Any validly created address will have a checksum that says "I'm valid!" as a way to make it tough to mistype one character and send coins to an address which nobody controls. That said, it's easy to manufacture a checksum so that an address *looks* like it was created from a private key, even though it wasn't.  
  
Hope that helps...

3) Credit card companies will incorporate Bitcoin to reduce their own frictional costs, which creates greater demand for Bitcoin.

I always get a kick out of securing private keys. It's really hard to be your own bank. The basic equation is a tradeoff between the risk that your coins will be stolen, and the risk that you will lose the private keys.  
  
It's really hard! Personally, I've spent a lot of time making sure that if I die, that my coins can be retrieved by my family. But every effort to make them more accessible makes them more vulnerable to theft.  
  
The problem with bipxx is that you still have the store the password, which is a something of a private key too. Where should you keep it? It's a hard/fun problem.  
  
Sorry to not really answer your question. Basically, don't keep it in a hot wallet. That's all I can recommend.

Mining is a tough game to play successfully. The people who can do it profitably have relationships with the large mining manufacturers like KnC, and can buy in bulk because they spend 6 or 7 figures at a time.

So after a brief look through the comments, I was surprised that nobody pointed out the authors' obvious misunderstanding about how the issuance of Bitcoin is determined. They seem to believe that some amount of trust is necessary; that a small group of private individuals won't abuse their issuing power, when the hard-limit on Bitcoin is so systemically entrenched as to be close to impossible to change at this point.

Agreed, it's not a panacea. But a private rating agency has much more incentive to be right ( I.e. the better business bureau) than a public entity. There will always be fraud and theft.  
  
When it comes to cajoling, if you recall, Moody's got an earful for taking us tbills down a notch. It was too little too late, but at least they had the guts to do it. 
  
At the end of the day, individuals have to decide who they trust. Typically, for reasons I can't understand, this trust is deposited in government institutions. I don't think these institutions are intentionally bad, just practically so.
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:19:31


  
Fine, but it may be the most relevant point. You rightly claim that the average person barely understands the dollar. But if it starts misbehaving in the near future, as many an-cap Austrians expect, people will be forced to care about the currency they use.  
  
It's been a relatively uneventful 70+ years in the US from a monetary standpoint. A little but of stagflation here, a little bit of gold de-linking there, a bubble pop every now and then... but this relative stability is completely abnormal for a paper currency from a historical standpoint. Just give it a few more years, we're probably almost there.
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:39:18
Maybe. We don’t get many support requests about mid-written paper keys, but when we do they fall into one of two categories: missing word, or invalid word. In both cases the tool recovers the original 12 words. In the future we’re going to offer an encrypted key escrow service so people don’t even need to write down the words in the first place. Hopefully that will help. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:48:29
Up until about 40 years ago, gold and silver were considered money globally, and for the last 5,000 years. Government imposed fiat systems have a pretty bad track record of surviving over the long term. I do agree that governments making rules about which money they will accept and enforce can have an effect on the value of the currency they issue, but I disagree that this is a necessary condition, and would go so far as to say it typically sows the seeds for monetary pain later on.

In addition, I would argue that hoarding is part of the use-case for currencies, at least it used to be for most of history. Gold is the hoardiest of hordables, creates no cash flow, and still is worth around $8T. Perhaps this counterexample is more to your liking.

It does, and it would, if it didn't suffer from capital controls just like other fiat currencies.  
  
For a good example of how a currency might supplant other currencies, take a look at the Petrodollar, which created virtually unlimited demand for dollars back in the 1970's.  
  
Subsequently, the entire world continued the adoption of US dollars as their reserve currency of choice, so I do believe that adoption very much falls in line with demand.  
  
Just because something is 100% adopted doesn't mean that a new played can't rise purely out of demand. The US has already "adopted" automobiles to pretty much a saturation point, and yet Tesla came on the scene, and did a great job taking a bite out of the market.  
  
Similarly to when somebody adopts a Tesla, they replace or discard their previous car. So it goes with currency. If Bitcoin is better, and people want it, they will ditch (exchange) their current money for bitcoin.

A Ponzi scheme is quite different. It necessitates a person to facilitate the scheme. One must promise outsized investment returns, but then pay the returns with new investor money. There is no actual investment. Bitcoin is no more a Ponzi scheme than gold.  
  
And for the OP, yes US Treasuries are a massive Ponzi scheme. Everybody knows that. But the reason people invest in a Ponzi scheme that they know to be a Ponzi scheme is because they think they can get out before the whole thing tumbles under its own weight.

Unfortunately, for the signed message, WF will have to take your digital signature, and verify that you created it with the private key associated with your addresses. In short, they would need to learn about as much as you would to verify the signatures.  
  
A message, as you called it, on the other hand, allows you to embed short strings with transactions. If you are going to make a transaction, you might as well just tell WF you'll send 0.01 BTC from address A to address B, and then show them this transaction using Blockchain.info (With the digital signatures, you don't actually make a transaction, you just create proof that you have control of the addresses.)

But in your analogy the pudding snacks aren't scarce. Bitcoin is scarce. Also you say that the problem is that there isn't much to buy, which is a different problem than currency hoarding. 
Yes, people hoarding (saving) money makes it more valuable. But when it becomes more valuable then they will spend it because their purchasing power increased. I don't think there is a single historical example of money failing because of hoarding.

All of my cold storage coins are kept in offline encrypted backups.  
  
They are also generated from a 200+ character brain wallet phrase, which I have managed to remember for over 2 years now.  
  
Belts and suspenders! I think sufficiently entropic brain wallets are great, as are encrypted backups. I can lose one or the other and still be able to access my coins, yet the existence of both doesn't significantly raise my risk of coin theft.
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:28:59
It might be, but I'm not so sure. First, you would have to define what is "reasonable," which will vary greatly depending on your geography. For instance, is it reasonable to strive for enough wealth to have refrigerator and air conditioning? 
  
Second, there might even be something "hyper social" about gaining and preserving wealth, because as long as you're not stealing it, you're probably earning it through engaging in trade with others, an act that benefits both parties.  
  
But yeah, worth debating I suppose.
@_date: 2014-09-09 18:23:00
This is why I disagree with those who say the real value is in the payment system. In reality, Bitcoin is comparatively expensive to maintain. Centralization has the benefit of only having to maintain one ledger. It's major value is the currency itself, most importantly its limited supply.
  
But fear not. We'll see Bitcoin shine after a few rounds of sovereign debt crises over the next decade. Less sexy than Apple Pay, but also much more significant in the long run.
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:11:32
It does, which would indicate it is controlled by a company (i.e. coinbase), which shifts coins around to ensure they keep most of them in cold storage.

Volatility is not only a function of total valuation, but also derivative and debt markets. The reason that the USD is relatively non-volatile has a lot to do with the fact that there exist trillions of dollars of ongoing long-term liabilities, which create a cushioned floor on dollar prices.  
  
You make some good points, but remember that lack of volatility does come at a cost. I would be more interested in hearing your analysis on Bitcoin as a potential store of value.

It's actually a pretty good presentation. He doesn't really have any bad information, just a different set of conclusions.  
  
For those who TL;DW, the guy understands Bitcoin and how disruptive it would be if it gained traction, but thinks it never will because it won't get government support. Also, it's from over two years ago, so I'm sure he has more to say about it today.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:58:13
Surely the rate at which Bitcoins are being lost is negligible at this point. In the early days, many were lost due to carelessness, but mostly it was because they weren't very valuable. These days the "attrition rate" is probably a fraction of a percent. So I don't necessarily agree that we're on any kind of meaningful path towards zero.  
  
And even if we approached a ridiculously small amount, say 1BTC globally, it would still be sufficient to facilitate any level of trade. All you have to do is use smaller denominations.  
  
Third, what benefit do you see by replacing the dollars lost? Surely they don't go to the man who burned them, so who gets the new dollars?

That would put the total market valuation of Bitcoin at $21 quadrillion. Considering the entire wealth of the world is estimated at $0.25 quadrillion, I believe that this young man has succumbed to hyperbole.

@_date: 2014-07-31 16:00:39
Hats off to you, brother.
@_date: 2014-10-20 17:51:54


  
Yes. We have many precedents for this, most recently, countries which adopted the USD at their de facto national currency, following a period of merchant rejection of the local currency. Rather than reject it outright, they simply discounted the USD price, as USD was perceived as more trustworthy and stable (rightfully).  
  
I keep an open mind with all things Bitcoin, so I'm not necessarily opposed to this view. However, I would want some further clarification, and a few things are not touched on:  
  
1) The author expects a 1, 2 punch from both the faultiness of fiat currencies and the power of Bitcoin. But frankly I'm not totally convinced. After terrible hyper-inflations in the past (and typically, they take between 5-20 years to clear through, just as an aside), gold and silver reemerged as a currency immediately following the collapse phase (the one where the currency becomes more useful for burning for heat than for buying bread). My question would be: what makes Bitcoin different than gold when compared to a failing fiat currency? Perhaps it is just that Bitcoin has so much room to grow upwards. If this is the argument, then I probably agree.  
  
2) Bitcoin bubbles are probably necessary as an ongoing phenomenon during the growth phase. But that doesn't mean they are helpful. Every single bubble is followed by a painful correction. The flurry of mining competition, infrastructure scrambles, early adopter diversification, and newcomer investment creates more chaos and potential for financial harm than it does benefit in the short term.  
  
That said, I can't dismiss Dan's claims outright. He seems to have his head screwed on pretty well. That combined with Bitcoin's endless ability to shock and awe everybody, including its biggest fans, means that having a strong opinion is challenging.  
  
I would say that I wouldn't be the saddest man in the world in the scenario he describes. Sure, it will not be without some level of sadness that I eat grapes and have my feet are massaged in the Citadel, thinking of the friends who got steamrolled by the crisis...
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:34:41
I've never considered that analogy before. But with respect to the fact that there are a limited number of coins to be "eaten" regardless of the number of hippos, then yes, it's like that.

Bitcoin is like a Zen koan. As soon as you can define it, it defies your definition.  
  
Since 2011 I have said things such as "Bitcoin will surprise us!" after which Bitcoin did nothing for over a year. Then, when Bitcoin started punching through the all-time-highs, I proclaimed "see how awesome Bitcoin is? Now we begin total assimilation."  
  
Right about then, Bitcoin decided to pull another slide along for a while... I don't live by the price, trust me. But somewhere in here is an analogy with prime numbers: unpredictable, yet somehow regular. Regardless, infuriating at times.

You clearly know what you are talking about, and I respect your view that there are multiple things to account for.  
  
But the same problems that you are describing are not solved by current auditing practices, or at least not to the fullest extent possible. Would you agree?  
  
You've inspired me to look beyond the scope of simply proving reserves. Admittedly, it's only one slice of the financial picture of a company. So what can we achieve with digital auditing? Perhaps much of the benefit isn't necessarily with transparency to stakeholders, but rather to cost cutting for the institution.  
  
Take first the balance sheet, which all companies maintain. This part is straightforward, and easily proven by digital signatures. But you mention the temporally dependent in and outflows such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other ongoing liabilities and expected revenue.  
  
I know, today, this type of task seems insurmountable, but from a technical standpoint, all of the things that auditors must look for and verify can be represented on the blockchain. Insurance? That's a quarterly obligation, registered on the blockchain. Loan service? That's a monthly obligation, registered on the blockchain.  
  
The point is, when the tools are in place, simply initiating a long-term liability is done so on the blockchain. I don't mean to be futuristic, but I fail.  
  
Consider starting from scratch, as a blockchain company, in which you voluntarily register all of your assets and liabilities on the blockchain. You speak of inventory. How to value it, depreciate it? It's all just formulae. Very little is subjective, and that which is shouldn't have an enormous effect on the overall health of the company.  
  
Tied into a network of distributed trust, a lot of the busywork and guesswork can be removed. Is it a silver bullet? No. But compared to modern practices, I expect that there is much room for new standards of accountability. Don't you?

@_date: 2014-09-10 16:52:14
You have two questions in your post:  
  
1) Why should higher adoption mean higher prices? The answer is higher demand for bitcoin.  
  
2) You ask why people think bitcoin is deflationary when in fact it is highly inflationary at the moment. This is true. Inflation is about 10% right now. So the "scarcity" effect won't be fully leveled until another block reward halving or two, and this is well-understood.

Sure, I see what you are saying. If by that point, let's say the margins are varied but within 10% for all players, then all players should turn off their rigs. The reality is, however, that if you are the best miner, and you know it, that you have an incentive to muddle through the difficulty adjustments. Even though in the short term you will lose money, it won't take long before the adjustments reaffirm your profitability. In addition, the top 50% of miners should have a good idea about whether or not they are in this group, and will keep their rigs going to expedite the difficulty adjustment, since it is in all of their favors. In further addition, many delusional miners will continue mining as well, hoping that they too are in this group, even though they aren't.

I was trying to show you why a $25 minimum wage is as terrible an idea as any minimum wage. What you failed to admit is that some workers cannot command such a wage. These are the younger, and less skilled workers. No employer will ever hire somebody for less money than they can earn for the business, and so in supporting a minimum wage, you wage direct war on the less fortunate, less skilled, and more needy.  
  
If you earn more than the minimum wage, a minimum wage doesn't affect you, and if it does, it is only so far as that you will have to justify your work against that of somebody who is willing to work for less. The minimum wage removes the bottom rung on the ladder, ensuring greater unemployment for those who need it most.  
  
OK, your turn. And I'll refrain from insulting you personally as you have me.

Probably buy some more. If Bitcoin goes to to $10,000 you'll have $100. If it goes to $100,000 you'll have $1,000.  
  
$100,000 per Bitcoin puts the total value of all bitcoins around a $trillion, so I don't think we'll be seeing that number anytime soon.

While it is certainly a threat, this issue has been discussed at length. What would probably happen in the event of some catastrophic drop in mining (i.e. 90%) would be an organized fork in the protocol to reset the difficulty immediately. Kind of a pain, but not really a big deal.

Depends on the currency of course. We've seen lots of examples of currencies experiencing increased demand (Swiss Franc) and decreased demand (Zimbabwean dollar). Bitcoin can experience the same.  
  
But even if your claim is true that the total "demand" for currency is some kind of global constant, it means that Bitcoin has incredible room to grow, as it only occupies a fraction of that "money base" at the moment.

You are welcome to start your own sandcastle, or even encourage others to join you, but to build the most valuable sandcastle, you're going to need to get more than 50% of the others to join you.  
  
To answer your question more specifically, you may in fact come up with a superior set of rules, after which the majority of the other will flock to your corner of the sandbox. This is akin to a Bitcoin developer making an update to the protocol which is obviously beneficial. After that point, your changes will be incorporated into the sand castle design, and it will grow higher than the others.

If you place a bid order below market price, and it gets filled, your buying didn't move the price down. Absent your bid, the seller would have had to accept an even lower bid, which would result in an even lower price. Your buy order buoyed the price in this case.

At least the author is being fairly neutral/objective. He makes two points, 1) that bitcoin is volatile, and 2) that a limited money supply is incompatible with a growing economy.   
  
The first point he ended up debunking on his own, that just because BTC is volatile today doesn't mean it will be so in the future. The second point is much more relevant, and it should be an incredible period of discovery to determine which school of thought is correct. If bitcoin can succeed as a limited supply currency, then the world will have to rewrite 75 years of incorrect economic theory.

Article I section 8 says that the US government has the authority to coin money and to punish those who attempt to counterfeit it. There is nothing in the constitution rendering alternative currencies illegal. Remember, the constitution enumerates what the government is permitted to do, and prohibited from doing, to and for individuals; not the other way around.  
  
The author also seems to forget that according to Article I section 10, the US dollar is unconstitutional in its current form, as it represents neither gold nor silver, the only materials permitted by the government to be used in the payment of debts.

Right. Selling on the market lowers the price. But buyers buy up. Yes, you can leave a bid below market price and hope that it gets filled eventually, but if you want to purchase now, the lowest price you get is market, and you work your way through the chain of asks as you accumulate.

If you've got 1,000 bitcoins, keeping 20 or so on your phone wouldn't be a big deal.  
  
Also, I've had bitcoin on my phone for almost three years. Every time the price jumps 10x I have to move more into cold storage. I can see how somebody who literally didn't touch his bitcoins for three years could end up with 20 on his phone. That was only $100 in late 2011.

You'll need larger block sizes for sure. But mining fees now can be around 0.5 BTC, and while ~$300 isn't much compared to the ~$18,000 block reward, it's still 1/60th. So if we can boost transaction volume enough, and allow enough transactions through larger blocks, then the mining fees should be roughly equivalent to the block reward today.

Yes, you can buy bitcoins without raising the price. But what price are you talking about? Typically, we refer to active exchange market places to determine the current price. Off market, you can certainly set up a deal which does not affect the market price, but only to a certain extent. There are only so many coins for sale off of the exchanges. 
  
If you were to buy your coins from an exchange, then you would be accepting ask orders at and above the current market price. Doing so raises the price.

Happy to elaborate. In this scenario, the issuer of the bonds is the "person", even though it may be comprised of many individuals - many of whom have no idea that the investment scheme has an expiration date. I would probably include the Federal Reserve and the Treasury in the US as the Mr. Ponzi in this case.  
  
Yes, you make a good point that it would be a stretch to consider the returns on US Treasuries as outsized. However, considering the magnificent size and time frames involved, I suspect that the amount of time that a Ponzi scheme can survive is directly related to its return rate. If you were to facilitate a scam of your own, you could probably keep the program going longer if you offered 4% than 40%.  
  
To conclude, in a world where it is absolutely impossible for owners of US bonds to be paid back their investment in full, anything over 0% might arguably be considered abnormal.

Assuming 1,000,000 users, top 0.1% would be the top 1,000 holders.  
  
My gut tells me that it takes about 1,500 coins to be in the top 1,000. The average amount for this group is probably something around 4,000.
1,500 x 4,000 = 6,000,000 which is about roughly half of extant bitoins.

Most people already are comfortable with spending money that deflates at 20% per year, and I'll give you an example.
  
It's counterintuitive but the analogy holds perfectly: If you buy something today with a credit card, and carry the balance forward instead of paying the full amount, then you essentially spent a deflationary currency.  
  
The comparison is that something which costs $100, which you pay off after a year, really costs you $120 at the time of sale. However, if you wait a year and take that money which you would have used to pay off your credit card bill to buy the item, it will cost you $100.  
  
With over $1 trillion in outstanding credit card debt in the US, I believe this illustrates that people still spend money today even though they can get a better deal if they wait until later.

Anybody who has held onto enough bitcoins to be in the top 1,000 holders has done so through multiple bubble bursts. Hanging on to an asset while its value is plummeting 20-80% is actually more difficult than most people think.  
  
Other than that, from reading your comments, I see a heavy liberal (new liberal, not old liberal) influence. This view tends to eschew inequality in wealth and to be suspicious of those who have accumulated it. That opinion isn't without merit, but as others have pointed out, most true grievances arise from the use of force, often by proxy of a governing body.  
  
The wealthy may be able to afford better lobbyists, but in the world of Bitcoin, they can only lobby general policy, and not monetary policy, which tends to be the most insidious and destructive.

Keep in mind that there is definitely going to be a turning point where mining profitability gets hits pretty hard - nobody disputes this. When the hash rate does level out, and begin to decline, it will seek new equilibria at a lower level. Somebody, somewhere, is always gong to be mining. The incentive structure ensures this. I think the real question worth asking is whether or not the hashing power will be sufficient to protect the network against malicious attacks - it's far from certain whether this will be the case.

Are you sure you applied the correct analysis to the first part? You are assessing discrete chunks of rolls. Shouldn't you perform the test on all of the individual rolls (essentially, are you mistakenly evaluating a dozen or so rolls with 2028?)? At any rate, 1000 bits EDIT: Nevermind. I think you had it right.  
  
EDIT2: Actually I'm not sure. Uhg, pulling out my old stats textbooks.  
  
EDIT3: OK, I think that you can only do that test on one value at a time, since they are not independent events. The problem is that you are chi-squaring the probability of the deviation of all of the values being that far from their expected value. So you are compounding the p value by applying the AND logic on non-independent events, when you are actually evaluating a single die. i.e. Every 6 that rolls, can't also be an f. Does that make sense?  
  
EDIT4: For example, if you flipped a coin 100 times and got 42/58. You can't meaningfully calculate the probability that heads would be 42 AND tails would be 58, unless they were two different coins.

That doesn't seem like a very smart idea. If you had, say 10,000 BTC, and you sold it on the open market, you would wipe out much of the order book and get a terrible deal, let's imagine 50% slip, so the average price they get is $300 per coin.  
  
Now, they need to turn around and buy coins from the USG in an auction in which they have no idea who else is bidding. Other bidders may be putting in orders at $300, $500, even $700 depending on how desperate they are to acquire a large amount.  
  
If the "whale" fails to win any coins in the auction, he then has to buy back into a thin order book, which will cause even more slip. All in all, failing to get the coins from the USG for cheaper could cut his stash in half.

While the jumps are a bit jarring, the steadily decreasing inflation rate helps to smooth some of the transition. For instance, after the first block reward halving, the total number of bitcoins was 10.5 million. A 25 BTC block reward adds about 1.3 million BTC per year, which was initially a 12.5% annual inflation rate. By the last day of the 25 BTC block rewards, the total number of bitcoins will be 15.75 million, meaning that the inflation rate will be 8.25, a 33% decrease, which occurred smoothly.

The US dollar has to decline against something else. Usually it is a basket of other currencies, or something called the CPI, which is a basket of goods and services that are used to measure the purchasing power of a dollar.  
  
If the dollar declines relative to everything else, and Bitcoin does not, then the price of Bitcoin will go up in terms of dollars.  
  
Keep in mind that the price of Bitcoin can go up in dollars while the dollar is simultaneously strengthening against the CPI. Think of everything - currencies, wagons, potatoes...etc - as all floating in relation to one another.

Short term, yes the price will go up when people hoard. But as you correctly are pointing out, it doesn't last forever. So people hoard until they don't. A higher price turns some of those hoarders into sellers or spenders. However, it doesn't follow that hoarding bitcoins will make them worthless. How does one get to zero from ~$500 through hoarding?  
  
Spending with replacement should have zero impact on price, I agree. But you are equating this with "doing nothing," which includes both continuing to hoard, and continuing to not buy.  
  
If somebody is not a hoarder, then they most certainly are a seller. I agree with your equivalence between "not selling" and spending + replacing on the price. But spending/replacing is only a better alternative to just sitting on your coins because it spreads the word, so to speak. I suppose this boils it down to a marketing point.  
  
If everybody stopped selling immediately and hoarded their coins, the price would go through the roof, which arguably has a much greater impact (to the marketing point in my last paragraph) on encouraging merchants and individuals to accept Bitcoin - wouldn't you agree?

Maybe. Proof of solvency is certainly a more complicated equation than proof of reserves, I admit. However, clearly Mt. Gox would have failed the latter, which would have potentially saved its customers a lot of pain.  
  
Used as a deceptive tool, I agree that it really doesn't get us any closer to trusting the financial health of a company. But I do believe that it's the first step in a more comprehensive set of practices which could bring us nearer to that goal.

Proof of stake provides a nice network maintenance function, which is assuredly less expensive than proof of work. However, and I'll let others chime in here, I believe it suffers weakness in the way of establishing decentralized consensus under certain conditions which POS does not.
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:04:06


  
I think this must be where you are misunderstanding. When a Bitcoin grows or shrinks in value, the price is the only thing that changes. You don't suddenly have more or less Bitcoins in your wallet. The apple doesn't get any bigger or smaller, it just costs more at the supermarket. You are correct that it is not a physical thing, but that's because math is an abstraction. However, it is still very real, even though you can't necessarily touch it.  
  


  
You might be right that it had not achieved critical mass yet. Only time will tell. However, the Network Effect should ensure that no matter how many alt-coins there are, that only a handful will have any significant success.  
  


  
Again, I think you are confusing scarcity with divisibility. I don't mean any disrespect when I say that many, many people get this wrong, including people who should know better. Gold is a good counter example. I hope you'll agree that historically, the rise of gold being used as a currency and medium of exchange benefited from the network effect, even though gold is still scarce. Scarcity doesn't mean that there isn't enough to go around, only that it is rare. I agree that it's a fine distinction, but it's an important one.  
  


  
To my previous point, yes, this is possible, and it would be precisely because of the network effect that it would succeed. Take Dogecoin, for instance. They went from zero users to almost as many users as Bitcoin in a couple of months, thanks to a powerful and playful viral ethos.  
  


  
Ah, my mistake. Well you wouldn't really. Art is discrete, whereas Bitcoin is divisible.

Just make sure you run the numbers in terms of payoff per ghash. It is hard enough to make a profit with your own mining rigs, and even more so with cloud hashing because of the overhead they must charge for. If you want to speculate, by all means go right ahead, but know that mining is a losing game in the long run.

Yes, that is correct. If you were to request a buy of 1 BTC at $10,000, then your order would automatically be filled at the lowest prices offered. So you might get 0.2 BTC at $420, 0.4 BTC at $421, and 0.6 BTC at $422, for example.

@_date: 2014-04-05 09:56:02
I believe it is the opposite, although admittedly counter intuitive. As the block reward goes down, miners will favor including more transactions in their blocks. A larger pool of accepted transactions means a lower fee threshold to be included in the block. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:41:13
It makes perfect sense. If I trade you 1 share of Apple for a pizza when the price was $20 a piece, and you still have that share, the only price that is relevant is what it is worth today = ~$600.  
  
Remember, that wallets can receive many "deposits" over time. At each point in time, the value was different for each transaction. How would you propose we display the value of a wallet with 10,000 BTC which has been amassed over 5 years in small increments?
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:58:27
If that is true, then I don't mind being in opposition to most mainstream economists. Very few of them saw the mortgage crisis coming in 2008, and even less of them think we'll experience a sovereign debt crisis in the US within the next couple of years (bookmark this comment so we can see who is right!)  
  
No, I've never tried to live on $7 per hour, but I've earned it in the past (less, $6.21 actually). Minimum wage jobs are entry level jobs, meant for people who are just getting started and building their skills. There is nothing wrong with having a minimum wage job, but nobody should be earning minimum wage in the US for 20 years straight.   
  
Nobody has the right to expect a minimum wage job to support a family, and if you earn minimum wage, then you should think twice before having kids, as you won't be able to provide for them, at least not yet. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but the solution to this socio-economic crisis isn't to make shitty entry level jobs slightly less shitty.   
  
But should a single person be able to survive on minimum wage? Sure. Housing too expensive? Get a roommate. Food prices too high? Don't eat out. Gas prices too high? Get a shitty bike and ride everywhere. There are so many things that people waste money on just because they don't make an effort to cut back. Even after I got my first salaried job, I still lived like a poor student for the first year just out of habit, and probably spent less than I would have earned at minimum wage.
Have you ever tried to live on $7 an hour? If so, I would be interested in hearing your perspective.
@_date: 2014-09-09 01:35:58


  
Yes, but that is why they are so hard to find. You have no idea what the output will be, so you have to brute force until you get a low enough number.  
  
As far as checking the work of other miners, they employ the cryptographic principle of being able to prove you have done something, without actually showing how you did it. A bit spooky, but totally legit.
@_date: 2014-10-13 20:00:28
They might be. The problem is that lower transaction fees in general disincentivize miners, meaning that a low-cost environment would result in a less secure network.  
  
The end game isn't clear. But the good news is that the incentive structure means that the cost of transactions is affected by market demand. If the cost is too high, then people make less transactions, and squeeze miners out of the game. If the cost is too low, then people make more transactions, bringing miners back into the game.  
 
Wherever we end up, it will be a voluntary system, so presumably both parties get what they want.
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:33:23

That is unfortunate. PayPal is a great place for scammers to pretend to sell you all sorts of things. This kind of thing really upsets me.  
  
If you bought with a credit card, you need to immediately call them and reverse the charge (provided the seller has stopped talking to you). If the money was already on PayPal, then you're in a tough spot. It doesn't hurt to contact PayPal and complain, but they have been singularly deaf eared with respect to digital currency sales.

Bitcoin is probably dead again. 1000 bits @_date: 2014-06-12 18:43:35
The impact will be felt much sooner, within the next 20 years or so, since the block reward will quickly fall to a level in which transaction fees become more and more important to the miners.  
  
But to answer your question. Mining is going to get crushed, most likely. It all depends on the future volume of transactions and their associated transaction fees, which are unknown.

If you want to purchase a large ticket item, you'll need an escrow agent.

@_date: 2014-12-17 18:50:41
I agree to an extent, but the reason that it's difficult for citizens to jettison their government currency due to a sudden disbelief in its value is perhaps more importantly that they owe money denominated in that currency.  
  
Sure, you can say FU to the dollar, but that still doesn't make your mortgage, student loans, car payments, and credit card bills disappear. People more often chase dollars because they need them in the current system, not just because they believe they have value.  
  
But yeah, currency crises do happen, and it's often from a loss of confidence in the value of the currency, but usually for good reason: not just that it's paper, but that it is being inflated to ease the burden of government debts.

For instance, is there a way you can at least demonstrate in practice how you do not save a copy of the private key? Perhaps a video for each assembly at the point where you generate (oh, that's another question. how are you ensuring proper key generation and entropy?) the private key and can somehow demonstrate that it is the only copy... We'd still have to trust you, but it would be a step in the right direction...

Trading bots exist, of course. Just as they do on large international exchanges such as the NASDAQ. In fact, I believe that the vast majority of trades on large exchanges are completed by trading algorithms.  
  
However, there are limits to what bots can do. A programmer of a bot can try to game the market upwards using a number of techniques, but each of which carries risk. Trading costs money, and the more you do it, the easier it is to lose in the long term.  
  
So yes, there are bots and people trying to game the market, but it isn't easy to do, and it isn't risk free.

Correct, sort of. The fees are optional, but if you want a fast confirmation, you need to include them. Today it's about 5 cents for a transaction to get through (as the price of BTC goes up, this fee gets adjusted downwards from time to time). But you can send less, or nothing, and eventually it will go through. Large transactions and old transactions are prioritized. Fees incentivize the miners to include your transaction in a block.

I can understand why you are upset, but I'm still not sure what happened. The links on the wiki do not go to phishing sites as far as I can tell. Can you give us some more detail about what happened? Are there any transactions you can point us to? Is there a chance that you haven't really been scammed but perhaps the account is waiting for 6 confirmations before displaying a balance? More info, please.

Hi friend,  
  
Looks like you should spend some time reading the side bar and getting up to speed with all the details of Bitcoin (little 'C'). It's really too big a topic to cover in a short period of time.  
  
That said, there are lots of reasons that people would be for or against Bitcoin. Some of them are ideological (i.e. if you are a Keynsian, you believe that money supplies should be elastic as opposed to stable), and some of them are based on misunderstanding (i.e. claims that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme).  
  
With respect to your last comment, Bitcoin is as physical as you want it to be. And you can make as many copies as you want and store it almost anywhere, including your brain.  
  
Yes, your brain. Now get reading!

I admit that economists are divided on the issue, but much more evenly than, say, scientists are on climate change.  
  
[Here is an article that you may find sufficiently economic]( along with the [signatures of 500 economists including 4 Nobel laureates.]( Granted, it's an endorsement rather than a study, but if you want I'm sure I can dig up some good studies on the negative impact of minimum wage laws. 
  
I suspect that we have a lot in common, particularly with our objectives. I hate poverty; I'm sure you do too. I am sympathetic to the poor, which I am sure you are as well. Where I think we'll fail to agree is what is to be done about it. At best, I see moderate increases in minimum wage as pretty lame. Is an extra $2 or $3 per hour really going to change the life of a minimum wage earner? Even if it does, for how long? Inflation is the true enemy of all wage earners, since wages are "sticky" (I'll credit Keynes with that one, and he was right), whilst commodity prices are not. Increasing the minimum wage ignores the underlying structural problems in the economy, in favor of a politically salient band-aid.  
  
Would I wish sweatshop work on anybody? Of course not. But that also doesn't mean I would take away somebody's only livelihood, as meager and unfair is it may be.

Mining isn't really related to price, except for the amount that miners must sell on the open market to pay their bills.  
  
The price of bitcoin is a function of its scarcity and usefulness. But remember that right now inflation is at about 10%, which is pretty high. Once we get down into 5%, 2.5%, 1%, etc. is where you'll see a more stable long term price emerge.

Hi waingroo. I think you pose a very good question. From browsing the comments in this thread, it is clear to me that there is a lot of talking past one another.  
  
I'll begin with a few statements that I believe are true, but you are free to disagree with. Perhaps the main issue that you have is with one of these premises, rather than with Bitcoin, but I don't know yet.  
 
1) People accumulate assets as a natural part of economic activity, whether fiat currency, stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, food, or Bitcoin.  
  
2) Everybody makes choices about which allocations that they feel most comfortable with. Some people like cash, others dividend paying blue chips, etc.  
  
3) People prefer to not allocate capital into assets that they expect to depreciate.
4) People are naturally inclined to favor the assets that they have chosen to stake their future on. This is shown in their enthusiasm and arguments in favor of their portfolio.
  
5) Bitcoin is not a scam. It is a piece of software that permits the storing and transfer of a scarce digital token. These have market value and can be held, sold, spent, lost, stolen, or invested.  
  
6) Bitcoin is genuinely new, and permits activity that has not been possible in the past. For example, I can send $1M worth of Bitcoin to my friend in Kenya on a Sunday night when banks are closed, instantly, and securely, for free. To some people, this is very exciting.
  
To answer your question directly, I don't believe that you are addressing something unique to Bitcoin. You can replace the word Bitcoin with any assets that people are holding and believe will appreciate in value, and your request is still valid.  
  
The answer is, that it depends on each and every individual. Some people wish only to trade Bitcoin for fiat at some point in the future. Some people have a plan to diversify into other assets as the price of Bitcoin rises. Some people are ideologically motivated, and will never divest their Bitcoin holdings.    
  
To me, none of this is particularly upsetting. So I would like to pose the question to you: Why do Bitcoin holders upset you?
  
Thanks again for the interesting debate. $2 @_date: 2014-10-20 17:18:04

Keep in mind that $85T in annual economic activity does not = $85T of currency. You have to divide by the velocity of money (usually between 5-40).  
  
1% of $85T is $850B. Divide by, say, 10 for velocity, and you get $85B, or ~$6,400 per coin.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:14:29
If you are operating an exchange, and are actually allowing people to trade on it, then what you are seeing is fair market value. The reason is that I can make an order for x-amount BTC and actually watch it clear in real time. That means that the offers on the table are real, whether they are provided by the exchange or a third party. The exchange can certainly participate in the market, but it can't artificially move the price without people noticing.

Yeah, I'm with you on this one. If you take the opposite approach and ask somebody what they would want if they could design their own, brand new, perfect store of wealth, I wouldn't be surprised if "scarcity," "ease of storage," "and ease of transfer" come out near the top. Add a sprinkling of "nobody can take it from you without your permission," and you've got yourself a stew going!  
  
I should add that "stability in price" doesn't really qualify as this is an emergent result of the store of wealth's qualities. The challenge would be to the designer: OK, how do you make this thing so that it is, or will be, stable or rising in value over a long period of time?

It's true. Miners are going to get squeezed pretty hard eventually. Without a block size increase, the transaction fees would have to be substantial to maintain any semblance of network security.  
  
What makes me optimistic is that the value inherent in the system will incentivize the market to find clever ways to avoid a 51% attack. For instance, you could throw a bunch of hard-coded satellites in orbit that always get a 25% vote on the consensus. It creates a point of failure, but I'd really love to see somebody try and take out a few dozen satellites just to take down the financial system...

It's not easy. All commits roughly follow the Linux model of testing and review. There aren't that many core devs, but it would still be very difficult to get something egregious past them.

@_date: 2014-04-05 21:24:13
This wouldn't be possible with current technology/theoretical math. While it may seem that bitcoins can't be copied and pasted, it's not entirely accurate. You can share a public address with as many people as you like.  
  
What is unique about Bitcoin is that there is only one person who can control the *movement* of the coins. So there is a dynamic function at play.  
  
To carry the analogy forward, with respect to an image or sound clip, people will always be able to copy and share them. After all, just looking at or listening to such a file makes a lo-fi copy in your brain, negating the "singularity" you are looking for.  
  
You COULD however, create a way to allow people to "own" that particular file, in that they would be the only ones who could transfer ownership to another person. It wouldn't make the file scarce, but it would create a secure tag that says "This is gothram's file. If you want your name on the tag, pay him $1Million."  
  
Hope that helps.

The synchronization wouldn't be a problem as interplanetary payments could be settled once per day or so.  
  
The issue would be the mining synchronization, as transactions wouldn't propagate properly.  
  
You could probably fork the code, and allow for independent mining on Mars. Or this could be done by creating an asset via a 2.0 product like Counterparty or Mastercoin.  
  
Totally feasible. After all, how often are you going to be sending funds between Earth and Mars?

Well, right now, it's about 2,500 bits per 1 USD. So just do the simple multiplication.

$10 = 25,000 bits  
$100 = 250,000  
  
etc.

I would also blame the average person's inability to understand why fiat currency is so bad. That, coupled with the relatively challenging user interfaces and security risks, is probably to blame for most people's reticence towards Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-15 15:09:09
Yeah, no worries. In essence, anything can be leveraged. It just means borrowing to multiply your returns. And usually fiat money is the thing being borrowed, and stocks, bonds, or other financial assets are the things being bought with turbo-charged money.  
  
Certainly, you could borrow Bitcoin for this purpose, but I agree that if it shows a reasonable return over time, that people will be lesson incentivized to do so. Rather, they will more likely borrow *other* fiat currencies to accumulate more Bitcoin. This of course comes with its own set of implications.
But yeah, you can borrow anything, but in a Bitcoin world we probably wouldn't borrow as much, you're right.

If a block is valid, then it will propagate through the nodes very quickly. Mining nodes which have accepted the block then move on to looking for the next block in the block chain, and everything goes smoothly.  
  
Sometimes, blocks are found at about the same time in two different parts of the world. At that point it's something of a race to see which miner's block propagates the fastest. Once more than 50% of nodes have accepted a block, then their version of the blockchain will gradually pull away from the minority and what will become the orphaned block.   
  
Sometimes, a minority branch can in fact persevere over the majority branch. Say, for instance, that you and I find blocks at the same time, and now 60% of the network is working atop my block and 40% on yours. It is possible that your 40% find another block before my 60%, in which case, your superior block height will pull my miners into your court, since they are always trying to mine atop the longest chain.

Basically, but not actually.
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:11:34
The cost varies depending on hardware and the local cost of electricity.  
  
The issuance of new Bitcoins remains relatively constant (25 about every 10 minutes). The difficulty to mine these coins goes up or down depending on the amount of computing power that people apply towards mining.  
  
If the price goes down, some miners will shut off their unprofitable rigs, and the difficulty would adjust downwards, in the scenario you describe.

@_date: 2014-11-12 20:46:59
After reading it twice, I'm not entirely sure I understand it very well. A few issues that I might bring up include.  
  
1) PoW is currently the only known method to achieve decentralized consensus. Yes, it is wasteful, but the author seems to think that we can cut this cost with some type of community reward system. Again, I don't really understand how he intends to maintain the rock-solid trust that PoW has created for Bitcoin.  
  
2) He might be confusing the idea of little or no cost to do something with that of an incentive. Sure, mining the new rewards might be essentially cost and risk free to miners from a financial standpoint, but I would be very surprised if they didn't consider the irreparable damage that would be caused by porting Bitcoin over to another platform. Again, I don't fully understand the incentive structure that the author has laid out, so I'm having trouble putting a fine point on it.
@_date: 2014-06-12 19:02:43

I think it really depends on the relationship (pardon the pun). If it is a bank:customer situation, then financial transparency might be called for. Even it if isn't required, it could certainly be a differentiating factor between competing banks. Bitcoin allows individuals and businesses to engage in as much transparency as they care to, which is pretty unique.  
  
In your analogy, checking your girlfriend's phone amounts to spying, which is something completely different. We are talking about voluntary transparency in a business relationship.  
  
That said, look for further posts on personal privacy, of which the author is a staunch advocate.

Well, I suppose that does meet my criteria. But you kind of cheated by just giving it away. And 1 satoshi can hardly be considered adopting. That's like giving somebody a piece of sand and calling them a homeowner.
  
However! There are lots of these initiatives going on, such as the bit drop thing in Dominica and the MIT student bitcoin giveaway. Adoption through charity probably won't affect the price. But it might spark a community into using, and liking, the currency, which they may later decide to get more of.  
  
This kind of goes back to my first point about shoving it in people's pockets. That's not really the kind of adoption people are talking about. People are talking about other individuals seeing the benefits of bitcoin, and wanted to get their hands on it for those reasons.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:20:08
To respond, I need to refrain from being exasperated about your first comment, since this is a mistake that many, many, many people make, and once I can get you to understand this point, please let me know about your thought process so that in the future, I can explain it more succinctly. The point is that quantity and divisibility are TWO COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT THINGS. This is simple math. If I have 1 apple, I can carve it up into a thousand pieces. I can carve it up into 10,000 pieces. With a blender, I could carve it into millions of pieces. I still have one apple, no matter how many times I slice it. Splitting the apple does not make it any more or less valuable and it can't feed any more people than it already does. So no, you are incorrect. Bitcoin IS scarce, but there is sufficient divisibility to allow for it to be used even if the value goes up significantly. Does this make sense?  
  
Second, you are correct that Bitcoin is not unique. But then again, neither is the Facebook code. I could copy and paste the Facebook website with all its functionality, and maybe even make it a little better. But will people use it? Probably not. This is due to something called the Network Effect, which favors first movers exponentially above those that follow. It even works for goods and services that people don't like. Mt. Gox for example was screwing with customers for over a year before they went belly up, pissing off everybody. But still, people stuck around.  
  
Third, you would send a piece of valuable art around the world if you wished to either a) exchange it for another good or service, or b) expatriate your wealth. I wasn't really going in that direction with my analogy: Bitcoin is useful in different ways than rare paintings, but I'm happy to still give that example.

Correct. If you are using Bitcoin QT you'll have to wait for it to download and verify the whole blockchain. If you really need access to your coins in the meantime, there are ways of exporting your private keys to another "lite" wallet. If you can wait, just wait. Your coins are waiting for you.

1) Conflates current user base demographics with institutionalized sexism and racism.  
  
2) Misunderstands mining as relevant to Bitcoin's usefulness as a currency and payment system.  
 
3) Makes confusing point about how Bitcoin miners are somehow more powerful than simple holders, ignoring the fact that about 95% of miners today are in the red on their initial investment.  
  
4) Title should be "Bitcoin - good for *whom*"

I'm just curious about how you feel about prices in general. For instance, in the US, many housing markets have seen an increase of 25% over the past year. That's hardly price stability. Or take electronics, for example, which consistently get cheaper every year in terms of storage, speed, and functionality.  
  
The reality is that there is no such thing as price stability. In Florida this year, limes went from about $3 for 20 to $3 for 5, and then back to 10. And yet, we don't see this as some type of deficiency in the dollar.  
  
What do you mean, respectfully, when you say you desire price stability?

These points are mostly true, and gold is certainly less risky than bitcoin. But gold isn't legal tender either...also, the point about trust is somewhat redundant.

It sets a target number, below which a block can be valid. Since a SHA256 hash is just a really long number, it can be fine tuned to achieve the 10 minute goal. After the 0000's follows other numbers which are greater than zero, but still important. Hope that helps.

If the costs are too high, then people won't use it. As far as I can tell, people don't seem to mind.  
  
Also, if your argument is that Bitcoin inflation equates to transaction costs, then you're wrong. It applies to holding Bitcoin too. It's the cost of the total system. Similarly, we don't look at USD inflation rates, and divide it by the number of dollar transactions in the economy to come up with a per-transaction cost.

At least somebody could make the argument (spurious in my opinion), that US Treasuries are investments in the US economy, and the ability of the government to tax its citizens. SS on the other hand, while billed as an insurance program in its infancy, is blatantly a Ponzi scheme.

When gold was monetized, it was incredibly stable. Higher liquidity will bring less volatility, which will encourage more people to denominate prices and contracts in Bitcoin, which will further help to anchor the value over time.

The connection is that now a miner is incentivized to include 0 transactions in their blocks to propagate their solution to the network faster precisely because the block reward is so large. In the future, as the block reward decreases both in real terms and in percentage of total haul, miners will be incentivized to include as many transactions as they can, to increase their reward. To put it another way, the choice today is either to take 25BTC with a good chance of beating out other block-finders, 25.1BTC with a small chance that your block will be orphaned, or 25.2BTC with a slightly larger chance that your block will be orphaned. In the future, the difference between .1 and .2 will be more significant, pushing miners to increase their blocks to the max size possible to acquire as many fees as possible. Under this scenario, even small transaction fees will be accepted.
  
You are correct that the block size is currently capped at 1MB. However, this number is expected to be revised upwards in the near future.  
  
That said, we will have to wait and see how it plays out in the real world. Thus far, the exchange rate of BTC has been the  factor driving the "standard" transaction fee. It's certainly an interesting topic to discuss!

Building the history of transactions (the blockchain) is a collaborative process. Miners around the world are competing to find the next block, and once they find one, everybody else starts building upon theirs.  
  
Ghash "processes" a lot of the blocks, but that doesn't mean they have any real control. If they were to gain more than 50% of the network AND start funny business such as rejecting or reversing transactions, you would hear about it.  
  
Anger doesn't really solve anything long term, but it does show that the community is committed to keeping mining as decentralized as possible. The more that Ghash resists limiting their network strength, the more likely that people will boycott them.  
  
Keep in mind that a mining pool operator still has to pay attention to his constituents. Ghash is made up of thousands of individual miners who pool their resources so that they get more frequent payouts. At the moment, there is nothing besides community sentiment and miner rational self-interest to keep an entity from getting above 50%.

To be fair, most wealthy people do not keep much of their net worth in currencies. Typically, their portfolios are stocks, bonds, and real estate. So even if 50 people controlled 25% of the Bitcoins, that wouldn't necessarily entitle them to top-wealth status.  
  
Also, if Bitcoin ever reaches such a status, most of those 50 individuals would have sold off a large portion of their holdings. Top Bitcoin holders have been peeled off the top on a regular basis for the past 5 years.
@_date: 2014-06-20 18:58:22
It depends on your time-frame. Under the gold standard, the US experienced very high stability of prices over the long term, with short term fluctuations in purchasing power. You could rightfully argue that today we have more day-to-day price stability, but over the long term, the trend is towards an erosion of purchasing power.  
  
Pick your poison, I suppose. If you observe purchasing power swings as the market providing valuable signals to consumers and investors, then a hard money standard is very desirable. But I know that Keynesians put less faith in markets to provide such signals.

It doesn't. The two are relatively independent of one another. That doesn't mean that there isn't some relationship between the two - there certainly is. But whether the dollar strengthens or weakens in general against "other things" doesn't say anything about what Bitcoin is doing. If demand for Bitcoin goes through the roof because Greece defaults and all of its citizens rush to accumulate crypto currency, then the price will go up relative to "other things." 
EDIT: I think what you mean to ask is "If the price of Bitcoins in dollars remains stable, but the dollar is declining in purchasing power relative to goods, services, and other currencies, does that mean Bitcoin is going down in purchasing power as well?" to which the answer is "yes."

Great article. And you didn't even have to get into reduction in revenue per hash (Mhash, Ghash, Phash, whatever) as a result of the difficulty increases.  
  
Basically, miners make terrible anythings but miners. Sure, a couple years ago, you could use a rack of 50 BFL singles in lieu of your heater, but only because the bitcoin you mined more than made up for the electricity cost, which would be *in the thousands of dollars* per month. Once the mining reward is insignificant, we quickly realize that miners make for terrible heaters.

If everybody were to act in a game-theory ideal way, miners will mine at very low profitability up until the halving, at which point there will be a transition. During this transition, miners will probably continue to mine for a time to see if they can withstand the reward halving. Then, slowly, the most unprofitable miners will drop off, one by one. There will probably be some swings as miners equivocate, but in the end, the 50% with the most efficient set ups will remain.  
  
In the interim, the hash rate will affect the block discovery time, which may see swings into the 25 minute period. But we will certainly have enough hashing power to get to the next difficulty adjustment, which is limited somewhat, but not enough to cause concern.  
  
TL;DR, The network will hum along, with some minor disruptions in block discovery time. The less efficient miners will shut off their rigs.

It's true that it's a big idea, and it's true that it's not new. This reminds me of Picketty's book "Capital in the 21st Century," hailed as groundbreaking and full of new thought, but really just repackaging Marx.  
  
The speaker was very convincing, but he did not address some of the concerns that I would have raised. One, in particular, is stability. Over the long term, I can imagine all sorts of perverse incentives corrupting the system in general. There would be a heavy focus on adjusting the figure to meet living standards, but most likely it would end up dissolving just like Social Security retirement benefits in the US. Sure, people still get their checks, but they can barely cover the rent. In 20 years, SS checks will be a complete joke.

I actually agree with him. In the context of feedback loops, there are few things besides a high price which garner interest, and few things which raise the price besides saving (hoarding). Let the new adopters crash through your door, rather than trying to shove BTC in their pockets. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 14:31:51
Sure, "tied up" is just a figure of speech. But it's a good analogy considering that we calculate net worth in dollars, even when 90% of our assets could be stocks, bonds, and real estate. Because we measure in dollars, they feel "tied up" in our assets.  
  
However, I'm not sure what your point is about money. Nobody thinks that money itself gets tied up, or disappears when it is exchanged for something else. But, often money *is* created or destroyed, through the credit process. And that is a much more interesting conversation.  
  
By calling it "free money," I think what people are trying to say is "underpriced money." Meaning that the cost of money, the interest rate, is abnormally low, resulting in lots of borrowing.

Can't remember exactly who said it, but some free-market economist made a good argument for why multiple competing currencies is actually net-bad because of all the unnecessary friction that they cause; that a single currency is best *provided* that it's a good/honest one.  
  
To comment on the crux of the author's point, however, I have to point out that the hoarding argument is a total fallacy. Somehow it's proponents start off well, identifying a link between the price trend of the money, and the amount that people are saving it. Fine, so far so good. People hoard it, and it becomes more valuable. But they somehow then conclude that this results in the currency being worthless - it doesn't follow that something would become so valuable as to become worthless.  
  
The reality is that the price of the money will go up... until it doesn't. Once it becomes too expensive, new demand dries up, just like with anything. At that point, the price reverses, and people who previously hoarded it will start to unload their stash to preserve some of their wealth. Thought of in this way, it becomes really obvious that sound money creates a feedback system, where its price and desirability ebb and flow in a natural, and ultimately beneficial economic tide.

I agree with you, and am also an avid brainwallet user (all of mine are memorized), despite the general consensus around here that they are a bad idea. But I studied number theory in college, so I feel comfortable understanding the level of entropy that I achieve. But yes, caveat - WARNING: Do not use brainwallets unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing.  
  
For me, the brainwallets are actually a fail safe in case every single copy of my private keys is somehow destroyed or lost (it's unlikely, but I do think loss is more of a risk than theft at this point). I still keep multiple encrypted copies with a strong password. This addresses the issue that u/Dude-Lebowski brought up below.

Like the other people said, definitely spend some time learning about the whole thing. It's going to take at least a week to get your head wrapped around it.  
  
To answer your direct questions, you can choose where to store your coins, whether in your own personal wallet, or online with an exchange. Both have risks. Storing them yourself, you are more likely to lose them accidentally, and letting a third party store them makes them more vulnerable to theft.
  
Bitcoins go up and down in value as people trade them on exchanges. You can check the price easily on one of the many sites that track it.  
  
To convert them, just sell them to somebody else, either in person or on an online exchange.  
  
Also, Bitcoin *is* actual money. Welcome to the party :-)

If you are accusing me of getting too carried away with "the blockchain," then I'm guilty as charged.  
  
It is clear that I haven't given you sufficient practical examples of how the blockchain can be used to verify ownership through time. I am not, for example, advocating that companies use Bitcoin for transactions for their day to day operations or accounting practices. Rather, this would be a 2.0 application via counterparty/mastercoin/coloredcoins or whatever their descendants might be. In essence, there would be hashed pointers to the blockchain with certain property claims. 
  
This wouldn't be a straightforward application of "crypto logging." (Can I coin that term? I kind of like it.) Rather, it would bring efficiency to compartmentalized areas of a business's balance sheet. The first I mentioned, proof of reserves, it a great example of how easy it is to apply specifically if it is called for. As a standard, it would have to grow incrementally, for sure.  
  
Nobody cares about the local tool shop or bakery in this regard. The more I think about it, this is pretty much a financial institution specific framework. Physical assets for these are less of an issue than, say, for a microchip company. Banks rarely have any physical assets beyond their real estate, which is an easily accountable category.  
  
To solve the problems that you describe in the last sentence, you are correct that this implementation would need to not only provide a tangible benefit to somebody, but also reduce regulatory and accounting woes. I think it can do both. Why do we have audits in the first place? If the information under question were available automatically, then wouldn't this both increase transparency and reduce administrative burden?  
  
Please do continue, however. You are giving me much to think about.

@_date: 2014-02-28 14:30:49
a) The coins can be spent (successfully) after one confirmation.  
  
b) If blockchain.info has a "sweep wallet" function (I believe they do), then yes, use this. Otherwise, import the private key from your paper wallet into blockchain.info to add it it to your address book.  
  
After that, you can send coins to another address. Don't use the paper wallet again (but keep a copy somewhere in case you accidentally send coins there in the future. This kind of thing happens all the time).  
  
Hope that helps.

First, just a detail: "Their value was always in Fantasyland and subject to decline every time the compute power to "mine" the Bitcoins got cheaper, which it does every day."  
  
Cheaper computing power doesn't create coins significantly faster, which would depress the price. In fact, it probably has the opposite effect as miners become more profitable in the short term, and don't need to sell off as many of their coins to pay the electricity bill.  
  
Other than that, I'm not sure what "deafening silence" that the author is referring to. I've seen at least a couple dozen "Whelp, looks like Bitcoin is dead and the worst performing currency of 2015 and a Ponzi scheme after all, etc."

After a quick browse through the comments, I didn't see any comments addressing the author's central point of usury.  
  
Charging interest for money is fine. It is a voluntary transaction between someday who has saved, and somebody who has convinced that person that can they pay it back, presumably by putting it to good use. Without some type of compensation, this transaction would never occur. 
  
The situation is more complicated when the money itself is created as debt: loaning money that doesn't exist previously. This is the central problem with "usury," and why it has been earmarked in the history books as problematic.

The same goes for... well, anything. You can't pour money into anything, if you accept that all purchases are really just an exchange.  
  
But you got one thing wrong. Buying bitcoin raises the price, which makes all other bitcoins a little more valuable. So the effect is the same as "pouring" money in. Although "pouring through" might be a better analogy.  
  
With $100K, Bitcoin actually would become more than $100K stronger. A market purchase of that amount would raise the price about $2 per coin. With about 15M coins around, that means the total value of all bitcoins is now $30 million greater.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:34:25
The difficulty adjusts to keep the blocks coming out at 10 minutes. At the end of every two weeks or so, the block time will be less than or greater than 10 minutes (say 9:30 or 10:50). The difficulty adjustment instantaneously matches the current difficulty to a 10 minute block average.  Hope that helps.

Are you sure you aren't confusing making a market buy at $200, and then having the price leave you behind and go to $210? Market orders often don't fill, but there is pretty much no way that the price can go from $205 to $195 without filling the people who are bidding $200

You sell your coins to the highest bidder, which by definition always puts you at the front of the seller queue.  
  
Yes, if somebody is asking for less money than you are, you won't be making a trade. But there are two queues, buyers and sellers. You can't just jump below the highest bidder and sell coins for $10 less than they are asking - you wouldn't want to anyway.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:59:18
It would be a few lines of code. Could be done in a few minutes.  
  
The hard part would be convincing everybody else that your implementation was the right one. There would be disagreement as to whether they should just reset the difficulty lower, or add new algorithms to avoid the same problem in the future. Eventually it would get worked out.

Yeah fair enough. It's really not that bad. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:38:13
Correct. The difficulty would be much much lower.  
  
If the mining hash rate decreases at a sufficiently gradual rate, the adjustments downward will continue to happen within a reasonable period of time. If 99% of miners turned off their machines simultaneously, then the remaining miners would have to "reset" the difficulty manually, by hard forking the code.  
  
Of course, if you were the only miner left in the world, doing this would be pretty easy :-)  
  
EDIT: Just to be clear: mining has nothing to do with transaction processing. Mining uses transaction data to prove to other miners that a block is valid, but transaction processing is not a very labor intensive activity.

You can only fake trades on an exchange between the buy and ask points. You can't go further into the order book because the minute you plow beneath, let's call $200 the highest bid, then people who had bids at $200 are going to wonder how to price went to $195 without their order being filled.

The funds can be sent but they are contingent on the first transaction confirming first. It's mostly a convenience feature. As far as double spending goes, it's not really a huge risk anyway, and sending contingent funds doesn't really elevate the risk either.

Best to think of it in terms of new fiat coming into bitcoin on the exchanges. That flow is counterbalanced in a large part by the flow of newly minted coins.

OK, thanks. I think we are talking about different things. I'm aware that coins are managed in large chunks of varying security levels. My question is whether the number of bitcoins on hand = the bitcoin liabilities that they owe to their customers (i.e. deposits). Asked in another way, I was referring to them taking some portion of the customers' coins and using it on other things (i.e. business development, salaries, legal, lending it out etc.)

In my experience, however, people who write this kind of letter can let their emotions get the better of them, and after getting such a loan, it's not uncommon for them to feel better, kick back, and maybe spend a little on a small vacation... the next thing you know it's two years later and they still don't have anything with which to pay you back.

A lucky general can get hammered before a battle, tell an infantryman to go scout for the night, then wake up with a hangover to discover that the infantryman managed to assassinate the adversary.  
  
A good general will plan to the smallest detail, go to bed early, and not wake up because some 17-year old infantryman was told by a drunk general to see what he could see.

Hey Justus. I really enjoyed your post. What always seemed a relevant thought experiment to me was to envision the threshold between the lowest fee transition and all of the zero-fee transactions after it, and examine what might move that line, and why, and whether it should. Do you think that it is worth looking at the transaction priority equation (high fees, high output, and then age in the transaction pool) as a potential tinker point? Because frankly I don't see any problem with miners just deciding which transactions to include, as it works today.  
  
Anyway, looking forward to parts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

Sounds kind of like the labor theory of value, which has lots of holes. I recommend you check out Ludwig Von Mises and the subjective theory of value. He also has some good pieces on how money originates organically from the market place as a superior tradable good that bootstraps and then circulates accordingly.  
  
In some ways, yes, money is time. But it's only because creating value for others takes time and effort, whether you are turning wood into a table, or just thinking through a problem to arrive at a solution. Money is a way to lock up a certain amount of value until you feel like spending it on something. It's like a time agnostic value lock... Or something.

"If replay protection is designed and the less-popular chain continues to be supported with no sign of being abandoned, we intend to release a separate breadwallet app that is designed to work only with the less-popular chain so users can access their funds on that chain."

Not sure if you noticed, but Voisine *is* bread wallet. You're getting it from the horse's mouth. Aaron's wallet does its best to eliminate users managing addresses and private keys, while keeping their coins secure. It might feel a bit weird letting these things stay under the hood, but you get used to it after a while. But as he warns, for large sums, manage your private keys in cold storage for the time being.

I'm sure that's just a typo, but I really like the way it sounds :-)  
  
EDIT: Also, I completely agree. And when such a collapse does take place, I'm sure that Bitcoin will be blamed for bringing it about because, you know, the global financial system was obviously fine until somebody wrote a few hundred lines of code and sent it to his cryptography buddies.
@_date: 2016-01-08 12:38:48
Pretty sure it's not possible to procure exponential gains with linear losses, unless you are buying call options on margin. But in that case you need a significant move upwards just to cover your premium. Also, with leverage, you get to zero before the asset gets to zero. That's just the way it works. Either you are under educated in this matter, or you are being deceitful. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 12:25:03
While I agree with you that these financial instruments are good  options to build wealth, I wouldn't say that they are necessarily available to the impoverished. I think OP's point was that lottery tickets are one of the only options available to them.  
  
With $10, you won't be able to open a brokerage account to by stocks it bonds, and you certainly won't be able to afford a down payment or get a mortgage. But you *can* trade that $10 for bitcoin, which is not only a better option, but might actually be a fantastic one.  
  
If this is what OP was implying then I'd probably agree.

There wouldn't really be a need to perform an "attack." By simply leaving the minority coin alone, it would grind the new blocks to a halt.  
  
Keep in mind that hashing difficulty adjusts based on the processing power of its miners. Being a big fish in a small pond only helps you if a) you can get through two weeks of slower blocks and b) you can sell your mined coins at a profit. I'm not sure which of the two poses a bigger threat but I believe they both = abandon shorter chain for the longer one. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 23:42:13

Not really. That's an incremental database improvement. Sovereign money is much more disruptive. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 05:23:52
I'd agree. But efforts to persuade individual miners out of those pools has clearly failed. The only backstop against the miners is users via coin price, not exchanges and businesses. The price of BTU vs. BTC would determine the majority of hash rate.  
  
Let's both hope that it's grandstanding. Because at the moment it seems pretty serious!

Many in this thread might be interested to read up on Mises' Subjective Theory of Value. As it turns out, all value is subjective, meaning that given two things, one or the other may be preferred based on the individual choosing them, indeed it can even vary within the individual at different times.  
  
Not only is all value subjective, but we can't actually quantify how much more valuable something is than another, only that it is preferred. Part of the issue is that as things are accumulated, they have less and less incremental value to the accumulator, and thus 10 apples is not necessarily twice as valuable as 5 apples, even though it is double the quantity.  
  
All this stuff if super interesting and I'm not doing it justice in this thread. But I welcome any discussion on the topic.   
 
TL;DR: All value is subjective. The marketplace serves to swap items of greater and less utility as subjectively defined by the actors.

We'll see. With one chain outpacing the other for at least two weeks or so, I can't see miners hanging on to the minority fork for very long. Not to mention that the exchange markets would very quickly heavily favor one or the other in terms of price, further pushing the miners to abandon one chain for the other.  
  
Bottom line is that two forks of Bitcoin would be super unstable and probably not sustainable for long. One would go away.

To be fair, "intrinsic value" is a terrible term that really should be replaced by others when appropriate. In this case I would simply say "other use cases."  
  
Other times, people mean "intrinsic value" to be that it was hard to find or produce, in which case I would call it "scarce" or "difficult to find or produce."  
  
And yet other times people mean "intrinsic value" to be the opposite of "subjective value," of which there are no actual real world examples, since all value is subjective. Nothing has "value" in and of itself, value is only expressed through preferential trading by individuals.

I believe in economics the only proper application of the term would be to a financial asset such as a stock, bond, or real estate. Not sure if you could apply it to a currency.

That's not the point at all. The point is that given a fixed price (i.e. A shilling) people will spend the shillings comprised of less valuable metals. There is no equivalent fixed price with Bitcoin, and your analogy doesn't hold water.  
  
Furthermore, there is no way to reliably predict what the value of something will be in the future. So establishing which money is "going up" vs "going down" is less straightforward than you claim. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 12:28:23
The answer is no. Even in your scenario of hoarding only, we need greater transaction capacity. 10 years of ~3 tps almost gets us to a billion transactions. Shorten the timeframe or assume more hoarders and 1mb is vastly inadequate. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 00:36:08

Points 1-4: If applied to North Korea would lead you to conclude that the free market can't to anything at all. Just because the government fills a role today doesn't mean it does so better than the free market.  
  
Point 5: This is debatable.  
  
"Market failure" is largely a myth. In general, the worst thing a business man can do is convince you to buy his stuff, and you'd only do so if you thought it made you better off. If you'd like to list some examples of market failure I can counter with why they are actually state failure, or not a failure at all.

breadwallet works on Android too so you could recover with another device that is not an iPhone. If you are tech savvy, a little google searching in BIP39 would allow you to access your coins without any phone at all, although this is not recommended.

These are great questions.   
 
Regarding the malware, breadwallet keeps your private keys in the secure enclave, which is essentially a built-in hardware wallet in your iPhone. Because of app sand boxing, it is highly unlikely that malware exists which can screen capture from other apps. 
  
Regarding relying on breadwallet, you aren't. They use BIP39 to generate private keys and addresses from your recovery phrase. This standard is well documented and if Bread disappeared tomorrow your coins would still be safe. 
  
Also, breads software is open sourced, and has been audited by hundreds of other developers. You can even check it out yourself. 
  
If you have the 12 words, you can load them into breadwallet on any phone. So you don't need the "same" wallet so to speak.

Bitcoin has a habit of surprising everybody.  
  
As soon as everybody thinks that bitcoin is in a bear market that will take years to dig out of, we go from $800 to $3,400 in 6 months.

The aggregate cost basis between the two coins should be your original cost basis. You can do this by assigning a cost basis of 0 to your BCH and retaining the original basis for BTC, or splitting 50/50. Just need to be consistent.

I assume you sent the coins post-fork? If so, that's pretty interesting. It would imply a replay issue. Is anybody else experiencing something similar?
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:38:24
You are correct. The mistake objectors make is that they don't play the tape forward far enough. The money gets hoarded. OK. Then what? The value goes up. OK. Then what? People hoard it more? OK. Then what? At some point this feedback loop stops, because the value of money can't go to infinity. And as the rate of value increases slows, other economic opportunities become more attractive comparatively. Not only that, but as your wealth increases, your discretionary budget goes up in real terms, and so people are likely to spend *more* and not less under these circumstances. This is called the wealth effect and the Fed encourages its use through the boosting of housing prices. It applies to money as well as real estate. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:27:15

That's right. A miner gets to actively decide what to include in their block. Most just go with ordering based on when they see the transactions, and prioritizing the highest fee transactions. So their blocks will look similar, but not identical, to other miners who are working on the same block. A miner can do whatever they want, even mine blocks with no transactions.

@_date: 2017-08-03 18:57:03
Yeah, you're going to have to go straight to the tax expert on that one ;)  
  
For the heck of it, here's a little analysis I did and shared with some friends:  
  
"Intuitively, something you own is doubling, and therefore something else needs to halve to account for it.
Specifically, if you split your coins into two nominally equal piles, each with its own floating value, then you must halve the cost basis that you paid for the original "zygote."
The principal I'm employing is one of comparative tax liability given a certain absolute gain. Let's look at some examples (prices are just illustrative).
Ex 1:
You buy 1 BTC at $1,000. Current BTC value is $2,750. Coin splits. New BTC value $2,500, BCH value $250.
Sell before split: $1,750 in taxable capital gains. 
Sell after the split: New cost basis of $500. $2,000 liability from sale of BTC and $250 loss from sale of BCH. Aggregate liability for taxable capital gains = $1,750.
Ex 2: 
You buy 1 BTC at $1,000. Current BTC value is $2,750. Coin splits. New BTC value $2,750, BCH value $2,750.
Total gain in position due to coin split is now $5,500. If this gain had occurred before the split and you sold then, your taxable liability would be $4,500.
Sell after the split: New cost basis of $500. $2,250 liability from sale of BTC and $2,250 liability from sale of BCH = $4,500.
This equivalence holds regardless of the price of BTC and BCH"
@_date: 2017-03-02 21:44:50


  
I disagree with that *except* for the liberate part.  
  
The liberation is one from a currency that surreptitiously leaks value, that steals from its holders, such as the Venezuelan Bolivar. Or, to a lesser extent, the USD.  
  
Bitcoin is meant to be the only money that respects its holders. Nothing else compares.  
  


  
Nothing does. Look up the subjective theory of value. But, taking your claim sincerely, what is the "floor" that gold use provides? What is the minimum created from its attractive visual aspects and industrial uses? Maybe $10 per ounce. So you still need to account for the ~$1,200 of monetary value piled on top of what you dub "intrinsic" value.  
  
Also, thanks for posting! We're likely headed for another bubble, but bitcoin is, for better or worse, [the beautiful bubble machine](

3) Profit...?  
  
The honest answer is that we think bitcoin is going to be huge, and people need an easy way to use it. Current model is taking fair commission on brokered 3rd party services (I.e. Buy bitcoin) and expanding those services as the industry grows. We don't collect any of the regular transaction fees.

This is a great question! It's also the reason we have blocks at all. Blocks are designed to permit one individual the right to determine the ordering of all transactions since the last block, and to set that record in stone going forward.  
  
In the example you gave, whatever lucky miner found that block would reconcile the balances to determine whether Bob's money goes to Alice or to George. It would likely be whatever transaction that miner saw first. The double-spend would be rejected and go back to Bob's wallet.

No, he's right. I had a few as well. Rates maxed out yesterday before the loan book was cleared out completely.   
  
u/radressss, as long as your borrower is hanging onto the loan, you'll get 5% per day. But they can close it at any time.  
  
Edit: Of course since it's your first time lending you probably didn't realize that your borrower is going to get the BCH that splits off from the BTC you leant them. No biggie, you still got paid a pretty penny.

People need to accumulate large sums of dollars for all sorts of reasons, many that even yourself would have to admit are not "nutty" such as saving for a down payment.  
  
Every dollar is being help by somebody - So cumulatively it is indeed disrespectful of its holders. To use your ice cream analogy, it would be like handing the ice cream to a new person over and over.

Hi, u/trilli0nn. I know you want an answer *now* but the reality is that we're actively working through the implications of SegWit2x. Today, yes, that is how the app would behave based on its design. We never envisioned Bitcoin having the minority hash power under any circumstances. But here we are...  
  
Further research needs to be done on how the DNS seeds might overlap. The resolution of this would likely be a "peg and stay" feature. But again, we're working on it. I understand if you are not satisfied with the speed at which we are communicating, but rest assured there will be a user-friendly solution. As always, our primary concerns are the safety of customer funds, user control, and user choice. This means that even if the default is to stick with Bitcoin, that there may be an option for users to peg to 2x as well. But again, I have to stress this, we're not done planning.  
  
As always, thanks for your feedback.

I can see you are upset. But your claim that users will lose funds is clearly false. Your keys, your coin. In addition, SegWit2x detractors have an enormous incentive to access their "altcoins" as you put it, so they can sell them for the "real bitcoin."  
  
You should demand from all wallets the ability to access SegWit2x coins. Why would you use a wallet that doesn't facilitate that?

I agree. The problem is that the euro snapped a bunch of countries to the same monetary base and interest rates. Formerly profligate countries immediately felt the pinch and didn’t have enough time to adjust before asking for loans from their neighbors. Now everybody distrusts one another, and the tension continues. A grassroots global hard money standard would be much easier to swallow, since it starts with the wealth and adoption of citizens, vs the state.

But the odds of finding a palindrome, for instance, would be the same as finding any given string of length [address length]/2, so something like 16 characters. If I'm not mistaken, finding a desired string of that length would be 58^16 (number of available characters to the 16th power). That's a really big number!

Even economists conflate the two meanings. And to make matters more complicated, they sometimes attribute price increases to inflation while other times to demand. For instance, is the Dow at 19,000+ a symptom of inflation, or business activity?  
  
We could probably quibble all day, but I'll add one more: given your definitions, which I agree with, Bitcoin won't experience a contraction in money supply until lost coins exceeds newly minted coins. And even then it will be very modest. That contrasts with fiat currency, which can contract *massively* during a credit crisis. You probably know this although I'll mention it for others who are unaware, but fiat is created through loans, and likewise is destroyed when a loan gets paid off. So mechanically, paying off a $200,000 mortgage is like destroying (almost) $200,000 in the economy in general.  
  
In conclusion, deflation is a *huge* risk in a fiat based economy. Not so wth Bitcoin, which is much more stable in supply. Thanks for engaging!

@_date: 2016-12-10 18:35:00
Yeah, I see what you are saying, but I would still disagree. There are really two types of deflation: price deflation and monetary deflation. They are rated but not the same thing. Prices aren't guaranteed to go down in Bitcoin, but they *likely* will. If an economy that uses Bitcoin had no growth in goods and services then the prices would be quite stable, for instance.

You could start your phrase with "satoshi" and then choose the next 10 words randomly, and then try random words until the checksum works. Then you would have a vanity address with satoshi that is secure. Bottom line: a phrase with satoshi is not rare. Probably not any more useful than a totally random phrase either since you would never sell nor exchange a recovery phrase!

Yes, the problems are scalable. They are very similar to rolling a die and trying to get a "1". If the die has 6 sides, this is really easy, and happens pretty frequently. When more people come to play, the dice start to grow from 6 sides to 10 or 20 or 50 sides.  
  
Bitcoin miners are essentially rolling 100 trillion sided dice looking for a 1. That's not exactly how it works, but it's close enough. In reality, the dice are already super *duper* big, and the target that you are trying to get under gets lowered more and more, but that's just details.

Like the other guy said, try BRD. You can buy bitcoin and then keep it under your control.
@_date: 2019-02-20 18:18:24
Trezor uses BIP39 too I think. BRD was one of the earlier wallets and helped establish the BIP39 standard and word list - but a lot other wallets chose different standards and derivation paths. If BRD disappeared tomorrow, your BRD app would still be on your phone and work fine - there just wouldn't be any more updates. If somehow you don't have access to your app, you can always use Ian Coleman's open sourced tools to strip the private keys. Hope that helps!
@_date: 2019-02-20 21:12:20
We would really discourage you from putting your seed phrase into another wallet - since we can't vouch for their security, only our own. There isn't really a realistic scenario where BRD would just disappear. Not only is the derivation path open sourced and clearly defined, but our software is open sourced too. I guess I just fail to see a scenario where people would actually lose access to their coins. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:14:14
You and me, we’re old friends. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 15:23:43
But 47 trillion + 6.3 trillion = 53.3 trillion. 5% of 53.5 trillion is 2.7 trillion. 2.7 trillion / 21 million = $128,500. Not $2.5 million.
@_date: 2019-02-20 22:33:26




  
  
Yeah, that all sounds reasonable to me. I'll talk to the product team about adding some language to that effect. It might change over time as new wallets pop up, but for now it seems true that BRD's derivation is relatively unique. As you can imagine, we don't spend a lot of time figuring out how to get our customers' money into other wallets. It's usually the other way around!

@_date: 2017-11-23 22:32:03
You’re right. If one sees the BTC/BCH competition as a zero sum game (which it isn’t, but is arguably pretty close), then the rational investor who wants to be perfectly hedged will purchase equal parts (not equal dollar amounts) BTC and BCH, regardless of what happened in the past.

This is entirely accurate. It's happened to me before.  
  


  
Whether or not I want it, I think this is the most likely scenario. When you ask me to think about if we'd ever call 2x bitcoin, I have to wonder: OK, let's say it's 6 months past the fork, and 95% of the general population is calling 2x bitcoin. Should we? Would we? I honestly don't know the answer to that question at this time - but by not ruling out the possibility, it's still a far cry from an endorsement of doing so. Know what I mean?

@_date: 2015-08-11 14:57:36
Again, I would refer you to mining pools, because this is exactly what they do in terms of splitting the spoils.  
  
Also, keep in mind that the resources are being thrown at the network in order to win the block reward. The 1MB is just a cap on how quickly the blockchain can grow, and really has nothing to do with the resources. Whether the cap were 1MB or 1GB, it wouldn't really matter to miners right now.  
  
However, as the block reward decreases, transaction fees will become more important over time. But for now, it's all about that 25BTC.
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:01:09
Hi nanomind. I think I understand what you are saying, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll try and answer the best I can. 
  
It seems that you are discussing something between decreasing the block discovery time to 1 minute and splitting individual blocks into bite-sized chunks. There are a few things to note about this.  
  
First, decreasing block discovery time without increasing block size is a viable discussion. However, using the example you gave, it would be functionally equivalent to increasing the block size to 10MB. There are some minor differences in terms of network propagation and block orphan rate, but overall the effect would be roughly the same.  
  
To your second point, there is no way to really split a block into pseudo mini-blocks. These would just be new blocks. Plus, you would want to split the block reward (currently 25 BTC every ~10 minutes) into 2.5 BTC per block. Again, doable, but doesn't really change anything except for effective block size.
  
You seem to be making a third point about letting the little guy have a piece of the action. There is literally nothing in the way of anybody being a Bitcoin miner. It is one of the most democratized playing fields ever. Indeed, many of the "big" miners today were once broke hobbyists tinkering with mining rigs. In terms of "spreading out" the payments, it is done completely fairly, with those contributing larger amounts of hashing power receiving larger payouts. If you only have enough mining power to find 1 block per year, then join a mining pool, and get 0.48 BTC per week instead of waiting for 25 BTC once every ~365 days. What you get out is related to what you put in, kind of like a relationship, I'm told...
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:01:24
Sure, happy to oblige. The app will have a warning 2 days before the fork informing users of the disruption, and then a new warning during the fork telling users not to use the app. During this time, the app will display their bitcoin balance, which will not change, whether it is talking to a 2x node or a bitcoin node. This warning will persist until the outcome of the fork is clear, at which point we'll launch the coin splitting function. We won't spend the resources to make a 2X logo inside the app unless it survives.

Also, we [hate high fees]( It pisses off our customers. Not sure why you think we would want to make them higher. We have no affiliation with any miners whatsoever. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:52:31
It was actually somebody (in fact multiple people, since this happened more than once) buying the pizza with fiat, and accepting BTC from Laszlo. One guy who accepted the BTC is a damn fine human being and has done great things in the bitcoin world since then.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:42:31
Yeah. Tap the balance to toggle between bits (1 bitcoin = 1,000,000 bits) and Euro.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:11:11
She did? I looked again but I can’t see anything about the price, only a general comment that owning a single bitcoin will always be the privilege of a lucky few. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:17:43
We won’t change your coins. In fact, we can’t. There will be two chains, and you’ll have the same number of coins on both. Whether both chains survive is yet to be determined, and certainly not up to us. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:16:18
If you are on Android, updating to the new version gives you the option of regular vs. economy fees.

Makes no sense. The cost of mining *follows* the market price, not vice versa. The only effect of mining on price is the inflation rate.

@_date: 2017-11-02 12:42:36
Yes, that's correct. However the ability to see both balances in Bread will take a little time after the fork. You'll still be the owner of the private keys, but right now Bread can only look at one chain at a time.
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:03:36
Bold move. You are telling me that [this guy is dead?]( No need to tell me I don't deserve to live. I'm just calling you a liar, that's all.

You, sir, are ready for bitcoin. Strap in!
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:23:32
I think you mean (n!-1)/n!. Your example is actually ~~diverging from 1~~ converging on 0 instead of 1:  
  
n=2: 0.5  
n=3: 0.33  
n=4: 0.25  
  
etc.  
  
EDIT: Divergent, diverging, diversion, whatever. 
 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:03:25

@_date: 2017-11-07 19:20:10
Ah, well if they decide to ignore the warning and use the app anyway, then it depends what the person sends them. If the person ends up sending both BTC and BCH because there is no replay protection, then yes the balance will update regardless of which chain they are looking at. But if they send only one of those, then it may or may not show up.  
  
I agree this is not ideal. But the ***ery will be temporary. A short time after the fork, users will be able to split their coins and see exactly how much of both they have, provided 2x survives. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:49:47
“Lol can u get me in on the Ponzi scheme op.”  
  
Lol indeed. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:40:31
Bcash changed their PoW so that they could adjust the difficulty and survive, so Bread ignored it by default. We had to specifically build the BCH withdrawal functionality.  
  
I think it's pretty clear that Bitcoin is "Bitcoin" unless the Core chain somehow dies from the fork (highly, highly, unlikely, but not a 0% chance). And even if that were to happen I'm not sure whether people would call the remaining chain Bitcoin or something else.  
  
If both chains survive, we'll figure out replay protection and list them as separate coins. But there's no use in spending resources to make a "Bitcoin 2x" logo in the app right now, particularly if the initiative is short-lived.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:17:23

Hmm. Sounds annoying. Mind sending an email to support with more details? They can take care of your there.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:30:50
Try the economy option. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 22:01:19
Think of the lottery like looking for a needle in a haystack. Some miners are using their hands, and others have special machinery to sift through the hay faster. Then, every ten minutes, somebody finds a needle. They then get the honor of submitting the next block in the chain, as well as a reward (currently 25 BTC) and any transaction fees from the transactions they are confirming.  
  
Then, every two weeks or so, the all the miners see if the average time has been less than 10 minutes or more than 10 minutes per block. If it has been less than 10 minutes per block, then they add more hay to make it harder to find needles.  
  
This is a rough analogy, but I hope it helps. Happy to clarify further.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:56:51

@_date: 2017-11-19 12:58:07
Have you tried Bread’s economy fee? It’s super low, but always confirms eventually. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:51:13
Yes, we will do that. It won't be available on day 1, but we have a plan in place.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:59:20
Never. I'll just keep earning and spending fiat, but never sell my BTC. How else am I supposed to get on the leaderboard?
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:09:56
We’re still working out the details, but a likely path would be an automated feature that sends a transaction with your whole balance to a fresh address under your control. Then, once the tx confirms on one chain, it will quickly send a second tx with a higher fee to a new address. The the coins are split. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:50:19
Yes. BTC and B2X share the same addresses, so the private keys that are stored on your phone can access the coins on either chain. We still need to build out the functionality within the app so you can see each chain independently, but even before we do so, you'll "own" coins on both chains.
@_date: 2015-08-15 01:47:05

@_date: 2017-11-16 04:44:13
You're right, it doesn't take $1B invested in bitcoin to increase the "market cap" by $1B. This is because of how markets work, and in your example stocks are no different. At any given time, only a small fraction of the asset is traded on an exchange, and it's there that the market price is established. The less of the asset on the exchange, the less money it takes to move the price, both up, and down.  
  
Hope that helps.

Because I don't know how creative you want me to be. You say, realistic, so perhaps you can outline what you think is a realistic outcome.  
  
I can't know what you mean unless you are more specific. Are we talking about situations where the core chain dies, 2x survives, Jeff Garzic says sorry and begs forgiveness from the Core Devs, and 10-20 of them forgive him and continue developing the 2x chain?

This might actually be more appropriate for r/relationships or r/personalfinance (if they don't remove your post for mentioning bitcoin). I also didn't say anything about BTC to my then-girlfriend, and brought it up shortly after we were married. Although we make major financial decisions together, we kind of have an unspoken rule that our individual investments, or money or stock options we bring in from our separate jobs (she is also employed) are managed by that person - including decisions of whether to sell or diversify.  
  
I can't really offer any advice other than to first establish an idea about what *you* want to do with the coin, and then pitch it to your wife. If she agrees, great. Happy wife, happy life. If she doesn't agree, then you'll have to work it out in your own way.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:25:07
It's simple accounting. They just credit you the same balance of BTC and B2X. It doesn't involve any blockchains.

Keep in mind that even if you are looking at the 2x chain, that a transaction during this period will be replayed on the main chain too. I agree that the fork will cause confusion and is a terrible thing in general, but it certainly doesn't make Bread untrustworthy.  
  
Plus, tether to a node!
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:21:38
You’re not alone. The whole thing is a bit complicated, particularly because nobody knows exactly what will happen, so there are a lot of “if” “if” “if”s. Unlike BCH, this is not a clean split. Both the Core and 2X chains will be competing to attract miners. Miners will predominantly mine the chain with the higher coin value. If one of those chains loses enough miners, it’s transactions will get backloggged and it will be difficult for people to use reliably. If the coin values are similar enough, then both chains will survive long enough to get through their transaction backlog (I’m simplifying a little but this is the gist). Regardless of whether 2 or 1 chain survives, you’ll have coins on that/those chains. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:20:18

Hi, u/toracs. Thanks for the question. Provided both chains survive the fork, we're planning on offering a coin split option.

@_date: 2015-08-11 11:02:06
What you described is changing the variance of the payouts. This means that the overall rate of payouts is the same (I.e. 3,600 new bitcoins per day) but they they are disbursed at a more even pace. 
  
This is already being achieved today by miners joining a mining pool. Every time their pool finds a block, they are rewarded a fraction of it based on how much hashing power they are contributing. 
  
Hope that helps.

Normal users want the facts, not posturing. It doesn't matter what Bread wants or believes - this fork is likely to happen and people need to know the mechanics.

@_date: 2017-11-01 19:21:49
It really goes to the design of the wallet. Bread is one of the few pure SPV apps, meaning it connects directly to the Bitcoin network. We don't run *anything* through servers. If we did, then we could simply keep our servers on 0.15 and be done with it - but we won't, because we refuse to spy on our customers.  
  
SPV needs to establish consensus which it does by examining cumulative proof of work. This works great 99.9% of the time. It's only during 51% mining events or attacks when the model gets funky.  
  
We aren't baiting anybody, nor are we switching. The app is designed to follow hash rate as a trade off between validation and being lightweight. We are dead-set on serving the needs of our customers first, and this fork is tricky enough that the best course of action is simply "do nothing" during the contentious period.  
  
That said, we are open to feedback! If you have a recommendation for how we can handle this fork better, we are all ears.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:38:43
If two chains survive we will. Looking at a way to split with RBF post fork. But you are right in that splitting coins won’t be available until a little while after the fork.

Yes, that’s true. I guess I meant two things by spam: the noun and the verb. Spam itself would be rampant if fees were zero - people used to send random amounts to other accounts with marketing messages in the OP Return. 
  
But spam the verb, which I probably should have called clog, can make regular transactions more expensive. It is much much easier to accomplish this if blocks are small. If blocks fit 10 transactions per second, A bad actor has to spend a maximum of $100 per block to make fees $10 per tx. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:52:19
Homework for today is to look up the Forex market, and ask yourself why there are exchanges set up for trading what amounts to numbers on a computer (i.e. dollars, euros, yen).  
  


  
It's not. That's a secondary benefit to its main function, which is a superior store of value, which I think you started to riff on towards the end of your post.  
  
In the distant future, as more money moves into bitcoin exchanges, the volatility will likely decrease, and bitcoin will enter a golden age of steadily rising value commensurate with the growth of goods and services in the world. I think. But what do I know? I'm just a guy on reddit.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:08:29
I think it’s worth pointing out that smaller blocks = less spam, but that smaller blocks also = cheaper to spam. By example, if blocks only processed 10 transactions, it would be trivial for a spammer to shut out legitimate transactions for a prolonged period of time. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:44:46

Look, I know the fork is a big deal, and everybody is on edge. Honestly, your first comment was frustrating because I really felt it misrepresented what was in the post. I engaged with you because I'm interested in a dialogue. Too often, the internet is a place where people talk past each other, and I wish it weren't so.  
  
Believe it or not, I'm a lot like you. I got involved with bitcoin in 2011 and I love it dearly. Not that you should feel sorry for us, but do you actually think we like these forks? It's terribly disruptive and getting in the way of much better things to come in the future. 
  
I know you want me to say unequivocally that there is one true Bitcoin, and I'm happy to do so. But I hope you can see the difficulty in doing so when you ask "under any circumstances" and then I give you a potential edge case and you say that it's ridiculous. That should give you your answer. If I would only call 2X bitcoin under circumstances that you think are ridiculous, then you should interpret that as a "no" rather than a "yes."

If both chains survive, you'll have both coins. If one chain survives, you'll have that coin. During the fork *nobody* using any wallet should be making transactions.

Actually, there is. Your receive addresses are derived from the recovery phrase.

If you send BTC with *any* wallet, you'll send both BTC and B2X. We're no different in that respect. And no, we won't automatically call B2X bitcoin - that's more a quirk of how SPV wallets work. We're putting out a second blog post soon which will have practical information about what to expect and what options that customers have.

Well, that settles it. I finally found what to put on my tombstone. And not just your tag, I mean your whole comment. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:39:39
A few high level comments: Do banks extract value from clients, or exchange money for services? Are these services worthwhile?  
  
Regarding Coinbase etc. You are referring to the exchange industry in general, which is a well-established business model of creating a market place for different items. Just because bitcoin is traded on an exchange doesn't mean that bitcoin itself isn't independent from traditional banking. Pork belly futures are traded on exchanges, but the farming industry is quite distinct from banking, for instance.  
  
Last, I don't think she used the term "pay-to-play" correctly. Just because a business charges money to clients doesn't make it pay-to-play. Your local diner isn't pay-to-play. It's just pay-to-eat.

He's right, but it says nothing about bitcoin.  
  
My father is about the same age as yours with similar investment philosophies. It took me about 3 months to convince him. 
  
I asked him what eventually changed his mind, so your father might want to hear about it from a peer: "everything is moving together now: stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. it's really hard to find uncorrelated returns. That, and bitcoin being such an asymmetric bet, something that *can* go up 100x, makes it attractive to me as an alternative investment."

@_date: 2017-11-03 19:21:49
Presumably it would be in your Bread, but since you're not seeing the transaction you won't be able to find it. I would send support the receive address that you gave Coinbase. That will allow them to find the txid.  
  
EDIT: Wrong exchange!
@_date: 2019-02-20 19:31:07
OK, that's good to know. Regardless of the standard that's being used, if you want to move money between wallets it's probably a good idea to use different seed phrases for security reasons. The reason that it would be tough to move to a new standard is all the existing users who have already backed up their BIP39 paper keys, and having multiple formats would mean longer syncing times - and we know that people hate syncing.  
  
After doing some more digging, it looks like Greenaddress also uses BIP39 on iOS.

It’s true that the full amount of new coins must be “absorbed.” If a miner chooses to spend $50,000 on mining bitcoin but keeps the bitcoin, that’s still $50,000 invested in bitcoin that could have otherwise been spent elsewhere. 
As for miners mining, many lose money on their initial investment, but they will continue to mine as long as the marginal cost of running electricity is exceeded by the value of the new coins. I’m not convinced of conspiracies regarding miners mining at a marginal loss.

I think that SPV wallets such as breadwallet that connect directly to the Bitcoin network are a better alternative. No downtime and you still get to hold your own keys. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:01:02
True. The best comparison would be M0 or cash and cash equivalents. Those are the non-debt based versions of fiat money. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:33:40
Check your App Store tomorrow. For sure the new version will be available to you by then.  
  
I think you’re confused about a number of things. I don’t understand your comment about everybody wanting to get paid, first of all. Also:  
 


  
Fees are a function of transaction size (sat/byte) not value. I am happy to explain further if you like  or you can google it to improve your understanding. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:07:17
You could. But while your miners are shut off you're not only losing money, you're going to be waiting even longer for the difficulty to adjust downward. Miners always have an incentive to mine if it's profitable.

Hey jesset77, are you a core Dev? I have an idea I call "roving blocks" that I wanted to run by somebody who knows the code base. Essentially, instead of storing all blocks back to the genesis block, full nodes could operate by only storing the most recent 100 blocks or so, with some special management of the UXTOs. It would do away with a lot of blockchain bloat, unless of course it's a crackpot idea...
@_date: 2019-12-09 18:43:55
BRD + Cryptosteel. Then wipe the wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:09:04
During a resync, it takes a few hours before the app gets into recent history - so your transactions won't show up until near the end. I really think a full sync, with the phone plugged in, uninterrupted, and the app open will solve your problem. (but listen to support since they know better than I do).
@_date: 2017-04-14 01:41:43
Counterintuitively, larger blocks makes spam more expensive. The cost of overwhelming a block goes up. Cheap spam is the threat, which is more easily accomplished with small blocks. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:12:07
I see where you are coming from, but you are ignoring the marginal effect of trading. Much less than $6B worth of bitcoin went *into* the alts in the first place. It's likely less than 10% of that, maybe even 5%. So let's say $300M went into alts to pump them up to $6B.  
  
That means that there could be as much as 300,000 BTC worth of value waiting to come back. Still substantial, but much less than the 1.6M in your first estimate.
@_date: 2017-04-15 23:48:47

Yes, I suppose that's a possibility. If that were to actually happen though I think the Core community would do an emergency hard fork to shorten the difficulty retargeting. It's not something to be done lightly, but it would fix the problem.

@_date: 2016-02-08 13:07:10
Agreed. The iPhone makes for a great bitcoin storage device. It's malware hardened and the keys sign transactions in the secure enclave. As long as you have your breadwallet passphrase safely written down, it should be near impossible for somebody to seal your coins. Really no limit to how much you can store safely. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 13:40:16


  
This is a somewhat loaded question, I think. What is missing is the project management component.

Correct. Cash, or M0, or high powered money, whatever you want to call it, is not inherently limited in supply. It is, however, not debt based, like bank credit. Splitting hairs though.
@_date: 2017-04-19 16:55:16
Your balance and transactions will always remain private. The only loss of anonymity is that vendors who source the bitcoin will have a record of bitcoin purchases that you make through the app, which is necessary from a customer service perspective in case there is some technical issue that needs to be resolved.

If I'm not mistaken, Apple has been very outspoken about their refusal to include cryptographic backdoor access to anybody, including the NSA and themselves. So if that's true, and I think there is a lot of evidence that it is, then yes, your coins would be safe from Apple too.
@_date: 2017-04-08 23:07:41
They did. Regardless of which chain is dominant, if two survive you'll have access to both chains. 
  
"If the less-popular chain continues to be supported with no sign of being abandoned, we intend to release a separate breadwallet app that is designed to work only with the less-popular chain so users can access their funds on that chain."
  
@_date: 2017-04-14 01:36:53
Yes. If you activate a soft fork with minority hashing power, it becomes a hard fork. 
  
The only way to establish economic majority is with two coins via a chain split, unfortunately.

What happened to Naspers? Or platinum?
@_date: 2017-04-10 02:15:37
Yeah I'm with you buddy. Regardless of which camp one identifies with, hashing power is pretty much the most important factor.  Now, owners do provide the final backstop by selling down a coin they dislike in the event of a fork, but only for the purpose of reestablishing the longest chain per their preference. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 00:20:18

If their coins are already on an exchange, they'll be credited coins on both chains and can trade them, even if transactions aren't clearing on the actual network at that time.

I started to make a rebuttal but the article is too long to address fully.  
  
TL;DR: The author clearly has a philosophy background, but limited understanding of pure mathematics. The author also leans on the labor theory of value and the intrinsic value of gold arguments to debunk bitcoin. Overall his writing tends to be accurate, but he gets caught in the semantic weeds enough to confuse himself and his readers.

The nonexistent buyers of the 25%.
@_date: 2016-02-23 15:36:53
Interesting idea. One issue would be that the 10% time reductions would quickly result in block generation of less than a minute, or even a second. This causes a new set of issues with orphans and propagation.

FYI bread gives you total control of your private keys. The app follows the longest chain because it's an SPV wallet but if there is a fork and two coins emerge, bread will supply two apps, one for each coin, for you to do as you wish with them.

Bitcoin price increases much less due to hodlers buying more than from new users entering the space. I suspect there is substantial pent up demand for bitcoin from this crowd, and the current scaling drama is only likely to stem the flow vs. stop it altogether. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:40:34
Not really a great comparison. VISAbux don't have a market cap of $207B, VISA shares do. VISA uses USD which has a "market cap" of $5-13T depending on how you count it.

Neat stuff. I wonder if you could split your required address lookups between 20-30 nodes with some overlap for validation. Almost like a privacy multi-sig.

Hi there. To your first point, the BRD team didn’t initiate all the Reddit posts - many were just regular users who picked up on our announcements on social. However, I am sensitive to the eye rolling and don’t want to give this subreddit the impression that we’re shotgunning the forums. On a slightly comical note, another highly rated comment in this thread is by somebody who’s never even heard of BRD. Not sure what to make of that - but at least the posts aren’t bugging everybody.   
  
To the compatibility point, it’s a little complex. First, we were one of the earliest wallets, and so the case could be made that the rest of the industry that followed is the party that chose to be incompatible. That said, we don’t prioritize compatibility because security is one of our specialties - in short, we don’t advocate using a seed phrase elsewhere because we can’t vouch for that service’s security measures. However, our code is open sourced, and while the derivation isn’t necessarily common it isn’t non-standard. As to the effect on fund recovery with other tools or wallets (and there are some that use BIP39) after Bech32 enablement, I’ve asked Aaron Voisine for the details since he’ll be able to provide the level of detail you’re asking for. 
  
Thanks for engaging. We’ll try to keep the BRD Reddit fatigue to a minimum.  
  
Edit: from Aaron Voisine “We’ve used the default bip32 path from the start. Our code is open source so anyone can build it themselves and recover. And any other tools that scan for the pubkey hash will find both types of outputs.”

Oh, no I didn’t mean that you were the risk. I meant that you could buy 2 BTC and have a “somewhat” risk free bet. The configuration would need to be slightly different. But there is a similar and somewhat famous bet you can make where you win either way. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:20:15
It probably depends on your expectations. It certainly doesn't enhance returns, but it can mitigate risk. For instance, a lot of people go all in towards the top of bitcoin bubbles. They would be much better served to dollar cost average through the cycle, don't you think?
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:58:18
Did you write down your 12-word recovery phrase? If so, you're good.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:55:37
I know. That was super disappointing. He seemed credible until he started spouting nonsense about price floors defined by the cost of mining. Shows he didn’t do his research. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:47:51
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:27:22
Yes, *but*, some services/exchanges can't send to Bech32 addresses yet. It's a good opportunity to reach out to them and request this feature, which is much easier to implement than full send+receive support. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 11:09:19
Definitely a scam. People lose their money in the end. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:28:33
That’s actually really encouraging to hear. As you can imagine, the costs of building and maintaining a wallet are incredibly frontoaded. We have some funding but we also need to keep our burn rate low enough to be around for a long time. We would *love* to release everything in our pipeline tomorrow, but we’re constrained by developer bandwidth and economic reality. 
  
It’s all in the works! Reach out to us anytime. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:09:59
We actually don’t run nodes. Bread connects directly to the bitcoin network to maintain your privacy. Hope that answers your question.

@_date: 2018-03-07 16:14:20
Hi, there. Yes, I saw this thread. There is a lot of negativity and I'm not sure my voice will make much of a difference. I wish it did. But for the record, I do want to say that the conspiracy theories are untrue. We're a business, and we set the development priorities based on customer feedback. Some things take longer than others and I think people read too much into the order in which we release features.   
  
The SegWit discussion has caused a lot of strife as well. We thought we were doing the right thing by scoping out the best optimizations possible, even though they will take longer than doing P2SH ASAP. But the reaction to our development plan was met with pretty strong opposition. I can't really blame the community - they fight the good fight. It just makes me sad that people think we don't care about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:37:46
That's a valid question. 2X is different because all bitcoin holders will also hold 2X coins. Understandably, everybody should want to have access to them, whether you intend to hold or sell them.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:06:48
Great requests. Duly noted!
@_date: 2018-11-09 21:18:15
We're working on it already. It's a big infrastructure play. The only requirement that we have before launching is that it's easy enough for grandma to use. Spoiler alert: It's going to be a little while. But we're serious about it.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:13:48
We support our customers. I know that sounds like a cop-out, but as an SPV wallet we need to be very thoughtful about how to handle a chain split so that nobody loses funds. We're not particularly excited about the confusion and mayhem ahead, but we'll be communicating our plan in advance of November for how customers will be affected by the split, and what choices they will have available to them.

Good data point. I'll ask our guys to shoot them a note on Twitter.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:48:56
We're actually comprised of a diverse group of people with varying opinions on the matter. What we do agree on is that customers should a) Not lose funds and b) Have a choice in what chain to follow. It's not a matter of transparency - sorry if it appears that way.  
  
Segwit support is on the way, however. Just needs to run through more development and QA.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:12:34
I think that's probably right. But why are you worried what I think? Obviously the community will call Bitcoin Bitcoin.

Lol. Glad to see you have a sense of humor. We actually have something in the works that's going to take syncing from hours to seconds. Sorry it's not available now, but syncing will soon be a thing of the past!

To operate privately, which is important to many people, you can send and receive directly from the splash screen.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:46:10
One thing that might work for you if you have a little time, is to delete the app, reinstall, resync (should take a few hours), and then *don't* enable the TouchID. A few people have experienced issues with the TouchID and we're still rooting out the cause.  
  
Of course, you shouldn't need to use it, but anytime you delete the app just double check that you have your 12-word recovery phrase written down safely.  
  
Apologies again for the trouble. Hopefully that fixes it.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:36:44
What you're missing is that you don't get to see our support tickets. The top request is for BCH support.  
  
Also, 0.15 still doesn't generate P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses, so your criticism can be equally levied against Core. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:13:56


  
Totally legitimate point. But demand for loans isn't going to be the banks' problem, it's demand for deposits, which they need to make the loans.

Thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:55:15
Oh, I see. Yes of course that's totally reasonable. Understanding which chain you are looking at is a must, as is having the ability to look at one or the other. Where it gets tricky is where there is no replay protection, there is a high chance your coins will move on *both* chains whenever you make a transaction on *either* chain, which is a serious issue that resides at the industry level, meaning that if you send funds with any wallet during the "danger" period then you risk losing funds. We're feverishly developing ways to reduce this risk within the app. It's a blunt tool, but the best course of action is to refrain from making any transactions from any wallet or exchange right after the fork until the situation resolves.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:18:12
That's very interesting. Thanks for the tip! We'll look into it.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:37:49

That’s hilarious. Can’t exchamge these bits for krone? Oh well. Guess I’ll just have to buy a lambo. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:40:58
If I'm not mistaken, it would be the receiver who would end up not getting paid (still not great), provided the transaction was not replayed, correct? If the hash rate bounces to the minority chain, the sender would find those funds waiting for them.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:28:10
Thanks, Greg. Aaron Voisine saw that last night but hasn't had a chance to respond. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:33:01

Good question. u/BreadCPO how are we looking on that?
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:24:36
It's the difference between addition and division.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:43:03
You’re right. It is. For the record, the Core client doesn’t produce P2SH-wrapped addresses yet either, so we’re not *too* behind the curve. Development just take time it’s that simple. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:00:26
Yeah stay tuned. We're working hard on it and will be releasing some detailed announcements soon. I hope you find them adequate for your needs.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:07:06

With all due respect, I think the premise of comparing the value of bitcoin to other assets is highly important. If 1 btc were worth 1 cent, there wouldn't be a whole lot you could to with it.

We'll always be a bitcoin wallet. We love bitcoin. We will likely also be a wallet for some other coins too.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:52:31
Yeah, good points. First, the lack of replay protection is a *huge* issue that we're hoping can be resolved beforehand. Without it there's going to be a mess across the industry.  
  
But to your question about supporting the fork, the reason is actually a bit subtle. If the 2x chain survives, it won't only be its followers who will demand access to it, it will also be the Core followers who want to get ahold of their 2x coins so that they can sell them for more legacy Bitcoin.  
  
We found it was the same with BCH. Literally all of our customers wanted access to it, regardless of whether they favored it or not. Kind of ironic.  
  
Also, keep in mind that "support" doesn't mean favor, nor does it mean "not supporting" something else. So I want to make that distinction so you understand I'm referring to technical support in this context.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:37:53
This is my personal opinion, but I think the only conditions under which that would happen would be 1) The original BTC chain somehow dies (highly unlikely, but theoretically possible) or 2) The 2x coin becomes significantly more valuable than the original bitcoin over a prolonged period of time, and the rest of the community starts calling it "bitcoin" for the sake of simplicity (also unlikely, but theoretically possible).  
  
We wouldn't just push the name "Bitcoin" on the 2x chain against the will of the broader community - it would have to be a natural conclusion of events.

Haha, well we're happy to be in the same crazy bitcoin boat as you, even though there seem to be multiple mutinies going on.  
  
I guess what you're saying is that if 99% of the world decides that something is bitcoin, but you disagree, then it's not bitcoin. And I'm fine with that, I just don't think it's practical. Bitcoin is as much a social as a technical construct.

@_date: 2018-02-13 13:28:48
I was just going off of data that I found googling "Percent of US millionaire households." 7% seems believable to me, although I wouldn't be surprised if there are a lot of stealth millionaires that don't get counted in that total. Equally, I wouldn't be surprised if most of those millionaires' wealth is in appreciated home values, meaning they don't actually have a lot of liquid assets.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:20:22
At the moment, the mechanics are more important than the semantics. But semantics are important too. A question for you, though. If Bitcoin needs to undergo an emergency hard fork to adjust the difficulty downwards so that it can propagate enough blocks, would you consider that a change of consensus rules?
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:14:29
Great article! Thanks for posting.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:08:15
This is the correct answer. And for any fork that survives with considerable support from users, we'll eventually provide full support within the app.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:23:00

Apologies if you think I've misquoted you. I'm genuinely trying to understand your objections.  
  
I leave you with one parting comment, however. You may think you only want access to the Bitcoin chain, but I guarantee you that if 2X survives, you'll be requesting access to those coins so that you can sell them. Just some food for thought.

Sorry, straight buy means keeping it in cash. It's a benchmark.  
  


  
Kind of depends what happens after that. There can be many large moves within a bull or bear market that don't necessarily turn the tide. A lot of it is only visible in the rearview mirror.  
  
There was no speak of selling or timing. This is simple DCA, buying the same amount in dollars on a regular basis.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:59:24
It’s safe at the moment. The fork will be in mid-late November. Hopefully the smoke will clear within a week after that. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:20:48
It's hard to plan for  without knowing how the chips will fall. It's highly possible that only one chain will survive after a period of price discovery and miner activity/switching.  and  seems like reasonable approaches. I wouldn't consider  on the table unless there were two, robust chains that existed independent of one another for a period of months - but I can't rule it out on that basis.  
  
It's a blunt tool, but the strong recommendation within the app that users do not make any transactions during the split phase is probably going to be an absolute requirement. After the dust settles we'll consider the options that serve our customers best, keeping in mind that our developers' time is an extremely tight and valuable resource. We don't want to build something unless we know it will be used.
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:12:37
Yes, you can use your 12 words to recovery the wallet. There is no need to make a new wallet unless a thief who has your phone knows *both* your phone pin and your breadwallet pin. Without either of these, those coins aren't going anywhere.

So true. But I think it really comes down to segwit. Ledger supports tons of other currencies, but they implemented segwit, and they don't seem to get any flak. If I could go back and do things differently, I think I'd just push for the P2SH version and get it out the door as quickly as possible.

Fiat is a crude indicator of bitcoin's value in general. It's not that bitcoin being worth $4,600 is important in and of itself, it's that it signifies what you can do with 1 btc.   
  
The more valuable that btc is, the more food it can buy a starving family in Venezuela. The more valuable that btc is, the more it empowers the individuals that believe in it and hold it. The more valuable that btc is, the more it frees people from the shackles of corrupt monetary systems. The more valuable that btc is, the more it threatens established national currencies and governments.  
  
If that's not what bitcoin is really about, then I guess I'm just as ignorant as you claim.

That's true. You could lose your 2x coin if the receiver doesn't accept or expect it. But if you send a btc transaction (using pretty much any wallet), that 2x coin is likely to go along too, yes?

Tainting seems like the only sure-fire way to get a clean split. It's easy for exchanges to do because they can add a single 2x-satoshi to their cold storage and are good to go. But how can we achieve this with hundreds of thousands of decentralized users? If it can be done elegantly we're totally open to it - just can't seem to find a straightforward solution.

Yes, we're going to support BCH functionality within the app similar to BTC. By the way, we do our best to communicate our plans for the future through our blog:  where we had 5 separate posts on BCH. We'll be doing the same for the 2x fork.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:34:02
Perhaps what we can agree on is that November is going to be an interesting time to be involved in bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:18:05


  
Yes you do. You'll own the keys to the same amount of coins on both chains. And Bread will give you access to them. It's true that around the time of the fork regular people shouldn't be making transactions, but advanced users can use our node tethering function to ensure their on the chain they like.  
  
The tricky part is the replay protection, which *looks* like we'll be able to solve before the event unfolds. But that's a whole different story.

We're actually developing a solution that will let you choose which chain to follow. In addition, we're considering tweaking the app to automatically follow the coin with the highest dollar value, as this will be a leading indicator of hash power in the future, and less likely to switch once the fork has occurred.

By that logic, we had about 30 bear and bull markets from 2013-2015. It's a bit like measuring the shoreline of England - it depends on your ruler.  
  
From April to June 2014 the price increased 80%. Was that a bull market? You could argue it, but I think most people would see it as a dead-cat bounce within the context of a larger secular bear market.  
  
I think at this point we're just arguing semantics. But just for fun I fabricated a bear market with high volatility just to show that (depending on the day) you can still come out ahead with DCA:

That was my situation until last week. Now, don't get me wrong, I know hundreds of bitcoiners, but all through the great blockchain grapevine. But I've never run into anybody *randomly* who owned about bitcoin until I was on a flight from Tokyo to the US, wearing my orange bitcoin shoes, and the guy next to me goes "oh, cool. Bitcoin." And I did one of those slow turns with wide eyes thinking to myself "we're going to be great friends." Turns out he owned BTC, LTC, and ETH and does a bit of trading too. I was so used to wearing bitcoin clothing *for years* without it ever being noticed that it was a pretty surreal experience.

Huh? We said no such thing. The only comment on labeling was made by "me" as an individual. My basic position is that we'd only call it bitcoin if the rest of the world called it bitcoin.  
  
If you think that will never happen, then you have your answer, we'll never call it bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:09:00
Hi there. You’ll be fine with Bread. Just don’t make any transactions during the fork (my guess is the period of uncertainty will be over in less than a week). PSA, the issue of replay attacks is not limited to SPV wallets. Nobody should be making transactions unless they know how to properly segregate their coins.

I'd argue the backbone is taking the stance we published, knowing that it would receive criticism like yours. The blog is pretty clear, and totally honest in our approach. I understand you'd like us to take *your* side, but telling our customers who disagree with you what they will do is against the spirit of bitcoin, in my humble opinion. I do respect your right to vocalize against our stance though - all part of the process.
@_date: 2015-09-30 16:56:15
The author uses a game theory framework to draw his conclusions, but he ignores the precipitous and obvious decline in bitcoin value if such an attack were to take place.  
  
I would estimate conservatively that a successful attack would reduce the price per bitcoin by at least 50%. If you factor in that assumption, the incentives are still highly in favor of cooperation vs. subversion. In a real way, the bitcoin holders would start voting with their wallets - dumping coins, and these important players should be included in the model as they step up to influence the miners.

With Bread you own the private keys, so you'll get coins on both chains.  
  
Two things to keep in mind:   
  
1) Bread will be releasing detailed information about the split, how we are going to handle it, and what customers should do. So stay tuned.  
  
2) During the time of the fork, it's best to not make any transactions on any wallet, due to the replay issue. If you can hang tight, your coins will be safely waiting for you after the fork turmoil resolves.
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:07:20

This part is my favorite. Let me take $10 a year from you, and I'd happily provide you with a safe investment known as "chalash bonds." They cost $100 and pay out $5 per year, backed by the full faith and credit of you!
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:41:15
The fee amount is related to your chances of getting found in the *next* block. Because the network is decentralized, finding blocks is kind of like a game of dice. They show up about every 10 minutes, but frequently take 1 minute, or 2 minutes, or 15 minutes. About once a week or two you get a block that takes 90 minutes. There have even been instances of multiple hours without a single block found. So even if you submit a high fee, you still rely on the cosmic dice of the universe to deliver blocks to the miners, and sometimes it just takes a while. Hope that helps!
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:28:52
Bread is good 
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:53:03
It’s actually really useful for one thing: reducing risk in volatile markets. So, you could say that DCA is for... anybody buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-08 12:41:32
Less mining doesn’t really affect supply.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:15:52
True! As long as there is sufficient volatility.

Don't you think that bitcoin will have the highest market price?
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:08:37
Just out of curiosity, what method of replay protection do you think would be appropriate for Bread? We're SPV so we have some limitations, but if there is a solid replay/split solution that you know of then we're all ears.  
  
Also, sad to see you think we're being political. We didn't sign the NYA and aren't pushing for it - but we have to deal with it as it looks like it's going to happen.

Many people have said this recently, but could you give a precise example of how a customer would lose funds in Bread?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:05:05
I will let you define it however you like, and if you permit me sufficient volatility within the bear market, you can still come out ahead with dollar cost averaging.  
  
Continuing the example, if the price then went from $450 to $100 for a year, and then up to $110, you would still be in the black, and I hardly would consider a 10% increase breaking out of the "bear market."
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:39:17
This is exactly backwards. And if 21 believes this, then they are in big trouble. Bitcoin itself is fantastic for transferring large sums of money. It alone allows me to send $10M worth of value instantly from Shanghai to Los Angeles, when the banks are closed, near instantly, to anybody, for free. 
  
Micro payments on the Bitcoin network are highly frictional. At the current 2 cents per transaction, a 2 cent micropayment will have an effective 50% fee. That kind of friction can only be relieved by off chain solutions. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:01:02
If you are on iOS in the US, check out Bread's buying fee. It's pretty much the cheapest out there.
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:10:52
But I can't really. Because if I wanted to send you 1/2 of 1 penny, it would have to tag along with a fee of 4x that value, if it ever wanted to be confirmed in a block. Right?
@_date: 2015-09-23 18:02:32
I guess I would have to see more about the architecture to understand this. If it's the case, then it sounds like devices will not actually be in possession of private keys with associated addresses that contain small amounts of bitcoin. Rather, 21 plans to keep the block rewards themselves, and then maintain an internal ledger of which devices are owed how much bitcoin from their efforts. If that's the case, then it means these devices would be transacting off chain relying on 21 to keep everything honest and running.  
  
Otherwise, I don't see how 21 can effectively bundle what amounts to dust transactions with a single transaction fee on the blockchain. If so, on what schedule, and in what bundles? Happy to hear from anybody who understands how they might achieve this technically.
@_date: 2015-09-23 15:04:25


  
Could you give an example? I've always been a bit confused about why that would be.
@_date: 2015-04-26 11:36:54
Some of your choices are custodial wallets and some are personal (or multisig, which is kind of a hybrid) wallets. To be fair, you should probably have two lists. Personally, I would never keep more than a few million bits in a custodial wallet, ever. 
@_date: 2019-09-08 20:19:51
Mining is just an incentive to secure the network. The number of miners or power of the mining equipment doesn’t affect the rate* at which new bitcoin is found. This is different than real world mining such as gold. 
*Technically, mining power changes can affect discovery rate for short periods of time, until the difficulty adjusts. But long term, the rate at which coins are found still works out to a ~10 minute average interval.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:36:39
How is Bread dictating rules to you by explicitly giving you the power to follow the original bitcoin chain, even if it has minority hashing power? That doesn't seem like dictating to me.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:33:41
What about the toppling central banks part?
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:11:31
Yes, with Bread you own the private keys so you’ll have coins in both chains. But it will take a little while for them to become “visible” in the app itself. Same with Electrum.

Cool. I'll pass on your info. A check balance feature should be pretty easy to make. As for the sweep vs. import function, importing is generally considered to be less safe. Plus, if you lose your phone, that imported address won't be part of the HD chain regenerated by your pass phrase, so it's a way to make it less likely for somebody to lose coins that way.   
  
Good feedback though.

Hi there. These are great questions! BRD has a protocol for which changes can be made and by whom for merges that go into the general release. I personally keep all my funds in the app.

GBTC is run by Grayscale, so they are the custodians of the actual bitcoin that you would be exposed to. They are very reputable and have great security, but nobody is immune to the modern day version of a bank robbery. If that were to happen, there may be some insurance in place, but it would be complicated. Chuck is the custodian of the GBTC shares, but that's not something that can be "stolen" like bitcoin.  
  
Likewise, Coinbase is also very reputable, but since they are holding your bitcoins, if those coins are stolen then again, there would be trouble. With coinbase you would own the coin itself, not shares.  
  
Hope that helps. Happy to answer any more questions!
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:40:46

In many ways, I think the run up itself is the trigger for the correction. It's a bit like gravity. Anything commodity that goes up 10x in 3 months is going to enter a bear market. There are simply too many people in the black for it to be sustainable. Plus, while we don't have a ton of data points, we have at least 4: summer '11, early '13, late '13, and late '17. Yes, there will always be some kind of precipitous for the bubble to pop. But like a balloon surrounded by needles, it doesn't really matter what it is. That's my humble opinion!
@_date: 2015-11-17 15:06:32
I think your framework is sound. Taken a step further, imagine that *everybody* is dumping their FRCs for bitcoin at the same time. The IMF would then need bitcoin to stabilize the falling values of the FRCs, and couldn't do it in any other way.  
  
Of course, in a full blown currency dump, the IMF would probably burn through most of their bitcoin anyway. But if they held, say 2M bitcoin, they could have a significant impact in dampening its price spike. And the slower they were to sell it, the more powerful their remaining bitcoins would be.

Indeed! There might be some incommensurability between the set of all natural numbers between 0 and 2^256 and their ECDSA counterparts on the elliptical curve and that makes it impossible to land on certain numbers (addresses) no matter which private key is chosen, even though the initial set is super gobs bigger.

For breadwallet, the backup is linked to your unique phone and you're going to need your recovery phrase. This is an important security feature because it means that an attacker getting access to your iTunes account (happens all the time) cannot compromise your coins.  
  
For question 2, as long as you have your recovery phrase, you can load your wallet onto a new phone and move your coins. In the meantime, they'll be safe because the thief would need your pin to access your coins, and there are limited attempts available before the wallet is wiped.

Blocks are there to order the transactions. In a decentralized system, everybody's experience varies regarding which transactions occur when. So you need to set an agreed sequence on a regular basis, to protect against double spending. 
  
Your solution would work as long as your central processor was good at lining up the transactions on a consistent basis.

There is also a large price difference. The NAV for GBTC is brittle and so it can trade at a significant premium, much more than any price you'll pay to buy bitcoin directly.  
  
Also, from a tax perspective, you won't owe anything unless you sell your coins. So in that case, just buy, hold, and feel smart if the price goes up.

While I think this is a good post, and lays out the reasons why this particular type of compromise is inferior to one of the proposals, there is a very real practical need to move ahead in scaling.  
  
The choice may very well be between a "political" compromise such as SegWit+2MB, and no SegWit at all, ever. And if that's the case, I think even a staunch non horse trader would have to admit that a non-ideal compromise that creates a path forward is better than stalemate.

breadwallet is rolling out buy bitcoin functionality right now. They allow you to link a bank account and then get the coins delivered straight to your phone, so you control them yourself. As long as you write down your 12-word recovery phrase and store it someplace safe then your coins will be secure and you're good to go.  
  
Full disclosure: I am an early investor in, and currently work at breadwallet - but only because it's good!

Pretty close. The buy price is always higher than the sell price because of how markets work, regardless of which exchange you look at. The exchanges don't list prices as much as they provide a market for people to place offers, both for buys and sells. Other traders come in and decide whether to take those offers, and now you have a live market, where the price moves dynamically depending on the last trade.  
 
You can still buy dollars for BTC on bitfinex, but the won't do you much good. I recommend you take some time inspecting the bottom chart on this site to understand how order books work:

It was just a turn of phrase and it’s hard to avoid misinterpretations. I think the piece you are missing is that the app needs to always scan any HD address chain that is has ever supported, and that scanning for our app is somewhat slow because the app connects directly to the bitcoin network, vs a server we control and monitor - this I think is an often overlooked privacy benefit over other wallets. You don’t have to trust us not to turn over your tx history to the government because we don’t have access to it in the first place.  
  
What I mean is that version 1 (��) of bitcoin uses the regular 1abc... format. So no matter what formats we support in the future, BRD will still need to scan those early addresses to see if they have funds in them. Otherwise, hodlers who try to find their coins in 5 years or whatever will be pissed. We could implement P2SH addresses pretty easily, but we’ve decided to take some heat in the short term to leapfrog to Bech32. That way, the app won’t get slowed down by checking P2SH addresses for eternity. It will only have to check 2 chains. This is the honest truth - I don’t really care what the conspiracy theories say. You’re getting this from the horse’s mouth and I don’t think there is a
better source than that.  
  
Also, if you don’t think we are serious about Bech32, try sending from BRD to a Bech32 address. It works! Why would we do this unless we plan to push the standard? Seems like a good way to lose customers if we don’t offer Bech32 receive in the app.

It's not null. It's just a poor apples/oranges comparison. A notional value of $1M does not mean the contract is worth $1M, but rather something like 5% as you rightly say. Counting the full notional value of total derivatives gives an inflated value additionally due to rehypothecation, i.e, I can relend a position and it gets counted twice in the aggregate.

Perhaps a closer look at your terms would be relevant.  
  
Anarchism refers to a lack of order. Capitalism refers to private ownership of the means of production. Socialism refers to a collective ownership of the means of production.  
  
In my opinion, anarcho-socialism doesn't make sense. To achieve any level of socialistic goals, you must have order, and order must be enforced (in this context).  
  
What you are mentioning are observations. Yes, there is a lot of wealth in the world. Yes, there is a lot of technology. Yes, if we took the discarded food from restaurants in Texas we could feed the hungry in Chad.  
  
The question that you are asking, or that you should have asked, is what is the role of force? When is it appropriate to force others to pay for your healthcare? When is it appropriate to force others to deliver their services to you?  
  
There may indeed be a circumstance in which these things are appropriate, but I have yet to hear of one.  
 
You mention the term opt-in. That makes no sense. Governing bodies are distinctly comprehensive.

Mining is going to be a no-go for individuals at this point. Only highly specialized and efficient mining "farms" are profitable now.

You're confusing leverage with contracted liability. In many cases, it doesn't exist, at least not to the extent that the notional value would have you believe - if it did then it would be reflected in M2. [The real value of the derivatives]( is much less, as is their aggregate risk. Net Current Credit Exposure (NCEE): ~$400B or Total Credit Exposure (TCE): $1.1T are more comparable to the other figures in the infographic.

I think that's a good argument. I'll add two more points if you wish to comment:  
  
1) Clearly a deflationary currency doesn't *always* go up in value. Even a fully saturated "bitcoin world" where it is the only currency would only have yearly value increases on your money when the economy grows. During a recession the value should go down as the ratio of currency units to goods+services goes up.  
  
2) Dovetailing off my first comment, I think it's evident that people will always spend money on life's essentials. Using a currency with stable supply would undoubtedly reduce profligacy, but not eliminate spending altogether.

So, I guess first we have to acknowledge that they are not really lines, they are step functions - meaning that if you were to zoom in, you would see a series of horizontal lines, which then jump up to the next address every once in a while. So there is some rate at which this new address comes along. I suppose that it could be due to the way change addresses work under the hood of most wallets, but on the other hand, it seems like it would be some kind of service or company, which is systematically creating new popular addresses at a certain rate...

OK, so what you are saying is that PubKey is ordered in terms of time. So time is the function. In this way, it makes sense that new addresses will send money to new addresses at a given rate. I suspect that all of the lines are indeed due to change addresses. But the questions remain as to why the slopes are what they are, seem to change abruptly sometimes, and show interesting symmetries.  
  
Cool stuff. I'm going to noodle on it a bit more.

Be careful with your insults. is right. Sustained transaction rates beyond 6MB per hour will result in an ever increasing average confirmation time. Without a block size increase, you may be told by your client one day that "this transaction is expected to be confirmed in 5 years."   
  
He's also right that transactions don't stay in the unconfirmed pool forever. Eventually, nodes refresh the pool due to a number of reasons, and your tx will never be embedded.

Why would fees become insignificant with zero risk of orphan blocks? Because the block size would be unlimited? Even with big blocks, you'll still need to pay a transaction fee to get prioritized. It might have less to do with costs incurred to miners and more to do with throttling spam, no?

Breadwallet uses the BIP39 protocol with a standard derivation for addresses. Using the algorithm, it can generate an infinite number of addresses. When you "load" your phrase into a new phone, breadwallet makes a few addresses and then starts checking the blockchain for past activity. If an address has a balance it's included in he total. It goes down the list of addresses until the past activity stops, and then is ready for use.

Hi u/braindamageldn.

@_date: 2017-07-17 14:16:24
Oh, boy. We know! Honestly the challenge is tuning the algorithm. The drop off on the confirmation curve from 6 blocks to ~infinity blocks is really steep. So if the market is moving up in tx fee, we need to make sure that people choosing an economy option don't get stuck in the mempool forever. We're working hard on this.  
  
As for actual custom fees it's unlikely we'll do that, because we focus on making bitcoin easy to use and hard to mess up. Users that are less savvy than you would be likely to enter something ridiculous thinking they'd be getting a deal, when in reality they are dooming themselves to watching paint dry forever.  
  
Thanks for the feedback, it really does help us prioritize.

Just to be clear, this model is highly flawed. It works for gold and global money supply, but not for E-commerce, black market, or remittances.  
  
The first two are discreet amounts, whereas the latter three are volume figures over the course of one year - which is an arbitrary timeframe.  
  
To make it more accurate, you should divide the volume figures by a factor of 10 (or something in that range, indicating that $60M can support $600M in transactions over the course of a year).

Using your analogy, imagine that you have deposited both chickens and gold at dmarEX. There are many customers there, some with chickens, some with gold, and some with both.  
  
If suddenly I stop allowing people to withdraw chickens, then everybody is going to convert their chickens into gold in order to get their money out. When this happens, the price of gold will go up (in chickens) because there will be very little demand for chickens.

You own the private keys with Mycelium so the situation is similar. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:50:48
It's not quite that simple, but the short answer is yes.  
  
Bread generates a random 12-word recovery phrase that is then used to derive a list of private keys and their associated addresses for general use. That's why once you write down your phrase, it's pretty much impossible to lose your coins in the even of phone loss, destruction, or theft.  
  
So the phrase is your private keys. And you own them. Now, if you wanted to access the *raw* private keys, that is also possible using some software that is widely available, but not advisable unless you know what you're doing.

You could head on over to r/bitcoinmining. They should be able to set you up.  
  
My instinct tells me that if you want to turn $500 into bitcoin via mining, that you're going to end up with about $75 worth of bitcoin, and a useless machine that you can't sell for $10 after a year.  
  
So if you want the bitcoin, just buy it. If you want to mine for a hobby, then go for it - just expect to lose money.

Eventually they will, once a txn has been broadcast it will stay in a node's memory until that node is reset.

@_date: 2017-07-25 13:19:47
That's correct. The addresses are generated in the same order every time from your seed. So if I were to ask you to look at the 547th receive address generated from a given 12-word recovery phrase, it would be very easy to do so. The app starts with address  checks if it has past activity, and then creates address  checks if it has past activity, and then creates address  As soon as it runs across a few addresses that have never been used, it stops the process.

It's a pleasant video. What it claims is kiiiiiind of how banking works, but not really.  
  
The author tries to describe the bank simplistically as a financial intermediary that creates positive carry by borrowing money from one person, and then lending it out at a greater rate.  
  
In reality, retail banking acts more like a balloon, where the bank doesn't need deposits to make a loan, just *some* deposits. In the video, this should have been portrayed as something like 10x of the money going to the borrowers than the amount the savers originally deposited.  
  
Furthermore, in the real world, the borrowers immediately put their money in the bank, or spend it with somebody else who will, which creates fresh deposits, and new lending power.  
  
I understand that the authors had a different focus than how banking works, but I think they missed the mark on the relationship between capital and credit.

It depends on what the timeframe is. If the timeframe is 2 hours, and bitcoin stays at $200 for the first 119 minutes, and then shoots up to $300 for the last 1 minute, then it would follow that all exchanges would have prices about $100 greater than the index - at that moment.

Unfortunately, without the device password enabled, then the recovery phrase could be accessed...
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:18:51
Very cool. I do admire the work you've put into this. As a simpleton I've always opted to just buy bitcoin, but miners who know what they are doing can certainly come out ahead.

The article wasn't actually that bad. But I think that the author is focusing on trusting algorithms as a flaw the same way that people talked about firewalls being a deal breaker for the internet in the 90's. It really is a non-issue.  
  
His mistake is understandable when he illustrates how few developers that there are. What he ignores is the power of consensus, that any funny business whatsoever by core devs is responded to and corrected swiftly. The devs have *influence* but no real *power*.
@_date: 2016-07-26 15:12:03
I would argue that SPV provides an acceptable balance of security and convenience. Any ongoing fork or Sybil attack would be widely known and defeated quickly.  
  
I do enjoy theoretical examples, and I think that's what pb1x is discussing. Also, I greatly respect him and any flippant tone that you perceived was unintentional.  
  
However, in practice, an attack that could successfully deceive SPV devices is very difficult to perform, and would not be enduring. I'm happy to hear about how one could one could be actually executed to great effect, but to date I hear mostly hypotheticals.

To be fair, the function for buying bitcoin is meant as a convenient way for customers to acquire coins at a price that they deem attractive, and the coins will be delivered at the agreed rate. If you plan to trade coins I would have to recommend that you use an exchange. Again, I have no excuse for the delay in your coins arriving, and I agree that we should be judged by the quality of our service, but it should be clear that we aren't offering a service that is meant to facilitate trading.

Oh, boy. We're really sorry about this. I know that the delay is frustrating. Part of the challenge is that breadwallet is decentralized, so we have to use partners to fulfill traditional services such as buy/sell bitcoin.

I really can't do much but apologize for the time being and ask that you give us some time to iron out the integrations.

Granted (so perhaps you should say third parties, since we are talking about multiple nodes). So what is an attack that a malicious party can conduct that would result in mistakenly assuming funds had been sent, from which a full node would not suffer?
@_date: 2016-07-28 17:08:10

@_date: 2016-07-26 15:28:30
OK, thanks.  
  
If somebody wanted to fool me into thinking they sent 10 BTC to my SPV wallet, they would still need to create a valid transaction, or at least use a UTXO that was part of the network state very recently (let me know if this assumption is correct. I'm basically saying that if there a swarm of malicious nodes isn't able to hold out for very long). If they tried to do so by initiating a widespread Sybil attack, wouldn't they be risking that their transaction would be gathered by the mempools of honest nodes and confirmed in actual blocks?  
  
What I'm getting at is: Let's forget about a double spend, because full nodes are susceptible to that too. Let's forget about refusing to relay transactions which is mainly a nuisance. What would somebody actually have to do to make a synthetic transaction that would show up in an SPV wallet, without risking that they would actually lose the money?

Curious why there is so much shade being thrown at BIP75. It's just like an email address: you control it but it doesn't necessarily identify you. And you can have more than one. The whole point is to provide MORE privacy to the user who doesn't have to reuse or advertise specific receive addresses. 
  
I know Peter Todd carries weight around here but I'm surprised that so many people just follow his opinions blindly. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 13:13:42


  
You probably shouldn't dismiss those who disagree with you as "whiny" in that case. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 11:54:31
Hi pb1x. I think you might be a little confused about how breadwallet works. What third party are you referring to that you have to trust regarding your receive balance?
@_date: 2016-07-15 18:27:52
Boat get excited.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:59:43
We'll be ready and fully compatible. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 04:28:46
I think once people realized that the BIP is akin to an email address, with about the same level of personal indentification (I.e. Not much and/or user defined), that state imposed KYC via this method would be like the TSA accepting your Reddit handle in lieu of your passport. Or *A* Reddit handle I should say since there is no inherent limit to how many you can create and control (or abandon).
  
It is likely that BIP75 actually improves user privacy since a username can be a source of multiple receive addresses that do not have to be advertised or shared via unencrypted channels. The whole point is to provide the backbone for privacy conscious address books. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:39:23
Yeah, you actually have a good point. But still, no way bitcoin is a government ploy. They would have built in KYC from the get-go if that were the case.

Even if it does, just avoid making transactions (on any wallet, not just bread), until the dust settles. Your coins are fine in bread because you control the private keys, just like with a paper wallet.

Then 1 BTC is 1.000,000.00. Five thousand bits is 0.005,000.00 and so on. I'm actually pretty used to it now, although I can't imagine it would ever be mainstream.

Pb1x is confused. You can trust breadwallet. Breadwallet is an SPV wallet that connects directly to the Bitcoin network. All transactions are broadcast and validated among multiple peers. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 15:07:42
So at what point can you be relatively sure that you have funds in an address, controlled by a private key on your device? I'm confused about your comments that would be uncertain of whether you received funds, but that you should be quite sure you can send them.

Holding your own coins is essential. I use breadwallet.

Yes. As long as you have your 12-word recovery phrase written down somewhere safe, you're all set. Again, best to avoid making transactions during a split because things could be weird on the network for a little while.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:38:42
Yes, latency would be very important with larger blocks, but it's already important today. Centralizing effects such as access to mining hardware, access to cheap electricity, and access to fast internet speeds are unfortunate realities, but luckily none are easily monopolized (mining equipment, maybe more than the others, but only for periods of time).  
  
Does Korea have faster internet speeds than Kansas? Absolutely. Just because you can't mine in Kansas have we encountered excessive centralization? I would argue no.  
  
ps. I like your calculation on marginal orphan cost. Very cool.

It depends on how you define those patterns. It's actually really hard to do, but I'd be interested in what you think.  
  
In terms of where the charts end up, that's going to be a normal distribution with the mean being the starting point. So in that respect, yes, a chart starting at 50 is less likely to end up above 70 than 60. I think that might be what you're getting at, yes?
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:10:05

@_date: 2013-05-13 15:56:30
That's a good question. I suppose there are two things in play, the actual demand for Bitcoin, and the ease of purchase. Liquidity within Mt. Gox is fabulous. You can buy and sell Bitcoins with ease, but only if you have jumped through all of the hoops the get past the gates in the first place.  
  
The difficulty seems to be getting the fiat currency into the market, and arguably during the last bubble, if it had been easier to get fiat in quickly, then the price would have seen a more sizable increase.  
  
Perhaps liquidity wasn't the incorrect term. Something more akin to "number and difficulty of hoops to jump through to play the game" would have been more appropriate. I'm open to suggestions for how to articulate this.
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:14:43
As somebody who frequently watches Peter Schiff's videos, I was very disappointed to see him make the simple math error of equating divisibility with unlimited supply (hint: gold is essentially infinitely divisible, too).

@_date: 2017-06-14 13:33:54
Yes, you are correct. But that is because blocks are limited to 1MB at the moment. Previously, miners did employ soft caps on block size before eventually working up to 1MB. With a larger block size, soft caps would be used again to optimize fee collection vs. orphan risk.
@_date: 2016-07-26 15:13:55
But if you were deceived in the first place, then you could be sending money you don't actually have, yes?  
  
(btw, I'm not trying to be difficult. This is a face-value honest discussion).
@_date: 2017-06-14 02:46:39
Good points but remember that there is a natural incentive to keep blocks small represented by orphan risk. If you try to propagate a 100MB block, you're taking a big chance that somebody won't swoop you with a 10MB block in the next 2 minutes. Considering the time distribution of blocks, it isn't worth it.

@_date: 2013-11-29 22:47:51
Yeah, no worries. What you should realize is that a lot of the 'short' replies are from people who have been involved for a long time (i.e. 2+ years), and as such they have had pretty much every possible discussion regarding Bitcoin at least 10 times each. So a lot of it is just expended patience, rather than outright hostility.  
  
What I think you are getting at is that the supply of Bitcoin is essentially fixed (yes, over the next 100+ years there will some minor inflation but for all intents and purposes, the final amount of 21M is probably already baked in to people's expectations, and thus the price). This is true, and rather than a glitch, it's a feature, possibly the most important feature of all.  
  
Behind the Bitcoin experiment is a statement, and that statement is that sound currencies are superior to debt-based fiat currencies. We've all grown up in a time where we're been taught that the money supply should grow to spur/accomodate economic demand and growth - but there is another school of thought, in fact many, that believe money supply growth is an insidious, subversive, and unethical process, and that the current global monetary system is rotten at the core.  
  
It's not such a crazy idea. Despite what you may have read about the "problems" with the gold standard, gold took us through a few thousand years with a pretty good track record. Where there were monetary crises, it was usually because some person or other had issued fiat currency and become irresponsible with its issuance.  
  
To answer you concern more directly, yes, if people get manic about purchasing Bitcoin because they think it will always go up, then we will see another bubble (like the one we are in now). What is important, is that this is not Bitcoin's first bubble, it is its 3rd or 4th. What is important is what happens after the next major correction - at which point you should take the time to look at the Bitcoin community when the rest of the world isn't - to observe a group of slightly nerdy idealists working hard to change the world for the better.

Typically, if you are using a personal client such as BitcoinQT, electrum, multi-bit, or blockchain.info, the transaction fee is deducted from your wallet, and not the amount you are sending. Hope that helps.  
  
As for including enough to transfer the money from the card... well it depends on how much you plan on including as a transaction fee. Could technically be zero...
@_date: 2013-10-07 13:57:40
bubble is right. You could just purchase ~65 Bitcoin for $8k and just hang on to them, with 100% chance that you'll have 65 Bitcoin in a year's time.  
  
Or, you could gamble with $8k for a chance at having ~80 Bitcoin in a year, but a more likely chance of gathering only 30, 40, or 50.

It was interesting to hear the part about "the community sharing the risk." It sounds like a really basic version of the sentiment that provides fertile ground for central banking.

@_date: 2013-11-04 17:54:08
One thing that I don't quite understand is how delaying the transmission of a block can be more rewarding. For instance, if this "selfish pool" had 25% of the hashing power, then they would gather roughly 25% of the newly generated Bitcoin. This simple fact doesn't change, even when the selfish pool can put together a chain of 2 or 3 blocks before the rest of the network. This is going to happen from time to time anyway. Even though "honest" miners might be disappointed that their blocks get orphaned from time to time, it doesn't mean that they will fare any better by joining the selfish pool. Blocks get orphaned on a regular basis anyway. What I'm getting at is that there is no way to turn 25% hashing power into more than 25% Bitcoin win-probability - meaning that the rest of the miners still gain an average of 75% of the new coins…  
  
Interested in hearing more thoughts on this.

No, you're right. The total valuation is likely "inflated" in this way. The point that others are making, I believe, is that those lost coins can't contribute to price decreases because they can't be sold, which is also true. It kind of balances out.

Thank you for your thorough rebuttal. I am pleased to see that you have come up with many legal activities that, when combined, provide examples of behavior that is... well, not a good idea.  
  
However, as far as I know, it is not illegal to be naked near children, nor to have a matchstick near a fireworks factory, nor to teach kindergarten while watching porn, locking the doors in a theater is probably your best point.  
  
What you are expressing is common sense, or perhaps employment policy (since obviously the kindergarten teacher would be fired). Please don't misunderstand my commentary as conflating things which are fine with things which shouldn't be illegal. I'm sure we disagree on the lists, but we probably have more in common than you expect.

While I'll give you credit for attempting to lay out how this could be done, I think you'll find very little support for this idea.  
  
Something that you may want to consider is the following: because so many have embraced Bitcoin and its predictable diminishing inflation rate, and very few have embraced alt coins which provide embedded demurrage, one might be left with the uncomfortable conclusion that the only reason a rational human would use such an unpredictable currency, would be due to the direct use, or implied threat, of unethical force.

Thanks, I read the Data and Method page that you linked, but I still don't understand how the author gets $2,200 per Bitcoin from a $266B evaluation. For instance: $266B / 12M (estimate for extant BTC), = ~$22,000 right?  
  
Edit: And by the author, I suppose I mean you :-)

Sorry, stopped reading there. Reminded me of this one kid in my freshman-year philosophy class.  
  
EDIT: Realized that the author is the poster and is genuinely/respectfully seeking feedback. OP, perhaps this will change your mind about the "Ponzi scheme" label, at least from a technical perspective:  
  
Claim: Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme  
  
Rebuttal:  
• Ponzi schemes are fraudulent investment programs where old investors are paid off by new investor money. They are fundamentally unsustainable because eventually there are not enough new investors  
• BTC is not an investment program, it is a currency. There are no promises around returns, and no party to make those promises because there is no central BTC company or authority  
• Increases in BTC value are sustainable even once the last adopter joins the group because of its usefulness, i.e. it does not rely on new investors or adopters to support the value as the value is determined by its usefulness as a store of value and a means of exchange  
 
• There are risks associated with holding BTC, but they are not the same risks assumed by those participating in a Ponzi scheme
@_date: 2013-06-15 04:31:26
Perhaps the answer comes down to the assets available for sale. For instance, take Ripple, which if I am not mistaken, has XRPs worth more than the entire Bitcoin supply. But, only a limited amount of XRPs are on the market, meaning that yes, the "market cap" or valuation is very high, but the practical application is more tenuous.  
  
The same goes for USD, and I agree now that you mention it that M2 is probably a better metric. Valuation is also a function of velocity, and the velocity of USD is such that X $trillion can masquerade as much more.  
  
Thoughts?

Yes your words in particular tipped the scale.

Again, apologies if its appeared that we were ignoring your recommendation.

It all has to do with digital signatures. A digital signature is a way of proving that you possess that private key to an address without revealing the private key itself. When you perform a transaction, the network looks at the address from which you are trying to send the coins, and then checks your signature to verify that you own the private key.  
  
A digital signature can be created offline, and then be broadcasted using a hot wallet.
  
I hope that helps. It's a pretty complicated topic so I would encourage you to look it up if you want a more in depth understanding.

I think that's an ongoing debate. Just because something is paid for by taxes doesn't mean that it's the only way, or the best way, to pay for it. There are food stamps, but most people just buy food outright. Would people starve if food stamps went away? My personal opinion is no.  
  
I'm actually biased in favor of considering taxpayer funded education and healthcare a disservice, with the results being lower quality and higher costs. Free markets tend to do the opposite over time: raise quality and lower costs. In 1960, healthcare was cheap, and insurance for catastrophic events like car crashes or cancer only cost $2/month (about $20 USD today). So what happened? Why is it so hard to access healthcare today?
  
But as I said, it's an ongoing debate. I can understand why you would be concerned about removing taxpayer-funded government programs, but I don't fall on that side of the fence.

Oh, man, what a doozy. My favorite quote from that thread is this one:  
  
"This is a big gamble - you are exchanging the world's oldest and most recognised monetary asset for some digital pretend money, for the possibility of short term profit.
What is more, you are also giving up the possibility of making substantial profit on your gold - an asset which I believe is undervalued and has a huge amount of potential.
My feeling is that if Bitcoin does take off (again) it will be pretty volatile, because most of its users, like you, are speculators. So don't get greedy - after it peaks it will fall like a stone (again), so you need to get out before any mania stage.
Also, don't forget to measure any profit you make against gold (@ 225 BTC per toz or whatever rate you get), rather than dollars.
Anyway, good luck if you do this. Fortune favours the brave."

I think he means keeping coins on places like Coinbase or Mt. Gox or Havelock Investments, right? In that case, you do have to trust that the owner of the site is keeping your coins on hand and not lending them out or (worse) selling them to other people.

Great reply. I would claim, however, that there is one feedback vector from mining which is that almost 100% of new coins are sold for fiat. So this implies that an inflation rate of 5% or so not only affects price with monetary base dilution (small effect), but also with steady selling pressure, which can manifest as a large proportion of coins in the order book. Even so, this feedback is ultimately a function of price in the first place. Plus, in the future energy companies may accept bitcoin without converting it to fiat, in which case the loop would be closed - basically I agree with you. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:39:27

The lines on bitcoinity. You can never predict what is going to happen, at least not very well. But to give you an example of his it works, imagine that you buy $10,000,000 worth of Bitcoins. That would devour all of the ask orders up to about $250. Now, if you turn around and try to sell any of those coins, there won't be anybody behind you. You'll see a huge gap between $160 and $250. If you sell a coin immediately, it will have to be at $160. Then if you buy a coin right afterwards, it will have to be at $250. So you could sit there for a good amount of time just volleying the price back and forth because the order book is so thin. Over time, people creep back in on both sides, converging on a new spot price.

As somebody who has been in a similar position when I was younger, I would recommend that you approach your mother like an adult.  
  
1) Explain to her that you are very interested in Bitcoins and that you would like to buy 2.  
  
2) Tell her that you have done your research, understand that Bitcoins are very risky, and that you may lose all of your money.  
  
3) Emphasize that through reading about Bitcoin, that you have expanded your financial knowledge (i.e. where dollars come from, how markets work etc.) and that you are passionate about it.  
  
Then, if she helps you, you're golden. If she doesn't, you can always buy some using localbitcoins.com and meet at a public place. But since you aren't fully filled out physically, you should bring at least one adult friend with you for safety sake.

Transfer fees are actually voluntary, but in the future it is more than likely that there will be a "standard" fee if you want your transaction to be included in a block in a reasonable time frame.  
  
The good news is that even though it's hard to estimate that future fee, that it will still be relatively small. If you wanted to make a gesture that "here, this is a full Bitcoin, plus a little extra to transfer it to another address," you would be providing ample cushion with 1.05 Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-06 19:27:57
One thing you may want to consider is that $500 is the absolute minimum theoretical price that could result from $1b chasing 2m coins. It assumes that all the sellers are willing to part with their coins at $500. But that's not how markets work. Even today, just buying $20m worth of coins would push the price up over $1,000.   
  
So I disagree with that part of your logic. But you probably like my version better anyway :)

You would need significant financial resources because of the way markets work.

To properly peg Bitcoin, which is what I believe you are proposing, would require an incredible amount of resources, and would incur great losses.

I think that the difficulty in finding/mining/purchasing something of value is precisely due to its scarcity, and not really anything else. You could find a diamond on the ground by accident, and it would still be valuable since it's scarce.  
  
Maybe with Bitcoin it's confusing though because usually difficulty to obtain FOLLOWS natural scarcity. But in this case, scarcity is ESTABLISHED through artificial difficulty to obtain.  
  
I think we're on to something here, actually.

Yes, you do. The point is that you don't need $1T worth of currency to support $1T worth of economic activity. The actual amount of money can be much less.  
  
For a Bitcoin analogy, you can have 21 Million Bitcoins in an economy that has a GDP of 210 Million Bitcoins. This is relevant when calculating what the price of a Bitcoin might be in the future - remembering that annual economic activity is measured in a cumulative time-dependend way, whereas market price is an instantaneous figure.

Welcome! Good luck trying to reintegrate into the real world
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:10:32
This was my response yesterday. Sorry, too lazy to paraphrase:  
  
"I suspect that economic inequality is something of a natural phenomenon. And in this particular case, the traunches are just proxies for adoption timing. If Bitcoin goes big, in 5 years, the headline will read, 1,000,000 people own half of the Bitcoins, since the user base will be maybe 10 times that - and it will include all members of the current "pie."  
What I would be more concerned with is absolute poverty, rather than relative wealth. How do the poorest fare? In the case of Bitcoin, somebody with $10,000 might not be in the upper echelons of holders, but could have still benefitted from a 10x value increase, having only speculated with $1,000 to begin with. $10,000 is a lot of money to a lot of people, and in many ways I think that should be the real point of the article: "Bitcoin lifts 1,000,000 out of poverty" might be a bit of a hyperbole, but it's still more apt in my view than panning the differences between people's positions."
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:12:32
Also where do the new coins go? Are they distributed evenly? Given as a proportion to current holdings? Remember that increasing the money supply isn't an even process. Somebody gets that money first and benefits.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:18:53
I agree that it's volatile, but I would argue that Bitcoin is much more akin to a legitimate startup than a penny stock. It's just that it has been available to the public since day 1. Lots of companies IPO in the 10's of billions, without ever having been traded before.  
  
Also, how much of anything is liquid? Facebook is worth over $100 Billion. I doubt you could get more than $3B out of it on a given day, without causing a massive price decrease. But this doesn't seem to cause much concern.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:41:55

One thing to consider is that the US has already experimented with a (almost) fixed currency supply in the 19th century and did very well with it.  
  
Declining profits in nominal terms wouldn't be an issue if purchasing power increased at a faster rate.  
  
And keep in mind that most of those savings will be put to work as capital for businesses.  
  
Just some food for thought.

Sure. While Bitcoin provides an incredibly easy way to move money around the world near instantaneously, if you want to exchange it for fiat (USD, JPY, EUR, etc) then you still have to go through legacy banking systems, which are slow, expensive, limiting, and sometimes unpredictable.  
  
By the time you got your money out of one exchange and into another, you would lose so much in fees or time that you wouldn't be able to take advantage of the different prices. Hope that helps.

You may want to re-visit your arguments.  
  
1) Both paper wallets and encrypted backups can be redundant.  
 
2) The more you back up ANYTHING, the easier it is to steal.  
 
3) Encryption is not necessarily any easier than paper wallets to "use"  
 
I think the point that you mean to make is: If you use paper wallets, don't lose them, and don't make them easy to steal.  
  
These are the same to issues that need balancing with encrypted wallets.

I'm going to take your word for it, and assume that all of this is true.  
  
And if it is, it reminds me of the time I got a "D" on an assignment because I wrote a paper about Leonardo DaVinci in mirror writing (i.e., you have to hold it up to a mirror to read it), something that he was know to do himself. The paper was actually pretty good and met all the criteria (i.e. word count).

To peg Bitcoin, you would need a large financial player to indicate their willingness to buy or sell Bitcoins at a given price. This is how the USD was pegged to gold and how foreign banks peg their currencies to the USD. Who do you think would be willing to take on such a huge role?

Oh, boy is it bedtime! I'm East Coast time, are you? I agree with you that currencies and stocks are different. But please remember that Facebook is trading at above 200x earnings, meaning that the actual value per unit of stock is exceedingly low, and that the price is based on future expectations. Buying Facebook today is similar to saying that you'll put $2 in today, only to earn $0.01 per year.  
  
Maybe it was understated in my article, but I do believe that widespread adoption is essential to Bitcoin's success. I just believe that people are putting the cart before the horse by spending it for the sake of spending it. As Bitcoin rises in value, demand will increase for it, and this in itself can be the primary driver of adoption.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:03:00
oooooo, you're in trouble. You said the Q word.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:25:39
In theory, it can be used a store of value, even if it cannot be used for normal transactions for goods and services.  
  
For example, the gold market is valued at about $8 Trillion today. Very few people actually own gold, and you certainly can't buy groceries with it.

Oh, wow. Iceland is such an interesting place when it comes to money, speculation, and derivatives.

That's a valid point. I guess I never got around to saying it explicitly. The conclusion should be that if bitcoin works without regulation, that it will invalidate many claims that "regulation is for your own protection," leaving the alternative explanation that it is a blunt anti competitive tool.

It's a tricky problem. But the answer is that the ratio of males:females will remain at 50:50.  
  
You are correct in going generation by generation to see what happens, so let's take it further.  
  
Generation 1: 100 babies born. 50 girls, 50 boys.  Total boys:girls=50:50
  
Generation 2 (only those with girls maybe continue): 50 babies born. 25 boys, 25 girls. Total boys:girls=75:75.  
  
Generation 3: (only those with girls may continue = 25 babies born. 12.5 boys, 12.5 girls. Total boys:girls=87.5:87.5  
  
Now, please excuse the morbid child splitting. But I believe you will find that no matter when you tell people to stop having children, that there will always be 50% boys and 50% girls. Thanks for entertaining the riddle.
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:53:14
He's a true forecaster. But it's also possible that he could become the greatest forecaster. In fact, if that happens, he might also become something other than a forecaster - that is of course, unless he stops forecasting now, which is a possibility.  
  
So let me be clear, he is may be a good forecaster.

Pretty sure their original cost was ~$1M. So compared to ~$60M or so, it may not have been a drop in the bucket… more of a thimbleful.

I thought about making an argument that IPOs are an example of such spikes. That a company such as Instagram can go from $0 to $1B in a couple years may be evidence to this effect. The difficulty is in finding such examples in currently traded market places. But I concede your point that such a move would be highly unusual from a historical standpoint.
  
Edit: The Instagram example was obviously not an IPO, but rather a private purchase. The analogy is the same, though.

I'm also long gold, but I think that Rothbard was correct in his subjective theory of value. Frankly, I'm not sure what Peter Schiff's point is about intrinsic value. Is he claiming that because people like gold for jewelry that it will never be worth zero? That's probably true, but so what? If gold's monetary component is 95%, and somehow this goes away, I'm going to be pretty peeved despite whether my gold is worth 0% or 5% of it's previous value.  
  
Just because you can put a floor under the price of something because it is useful in other ways doesn't really say much about whether it can be a successful currency or store of value.

The criminality of the first case may be sound, depending on the intent. If you were buying cigars from them, you are probably innocent. If you instructed them to kill innocent civilians, then you are guilty, I would expect.   
  
As far as the divorce example, again, the crime is not hiding the money. If you have been discovered hiding money that rightfully belongs to your spouse then you should have to pay it to them. But not for the act of hiding it, rather, for the act of having what belongs to her.

I probably would. But going back to the article, I'm a practical man, and I would be willing to compromise on the taxation issue, particularly if we could have more control over how our tax dollars are spent and more accountability for those who spend it.

Too bad. He hit all the points, even admitting that Bitcoin has everything that gold does and more, but he can't seem to get through the "intrinsic value" voodoo.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:37:16
Oh, certainly. It's just the supply that is stable-ish, but of course demand is not, and it's going to be a bumpy ride to wherever Bitcoin is going to end up. Long term though, with a large enough user base, as it becomes more trusted and has more time to undergo price discovery, the consensus is that the volatility should drop dramatically.  
  
Of course, until then, it'll suffer some issues with being a crappy currency due to price swings, at the same time being an incredible speculative vehicle.

So I follow your logic, and I agree that the amount of money spent on mining would be the same in both scenarios.

I don't see what is to keep me from taking 1 100millionth of an ounce of gold and putting it into a pouch… maybe melting it into an alloy with some other metal, and then carrying it around.  
  
If "carrying it around" is the metric of usefulness, then we encounter the same problem with gold in the other extreme, since I can't realistically carry much more than about 50 pounds of the stuff, about ~$1M worth.

The potential rise of alt-coins that would siphon away value from Bitcoin was my major concern when I first got involved. But over time, I've been convinced that the first-mover advantage of Bitcoin is so strong, and so many people are incentivized to push it forward, that Bitcoin will remain the dominant crypto currency for the foreseeable future. Because the code can evolve, any serious threat due to a positive feature in an alt-coin could be implemented relatively quickly.  
  
The 7 transactions per second is an artificially throttled amount, done to make sure that the system grows in a healthy way. There are various tradeoffs to raising this limit, including block chain size, and miner incentives, but the technical solutions - while not implemented yet - are well known and will be incorporated when the time is right. In addition, many Bitcon transactions in the future will take place off-blockchain (for instance, a Bitcoin bank can move money between accounts with their own internal ledger, and will only need to use the blockchain for deposits or withdrawals.  
  
So in summary, great points! Hopefully I've allayed some of your fears that these issues will cause problems down the line.

Good point.  
  
1) Don't know  
2) Imagery + the words   
"Real Virtual Currency  
a factual Bitcoin blog"  
3) - No charts (price is interesting, and I write about it, but it's not the most important thing. This isn't a trading site)
- No Casascius coin images (they are awesome, but they are everywhere)
- Because the whole protocol relies on math, I'm very much in favor of math-related imagery. For instance, things like spirals, golden rectangles, fractals, prime numbers, merkle trees, or elliptical curves.
- Because the theme of our site is merging the "real" with the "virtual," I'm interested in ways to blend the two. For instance, many "mathy" things can be found in nature. A spiral can be found in conch shells or galaxies. Sunflower seeds are arranged in Fibonacci series. Tree branches and blood vessels are fractals.
- Traditional notions of money are cool too. For instance, wampum, or sea salt.
- Dynamism is cool. Showing movement or flow. Networks and exchange.  
4) It would occupy a defined rectangle. To blend.... well, this kind of thing is way over my head. Somebody else is helping with the webpage.  
5) Hadn't considered this. Um, soon.  
  
In retrospect, I think I asked for something that was more involved than I had previously understood. So I'm basically backing off, but still answered the gentleman's questions since you were kind enough to point out that I hadn't.
@_date: 2013-04-20 00:34:11
Noble cause, but you would run into problems trying to reassign the currency value. If you use an algorithm to match supply of new coins with an approximate rate of dollar increase, then this would have to be changed. Besides, if you make the valuation model too complicated, people will end up using coins with simpler structures. Even the US government failed to keep the currency pegged to gold and printed too many dollars, eventually having to face the fact that Gold was undervalued at $20 and $35, because foreigners were importing it by the ton. I suspect similarly, that efforts to peg a digital currency to anything would result in failure.

He double-debunked himself.
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:35:50
I do agree that Bitcoin has the potential to reach much higher valuations, but I'd like to point out one flaw with the argument:  conflating volume with market cap (not the best term for a currency, but it is tossed around here commonly).  
  
For instance, if eCommerce is indeed responsible for $1T worth of transactions per year, it tells us nothing about the monetary base. The same dollar can easily be used 10 times per year, and under this scenario, $100B would be sufficient to turn over $1T in a year. The monetary base of $100B is much more akin to the "market cap" that is being referenced.  
  
So in short, yes, Bitcoin can go much higher, but annual turnover != market cap.

If hospitals have to raise their prices to cover their charity, then it wouldn't make them any different than any company with a corporate responsibility policy. Higher costs are not strictly speaking, taxes. And no, it doesn't bother me if a hospital charges me slightly more to cover the poor. But I can't say the same regarding taxing me and sending the money through a bureaucracy before it goes to its intended purpose. If the extra costs are managed by the hospital, then I expect the care delivery would be much more efficient dollar for dollar. 
  
With regards to public defense, personally, I couldn't care less if there were no police, nor a national armed force. I'm already more than 10 times as likely to be killed by a police officer than a terrorist. Maybe it would be a better world without them. That said, if you WANT the public defense, then there may not be a way to accomplish it other than through taxation. Does that clarify my point a bit?

On the contrary, I don't think that the dollar would have to fail.  
  
To answer you points in turn (and they are good points):  
  
1) People do still have a lot of faith in the USD, but the low interest rates are almost certainly a direct result of monetary easing. Absent this, interest rates would probably be much higher.  
  
2) I agree, it's not a good currency yet. But all of the trends for price, adoption, and development are extremely positive.  
  
3) I would agree with this, but why are there speculators? Speculators don't just trade with the assumption that something will go up for no reason. Rather, many are speculating on widespread adoption and usefulness of Bitcoin  
  
My main thesis is that if something so bizarre as Bitcoin can be experiencing such growth, that those who do feel the USD is in great shape may want to take a closer look - and draw their own conclusions.

While you are using the term infinity, it helps to realize that there are mathematical tools for dealing with your scenarios. For instance, you would never divide an ounce of gold into infinite pieces, you would only divide it into an arbitrarily large number of pieces, and then see what happens.   
  
For instance, if we split 1oz. of gold into 1,000 pieces, do we have more than 1oz. of gold? No. What is each piece worth? 1/1000th of 1oz. of gold. How much gold do we have if we melt the pieces together again? 1.oz of gold.  
  
Does this hold for splitting the 1oz. into 10,000 pieces? Yes. 100,000? Yes. 1,000,000? Yes.  
  
This is a colloquial version of what is known as a proof by induction, and it holds for any amount of divisibility, including "infinity."

My sense is that rehypothecating deposits can boost economic activity in the short term, but at the cost of creating instability in the credit market long-term.  
  
Fractional reserve banking isn't in itself a problem as long as market forces are permitted to signal when reserves should be shored up or lent out. I think the issues begin when a 3rd party guarantee creates moral hazard (i.e. risky bets will get bailed out), which is the situation that we're in now.  
  
A more natural product than FDIC insured demand deposits is the CD, in which a depositor lends $X to the bank for a given period of time before it can be withdrawn with interest. Demand deposits give the impression of money being "available" for withdrawal, when it fact it isn't - only a percentage of the total is needed to serve customers who wish to take out money at any given time. CDs are a more honest way of dealing with double, triple, or quadruple counting the same chunk of money as it moves from bank account to bank account.

It is, and it's a bit complicated, but if you look up "rehypothecation" you'll find some useful information.  
  
For example, if Chalash LLC was lending its customers' BTC to other individuals, those individuals might want to leave some of that BTC online at Riplin Inc. If Riplin is also lending out BTC, then those BTC can come right back and be deposited at Chalash again. What ends up happening is that more and more BTC "appear" to be on the books at these companies, but in reality they are just obligations on previous BTC. The promises to pay can get pretty tangled up and result in highly unstable financial systems.

Yes, the 12 word phrase is used to derive a never-ending chain of addresses with their associated private keys. Think of it as a master key to your wallet. The algorithm used to turn your phrase into keys is called BIP39, and is an established standard, meaning that if breadwallet ever just disappeared (highly unlikely, but let's imagine), you would still be able to use BIP39 to load your keys into a new wallet, or extract them manually (not recommend, but possible and not that hard).  
  
Hope that helps. There are no silly questions in cryptoland!

Also, even though somebody may have an ounce of gold, if they try and sell it, they will end up implicitly paying a brokerage fee, since gold buyers make their money on the buy/ask spread. It's similar in that way.

He's not terribly off in his assumptions. But I think he draws the wrong conclusions. Bitcoin could certainly destabilize the state, but it wouldn't be a bad thing. In fact I'm impressed that he gave Bitcoin that much credit. Historically we've seen hit pieces that just dismiss Bitcoin. At least this author admitted that it has serious potential.

Over the years I've made a habit of sending friends Bitcoins to play with to let them get a feel for the currency. Despite all my efforts, many of these friends have since lost their wallets, reformatted their hard drives, etc.  
  
Now they are coming out of the woodwork: "OMG! Bitcoins are at $150! Why didn't you tell me they would be worth that much???"  
  
I even kept track of all the addresses that I sent to, so I can see all my poor lost lonely coins just sitting in the blockchain - and there they'll stay.  
  
But... some of my friends didn't lose their coins :)

You can say that the velocity of Bitcoins will decrease, but they will not disappear, which is the case with US dollars. When a debt is repaid, such as a mortgage, POOF! Those dollars no longer exist, not in practice nor in theory. With Bitcoin, the coins that are saved always have the potential to be spent, and at the right price, they will be.

I would argue that it is natural thinking, but in terms of your self-interest, you should only take into account how holding Bitcoin would affect you personally. If you believe it would be a risk worth taking, then that analysis should be independent of how your behavior will positively affect people that you don't know.

It's true that it makes it harder to turn a profit if the value is increasing very quickly. That said, you still make out alright since 18 bitcoins will then be enough to make perhaps 1.2 cars. yes, you could have done better to sit on your bitcoins, but you still haven't really lost out.

I would argue that I have an above average understanding of law, at least in the US. From a philosophical standpoint, ownership is a deep and fascinating topic, one which I am also quite familiar with. The article was an implicit expose on the definition of property, admittedly articulated in general terms for the sake of brevity and expression.

More probable is that the price of Bitcoin, which is set on the margin on the exchanges, affects the miner's switching their machines on/off, or deciding to invest in new hardware.  
  
With respect to whether miners would dump their coins on an exchange, I suspect that they are just like anybody else. They sell when they need the money, want the money, or expect the price to fall.

They would do it because they are getting richer. It's called the wealth effect and we saw it with the US housing bubble (as people's houses went up in value, they borrowed against them and spent the money on other things).

You should be a bit more respectful to the devs. They don't need a "rocket" up their asses. The transaction throttling isn't a weakness, it's a feature, which keeps mining healthy.  
  
The block sized will probably be raised or increased in size eventually, but this issue is well understood and the transition will be smooth.  
  
And yes, transactions which are not included in a block remain in the unconfirmed transaction pool until they are picked up eventually. It happens all the time today with fee less transactions and isn't a big deal.

Claim is from BBC article:  
  
"The FBI seized the virtual currency by getting hold of encryption keys for the bitcoins, according to Jerry Brito, George Mason University's technology policy director.
The keys were made available through seized computer equipment, Mr Brito said in a blog post."  
  
However, I just read Brito's [blog post]( and it seems that they are only "authorized" to seize them.  
  
With this in mind, the feds probably do NOT have the Bitcoins. My mistake.

Let's use a low dictionary amount of 25,000 words. That means there are 25,000^12 possible combinations, which is about 6^52, which is in the ballpark for the number of atoms on earth.  
  
So yeah, if you can find a computer that can go through that many combinations in less than a few hundred billion years, then you'll have an issue - an issue which could immediately be resolved by using longer word chains.

Yeah, the more I think about it, I realize that you're right - however, the main effect that a "selfish" pool could have would be to increase the average time between blocks by a small percentage - since it is in essence just smashing valid blocks that would have otherwise contributed to the chain.    
  
For instance, if this pool has 25% of the hashing power, then about 6% of the time at any given moment, they will find two blocks in a row. To the other miners, this represents a fairly small chance of being orphaned - in fact, this percentage isn't much different from the current chances of being out-propogated by another miner.
There is an incentive to join the pool, but it's pretty unimpressive.   
  
The bigger question might be: would this be a viable tool for mining pool operators to employ, even in a non-malicious way?

Deflation is different for debt-based currencies and hard currencies. The supply of dollars goes down during periods of deflation because dollars actually disappear when debts are repaid. The supply of Bitcoins will not decrease by the same mechanism.  
  
Bitcoins, similar to gold, could provide an environment of high growth and mild currency deflation (i.e. increased purchasing power over time) such as what we experienced for most of the 19th century in the US.

@_date: 2013-12-13 18:55:11
I agree. It's not a bad analysis. The author says transaction value and Bitcoin market valuation are out of whack, or velocity and Bitcoin market valuation are out of whack. OK, so let's give him that as a starting point: 
 
That may be so, but it doesn't answer 2 questions: 1) whether being "out of whack" is sustainable by any other standard, and 2) if this imbalance must resolve itself eventually, why Bitcoin market valuation should be expected to come down, as opposed to the other metrics catching up to keep pace.

In financial terms risk and reward are inextricably linked, despite your personal feelings on the matter. What I suspect you take issue with is people taking risks with other people's money or wellbeing without their consent, which is obviously unethical.

The first error I see is "Bitcoin is not a scarce resource at all---it is infinite in quantity." This is false. Bitcoin is limited to 21 million as you say.  
  
The second error is that the value of an infinitely divisible unit is zero. This is false. The value of the unit is a limit equation, and it approaches zero trivially. Technically the value is epsilon.  
  
Definitely a discussion worth having. This causes a lot of confusion. The trick is not to equate divisibility with quantity. Divvying something up doesn't make more of it, it just makes more pieces of it.

The world is so topsy-turvy. Just the fact that people have dismissed Bitcoin as the "MySpace" of crypto-currencies since the beginning may be a signal that it won't ever be overtaken. After all, the protocol is flexible. Any monstrously superior c-c could just be emulated.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:53:39
GDP is a measure of economic activity, which is dependent on currency velocity. If you want to say that Bitcoin can support $500B per year of economic activity, it would only take about $50B worth of Bitcoin (assuming a 10x velocity).  
  
That's the main issue that I would raise with your post. So under those assumptions, divide by 10 to get ~$2,380.  
  
What I think you are missing is Bitcoin's role as a store of value, which could be well north of 95% of its valuation. Break out the calculator!

Respectfully, wouldn't you prefer limited block sizes to make individuals compete with higher transaction fees to be in your block?  
  
I suppose the competition will always be there, but it was my understanding that a limited block size disincentivizes fee-less transactions.  
  
EDIT: Even today, miners often ignore large chunks of the unconfirmed transaction pool because of lack of tx fees; miners aren't missing out on fees today

To address your central point, of whether it is morally wrong to make something illegal if it has a high risk of massive negative consequences, I would say yes.

I agree. Lots of people are going to lose money. But in the long run, everybody can win from adopting Bitcoin. Once (if) it reaches saturation, everybody benefits from an honest, secure, and non/slowly-inflating global currency. But yes, a few people will make rash decisions and lose more money than they can afford to.  
  
Never speculate or invest with more than you can afford to lose!!!!!

Well, maybe you're right. But don't your arguments apply to any type of exchange; say for instance, an online stock broker like E-Trade? Plenty of people use it with almost zero risk of fraud or loss of funds.  
  
If you are claiming that exchanges threaten your anonymity, then yes that is true. But you could always trade Bitcoins via localbitcoins.com to remain anonymous.  
  
Volatility is obviously a deterrent for many people at the moment, but it's also a temptation for traders and speculators. If Bitcoin is going to realize its full potential it will have to be worth much more than it is today - it's clearly going to be a bumpy ride getting there. But it won't remain volatile forever. If the volatility concerns you, just sit it out until things settle down.  
  
Did I address your concerns? I'm trying to figure out whether it's volatility, risky exchanges, or loss of anonymity that is bothering you the most, since you mention all three.

I think you'll have a hard time getting an ROI even if you can source a new miner from KnC. Also, believe it or not, $10,000 is on the low end for mining investments. It might get you one new rig which churns out 0.5-1 TH/s. Delivery date uncertain.

Great point! As a hater of people who text while driving, I would not be opposed to provisions that enact greater penalties depending on the circumstances (btw, completely de rigueur in courtrooms).

Hi there. I'm glad you brought this up. I'm pretty far deep in the "no regulation whatsoever" camp, but at the same time I'm a pragmatist and I fully expect regulating agencies around the world to issue lots of regulatory guidance on an ongoing basis.  
  
Where I take issue is not with regulation that is truly designed to reduce fraud and deception, for example, but rather the kind that masquerades as consumer protection, but really is just political favoritism in disguise. For instance, today, a lot of the compliance requirements for the banking industry preclude new entrants due to their sheer expense. And in this regard, it reduces the competition that Hayek was trying to defend.  
  
The hard part is discerning which of our regulators are genuinely interested in creating reasonable frameworks and which are politically motivated. Personally, I can't tell the difference outright, so I end up just giving the finger to all of them.

That "ownership" is generally poorly defined and comes in different flavors, and that Bitcoin provides a relatively pure form of personal ownership.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:30:07
I suspect that economic inequality is something of a natural phenomenon. And in this particular case, the traunches are just proxies for adoption timing. If Bitcoin goes big, in 5 years, the headline will read, 1,000,000 people own half of the Bitcoins, since the user base will be maybe 10 times that - and it will include all members of the current "pie."
  
What I would be more concerned with is absolute poverty, rather than relative wealth. How do the poorest fare? In the case of Bitcoin, somebody with $10,000 might not be in the upper echelons of holders, but could have still benefitted from a 10x value increase, having only speculated with $1,000 to begin with. $10,000 is a lot of money to a lot of people, and in many ways I think that should be the real point of the article: "Bitcoin lifts 1,000,000 out of poverty" might be a bit of a hyperbole, but it's still more apt in my view than panning the differences between people's positions.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:12:46
A "serious" parabolic move would burn up all the sellers, but leave a trail with no buyers. You would get a correction, but it would be on low volume and wouldn't really mean anything.

That's a nice graph. Yes, I completely agree that inflation and deflation affect savers and debtors asymmetrically. The post only explored the advantages of having a viable alternative to investing and speculation to the poor. Reading the other response, I can see how it may have been more appropriate to expand the argument to the middle class: The POOR poor don't have any debt because they don't have credit and many, if not most, of the people with negative net worth are in fact middle class individuals who are underwater on their mortgages, or paying off large student loans.  
  
It would be a different post, but in the future perhaps I can address how stable currencies would affect the overall levels of debt to begin with.  
  
And perhaps another future post could investigate what a transition would look like from an inflationary to a stable currency supply. Clearly, there would be a lot of financial pains, at least in the short/medium term.

Thanks for the reference. I read the wikipedia article on Mutualism with great interest.  
  
I was particularly amused to learn of the term "libertarian socialist," which to me seemed even more strikingly implausible. Yet I suppose that political theory is rife with internal contradictions - just as we people often harbor simultaneous, yet irreconcilable beliefs on a regular basis.

Sure. Mt. Gox had its US bank accounts frozen about 6 months ago, so they have a lot of trouble processing USD withdrawals. They don't appear to be insolvent: the money is there - they just don't have access to it, and nobody really knows when that will happen.  
  
As a result, the Mt. Gox price is higher, since people who want to convert to dollars buy BTC (pushing up the price), then withdraw BTC and sell it at another exchange (pushing down the price). That's why Mt. Gox has higher prices than Bitstamp for instance.  
  
If you try Coinbase, you may be able to get cheaper coins. They are a broker, not an exchange, so they do mark up their prices. But you can usually find cheaper coins there than Mt. Gox.  
  
Hope that helps, let me know if you have any other questions.
EDIT: I have also heard that their customers are having trouble withdrawing BTC. So you may want to avoid Mt. Gox until they get everything sorted out.

It's completely relevant. Forex pairs move so little that you have to use leverage to trade them. To turn your trade into a profit, the pair may only need to move 0.015%, but because you've borrowed 100 times the cash you put up for the trade, the dollar amount ends up being a much higher percentage of your equity.   
  
Do you understand at this point or do you need some examples?

I see. Well at this early stage, regardless of the 12 or 13 other properties of Bitcoin that make it superior to fiat currencies, there is one overriding reason why anybody - whether and individual or a company - should be interested in Bitcoin, and that is as a purely speculative bet on its future valuation.  
  
Those who have done their research understand that if this currency gains any kind of mainstream adoption, whether as a transactional currency or as a store of value, that its valuation is going to have to increase another couple orders of magnitude. After that point, the other benefits (i.e. low transaction costs, near-immediate payment, global reach, etc.) begin to kick in more strongly.

With respect to the analogy, you are correct that people didn't outright sell rooms, but the borrowed money represented the fact that their house prices had increased recently. Having your assets increase is very similar to having new money dropped on your lap. You purchasing power has increased and you are likely to spend some of that newly acquired wealth.
  
Remember that there are also buyers on the other end of the equation. As the price goes up, they become less interested in purchasing the asset too. So as the price rises, eventually you hit a point where there is a standoff between savers and buyers, and the trend reverses.  
  
Regarding the wealth distribution. I think many people in the Bitcoin community (again, I don't speak for everybody, but I know that many do feel this way), are less interested in proportional wealth distribution and more interested in how Bitcoin would affect absolute poverty. We could design a society where we all have the same amount of wealth - but we might all be impoverished as a result of these policies. If every human being on earth has shelter over their heads, clothes on their backs, food on their table, the opportunity to grow their wealth through savings, and doesn't live in fear of being robbed, then who cares how much money the richest people have?

False. Banks can still loan promises to pay bitcoin, which people can decide whether to accept and circulate. Also, it's an open debate whether fractional reserve banking is a net-beneficial system.  
  


  
Hoarding is the same as saving. Getting interest on money is called lending.  
  


  
It can be. But debt cuts both ways. Debt used for mal-investments or consumption destroys wealth.  
  


  
Author is mistaking deflation due to money destruction (i.e. debts being paid off) with deflation due to an increase of goods and services relative to money supply.  
  


  
It's zero-sum in terms of Bitcoin units, but not in terms of purchasing power.  
  


  
It wasn't an accident, it was 30 years of theory and progress leading up to Satoshi solving the double-spend problem in a distributed way.

Hi Nicolas,  
I'd like to praise you for actually reading that book. After bashing Keynes for the better part of 5 years, I decided to read "The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money" for myself, and was surprised to find all sorts of information that I didn't expect.  
  
For instance, that Keynes and Hayek were friends, not just because they liked or respected each other, but because they actually agreed on a number of economic points. As an example, Keynes actually praised Hayek's seminal work "The Road to Serfdom" by stating "Morally and philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it."  
  
As for the theory which proscribes loose monetary policy to spur employment, Keynes admitted himself that it was something of a sneaky trick, illustrating how wages were "sticky" and that individuals were much more likely to feel richer if their salaries went up regardless of the relationship between wages and cost of living. But, he also hypothesized that one would get diminishing returns on employment after a while.  
  
In short, I really like when people read Keynes before criticizing him. He had a lot of odd ideas, and it's best to be critical of what he said, rather than what Paul Krugman says. I agree with you that Keynes probably would be enamored of Bitcoin. The same can't be said of Krugman, who has arguably taken some of Keynes more radical ideas and gone off the deep end with them.

@_date: 2013-04-08 14:47:10
yes. be careful not to a) lose your bitcoins or b) have them stolen.  
My recommendation would be to download bitaddress.org, turn off wifi, create a brainwallet. Test sending a small amount of coins to it and back (you can use blockchain.info). Then make a bulletproof brainwallet that you will never ever forget. Print out a paper copy of the wallet and put it in a safe. Make an excel spreadsheet, insert your private and public keys, then password protect it with a bulletproof password, name the file something innocuous and email it to yourself, and family members you care about.  
  
Wait 2 weeks. See if you still remember your brainwallet. Then fund it.
Edit: Also, don't ever type your brainwallet passphrase in the correct order in case you have a keylooger. Also, make sure this passphrase is at least 30 characters long, includes upper and lower case letters, special characters, and numbers.

In today's world, they are. It's completely legal.  
  
If you want to learn more about FRB, look up high-powered money vs. money supply.  
  
In this analogy, BTC is the high-powered money, and all of the "promises to pay" Bitcoin, which is the account balance displayed on Chalash's website, for example, exceed this amount by some factor. This is the money supply.  
  
Not to worry though, the market will be very cruel to companies that try and lend out other people's BTC unless it is explicitly understood by all parties. At that point, the FRB is kept in check by depositors, who are likely to keep an eye on the books and cause bank runs if there are too many shenanigans going on - since without a central bank or FDIC insurance, the depositors are on the hook for bank losses.

Correct. But that isn't the case here. 1.0 Bitcoins is the same as 1.000000 Bitcoins. 1 apple is the same as 1.0000000000 apple.  
  


  
This is called deflation, or specifically in this case, growth deflation. Not inflation.

I think you are being very reasonable. I've been thinking a bit about this, and it struck me that the label of money laundering is at the whim of regulators, meaning that tomorrow it could be legal to send Bitcoins to my friend, but the day after, it could be illegal. Suddenly, I am subject to money laundering laws, of which i know little about, and have much to fear.

You are absolutely correct that each solution has a different risk profile. Agreed, a well-encrypted wallet can be plastered all over the internet without much risk of being stolen. However, that password is at risk of being lost. If it is simply memorized it may be forgotten, and if it is written down somewhere, it may be stolen.  
  
A paper wallet is just a written-down password. Vulnerable, yes, but obviously inferior to an encrypted backup? I would argue no.

Every single time I travel, I wear one of my Bitcoin t-shirts to the airport. And only on the last occasion did somebody acknowledge it. I was going through security, going back and forth in the S-shaped line and this one guy kept crossing my path going the other direction and staring at me. I had forgotten that I was wearing a Bitcoin shirt but thought to myself "man, that guy looks super geeky. I bet he's a bitcoiner." Then eventually he pointed to my shirt and gave me the thumbs up and a smile, and I was like…… wait, I'm the geek.

If the USD undergoes rapid inflation, say on the scale of 10-20% per year for an extended period, would the author change his mind? I agree that high volatility can undermine a currency. But there is a chicken and egg issue at hand. Sound money, when employed as a currency, shows very little volatility, as evidenced by the 1800's in the US. I would argue that if Bitcoin were to ever gain widespread adoption, that it would fall into a narrow volatility range just like other national currencies.
Edit: spelling

A good quick and dirty is to make a brain wallet with bitaddress.org using 3 excerpts from songs or poems that you like and will never forget. Add something unique to the end. Make sure it's at least 50+ characters and that you will never forget it. 
Put the private key in a password protected word or excel file and email it to yourself and your next of kin. 
Fund the wallet and let it be. 
Disclaimer: you should always test any new process. If you are going to do this, then try it out first with 0.01 bitcoin or so. Make sure you know how to load your private key into a client and get control over your coins again. Also make sure you look up change addresses. Seriously, look it up

I think the issue is with your definition of "quantity." In your gold analogy, quantity is associated with weight. If you have 1oz. of gold, it doesn't matter how many times you slice and dice it, you'll never increase its quantity: 1oz.

I'm with on on at least one point: People tend to ridicule the bitcoiners for not understanding economics - but as far as I can tell, Bitcoin is generating a large group of people who previously had no interest in the topic, and now at least understand how markets work, and perhaps even a bit about what money is.

This post is 7 hours old and has one comment? I'm flabbergasted. The most interesting part of this video was getting a look under the hood.

I have little doubt that in 10 years, Bitcoin will wipe the floor with current payment options... no disrespect to the entrepreneurs who designed the credit card networks (also geniuses in my book).

Exactly my point. Nobody would do that. The author mistakenly conflated libertarianism, which at its root is the rejection of force against other people, and capitalism, which is defined by personal ownership of the means of production.  
  
They go hand in hand: respect other people and their stuff.

Interesting. I guess that price differentials on two different markets (whether internal or external, but connected nonetheless) could be the result of both purposeful manipulation, or benign market activity.

I think we're in general agreement about how the market works. But I think we disagree on how easy it is to pull off such a scheme. There is still significant risk that you will lose money when you try to game the market.

It used to be a lot easier to buy them before Mt. Gox fell onto FinCEN's radar. 25c charge from Dwolla to send unlimited funds to Mt. Gox then a 0.6% transaction buy fee (tiered lower at higher volumes). Not much waiting and no verified accounts malarky.  
  
What everybody else says is true though: that once you have them, it's like stepping outside of a barbed-wire fence and into the field from the "Sound of Music." You never want to go back. The technology works fantastically, and even though there is a paucity of vendors at the moment, the number is increasing rapidly.

Perhaps you can warm his heart by addressing what he is actually worried about. In this context, scam = Ponzi scheme.  
  
Ponzi schemes are fraudulent investment programs where old investors are paid off by new investor money. They are fundamentally unsustainable because eventually there are not enough new investors  
BTC is not an investment program, it is a currency. There are no promises around returns, and no party to make those promises because there is no central BTC company or authority  
Increases in BTC value are sustainable even once the last adopter joins the group because of its usefulness, i.e. it does rely on new investors or adopters to support the value as the value is determined by its usefulness as a store of value and a means of exchange  
There are risks associated with holding BTC, but that are not the same risks assumed by those participating in a Ponzi scheme

It should work, but you might run into withdrawal trouble if you aren't "verified" with them, meaning you'll have to send in photo IDs and proof of residence stuff. Probably best to test with an extremely small amount of BTC to get it set up before you start trying your hand at trading.  
  
Also, don't trade. You'll lose money.
