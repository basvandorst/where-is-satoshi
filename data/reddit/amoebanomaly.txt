This is true for me 100% except that the bear market pushed me to get really good at programming and now I'm working on preparing for interviews with Google, Microsoft, Netflix, etc. So thanks for the massive bear market I guess...

I have a STEM degree but not coding related. I learned some on the job and mostly self taught. I've been a programmer for about 6 years, but I've only seen it as something I could exceptional at in the last year and a half or so. I expect a FAANG job is still a couple years away for me but I study outside of work all the time now and I more or less double my capabilities every year.
You don't need to go to school if you don't want to. Just start from the beginning, read books thoroughly, build applications, use LeetCode or something similar, etc.

v true, that's why only the craziest people bought when btc was in the 3k range. it looked like it was dumping endlessly.

during the last bull i had the most backwards schedule i've ever had. I was routinely going to bed after 5AM and sleeping until late afternoon. yesterday out of nowhere I couldn't fall asleep until after 6AM.

True, also just gives credence to the "crypto is horseshit" argument when we have rapid climbs like this. But w/e I'm here for it.

legendary bug. this game swallowed an entire summer of mine when i was a teenager. since getting hooked on counter-strike, warcraft 3, and diablo II since I was 12 it's no wonder I have palpable social anxiety haha...dammit.
and now i'm a programmer so the tradition of staring at a screen all day lives on.

i feel that we have a lot of systems in place to mask the fact that it is kill or be killed and has been for some time

I'm at least glad that I don't live with this kind of delusion. But I guess stranger things have happened.

really should not ever give BTC as a gift unless they've said that they want BTC as a gift. basically no one ever cares as much as you do and theyll probably lose the seed lol. but it's a neat thing you made there OP.
