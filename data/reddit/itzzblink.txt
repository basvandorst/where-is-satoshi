Coinbase is really convenient. You just need to move it out of coinbase ASAP

I haven't heard of Samurai before, but yes. Just find the receiving address in Samurai and send your bitcoin from Coinbase to there.

A hardware wallet such as Trezor or Nano S is a pretty good idea, however they're kinda expensive and not worth it if you only have a small amount.
Another option is an app on your phone, just *make sure* you keep copies of the recovery words with you in case your phone breaks. I personally use breadwallet. I used to use Mycelium, but it appears that they're not on the iOS app store anymore, but I did like it while I used it.
These aren't the only options. there are desktop apps too, but I don't know anything about those so I can't recommend any.

No I get you 100%, but there’s a difference between a shitty fork and a scam.
Hate bcash all you want, but there’s a team behind it and a community that loves it. Just because they have a different vision doesn’t mean that it’s a scam

"REEEEEE BCASH IS SLANDERING BTC"  
*someone slanders bcash in front of parliament*  
"OMG HERO"
I don't like Bcash, and Roger Ver is a bitch, but you can't complain about slander in a thread promoting slander.

I've always thought about that, but in reality I probably would have sold once it hit a dollar, probably sooner even. Definitely wouldn't have made it to 20k
