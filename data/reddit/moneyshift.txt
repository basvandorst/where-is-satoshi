Hey fucktards, you're not done with the refunds.  You still owe my friend and I $14K for two miners.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:25:14
I won't lie and say we were completely ignorant of the issues surrounding the miner manufacturers but the issues were not as well known, generally speaking, when we placed the order six months ago. If you think it was 100% clear six months ago that HF was intentionally participating in a fraud, I think that's disingenuous.  
For the record we didn't just go clickity-clicking their website to put a $14K order in our cart.  We did our due diligence.  We researched the companies to the extent possible, determined if they were headquartered in the US, etc. and spoke to an actual human being to confirm the wire transfer, who then told us that the system would ship by the end of Februrary, 30 days ahead of the date published on the website.
If foresight was EVER realistically 20/20 or anything close to it, we wouldn't need a legal system because no one would ever enter a deal they thought would go south.

At time of pre-order.
We ordered 2 Sierras (1.2TH min) in Batch 4.  They were like $6500 at the time, plus my buddy opted for next day shipping (understandable given the difficulty increases).  Right after we ordered HF raised the price of those to $7500 or something like that before ultimately halting sales.  We thought at the time we got a deal (hah!) We wired them USD rather than use BTC because we thought BTC was headed much higher in the short term (hah!)

I'm talking about customer service needed to address policies and other issues on their service.  Learn 2 read.
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:15:15
I hope I am underestimating here...I'm just trying to be realistic.
@_date: 2014-12-01 03:22:17
I tried selling via Amazon but their "customer service" is absolutely laughable -- it's nothing more than a bunch of stupid monkeys sending boilerplate messages that repeat the original problem and do nothing to solve it.
Amazon is only convenient for the buyer.  Sellers are left hanging if anything goes wrong.  Oh, and they steal like 10% of every sale for the privilege. Fuck Amazon.

Personally, when BTC hits $10K I'm planning to buy a lot of cocaine and hookers with my coins.  Please people, let's make this happen.
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:26:33
Thanks for that link.  I've been on the net well before the web existed and I had never heard of that....though I do remember what happened to UseNet when the fucking AOLers hit.
@_date: 2014-04-16 14:15:21
My buddy and I were considering cointerra but passed.  Unfortunately, we chose hashfast and they're just as big of a fucking fraud of a company.
Don't buy any ASICs unless they are reasonably priced and the company promises shipment within 24-48 hours (meaning, they have them in stock).  Otherwise you're going to get fucked.
@_date: 2014-05-12 13:16:12
I think you misspelled fraud.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:06:33
While BTC can replace credit cards in terms of convenience, unless the devs figure out a way to establish credit within the core of the BTC network, perhaps created by others in the community willing to extend that credit, with creditworthiness perhaps defined by one's existing holdings of BTC, BTC will never replace them.
Put more simply: credit cards will continue to exist as long as people wish to (or need to) spend more than they make.
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:58:33
If you're trying to be funny, I can assure you losing $14K to a fraudulent business is anything but a laughing matter.
Hindsight is always 20/20.

Krugman is an idiot in general, as he continues to push his ridiculous keynesian "spend our way to prosperity" economic ideology, so that statement of record does not surprise me in the slightest.
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:36:20
[Mish]( has been saying this for years:
The Fed is pushing on a string.
They can "print" all they want, but they can't make banks lend or people spend.  
I find these statements particularly hypocritical given that banks are holding record amounts of reserves at the Fed.  It's making diddly, but that's low risk as compared to lending it to average people who will likely not be able to pay it back in the long run given how the entire economy is a sham, propped up by free money as it is.
@_date: 2014-02-22 13:31:57
Probably fair to say that if they don't do this, stick a fork in them because they're done.

Amen.  Mining rigs are not about being pretty.  They are temporary setups designed to serve a single purpose...an appliance if you will.  They don't need a fancy case.  I call it "gorilla computing", taken from "gorilla warefare".  It's ugly and it's the antithesis of protocol, but it gets the job done.
And any basic thermal simulation would reveal that's a horrible way to cool the cards.  This design might cool the bottom of the cards but there will be hot spots between the fans and the tops (near the VRMs) will likely be screaming hot.  The proper solution would involve high volume (and loud, unfortunately) radial blowers mounted on the bottom pushing air through a sealed plenum.  This is the way we do it in the carrier equipment biz and it works.
Oh, and August 2014 delivery?  Guess these guys are taking a page from the mining hardware manufacturers' playbook.  Take lots of preorders for things that will be irrevelvant by the time they're delivered.  Nice try.  Next!

While I can see your point I think the problem is not so much the demand for the products as much as the companies providing them.
Among other things, I'm in the niche market manufacturing business (unrelated to mining) and there's one thing I will never do as a matter of principle -- ask customers to pay me before I'm ready to ship.  If I do need money to fund development and/or production I'll use my own money or talk to a bank or maybe an angel and wrap the cost of that money into the product.  If the miner manufacturers did the same thing there would be no issues.
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:49:51
I'm pretty tired... I think I'll go home now.
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:16:32
Paypal is probably the best way at this point since I don't have a ton of BTC.  I'm okay with $25 + postage to 07728.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:31:54
No, they owe $14K because overnight shpping was nearly $500 per unit as I recall.  They later lowered that estimate after they had a better grasp on the size and weight of the equipment, but we still paid them for a service we did not receive.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:40:56
Dude.  I so want to buy that shirt.
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:37:50
I think it's premature to suggest that banks in general are fucked, but PayPal...oh my God...can't wait to see the smoking hole created by those fuckers blowing up.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:08:34
I'd gladly go back to the early 90's (pre AOL) UseNet over what we have now.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:21:12
I own 0 BTC and I agree with you.  Like we say to stupid parents who think TV is the root of all evil with their stupid kids, if you don't like what you see, don't watch.
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:15:53
Which is precisely why the PoW should be changed so that average people can mine again.
@_date: 2016-01-20 02:45:38
Say what you want about Doge, but their devs actually took action when they recognized a need to change / improve the coin.  BTC devs just sit on their hands debating everything and in the process delay any real progress.
While BTC is important to many people, the time to iron out the kinks in Satoshi's original vision is RIGHT NOW, precisely because BTC is not as critical as it might one day be.  The longer we wait to take action, the more difficult and risky it will be to do so.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:35:44
I still chuckle at the devs who so fear a hard fork, saying its "untested".
I mined alt coins including doge that hard forked at least two times that I can recall. The devs announced the fork on their website.  Everyone else spread the news that the software had to be updated before block X, estimated to arrive on such and such a date, and people just updated.  It literally was that simple.
Yea, we had a few pools who were run by morons who could barely keep it running on a good day and they balked simply because it was more work for them, but they eventually got their shit together or their blocks got rejected (as they should be).
The fact that BTC has never hard forked is an oddity, and should not be used as a justification for inaction.
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:59:26
My understanding (which may be wrong) is that it accomplishes this by editing the transaction, as opposed to somehow creating a new transaction that references the old transaction.
If my take on that is correct, that is wrong on so many levels, including basic accounting doctrine, that it's ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:48:04
More terrible than a handful of companies producing the only hardware that can realistically mine the coin?
More terrible than a handful of companies located in a country run by an oppressive regime owning more than 50% of the hashing power?
To be frank, when the average guy with a spare computer can't mine the coin the mining process is horribly broken and the PoW should be changed.  People shit all over alt coins specifically designed to be ASIC resistant, but they're not looking like idiots now, IMO.
The PoW algo should be rotated every few months or constructed in such a way that it is ASIC resistant. That way the mining goes back to software / firmware (i.e. GPUs, realistically), difficulty drops back to a realistic value, and the coin becomes more decentralized again, as it was originally designed to be.

Merely 20 years ago I once travelled via the airlines with almost $50K in cash stuffed in pockets going to buy an airplane on short notice.  I wasn't patted down in those days -- I merely walked through the metal detector and went on my way -- which is exactly how it should be today.
I find it truly sad that merely travelling with money is now considered suspicious behavior.  If the government doesn't have probable cause to consider me a drug dealer or to have received those funds in an illegal operation, they have no fucking business knowing I'm travelling with cash.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:28:03


Could not have said this better myself.
As a user, I cannot tolerate 10+ minute confirmations.  I want my transaction to go through in seconds.  Not minutes.  That means third party / off-chain solutions and settlement only on the primary blockchain.  The off-chain solutions can realistically tolerate pretty much any confirmation time that gets them their money same day / close of business.  Which is still better than the commercial banking networks provide currently.
For example: I did a wire transfer the other day to a test equipment manufacturer for $14K.  Took a $35 fee and 4 hours to get someone to electronically transfer the money into the manufacturer's account, and then another 3 day hold on their end because, well...bankers are fucking worthless parasites that like holding on to people's money for no fucking reason.

I think this is proof positive that good web designers are in fact quite rare.  Most are bandwagon types that turn otherwise good websites into shit because it follows the current trend, like ridiculously long pages and using javascript to smooth scroll.  Even big commercial sites I use have gone to that model and it infuriates me.

It's almost as if Thatcher was right.  The problem with socialism is eventually you run out of other people's money.  
And when that happens, you tax everyone to hell and back and make cash illegal so you can make sure everyone is paying their share.

The EU is a broken concept.  Was from the start, and there's one reason why: all rule changes require the approval of all nations.  That is virtually impossible to achieve, when it is quite clear now that all nations cannot be treated equally or be expected to act equally and all it takes is one country, in its own self interest, say Greece or France, to block needed reforms.
Good luck with that steaming pile over there.  For all the shit we deal with in the US, all the corruption, all the waste...at least we still have the means to change policy by majority rule.
