I will certainly acknowledge that Bitcoin is useful for those on society's margins. Centralization does make it easier for governments to impose control on currency. The main issue I would raise with this point is that Bitcoin is increasingly becoming centralized in that off chain transactions are far more common place. I received a doge tip just now: through a centralized service. There is no reason these increasingly centralized services should not come under government scrutiny and regulation, as they currently are.
However I do question its use as a store of value. Even removed from the insane volatility it has experienced, Bitcoin is no better a store of value than any other asset. In a time of inflation, every asset aside from the monetary unit rises in value. If you bought .45 ammunition, for instance, it's value will increase the same as, if not more than, Bitcoin will measured in the local monetary unit. Real wealth is measured in assets, not dollars.

Nothing illegal really happened on the banks end. A customer made a deposit in an account, likely using a handwritten deposit slip. 3 hours later, the customer comes to the bank and says they must have deposited the money into the wrong account, it could have been caused simply by writing the wrong number on the deposit slip. So the bank does what banks do best, they reverse the incorrect deposit and give him his cash back. This probably happens all the time, so the bank likely did not give it a second thought.
The mistake you made was using the bank in a way it wasn't designed to be used. Typically the only people who should be making deposits into your account is you, or possibly your employer or other financial services. Not some guy handwriting a deposit slip. That's why you can't buy things from real businesses by promising to go to the bank and deposit cash in their name.

Debt isn't inherently bad, why would you want to be free of it? Without debt, many businesses wouldn't have ever started. For instance you probably have a local restaurant you like. They went to a bank and got a loan, which they then used productively. Debt you cannot afford is a bad thing, but debt in general is good, because it allows people access to capital they would not otherwise have.

Because it's a highly liquid market with customers all over the world? Foreign exchange is used by any company that operates multinationally. Pure speculation is a sideshow compared to the massive volume of companies converting currency and hedging against fluctuations in value.

The main property of gold that made it useful was that it was hard to counterfeit. Modern currency is increasingly hard to counterfeit. Given the choice between an efficient centralized currency that is difficult to counterfeit, and an inefficient decentralized currency that is also difficult to counterfeit, I see no reason to take the inefficient currency.
Additionally, remember that Bitcoin may well have been effectively counterfeited on a large scale in the Mt. Gox fiasco. In the increasingly common centralized exchanges and tipping services, there is little to stop a manager from simply changing the database entries that control the service. Discovery would not truly occur until there are already issues with withdrawal, at which point value has already been destroyed.
With regard to Twitter: it's a centralized service. If the U.S. government so desired, Twitter could be shuttered by use of force. The Internet is a powerful force for mass communication, but remember that control rests with a small few.

Corruption of the law doesn't mean that the law is worthless. Taxation is very necessary to do things that individuals would have a hard time doing on their own.

It's not free. Have you considered the cost of accounting for it in your financials, as well as the additional tax compliance costs? Additionally you'll need to pay exchange costs if you want it in dollars, which can bring in conversion gains and losses. There is very much a cost to accepting bitcoins, you just haven't considered them.
Also, consider the opportunity costs of setting up the bitcoin payment system, if that's time you can be using productively otherwise, that's another cost to consider, unless you consider your time worthless.

No, but they need to be kept contemporaneously with the transaction. Also if you want to just claim a ton of losses you're going to need to establish your cost basis, which would require records of your purchase, also kept contemporaneously.

There is a very good chance bitcoin doesn't go mainstream, and that the IRS audits the fuck out of anyone with material bitcoin gains on their return, I guarantee you the audit software is looking for the words "bitcoin" or "virtual currency". So if a few years later you claim a big gain that you use to buy a car, expect a serious examination of your taxes.

How much money do you make holding Bitcoin that isn't capital appreciation (more realistically, depreciation)? You make zero holding Bitcoin.
Stocks pay dividends and are valued based on those dividends. With zero cash flows from holding Bitcoin you're left with just praying the price goes up, which hasn't happened in 16 months.

This is how you determine how much taxable gain you made on a sale of (or purchase of goods with) Bitcoin. All the references are to the 26th Title to the United States Code, known as the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It is tax law.
Section 1001(a). Gain (loss) is the amount realized (cash, goods, altcoins at USD FMV) less the adjusted basis.
Adjusted basis is defined in Section 1011(a) as what is stated in 1012.
Section 1012 states that basis is cost, except as where otherwise provided. Now feel free to put your self to look for crypto currency in the IRC, but you will not find it otherwise provided. The only guidance that exists states the Bitcoin is treated generically as property in Notice 2014-21.  
So gain (loss) is simply what you made selling a Bitcoin versus what you paid. But how much tax do you owe? First, we need to figure out if Bitcoin is capital property. Let's take a peek at Section 1221. Sec. 1221 says everything is capital property except for certain things like inventory or accounts receivable (important in a business context but not here). 
So how much tax do you owe? Flip your leather bound copy of the Internal Revenue Code (autographed by Ronald Reagan himself!) to Section 1(h), colorfully called "Tax imposed." It states that the bottom two tax brackets pay no tax, the middle two only pay 15% of the amount of the gain and the highest pay 20%. 
Keep in mind this is for long term gains, which are defined in Section 1222(3) as being from property held longer than a year. So you need to really hold to get preferential tax treatment. If they're held for less than a year it's ordinary income. 
So for example, Ross Ulbricht buys 10,000 Bitcoins for $40 in early 2010. He then sells them in December 2013 for $1,100/coin, realizing and recognizing a $10,999,960 long term capital gain on the sale. Assuming he's in the top tax bracket, he pays $2,199,992 in capital gains tax, along with the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax of $417,998.48. 
That's how it works. There's nothing in the IRC to argue otherwise.

Large scale growth doesn't just happen because everyone chips in ten bucks. Companies like Apple, GM, Ford, Exxon-Mobil, big, gigantic, economy-moving companies don't just happen, they require a system of finance based on return for risk. Financing large scale projects is much harder under a deflationary system. 
You can't just say that our economic system isn't working. Look at the absurd advances in technology and standard of living we've made under modern finance and central banking. You can't just say that's not progress.
Bitcoin may solve the two generals problem, but that doesn't mean it's made a deflationary currency a good idea.

There is no reason to do any of that if you can just earn a return on your bitcoin with literally zero risk. It makes no financial sense. 
Also, your savings don't "disappear into the banking black whole". If you're managing your funds correctly you should be earning a return from investments. Banks are mutually benefitting themselves and consumers with checking and savings accounts, providing security for your funds (as well as FDIC protection) while also allowing you easy access to funds and a (very very modest) return.
There are reasons that we use the current inflationary system, and that is because it encourages investment and economic growth. Throwing out all the lessons we've learned over the last few hundred years for bitcoin is truly ignorant of the economic and financial advances we've made.

Debt has taken on a very bad name in today's world and especially among the reddit and bitcoin demographic. You see debt and think student loan or mortgage crisis, but the reality is that a huge portion of debt is used as financing for businesses of all sizes. The ability to take on debt is vital for the growth of an economy, as without debt a huge portion of financing becomes impossible. Under a deflationary system, there is no incentive for those holding capital to lend it, as the value of their holdings simply increases just sitting under their mattress with literally none of the risk involved with investing. Further, debt becomes more and more unaffordable to the borrower under a deflationary system. Imagine you had taken out a 10,000 bitcoin loan when the prices was a $1/bitcoin, with the balance of the loan due January 1, 2014. You've taken a loan worth $10,000 and turned it into a loan worth ~$7,000,000, a huge burden on the borrower. Obviously in a pure bitcoin environment this wouldn't be so dramatic, but the point stands: there is no incentive to engage in debt based financing for either party. 
You make the point that bitcoin is simply a middle man for fiat currency, so there are no loans, wages or prices set purely in bitcoin. If this is so, it appears that bitcoin is just a way for payments to be processed in a decentralized way, providing a way to make online payments for those without access to traditional banking. This could certainly be a good application for bitcoin, but the point stands that a deflationary currency would be terrible for growing an economy, and thus bitcoin should remain in the realm of those without access to traditional financial services, not as a replacement for modern finance.

That society is wasteful has no bearing on the necessity of debt. The government labs you (correctly) hold in high regard are funded by two things: taxes and debt. 
Without debt, a large number of businesses would have never gotten off the ground. Imagine a world where small businesses are unable to obtain a loan from a bank, or even friends and family, because anyone with capital has the option to just sit on their fortunes earning a return with literally zero risk. You would have to be irrational to lend money in such an environment, or be promised a very large return compared to the rate of growth of your uninvested money. Thus, economic activity would stagnate, and the corporate and individual income tax bases would be minuscule, incapable of funding the most basic of governmental services, let alone research.
Further, there would be no need to purchase government debt, another vital source of funding for government activities. Government debt serves both the purpose of funding government and acting as a risk-free safe haven against inflation for capital. If one could simply hold their funds and see growth, no one would need or want to purchase government debt, starving a government of funds.
It should be obvious why many libertarians and anarchists favor deflationary currency: it starves governments of funding, and prevents them from doing much at all.
