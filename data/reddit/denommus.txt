Anyway, having other service is always good to avoid monopoly.

I see democracy as a stage, not an objective *per se*. We have a democracy now while an anarchy or anything like it is not really possible.

The point is that gold is LESS infallible than bitcoins, because it is EASIER to falsify gold.

I can do this, too. Anyone can. Bitcoin is open source, after all.

Well, you are one. 7 billions are 7 billions. You can't force them to agree with you on what's moral. That's immoral, ironically.

I think you misunderstood him.
More bitcoins in the market means supply. So the price of bitcoin will fall.
More people buying bitcoins means more demand. So the price of bitcoin will rise.
The price of bitcoin is directly proportional to the demand, and inversely proportional to the supply.

Beautiful on theory. But it's hard to direct 7 billions people on that direction.

You could buy a physical bitcoin. It comes with a code that you can use to deposit it in your wallet.

Yes, this is a market as any other, but calling people communists because they don't agree with you is a big step into dickness.

This is the first time this meme was actually funny.

I can buy some bitcoins personally from you, since I'm from Manaus. But I won't be able to cover much. My payment is late, and I'm waiting to see if tomorrow I'll receive my money.
But PM me, anyway.

I wasn't the one defending any of these things, but I'm no anarcho-capitalist. I don't want to discuss under your terms.
@_date: 2012-10-11 12:09:54
What solution do you suggest?
@_date: 2012-11-21 14:42:14
They want a free and open internet because they profit from a free and open internet. They aren't the "good guys", but at least, on this instance, they're on my side, sharing the same interests with me.
I don't want them to data mine me. But I don't want the government doing that, either.

At the current moment, registering is disabled, and we don't know what plans the future owner has for the site.

The numbers on my debt card are printed, and it works just fine, thank you.

Gold can be *hacked*, too. A great percentage of the gold in the world is actually false. It's tungsten. So you're only being crazy.
And I imagine that paper money were treated with as much confidence on the first days than bitcoins. After all, cash can be falsified, burnt, and it is not *real*.

That's not so bad, considering the benefits. I have health plan, food (I'm not sure how to translate this benefit to English), and fuel. Also, the living cost on my country/city is not that high.
I live spetacularly well, considering that I'm junior level.

Because, obviously, the writers and the artists on the movie are the ones that profit from it, not guys in a suit that never participated of anything.
