I'm pretty sure these ATMs require KYC. Maybe someone that has used one recently can confirm?

Why would you use an ATM at a casino? Why would you use a Bitcoin ATM?
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:52:32
Right but the government is scared of bitcoin and knows it has potential of going up hundreds or thousands of % from here so they want a log so they can collect their precious tax from Joe schmo who bought $1000 worth of bitcoin in 2019.

No different than cash ATM. You go to a cash ATM and pay anywhere from $3 to $7 to get $50 out.

Robinhood does not allow crypto withdrawals. Also, they store your password in plain text.

Thank you for the source. Someone posted this a week or 2 ago but couldn't source it!

Looks more like disbelief. Aka suckers rally. What happens next? ��

While true, the same could be said about credit/debit cards. Not sure if you're old enough to remember when people still processed credit cards using pen and paper and that little slidy thing to engrave the credit card into the paper? It's progress.

Go to any shit hole gas station or a casino. Casinos charge as much as $10 to get money out.
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:57:45
I'm not a slave? My point is if they are going to regulate Bitcoin ATMs, they should also regulate cash ATMs who have been doing this for many many years.
@_date: 2019-07-10 04:38:39
I don't understand? You're saying that it's odd that USDT goes up before the price of Bitcoin? Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't it make sense when an investor adds money to the exchange that USDT will be created thus causing USDT market cap to increase, and then the investor uses their USDT to buy Bitcoin... Causing bitcoin to go up?? Doesn't sound odd to me?
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:31:16
That's not the point of the post... If cash ATMs aren't "wrong" for over charging why is Bitcoin ATM?
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:42:58
You have to be a bafoon to use a Bitcoin ATM also at 10% lol.
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:48:03
Ah I only said thta because I remember quite a while ago when coinstar added a bitcoin redemption option someone specifically asked and the answer was that they did have kyc implemented somehow. I figured it would be the same for the ATMs. Maybe not.
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:20:54
Ah OK. Not familiar with cash app
@_date: 2019-03-19 21:10:08
I don't get why people use wallets that store your keys online? Why not just use a wallet that stores the keys locally? 
@_date: 2019-03-20 01:45:31
Lol not me. But Kraken assigned me a personal CSR with priority support when I need it. Now if all you COINBASE fools can switch to kraken and increase the volume, that would be great.

Good shit this is what's needed! I've been playing with lightning but don't steam. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 01:10:15
So the keys are not backed up to their servers? If a noob lost their phone and didn't know enough to write down their recovery code, their crypto would be gone forever?
Very much could be the case, I was just assuming based on their selling point that "Android users could now take their keys offline" meaning that everyone who doesn't, has their keys stored online. Which could also be interpretedl different ways also as keys stored even on phones are at risk of hackers.
Maybe I should just install it and check it out lol. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 01:23:21
Yes, I suppose it would be rather annoying to receive bitcoin as a tip if you have no clue how to use it.  I still don't think it would make you an asshole to make sure they actually take it rather than letting it go to trash... Though if it does go to trash, that's ultimately good for the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-22 22:35:02
Easy solution to that. Write a note that if it's not moved out of the wallet in like 10 days, that you will take it back. Keep the key to make sure they move the money.

What are some of these features that trust wallet doesn't have for instance? 
@_date: 2019-03-26 06:13:19
How do they implement a donation message that pops up on stream though? 90% of the reason people donate is for recognition. (ok maybe I pulled that number out of my ass, but I know it's a high percentage.) 
@_date: 2019-03-20 17:30:18
Certainly not saying it's not good for crypto in general. Just responding to the guy above me that said they didn't do their research. I'm saying it doesn't matter to them as they aren't ever at risk by accepting shit coins. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 06:22:44
Sure sure a lot do. But they want to get noticed by their favorite streamer. Tons of streamers have crypto addresses in their descriptions, I've checked them and few ever have any donations in them.

It's not "safe" to sell anything on PayPal. Not in the sense that PayPal will steal your money or anything, but the fact that buyers can open and win disputes easily through PayPal or their credit card companies. Every time you sell something on PayPal, you run the risk of selling to a dishonest buyer that can fuck you. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 01:32:23
Ah OK. I was thrown off by the whole "Android users can take their keys offline" thing. But i get what they are saying. I'll have to check out the app. Have been looking for a good mobile app. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 22:05:59
Trust now has Bitcoin as well as most other coins. At least all that I own except EOS that they say they are working on. I tried out Atomic and Trust last night and ended up sticking with trust for now simply because I can scan QR wallet codes using my phone where you couldn't with atomic. Lol I'm not trying to call you out by the way. Genuinely curious. Even while planning on only keeping a few hundred in my mobile wallet at a time, I don't see the benefits over the risks of using a server based wallet. I'm a trader and have no clue what the liquid feature is. Guess I'll have to look into it. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 19:24:22
Does not matter what they accept. It just gets processed and sold into fiat immediately anyways. Would be too risky for a business that size to accept crypto and just let it sit in a wallet with the risk of an overnight market dump. 
@_date: 2019-08-05 04:15:57
So many ways to look at this. I want to see distribution imo. Don't want a few people at the top to hold a majority of the coin because that won't end well.
@_date: 2019-06-19 01:22:56
Right. It's more about getting the Bitcoin logo into stores. Though I'm skeptical without a link to the actual source.
@_date: 2019-06-19 01:33:43
Yep. ATT does and I've paid with Bitcoin. But I pay my phone bill and walk away. If the transaction fails, I would still have to pay to continue my service. If I walk out of a gas station and the transaction fails. Somebody is losing out on that money. Whether Sheetz or whoever they are using for processing. It's realistic with Lightning and it would be the first I've seen lightning implemented anywhere.  But I am skeptical without seeing seeing a direct source.

@_date: 2019-06-19 01:03:39
Endless $50 tanks on lightning? How many people do you think are going to use Bitcoin at 6 gas stations? ��

You can get a state ID. Similar to a driver's license but not for driving.

BCH shouldn't exist.

This is coming! It has to be lol. I have been dreaming of this since mid 2017!

I love how the payment options are larger than the name of the business LOL
@_date: 2019-06-19 01:02:16
Link to source please?
@_date: 2019-04-10 04:53:50
It already was a thing in 2017 ��
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:03:11
It was so incredibly overbought on every timeframe... Good buying opportunity for continuation once the RSI on the daily cools off.
