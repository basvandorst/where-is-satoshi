You're talking about extremely rare hypotheticals, while people lose bitcoins every single day.  You're also saying "There is no risk*  (as long as you blah blah blah blah) and so there actually is risk -- a shit ton of risk actually.  There are probably few things you can spend your money on right now that are as risky as a cryptocurrency, in fact, aside from gambling and penny stocks, and those are places where there is no question or lying about the risks.  Comparing the risk of losing money in a bank account to losing bitcoins is absurd.

I think you're taking the example too literally.  There's not an actual guy eating a sandwich.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:14:25
Technically yes, but mining inherently "processes" transactions.  A number of transactions get put on the blockchain with each subsequent successfully mined bitcoin.  So basically the amount of power it takes to mine a bitcoin divided by the number of transactions in the block == power to "process" a transaction, in essence.

Assuming it's ordered from size, business, market, industry, economic, market in this case would be appropriate word for cryptocurrency, but the "financial market" is in reference to the overall economy.  Anyway, we're splitting hairs over which "market" the definition of "boom" is referring to which doesn't matter... because I'd say, you're comparing the price of bitcoin to a financial market boom?  It's the same question either way.  It's nothing compared to anything in that article.

Coinbase is the closest thing to mainstream that bitcoin offers though is the point I think.  So it doesn't matter that it isn't bitcoin.  It's the easiest (am I wrong?) to use, and it's basically worthless unless you want to buy and hold or sell.  That's not revolutionary.  That's a $4 discount on a wire transfer [...that has the added benefit of potentially being scooped by malware on either end... awesome.]
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:41:21
Get over yourself.  Bitcoin is not even close to being revolutionary.  It can't even support the god damned transaction volume on the network.  Maybe it will be some day but it's not even close to being that day and a million things could happen between then and now.
Also, look at what's happening to the US government right now.  There's a much bigger chance of a social revolution due to the unbridled corruption and corporate influence over the legislative body.  Bitcoin?  Stop romanticizing.

Nobody is forcing you to buy anything.  Sales tax would require that you buy something in order for it to be paid.  So, no.
Look, I get that government wastes money like there's no tomorrow.  But the whole anti-tax libertarian argument is born out of prepubescent ignorance.  Most of us grow up at some point and realize that a) government is necessary in the world TODAY (maybe it won't be in 1000 years and then we can discuss getting rid of it and taxes), and b) governments cost money to operate.

That's home prices, again confusing value with purchasing power of a person.  Homes fluctuate in inherent value -- not just measured by dollars.  If you build a home and cities are built around it, it's inherent value increases.  Usually that's reflected by pricing, but pricing has a lot of other things influencing it as well -- namely the ability of people to come up with it.  So your example is hugely flawed and conveys a deep misunderstanding about currency.

That's great for people who don't need a lot of software.  For those who do need Windows software, the amount of time it takes to install the OS is really low on the list of priorities.  That's just settling for lazy security rather than proactive and getting everything you want.  Granted for a lot of power users, linux is the more powerful OS and that's great for them.  But if I hadn't learned the basics of security, I'd probably end up getting viruses no matter what OS I used. 
OS choice always boils down to what do *you* need out of your OS and what's the cost/benefit analysis of sticking with the chosen OS vs. going with a new one, short-term and long-term.  For me I need a lot of software that isn't on Linux and whose "alternatives" would take too much time to learn (Photoshop for example).

I will start spending my bitcoins when I can be paid in bitcoin, and when I actually want to be paid in bitcoin.  For that to happen, bitcoin needs to mature a bit.
 Right now, it makes no sense for me to pay a fee to convert my USD to bitcoin and then go and spend it right away, UNLESS merchant is offering a discount of greater than the fee I've paid and the cost of the time it's taken me to do all of that.

If you found a million dollars lying on the sidewalk, wouldn't you want to put it somewhere safe until you could figure out how to get it back to the owner?  
It's the same reason you should keep BTC in cold storage and not in an online account.  To do otherwise is risky.  Twice as risky if you can't afford to lose what you were just accidentally given and charged for.

@_date: 2014-11-12 04:15:34
If bitcoin is truly valuable, then alt-coins, by the nature of a free market, necessarily come in to compete for its marketshare, diminishing its value.  In other words, the value of bitcoin is dependent on scarcity, except there is no scarcity if the technology can be replicated, meaning there is no finite # of bitcoins, meaning there is not much value at all.
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:29:48
That's because you're a bitcoin evangelist though.  Nobody else would do that.  Everyone else has fiat, why the hell would they buy bitcoin, it's an extra step in the middle with huge risk, overhead, etc..  
This whole notion is clearly designed to rope more people into buying bitcoin, not because it adds any real value to the consumer. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 17:20:09
No, just no.  You keep repeating this.  It's not the same.  
The time it would be the same:  if a Satoshi was worth $100 and we needed to split it so someone could buy a Satoshi for $50 or whatever.   A stock splits because you can't buy half a share, or 1/100th of a share.  You can only buy a whole share.

It would not take long to start identifying addresses and targeting big holders in robberies, blackmaling, threats, etc..  Unlike cash, which you'd have to get to a bank to rob, you can easily go to someone's house and hold a gun to their head and say "I know you have 100BTC, and you're going to give them to me right now." and leave the scene of the crime without a trace.  
Privacy is not just a nice thing to have in bitcoin, it's going to be a necessity for businesses to adopt it, for one, and a necessity for widespread consumer adoption as well.  Nobody wants their financial business being made public for the entire world to see.

Sorry but who is "we"?  Am I on trial?  No, I'm not.   My lawyer has advised me exactly NOT to take private emails which happen between me and them and post them publicly, as it complicates things significantly, so I can't.  When this is all over I will be happy to though, I promise.   Talking about the issue *without* details such as the names of who I've been corresponding with is OK.  
If it doesn't add up, then you have to be suggesting there is some ulterior motive here.  If I'm saying I don't want help on reddit, what are you suggesting the motive is exactly?  I mean I know everyone here is more suspicious than a meth head that's been up for 3 days, but couldn't it be that I'm just not that interested in trying to convince everybody of something if they're acting like I'm on trial and need every bit of evidence, regardless of the consequences doing that have on me?  It's actually a lot simpler than you're making it out to be.  Fact of the matter is Coinbase will not admit how badly they screwed up because it does them extreme damage to do so.  That's something you can ascertain without evidence.  As for me, I'm trying to help others, not myself here.

Logically speaking, no.  You'd need to look at why they failed, the historical circumstances around it, and compare the contexts to then and now, upon which you'll find they share more fundamental differences than similarities.  Since the current US economy is not going to be sufficiently similar to any of those economies of the past, the conclusion you're drawing is flawed.

It seems clear there are a lot of young people in this subreddit.  Please give my opinion some consideration before downvoting just because you disagree. 
I do not believe that unbridled access to a black market that puts people at risk, where there is no accountability to anyone or anything, is something we should stand up for;  it *is* something we can learn from. My stance on the drug war is different -- I believe people should be allowed to make decisions for themselves, but they should equally be able to have access to quality medicines that pass some bare minimum safety measures, as well as have access to adequate resources for information and addiction treatment. Without the latter, the former is hugely problematic.
The Silk Road is a bad side effect of the war on drugs -- it is like cars without seatbelts and if the engine blows up and kills you, nobody is accountable. This is not something to be proud of. Ross is not a hero, he was a brave cyber criminal that we should not forget did not have to look any of his customers in the eye and see what effect the Silk Road might have had on their lives collectively. If he did have that opportunity, and continued to do business anyway, it would be a different story. Bottom line is he was just interested in making money under the premise that rather than try to change the laws he would simply break them and capitalize on it, knowing full well the risk of spending the rest of his life behind prison. He made that choice, and if he is going to preach about personal freedoms and having self-responsibility, then he must certainly take responsibility for his own actions.

1) Condescending remarks don't help your point.  (So much for dogecoiners being the antidote to the high-and-mighty bitcoiners, eh?)
2) Bitcoin has limited and predictable inflation, it is controlled.  When you introduce altcoins which are all competing for another scarcity (people's money), there is no longer a limit to the inflation.  It is limitless inflation, and this is the problem.

In case you missed it, this was a tongue in cheek reference to Mt. Gox holding people's money hostage, where people are very much relying on an exchange.  
The only way you could avoid relying on an exchange is by face-to-face cash trades or mining.  At some point your money is being handed to someone else and you're trusting them to give you coins for it.  Is that not reliance?
Anyway, I get what the guy is saying, it was just meant to be a poke, because we are definitely not there yet, and to be blind and arrogant to that would only serve to bring us more Mt. Goxes.

Cryptocurrency value comes from digital scarcity. If you keep making new coins, and you keep adding more money, there is no scarcity, and there is no value to ANY of it. Everyone loses in a situation of LIMITLESS INFLATION. Listen to the true experts (not the know-it-alls on reddit) and you will not hear any of them suggesting altcoins without a pegged price to btc (i.e. if btc goes up the altcoin goes up, no matter what) is a good for cryptocurrency in the long wrong.

I don't see how you can say that.  That's your fantasy, there is no real proof to back up those claims.  For all we know net violence increased due to some unpredictable shift in drug war dynamics.

This idea that it reduced violence is a complete myth until there is sound evidence to back it up.

Beyond that, the exchange itself should not even be able to touch those funds at all.  They should essentially be locked, only moveable with a key from the exchange and a key from the customer.  This would prevent an exchange from stealing its customers funds and claiming it got hacked.

I don't know what to say -- you're just wrong to say that the whole community was telling people not to use Gox.  In fact, I often told people not to use Gox and felt very much like I was in the minority.  Frankly it amazes me how much people have twisted this part of the story.  The whole community was NOT raising red flags.  A sizable but NONETHELESS A MINORITY part of the community was (while the rest ignored it or actively argued in protest).
But that's actually besides the point.  The point was that a reasonable person might ask "How did you twist your ankle?" and rightfully feel mad if someone was negligent and did not fix the stairwell that broke beneath your feet.  But actually, it goes further than that, because not only was the owner negligent, but someone was stealing the wood from the stairs, too, weakening the support, which did inf act contribute to your twisting your ankle.  But it's totally your fault and we won't say anything about the thieves.... we'll blame the lack of upkeep and you for not paying enough attention to reddit before you make all of your decisions. /s

I could give you some ways it adds value to the consumer:  microtransactions.  Think tipping, for all kinds of things.  But like you say, it's a different set of opportunities.  And to be clear, this discussion is about Amazon.  Unless Amazon starts needing microtransactions, it has no reason to accept bicoin.  It's not Overstock, a waning company in need of radical ideas to save itself, nor in need free publicity through an internet hipster fad.

I will happily return the 20 BTC once the charges to my credit card are reversed but I'm not going to resolve this via reddit -- that was not the point of this post, I already *tried* to resolve it with your support team.  If you're saying there is more I can do, I'm open to hearing it, please pm me.

Privacy will not come in the form of tumblers.  It will be baked into the protocol at some point.  No information will really be discernable from the blockchain.
This is necessary because how else can businesses do business with each other without privacy?  It would be very easy to see what kind of deals Company A is giving Company B behind Company C's back if they could trace the money.
This is bad for business and therefore bad for bitcoin.
Nobody would accept having their credit card bills posted in public.  This is also bad for business and therefore bad for bitcoin.
Privacy isn't a nice-to-have, it's a must-have for bitcoin to even gain widespread adoption.

So why are people buying bitcoin?  What is the value that it adds?  I'm doing research right now, on the front lines.  You seem to believe it is better than a credit card, I'm honestly asking why?  Give me specifics.  Software to software payments?  Like how banks transfer money already?  You know it's all digital... that's already solved.  I can see why corporations might like bitcoin, though, it holds huge potential for contracts and serving as a public ledger, but as a consumer commodity I see no value being added.  I'm openly admitting I might be missing the value for the consumer here, so that's why I'm asking you, but I'm getting the sense there really is none.

It's a nice thought but clearly you don't understand that Amazon is not a vending machine and that there are larger issues at play than credit card fees, namely user support, marketing, customer retention, customer opinion, and so on.  Amazon simply would not benefit from bitcoin right now and it would hurt its image not help it, this is a tired argument.  Step outside the bitcoin bubble and ask the rest of the world who doesn't give a shit about bitcoin what they think about bitcoin and that's the majority of Amazon's customers, you can deny that all you want and wish it was different but that's the reality right now.  Why would you want to add something that seems shady to most people?  That makes Amazon look bad. Maybe in 5 years when bitcoin matures.

Cryptocurrency value comes from digital scarcity. If you keep making new coins, and you keep adding more money, there is no scarcity, and there is no value to ANY of it. Everyone loses in a situation of LIMITLESS INFLATION. Listen to the true experts (not the know-it-alls on reddit) and you will not hear any of them suggesting altcoins without a pegged price to btc (i.e. if btc goes up the altcoin goes up, no matter what) is a good for cryptocurrency in the long wrong.

**Here is how you should return bitcoins that ended up in your wallet.**
You send a tiny amount back to the address (like .0001 btc), with a message attached.  You can assume the guy will figure out the mistake and start looking at the blockchain and addresses for some hope.  Send a message like this so as to not attract fraud:
".45 -- oops? contact me bob Get in touch with the person, and figure it out from there.   You need to get proof of ownership of the address primarily.
You have to ASSUME that if you tried to send it back to that address, they would not receive it, because for example my exchange withdrawals come from shared addresses that are different than deposit addresses.  In that case the money may be lost forever so hold onto it for right now.
And if you get the .0001btc back, it's safe to assume it's a shared address with an auto-refund feature that rejects deposits (a stupid feature, really, because if it happened that the sending address also employed this it just ping-pongs back and forth till tx fees eat away the entire balance -- but I digress).

$11 billion, but how much is being spent on consumer goods?  I would guess less than .1%.  Couple that with the fact that all of those people spending bitcoins can still spend USD at Amazon, so Amazon is not missing out on a market until millions of people boycott the USD.  There is little upside for Amazon, but big potential downside: if bitcoin fails, a major exchange is hacked, 51% attack occurs, any kind of wild price swings downard, it makes Amazon seem like amateurs and consumers will not appreciate their tacit endorsement of an alpha stage technology.
I say it could happen some day but to think it will happen this year is ignorant of how important Amazon regards its reputation and how little a role bitcoin actually plays in the economy at this time.  People are getting way ahead of themselves here.  Let's fix the problems first.  Any problems with bitcoin would be problems for Amazon, and since bitcoin is out of their control, it's all risk for little if any reward.

They fed me the same BS line when **their** system had a bug that caused an unauthorized charge on my account.
They also failed for over 2 months to stop sending me SMS text messages for 2FA, which *is* a potential security risk if your SMS could be sniffed.   For whatever reason I couldn't disable the SMS messages no matter what we tried.  It took them weeks to respond and they never ended up fixing it. I ended up having to escalate the issue to Authy, the SMS service provider, to essentially blacklist my # to get it to stop (the Authy CEO apologized for the issue and told me to personally contact him if I had any more messages).
If CB support tries to come onto this thread and offer to "help", while that may sound nice, it's to save face primarily since you already went through the support ticket motions - so just ask them to e-mail you if they want to help; it's the only official communication channel they provide and it's important to use that in case you ever need to make a legal claim.

It's the kind of thing where if you have bitcoins, then it'd be nice to spend them like cash, rather than having to exchange them.  But if you don't, then you'll probably just use your credit/debit card per usual. 
First we need to get the security issues of bitcoin wallets nailed down -- after that, we can lobby merchants to start offering discounts for purchases made with bitcoin.  This would drive adoption, but it'd be premature at this point because a lot of people would lose their coins to malware/theft before they got to spend a single one.  We're still in the early adopter phase believe it or not, even if Overstock accepts bitcoin.

Hard innovation typically occurs where it's profitable and right now the future of bitcoin is iffy.  Think about the Internet -- at first there were only a few services making great use of it, with plenty more seeing its potential but not bothering to get involved.  It took about 10 years for the dot-com bubble (and even though it was a bubble that popped, a lot of innovation began during that time).  So it could take 10 years before anything substantial happens with bitcoin, too.  I would cut it in half and say 5 years since the Internet accelerates sharing of knowledge and work.

This may be a case of mixed ethical decision making.  On one hand it's perfectly reasonable for them to want to keep an eye on things and make sure there are no crazy unintended consequences of opening the flood gates.  On the other hand, this also is a convenient way for them to encourage whales to stick around and trade a bit more.  Trading is what keeps them in business afterall.  
However, one thing to keep in mind they are still under investigation regarding their non-FinCEN compliance from many months ago and may be doing so to make sure they are covering their asses in whatever non-public regards their lawyers have imposed on them.  Nobody has a clue as to what they're dealing with in that regard but I'd imagine it involves extreme scrutiny of any/all transactions, btc or fiat.

This is a major flaw in the media actually, less so with bitcoin. They can pretty much ruin our lives because "if it bleeds it leads" as they say in the industry.  The mainstream media companies' power is greater than anything the bitcoin network can offer the world right now by a looooong shot.  Bitcoin's greatest strength against the media, honestly, is that Satoshi Nakamoto is anonymous and they can't attack his personal life or place him into a political bucket so that he can be mindlessly hated by some third of the US.  If it weren't for that, bitcoin never would have gotten any positive media coverage at all I think.
Also consider that bitcoin may fail for the rich nations but not for the poor ones.

I think this is the foggy future people can't see right now, but I believe will clear up soon.  The market should come up with ways to make buying/spending bitcoins more attractive.  It's not just making it easier and more secure, it's providing incentives for the consumer to choose bitcoin over USD.  It's up to the market to leverage what bitcoin can offer to build services and markets around those features.  
We could wait around for the USD to fail but it's looking like a long and slow death that could take years / decades.  I think what we'll see instead is a market being built around bitcoin that figures out how to drive adoption with more than just philanthropy and trendiness.

The analogy is kind of like the US saying you can no longer text "SAVE THE TURTLES" to 31337 to make a donation to some organization and have your phone company bill you for it.  In China, they don't want you to pay using a new method (scan a QR code) -- they don't want telecom companies providing financial services is my take on it.  You're just going to have to pay using the methods they can watch and control, like your good old state-owned China UnionPay credit card.
Honestly, I don't see how this affects bitcoin or bitcoin exchanges in any way, this is just general consumer finance policy news, but perhaps it just reiterates the point that the PBOC's policies aren't changing, not that we expect them to any time soon.

If you're going to host people's wallets then you need to ensure uptime of 99.99% like any other hosting service is expected to give customers these days.
After using your service twice in the past 2 months and both times having my transactions go unconfirmed for hours, with no reason, and after claiming here on reddit the issue was fixed (but in fine print it read: mostly fixed, but not for everyone, which I read as face-saving bullshit), this is the last straw.

A better question to ask is would you dedicate your work life to bitcoin?
Putting your life savings, if you are lucky enough to have been taught the importance of saving and actually have some savings, into bitcoin is reckless, no matter how revolutionary bitcoin may be -- it's price does not reflect its potential to change the world, it reflects its supply and demand.  Just keep that in mind.  
At this point NOBODY knows what its value will be too far into the future.  Instead of putting all your life savings into bitcoin, if you're really a believer, consider finding work in the bitcoin economy, putting all your ENERGY, not your finances, towards the bitcoin infrastructure.  This is the better risk to take because even if bitcoin fails, you will never lose the skills, wisdom, and experiences you've gained.  Your savings, however, could disappear in a heartbeat.  
Undoubtedly, USD, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and even assets like property can carry some risk too.  We saw that in 2008.   But diversifying is the key to a high probability of financial security.  There are lots of people who will tell you how much they made going all in on this or that, but it'd be wise to remember that few will care to admit their losses due to embarrassment, humility, shame, and feeling like a complete idiot.

One thing to keep in mind is that their decisions may be influenced by legal matters that the public is not knowledgeable about.  They are still under investigation regarding their FinCEN non-compliance from many months ago and may be doing so to make sure they are covering their asses in whatever non-public regards their lawyers have imposed on them. Nobody has a clue as to what they're dealing with in that regard but I'd imagine it involves extreme scrutiny of any/all transactions, btc or fiat.
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:15:00
massive usage is only helpful under the right conditions.  to be clear, it's not what makes things stable.  for example, if one person owned 99.9999% of bitcoins, and a billion people owned the rest, that's massive usage, but it's nothing close to being stable.  only with very specific distribution of wealth, not equal distribution but at least balanced in some way, in proportion to all parties, would massive usage lead to stability, and that's far from the case.   and if you argue that massive usage will lead to better distribution, well I'd say that's a bit like the cart pulling the horse if stability is needed for mass adoption.

Um, no, that's *exactly* how supply and demand works.  If there is infinite supply, there is no trade value.  Bitcoin's value is dependent on **scarcity** and the network behind it.  If an alt-coin can develop a strong enough network it will have value that is more realistic, as it won't be hyper-inflated by the same speculation currently pumped into bitcoin. Thus I'd argue that, by way of analysis of litecoin as a derivation of the same technology, with for all intents and purposes equal features, the value of bitcoin is probably around $10.

Bitcoin as a currency will likely fail because it basically requires a complete redistribution of wealth but doesn't necessarily come with a complete social upheaval / revolution / overthrow that would typically accompany and legitimize a redistribution of wealth.  And when I say revolution, I mean like the fall of the Soviety Union, not iPods.
The exception to this is that the economy transforms in ways we can't imagine and wealth begins to be distributed similarly -- in new ways we can't imagine.  Like if the number of red blood cells in your body somehow determined how many stars in the sky you were allowed to own -- it makes no sense in current times but maybe it would in the future.  Maybe people don't accumulate wealth through traditional labor markets anymore in the future, maybe it's something entirely different.  This may seem like a stretch in our lifetime, and I think it is too.

Anyone else feel like the entire first part of this was written by a different person?  The part about bitcoin seems to be way less mature in terms of its ideology.  I'm not saying it is two different authors, just that there isn't much congruency between the topics.  The stuff on economics is interesting and established, but the stuff on bitcoin makes it seem like transaction malleability as if this is a big issue in terms of the economics of bitcoin?  It will be forgotten in 6 months.  So I'm confused about that..  It doesn't mention the real problems bitcoin has, which is its dependence on the real economy -- which encompasses all of the problems of the world, in a nutshell.  Yes, the ideal is bitcoin breaks away from the economy, and maybe it will in some parts of the world, and maybe I'm depressed because I live in America and we resist progressive movements like a banker resists charity.
Yes, bitcoin depends on the economy which depends on fiat right now.  If WWIII began and global wars became really bad, if economic collapse follows, it immediately becomes a goods/services barter economy:  food, real assets, energy, and weapons (or protection, and other forms of power) would be what would be sought after.  Nobody would think much about bitcoins unless things stabilized some years/decades later (if ever).   If the global economy collapses, a whole slew of problems from many angles get introduced that creates a mess too big to deal with using bitcoin.  Just one example: a vast majority of miners might get cut off from electricity to mine, the Internet would become disjointed and eventually dissolve into smaller localized mesh networks, and bitcoin itself would have no centralized community -- it might fork into a million altcoins without any real democracy because people would be facing more pressing challenges like finding food or protecting themselves.
This is why I like to say the future of blockchain technology is bright -- it is a revolutionary technological innovation -- but Bitcoin's is hazy.  I'm also pessimistic about the future of this planet and I think they go hand in hand.  I like to say that if you believe bitcoin will succeed, you're betting first on humans, second on the brilliant logic of the code, necessarily in this order.

@_date: 2014-11-23 21:43:06
But e-mail still delivered something that the average joe could see as useful at least, even though nobody used it yet.  Is bitcoin really offering something that isn't offered by other technologies?  Perhaps if you want to send money around the world, bitcoin has a great value proposition (assuming stable prices which is not a good assumption at all).  But beyond that, there is nothing the average joe would see in bitcoin and go ahhhh I wish that I could do this with dollars.  He can already spend his money using NFC, digital wallets, heck even credit cards have fraud protection which bitcoin doesn't.  What happens if you want to return a purchase within 90 days per some merchant's return policy but they refuse to pay you because they're a deadbeat business?  You have no recourse.  Average joe will quickly come back to credit cards once he is burned by something like that.

But in email your support team is saying, in fact, **I can't return them**.  In other words, you're charging me for the BTC you put in my account, and you're pocketing the fees for that exchange too.   I find it hilarious Coinbase thinks it can actually get away with this.


These are empty words clearly.  Nothing has been fixed and I've gotten no indication that Coinbase actually will do anything except wait for my credit card company to chargeback this fraudulent transaction made by Coinbase.

I just pointed out the problem, I did not suggest that it is solvable.  You said yourself, "Shouldn't we be honest about it?"  Well, yes.  And I think I am being honest about it.  So, no, obviously you cannot stop printing presses.  I guess it probably makes you uncomfortable that I highlighted something that doesn't have a simple answer.  Maybe it sounds a little FUD-sy.  We'd like the problems of bitcoin to be simple but bschott007's point, and my agreement, is that the problems are bigger than bitcoin.
This is a cultural problem -- and media corporation conglomeration hurts much more than just bitcoin, btw.  Control the media, control the minds.

Cryptocurrency value comes from digital scarcity. If you keep making new coins, and you keep adding more money, there is no scarcity, and there is no value to ANY of it. Everyone loses in a situation of LIMITLESS INFLATION.  Listen to the true experts (not the know-it-alls on reddit) and you will not hear any of them suggesting altcoins without a pegged price to btc (i.e. if btc goes up the altcoin goes up, no matter what) is a good for cryptocurrency in the long wrong.

It's hard to say if it's legal though.  For example, it could be used as leading evidence to another crime.  Perhaps not insider trading.  But if there was another scandal that took place and this was a piece of that puzzle.  
Regardless, I get your point, but actions aren't contained in a bubble.  If it was the CEO of one of these companies that sold off their shares, even if it's not illegal, we deserve to know why they were in the loop and not everyone else, so that we can be sure there is not some criminality involved here.   I do not eliminate the possibility that Mt. Gox was sabotaged -- a bug that was perhaps found but left unfixed, and tipped off to a very wealthy friend, for example.

OK, then we're in agreement on the first part.  Regarding the second, if someone with a disproportionate number of bitcoins as compared to the whole system sells his coins tomorrow, or better yet gives them away, everyone holding bitcoin would be fucked because they would see their net worth drop overnight.   Nobody else gets to decide on that, they don't even have a voice.  So it's while the protocol may be democratic, the value aspect is not.  In this regard, it's exactly the same as the current banking system, except far more risky, and because it is global, shadowy and without rule of law (no sense of consequences for fucking the system).

He's a CEO, it's his job to do and say things in the interest of his company.  In this case, acting like they are ahead of the curve makes it seem like Overstock can be compared to Amazon -- it can't, but saying things like this will make it seem like it can for consumers and that's good for his company.
He is an excellent CEO, seems like a cool guy too.  I'm a fan.  But I don't forget that CEOs never stop working.  They don't say things off the cuff without knowing how it affects their business.  In this case, he is making smart moves in a big game of chess.

Copy, no, but compete, absolutely.  Because the value in bitcoin is not tied to any single use, it has multiple uses, and the technology that supports those uses *can* be copied to enough of a degree that the uses can be had for less investment, with acceptable risk, outside the scarcity of bitcoin, which is what diminishes its value.  
The point is, the value proposition I often see being made has this gaping fallacy in that it assumes there are no other crypto-currencies now or ever.

Encouraging users to make use of the integrated encryption (like Bitlocker) is the part of this that strikes me as really weird.  This is either a hack or a canary attempt -- i.e. they can say the software is insecure, but not why, and the encouraging to use Windows built in encryption seems strange enough to question what's going on behind the scenes.

Fair enough but Overstock isn't Amazon, even if they sell a lot of the same crap.  They have an entirely different market, different customers, and different business goals and measures of success, as well as risk appreciations.
As a side note, I actually was going to buy a watch off Overstock.com to support their pro-BTC stance.   It was listed as being [on sale at $189.99](  Then I found the same watch on Amazon, which listed its [MSRP at $135 and on sale for $76](  Needless to say Overstock.com didn't get the sale (and neither did Amazon.)

Nobody is blaming bitcoin for what happened at Mt. Gox.  However, to say that what happened at Mt. Gox does not AFFECT bitcoin is just dumb.  One can tout how the protocol is still safe all they want, but it doesn't mean that people aren't affected.  At the end of the day, bitcoin's utility *for* people like yourself depends on all those other people who were affected by Mt Gox (those who had money on Gox, and those who maybe never bought a bitcoin but won't now after hearing about this) wanting to continue using it.

That's not how it works.  They aren't waiting for 20 BTC -- I know this because I've had more than 20 BTC in my account on plenty of occasions since then.  Their charge balanced the books so in their eyes it's settled until the chargeback comes I guess.  
Besides, they charged me for something I didn't buy.  I didn't steal them, I've already said when they tell me how to give them back I'm ready to do so.  But again, it's like a merchant sending you a pair of jeans you didn't order.  You owe them the jeans, but you definitely do not owe them any money until you've at least refused to give them the jeans back! This isn't my opinion, this is the law.

Right, so 1 share is split into 2, and you can't buy less than 1 share ever. If the share costs $500, you can't buy $250 worth. If you want to make the share buyable at $250, you'd split it.
Good news, that's not true with bitcoin. If a bitcoin costs $600, you can buy $300 worth, you can buy $100 worth, you can buy $10 worth, and you can buy 50 cents worth. Nothing needs to change for that, so it's nothing like a stock split at all.
Stocks don't split to give the impression that smaller amounts can be bought.  They split SO THAT smaller amounts can be bought.

NO.  Here is the timeline of events as far as I can recall and from what I have in my account history (which I'm hesitant to trust but it seems to line up from my memory, this was over 2 months ago mind you) 
Day 1 : try to sell 20 BTC, order goes into Pending Status.
Day 2: credited 20 BTC in the same order details, but 20 BTC Sell is still in Pending Status.  
Day 3: Nothing, 20 BTC still in account.
Day 4: Nothing, 20 BTC still in account.  Now my bank account gets charged but didn't have funds so it declined.  This is when I became aware that something had really gone wrong.  The order was still in Pending status so I waited.
Day 5: Nothing, 20 BTC still in account.
Day 6: the 20 BTC Debit and USD deposit from the 20 BTC I tried to sell at this point goes from Pending to 'Cancelled' and the USD does not appear in my bank account as it was supposed to.  I put in an order to sell 20 BTC again.
Day 7:  my credit card is charged, I open Support ticket.

Not sure why the downvotes.  It's true. Amazon is a business.  As a business, accepting bitcoin would be akin to endorsing bitcoin.  Overstock can do this because it's a hole in the wall compared to Amazon and they can afford to take risks, they don't have a reputation like Amazon does to begin with, and they could use any trend to their advantage.
Bitcoin is not ready for an endorsement from Amazon.  
How about we figure out how to make bitcoins secure in our wallets first, easier than cash/credit cards to spend, then worry about Amazon.

Slightly different case here though.  Coinbase might have tried to debit my account 20 BTC automatically (which would have been fine since I could have done my own accounting to see what happened).  But they instead charged me for what they gave me.   This is like an eBay seller accidentally sending you a free pair of jeans, then later charging you for those jeans and calling it a day.  Not asking for the jeans back, just automatically charging you for them.  Maybe that seems like a fair deal to them, but I wound up with a pair of jeans I didn't want.  Now the seller won't accept the jeans in return unless I initiate a chargeback.  I would guess they're hoping I won't bother since it's a hassle.

Honestly, does the average person understand how a magnetic strip on a credit card works?  Sure, they understand how to swipe it.  But do they have even the faintest clue about how it works?  No.  It's essentially magic.
Similarly, I don't expect bitcoin to ever be understood by the masses.  There simply aren't many reasons for the average person to even need to understand it.  You can use bitcoin without understanding how it works, so the only motive would be interest. 
 The important thing is that it's stable and secure (including the services that support it).

If you bet it will go up and have capital to push it up, you'd better hope there aren't holders betting it will go down with enough bitcoin to cause a sell off.  Best theory on the current bull run is investors looking to bet against it via futures will use their millions in accumulated btc to cause a selloff.

Coinbase back then had a lot of fucked up accounting issues.  There were multiple bugs in their system that screwed things up for people's accounts -- things like duplicated orders that weren't real (e.g. purchase 1BTC, account record showed purchase for 2BTC and payment for 20 BTC but balance only show 1BTC and you only paid for 1BTC, stuff like that).  One valid fear is that they hand data over to the IRS and that data is assumed to be valid but actually isn't.

I'm not an economist but I am a philosopher and I recognize that what it sounds like you're wanting is a fair balance.  So we can agree there.  It's where you start to suggest a certain type of transaction is "spam" or should be discouraged that I think we should take issue with.  Perhaps this is rubbing up against my net neutrality values.  I disagree that every transaction should require a fee.  
For example, e-mail does not require stamps because service providers have figured out how to provide it for free (and email has gotten BETTER consistently, not worse).  Does free e-mail lead to more spam?  Yes.  But we've developed pretty good spam filters to help deal with 99% of it and spam has pretty much become a minor issue compared to what it once was.  I remember when certain people suggested requiring "e-stamps" as a way to combat this problem, which seems ridiculous in retrospect.   Do spammers pay for e-mail lists that they can spam as well (e.g. paying a "transaction fee" in effect)?  You bet.  Most importantly, has free e-mail caused more good than harm?  A reasonable person would say absolutely it has, by a long shot.  
And today, free electronic communication (aside from the electricity cost and the devices used to send/receive) is the standard by which society operates and which works best on.  We did not make spam "costly", we made it profit-less (some see this as the same thing but these things are relative and not fixed to one another).  We *en*couraged free e-mail adoption to bring markets to deal with the problems it presented, rather than discouraged the free nature of it, in effect.
The model is not broke with free transactions, **it's optimal**, IMHO!   There is a spot for just about everyone at this table and that's what will drive the success of the currency in the long run (I'm sure we might agree here).

I don't think you understood the problem.  So you have a Gmail account, your name on Gmail is John Doe.  Localbitcoins notifies you of contacts on localbitcoins, to which you can reply from your email, but this isn't replying directly to the the contacts, it's replying to a localbitcoins reply address, which inserts the message onto their system.  localbitcoins hides your email from the recipient.  if you reply it will say Message from: [email hidden] , hiding your contact info.  Now it says Message from: John Doe [email hidden].  So it's leaking your email name. The intent of the feature is to protect your email information from being leaked and as such is broken.  It's either a bug or they screwed up big time.

Great read, glad they didn't dumb it down to an excruciating degree.  Is this essentially a tragedy of the commons problem?  I think what we have to look out for is ignorance rather than greed.

Well, you start off talking about subsidization and then you go on to talk about attack surfaces.  So first of all, I don't believe DoS to be so highly correlated to free transactions.  If it were, why don't we have a failed network already?  Also, even with fees you can get excessive transactions that could be seen as a DoS (e.g. SatoshiDice) which makes the point moot in my opinion.  Someone with a lot of money is not going to be discouraged by the tiny fees, even for millions of transactions, if their aim to really cause harm.  Think of governments who might wish to implement such an attack -- cost is hardly an issue.
Secondly, I believe parts of the network, not the entire network, should be able to choose if they'd like to "subsidize" the free transactions, which judging by present conditions most will not anyway, meaning the attack surface is going to be minimal.  Perhaps nodes should be able to decide, in binary fashion per client, whether to propagate free transactions or not as a part of the protocol?


Yes I understand that email does not propagate to every inbox in existence and it's not an apt metaphor in that way.  However, looking at the number of transactions on the BTC network, and looking ahead at potential transactions (we could use credit card transactions per minute perhaps as the bare minimum baseline) we can calculate the cost.  Networks aren't the issue, disks are.  So with that, I believe the way to deal with a growing database is NOT forcing transactions to be taxed, since 99.9999% of the nodes aren't benefiting directly from the fees anyway so their disk cost increases regardless; also, the transactions are already incredibly compressed and efficient in terms of data size so further compression is just a cost in a different form (computation rather than disk space) which requires more power and is worse for the network;  rather the solution is simply let the demand for disk space drive the innovation of storage technology -- something we can count on to continue for a long time to come.

I seriously doubt they would just threaten to put businesses in a high risk pool with added fees without some kind of study and evidence proving that businesses who accept bitcoin have suffered financial problems that have made them risky to work with.  Otherwise they are actually discriminating against businesses illegally and in a anti-competitive fashion.  Antitrust suits would quickly follow and they would lose.  Visa/Mastercard would probably do something a bit smarter than this, although I wouldn't put it past PayPal since they literally are the monopoly on internet payments and seem to have no problem with acting above the law, freezing peoples accounts on a whim, etc..

Again... if their negligence caused them to go bankrupt, and that was why they couldn't pay me, that's a limited liability situation.

If we're going to play word games, let's get busy.  What you're actually saying is you're not interested in ENCOURAGING anything, rather you're interested in DISCOURAGING certain transactions.  That distinction may seem minor but it's important.  Encouraging something allows what you might wish to discourage to exist freely, while the act of discouraging something is prohibitive and discriminatory.  
Now I can understand not responding to a DDoS attack kindly, for example, where the intent is to disrupt the system, but who are you to decide that small frequent gambling transactions should not be allowed on the network?   This is a moral judgement, is it not?   If not, then why should anyone be allowed to send small transactions?  They're all problematic, yes?  Or it's only certain services that we should discriminate against, is it?
This kind of policy ideology should offend anyone who sees the long term goal of the supporting network to be one lacking any real power (thanks to redundancy, efficiency, and ubiquity) to disturb the value of bitcoins.

They laid out the facts for people so that people could make informed decisions and be responsible for whatever outcomes those decisions entail.  I am not defending them just making sure others realize all the RBI basically said was "you're on your own, be careful." -- that is a part of bitcoin that we like, not despise, it's risky and that creates opportunity for not only criminals but for entrepreneurs  and innovators as well.

The solution to this is really simple but probably won't happen unless exchanges decide to take it into their own hands and advertise their methods of keeping customers information safe as a way of competing with other exchanges.
The solution is a system of applying irreversible specialized watermarks directly onto scanned images so they cannot be used anywhere except the originally intended exchange.  
*  Exchanges would have to verify the watermark and announce its hash publicly.  
*  The hash would include information that could be used to determine if any part of the image has been tampered.
If another exchange tries to use this image, it can be rejected publicly and the person can be notified automatically.  
*  It requires a special visual watermark that cannot be easily removed without evidence of tampering, as we should be trusting both an actual human at the exchange to verify the image, as well as a decentralized system.
*  The hash can be used to verify the integrity of the watermark, the human just manually confirms certain features of the image so that there can be some direct accountability -- a big part of AML regulatory policy and something customers should demand as well.  
*  The watermark should also include a way incorporating a hash of the data on the image itself (such as the name, address, etc.) so that the watermark is bound to the data.  
One could probably devise a cryptocurrency for this exact purpose, as the blockchain fills this type of role perfectly.  For example, if the image goes anywhere beyond the exchange's "wallet", it would need to be signed with a private key from the identified person -- this could be something as simple as their one-time-password.  
I think fractals might find an interesting application here on the visual watermark side, something that modifies every pixel of the image, with infinite repetition across all scales so that any tampering at all could be detected algorithmically. The fractal equation would be included in the final hashing algorithm to add integrity-checking.
Of course there could be many other ways to go about this, this idea is just off the top of my head.

it's hardly the first thing you do when you have a production-down issue... seriously.  you notify directly affected customers (which they did), not update the blog.  you try to fix the problem immediately.  if after a short period of time, THEN you go to twitter and give an update, and then you get right back to fixing it.  you don't go "oh that's funny... the site's down. let me log into reddit, twitter, facebook, google+, everywhere else where we have followers... oh the site's back up?  oh.  i guess i'll go back and remove all these updates.  oh it's back down again?  i guess i'll make another update....
that said, it IS frustrating that it's down.  but people clearly have no idea what a scramble issues like this can sometimes be in 24/7 uptime environments... you have no idea what the issue is even is.  maybe squirrels are chewing on wires.  maybe someone tripped in the data center and spilled coffee all over the servers.  or maybe someone wrote bad code and they can't figure out what's bad about it.  don't make assumptions.

Right now, perhaps so..  But this precludes a proposed new system.   Consider the fact that the only parts of the document that require authenticity right now is the information contained within it (e.g. your name, address, birthdate) and the loosely-verifiable authenticity of the document scanned (i.e., does it appear to be a real passport?).  Every other part of the image scanned is actually not being utilized.  
The solution is ironically tangible to Bitcoin's solution against counterfeiting / double-spending.  The only part that needs to be solved really is how do you give someone a secure way to authenticate their own images (secure meaning to make it difficult for another party to impersonate them), and how do you enable exchanges to validate that authenticity.

production down = money being lost.  every minute that ticks by could mean hundreds, thousands of dollars being lost.  usually the best use of time is NOT going to twitter and other social media outlets to try and update customers when you don't even know what the issue is yet.  the first thing you do is get a basic grasp of what's going on and decide if you think it's going to last more than say 5 seconds.  then you can decide to notify directly impacted customer (i.e. ones with recurring orders that won't go through -- which they did).  beyond that, you do not provide constant updates about your product-down issues unless you are paying someone to stand by and spend their time doing that, like the customer support director might.  during the middle of the night it'll probably be the dev team working on it, focusing on simply fixing the problem at hand (and these are assumptions about the nature of the problem).  again, every second wasted could means a lot of lost revenue.  yes there can be some deciding on whether frustration might lead to tertiary lost revenue too, but usually the direct impact holds a lot more weight, and right now coinbase is not in a heavily comptetitive market.

It's very difficult to buy/sell bitcoin at the moment, especially here in the US.  There is only one company so far in the US (Coinbase) and it's insufficient to meet market demand.  One of the reasons for this is that banks aren't getting clear enough guidance and are therefore stifling the potential startups.
Please do not let banks discriminate against what could be a competing platform to them.  It's very important to give David a fair shot against Goliath.  
The market is there but there aren't enough services to provide for it.  Let's ensure the startups do not go overseas during this crucial race to market as these companies could very well be the next Visa or Mastercard in a few years.

Ah, I see.  The problem still is trust.   You  could  say  your  money  was robbed.   They  could  have  someone  rob  it  and  claim  it was  your  fault,  malware or  something.  The easy  thing  for  companies  to have a 0 liability policy.  but this ends up hurting everyone.  what we need is a system that protects the user and the company.   mandatory two factor authentication for example.   this could potentially eliminate the vast majority of fraud cases.

Prove they didn't send it to themselves.

Bitcoins are  like the BBSes  of  the early 90s.   Most  people  can't  figure  it  out, too bad, nobody guarantees its easy nor  do  they  act  like  it.   You're  talking  to  geeks, hello?   You'd  probably  fail at a  lot  of  things geeks do.  The Internet  exploded  when services  like AOL  helped  it  along.   We are  not  there  yet,  sorry.  Your  voice is heard  though.

Are there any localbitcoins staff that frequent the subreddit and if so could someone ping them?

Don't forget to set up two factor authentication :)

 You  used  "the Feds"  which  is usually  an indicator of someone talking  out  their ass

 Did  you  know  you  can  also drive  cars OVER  the speed  limit?  Crazy!

Strange is putting it politely.

Pro or anti-regulation isn't really the main dichotomy.  This is kind of like the false dichotomy of Republican vs. Democrat when both parties do for the most part the exact same thing, just in different ways.  Regulation will have to happen at some point, it's not really a question.  For one because people will demand it just like they demand their money be insured by banks (although most take it for granted now, the demand still implicitly exists).   But for two because we actually don't want multi-national corporations laundering their money and evading taxes more than they already do.  Bitcoin could actually help stop that with smart regulation created transparently.  But you shouldn't go around saying "I'm pro regulation" because it gives people who wish to exploit regulation systems for their own ends political ammo.  Suddenly you're supporting the guy who wants to promote bad regulation that will disrupt bitcoin by saying you're "pro regulation".  Stick to the specifics and don't get too campy/political about it.

Congratulations and thank you :)

Bullshit.  Their job is to protect the USD.  But they probably realize that they can't make BTC go away so they're going to have to embrace it slowly and carefully instead.

Wrong.   Banks commit  fraud  and  get  bailed  out.  HSBC launders  billions  of  dollars  and gets a  fine  that pales  in comparison  to  the  profits.   You're  dreaming if  you  think  fraud  isn't  more lucrative than  honest  business...  that's  why  people  do  it!
