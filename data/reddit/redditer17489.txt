A messiah is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed, or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal, and if they can't stop you, then you become something else entirely.

There are many ways to contribute to bitcoin. Contributing code is obviously very important, but so are other things like building bitcoin services, on-boarding merchants, growing the community, attending meetups etc. If you want to see bitcoin grow, don't sit back and wait for others to make it happen. Make it happen yourself. The easiest way to predict the future, is to create it.

Proof of stake is indeed one way around this problem. Dash has a good implementation of this where miners get 45% of the block rewards, nodes get 45%, and the remaining 10% goes to devs/others. Ether is also moving in the direction of proof of stake, but i'm not sure how long it will take them to implement.

Agree that bitmain's dominance of mining is an issue. However, I don't think your proposed solution would fix the problem. If the PoW algo was switched, bitmain with all its money and expertise would just make new asics, and we'd have the same problem on the new algo.

This is most likely fake news. No source for the claim's made in the article. And the article claims the new CEO is someone named 'Wang'.
