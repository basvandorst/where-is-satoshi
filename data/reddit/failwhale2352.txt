DIVERSIFY YOUR WEALTH.  It makes no sense to have more than half your wealth in one asset, however much you believe in it.
Investing 101:  Diversification is the only "free lunch."  Sell half your bitcoins.  Put 10% of what you get back in gold, leave 15% in cash, put 50% in VT (a low-fee global stock ETF), and 25% in VCLT (low-fee corporate bond ETF).  r/stewymills

The falls and rises you're talking about are trivial.  Bitcoin has had much bigger price moves in individual days without any news at all.  And why on earth would you buy at $380?  Why not load up at $340 where it was just a little earlier.  Or when it was $250?

Almost all of the "booming" things you list were true 2 years ago.  The market cap remains less than half of what it was at its peak.  Things look somewhat stagnant. r/handofbitcoin
Also, to most people, bitcoin hasn't yet "survived" the current crisis.  To some, they fear an "attack" from people looking to hard fork, while others fear that bitcoin has become mostly centralized and is controlled by a half dozen people.  At the very least, we need to have a scaling solution rolled out before we can say we're even a tiny bit past the current crisis.
@_date: 2016-04-14 04:27:29
I think you've got it reversed.  Satoshi explicitly talked about on-chain scaling.  Adam Back (who stated publicly that he thought bitcoin would go nowhere until he changed his mind in late 2013) disagreed with Satoshi's vision and is now slowing on-chain scaling with the intention that LN will take its place.

I mostly agree, but you're not quite right.  Consider that the Mt. Gox coins haven't been found.  
Combine multiple VPNs with correct TOR usage and you're probably untraceable.  
More importantly, there are different shades of anonymity.  The risk of going to jail if you buy something illicit with bitcoin over TOR is a lot lower than if you buy it with your credit card or in person with cash.  So people are more likely to buy illicit stuff with bitcoin as an option.

Your explanation is obsolete by a decade.  The central banks of the world simply prop up fixed income markets now.  It's not a lie - they are the market.

Why not?  It's really simple.  The buyers want to buy anonymously from other anonymous people.  Cash requires an in-person meeting, that both buyer and seller show up to get nabbed by an FBI sting.  In contrast, people can use bitcoin via TOR completely anonymously if done right.
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:28:37
If people are submitting transactions with high fees as an attack on the network, than that is an "attack on the network", but the individual transaction isn't spam.  The only definition we have for spam is very low-fee.  The whole point of bitcoin is that we don't know the purpose of 99% of transactions.

You're making a simple mistake - that punitive measure hurts *all* current miners, not just censoring miners.  It's useless as a signal to future miners as well, since it tells even all "good" miners not to invest in hardware or they may again be hurt along with the bad miners in the future.

A good rule of thumb is to do the opposite of whatever Zerohedge suggests.  Those guys have been consistently wrong about everything for the last decade.
@_date: 2016-05-23 23:35:48
This is incorrect.  In the past, the bitcoin price was rising exponentially, which supported greater investment in mining.  With bitcoin price in a bear market for the last 2.5 years, a reduction in payout directly reduces the monetary incentive to invest in hardware.  Miners are basically rational.  If the payout is half (not just payout in bitcoins, but after adjusting for the bitcoin to fiat exchange rate), to continue making money their cost per block needs to fall by roughly half.

Devs have refused to comment on the roundtable consensus timeline and refuse to confirm that a 2 MB HF is still planned for mid 2017.

When blocks far from full, confirmation times are perfectly *probabilistically predictable.*  We can calculate the exact odds of a 8 minute confirmation time, versus a 15 minute confirmation time etc.  The odds of a 40+ confirmation time is near zero.  
When blocks are close to full (not even full), things get far harder to model and users often get unpleasant surprises.  
As for "how full is full", it's not binary.  As you get closer to full you get more frequent and more egregious problems.  
Lastly, no plan ever has 100% consensus.  Ever.  "Consensus" specifically refers to less than 100% support, otherwise we use the word "unanimity."  The community has never come to a firm definition of what we want to consider "consensus", but I personally like the idea of it being a majority of each of the major constituences - a majority of miners, of devs, of economically important nodes, and of users.  If a majority of each of these subgroups supports a change, than I would call that community consensus.  
@_date: 2016-07-04 17:38:53


I mostly agree.  I've just never heard a convincing argument that a 2 MB hf is in any way a threat to decentralization.  The few devs who have bothered to try to quantify estimated that maybe 5-20% of the least efficient, most obsolete nodes in developing countries might stop functioning.  But then there's the second order effect: what's the very best way to encourage there to be more full nodes?  More bitcoin adoption, more bitcoin companies, more rich bitcoin users etc etc.  Just as bitcoin's security depends on hashpower which directly depends on bitcoin's price (b/c miners won't mine if it's unprofitable), so too does decentralization rely on full node count, which relies on general bitcoin adoption and economic value.  In particular, nearly all bitcoin companies operate full nodes, while only a tiny fraction of users do.  Encouraging the birth of more bitcoin companies is our best bet to decentralization imo, and low fees and fast confirmation times directly facilitate that.
@_date: 2016-07-04 04:57:26
I'm confused.  The people pushing for a HF wanted *more* than 2-4-8?  And miners didn't want 4+, but did want 2-4 mb?  So how did a 2 or 4 MB HF not happen last year?  It sounds like everyone wanted *at least* 2-4.

@_date: 2016-07-10 12:57:41
No, you've got it backwards.  As hashpower falls and confirmation times rise, the value of bitcoin falls.  Price falls further, further depressing hashpower, longer confirmation times, and lower price.  It's a death spiral.  This process would happen in a span of hours to a couple days.
It'd be impossible to accept bitcoin donations because the transfers wouldn't be confirmed.

Seems like this thread itself is misinformation and propaganda.  Do you have any evidence at all that cobra-bitcoin is not a member of blockstream?  Or are you just making stuff up?  @_date: 2016-07-09 22:36:32
that's not really accurate.  For a given miner, their reaction to the halving depends entirely on the price.  A swing of $50 in value of a BTC token can change a profitable miner into an unprofitable miner.  If you haven't noticed - the price of BTC has moved quite a bit in 8 years.

There's a common misunderstanding about capacity that really isn't intuitive.  I highly recommend the book "The Goal" which is taught in every Operations 101 classroom.
Basically, when capacity nears 100%, you get gridlock and malfunction because there is a natural volatility around demand for resources.  So, for example, if an average of once a week demand spikes by 12% and you're averaging 90% capacity, then once a week you're going to run out of capacity with whatever problems that entails.  There's a whole field of math that arose to prove that the optimal capacity level for any system is always less than 100%.  Just how far below 100% depends on A. the volatility of demand, and B. the cost for demand exceeding 100%.
In bitcoin, the cost of demand spiking over 100% is pretty high.  It means that some people who submitted transactions with perfectly reasonable mining fees will now see their transactions stuck for an uncertain amount of time.  Their confirmation times rise from 10 minutes to 30, 60, or whatever.  
TLDR: we need to consider bitcoin blocks as very much "full" when they're substantially below 100%.  Exactly how far below I can't say, but we've been hitting transaction backlogs somewhat frequently for the last couple months.
@_date: 2016-07-04 15:18:04
Definitely.  The only objections to segwit that I've heard are that it's complex and risky and thus needs to be implemented very slowly.  Hardly anyone (&lt;1% of the bitcoin community) opposes it outright.  I view Segwit as totally unrelated from a HF.  Neither is dependent on the other, and neither's code is related to the other.  What I struggle to understand is why we didn't HF to 2 MB in, say, September of last year and then add SegWit a year later.
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:44:06


Then you're in the wrong cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin is built on satoshi consensus, and core devs push changes onto the community every 4 months or so via soft fork.  Sure, you don't have to run the soft fork upgrade, but if everyone else does, it obviously effects the network of which you're a part, and the value of your coins.  Lastly, bitcoin has great architecture but as Satoshi noted several times, it will eventually require a hard fork for certain obvious fixes/upgrades.  It's doubtful that 100% of people will support the necessary HFs, so we better hope that we can agree to act without unanimity or bitcoin will be replaced by a new crypto to replace the now obsolete bitcoin.


I think users want relatively fast confirmation times and know that a typical confirmation is supposed to take about 10 minutes with some variance around it.  Based on that knowledge, a confirmation that takes over 90 minutes should be statistically impossible, a 5+ sigma event, and that's when I tend to see users posting on reddit to ask/complain.
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:44:23

From a simplistic perspective, Chinese miners should want blocks as small as possible.  100 kb would be better than 1 MB and so on.  I assume they believed that moderately bigger blocks would encourage adoption and therefore a rise in BTC prices, and therefore a rise in the value of their mining equipment and in mining rewards.
  As for the price - we're in dangerous territory with BTC &lt; $800.  No one knows the exactly level, but most miners were just marginally profitable at $440.  As the block reward halves, we're likely going to lose some hash power.  Just how much will depend on the exact price level.  The price *needed* to double just to maintain hash power and avoid banrupting a lot of miners.
@_date: 2016-07-02 20:30:22
It's a risky gamble that the use cases that bitcoin was built to fill but cannot currently fill (like microtransactions are medium sized retail payments) will be filled by a competitor.
@_date: 2016-07-09 23:07:11
The concern is that less hashpower = longer confirmation times and higher electricity cost per block payout, which can cause a vicious cycle in which hashpower falls to zero before the next difficulty adjustment.  So far, this appears to not be a major risk, but if the BTC price fell by half again, I think this would be likely.
