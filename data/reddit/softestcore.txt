I don't know much about lightning, but there seem to be security concerns (security is expensive), which create market for trusted payment hubs and it can still lead to on-chain congestion when there's an attempt to close a lot of payment channels at once.
Is on-chain scaling for sure a worse solution?

Then there are things like PoS and larger blocksize, but I understand that this is not popular around here.

What cryptocurrency would you recommend for microtransactions, if BTC isn't it?
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:01:17
Because it allows easy sharding.

PoS by itself doesn't, but it allows scaling solutions that are not possible with PoW. And I do agree that there's something as too large  blocks, but this limit is not fixed, it changes depending on the technological infrastructure and wanting to make blocks as large as possible is just as silly as setting their size at some arbitrary low number.

Existence of a security flaw doesn't mean the person who exploits the flaw isn't acting immorally. Just because something is algorithmically possible, doesn't mean it's legitimate. We are far from being able to substitute source code for ethics. Cryptocurrencies operate on the basis of consensus, the majority can decide to change the way a currency works and it can decide to rollback any particular transaction. That's both a technical reality and the way things should work. Mistakes are inevitable, if we want public to trust and use cryptocurrencies, we have to show that when big fuck-ups happen, they can be fixed or mitigated.

Since it's over HTTPS, the only danger is blockchain.info itself, when using the Chrome extension even that threat is neutralized. Am I missing something?

This is what cryptocurrency is, the majority rule. The algorithm can be overpowered if majority agrees on it and I like it like that.

If I forget to lock my door and somebody cleans my apartment, isn't it stealing?


Not a few leaders, it would have to be the majority of the community. And from my viewpoint, the fact the community is willing to step in, in extreme cases like this, strengthens not weakens my trust in the currency. If there is something scary about blockchain, it's the fascism of bad code. I'm glad there's a human operated kill switch.

I'm new to Bitcoin, why is blockchain.info a terrible online wallet and what are the better alternatives?

Lol no, I'm not Jewish you fucking nazi. You should move to Russia, I've heard they are pretty traditional and white. They have shit economy, institutions riddled with nepotism and corruption but I guess you can't have everything, eh? Good bye.

Can anybody ELI5 what is the history between Gavin and current core?
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:48:33
This made me laugh, but then again, as an ETH holder I was already in a good mood today.

The most convincing evidence that Wright isn't Satoshi is how inane his attempts at deception were, I refuse to believe that creator of bitcoin could be so naive as to think that he can get away with what Wright tried to pull.

What was the supposed purpose of the private demonstration, why not just wait for the public proof?
@_date: 2016-05-05 23:13:32
Can somebody explain to me why would Gavin accept the private "demonstration" when he knows perfectly well that it is both possible and absolutely safe to provide a public proof? Did Gavin ever provide the reason why was the whole thing done behind closed doors?
I'm not yet entirely convinced that "con artists can fool even the smartest people" is moral of this particular story.

We live in a global world, people from different backgrounds interacting with each other is inevitable, problem of ethnic and cultural conflict has to be solved. Thinking we can go back to the way things were in the past is naive. There used to be great animosity among European nations, number of pointless wars, then we got over it. The fact western countries are the most diverse is not result of some ploy, we are diverse because we are wealthy and we are wealthy because we are diverse, free trade and economic migration is what got us where we are.
If you think there is no precedent for people overcoming ethnic and cultural divides, you're simply wrong, history is full of them. Most of the ways people categorized world into us and others are long forgotten, remember Romans and barbarians? The boundaries will change, that's a given, it's only a question of how we get there.

Segregated people mistrust each other even more, they just come into contact less often.
@_date: 2016-05-07 19:20:33
Not all of them, for example in the technological sector, from my experience, ethnicity is not nearly as important. I work in a fairly diverse workplace and we get along fine. If people work together or are able to find some other kind of common ground, these old dividing lines fade away. It's mostly members of powerless working class who fall back to ethnicity as a both unifying and dividing device, because they live precarious lives and need all the stability they can get. Ethnicity as a basis for social cohesion is an anachronism, not something that should be celebrated.

You obviously have no idea how bitcoin works, signatures produced with that key are already publicly available.
