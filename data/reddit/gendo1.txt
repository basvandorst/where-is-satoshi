And they *only* had 25% hashpower then...
That's why any pool having over 20% is disturbing.

Users can add, update and remove businesses on OSM/Coinmap. If you see a merchant isn't taking BTC, remove it.
1) There is a blue asterisk next to the name of each venue to open that node in OSM.
2) Edit. 
3) Delete payment tag (or the whole node if it's just spam).
4) Save changes to OSM.
5) Coinmap will update in 1 hour.

1) privacy (nice for porn/prescription meds/whatever is illegal in some crappy country), 2) accesibility (unbanked population can use it), 3) low transaction fees, 4) decentralized (neither banks nor governments can freeze your account), 5) free to store and transport, 6) irreversibility of transactions (this is convenient to merchants), 7) mined by the people (not debt-based like fiat), 8) quick payment confirmation (unlike credit cards), 9) 100% voluntary adoption, 10) transparency (open source code, public ledger, BTC mined per block known, hashrate known), 11) scarcity (21M limit), 12) can't be forged, 13) it's a great way to defund corrupt govts, 14) great divisiblity (much better than gold or fiat), 15) efficiency (no third party needed in a transaction making it cheaper, trustless and more secure).
I would recommend watching Molyneux and Antonopoulos videos on Youtube and reading Nakamoto's paper for further insights.

Remember the "unknown" are several pools. Blockchain.info only reports 8 pools as "known". All the others (20+) are unknown, check it here: [
This site lists a few more than blockchain: [

+5000 users, spanish-speaking FB group. 
Some users mention BTC to merchants. Others leave tips in restaurants.  
Already being used in cabs: 
I would say adoption is ok. Should increase as the peso bleeds to death.

This is one method of accelerating the initial blockchain download process, while helping the bitcoin P2P network by offloading data download traffic from public P2P nodes. This download is not for those who are already running the bitcoin client.

8 or less connections mean router/firewall is blocking the port, so that's not useful. Port 8333 (check open port w google) should be open if you want to contribute.

BTC are priced the same everywhere. The only difference in Argentina is an "official ARS/USD exchange rate" that's about 50% of the "real ARS/USD exchange rate". It's meaningless. Noone sells BTC or USD at the "official rate". The population can't get USD at the official rate, only the govt can (by forcing people who have USD to sell them at a rate they wouldn't).
1 USD = 14.2 ARS today.
