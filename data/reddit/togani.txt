This is an old post but I am interested in the mechanisms if you are still there.


-So say A-&gt;N1-&gt;N2-&gt;B, what happens if N2 confirms and sends the transaction after the 1 second has passed? There is no way B would know whether precisely 1 second has passed even if the information is time stamped. There is no central server to broadcast a universally agreed time or is there?
In such case, B might approve two payments from A if A starts to use another route A-&gt;N3-&gt;N4-&gt;B even when A was just trying to pay B once.


-What if you have depleted your funds already? So if the real balance should be You: 0 btc, Me: 2 btc. You can try to broadcast a fraudulent balance at no possible penalty at all?


-What if B sends the 1btc to C then A says it has already finished the transaction through another route (A)-&gt;(D)-&gt;(C)? B would end up without that btc it sendT out if B doesn't manually check and broadcast on the main net that the previous transaction of (B)-&gt;(C) is not valid?
