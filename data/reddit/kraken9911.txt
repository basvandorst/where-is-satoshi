How did you cash out?  coins.ph?  I've put 4k usd into btc and alts but I haven't actually cashed out yet.  I know coins.ph lets you with annual limits and they also take roughly a 3-5% cut.  Asking because I live in the Philippines but I do also have a US bank account but would rather deal locally.

Thank you for the info.  Do you know anyone that's tried Ethereum through Abra for cashout?  They just started ETH in the ph last month.  Those btc TX Fees are rough compared to the current $2 eth fee.

Any movement of coins internally on say an exchange or mining pool has no fees because it's all just ledger accounting from within.  Only going outwards through the internet do tx fees kick in.

Just be mindful if your mining area will be part of your domicile, ASIC's are fucking loud.  This is why I went with GPU mining with a similar budget to setting up a single S9.  It can run in my living room while only making a silent whirring noise and when the vid cards reach obsolescence, they can still be resold to budget gamers for a decent return on the investment. My daily profits are about $10 less than a single s9 on a normal day and I have the flexibility to mine a variety of algorithms.

the blockchain technology is here to stay.  I think everyone in and out of the crypto community is mostly agreed on that.  No need for us to keep reaffirming ourselves of what's a given already.  Lambos on the other hand are not a given so it's fun to dream.

That's what I love about the blockchain.  If all the big boy miners got nuked, bitcoin doesn't care because this opens a massive opportunity for individuals to step in with gpus and possibly even cpus in a worst case scenario.  Either way the mining doesn't stop.

Yeah very.  Its a minor city on a sheltered island (not open to open ocean) and violent crimes are non-existant except for the occasional revenge killing over debts or drugs.  Muggings are very rare.
Digital nomads love southeast asia because even if you make a pittance of 1k usd, youre still solidly middle class here by local wages.  upper middle would be around $1600-2000 usd a month
Theres a reason theres thousands of retired americans here.  Social security wouldnt secure shit for you in the states except a life in a shitty elderly home.  Over here a lot of guys are living high on the horse on just ss alone and can have a full time live in servant for 100 usd a month plus their food/lodging accomodations.

Look up Kyle Jennermann.  Canadian dude in his early 30's moved to the Philippines and started his own facebook/youtube blog where he travels around the country experiencing the culture and just totally gets into everything he sees.  He's a national celebrity now because if there's one thing I know, it's that Filipinos LOVE when a white foreigner comes to their country and just  praise everything.  Smart dude.  He's even gotten appearances on commercials for local products now.
Personally I call bullshit on his act as it just reeks to my senses as a westerner but I give him credit for carving out a niche the way he did.  His job now is literally touring the country exploring every landmark/beach/mountain/food offerings.

It's not popular in the first world but in the philippines, a lot of people with smartphones buy prepaid "load" with cash daily to keep their phone running.  Practically every convenience store sells them.  You could pay as little as $0.50 a day for unlimited texts/calls and I think $1 for data.  Banks here are really unncessary for many given this is a cash basis economy.

In the US system, the person could be innocent with no charges pressed against him but the money is always guilty hence asset forfeiture being wildly popular with police jurisdictions to pad their budget since it takes a long ass time and money to get your money back.
