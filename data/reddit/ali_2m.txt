I would ask you to donate the gold to a charity, but you already bought them ��‍♂️
Guess I have just to say thank you for making the community day. This gesture surly makes many hodlers happy after seeing our portfolios lose over 95% of their highest values.
I ain’t selling that gold just like I ain’t selling my bitcoin

I have had a mutual fund worth $7500 back in 2013. And it’s now worth $7200 �� I ain’t selling just like I ain’t selling my bitcoins that I have been accumulating for over 2 years now. 
My only regret is that I didn’t buy earlier. I couldn’t find a way to buy with a credit card prior to 2016

u/wands you have been in Reddit for 10 years. Holly shit! That’s a long time
@_date: 2018-12-12 11:41:35
hahahaha good one

This is a dumb analogy. It doesn’t even make sense when it comes to the very basic concept of a ledger/wallet.
Sure, you used to have that number, but then you sent it to me. So, we both have it now?

Your mama is so stupid she thought she had to sell her bitcoin on coinbase to pay for a bitcoin T-shirt

I honestly want the price to drop to below $3200 and goes sideways and then gradually up

Oh a redditor since 2005 and doesn’t know this subreddit. How amazing
@_date: 2018-12-01 08:39:05
