You should do a post about crimes of US. Dropping Nuclear bombs, supporting wars based on WMDs, policing the world and destroying your own WTC so that you don’t need to talk about Gold standards ever! Satoshi created bitcoin first and foremost for US. To bring the poor blind US people out of this madness. If all of you are smart, you will rise up and bring a revolution in US. Instead of being enslaved by a few that use all of you to enslave the rest of the world. Wake up US people! Ask for reforms and give your poor or young ones a helping hand by abolishing student loans, accredited investors bullshit and making bitcoin the currency for US citizens! Haha but you guys prefer to build walls 
@_date: 2018-09-05 06:32:43
Come on Americans take some feedback! The world can also talk about your mothers and their love for horses. Did a search on camels and mid eastern men. Found nothing! Did a search on Texas mothers and horses and found a lot of naughty stuff. American fucktards! Just keep down voting the voices of truth and sucking balls of a couple of rich guys who control your everything! 
@_date: 2018-09-05 06:19:56
Why worthless? You can question everyone else but the world can’t question you fuckers ? As I said, retarded fuckers this 200 million 
@_date: 2018-09-04 23:04:48
I would prefer raising camels than living my life at a train station with a 100K loan and all that so called education ��. Retarded Americans 
@_date: 2018-09-05 01:40:19
You don’t have to say anything man to retarded Americans. The 200 million of them are bombing the world to suck balls of a few men that just print their money. That is their thing. All working hard, joining together to get the honor of sucking balls of a dozen men. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 01:48:56
The US gov decides ? Hahaha! Just the monetary policy ? Entire fucktard US population fighting for the honor of sucking balls or licking ass of a few people who print paper money for you is a great lifestyle. Also stop calling yourself western. Don’t group Europe with ass lickers please ? 
Edit: If you want to have a serious discussion about masses in US with real data, how it is US the only place that desperately needs bitcoin, please feel free to ask. I just have a condition that you ask that with an open mind and not an ass licker mindset?

Obviously! Terrorists can’t plan with kind of a volatile market. Crypto prices will terrorise a terrorist! Imagine planning an attack with $1 million only to find out that you only had $10000 in the first place. Of course you spent that on crazy parties before something crazy and now CIA is holding you accountable for loss of their funds 
@_date: 2018-08-15 10:59:39
Probably the correct word for US is fucktatorship 
@_date: 2018-08-15 08:55:42
What do you call a country where a few people are controlling the mind, money and free will of 200 or so million without them even knowing it? Money can buy anything in the US. Media is bought, people’s opinion are influenced and hence their votes are bought. You have student loans and wars shoved down like no ones business. After all that you have a private institute printing money for you. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:28:10
10 billion dollars according to many estimates

But hidden dictatorship is good right ? US and Singapore seem to be doing fine ��
@_date: 2018-05-30 02:07:54
Wrong! Most important person is Jihan Wu and Roger Ver and many more idiots who own 70% of the so called decentralised currency. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:06:33
At least weak countries don’t let a private institute print money for them and control them. I am sure in the Long run turkey will be fine and lira will be fine. Can’t say the same for bitcoin or US dollar 
@_date: 2018-05-02 14:38:13
5%. That would be 1000 when the price of bitcoin is $20000 �� 
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:53:51
That btrash is 90% owned by them ����. They own a lot of bitcoin too. Otherwise how would btrash have value ? 
@_date: 2018-08-01 08:54:19
Haha this is so cool 
@_date: 2018-05-30 10:55:25
I didn’t say just the two of them. Bittrex, Binance, Gemini, Bitmex are mega exchanges. They are not decentralised exchanges you know. The bots on those exchanges are not accumulating Neo �� 
@_date: 2018-10-11 03:19:47
Dollars ? Forever the slave ? ��
@_date: 2018-10-13 04:24:53
And yet bitcoin OGs are little girls crying all the time and forking bitcoin after every single argument!

@_date: 2018-06-09 04:47:17
They want you to wait and not sell those precious 500BTC. They will enable it when BTC is 50K ��

@_date: 2018-06-29 03:11:27
Based on just your statement, i can think of two possibilities.
1) I wasn’t there during the 2014/2015 crash. I don’t know anyone who was. You are also new to the space so the space has had a lot of adoption. This means a thousand times more people(additionally buying power) and hence you are wrong 
Or 
2) you have been in the space since the 2014/2015 time and the only one who didn’t make millions to still continue to be lurking around. This means you were the worst investor and can’t be taken seriously anyways 
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:08:11
So satoshi did actually win!! 
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:18:58
We get it ��
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:59:49
I think Venezuela should drop Petro dollar into USA. So the poor and middle class can start using something that doesn’t make them puppets of the Rothschild. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 05:34:24
Wow can’t believe that happened in this life. With 50 bitcoins I think I can change the lives of a few million ���� and die a happy man. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:22:57
Honestly I completely agree with you. The entire world has gone full retard. Americans just love war and Chinese just love to copy everything. Plus most of them will do anything for money. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:34:05
I don’t disagree with you. However, it could be about us being our own banks rather than trusting banks. Also I don’t personally believe in taking power from governments only to give it to a few early bitcoiners. Perhaps it is about facilitating small communities to use their own currencies and power being distributed to the grassroots. Some altcoins might actually facilitate this in the real world. Some altcoins are themselves like these communities. Hence, I do prefer a few big crypto’s and don’t mind Altcoin being as big as bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 13:33:40
Surely you understand that the next bull run will be brought by something other than bitcoin. Thanks to Ethereum, bitcoin saw the previous bull run. Not adding another would be such a shame! 
@_date: 2018-11-24 13:55:42
I am sure big players are going to do the opposite than expected. Maybe they will pump one of the shitty centralised payment networks like stellar or ripple and wait for all the investors to follow them, only to pounce back to bitcoin. We couldn’t handle it against whales so what makes you think that these sharks will be easier ?  It will still not be the ultimate bull run. Real adoption where there will be fair competition between crypto and fiat is going to bring the next real bull run. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:38:25
Atleast they didn’t ask a few people to control their money and basically everything. I mean like the US did with fed. So I am not so worried about the Chinese people or the Chinese currency. More the blind idiots ���� 
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:39:55
He admitted because he was offered a lifetime supply of all the hot agents! 
@_date: 2018-11-24 03:33:33
I am all in on crypto but yea these guys are really stupid! ��‍♂️ 
@_date: 2018-11-01 09:44:32
him saying something on bitcoin is a Signal for all the rich retards to start buying ? ����
@_date: 2018-11-15 09:27:21
Sure! Please continue to hold a shitty currency like US dollar. A currency used to control the entire world, bomb millions or starve millions like in Venezuela. Thank you! 
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:54:53
Can’t wait for the American oppressors to get a big chinese stick 
@_date: 2018-07-22 12:13:35
He is probably having his evil laugh thinking how is bots and fake order books are going to take over all the free btrash or bitcoin paper wallets guys are happy to get hold of 
@_date: 2018-07-15 06:09:13
Stock markets, SEC and Federal Reserve! All part of the toilet paper world. 
Madoff said in the June 17, 2009, interview that SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro was a "dear friend", and SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter was a "terrific lady" whom he knew "pretty well".
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:10:45
I don’t think they will and they can. They are slow as they need to protect their interests which is in old systems, controlled stock markets and their toilet papers! They are probably slowing down the entire space with such bashing and criticism so that they can get the best of both words. Let us hope their manoeuvres backfire this time and japan and Korea conquer all! Sorry NewYork and London you really do deserve to be the worst economies! 
@_date: 2018-07-18 23:41:33
Please give it to me crypto!! The retirement I mean ������
@_date: 2018-07-10 09:42:11
But what many of the idiotic bitcoin maximalists don’t understand is that the value of bitcoin would be next to piss and shit, had it not been because of Ethereum/smart contracts and the entire eco system with token economics. I hope some of those idiots read this and stop thrashing every other project. Bitcoin will gain more and more value as the ecosystem grows. I am sure satoshi understood that. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 13:15:26
I liked your comment. However, you must also understand that guys at the other end are rich in toilet paper and they have smart bots “these bots know everything on the asset included Fud or Fomo news in real-time”.  They have nothing to lose. Not toilet paper Nor losses inside the market 
@_date: 2018-07-24 08:55:22
Again another shitty government that no one cares about 
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:37:32
Only Alts and real world crypto use cases bring back value to bitcoin. Only retards fail to see that 
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:25:25
In the Long run it’s amazing for Non US citizens. Finally will break the shackles of slavery to US, where US just prints toilet paper and makes the world believe it has value. Then goes on being a world police just because it can print toilet paper!  
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:24:03
Another article that should say US dollar instead of bitcoin ��
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:59:33
The most amount of money in the Swiss banks belongs to the corrupt Pakistan government officials. They probably found out that bitcoin is traceable and this law is to make sure that government officials are not misled. The rule is just to ensure safe corruption.
