ok, so overwhelming huge amount of TA's calling for 11k top then down to 8.5 which makes me think shorts are gonna load up then BTC is gonna pop and blow up more shorts.  I'll be cheering either way because hey I'm no fool - if it does drop then buying some BTC at 8.5k is a gift.

ya, where is that redditor that said he was long from $9xxx ?  man I think he must be feeling pretty good right now.

You may not like Max Keiser but I highly advise you to watch one of his videos: [Episode 1399 - "Deutsche bank’s death spiral"]( where you can learn about DB bad debt (apparently in the trillions) being nationalized by Germany which means very painful news for German taxpayers. Maybe he's wrong, but the video was very interesting.
From what I garnered, DB was DOA in 2008 just like Lehman Bros.  somehow they figured out a way for taxpayers to bail them out (ie. nationalizing the losses)

hey you must be active on the greaterfool.ca site.  lots of crazy trolling in there. great site though otherwise

meh, maybe get in touch with the guy, start a crowdfund with a meaningful payout that would be risk appropriate. (ie. if I add $100 to the fund, I get .5 bitcoin if you find it) 
TBH it would make for a huge story if you actually find it.. good advertising

I used coinsquare.io and it was instant for me though you may need deeper verification (ie. scan license, etc)
alternatively, there is a thing called flexepin - basically a coupon code that you can buy in a LOT of places then redeem to a wallet online. My initial purchase was through this, but the fees are more significant. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:41:12
this could be interesting. the question is, will Russia and US financial system work together to manipulate the BTC price or will they square off against each other? My hope is for the latter!

**"Without a doubt, bitcoin and its forked offspring will eventually be regulated since they’re securities, not money. It’s only a matter of time. Investors need to be protected from their own idiocy and greed. Millions of them are about to be preyed upon. As digital currencies become more widespread they may also threaten government’s ability to run stable currencies or collect taxes. In a battle between the Fed or the US government and bitcoin, guess who’ll get creamed?"**
**"Hacking is a constant concern, as is terrorism activity using bitcoin. And consider the devastation caused by a network outage that would blank the entire value of  ‘money’ which does not exist and is backed by no government.**
**There are no institutional players in the bitcoin space yet, so valuations are being driven by emotionally-charged retail investors. Yes, just like tulips in 1620. It’s amazing what people will allow themselves to believe. All this may change next month when the first futures exchange opens for bitcoin. Suddenly there’ll be an efficient way to short this thing. You can bet billions of dollars are waiting to do just that."**
..this post from greaterfool.ca kinda freaked me out as Garth is well respected and knows his financials very well. However, the terrorism and network outage points are definitely overblown. 
I hold a very small amount of BTC anyway but from what I can tell, it could be a rocky road ahead. not sure if this will be interpreted as FUD - it's not my intention so sorry if it too negative. I'll still be holding anyway no matter what happens.

CME + CFTC + FED + USGOVT are all working with each other if you believe [this]( Anything CME wants to do with Bitcoin will be rubber stamped and fast tracked.

Let me interpret this statement for you all:
"The futures that we currently use are not effective enough in supressing the price of Bitcoin (and by extension its popularity and adoption rate). Because of this, we will now launch options to allow institutions with unlimited amounts of money to be able to supress the price of Bitcoin more effectively."

yes, "they" do pump as well... especially if there is a lot of speculative shorts - they take it where they want for max pain.
@_date: 2019-10-24 03:08:13
for me - don't trade, either buy or choose not to. If you do buy BTC, move if off an exchange so the exchange can't lend it for shorting.
odds are against you being successful, but if you choose to trade, use low leverage and be very wary if you find you are long (or short) when the majority is long (or short) as well.
i guess one other thing - patience. perhaps predatory manipulation will go away in 5, 10 years and maybe it will work out.. or maybe not
@_date: 2019-10-24 02:15:09
Personally, I think you should be going after CME first and foremost.
@_date: 2019-10-24 01:50:36
CME sets the price of BTC and from what I see, they will set it anywhere they want. they will continue tanking it until there is complete loss of hope to the point where hodlers will be ridiculed.  But I'll still be stackin.
@_date: 2019-10-24 02:03:00
Entity A: dumps huge amounts of Bitcoin on one or more exchanges around a certain date. Dumping large amounts of Bitcoin can be done by "borrowing" Bitcoin from exchanges, large holders or miners - from what I know they would pay a premium and/or interest for doing this. they can borrow until there is no more BTC available.
Entity B: makes huge bets via CME on a lower bitcoin price around this date.
Entity A and Entity B are often the same person or are colluding together.  The amount they make via "in the money" futures contracts are typically far more than the cost of borrowing BTC.
rinse and repeat - this is how derivatives fuck markets endlessly.
add in the fact that speculative positions are posted and known well in the industry, derivatives are used to manipulate price to cause maximum pain - ie blowing up the most speculators possible. 
derivatives are essentially a highly effective tool used to grab money from the 99% and transfer it to the 1%.

yeah I don't think that is out of the question. seems everyone is now expecting to see 8k. lots of gloom and doom now and for me, this is when I like buying. if expectations of drop continue to increase, then there is a good chance of a big pop upward in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:30:26
Hey, great post! thank you for this. 
not sure if helpful but you might consider mentioning that quite a few bitcoin are lost/gone. not sure on amounts but some estimates put the amount of missing bitcoin at very significant levels.. like 5 million or so
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:13:52
yep. they definitely hate it. On the upside, this really shows that virtual currency is finally forcing banks to start serving its customers better.  
funny how it also says some banks are looking at implementing their own virtual currency, 'but did not see scope for "adventurous applications" of such technology... so I guess that means they aren't?

Hey just wanted to let you know that there might be some savings options for when you get back in.  Something like take out an investment loan with your paid for house as collateral (HELOC) 
..In many countries the loan interest is deductible as long as the full amount of the loan is invested and possibly you could reduce the investment tax burden very significantly as well -- this depends on where you live but IMO its worth checking out. 
In Canada this can become a very lucrative way to invest as long as you are careful (basically talk with a acct/tax specialist so you do it right)
@_date: 2019-12-04 23:18:35
Yes, no worries there. It is not straightforward and I very well could be wrong - the transcript is long and this area I admit is open to interpretation..  this section is what I"m trying to interpret: 
"Stephan Livera: You also point out in the article that it’s approximately 200,000 BTC that was total in the amount that got scammed. So there might be more to come.
ErgoBTC: Yeah, that’s correct. At the time I wrote the medium article, I hadn’t really done enough digging into the size and extent of the PlusToken premix cluster, after I thought that for the most part they had finished at least around the time that I was writing the medium article, I thought that they were done. I found some self shuffled transactions that were sort of stalled and weren’t going anywhere. Some addresses that were full of funds, that hadn’t moved since, since the middle of August. And recently, they had started moving again. And that’s when, I followed them through the self shuffling process and I found a reused address that was used to sort of collect transactions before sending them, typically to Huobi again, more address reuse.
ErgoBTC: From there I evaluated the, the history of that transaction and was able to sort of verify at least how much through that address had been sold. I think around by now, I think it’s around 77,000 that I was able to cluster through that address.
Stephan Livera: Wow.
ErgoBTC: Yeah. I mean it’s starting to get, astronomical numbers. You sort of start to, lose track. But after having looked at that, the most recent address reuse, with Huobi I went back and decided that, okay, I need to really get a handle on what premixed funds are left. And that’s when I sort of came up with the recent, tweet thread that estimated around 185,000 Bitcoin at least in their premixed cluster."
The last couple sentences - what I garner from this - is that 
1) he needed to go back and get a handle on what premixed funds are left
2) and.. the 185,000 in their premixed cluster - does this mean BTC left or total? I took it as left but maybe that is total..?
apologies if I'm wrong - not trying to misinform or be an ass
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:34:53
Powerful information in the plustoken post [here] ( I've been trying to get a handle on how much BTC they have left to sell and apparently it is estimated at approx. 180,000. -&gt; this is basically 100days of mining proceeds at current reward levels 
One positive takeaway from this is that BTC price is still quite strong even with this added sell pressure - a good indication that this an excellent time to be picking up more BTC for a mid to long term hold (min 1 year). People with long term investment horizons and money to invest should see this a a fantastic opportunity. 
Once the plustoken scammed BTC is sold off - assume mid to late 2020, the major drop in BTC liquidity will probably shock the market.

in the latter half of the transcript search for 60% - there are a couple good paragraphs about it. I include an excerpt below but I'd advise you read it completely as he talks about perhaps the scammers have stopped for a while as their significant selling pressure was perhaps getting too public ..  
here is an excerpt on daily:
"So I really think that what’s happening now is basically just working off a little bit of a hangover from, from that party. And I had tried to do some estimates where I tried to total how many coins were mixed and then estimate over the period of time since mixing started to come up with a little bit of an average of the daily distribution from the PlusToken scammers and I think I had numbers somewhere between 1100 and 1300 Bitcoin, which, if you put in perspective compared to the miner daily issuance is, something on the order of 60% or so of the, of the miner’s daily issuance. "
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:07:15
nice that it is transcripted... very interesting and informative read
so the scammers are estimated to still hold 180,000 BTC  For me this means:
1) BTC will be on sale for a while yet
2) Once they are done selling we will have a real liquidity issue so the pop should be huge
I'm happy BTC price is low when scammers sell - it gets absorbed into the market faster. I'm also glad I'm a hodler not a trader right now - trading when you have a huge undpredictable whale can get chaotic fast

man, so much great content coming down the pipes lately. Too bad there are so few people (outside of our space of course) paying attention.
* Max Keiser recent episodes are wild. Most recent ["Time No Longer Has a Price"]( overnight Fed funds look like fallout from other banks not trusting DB is solvent anymore.. looks like Deutsche Bank is going down. I know the community has issues with some of his past stuff, but lately he is killing it - especially the last 15 episodes or so. 
* endless qe in europe getting greenlit
* Andreas' latest ["Outside the Golden Cage of Banking"]( 
  listen to this if you haven't yet. I really can't believe there are so few views and subscribers to this man. He has truly mastered his craft and deserves the attention of a world audience.
edit: To be honest, if I'm either one of the guys, I'd be hiring some security so I don't get suicided. I have had a couple nocoiner friends lately that have hopped on the Bitcoin train just because I told them to start listening to Max and Andreas.
edit2: sending out positive vibes, so upvotes for everyone below me
