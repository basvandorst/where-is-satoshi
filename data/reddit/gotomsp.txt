Visa charges much more than Ripple, that is not cheap and limits can be low. XRP and Ripple Network won’t decrease your control as it only affects what you are already doing with the banking system. You can keep doing what you’re doing in crypto without XRP affecting it once your fiat is in the crypto economy. 
I don’t understand the irrational hatred. If you aren’t using fiat in the first place it doesn’t affect you.

So what you are saying is that I should buy 1,000 coins of each sub $.01 currency that I come across and in 8 years time I will have $25 million dollars and a Lambo at least?

Merchants don’t simply swallow the Visa charge, they price it into the product.

I think they want to turn fiat into Lambos actually, who wants a Fiat?

That’s not how you spell Lambo
