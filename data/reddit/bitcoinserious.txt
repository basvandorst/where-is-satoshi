The hurdles aren't in the crypto space, they're in the regulation space!
@_date: 2014-04-29 20:23:17
Maybe open an online bank account?

Capital One 360 is online only and offers free checking. There are many others.

Update in progress!
For those who didn't notice that this wasn't a self.post, [here's the link](@_date: 2015-05-06 19:10:18
I did, but I haven't updated it to match the list yet. Plus, it's harder to tell from a multi what interesting subs are most active, if you don't want to see content from all of them.

Had AcceptingBTC but added the other two, thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-06 22:42:33
Ooo nice!
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:58:43
I added a small "non-bitcoin blockchain usage" section to the bottom. Name is a bit clunky. I don't want to get into broad crypto stuff, but keep it exclusive to bitcoin currency, protocol, blockchain.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:04:20
Thanks for the soda!
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:54:00
@_date: 2015-05-06 19:19:16
I agree that it's interesting, but not necessarily to the same audience.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:00:00
Already there. There's also @_date: 2015-05-06 17:53:33
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:51:21
Me too for the most important news &amp; updates in the bitcoin world, but the smaller subs often get quality content that just isn't successful on the main sub, so they can be worth subscribing to too.
@_date: 2015-05-07 13:34:26
Good question
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:42:22
@_date: 2014-05-02 21:53:28


Are you assuming that no other hotel providers will offer bitcoin payment? It helps to be first, of course.
@_date: 2015-05-06 20:38:42
Added 4 that I didn't recognize, thanks.

Ok well I'm not going to make a bitcoin list, but if you want to, have at it!
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:46:51
Interesting. Added.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:51:30
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:56:56
These aren't exclusive to bitcoin so they're probably too broad for this list.
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:41:57
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:40:52
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:48:38
Missed this one before my current save, but I'll add it to the next update.
@_date: 2015-05-06 20:03:29
I did miss that. Will add to my next update.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:57:03
@_date: 2015-05-07 13:25:38
And thank you for the bits!
@_date: 2015-05-06 19:16:47
I'll add it as a separate category.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:51:47
Added, thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:05:08
Good point.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:46:33
Added, but it might be a little too broad for this list since it's not bitcoin/blockchain exclusive.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:49:25


Nope. But if you have that link it might be worth adding somewhere.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:55:41
I think it's off topic. They're essentially nsfw subs that use bitcoin for payment/tipping, not bitcoin subs that happen to be nsfw.
@_date: 2015-05-06 19:11:17
Generous, thanks!

I'm gonna go take a dump. That's all I know.
