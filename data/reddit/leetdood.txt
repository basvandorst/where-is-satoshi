You can both be circlejerking. Just because the media is busy circlejerking themselves into a frenzy about how bitcoin is bad, doesn't mean people here can't do the same thing, just replace 'bad' with 'good'.

For the average user, checking your twitter is much easier than checking a PGP key. But I guess you're only interested in talking to a highly technical audience.

Holy fuck what a douchebag.

They also tend to be annoyed by someone talking about the same subject over again and again.

You're not very smart if you couldn't tell that was sarcasm. You said the same thing earlier, and I don't believe that you genuinely understand what people are telling you either. It's especially evident when you can't understand that somebody's being sarcastic at your expense.

Your opinion was tripe. This isn't anti-bitcoin propaganda, this is just media ignorance. You seem to be **ignorant** of the difference.

No. Investments that are stable and long term are way longer than 2 years. We're talking 10 years at the minimum. Your investment is still short term, and even if you plan to hold for 50 bajillion years this doesn't change the fact that bitcoin is a volatile investment. If it wasn't, it would not have lost 50% of its value and bounced back in one night. Stable investments don't do that. You might be proud of putting all your eggs in an extremely big basket, but the point is you could lose your basket in one night and have NO eggs left. Nobody here can actually know or guarantee the future of bitcoin. You are basically gambling with your money, if it pays off for you that's fine but don't act like its any different from going to a casino and putting 100 grand on black just because you think its a guarantee.

Yes, tell me more about your guaranteed long term gains from your incredibly stable investment. Oh wait, you were talking about short term gains from a volatile investment. Never mind then.

Said the guy losing money by the minute.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:38:01
I understand why you think that.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:01:38
Maybe in english, you would say... money flows, it always goes through your fingers. So, you are losing money, but you will gain money soon enough anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:51:30
Because you don't want to lose all your money. But hey, apparently you're so smart you don't have to worry about that.
