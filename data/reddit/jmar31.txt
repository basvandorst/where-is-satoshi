You could just buy your coins from a shady bearded guy in a dark alley behind a dumpster. He might charge a smaller fee. Or he might knife you.

My friends kept asking how to buy/sell Bitcoins, so I created a quick video for them to sign up for my local exchange.

We're glad you like it!

I guess I'm a bit special that way.

We've been watching them for quite some time, and a few days ago finally decided it was time to try it out. A bunch of our friends are bitcoin users, so we wanted to help support them and the community. We feel that the more merchants that are out there, the stronger bitcoins will become. We're hoping to do our part.

Like a really fine bag of sand...

Sick! I want one for my Galaxy S4.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:52:44
Awesome! We're stoked. We tried to make it as smooth as possible.

Ya, LibertyBit has been a real pleasure to use. I recommend them to anyone trying to get into btcs.

We'll be looking at adding Android phone cases soon. Probably the S3 and S4. What do you use?

So much hamster carnage...

What about HTML5!?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:54:05
I use them too. Super quick and super easy. I'm actually making a screencast on how to sign-up and use their service. Hit me up if you're interested.
