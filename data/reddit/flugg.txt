The easier it is to convert between bitcoin and fiat, the more comfortable people will feel using and holding bitcoin without going thru fiat. Circle is an on ramp to get us there.

"Bitcoin is an existential challenge to the banks" is a great way of expressing it.

So once Ethereum's market cap reaches approx Bitcoin's market cap ($6Bn, $70/ETH), there should be approx the same mining rewards, and hence approx the same mining resources securing the system. Tada.
(Except hopefully Ethereum will get PoS going, which will allow it to scale without needing to build extra power stations to secure it, thus not adding to the ecological armageddon we're currently heading for.)

Ethereum is planning to switch to proof of stake. Assuming that scheme can be made to work reliably, I wonder how that affects the calculations.

Well done Bitcoin for being conservative. Well done Ethereum for being courageous.

Are we doing bitcoin to disrupt the elites, or become part of the elites?

Any word on whether other hardware wallets are affected? Ledger nano s?

PayPal is p2PayPal2p, and all kinds of weird can happen in that middle bit.

Thank you sir. Loving your product btw.

No one sets out to be extreme. Every voice is valid, including yours. Things will play out and everything will be fine.

Because Ethereum is heading towards the largest market cap, leaving these Bitcoin squabbles behind in its wake?

There inevitably comes a point at which your bitcoins have risen in value so much that you can retire by cashing in 1% per year.

How could a bank know about a customer accepting cash deposits on localbitcoins?

No need to be rational if you have more money than you'll ever need.

No one's forcing you to use Ethpool

The will of the people is required to set up mining rigs and nodes and wallets and to actually spend/accept Bitcoin. I don't think any consequences are guaranteed. Bitcoin just enables certain outcomes.

No one forced anyone to run the Ethereum fork client.
