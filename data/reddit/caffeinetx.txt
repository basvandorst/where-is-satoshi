egold started in the 90's and is actually backed by something tangible. I'm not talking about the blockchain system I am talking about currencies formed to try and decentralize banks.

It isn't that different from anything that has ever existed, go ask bankers that have been working for over 20 years. Shit like this has popped up before.

I sold at the wrong time apparently, I thought it was stabilized around 650-700 :\ oh well. Lesson learned I'll just have to buy in again when it is low and hold longer.

Unfortunately you were looking at the moon's reflection in the ocean when you set your sites.

No, they sold their bitcoins to buy the tesla. The dealership didn't accept bitcoins in the trade, only USD. It still isn't accepted as currency everywhere, most places won't want to hold something as volatile as crypto currency. In seconds they can lose money on a deal with it at the point bitcoins are at right now.

and 
The dealership never accepted bitcoins, the buyer converted them to USD to buy the car.

1 bitcoin would be like what 1600-1800 sliders

Coinbase is a wallet, more or less a bitcoin bank. Hence they also limit your buy and sell numbers for bitcoin daily (can buy 50 bitcoins but can only sell 30 a day etc.)
They are not in the business of trading bitcoins for people flipping them back and forth for profit constantly.

pretty sure even the instant limits how much you can buy and sell per a day.
