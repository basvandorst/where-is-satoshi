Yeah but Gold is more valuable than bitcoin by the following margin: The price of gold.
@_date: 2018-08-02 03:35:38
Then his net worth would be $0.
@_date: 2018-08-01 00:51:54
You only know what the Dip is in retrospect. This could have been the 30 year high.
@_date: 2018-08-02 03:50:40
He has $130 billion, but 21 million bitcoins are worth $0.
@_date: 2018-08-01 15:35:01
Any non-zero value is a good start. Gold has non zero intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-08-02 02:59:21
Not really. It's a loss if the liquidation value of his position is less than the cash he started with.
Bummer dude.
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:26:00
The most important reminder is that Bitcoin is headed to zero cents.
@_date: 2018-08-01 13:52:57
Do not deceive yourself that 7500 will hold.
3000 by mid week

QE does nothing, just shuffles dollars from securities accounts to reserve accounts.
But really it was pretty liquid in securities form to begin with.
@_date: 2018-08-01 05:01:00
That is why you bagholders are poorer today than yesterday
@_date: 2018-08-02 01:03:08
The party with the Strongest decryption resources is called the government.
So by definition the government can always hack bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-01 02:19:28
There is "real tax" which is people working for the government. And there is "nominal tax" which you pay in dollars.
So, the reason dollars have value, is that they are a "get out of jail" coupon when it comes to tax debts.
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:03:17
 More precisely you've been throwing good money after bad 
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:48:08
Roubini and Munger also call bitcoin a scam.
I would listen to my elders.
@_date: 2018-08-02 02:26:39
My biography is that I became a billionaire in 2017 but decided to put 0 into bitcoin because I understand it to be worthless.
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:23:18
Specifically you melt the polar caps to produce Nothing
@_date: 2018-08-01 15:22:54
It's a noob term for the age-old expression Bashing
@_date: 2018-08-02 02:02:45
So, you feel that the Pentagon with a trillion dollar budget cannot hack your ridiculous torrent.
@_date: 2018-08-02 00:40:54
Bitcoin is a fake torrent with nothing on it.
That type of thing is usually deleted even from the recycle bin.
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:58:54
It will probably trade at 00.01 cents for a few months, before it goes to zero.
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:34:16
The difference is that USD is a tax credit, it pays US taxes
@_date: 2018-08-01 04:10:26
AUD pays australian taxes. USD pays american taxes. Bitcoin pays no taxes. So you can see now which of the aforementioned tokens is worthless.
@_date: 2018-08-01 00:53:00
The difference is that the state has a Printing Press, so there is no worry about a banking shortage.
On the other hand bitcoin is worthless
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:46:12
The dollar would be worthless if the US stopped collecting taxes.
But as it stands, the value of 1 dollar is equal to what the government demands you do for it. They are the only issuer (monopoly)
@_date: 2018-08-01 02:54:41
Yeah but Austrians (the correct school) realizes that producing Nothing (bitcoin) is a waste.
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:58:27
There is nothing to actually do with a bitcoin.
The only hope is to pawn it off to Greater Fool.
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:10:48
That is why they shouldn't be called currencies.
@_date: 2018-08-02 00:51:59
Namely you banned me 11 times so I had to register 12 accounts.
Namely you feel that negative opinions about this fake torrent called Bitcoin are illegitimate to have.
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:15:07
Nobel Prize Winner in Economics vs dumb teens who say When Moon 
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:04:04
That is the intrinsic value then. Scary
@_date: 2018-07-31 04:25:34
Gold can be used as a metal.
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:24:07
I can show you how you can Lose money with bitcoin:
You buy it with money, and later it goes to zero.
@_date: 2018-07-31 12:50:11
Yeah but if you can smuggle a Used Piece of Toilet Tissue through the metal detector, then yes it set off less alarms than a golden brick.
But at the end you have Nothing, and you have smuggled Nothing, and that is why bitcoin is worthless.
"Convenience" and is like a multiplier of value, so 0 x 5 = $0.
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:17:57
That sounds like value actually. Avoiding harm from guns = $$$.
@_date: 2018-07-31 03:28:56
But the price for that cartography is $0.
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:41:49
Initially Bitcoin became famous as a get-rich-quick scheme, but starting 2018 its brand has come to mean: Quick Poverty.
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:38:19
Did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto is rearranged letters for: "So, a man took a shit."
Yes, that is what you have put your life savings into.
@_date: 2018-07-31 02:16:50
Have fun riding it down to zero
