Great idea and allot of good suggestions on which fighter should be sponsored.
If sponsoring a fighter becomes a reality, and I am definitely contributing to this, we shouldn't just pick a fighter on personal preferences. My favorite fighter is [Donald Cerrone]( and a great finisher, but also a very high profiled fighter, which will "cost" a great deal.
If we choose [Chael Sonnen]( we get (arguably) one of the best fight promoters since Muhammad Ali, and a great spokes person. Will also cost, and probably hard to get to.
If we think choosing a fighter based on income, [this]( is a list of the fighters purse(income) from the latest UFC event 172. From lists like this, we could choose a less paid but up-and-coming fighter to promote.
Bottom line is that we want press and attention arround this. Fighters like Gunnar Nelson are awesome, and Iceland "fits the bill" crypto currencie-wise (Auroracoin), he isn't really a great promoter. 
I would actually like to see a Woman fighter being promoted. They just got into the UFC, often fight harder than the men, are a trending "subject" in the community, would probably get great press and we would be helping even lesser paid fighters getting promoted. As there are so few female fighters, one could be a nobody coming up to a fight, and if she beats [Ronda Rousey]( she'll be a superstar over night. 
[Miesha Tate]( is hot, humble, and next inline to fight for the championship.
Whoever we choose to support, I'm personally totally down on idea. Awesome suggestion!
