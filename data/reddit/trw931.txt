I've been using this app for a while, I honestly have never had a problem with about 50 transactions.

I love the cash app and tested this out with 500 dollars yesterday after using the app for a long time. Beware, while there are no fees, they essentially charge you by giving you a higher price when you buy and a lower price when you sell. In fact I bought 500 and my sellable balance was immediately 488, so it's about 1 percent each way. This is not favorable.
Edit: fixed math

Good chance it will drop soon. But I had that thought when I bought in at the first 5k. I decided I believed in the technology and bought in anyway. Even though it immediately dropped nearly 50 percent, it ended up not being to late in the scheme of things

Look into gbtc. I own 6 shares in my IRA which is equivalent to nearly .6 Bitcoin. It is sold at a premium, but you get the benefits of it being tax free with correct withdrawal.

It is when it comes to the btc, the fork distributions have been inconsistent at best. There were a lot of complaints on how they distributed the last small fork.
I've owned gbtc since September. I sold at the highs and bought back in as it fell to make my initial investment back. Now I'm just holding on long term.

I bought at 5k, then it got 3k. Now it's 10k

He did not give Bitcoin to the pizza shop. He transferred them to an individual who went through the normal order process for pizza, and sent it to the guys address.

You are choosing to define the constant as Bitcoin. You could do the opposite.  $700/1BTC NOW 700$/.127BTC JUST LOOK AT THE CONSTANT

Lol we have almost identical portfolios. I have very similar investments with just over 600 gbtc. The returns have been incredible

I've held gbtc in a tax advantaged account for almost 2 years. If you want to be involved with bitcoin through traditional stock trading platforms this is one way to do it, but you do not own bitcoin. The value of the trust is a premium over the asset the trust holds, which is bitcoin. There is an annual fee as well that decreased the amount of bitcoin held per share which is considered high.
The reason people accept the premium and it fluctuates is just another layer of speculation. There premium is high at the moment, because sentiment is high, but if the asset starts to crash then the gbtc crash will likely be more intense.
