Thank you for your comment. I will check out Open Bazaar first. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 01:02:49
It's not open yet but I will make sure to keep a eye out for it. Hopefully I can sell things from here in S. Korea on there.
@_date: 2015-12-26 01:01:27
Yes, I will wait. I will sell my backup mobile batteries and other items I can get from here in S. Korea. I want to dedicate time in 2016 building a Bitcoin income and keep all my profits in Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:20:55
Wow,  great answer. Thank you. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 00:20:48
Thank you. I wrote that down. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 02:31:41
Thank you.

In one aspect you can say that. I live here in S. Korea and they have so many sock designers here. Then there are people in the States regular people and professionals who might be interested in a unique way to keep relationships going when they aren't physically present. So, I came up with my business out of wanting to help sock designers here in S. Korea and people who want to show they care with my socks. Then Bitcoin helps me out with not having to deal with two different currencies in transactions because then I only have to deal with one currency after Bitcoin users pay with the coin.

Are you talking about doing this on my blog section of my website?
@_date: 2015-12-27 14:01:23
Thank you. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:11:17
Lol...This made me laugh so hard. I hope you made him a millionaire too. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 00:41:50
Thank you and good one. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 05:02:06
How did you come up with that?
@_date: 2015-12-26 05:03:31
Right now, I started the business in Aug of 2015. So, it's still in the starting phase. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 09:50:36
Thank you and you can follow my YouTube channel at  for updates. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 09:50:44
Thank you. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 23:40:06
Yes, I am. Slow growth for long time existence. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 07:07:09
Got it and thank you for the sound advice. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 01:04:25
Yeah, I am going to wait for Open Bazaar too. Going to try to move some S. Korean goods on there.

Hello frankenmint,
I like your duel diligence in my idea. Yes, I have a twitter, Facebook, and instagram account for Hana Suit. I created them with my friends earlier this year because we had hopes of this replacing our current full time jobs. Then things happen with our full time employer that made us stop everything.
Now, I did make a video with one of my partners talking about the differences in materials. I can make a post with that video. 
Keep in mind...I am slowly getting the ball moving to kickstart Hana Suit again. I do plan on cleaning up the social links and building a better website. In the meantime, I am focusing on building up trust among the crypto currency community. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 04:37:02
Thank you for your feedback. I wrote this post and there is a link in my post to my coming soon page. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 21:21:18
I am thinking of using Pozible.com because they accept Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:29:36
Yeah but nobody is paying me to do so. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 12:01:24
Good luck and I will follow the blog. Do you still have that scraper bot(s)? 
@_date: 2014-05-13 11:52:20
Yes, please share with me.

I like brick and mortar stores but keep in mind these stores retail price is higher because they have a store. Some don't make clients suits from the ground up. They just adjust pre-made suits for a ridiculous price. Also, how many brick and mortars accept cryptocurrency? 
@_date: 2014-10-19 21:09:02
Hello jan,
I can understand who you don't get crowdfunding. I was like you once until I supported about 3 successful campaigns myself. People who support these campaigns usual are offered a perk that you won't be able to get once the business is fully up and running. It also helps people see if their concept is even needed in the market; therefore, eliminating a business person from wasting a large amount of start up capital. 
In my article I am putting out my business concept. Now I welcome you to pay someone in the States but keep in mind other online suit tailors outsource their orders to China or Thailand. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 22:08:56
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2014-10-21 04:17:24
Thanks for the links for me to get engaged in.
@_date: 2014-10-19 21:19:05
Thanks for your support.

@_date: 2016-01-07 21:14:38
Yes, you are right...We just have to ignore them. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 23:11:26
Banks investing into the blockchain seems like it goes against what Bitcoin and the blockchain was made for. It suppose to take the power out of the bank hands and give it to all people.
@_date: 2016-01-11 08:31:26
I am actually in that meetup group already. I can make the weekday meetups right now because I stay to far from Seoul. I am hoping to be able to come up to Seoul this weekend and I would love to interview some of you. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 11:08:20
Well, I am hoping to make the meetup for Bitcoin Center Korea this Friday. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:31:25
I will have to checkout BitWage.
@_date: 2016-01-24 08:45:09
Yeah, I am getting rid of stuff to make my life less clutter and at the same time invest more into Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 08:25:51
They have a wine-tasting this Friday I believe at the center this Friday.
@_date: 2016-01-03 14:09:40
Great! Contact me when you are up.
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:02:55
Thank your comment. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:14:58
Hello and yes I am here in Korea. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 08:46:58
Well Ebay gave me a free to list coupon, so I don't have to pay that crazy fee. 
I am looking forward to OpenBazaar going full launch and I come up with a game plan. My sock company currently use Coinbase merchant tools to sell socks on my site 
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:03:53
Nice comment and thank you for commenting. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:38:57
This is a cool node to have. I will put this on my wishlist. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:01:46
Isn't t one of the goals to get more people to use Bitcoin for as many goods and services  as possible. Isn't it a goal to get businesses to start excepting it more? 
@_date: 2016-01-03 19:11:11
Thank you but unfortunately I already got the work done. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:49:46

As of right now I budget to invest $200-$400 a month of my income into Bitcoin. Who else does anything similar? 
@_date: 2016-01-08 11:05:28
Other than the fact I am just a simple business person working to add myself to the other business people out there, I guess no advantage really. The same can be said for coffee shops, food trucks, the Bitcoin Center in Korea I went to who also accepts Bitcoin there isn't a advantage. Bitcoin was design to replace the fiat currency that is used everyday right now to buy socks, coffee, food, and donate to community centers...The main advantage of Bitcoin is to take the power of money out of central banks and governments hands. The advantage of Bitcoin for entrepreneurs who are trying to create a whole market for people who has plans to live off of bitcoin, to be able to purchase goods and services. I'm not trying to please every consumer because that's a impossible task.   
@_date: 2016-01-23 04:54:46
I sure do. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 19:10:09
Let me suggest you learn about...Thank you for your 2 cents and  have a nice day.

That's a nice shirt but I might be able to do something similar.
