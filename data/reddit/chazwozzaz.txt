true dat. im racking my brains on what to do with all my spare power. like today. 2.4kW going straight out to the grid. I'm getting paid for generating it regardless of if I use it or not ... so I prefer to use it. Right now I consider it to be wasted.

Hey thanks, I've actually already done this. I built a quick arduino rig that can show me input power from the solar pv vs what i'm using right now.. and I hooked in a relay to kick in when I have over X amount of watts spare which I use to turn a heater on mostly but would work great for this too. :)
edit: here is version 2. that i'm working on using a pi zero w so i can easily do stats over web server. bought a solid state relay to replace the magnetic one with too.

woah thats new to me, i thought the S9 was the fastest thing on the market. These are interesting. thanks

I should mention im in the UK and we don't do net metering. The way it works for me is I get 14p per kWh produced, wether I used it myself or exported it... then an extra 5p if I export it. However there's no export meter so they just assume 50% is exported. During summer it's way more than 50% exported... during winter it's way less. However, because they just guess that you export 50% of it I could generate and use 100% of my energy and still get paid the same.
not much to tell really I installed it when I bought the house 4 years ago, I have 12 335W sunedison panels and a sunny boy SMA 4000TL grid tie inverter. 
I bought it because I run my own business and work at home, so I'm in during the day time and I put all my appliances on during the day in stages, first dishwasher, then washer, then dryer if needed.
I usually find that during the day time, a lot of my energy just goes straight out the pipe and is used up probably by my neighbours. 
I divert excess energy into a 300L water heater, and even then I still have free power. Today, I've generated 18kWh and about 8kWh has been exported because I couldn't use it, and that's after having run all my usual appliances and running an electric heater all day. 
It's freezing cold here today (-1 C) and yet I'm getting free heat and hot water because despite being cold it's super sunny today in London.

sure I agree. but also over the lifetime (20 years supposedly) that my system should provide power I will be giving a lot back to the grid makes me smile sometimes when I know my neighbours are using power I produced... but for the short lifespan of an s9 miner (what 1-2 years?) I'll take some profit since I'm getting paid the same. I've made 11 MegaWatts since 2014 and about 5-6 of that I've used and the rest has gone to the grid :)

$3,156.65 total price. nah. never mind.

They do yeah. I get £0.14 per kWh generated and an extra £0.05 on 50% of that. It works out to something around £500 a year and then of course you get some free electricity on top of that / save on importing power.
