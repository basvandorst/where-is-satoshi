Sure, but you're twisting it into a false choice.  
When Zimbabwe has problems people don't go to some random niche product like Bitcoin.  People go to things that have a record of STABILITY.  The biggest enemy of a currency is volatility.  People go to Gold and Dollar and Real Estate because of stability and predictability.  Not Bitcoin.

People hiding money are going to do it abroad and it's going to be tough for the Greek government to track down these accounts.  Countries like Switzerland have made it their business to hide and protect money.  There's just too many places out there willing to do it.
The Greek government has tried using satellite imagery to catch people who are paying taxes on 1000 sq feet while living in 5000 sq feet improved with pools, etc.  But, as you can imagine, this is highly unpopular.  No one likes to pay more taxes.

I skipped around and all I heard is US Dollar, Paypal, US companies, blah, blah blah... as if you weren't even in India.  
If you're in India, you should be talking about the Indian banking, inflation, currency controls.

This idea has little to do with the problems in Greece. 
Ordinary Greeks want a big-ass bureaucracy - *expensive* bureaucracy - but they also want to avoid paying for it.  They've financed this bureaucracy on credit for many decades now, but you can only do that for so long.  It's not the government pushing "ordinary Greeks".  It's a simply tragedy of the masses, where people focused on themselves as individuals and don't give a damn about the financial stability of the system as a whole.  All democracies do this to various levels.  
What does bitcoin have to do with any of this?  Pretty much nothing.  Greeks have been hiding their money for 50 years and they don't need Bitcoin to do it.  And the government can always tax real property - houses/cars/etc.

Go try and buy a decent amount of foreign currency or invest in a foreign market and you will find just how much fuck Indian government does, indeed, give.  Part of the reason why Indians have so much gold is because they're highly restricted in their options.  It's one of the most bureaucratic, restricted, regulated and uncertain places on earth - when you actually try to do something aside from playing tourist.

Well... if Bitcoin proves to have decent stability over the course of the next 100 years - like the US dollar - then perhaps we can take a 2nd look then and reconsider?  :)  
70s inflation is -nothing- compared to the weekly ebbs and flows of Bitcoin value.  Bitcoin is basically impossible to use on any meaningful level unless you instantly ditch it (Bitpay/similar).  People might not care when buying a few hundred dollars worth of stuff, but it's a complete deal breaker on any more meaningful level.
Stability and predictability is why 1/2 the paper dollar currency is somewhere out there abroad under Russian/African/S. American mattresses.  Without stability, Bitcoin will never be taken seriously as a means of exchange.  It will only draw attention for its speculative potential.  (and enabling criminals)

Sure, I understand, but you're comparing ancient world where things spread at a snails pace because of transportation/information/etc limitations to today, where we are not hindered by these limits.  During Marco Polo's day, you could discover the fountain of youth and it would still take centuries to get around the world.  
Compare to modern tech.  One day, no one has smartphones.  10 years later, even poor people have smartphones.  Things move fast - if there is a reason to move fast and people actually want it.  
IMO, instead of pushing Bitcoin in the US, perhaps Bitcoin evangelists should be pushing Bitcoin in Venezuela/Russia/China/similar.  But even then, people don't want to keep their wealth in a currency that looses 80% of value so quickly.  Even the shitty Ruble doesn't do that.  It is estimated that about 1/2 of paper dollar currency is in foreign hands under various mattresses around the world.  Stability - this is what people need first and foremost in a currency.  And if they can't get stability, they need at least ability to move it out of the country so they can buy and store dollars. Bitcoin makes it easier to move wealth in and out of that country.  The thing is, Venezuelans/Russians/Chinese that want to move currency abroad already have various low-cost systems to do so...

If it was such a huge positive innovation it would've gained in popularity and use much quicker.  Six years later, and Bitcoin is still just a tool for speculators and those that need to facilitate their criminal transactions.  What people see as strengths are actually weaknesses holding back Bitcoin.
I would argue that M-Pesa has has a vastly greater impact than Bitcoin so far.  And something like M-Pesa will emerge from the mess of Bitcoin to make a bigger impact in the developed world.

The "establishment" told people to use things like Napster?  Hardly.  If value is easy to recognize, people are more than willing to try things and they blow up very quickly.
Trusted 3rd party is how business is done for common sense reasons, not because of some new mistrust we have been incorrectly led to cultivate.  Maybe if we had trusted 3rd parties, people would not continue to get burned by Silkroad/etc.  In fact, this is where Silicon Valley is trying to do with Bitpay/similar.  
The government keeps track of bigger financial transactions to spot illegal activity, including tax evasion.  It's easy to hide small crimes (and small money) but it's very hard to hide bigger things.  What you see as the biggest strength of Bitcoin is actually it's weakest component in the US, and developed world.

Most people don't care about credit card fraud because credit card companies cover you.  It's really not much of a problem for you.  It's a problem for them.

You're supposed to call your credit card company so they can flag your account for travel.  Otherwise, it -should- get blocked when all the sudden you start racking up charges in Albania.  
Ironically, I once had my card locked for suspicious activity right where I live, in Washington, DC, when I tried to fill my tank at a ghetto gas station.  But using it in South Africa, Namibia, Zambia, India, Thailand, Colombia, etc, etc.... never had it locked.  I always tell the bank that I'm traveling so they can flag my account.  
@_date: 2015-07-04 21:17:47
There are conflicting accounts on how important it is to make that phone call.  I know I've traveled without doing it, and my CCs worked fine.  Whenever I did make the phone call, they asked me the countries and for how long.  (it's some sort of temporary flag.)  It's more of a precaution than a necessity.  It's the same reason why I always have multiple credit cards and multiple forms of payment.  
These credit card systems work on all sorts of fraud detection software.  Depending on your purchasing history, the system might flag things that look completely out of the ordinary, compared to data of fraud instances.

Yes and no.
There's been a few cases where people were searched at the airport before they were even given the chance to declare, so technically they didn't declare.  There was a big Supreme Court case about 1 year ago where an immigrant going back to South American had  their life savings confiscated (100K-ish) because they were picked for a search when they entered Miami airport.  (But haven't filled out the declaration form.)

People seem to be blowing this off, but sentiment analysis is worth tracking.  The question is; does a particular metric affect enough to affect you?

I am one of those people who would laugh at you as well.
In part, it's because I was unaware of payment systems like Bitpay until recently, and you have mentioned nothing about the actual logistics.  When people hear Bitcoin, they think ridiculous volatility and unforeseen disclosure requirements/problems.
Don't mention Bitcoin.  Mention Bitpay/similar.  Don't describe, show.  
That said, I find it weird that your company can't wait 4 days and pay 100 bucks for a wire.  Many businesses are used to waiting 30-90 days or more to get paid and 4 days is nothing.

"People talk about how immature Bitcoin is, but the real problem is how immature so many of the users are. "
People were never tech savvy to begin with, and young people are actually getting dumber, not tech savvier, as everything moves to Iphone and Android and OS versions made for the dumbest common denominator. 
People don't want to read a manual and study up on all the intricacies of Bitcoin.  When you think about it, that's ridiculous and it should scream just how niche Bitcoin really is.

I don't think you realize just how quickly credit cards were implemented.  Initially, they just sent people who had bank accounts actual working credit cards to use.  (no applications or anything.)  The had to sign up merchants, but on the user side it was pretty frictionless.  In less than 10 years, they literally sent a working credit card to anyone who wasn't a deadbeat.  [An estimated 100,000,000 credit cards within a decade.](  (In 1970, USA population was 200M)

To me, the future of Bitcoin is not in the US.  It's in more developing countries (that have tech savvy populations), countries with high inflation, monetary problems, government restrictions.  This is how Bitcoin might succeed.

I wonder why TPB guy didn't pursue this.  Or maybe he did, but when they found out who he was the price tag went up exponentially? 
I generally agree with you that developing countries are much stricter than people make them out to be.  Especially in Asia, there are all sorts of restrictions in how foreigners can live their lives, and permanent residency - not to even mention citizenship - is a pipe dream unless you marry locally.

Because no one wants to be left with Bitcoins at the end of the day.  
Business run on real currency.  Suppliers, employees, and everyone else wants real currency.
And getting whatever Bitcoins they get from you to actual currency is a process that takes some time and transaction costs and they end up holding risk in the meantime.  I wonder how much Overstock lost.  Remember when they were hyping up accepting Bitcoins when Bitcoins were $1000+?  They might cash out Bitcoins every week or every month.  Chances are good that they got completely fleeced on this gimmick promotion.  They don't have huge margins in the inventory to eat that up.

The harder it is to find and prosecute a crime, the stiffer the punishment needs to be.  In other words, when white collar criminals do a risk/benefit analysis on whether to pursue something, 1% chance of getting 8 years is a lot easier to swallow than 1% of getting life.  This is because very few people will actually get caught.  
In contrast, many crimes are easy to solve and prosecute.  There is no need for outsized penalties.  People get punished for the crime itself.

I don't think you realize how madly expensive some of those countries are.  You're probably thinking you can live like some tribal king in Africa, but reality is that if you just want a house that has modern amenities, clean water, reliable electricity, etc - in an area where no one is going to rob you - it is often going to cost you a multiple of what it costs you in the US.
Imagine having to import all the important pieces in your house - and pay ridiculous duties on each item.  And then you have to find qualified people to install complex systems - not cheap - and things like electricity are built with redundancy.  (You essentially have 2 electrical systems, so that when main power goes down, you can live off of generator.)  Many African countries are the land of $300/night Holiday Inns and 500,000 USD houses that look pretty ordinary.  Expats in places like Zimbabwe always complain that they're living in crummy places and paying thousands of dollars to do so.  
And then, you have to worry about the wrong people in power figuring out that you have money.  10-20 million is a lot, but corrupt officials have appetites to eat much more than that pretty quickly.  
SE Asian countries are the only ones that I would take up seriously.  Although I enjoyed my time in Mozambique and Namibia, I wouldn't want to be stuck there, forever.  
That's not to say that 10-20 mil doesn't go far everywhere in the world.  But thing add up very fast if you don't live like a backpacker out of a hut with no warm water.
