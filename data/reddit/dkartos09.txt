Stellar is thriving during all of this
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:32:08
That is actually exactly what I'm expecting
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:42:36
some people who don't know what they're talking about
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:11:34
nope, not inverse. You even paying attention to what's going on?
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:12:00
raised to the moon behind a dif currency

It isn't for sure, I admit. I'm just looking at the verifying indicator of the decrease in volume as this second shoulder forms. If it is a bull market we should see an increase in volume. The volume is concerning.

@_date: 2017-06-20 19:26:07
I'm looking longterm, currently seeing it form on the daily scale. Notice how it bounced back when went to the highs of the first (left) shoulder?
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:30:11
It doesn't matter if momentum is already swinging. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:47:46
it's happening dumbass
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:19:33
so you should remember the last time you saw this pattern? I got in 2012 so I've seen a thing or two. Most people got in 2013, and the smart ones got out when they saw this pattern forming. I'm assuming you have less BTC than you started with
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:22:57
You're watching it happen. What does 'the weekend' have anything to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:44:48
Are you seeing blood yet, 'homeboy'? You should because btc is still losing value. You must be the  crypto trader though and you can see that this is actually a good time to buy. LOL, I hate being the one to say "i told you so." Are you awake yet?
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:15:30
Get out now while you still can
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:35:00
there you have it!!
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:27:42
I don't hold when I know things are bearish
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:35:04
Yeah I saw that too, this what I'm seeing is much bigger
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:36:11
good luck this week
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:05:24
Here's the blood I was talking about. It's still happening and will continue until more bitcoin accounts are created
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:22:06
Sub 2400 on polo. lol I'm loving that you are losing money. I hate being right all the time
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:21:02
Yeah, the big red flag is the decrease in volume with increasing prices on the right shoulder. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:13:36
Are you still holding??? LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:28:18
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:42:40
Do you believe me now? I sure hope you're still in so you can lose your shirt!!! It'll probably be a slow death from here, but I can't wait to buy your losses!! 
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:23:09
so you're aware of bitcoin losing global market cap then? Doesn't sound like you're diversifying
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:10:46
yet it keeps tumbling, tumbling, tumbling. I'm now 95% sure I'm right and you are losing money idiot
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:12:09
haha, this is the funniest thing I've read this week
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:31:17
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:27:16
everything is a bubble, but there is still money to be made in crypto. Just a bear market right now until it goes mainstream
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:11:09
this is different, can't you see the price falling?
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:22:20
That is a good strategy, that is, until the bubble pops
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:24:44
historically, things usually go back to the low of the first (left) shoulder. Don't worry, it's not going back to 0, just correction I believe. The crypto market has a lot left to go before anything pops
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:20:01
Are you losing money now? Haha, I told you it was the end of the right shoulder
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:35:38
there is always a bubble
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:13:22
The peak for India trading was last month, and since then there has been less buying. The airdrop will only benefit Stellar
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:17:15
not crying, just stating the facts as this is a classic case of the head &amp; shoulders patter. If you need a refresher check:
