Ok. I'm sure that things could be cheaper if there were no processing fees. But they aren't now. So, what's a financially responsible person to do? Take advantage of these cash back cards whenever the opportunity presents itself. 
That's what I do. If there's a cash or BTC discount, that's what I use. Idealism doesn't need to preclude pragmatism.

No kidding. I was there at 7:20 this morning with my 2 kids in tow and there was a line to the parking lot! Lots of dads like me had the same idea - get mom a delicious biscuit for breakfast and get out of making coffee, too. 
Unfortunately for me, I'm allergic to gluten so all I got was a lemon cake donut. It was good but nothing like their biscuits.

This is terrible advice on so many levels. Rule number 1 is don't invest more than you can afford. Rule number 2 is *diversify*. 
I get the excitement around Altcoins but if you're investing, you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket.

I've been thinking about this all day and it seems to me that Rise accepting bitcoin is a pretty big thing. 
The foodie community in Durham is a really important part of our community. People in Durham love their little local eateries and we pride ourselves on having the best local eating establishments in all of the state. I believe people in the triangle would agree that Durham is the best place in the area for these types of establishments. 
Rise is interesting because it's the first of these types of hipster-ish places in the south Durham area. Typically you'll find them downtown. Since Rise opened a couple of years ago, you can feel the palpable excitement about places like it in the usually big-box stomping ground of the mall area. People from Cary are asking Rise to open in their area! Anyway, it's a very popular and influential place in Durham. 
I bet our wonderful locally owned coffeeshops would be interested to hear about how it's going for them. Once the BTC to USD volatility dies down, I bet we'll see wider acceptance. I'm a psychologist and I'd love to accept BTC from my patients. But there's no way I could reasonably do that until I can feel sure that if I go to bed without making the transfer to USD, my money wouldn't lose 30% overnight. Yes, it could also gain that much, but as anyone who studies the psychology of gain and loss, it hurts way worse to lose money you thought you had than to miss some potential unrealized gains. 
What do you all think? Will BTC be more widely accepted once it's volatility does down? That necessarily means it won't be as interesting a news story, but currency is supposed to be boring!

I figured it out! Every time I have bitcoin someplace, it goes down. This time, I got smart and transferred it out of localbitcoins to my own wallet immediately after getting them. Bullet dodged.

Thanks! It's face-to-face and I've dealt with this particular seller before so I'm comfortable with him. 
After I get the BTC in my wallet, sending it out is as simple as getting the receiving address? Are confirmations on the blockchain or something like that? Basically, how do I avoid screwing up the sending and receiving process? 
@_date: 2014-05-13 00:29:17
Why is it either/or? I don't understand the false choice you're presenting.  
If I started taking BTC at my business and could use it to buy stuff I need, I'd feel much better about the currency. That leads to stability, which is what a currency needs.
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:33:00
Got it all sorted out! Thanks for the quick help, guys.
Now, is it advisable to create an offline wallet or is one on my computer "good enough"? 
@_date: 2014-09-07 11:10:35
Except it's not if you pay your full balance on time and don't use it on things you wouldn't buy normally. 
I've been using my Amex card this way for years and it's saved me thousands of dollars. Yes, saved, because I've got to buy groceries and gas and clothing and pay my cell phone and water bills. Does Amex know a crap ton about me and my purchases? Yep. If I'm doing something I don't want them to know about, there are other means. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 11:52:57

Wow. Such helpful. 
If you guys want to have BTC take off, you really ought to be more helpful. 
To extend my comment - use cash and store where? What if I want to go online? Tumbling where? Etc
Mind you, I know the answers to these questions but I bet there are an order or two of magnitude of people reading these threads now and in the future who might want to know.

I took my kids on a biscuit run this morning for Mother's Day and I saw one of the workers wearing this t-shirt. Apologies for the quality - I didn't want to seem weird by asking the employee if I could take a photo of his shirt! The place was really busy and I'm sure hundreds of people saw the shirt. 
I didn't get a chance to ask how they take payments because hungry kids but if I go by when they are slower, I will.

I have no dog in this fight. But you said "any bank" lets you generate temporary numbers. I don't use Bank of America and almost exclusively use my Amex card. Neither Visa nor MasterCard have this service you speak of. 
Personally, I don't care either way.

@_date: 2015-01-10 01:04:34
You guys are unreal. 
- we've had someone defending child porn as a possible way to reduce child abuse. 
- Someone else equating having a marketplace for drugs, fake ids, porn, weapons and pirated goods as a deed as noble as hiding Jews from the nazis and slaves from slavers. 
Have you guys ever looked at how comical you are? This is just embarrassing. 
Aside from the absurdity of these crazy ass arguments, I'm completely unclear how making millions from this marketplace is a moral act.

This line of reasoning/argument needs to stop. There's has never been, in any of our lifetimes, a period where the dollar lost 80% of its value in a year. It's absurd to think that a family or business could rely on Bitcoin without chain gig over to fiat immediately now or any time in the near future. Sorry. 
The darknet vendors are loving it because without BTC, the darknet would not be possible. But even they convert to fiat immediately. 
And I know I'm going to karma hell for this post but you guys need to get your heads out of the clouds and solve the problems facing BTC rather than make these fallacious comparisons. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:28:17
I'm not saying it's a forever strategy but it's safe. Some speculation is fine but betting houses and cars and life savings like some here seem to promote? That's just nuts.

If there were no credit card fees? What world are you living in? I'm living in the one where my milk costs $3.99/gallon and my gas costs me $75/tank. 
I don't pay those fees. And you can't prove that anything would be cheaper sans credit cards. Could they be? Sure but they could also be more expensive because people would have less purchasing power. 
Anything is possible in a world of hypotheticals. I'm talking about practical matters. But you try living in the world as it "should be". Meanwhile, the rest of us are trying to live in the world that is.

Umm no. We all hear about inflation and deflation in 9th grade Econ class. We all hear our parents gripe about how much gas costs nowadays. We know that inflation is a real thing. But not like BTC. What's happening there is off the charts. 
It needs to be fixed or it's going nowhere fast.

Screw that. He was a businessman making some good money. He got caught. If he were this paragon of virtue he should have plowed that dough into causes and for candidates that prompted those ideals. 
But he didn't. 
He broke the law. There are consequences for that. I'm not sure what the debate is here. 
Also I don't know why so many of you view Bitcoin as some sort of political movement and why you think that's going to spur mass adoption. 
Some of us are just interested in how easy it is to transact with. I have no interest in overthrowing the banking system or the government. 
I would like PayPal to fire in a fire, though.

In a nutshell, candles are the price action in a given period. The wicks of the candle (the lines up and down from the body) are the range of the price during that period. The body of the candle (the fat part) indicates where the price opened and closed that period. A green candle means the price is higher at the end of the period and a red candle means it is lower. 
When you see a long wick up and a fat body well below it it means there’s still lots of selling pressure. Lower highs is just a bearish single overall. 
Keep in mind that this is a one minute chart and no one but day-trading options guys should be using them. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:28:45
That is not a bullish pattern. Long wicks with even on the up days. Setting lower highs. Beware guys. 
I’m *not* saying it’s the end, but you need to look at this as a long term deal. You can’t sweat the day-to-day price. 
ETA: this is the one-minute chart?!? Jesus. Guys. Back away from the computer screen. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:44:53
Great. But you don’t act until there’s that big green candle. Hindsight is 20/20 and all that. Without a crystal ball, you should not be viewing the candles on the chart in the OP as a buy signal.
