Thanks, this is not something you should be taking serious concerns about, but I appreciate greatly what you want to accomplish. This is supposed to be funny as what others have thought as well.

Bitcoin is rising back up, maybe you wanna take up the opportunity to gain your losses back if you do it properly this time around?

See anything can compete with BTC but nothing can level with it, that's the thing you guys mumbling about. Yeah we all know BTC's superiority obviously
@_date: 2019-05-28 14:11:28
Every single Crypto can compete with Bitcoin, maybe level with Bitcoin is something of a discussion. Every single thing can be made something else and diversified. Bitcoin is nothing special despite it's reputation. Don't speak too soon or you might end up swallowing these words.
