imo once a company has been reported as scam it’s going to be hard to wash off the dirt. Especially if multiple of people are reporting.
They offer nothing special.
You can purchase your gift cards via gyft.
You can buy BTC by card or ach at coinbase or ATM or localbitcoins.
You can use Electrum or Breadwallet for your wallets.

You have a business account to do business transactions &amp; you do personal transactions on your personal account.
Why would you be paying taxes on stuff that is personal not business makes no sense.
If your account is frozen, after a certain period of time they mail you a check or perhaps you can arrange it to pick it up. 
Buying stuff from coinbase with money earned from 100% online business sounds suspicious. Provide proof of your earnings and you’ll see that they’ll unfreeze it.
They are requesting extra information to make sure you are not funding terrorist, etc. 
What’s the problem with providing them the information they need?
It’s not that they closed your account...
fyi, you shouldn’t post private information on the internet.

Using a business account for personal reasons can cause problems.
For a business account for coinbase will raise red flags.
Use your personal account, you shouldn’t have a problem.
Also what’s your deposit boa to coinbase charge ratio?

Look at how the forex bots work, would imagine it’ll be something similar.

Why not atm or localbitcoins? It’s about 10% difference.

No thank you, 
If you sell at coinbase it sells for $2729
If you buy at coinbase it buys for $2756
I buy at 75-60% from coinbase sells price. Which would make it $2,046-$1,635. Depending on how you want to receive payment. 
Let me know.

How did you pay?
@_date: 2017-07-21 06:32:57
If you would just scroll or use the search function keywords coinbase August 1. And actually tried to search you would find multiple of opinions and discussions about it.
Overall: About 99% recommends on owning your private keys. 
Point is coinbase is limiting you for whatever reason. 
Using your own wallet that you truly control is in your best interest.

Most ATMs have a sticker on it with contact info, even when printing the receipt it includes contact info.
Have you tried localbitcoins? They have stuff as easy as going into the bank and cash deposit or buying gift cards.
@_date: 2017-07-21 06:23:25
From my understanding and searching around using keywords such as &lt;bank name&gt; bitcoin coinbase 
Some banks don’t really bother to much unless it’s large amounts coming in and out. A “large” amount is a variable.
If the funds that get deposited into the bank account from a BTC transaction would stay in the account for at least 30 days with no less then 5% taken out. After the 30 days, start withdrawing in percentages(10-25) and wait another 14-30 days for next withdrawal. While maintaining a balance, keep depositing but keep the schedule the same.
Allowing the banks to make something out of this and it’ll lower your risk rate. 
Having multiple of accounts with the bank is also a great idea. 
Example: Open line of credit, use funds to pay off and use credit for daily activities.
Basically allow them to make money and don’t complain about it. Become a loyal and valued customer. Have all your tax documentations ready and you shouldn’t have a problem.
You can also buy gift cards and minimize the headaches.
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:05:09
By customers losing money, what do you mean by this?
Do you mean as in checking account has x and because of the hack it has y now?
Banks doesn’t operate that way. All funds are insured, a standard checking account will be FDIC which is $250k. Basically you are guaranteed a safety net of $250k if anything ever goes wrong.
What will happen instead is monthly service charge increase by a $2 a month, lower interest rate on savings account, higher loan rates, etc.
A robbery can happen in multiple of ways.

@_date: 2017-07-16 06:53:59
I wouldn’t bother as the risk is higher then the reward.
If your able to meet in person for at least the first transaction then it’ll be okay for future deals.
All imo
The other party might not be a scam neither, I personally wouldn’t risk it at all.
