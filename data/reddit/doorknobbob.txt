Yeah no problem. Probably not the best sub to get a non-biased answer from since most people here refuse to acknowledge other promising alts at least according to the downvotes I've been getting.

Now ask yourself this, would you still hold bitcoin to the same standards had it tanked to $4000 and stayed there? If yes then that's the kind of attitude we need.

I have my largest holdings in Raiblocks just because transactions take 5 seconds and they are free!
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:55:08
What you’re saying is true. From personal experience i’ve lost more day trading than holding, but I probably suck and you don’t. Timing the market is extremely difficult and hindsight is always 2020. When you look back at CBOE opening futures and you see a huge dip right before it’s easy to say, “Of course it was going to dip!” But what if it didn’t? What if it shot up to $25k and stayed there and then shot up more after futures opened? Well then you just lost out on all these gains. If you think you can accurately predict the market and make money then by all means go for it. It works for you, but it doesn’t work for the majority of the people. There are bots out there that can predict trends 10x more accurately than we can, and professional day traders do use them. People on either A) want you to hodl because day trading results in a loss the majority of the times or B) simply want you to stay in because they have something to gain themselves.
TLDR: You have a much higher chance of making money holding than trying to predict the market. This applies to anything in this world but especially bitcoin which is much more unpredectable than regular assets

Hey yeah it did! ViaBTC only accepts 100 free accelerations per hour so be sure to submit on the hour. It was cleared within 2 hours.
Edit: Oops I didn't notice you were the same person who recommended it to me. Thanks again!

I was trolling man sorry I didn't expect so many people to respond. I wish I had 230 bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:07:52
It's digital currency. We assign it value, and that value can be sent across the world to buy things. That's what Bitcoin is in a nutshell
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:13:24
Sold at 16.6k to buy IOTA/XRB, no regrets.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:16:51
BCH has a lot of support from Asia and is meant to be more economical to use in daily transactions (fast and low fees). Bitcoin is more like a store of value, but developers are working on Lightning Network to also make it compatible to use in every day spendings like BCH. Some people will compare Bitcoin to gold and BCH to the dollar. I personally don't like Bitcoin Cash due to the people behind it. To me, they seem very deceptive and arrogant. However, I hold both. Making money has a higher priority than pride for me.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:37:34
Look into IOTA :p

Most people I know that are investing $100-$500 have absolutely no idea what the basics and fundamentals of cryptocurrency are
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:58:35
I mean after futures open, it's been generally the same for the past 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:14:36
Delta. I just downloaded it the other day. I have Blockfolio and Crypto Pro as well. Delta has more coins, is more user-friendly, and they are coming out with a desktop version soon that lets you sync from desktop to mobile.

Personally, I call a lot of decently accurate shots but tend to hodl more than I actively trade due to the chance of me being wrong. It's less stressful, and I'm always up at the end of the day.

I bought them on Binance

Why on earth would you want to buy Bitcoin as its rising in price? You ALWAYS buy when its low.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:26:01
The transaction came from my ledger wallet to an exchange. Should I just resend the original amount with higher fees? Will this work even though the total amount is larger because of the fee?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:57:56
Stop taking this shit for granted like it's supposed to go up 15% every day. Be happy you're seeing 2000% a year and even much more in other alts instead of the ~10% from our current bull stock market

@_date: 2017-12-10 14:29:20
If you bought into bitcoin then I assume you expected it to be worth something in the future. You believed in the technology. So why no hold? If you bought it to make a quick buck without understanding it then it doesn't make a difference.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:26:57

When OP posted this it was like at a 15% drop. Now it's down 25% in a 24hr span. We saw more than 30% one month ago.

I'm still pretty nervous about this dip, where's the best place to sell 230 BTC???
Edit: I was joking. I wish I had 230 BTC. I'm a veteran redditor just made this as a throwaway account today.

Yah luck has a lot to do with it. I agree it's all human behavior but that's insanely hard to predict. I minored in psych and am in my 3rd year of med school with an interest in psych and this shit still doesn't make sense.

Ok whatever still doesn't compare to the returns from ANY coin at the beginning of this year
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:15:09
Yeah I do sorry, you bought last month at $6000 and now it's down to $15,000 from its $19,500 peak? You only more than doubled your money in 5 weeks? 
Please, man, this whole market is insane. Some coins are doing 1000% in a week. Historically that's 100 years in the stock market compiled into one week. Be happy we're seeing such massive returns and stop complaining about 20% drops.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:24:17
It was a playful joke, just wondering if these numbers had any statistics backing it or if you just pulled them out of the hopes and dreams bag you have in your ass

Yes, but that wouldn't stop them from banning exchanges and transactions made with bitcoin or even making them illegal to own

Third theory: Lots of new weak hands are experiencing their first correction + FUD from CBOE futures opening up tomorrow = perfect recipe for this dip. That and stop losses being triggered are the reason imo

Go to viabtc.com. Use their accelerator tool. Type in your transaction ID, the captcha, and hit submit **ON THE HOUR**. They only accept 100 free accelerations/hour, so you want to make sure you're one of the first ones. 
Source: Did this a couple days ago when my transaction was suck after 10 days due to mistakenly sending a very small fee.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:23:10
