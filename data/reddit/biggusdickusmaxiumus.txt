I want to add my name to this historic thread, and the death of BCash.
My name is Michael Caine.  Not a lot of people know that.
(I'm actually Craig Wright..)
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:02:30
Agreed.  Worth the same as BTG.  (Which I have nothing against - it has never been stupid enough to claim to be BTC.)
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:23:48
Here's a thought.
Mine M0nero.  
Earn money.
Use the spare GPU power to play PC games with fast frame rates.
Warm your cannabis plants!
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:29:06
I'm not sure whether that was ironic.  But I do know that individuals like myself, who have a deep distaste for BCash - due to its dishonesty - are accused of being paid, and other such nonsense.
I just want to see it die.  Like all other lies.  And that is a deeply human, and personal feeling.
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:17:18
BCash is dead.  Please PM me when it falls below 0.100
- actually,don't, I'll be having a party.

YOU have completely disregarded my excellent poem about Roger Ver.
Do you realise how many minutes of work I put into this?
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:23:35
O.K.  I can do post-modern non rhyming shit too.  It will take me about 6 minutes though.  Stand by..
@_date: 2018-03-10 15:44:18
If I write to bitcoin.com, do you think I could ask Roger for a photo of himself with 'cunt' written on his forehead?
I'm going to ask.
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:01:37
@_date: 2018-03-10 14:54:17
My Mom doesn't trust Ver: she doesn't like his darting eyes and puny shoulders.
(that's why she married Dad - a blind weightlifter.)
p.s. she can also tell when people are lying - that little hand goes up to the face when they say 'I didn't sell any...'
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:25:44
Nah.  
Only the honest ones with great technology behind them survive.  I count about 10.
Might have missed your irony tho.  :)
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:28:09
A pretty devastating critique.  
It should be widely read.
The lunatics are no longer in charge of  the asylum.
Could someone un-banned from their lying r/btc please post it there (oh yes, they do ban people - they even lie about censorship.)
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:49:54
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:47:55
I don't mind ANY coin making some progress on BTC as long as it is an HONEST coin - Monero is a contender in the long run.
But attempting to steal the BTC brand, as BCash has been doing, is an absolute disgrace.
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:44:58
Usage is actually a poor measure of value.  
Value is based mainly upon trust. The usage then follows.
This is why an altcoin called B-Cash continues to fall in value - the trust simply isn't there.
And BTW, apologies to go a little off-topic, but they accuse this honest reddit of censorship.  
I have been banned twice from r/btc (aka r/bcash) - they either do it on a technicality (e.g. using the term BCash - 'another coin' - they claim.) or without reason (probably me being objectionable to their lying.)  
Fair enough - but even their 'we do not censor' is just another lie.
They can't stop lying - because that is their sole basis.
Edit: tidied up a little.  But before any responses.
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:29:57
I think this post is being removed.
Over-keen.  
If r/A is about A, and I write about the effect of B on A, how is that off topic?

Joe and Stacy, as far as I know, don't use stocks, bonds, gold, or the blockchain to buy a coffee.
Only your leader, Dodger Ver, who is obsessed with coffee (unavailable in prison) is obsessed with this concept.
This is the death of BCash, and it cannot come sooner, for the sake of the entire community.
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:24:05
Exactly.  And market sentiment, in the long-term, is mainly based upon reputation - which is closely allied to the concept of decentralisation.  And trust :)
Edit: added a comma.
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:34:40
Here goes:
Hail!  The bear and the bird summoned a man called Roger
From whence came twattishness.
He backed a coin, a coin of gold that when bitten tasted of pooh
Was that you, said a man called Craig - whose short name was not from the farthest east.
From whence did you wankers come?
Expensive islands said they.
That took me 4 minutes.  250 BCash plz.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:20:42
Seriously.  
This price dip and confusion now has an explanation.  
So the price will take off again.  
I can see 30k by December.
I can also see BCH below 1k* within a month, and a number of shitcoins / altcoins falling under the wheels.  Which they probably deserve.
Ether will hold fairly steady, BTC monotonously climb.  Watch out for Monero - a potential big beast - but I see no others.
Edit: *hmm, already close!  Let's say &lt; 0.06 BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:54:18
There once was a man called Roger
Who thought he was a bit of a dodger
He backed B-Cash
Which turned out to be trash
With a value as small as his todger.
(I assume limericks are accepted.  What's the reward please?)
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:46:22
Not at all, but I think that is extremely unlikely.
I honestly can only see a climb once these matters are resolved.
It may take days, weeks - but I doubt months.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:54:24
It is very quiet over at r/btc regarding this - you know, the lying site.
There is the odd loony shilling about litecoin..?
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:38:17
I told you it would pump.
Here it goes.
@_date: 2018-03-10 15:39:36
Hmm.  Fair point, but noise wouldn't bother me much.
Makes sense to mine rather than heat an apartment I think in my case.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:06:15
Not a problem at all.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:50:10
I love the project.  Simple reasons: studied the tech and the utility.
Thought about buying.  Went on their reddit and started asking about their future price performance.
They showed no interest at all :)
They believe in their coin.  Completely honest (whatever its uses may be.)
I bought heavily into it a day later, after doing some more research.
Crypto is plummeting - temporarily - but the least plummeted - Monero.
Disclosure: I am 20% Monero.
Two definitely honest coins: BTC and Monero - 80: 20 not a bad speculation IMO.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:36:06
Yes, but because of the clumsiness of Monero at the present time, it is at a great price.
It is a hodling currency without doubt - great tech, clever people, completely honest and decentralised - what more would you want?
(disclaimer: I am 20% in on Monero.)
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:34:06
Well, you could put it on the blockchain as a guarantee.  
@_date: 2018-03-10 15:40:55
Oh oh: ICO: TomatoCoin :)
Get Ver behind it, it will become the REAL Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:22:17
I forgot to add: value is 90% based on TRUST.
TRUST and reputation is everything.
That is why BCash, and a large number of altcoins will fail.
A few will sustain their value - but not rise.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:06:23
Don't be silly.  Are you one of those folks living in a bunker surrounded by packs of dried food, water bottles, knives and rifles?
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:36:54
I know.  But I will never get the exchange price.
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:01:27
Lightning is pure genius.  Who cares about price when this sort of tech is being introduced to the blockchain?
BTC is here to stay.
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:14:02
In complete agreement.  
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:31:33
Not too complicated for the immense and diverse team behind BTC from its inception.
You may be thinking of liars and quick-spittles trying to pump and Ver-dump to make a quick profit.
I think those days are over.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:57:08
Store of value?
No, much more than that.  
Not just a great and trusted store of value, but millions of times more fungible than gold.
I don't care about the price - but it will be huge.
And good-bye to the BCash liars and market disruptors.
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:13:00
..this is why all of your analyses are pointless.  And why everyone should hodl BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:01:59
BTC + amazing LN progress.  BTC will climb.
But much more important to me than this, - I want to see BCash stick its nasty lying face in the mud, and be priced like the shitcoin it is.  Approx 100 USD like BTG.
Sorry for the venting.
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:19:13
Of course.  
And BTC is more saleable than gold.  Even now.
Here's an example and a challenge:  I own 1 oz of gold - a nugget in my pocket.  
Tell me how to sell it or use it now, without losing a very large percentage of its 'market' value?
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:25:43
What has gender got the fuck to do with crypto?
Completely irrelevant.
- and it also ruined Ghostbusters, but that is a separate issue I have yet to recover from.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:28:17
(btw, when I say legitimate, I don't mean Mt Gox necessarily was - I mean that the people employed to clean up the mess probably have a responsibility to sell at the best price, and use the market accordingly.  30k by end of year.)
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:07:09
Coin value is based almost completely upon TRUST.
BCash has no credibility in this regard.
It is finished, and Ver knows it (he has stopped pumping it)
But he - according to is own accounts - hasn't sold more than a dozen BTC.
So he's cool.  He's made money.  And still hodl's all his BTC.
So that is it.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:33:37
Yes.  Because despite what the FUDers say - it supports the entire market, and probably always will.
If BTC fails, that implies that the entire cryptomarket will fail - and i think that highly unlikely.
The BCash shills and liars talk about the irrelevance of 'digital gold' - well that is what BTC is evolving into.  And it will not be shifted - for decades at least.  There are game-theory and solid economic arguments for that.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:54:17


Nonsense.  
People should invest in what they are willing to risk.  Or, more conservatively, what they can afford to lose (whatever that means!)
People invest in expensive cars without understanding how the fuel injection system - or indeed any other engine system in the vehicle works.  Are they making a mistake - or trusting in a technology?
IMO, an arrogant article that gives people insufficient credit for their decisions.
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:08:30
I am part of the conspiracy.  I know this - remember our meeting - fellow conspirator.  Er....
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:28:41
As long as you have your seed, you're cool.
I keep it written down in 2 secure places, and on two hard encrypted USBs.
I use a 25th word as an extra layer which isn't written down anywhere.
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:36:06
Indeed.  It would go to 'cash for gold' and similar businesses.
Too small to sell - too large to use.
BTC suffers none of these problems.
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:20:53
I must have spent quite a bit of money heating my apartment over the past very cold 3 cold winter months.  
Using a 1kW heater.
Joule heating - electrical energy directly to heat.  Massive entropy increase.  That's it.
I could have been mining coins with that 1 kW to earn some money, decrease information entropy, and warm my apartment instead :)
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:04:43
Current price is not affected by mining, or even on USAGE (heh, don't tell the BCash shills that - they don't understand.)
