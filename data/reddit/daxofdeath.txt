I think the thing that will really get changetip rolling is integration into sites that are associated with *different kinds of nerds* - for example, and I know this has been talked about, changetip on soundcloud?  dear god.  being an indie musician has become a totally different and exciting profession - fuck marketing, fuck worrying about distribution or if people are pirating your stuff.  You can just put it out there and then ...keep doing it!

well luckily these are all companies I'd be dealing with, not individuals - if it were individuals I'm not sure I'd bother, but I think companies are more likely to remit a payment made in error.

Weird thing about this run for me...usually when btc is up, everything is up, but most in the top 10 are in the red now - not overall of course but for the momet which is still not usual. What’s that about?

nice, they look pretty good, and $10 a year!  Are you using them?

I did a similar thing but it was several years ago when what I lost (by sending to a wrong address) was not a significant amount of value. 
Now it is. But what can be done? It’s a lesson and that’s all it can be. I’m sure a lot of people have a similar story..
