This sounds extremely legit to me...thank you for such a detailed response.  It’s very interesting to watch this ‘transformation’ take place...and it’s my hope that eventually, somehow, there’s a system put in place where the few higher ups don’t have this type of power.  Absolute power, as they say, corrupts, absolutely.  I really hope blockchain tech make that less of an issue 
@_date: 2018-08-23 07:18:29
I agree. The future implementation of such a game changing type of tech is impossible to predict.  But I’d be shocked if our future generations didn’t think it was ludacris that we’d exchange our time/efforts for pieces of paper who’s value was predicated on a vestigial organ (the fed) who wasn’t even tied to our government...and who couldn’t be audited.  That seems insane to me. 
Hopefully adoption comes to those who need it’s value the most...like in Venezuela.  Time will tell.  Trusting code, to me, seems so much more compelling than trusting people at the top to do what’s best for everyone.  Time and time again, given enough power, humans do what’s best for themselves...maybe this is the equalizer 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:54:43
Actually laughed out loud to this, thank you :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:44:56
Legit didn’t mean to troll.... I just thought this scaling solution was ‘easy’ in comparison to waiting for the new tech. And I wondered if this would be their first step....evidently not 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:38:04
The Shift card is amazing.  Visa backed, zero transaction fees, and it’s only $10 to get one.  Assuming you have coins on coinbase, is the best micro transaction portal I’ve see yet.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:31:35
There’s a certain mania that’s overtaken this sub...didn’t always used to be like this. But the dramatic price increase has pushed an entirely new type of person to seek out bitcoin; overly opinionated dickheads 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:01:32
Is this real? Huge if it is 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:26:08
that was brilliant 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:03:28
Whoohooo!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:57:13
Yea agreed. I just don’t want the BCH crowd to get too ahead of themselves until core develops some clever solutions...
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:53:00
Haha, yea...see that doesn’t inspire confidence to those who want a high volume/low transaction fee sorta coin.  I think LN is the ultimate answer, but, in the interim, it seems to me that a 8mb soft fork might work well? Just a thought 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:16:53
That’s awesome man. I feel similar...and it doesn’t appear that we’re even near the moon just yet 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:13:12
Very accurate, I hope :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:49:08
agree man. It’s sad. I miss coming here for something intelligent and informed 
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:19:29
This 
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:24:21
True, and I get that. But when we go up a ton in one day, I wonder who the major contributors actually are....who’s buying? Could be a massive fleet of humans, could be a few whales? Just curious 
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:53:52
Do you have any idea how many nodes/channels it went through? Just wondering if you setup a channel just for this purchase or if the purchase routed itself though other open channels...thanks! 
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:50:01
Never heard it said like that.  Makes more sense now. Now to own and protect protect my own keys....
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:20:38
I literally hate how marketing trumps intelligent decisions...but it’s what I’ve see for a good long time. And this might be similar 
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:06:35
Right. We’ve just barely seen what segwit can do...it’s at what, like 10% implementation? This smacks of arrogance and greed 
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:25:25
I think you’re going to increase your bottom line by holding both.  Which ever chain reigns supreme is tbd, but if you have both, then it shouldn’t really matter in the long run.  The political side of this debate is super contentious...so much nasty “only my opinion is correct” stuff in here, drives me nuts.  If anything, check out r/btc and get a sense for what both camps are saying, helps to know both sides...hope that’s not wildly offensive to anyone 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:42:02
This is what I was wondering...so coinbase —
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:42:36
Precisely. (And sorry for all the misspellings in that last post..at bar on my phone).  But yes. That’s what I do. Keep a small fraction in the wallet, rest in the vault or on my Trezor.  It’s the thing most people have been looking for
IMO... 
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:54:45
Good 
@_date: 2017-09-22 04:19:00
Man I totally agree with this assessment. And it makes me wonder if eventually, with enough fracturing, the value will fracture as well. What if bitcoin was the first and therefore most 'valuable' crypto by default... perhaps the forking is really a sort of around the back 'inflation' situation.  Ug. Hope not. But this worries me 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:43:40
Before we get to contentious internetting, I will say: I hate how flippant and quick to judge people are in this sub. That said. Maybe I don’t. Which I’m fully able to acknowledge and recognize. I’m just simply asking a question....hoping for a more knowledgeable response 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:18:27
Fair enough 
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:30:20
No this was an app I downloaded years ago...not even sure of the name at this point. Just saw the pic on my comp randomly and laughed...
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:22:00
Good article. But it still leaves me wondering what do as coinbase holder who’s bummed to have missed out on the last fork (and corresponding free money).  I have a Trezor on order and electrum on my comp as well.  Still, there doesn’t appear to be a clear ‘best answer’ moving forward.  If nothing else, it seems like transferring my coins off coinbase and into electrum might allow me to capitalize off the oct 25th split... but the S2X is tricky still. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:38:51
That...I do not know.  And it scares me to think of the potential headaches. 
It’s a stop gap measure for sure.  But until short confirmation times (or the lightening network) becomes a thing, this is an interesting in between.  But you’re asking a very valid question...
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:00:58
If you have a coinbase account, you can get one for free.  Highly recommend 
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:56:13
Man, I just did almost the exact same thing...and am now in a similarly annoying situation.  The GDAX limit totally threw me off...only difference is I’m using a Trezor.  Not fun 
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:01:29
Yep! And that’s why I’m like, dafuq are these exchanges doing saying they might list S2X at all? It seems annoyingly obvious what this really is...
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:58:12
Nothing. Get a coinbase account and a shift card. It’s amazing...zero transaction fees and backed by visa 
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:04:24
Haha shit, you’re correct, oversold that a touch 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:53:06
Google shift card 
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:53:26
Precisely.  And with Segwit implementation at what, like 10%? We haven’t even seen what the first big change will allow for...yet these dudes are being super douchey and punching forward with something that the collective community is at best, apprehensive about.  Makes no sense to me.  
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:07:39
Wait.  Why wouldn’t you want it on coinbase? They’re going to split the coins for you ‘with in 4 hours’ after the split, according to their blog anyway.  And allegedly have figured out how to enforce replay protection...am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:44:37
Totally agree. That my plan. Except be aware of the transfer fees coming out of GDAX beforehand...
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:22:33
Same boat. I sincerely hope someone has a legit answer....but I’m guessing they won’t. It’s all in limbo...IMO.   
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:23:24
Why? They are claiming to have the ability to split each chain within 4 hours...which is a quick split...plus u saying tardcoin....?  Why. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:19:33
This I’m ok with, actually...I just would just like a consensus 
@_date: 2018-02-28 11:41:29
Is this largely due to coinbase jumping in? Or bc of the new code release? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:14:21
Right. I agree. But I mean more long term/overall...all I want the assurance the massive mining rigs won’t just jump network on the regular to whatever is momentarily more profitable 
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:50:57
I don’t get the analogy 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:05:03
So it’s a coinbase based partnership....they decided to make a crypto debit/credit card. And it’s brilliantly useful. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:49:30
That’s legit too. Crazy to think we’re still on the launching pad...but u might be right 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:29:11
Ahh damn...well then there’s no reason to move it immediately, beyond trusting coinbase... thank you for the info 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:07:48
I appreciate this question because I’m in a similar situation. Ideally, I’d like to not have to convert it back to fiat...which is to say, not pay capital gain taxes.  But I don’t feel like there’s enough businesses accepting btc to make that a reality...or at least at the moment. But I am hopeful that someday, we won’t have to deal with ‘real’ money and only pay for things in an entirely crypto landscape.  So for the moment, hold. Wait for more complete adoption. Figure it out once this wave passes 
@_date: 2018-07-07 22:46:24
So in a real sense, how many people are actually reacting to these advertisements?  Like, what’s the actual roi? Kinda baffled. 
I’d assume next to no-one.  Anyone think differently? I could be wrong. 
Basically,  can  someone please explain why anyone would invest based off this...odd advertisement? Thanks 
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:32:52
1. How much different would it really be? I think the chain is at like 180gigs now? How much crazier would that become with 2mb? Or more accurately, how much quicker would it become ‘unmanageable’?
2. Totally. This is necessity on whatever chain.  Except as I see it, it needs to happen with cores involvement....bc they seem to take a slower, but stable approach? Everyone needs this code...not sure who should do it. 
3. Sure, seems reasonable 
4. I’ve read enough to know that changing the block size “isn’t that complex”.... but I have no idea really. I’m
Sure it would need extensive testing. 
5. And they will. But it makes us believers all look stupid bc there’s now 8 different versions of bitcoin, none of which people know anything about, and all of which (except one) are diluting the quality of the name...it’s gonna be a negative feedback loop if this happens a ton more...and a new coin will emerge.  
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:13:52
Shift card via coinbase = free transactions and it’s backed by visa. I can buy a thing I want in the US with coin...and I’m guessing soon that’ll be international. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:11:50
So if you’re with coinbase, Shift just came out with a new ‘debit card’ (with a visa logo on it) that debits your account  for any and all typical purchases...it’s an interesting hybrid between holding and spending.  And it’s transaction fee free (or at least for the moment).  Seems like a perfect stepping stone which will allow you to hold and yet, reap the benefits of the crazy BTC appreciation 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:23:17
That’s not true. BCC would have no issues. Just that no one knows about it....hence my predicament 
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:21:32
That’s the one 
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:16:26
 I just asked the same same thing a few days ago...and have since moved all my coin off GDAX to my Trezor.  My take is that if you own your own private keys, you will be able extract the extra coins using some sort of process that is well vetted by the trezor community.  Alternatively, you could leave them on GDAX and they will immediately split them for you and hand you the SX2 coins about 4 hours after the fork.  That also seems appealing, but, I’m wary of transferring any coins so soon after the split bc of the lack of replay protection... TLDR: use a trezor or ledger and wait until a few weeks after the split to better asses what to do 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:53:53
Coinbase + shift card = perfect hybrid that exists right now. No processing fees either 
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:54:41
My thoughts exactly. Except. Why is it that when you have coins off coinbase, you’re able to split.  In other words, why do these electronic wallets support more fork functionality than coinbase? That perplexed me 
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:34:19
And you wagered....
