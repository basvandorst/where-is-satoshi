We kind of suspected that, when coins started moving around in the blockchain.
However multiple of the plaintiffs's lawyers have been handing over information over to the courts as thing were discovered, so Jap police had to take action at some point. Good to know that it's finally happening.
Mark has a history of claiming to creditors that he's under police restraint as an excuse to fault on his obligations, so it's no mystery that he has tried this trick again.

Good point Lawsky, regulation is a double edged sword. Long time ago the choice between bank acceptance or freedom of a peer controlled currency was quite obvious.
First we dealt with law enforcement thinking of Bitcoin as a tool only interesting for criminals, now the bigger criminals moves in for our own greater good.
"no more bailouts" was not a mindless time stamp.   This kind of regulation, while protecting the unepxperienced small trader, will make Bitcoin only a tool for the elite using exchanges that has the blessing of Wal Street.

The only situation where fungibility would not be harmed was if Karpeles just had lost the keys and no possible theft was involved. Then the community could restore his control of his coins as a result of a majority consensus on updating the mining clients to ones with the "lost" bitcoins in a, by MtGox, controllable wallet. Then again the coins should not have been moved around as they have been now, as ownwership is now impossible to prove.

Strictly, none. You can do everything at an ATM easier at home. But they are great attention getters.
If you are going to fiddle with your phone and have to wait until your identrity have been verified, it's easier to do at home.
Bitcoin ATM's were invisioned before KYC was considered so they are a great deal more cumbersome to use than was original envisioned.

Every asset in what's left of Gox and Mark personal fortune, if he is found guilty of a crime. Will be valued. Then Claimants, you and me, will have their claims valued. Fiat as EUR are easy to value, Bitcoins will be given a fixed exchange price (value) to make them comparable to fiat claims.

I think the OP is wary about the early mined coins that have been dormant for years. But that is true with gold also. If not that many gold holders wanted to sell today, prices would colapse, because that there is not much movement (utility) in that market either.

It's easier than that. Government issues a fixed amount Votecoin and have evrery citizen download wallet software with one coin in it.
The wallet address generated will be random, and the citizen votes by paying with the coin to the candidates public wallet address. Total anonymity for everybody. and impossible to cheat if there is used some other form of online identification when the wallet is downloaded.
We have government issued paper keycards ( a kind of manual 2FA) in my country Denmark, to legally prove identity.

That's a perfectly good question, clearly poster has a sensible question to traders mentality.
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:08:52
It's easy to understand: Both traders escrow a percentage of the order payed in BTC to an address. Then they start transferring USD &lt;-&gt; BTC in chunks the size of their escrowed warrenty sum, After the exchange has taken place, they both release the escrow funds to be paid back to them. If one pary cheats with the last chunk, he loses his chunk in escrow so the incentive to cheat is gone.
It's a nice idea, but it sound slow then further slowed down by P2P. but a non human exchange is an attractive concept.

The comparison to glass beads is not completely wrong. They are stating that bitcoin has no utility value (other than as a payment vehicle).

The way to get money out of these countries, besides with bitcoins, is to have middlemen (family members in other countries) then your uncle in America gets paid by the buyers sister in Germaney.

Then you uncle in america can send you the bitcoins.

The proportion between cold and hot wallets has nothing to do with how many accounts are active or how much trade the exchange sees. The ratio is determined by the size of buffer you need to handle deposits and withdraws. It's only when there is a period where deposits and withdraws do not balance that the cold wallet is touched.

That depends: if the market is scared because of Gox starting paying out, they should be scared now too, because some hacker might start a sellout any second.
Money will move to other exchanges, and that can go both ways. We are talking about 1.5-2% of coins in circulation being payed back to account holders, so even if half of them goes to exchanges, not much impact.

I thought about that too, but that will make bitcoin centralised. A body with such power could be bought out or pressured by governments.

Money in the bank doesn't create underspending as interest is too low to make it worth while.
In the 80'ies interest was higer than inflation so everybody saved. Gold was 288$ as money in the bank was a better investment.
I had fellow students that took cheap state warranted loans and put the money in the bank and made 2% on their loan. Yeou paid 6% on your loan and got 8% in the bank. Simply crazy.

Danish authorities havn't clearly stated that exchanging bitcoin as a mony business is okay here. Quite the opposite has been signalled  from banks and financial institutons and that has been a buzz kill here for OTC and Danish exchange sites, which is a prerequesite for getting local businesses in Denmark to join in larger numbers.

China is a magic country.
Most of the high-profit markets are monopolized by the government via state-owned firms, banking is a typical example.  Alibaba and Tencent have challenged this monopoly, "forcing" the government to carry out this banning regulation to protect the banks.

Bitcoin is not sovereign, if too few hoardes keeps too much in the mattresses, people will choose other payment methods.
It's different from a national currency, where the masses are forced to use a decreeded currency thuss keeping the value of the 1%'ers fortunes.

The one most important reason for Denmark's stalled economy is unemployment insurrance and welfare for unemployed. (BTW I'm out of a job as of today, and I would never, as a Dane, claim welfare!).
Unions have made firing people very expensive so with such a high level of job security, there is no incentive to innovate. Nobody start a small business in Denmark. Income distribution is too narrow because of that. I don't hope I come acreoss as cynical rightist, actually social consiousness is quite high on my list of ideals.

We are in the phase of mainstream and regulation is a part of that. Businesses will close because of compliance issues, but others will prewail.
Precedence will be established and a viable model for different kind of businesses wil devellop, so bitcoin is not facing an unmountable barrier right now, it's just phasing into something more practical.
The uncertainty is suppressing prices right now, but that's not the short term perspective to consider Bitcoin from.
