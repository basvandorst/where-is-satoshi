Sincerely - Who cares what he thinks? It's like asking Pepsi Co what they think of Soda Stream.

Well, lost in the limbo forever, since Genesis block address is unspendable

I believe the unit that is worth 10,000 satoshis is the best unit to convert now - at the middle of the current units system.
Name BITS is the best name for the unit, regardless if correct.
1 BIT = 10,000 satoshis
1 Bitcoin = 100,000,000 satoshis
1 Bitcoin = 10,000 Bits

Like every crooked banker, he will just pay the lawyers and whatever comes against him and still will have profit. This until no users ever come back to his crooked operation. If I had something on coinbase now, I would be looking to withdraw ASAP.

Multiple accounts solve this issue if someone don't want addresses linked...

This is crazy. People just don't revolt over this because they are too busy with entertainment and drugs...

Drugs are also great to numb you from the present state. Not saying it is the same for everyone, I feel ya. When I talk about drugs, I'm talking mostly about alcohol and sugar (corn syrup) - not eye opening drugs that help people reflect and expand their minds.

"Today i will add TXT DNS record in LNBIG.com as proof that this email is of project" - where is this?

I think I have had around 90% success rate at the current state of the LN routing payments having only 1 channel open. This is pretty good IMO. Managed to use it as intended and looks like as long as there are more users interconnected, more paths will be available to increase success rate to almost 100%. Worst case scenario you need to fund a new channel (another on-chain tx)

I would only argue that if this entity decides to pull the plug to all these nodes at once (close channels), it might cause some disruption. Hope more BTC is injected into the network from different players so we have more decentralized liquidity sources

I see several ways of hacking this device (well, actually, the user of  the device). Device itself can be a rock, the user is soft.

More and more nodes connecting every day to test the LN... Nodes that are running on Tor are listed there or only node that request to be listed?
