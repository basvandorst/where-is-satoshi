My shortened understanding of what I want to do is:
1. Get a bitcoin wallet
2. go to a BTM
3. with my CC, purchase bitcoins 
4. use bitcoins to buy stuff
I dunno, seems pretty simple to me.

"Especially if you first have to acquire bitcoin" &lt;-- confusing.
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:28:04
I do.
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:28:49
hmm.. well I couldn't figure it out in the 10ish minutes I was on the site, so I'm getting the feeling it's not quite as simple as I'd like.
@_date: 2015-08-10 09:41:42
I get it. Not a terrible idea.

iPhone user, but thanks.

Completely useless to me. First of all, I don't currently have any bitcoins. And second, I have zero intention of using bitcoins with any regularity; the website I want to subscribe to is only accepting bitcoins atm, so acquiring some is my only option.
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:21:47
As a matter of fact there is.
@_date: 2015-08-11 03:49:07
Cool. Thank you!

How exactly do they work? I mean, I get the basic premise, but exactly what do you *get*? When you go to a regular ATM, you put your card in, and you "get" cash. Now I know bitcoins don't physically exist, so how do I receive my bitcoins? Compared to a regular ATM experience, for instance.

Are you saying the app allows one to purchase BTC from one's iPhone using one's PayPal account?
@_date: 2015-08-10 11:50:37
I guess my confusion stemmed from the fact that you appear to imply that there is a circumstance where you wouldn't need to "acquire bitcoin ... before you can do a transaction with bitcoin". I think I understand what you were meaning to say, though.
@_date: 2015-08-11 03:51:19
hmm.. that sounds ideal. Thanks for the tip.

Ok, so then that means I'm going to have to install a bitcoin wallet app on my phone, correct? Recommendations? Seeing as how I already signed up at circle.com, I suppose their wallet app would make sense for me.

I signed up (with Circle.com), linked my CC, and my Canadian-ness didn't appear to be a problem. There is a 3-5 business day verification process, though, so I'll have to wait to find out for sure.
