Is it needed to have a process to prove that the BTC address is owned by me and I made the transaction? The same is to prove that the received BTC address is owned by the seller.

Unless we can settle the digital ownership someday, it is needed to be managed by the government, laws and the legal documents arranged by lawyers as you said. The point to discuss is, how to be protected when using BTC to buy real world things and minimize the risk of transactions

IOTA and NANO are cool, they use other approaches

That's the real problem of users. I know BTC was born to against Governments, but it is not the point here to discuss

Blockchain is the internet in 1980s, not Bitcoin!

I still believe in [McAfee]( haha

Smart contract as on Ethereum network? Even like that, you can not be protected when the partner on your transaction cheats. I want to discuss to get a solution. As wobzilla65 stated, now it required additional legal papers to be set up.

I always support BTC and I am a BTC Hodler. "FUD" or "FOMO" are the fucking stupid words they've ever invented. Lol

Can you give more info, bro
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:40:03
It's gonna be top 1 soon!

You have the best answer til now. I want to discuss about the solution to solve the current weakness of BTC. Not criticizing it here!
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:58:49
I support BTC. On Internet we get a lot of advantages from BTC but in real transactions where trust can not be removed it is still not better than fiat now.

I think hundreds million people see the name Verge everyday is good enough for it. Even better for all crypto as well
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:03:08
Lighting still works, even better
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:11:53
That's funny, lol
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:04:33
That’s why Ethereum with Smart Contract concept got in to the competition buddy. Debate with me using logic please if you can

I see it is not as easy as miners would join together to form 51% hash power. The capital to buy mining machine is the same with buying BTC to stake. The difficulty to do both things are similar.

That's good news for BTC
