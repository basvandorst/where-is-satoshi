Guy who bankrupts four casinos - literally an impossible business model to fuck up - hates bitcoin?  Best endorsement in its history.

Yes.  It's hotel management with an added revenue stream that is scalable as a function of parameters you can tune--i.e. you control the games played, the rates of return on those games, and the rate at which you comp ordinary hotel services to players.  Getting this wrong is a massive business failure.  If you can generate the capital to open a casino, keeping it going with an ROI that's better than other vehicles is a no-brainer.

Transferring money is really easy? Internationally?  Instantly?  Securely?  Might you be confusing user experience with the complexity and cost associated with the infrastructure that makes it easy for you the user to feel confident making that transfer?  
  
I'm just predicting that at some point, it will be cheaper even for large financial entities who do daily or nightly net settlements of all the transactions processed that day to add something like BTC to their toolkits, assuming it isn't still deflating 20% every night.

Didn't Dwolla already figure out that a flat $0.25/transaction is a useful model?

The donation would offset taxable income, not tax due.  Charity is never a 1-for-1 alternative to tax, or nobody would *ever* actually pay taxes instead of sending that same $ amount to charities of their choosing.

Who cares.  I posted this because it provokes calculation.    
  
There's some mental math to be done.  Even the hugest estimate, 2.5x10^6 tonnes = 2.5x10^12 grams, at $50/g ~ $1.25x10^14 value, but obviously less than 100% of that is in a monetizable form and astoundingly little of it is anywhere near as liquid as BTC.   
  
The maximum number of bitcoin units when all mining has completed is 2.1x10^15 (satoshi).  Even if you mapped all of that to half the value of gold (arbitrarily calling them equivalent forms), one satoshi would be worth roughly (6x10^13 )/(2x10^15 ) = $0.03.   
  
This is obviously neglecting any further appreciation, recognition of the added utility that BTC brings structurally, etc.--meaning, it's a very conservative estimate.   
  
If one satoshi = $0.03 US; hell if it's $0.01, then 1BTC = $100K.  Obviously this is order-of-magnitude, not-even-back-of-the-envelope-entirely-in-my-head analysis only, but I think there are more ways for this to be off by a log or two in the good direction than the bad.

Their comments will reveal a complete lack of understanding of the concept of currency in general, especially fiat vs. btc, interspersed with pseudo-political talking points.  We have creationists on congressional science committees; expect people who can't even balance a checkbook to be saying stupid crap about Bitcoin.

The magnitude of the valuation bubble has, as a first-order component, something related to the fraction of people who don't get this joke.

same.  we can all do the math in our heads if we're here...it's bringing it to the masses.  It's like cars rated by miles-per-gallon in the US vs. L/100km in the UK.  Or not...I just think it'll be a cool shift when we see the blog title "Bitcoin now so popular that it's trading in millis"

Everybody finished their black Friday shopping and needs some cash.  As a true believer, I just padded my BTC position with a wash sale (like I do every time there's a big dump).

As far as confusing symbols go...for 750 Bhat you can get an hour-long foot massage.  For 750 BTC, you could the whole massage parlor.

Basically.  I see the growth rate of the calculations necessary to maintain the blockchain integrity as a problem unless the growth in transactions/users is 1:1 with the growth in mining activity, which it won't be as more casual users jump in.  
  
More fundamentally, the idea that you commit resources to mining and MIGHT get a payoff if you're lucky is great for the early adopters right now, but isn't likely to be sustainable to run a mature network unless the payoffs are either freakishly high (meaning high fees) or the system of reward distribution evolves toward doing something more equitable, or at least commensurate with invested flops &amp; bandwidth.

Regarding 4 - [FedEx and UPS will use USPS]( for the last leg of delivery chains.  It is almost guaranteed that Western Union *et al.* will realize that BTC (or some other virtual currency) represents the same operational cost-savings and incorporate it into their protocols.  The relationships are analogous.  This will be...immense.

i'd x-post this to but a) it's probably already there and b) i bet there's a lot of mathrock fans who are in to the bitcoin.
