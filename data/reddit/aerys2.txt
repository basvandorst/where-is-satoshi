Ticket ID  But please, don't give me that and don't lie to people, I tried to deal with you for months and gave you all the necessary possible proof(I shouldnt even have to, you're even asking for proof of stuff that is not on my balance anymore, again showing you are looking for any excuse to keep my money) you asked of the "funds origins" and you kept asking for more and more so you'll only pretend that you're waiting for more infos while I gave you already everything I can possibly give even if I shouldnt have to , you are the only crypto exchange to ask for that and to dare block withdrawals (typical scam behavior), no exchange ever did that(except scams indeed ), blocking funds because you dont pass their extremely intrusive KYC, but it's never enough for you, a good excuse to lock my funds for the eternity and bet on them.

The thing is, that has nothing to do with and does not justify locking my funds at all ( especially since 99% of my funds have nothing to do with BAR/TBAR that I already don't have anymore so it's not even an excuse and could never be " you were unlucky to be among the ones receive tokens from Titanium for helping them so it will be our excuse as an exchange to keep your money forever including the majority of it that has nothing to do with Titanium,  now locked and kept by HitBTC, thank you :) ", not a scam at all indeed) , you already made me lose a ton of money by locking my funds for so long and should refund me for the ton of money lost meanwhile since you locked my account during BTC crash preventing me to do  anything for 6 months !
And anyway, nothing justifies stealing people money just because you decided on your own that you have the right to keep people money forever if you want, so don't give me the " to protect you " bullshit when the only thing you do for us is ruining us by locking people money ,  no decent exchange ever did or would do what you did, a honest and a decent exchange would at worse delete your account leaving you 30 days to remove your funds but would never arbitrary decide that your funds are their property now and forever using illegitimate excuses to not send it back to you.
The only thing you show to people here, if you insist in stealing my funds, is that our money is not safe at all on your exchange.
So I'm waiting for the unlock of my account now in the day since I played your stupid game more than long enough and gave you all possible infos anyone could give in this situation , there is no excuse that gives you the right to keep people funds anyway.
"They're locking accounts and making unreasonable demands for private information, which many people \*can't\* provide even if they wanted to. And when you don't/can't comply, they just keep your bitcoins instead of closing your account and sending them to you." This sums up perfectly what you are doing
**These funds are not your property, it's mine, it's money that I own and sent on  the platform HitBTC, that is the only thing you need to know, if I want to get it back, you have no word to say about it, period.**

Yeah, I'm shocked by this fact too, that no regulator dealt with them and people are still getting scammed, worse, big projects are still putting their token on their exchange, incentivizing their investors too go trade there while all projects should ban this exchange, they have their responsibility in this matter

You're again sending me the very same message like a robot since 6 months asking me for crazy stuff( " notarized letter " seriously, who are you trying to fool with that ? Nobody has or gives that in the crypto industry, especially for things like bounty or services paid in tokens ) that does not exist anymore on the account, it's irrelevant and just an excuse to lock the funds left on my account !
So I do one last attempt to resolve this issue peacefully with you, I sent you any possible document and info anyone could have to justify this kind of funds, if you still choose to lock my money after making me lose my time to give you any possible documents, it says a lot about HitBTC and anyone will be able to see it and know about it.

Thanks for the tip, I let them one last chance to resolve this peacefully, if they insist in locking my funds forever after I gave them any possible document ( even if I should not have to justify the origins of my funds to get them back), I will do that and any other possible thing to let anyone know.

I gave the right number to your teammate Rachel ahead, I just checked my mails history, I did send you my photo, passeport, bank account(so what is it if it's not a KYC?) and "funds origins " infos and this was the ticket ID
And then I sent you another request message  to remind you to unlock my account and you asked me for the VERY SAME THING I had already sent you putting this on another ticket 379986.
So I contact you again now with the same email forwarding you all our past mails you seem to have lost and do not delay this situation anymore !

I'll probably get a lawyer just to make it official but since most lawyers don't know anything about blockchain and crypto exchanges and law applied to it, maybe it would be useful to show to my lawyer the work already done by another lawyer. ( plus to know where the lawyer should send that because he will probably ask me)

google " real volume crypto exchanges"

Would she still have an example of the letter sent and the address to who she sent it to ?  
It'd be helpful to know the process to get back my money from these scammers
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:55:03
Yeah that's what I'm thinking, when I was trading there with little amounts, I had no issue but as soon as I sent a big amount of my token to sell it in november, they froze my account , making me regret that I ever deposited anything in this scammer exchanges.
Now they are like " cooperate with us and don't look for outside help" , implying " don't spread the word about your funds stolen by us if you ever want to see them again one day " lol.

Hi Rachel, the correct ticket ID is 
But please don't tell me you are waiting infos from me when I already sent you all justifications possible I had on my hand and your team just disregarded them so now I don't care, I just want my funds back, unlock my account and let me withdraw, I can't send you what I don't have and what I should not have to anyway to get my funds unlocked when you ask me to justify about funds that are not even on my account anymore since a year, that's like a silly excuse to block funds I already justified, it's been 6 months, it's time to be honest and act like a decent exchange for once and to unlock my account
@_date: 2019-04-08 03:32:01
I will, so far, no updates on their side and if they ever contact me, it will be to ask the same thing I already gave them pretending I did not

Such Silly move from them, that will allow crypto to take even more market share
