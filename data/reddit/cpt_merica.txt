Begging the question: What would a superior altcoin look like given what we already know about bitcoin?

I think means Moolah.io (Prelude.io) is Moolah's exchange. I have a merchant store in Moolah's platform and they do instant conversion to fiat and a weekly settlement to your bank account. This feature is available through merchants that use their storefront platform of their API. It is by request to their support staff.

Copied and pasted my response from here:
Thanks for making me get out of bed. :(
Sure, I'd like to get to know the CEO better, too, but let's separate the facts from speculation.


Can you provide a link that this is absolutely true? In the states we have a thing called registered agents to offload the paperwork and legal summons to a third party. This also protects companies from being harassed. There are reasons to use entities as a means to limit some exposure. Smaller companies use it a lot. Until you have a huge legal team, it is better off that you use a registered agent.


You make the claim, but could you site a source please? I'm not saying you're wrong, since trading sites require signing up to trade shares of a stock, but we're talking about a private company. As far as I know, private companies do not require individuals to sign with any federal authority to be a part owner. Like, my uncle can start a business, and I could own a portion of it. I'm not obligated to anyone except paying the taxes based on my ownership. A simple form 1065 would suffice if it was an LLC. For s-corps, there is a form 1065 and some other forms. For c-corps, I'm not certain, but please show me how Moolah is registered in the states, and what laws they are specifically breaking.


Your point? I'm sure Coinbase, Cryptsy, and Mintpal has a TON. This is how these businesses operates. Nothing is wrong here.


Okay. Is this telling of a threat, or are you just being insulting? I'm not sure what your point is. Business is business. Sometimes that's a lot, sometimes that's not. But storefronts is one aspect of the business.


Or... you know, the investment of founders. You're assuming that you have all the facts. As an audience reading your OP, it is easy to assume YOU are right, but the fact is that you don't have the answer. Have to seen a balance sheet? Have you read through the articles of incorporation? Are there SEC filings or equivalents that you know of to be able to address where from the balance sheet these expenses are being incurred?


Mt. Gox had a public figure, one that was supportive of the Bitcoin community, and STILL it got... Gox'd. So, Alex Green being a non-public figure is not an argument. This is an incongruent comparison.


I'd like to know. But that's just for my curiosity. But in your thorough investigation, you failed to realize that Alex Green will be speaking at a conference in Singapore in June or July. My memory fails me. It was in a tweet.


That would be nice. Does every other merchant platform and exchange also do this? If so, this is a great thing to do. If not, are you just putting a spotlight on Moolah and not the others? My point is that Moolah is being unfairly targeted if the latter is true. Which is a witchhunt based on circumstance.


They've actually explained the IRC tip a while back, many times. As for the others, why should they be explained to you? Are you the SEC? I'd like to know, but I also know that financials aren't necessary to publish to the public for private companies.


I address this above, but I'm not 100% sure either. Do you know something that I don't that makes you absolutely sure that the type of incorporation of Moolah in the US isn't compliant?


Who is we?

While GMG mulls over the idea of accepting digital currency as a payment method, my partner and I launched  today to accept digital currency as payment for games. We've partnered with to sell his game during our Limited Beta to stress test the platform. Right now we're limited to Dogecoin, but Bitcoin is coming in future tests. One thing to note is that we're pushing for devs to accept digital currency as payment. We believe cryptocurrencies are inevitable, we hope to be part of helping build this new economy.
Feel free to ask me any questions regarding the platform/service.

Very interesting article. The author does see it from a finance/economist standpoint, and I'm going to try to see it from an accounting standpoint. I'm an accountant at a non-profit, not yet a CPA, so take what I have to say with a debit of salt.
The most basic accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. This is your balance sheet equation.
Assets = What you have
Liabilities = What you owe
Owner's Equity = Your interest in the assets
To simplify, Assets are cash and receivables (what people owe you). As the article states, a bank can lend out 90% of its cash, but the bank would show no decrease in assets. In fact, the bank would show an increase in assets since the amount to receive would include the interest from the cash that they've loaned.
So, if a bank loaned $90, their cash would decrease by $90 and their receivables would increase by $90 + interest. And, to complete the equation, their equity would also increase by that interest receivable amount.
The article states that banks can loan double, triple, quadruple, ad nauseum, borrowed from the federal reserve. The reason banks can do this is because each individual account is insured by FDIC (correct me if I’m wrong). So, if that original $100 is loaned out 5 different times, each time reduced by 10%, that means the sum of all those loans can be withdrawn at all institutions even if none of those banks had the cash to honor the withdrawal. Where does this money come from? My guess is the federal reserve would have to print/distribute more money.
Now, this wouldn’t work for bitcoin because (1) there is no central bank insuring bitcoins, and (2) bitcoins cannot be created after the last one is mined. This brings me to the whole interest receivable amount. Interest receivables are likely to be occur when more cash is being circulated; especially in the context of a loan being re-loaned many times. In bitcoin, no more cash would be circulated, therefore any interest earned would mean a decrease in the amount of circulation outside of the bank. How this affects the entire system, I have no idea—this is just what would happen. 
My whole point is that the basic accounting equation could apply to bitcoin, and bitcoins could be loaned by banks. However, when bitcoin banks earn interest, that means the total amount of bitcoins (in global circulation after the last one has been mined) does not change, while in fiat, the amount could increase. What does this mean? Banks can't create risky loans with bitcoin because they're not insured by governments (and taxpayers).
edit: added to tl;dr about the condition of last bitcoin mined

Thanks for the feedback! I'll put the background as something I need to adjust. Since this Limited Beta is featuring just one dev, the page was dedicated to them. We'll launch with our own branding when we fully launch.

I'm one of two cofounders of Coinplay.io. We've been working for the past couple months building a platform for digital content delivery with digital currency in mind. We've also partnered with an independent game developer to sell authorized Steam activation keys for them. Currently we're accepting Dogecoin only, but we're implementing Bitcoin in our second Limited Beta (TBD). Today we're just securing and delivering keys, but the platform itself is built to do much more.
Feel free to ask me any questions about the service/platform.

Because you have all the answers... does Tether fit into this scenario?
@_date: 2014-11-18 00:39:03
A majority of the developers that are getting back to us already have a mild to high interest in BTC, which is encouraging. We've got several contracts pending, and I'm dying to push the games to the store front and start accepting digital currencies for them. Even better is when a developer wants to accept BTC as their final payout. Gratifying on both ends! (I don't see how that can be taken out of context)

I started [Coinplay.io over year ago]( with the intention of accepting Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin for Steam games. 
We're strictly an authorized game reseller that works with game developers and publishers. We even give our partners the option to receive Bitcoin for their earnings.
We've been featured on [VentureBeat]( [CoinDesk]( [Silicon Prairie News]( [CryptoCoinsNews]( and a couple other publications.
In May, we started selling Steam game bundles. We have a few bundles [active now](
**tl;dr:** [Coinplay.io]( is an authorized Steam game reseller that sells games and game bundles. We accept BTC, LTC, DOGE, and traditional payment methods. We even offer game devs and publishers Bitcoin as a payment for their earnings.

Okay, this will probably be a newbie question... but why go through the trouble of a local exchange. Why not just sell with Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-12-29 18:34:18
I've wondered the same as the author, but I see no reason (at this time) to be so pessimistic. The thing about the author's question is that it is conditional to an absolute. Bitcoin will die if all interest in bitcoin dies. The same devaluing of fiat can occur if that currency lost all support. Is it possible that bitcoin can lose all value? Sure. Is it going to happen? No one has that type of data today to make such a prediction. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:34:38
Looking at some historical charts, there are decreases in difficulty, but those were a long time ago, and few and far between. I need to figure out how to determine difficulty by total hashrates. Then more accurate models projections can be made based on X number of ASIC miners shipping by Y date. Another big consideration are those hosted GH/s services. The only way to squeeze out profit is if exchange rates increased in parallel to difficulty, and that figure is even more difficult to predict, I would think.

There's also several stories of family members gifting their entire clan bitcoins for Christmas. Not that there's anyway to verify how many new bitcoin unaware people were just thrown into the fray, but if the number is at all material, it could account for increased activity and price.

Is there a list of notable billionaires that have invested in bitcoin? The Winklevoss twins did that AMA roughly a month ago citing investment in Trusts. Richard Branson's name was mentioned. Like you say, someone like Warren Buffet would be a huge benefit to bitcoin. I'm wondering if there's anyone else with credibility that could bring growth and stability to the currency.
