For a company which bills itself as environmentally friendly, Whole Foods selling GMO products makes them quite unfriendly to the environment.
GMO crops usually require pesticide use and pesticides are harmful to the environment. Furthermore, genes from GMO crops are making their way into organic, heirloom crops and as this process continues the GMO crop will prevail and essentially exterminate the organic, heirloom varieties from existence. GMO crops thus spell the end of our food supply as we've known it thus far on planet Earth.
For this reason, and many others, I will never give a dime (or a satoshi) to Whole Foods. They talk one way and act another. They pull you in with their "green" marketing and public image, then continue to sell you the same harmful products you can get at Wal-Mart for much less. But at least they pay their employees a decent wage...
And before you say that Whole Foods is just filling a demand, remember that their customers go to Whole Foods because they are demanding an alternative to GMO products and conventional processed foods.
Edit: If you want real, local food check out your local food cooperative or health foods store. Let's not support corporate giants, eh?

According to my wallet, these transactions have 600+ confirmations.

Interesting. Thanks.

With regards to the Whole Foods deli, nothing is labeled as organic in the deli and that's because none of the ingredients are. So they are not mislabeling, they are just overcharging for the same produce going to every other grocery store and getting away with it because of their "green" public image which probably leads many customers to assume the deli ingredients are organic.
Most grocery stores are indeed supporting Monsanto on some level unless they stock primarily organic products. Many food cooperatives make an effort to do this.
It sounds like you are doing your best and that's what matters I suppose. I sometimes forget that a lot of folks only have Whole Foods as an option to get organic food at all. Living in Organic Valley has got me spoiled. :-/

Do you have a local food cooperative or health foods store?
How many $$$ did Whole Foods donate to the GMO labeling campaign in California in 2012? 0.
They are in bed with Monsanto. The vast majority of the products on their shelves contain GMO ingredients. All that food in the deli? Yeah, none of it is organic. When you shop at Whole Foods, yes you are supporting a business that treats its employees quite well, but you are also supporting a business that upholds the status quo in groceries.
If you have a local food cooperative or locally-owned health foods store, you may want to check them out.

I do believe there are fees of .2% for using the local trader service.

It doesn't happen to me.
I just had a BTC withdrawal process almost instantaneously at Mintpal.

That's why I'm asking what you all think. I can't think of any way I could be exploited by these micro payments, but I surely don't know everything.
I suppose maybe it's just spam advertising for some website I won't be visiting.

There were two micro payments like this made to my HD wallet with these same vanity address inputs. The transactions contained a couple dozen outputs of .000006 each, presumably to random addresses.
What do you guys think? Ever had this happen to you?

I know is on vacation right now so that may have something to do with the slow response.
Do you have screenshots of the sell order and how it was filled?
@_date: 2014-12-30 00:55:53
Well I'm glad you tried it, because I'm not going to...
@_date: 2014-12-29 01:48:40
Yeah, I guess I'm just wondering if there is anything I should do to protect myself. 
If it's malware, what would be the method of delivery? There aren't any links to click on, only transaction IDs and input/output addresses. Are they expecting me to go to my browser and type in block chain ping . com?
Obviously I won't be doing that....

I don't believe I said that non-GMO crops don't require pesticides. And I certainly was not confusing GM with monoculture. Perhaps I should not have said that GMO crops usually *require* pesticides, but that GMO crops are usually used in conjunction with pesticides. Yes, there are GMO crops with "built in" pest resistance in their GMO genome, but the majority of conventionally farmed crops are using pesticides. I live in the rural Midwest, I see the farmers spraying all the time.
Organic farming practices sometimes implement natural pesticides like neem oil, but we (I help out on an organic farm) never use chemical pesticides and that is the point I was trying to make. Organic practices are always better for the environment.
What I had meant to point out regarding GMO genes threatening our food supply is that Monsanto's GMO corn's patented gene ends up in its pollen which makes its way to organic corn crops, resulting in organic corn crops containing this GMO gene. This makes it difficult to grow purely organic corn and even more difficult to save organic seed when everyone else is growing Monsanto's corn. If we reach a point where it's impossible to save organic corn seed because every organic crop has been polluted with Monsanto's gene, then what? Then you have a situation like what I was talking about where the heirloom varieties are gone and all we have is Monsanto corn.
Humans having engineered plants and animals over centuries is far different than taking genes from one organism and splicing them into another organism. This is opening up a can of worms about which we know very, very little. And it's entirely unnecessary. Organic farming and permaculture practices work with the planet's natural cycles and are more than powerful enough to produce enough food for everyone.

Who cares? Bear whale cashed out and has had a full year to rebuy much cheaper. Bear whale won.
