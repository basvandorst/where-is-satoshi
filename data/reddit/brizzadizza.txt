If I wanted to write my own bot to look for short positions, which exchanges offer that information? I don't see anything in the GDAX api (for instance) that lets me see short positions, so wondering if anyone knows what to look into?

Wow, what a revolutionary. If and only if a deus ex machina is dropped in your lap the world will be plunged back into the stone ages. Until such time you'll respond to a random comment via a tech stack that lies completely outside of your understanding, predicated on deeply intertwined economic systems that you similarly have no understanding of, and opine sagely about the impending doom that will consume us all but which has no ability to move you from the couch. 3edgy5me buddy.

Meanwhile, the belief that the rich are only wealthy due to birth and circumstance, absolutely AOK. In any event the wealthy don't have to be entirely benevolent to have positive effects on the economy.

400 of the richest people isn't indicative of the entire class of wealthy people. In this case you are specifically looking at the very farthest right of overlapping bell curves. My premise that the majority of wealthy people are there because of savvy investment and sound businesses still holds even if 60% of the 400 wealthiest people on the planet come from generational wealth.
It doesn't take an 80k college tuition to have a chance today. The only reason you should even consider a degreeis if it's an explicit requirement of your trade. And only then if the investment in the degree pays off. There are thousands of occupations that require little more than 1 year of formal trade school that can provide for a household. With the internet and some acumen, an intelligent person has access to basically every professional certification and its required coursework to get into any number of technical trades. And opportunities like cryptocurrency have been coming around every decade. Birth circumstances have never played as small a role in the acquisition of wealth as they do today.

Who is "their" in your rhetoric, precisely? I can say I enjoyed providing IT services to mortgage lenders up to and slightly through 2008. I can also say that in my experience, the majority of people running the offices I was selling services to were decent caring people and that few of them came from money and still became wealthy during that period. Were they actually sociopaths in disguise? Was paying off my school/credit card debt, employing, housing, and feeding me some clever ruse to make me think they were magnanimous? And even if it was, since I was only relying on their ability to pay my invoice, should I care?

Then so are you. Why are you on the internet responding to this if its as dire as you pretend to believe?

If you really believed that you wouldn't be on reddit responding to this thread. Chicken-little-ism is one more luxury afforded to you by the economy you claim is killing the planet.

You keep claiming common sense as though the acquisition and maintenance of wealth has any great correlation to it. Most people are bad with money. They don't know what to do with it. That includes the children of wealthy people. The average term of generational wealth is like 2 generations. It means if your grandpa is wealthy, your dad is middle class, and you're not likely to receive much of anything worth respect to an inheritance.  It is the rare family that manages to grow inherited wealth.

Keep telling yourself that. Becoming a millionaire in the United states is attainable for anyone earning around 50k per year living a frugal lifestyle and prudently investing. "Inherented" wealth doesn't even enter the equation.

Why don't you need to know names? Who are you referring to? What specific individuals receive the benefits you're detailing? How did you even come upon the fact that "they" receive these benefits?

It is not a fact.

So then you don't have this information available and yet you know your claims to be true? How? You seem very certain that the world's economic ills can be laid at the feet of "them" yet you are unable to indicate who "them" is. I know and work with wealthy people. What information do you have that should cause me to believe you?
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:52:24
Yes. I think the majority of wealthy people are wealthy due to savvy investment and sound businesses. Sitting on wealth means it's eaten by inflation. Being a moron and wealthy makes you a mark for predators and conmen. Neither of these states are conducive to maintaining wealth in modern economies.

Remember in the Weimar republic when women would sell themselves, their daughters and their sons for a loaf of bread? Good times man. Glad to have 'em back.

The Forbes 400 list will only be able to tell us about the top 400 people in an 80trillion dollar per year global economy. That 40% of that pool did not have access to the generational wealth that you claim is the prerequisite for any wealth supports my position. That means that of the 400 richest people listed by Forbes, 160 of them started with significantly less than the incumbent generation and still ended at the top of the pile. This doesn't even address the millions of wealthy people that would never make it onto the Forbes list.

You are conflating several different references to "the majority" in this statement. The block size debate "majority" you referenced earlier is an abstract polling of interested parties in how bitcoin is currently implemented. The "majority" that the bitcoin network relies upon to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain is a different majority.


In light of your ambiguity above, I am interpreting the "5 people" detailed in your response as hold out developers. In which case, the decentralized solution is to simply fork the code and get the greater market share on your new alt-coin. Majority rules is not the same as decentralized software, nor is it germane to the improvement of open-source software.

If the position of a small blocker is "raising the block limit isn't the way to proceed" then "We'll only raise it 1/4th of what we said before" isn't really a compromise. 
Classic analogy: You and your neighbor have a land dispute. He claims your entire property is his. You disagree. He then says, "ok, only 1/2 of your acreage is mine". You still disagree. He says " you're not being reasonable, you won't even accept a simple compromise."

I am with you, and as a complete and avowed conspiracist, I think the polemic being written by blocksize increase (presently incarnated as BitCoinXT) proponents stinks of [JTRIG]( type manipulation.

What would cause deflation in the dollar? Presumably only an increase in supply of goods increasing dollar purchasing power. But I find it difficult to see how that goes hyper-deflationary. Maybe significant advancements in automation and wide spread decrease in materials cost. The only other method I immediately see would be widespread destruction of dollars on the books. So large currency holders and central banks just writing off currency as though it was destroyed and not replaced.

No it isn't. Its still increasing the block size. The small blocker's interests are completely denied. A compromise would look like "let small blockers try to address scalability issues via alternative methods (sidechain, lightning network, etc.), if after an agreed upon time-frame, scalability is not addressed, then let us consider a larger block size." That's a compromise because both party's interests are addressed and integrated in to the attempted solution.


If you claimed my property was yours I would refer the matter to arms. No third party arbitration necessary. Additionally, it is nonsense to think the "majority" determines property rights. Any claims made against my property by the majority can only be exercised via violence. 
Further, why should an engineering solution be beholden to "majority" decisions? The majority of bitcoin users are not technically capable of determining the effects caused by a change in block size. That means the vast number of proponents to changing the block size are simply noise and fury signifying nothing.

I was with you till phantom menace \s. But good analogy! It seems that the only way to build robustly is to be truly decentralized with actors using verifiably uncompromised tools. Flaws become targets. A diverse code ecology can quickly patch and immunize itself against infection, while the same infection may be devastating for a monocultural code ecology.

Gonna third (at present) this sentiment. I bought his book "Mastering Bitcoin" and its just without peer with respect to learning the technical portion of bitcoin.

Is a full node similar to seeders on a torrent file? New nodes are leeches until they synchronize their blockchain? Are there any organizations funding new node development via bitcoin? For instance, maintain and run a node, get paid X bitcoin per month? I am new to this (read the whitepaper and a bunch of articles) and am trying to get a better understanding of how it all works.
