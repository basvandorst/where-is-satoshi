I figured I would jump on this one.  Just tried SD for the first time off my blockchain.  Am I supposed to do anything different than send the bet to the bet ID and wait?  
Do I need a special setup for return winnings?  (I realize pretty noob questions).  Thanks!

My bet is $45-55 range by January '14.  There is a saturation point that the BTC market will reach which is not a bad thing.  It is the sign of a rapidly maturing market.

Great listen.  Thanks for posting!

Would it be possible to provide links on the new website?  
I found this to be incredibly helpful when I first started: [cbtnuggets](

You might be right.  I was under the impression the actual identity "Satoshi Nakamoto" isn't real so even if an individual tied their ID to a known, old address it wouldn't be 100%.

While ASICS will push out the GPU/FPGA crowd, the cost of ASICS makes them just as democratizing IMO.

any updates????

This is great!  thanks for the info:)

Great post Snake

I don't think you are going to see a sizable correction.  That said, Sunday's in the US are the best times to buy via coinbase.  Market is deflated and low volume pushes prices down 60-75 cents.  
Again, I don't foresee a "correction".  BTC is fair value right now.

HAHAHAHA.  You Sir/Madam are a stalker:)
I obviously forsake my dreams of a day trader and have held on for the ride.  I sit on a small stack of coins and plan to cash out about 70% at 280-300 to pay off ALL my debt.   
Again, not a big position taker.  Thanks for taking notice of my terrible forecast:)

Dare I ask?
What is BFX?

Seriously fantastic move that shouldn't go unnoticed or unrecognized.  Reddit community bring this he/she/toaster/horse to the top of the ladder!

Even if that's not true - It made me smile:)

All these are good comments (btw, wtf: where is [Grooveshark] ( ?) and yet miss where music streaming/porno/gaming need to take bitcoins:
It is all about the micro-purchase. For the same reason someone will play bitvegas (great minecraft world btw) they will pay that .01 for a premium product.  I always thought it would be a cool idea to allow bands to raise money for gigs/records/events/etc in a medium like grooveshark.  Bitcoin could be a tremendous catalyst for movements like these.  Free money and free capital.

Use gold!  what...wut?

It would be interesting to know how many miners/mining pools on the .8 were affected.

sooooo.....what does the shipping box look like?

I tell you, I consider myself a nerd/techno-geek and was SORELY embarrassed when I discovered Bitcoin (4 Feb).  I bought a little bit and have held on for the ride. 
I strongly believe its a big shot or a zero.  It's still in beta!  Best of luck on any investments you make (Bitcoin or otherwise).

Is that really an endorsement?  Almost sounded like some blunt-force trauma sarcasm.

Just made a bet:)  I'll let you know how it goes!

Completely off subject so my apologies:
Just used SD for first time w/ a blockchain wallet.  Are there any compatibility issues or alt addresses I need to set up?  Haven't seen any confirmations yet.  Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:23:07

Nice review!  In your next video, would you mind elaborating more on the single's casing or the relative size if 60 gh/s will be in multiple units?   
Trying to figure out how I'm going to mount it:)  Thanks!

unless a national entity saw btc's as a threat to their central bank.  Also, if they saw it as cheaper to buy BTC's and crash it then combat illicit traficking...

Exact same thing happened to me yesterday.

I've been unable to send btc to my blockchain from my coinbase.  The transaction will sit there "pending" for over 24 hours, after which it just disappears and the balance resets.  (I don't believe I am short BTC's though
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:48:26
@_date: 2013-02-12 14:28:54
Keep an eye on the blue.  If the price stays below 26USD for a day or so, you could see 25USD as a relatively strong resistance point.   
-or not

This is big.  Between Amazon integration and MtGox/coinlab news, the next 30 days of trading should be pretty interesting:)
