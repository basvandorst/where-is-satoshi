Diversification is key. About 10% of my savings and retirement are in bitcoin at age 34. I’d love for it to be the asset that really makes me some money in the long run. But I still have to play it safe. Hell, my 401 is up 20% for the year.

I get that totally. I had this same conversation with a friend last night. He and I are investing in the same areas but I don’t own any gold or precious metals. He does. I argue that it isn’t easy for anyone to carry or split an ounce of gold. However, he reminds me that all of it is a gamble and diversification is key to financial freedom.

What the fuck was this article? I read it a few minutes ago and then came to this sub to see if anyone else had read it. Great journalism.

Yea. That's what I finally realized.

I did too.

I had always wished that I had gotten in in BTC when it was cheaper. Considering how cheap it's been the last few months, I thought now was the time to get in on it and try to at least get 1 BTC to hodl. I just had a feeling that BTC was about to take off a little again and I didn't want to regret it. I think it's a mental thing for me to have 1 whole BTC.
