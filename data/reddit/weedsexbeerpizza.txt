My coworker asked me how much Bitcoin I had. I told him as much as possible. It is a currency/asset.
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:29:22
I hear you and agree. Just wanted to point out that it isn't better ROI in the long run. But DCA is the way to go cause we're crazy monkeys.
@_date: 2019-07-14 06:35:33
I already lost mine and I'm not even married yet.
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:24:20
The way you used "better" is vague. Better for your psyche probably but investing a lump sum gives a better return in long term.

Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck about your technical analysis.
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:43:51
I'm a noob. So no experience here as I have yet to hold during a halving. But I'd recommend looking for the previous price chart with the halving events divided clearly.

I like that TA exists but it's funny when people pretend it's an exact science. Especially in Crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:32:39
As a former losing card player the best thing to me is that 1 BTC will always equal 1BTC. Even when you lose money, you don't lose until if/when you cash out.

As much as I can afford on a regular cadence. That's probably the most specific answer you're going to get. Everyone's income/risk is different.

I think BTC will end the week close to either 8k or 12.5k.
@_date: 2019-09-16 08:21:49
Low volatility for Bitcoin relatively. How long can we hang between 9 and 11k?
@_date: 2019-09-02 01:23:32
Other than time, what does Bitcoin need to breakout? In your opinion obviously.
@_date: 2019-09-06 21:00:57

Bitcoin will move lower slowly until people start buying it more. Then the price will not be as low.
