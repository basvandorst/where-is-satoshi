This is utter nonsense. 
You are talking about the absolutely rational decisions which are obviously made by the Bitcoin community and claim they were the result of some fictional conspiracy.
The mere fact that you have to promote a fork which does not happen however much a small minority may scream for it tells clearly that the market has indeed made its decision.

@_date: 2016-08-29 15:52:44
With all due respect, your post is a listing of nonsense.
Nowhere is blockstream controlling Bitcoin's development or claiming "benelovence" even if you put that word in quotation marks to make it look like you were actually quoting them, which is clearly a lie.
Also you claim to somehow speak for "a majority of users" even though it is crystal clear that the majority of users wants the block size to stay small because otherwise we would have already increased it. That easy.
Also everybody with a brain has understood that there is no way to scale Bitcoin to mass adoption by increasing the blocksize and that we need 2nd layers and sidechains to do so. This was clear years ago and I am very grateful that the Bitcoin core devs are working on precisely that despite people like you slaundering them the way you are doing it.
You are describing a fantasy land there. You are either misled by the FUD that confuses OP or you are part of the campaign spreading that FUD.

Roger is there as an "advisor" but whoever follows his advises is gonna have a bad time.
"MtGox is solvent!" is just one example and if his predictions in regards to the blocksize issue would have had any relation to reality Bitcoin would actually not exist anymore.

You have obviously not read me yet when I was angry ;). 
Clearly: the post I was answering to did not "want to verify social influence" which does of course exist. You and I and everybody here has "social influence" on Bitcoin. But the post to which I was answering to stated "control over Bitcoin's development by Blockstream". Do you understand the difference?
And yes, I refuse to try to argue the non-existence of said control over the Bitcoin development as much as I refuse to discuss the non-existence of the control of an old gentleman with a big white beard living in the sky over my fate. Both claims need to be backed up with some evidence and both claims cannot come up with that however often they may be repeated.


I did not imply I would speak for anyone else but me. All I pointed out is the obvious: if a majority of Bitcoin hodlers would want a blocksize increase then we would have had a blocksize increase by now. To claim (like the poster I replied to did) that there is somehow a majority here that "demands" an increase is just plainly ignoring the obvious. If the poster I replied to would believe that himself he would simply fork off because he would know the majority would follow him. He does not fork though because he knows he will be very alone on his fork then. That and nothing else tells you "what users want".


I believe you are wrong here. In order to keep Bitcoin decentralised we should actually aim not for a bigger, but a smaller blocksize. Actually we'd need a negative blocksize. Yes, that's a number with a "-" ("minus") in front of it.


I have read the post I was replying to again but I still believe that my reaction to it was rather held back. In my opinion the poster either has no clue what he is talking about or he is spreading nonsense on purpose. I gave some sound advise for both options.
@_date: 2016-04-04 15:19:10

Pls see my answer to this post which I would define as pure FUD.
Unfortunately you will have to go deeper into this rabbit hole and find the answer to your question yourself as there is obviously a campaign being run that wants people to believe that Bitcoin is broken and under the control of evil powers. Take yourself the time to learn about the allegedly evil actors being blamed in this campaign and what they are working on and then make up your own mind. 
For someone new coming to this community at the moment it is hard to see through the fog, which is a goal of that campaign I guess.

Thank you for coming out and responding here!
As a customer support representative can you understand why I start doubting the integrity of PIA after seeing that your head of privacy is publishing evident non-truths and then using block explorer.com, which is now part of your company, to campaign for a fishy altcoin that aims at "destroying Bitcoin"?
How am I supposed to trust a company whose employees are spreading proven lies with my privacy?
Please note that I have been a PIA customer for many years and that I am honestly concerned about this.
@_date: 2016-04-10 17:36:41
That is a bit shortsighted I believe, because of of course every merchant who pays the fees has to recover them with the price of his products so in the end of course the customer pays.

The problem is that the funds you put in there are not in your control anymore so you cannot be sure that you can take them out again.
The money stolen from my card was only in the account because I had put it in there to be able to withdraw fiat cash while abroad. Unfortunately I could not get the money out myself while in Spain (ATMs just refused the card) while for some reason someone else was able to take the money without having the card in the US a few days later.
So my advise would be to only put money there when you need it to be there (like you wanna use it for online shopping right now or for immediate cash withdrawal) and if that does not work block the card immediately online so nobody else can take it either.

1. You will have to get used to the idea that some other coin than Bitcoin will overtake Bitcoin in the short and medium term. The simple reason for this is that "the masses" who are falsely expected to adopt Bitcoin some time soon do not give a shit about freedom and decentralization and all that idealistic stuff that drives us Bitcoiners. They will go for the centralized "crypto" that is being recommended to them by their bank and Ripple has quite some potential to become that coin.
2. Only if Bitcoin stays decentralized and shows its economic advantages over a centralized coin in the long term "the masses" will move over to Bitcoin.
3. Imagine yourself as a bear standing in a river and the fat salmons are jumping right into your wide open mouth. Next to you stands another bear doing the same. Why would you be jealous about the salmon the other guy gets as long as you get your's?

If you wanna do actual business how would you justify NOT to do that on a sidechain of the most secure blockchain that makes sure whatever fuckup happens on the sidechain the funds will just fall byk to the mainchain and no value can be lost instead of putting real money on a chain that has had multiple bugs, lost hundreds of millions of dollars and has proven to be not immutable in the way it should be?
Not to mention the monetary aspects of both native coins.
I don't think code can be moved in an instant but I suggest that the fundametals of Bitcoin are incentive enough to see more and more EVM stuff happening on Bitcoin in the very near future.

@_date: 2017-12-27 15:01:04
I do not recall having called anyone stupid.
The person I responded to is fantasizing about "centralized institutions" that take "large fees" off him. He might as well claim that the grass is going to turn blue when lightning is being adopted. There is no point in arguing any of these claims as the person I responded to is either deliberately spreading fud or so unknowing that a discussion with him does not make any sense unless he educates himself first.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:22:54
No worries about the seed as you do of course create your own new wallet on the device.
I would rather worry that if you buy a used hardware wallet the firmware might have been manipulated. 
Not sure how likely that is and if hardware wallets have a mechanism to detect manipulation. Maybe someone else can clarify that.

It is worth mentioning though that Satoshi came up with the idea of payment channels, albeit the idea was not thought through yet back then:

How could one calculate that?
@_date: 2018-09-11 12:30:58
The notion that "cash" neccessarily consists of coins and paper bills is wrong, at least outdated.
The properties that make a money "cash" are:
it can be transferred without a middleman
the receiver can validate the transaction on the spot
the transaction is irreversible
Those were the requirements for something to be called "digital cash" since the nineties when that vision was developed.
Fiat cash and Bitcoin both fulfill these requirements.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:28:27
They already discussed that because users demanded lightning to be implemented on bcash. Fakesatoshi publicly told the developer that he would not allow that though.
Can't make that stuff up.

There are no "both sides".
There is Bitcoin and there is a group of scammers trying to trick people into a fake Bitcoin in order to safe the mining cartell's asicboost advantage over their customers and in order to centralize the network under their control.
I am sorry that you are desperate and fearful but there is no need to. Bitcoin has had its greatest year yet this year in my opinion. It broke the standstill in scaling development, we have some unbelievable optimizations being rolled out, the world has woken up to it, it has defended itself against China bans, fork attacks and central banker's bashings and what not. And with UASF and NO2X its users have demonstrated in a very impressing way that this technology is steered by users not by CEOs.
And even if this correction takes us down to 2k it will still be worth two times as much as a year ago.
As a long time Bitcoin enthusiast I have a big fat satisfied grin on my face.

@_date: 2017-12-08 21:10:09
 &gt; So I don't see this as a problem if the network is distributed among companies and not decentralized to every users.
Bitcoin was literally invented to avoid exactly that.
Once Bitcoin gets under central control there will be no difference to Paypal or other commercial services. The bcash people are fine with that though.
@_date: 2018-09-03 21:53:28
And I say "Two Bitcoin is worth 14.300 bucks."
Like I say "two Euro" and not "Euros". And before that I said "two mark" and not "two marks". 
But maybe herein lies the answer because the Americans say "two dollars" and the English say "two pounds" so if you come from a country where people do it that way it might feel more natural to you to use the plural while for me it really sounds stupid. And the other way around. :)

If you start caring more about the potential and advantages of Bitcoin instead of it's price it will automatically leave 20k far behind and go much higher.

Inbetween your insults and ranting I found the following actual statement:


In regards to this I need to tell you that you are wrong.
Like every licensed bitcoinbank Coinbase is deploying extensive blockchain analyses in order to find out every detail about the origin of their customer's money and where that money goes.
The Bitcoin blockchain allows them to do that much more in detail than any traditional bank could ever dream of. 
Source: I personally attended meetings between bitcoinbanks and financial regulators and this topic is basically the only one that matters on these meetings.
Please learn about Bitcoin and you will understand why!
Again thank you for your kind reply!

Merchant here having accepted Bitcoin 0-conf transactions for many years. No double spend problems. We are a bar and restaurant and if anyone wants to cheat their bill they would rather just leave in the right moment instead of trying to double spend and have their faces remembered.
This will probably change the mor Bitcoin is being adopted but by now we accept lightning payments and there is no way to double spend and no need for confirmations.
The claim that bcash transactions are somehow secure from double spending without confirmations is pure marketing nonsense.

I see. I was thinking of / talking about the prepaid cards that you load up by sending Bitcoin to your payment service provider (as I have one of those).
I don't leave money on banks like Coinbase so I don't know about how these bank accounts are being managed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:49:50
Come on do some research!
Install a wallet (I recommend electrum but there are plenty of them to be found on bitcoin.org), learn how to use it and most importantly make backups and then take your money away from the bank into your own hands! 
It will take a little time and effort but after all that is what Bitcoin was made for and that is what empowers you.

There is a new bcash pump scheduled for today.

I totally discourage everybody from using exchanges so hey!?
I think you and I come from different perspectives. 
I believe in building a digital, decentralized, censorhip resistent bearer money Bitcoin is doing amazing and that was the plan all along.
This was unimaginable a decade ago and it is entirelly irrelevant who accepts it now or who doesn't.
I can understand though that some people who came in for some profit at the last ATH are a bit sour grapes now. But that happened at every new ATH in the past and it will keep happening.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:40:58
They are indeed two entirely seperate things.
The bcash thing has been created by a group of scammers who called it "Bitcoin cash" so people get confused and can be tricked into buying their copy of Bitcoin instead of Bitcoin.
This is possible because Bitcoin is not a company with copyrights and trademarks but an open source network.

All attempts to increase the blocksize aim at making it harder for people to run their own nodes and be their own bank. That's why all the banks push for bigger blocks. 
They NEED a centralized network because in a free and completely decentralized one they cannot exist. The huge blocks promoted by fakebitcoin ("bit coin cash") will forever prevent you from running your own node and drive you into the caring arms of a bank. Coinbasebank wants to be the one you choose.

A short is a tool to hedge risk in the first place. 
If you want to grow grain and want to sell it in autumn at a certain price that you need then you can short grain and in case its price depreciates by autumn you will recover your loss by profiting from the short position.
A short is literally an insurance.

Get your own wallet that holds your own private keys. Transfer your coins out of Coinbasebank.
I recommend electrum but you will find a nice choice of wallets on bitcoin.org.
Try them out and find your favourite. Spend some time on that. Not only become the ultimate master over your own money but at the same time learn about the most innovative technology seen for a while. Share your knowledge and educate others!
Make sure you have a proper backup!
And congrats on buying the dip! :)
@_date: 2018-09-02 08:01:06
I don't think it will be the sole solution either. 
But it is an already functioning solution, evidently functioning as I can see from a merchant point of view. Not some abstract mambo jambo. We received those transactions tonight in a surprisingly reliable matter in a highly chaotic saturday night bar environment and we have those coins in our wallet without having to wait for confirmations, without having to bother the blockchain and with actually much better privacy than with onchain transactions.
I admit that made me a bit enthusiastic. :)
@_date: 2018-09-03 22:34:01
Let me clarify:
when I said that I had centralized fiat to Bitcoin exchanges in mind as I am right now discussing about Coinbase in another thread simultaniously.
But such centralized exchanges connected to the legacy financial system are not needed for price discovery and magical internet tickers anyway.
@_date: 2018-09-03 21:36:16
As a matter of fact an intermeiary cannot survive in a disintermediated world which is what Bitcoin is aiming at and as Coinbase is an intermediary Bitcoin's success will inevitably be Coinbase's end.

It has always been like that and it will always stay like that. I said that before:

But that's the beauty of this. We are getting A scaling solution that does NOT change the base layer and thus does in no way threaten to break Bitcoin's nine year track record of stability but it does still work perfectly fine, evidently even in a real world scenario.
And it is only at its beginning and it is nothing that we cannot easily change and develop or replace if neccessary without messing with the Bitcoin protocol.
For me that really is evidence that the strategy to scale offchain was exactly the right way to go.

Beyond 100 billion dollars in there, it is on the way to becoming a houshold name in many parts of the world, all this cutting edge development, every stupid gubment on the planet thinks they need to regulate it but they can't, every stupid bank tries to somehow get it under control and our formerly sweet little community is now called an "industry".
Bitcoin is a freakshit crazy success all along.
What is this nonsense?

Which dip do you mean?
Funnily enough both are in a dip, the Pound as well as Silver.
And also: this calculation is flawed beyond the fact that there are different ounzes and pounds in existence. This comparison does not take into account that the Pound Sterling stood for Sterling, which is 95% Silver and 5% scrap metal. So someone pls re-calculate.

Before the talk I told them to install doegerain. I know I will be downvoted now as a heretic but that one does exactly what you want we don't have anything similar for Bitcoin. After my talk I made it rain.
When your talk is good they will not stop listening but the person after you must be prepared that half the audience will be ending dogecoin back and forth during their presentation ;).
Just tell them they can swap this stuff for Bitcoin online, then many of them will register with the exchange of their choice as well hence taking the first step to buy Bitcoin too.

One cannot do anything useful with a private blockchain really, at least nobody has figured anything out yet.
Private / permissioned blockchains are just legacy institutions trying to find out how they can stay somehow relevant by using the new technology.

Yes all that is true and it would mean that "mainstream" is gonna use "Paypal2.0" as Roger Ver has named it already.
Bitcoin though is about a decentralized digital bearer asset. 
Bitcoin does not care what mainstream uses and neither do I. I already have what i wanted with Bitcoin and I never dared to hope that the rest of humanity will want to escape the banking slavery. "Mainstream" will feel fine using whatever as long as it is based on "blockchain" and gives them some innovation like faster transactions, no matter how centralized that blockchain is.
But that's mainstream's business, not mine. And not Bitcoin's business either.

The only strategy where that makes sense is when you take a loan, buy Bitcoin with the money, default on the loan and keep the unconfiscatable asset, preferably in a secret way.
----&gt; This is NOT a recommendation &lt;----
Other than that I think it's smarter to work for and with Bitcoin and grow with the technology instead of going into debt for it.

I don't think we can convince the whole of humanity to understand and not to mention use a free monetary system based on bleeding edge innovative technology. Not your grandma and not mine either, ever.
In the meantime folks like you and me can use that system and achieve monetary freedom and financial self empowerment and the economic advantages we thereby get will slowly and over time convince the rest that this might be a good idea.

The risk-free-ness of bonds is a myth which is likely to blow in the not so distant future.
OTOH we don't have a clue yet what kind of Bitcoin-investment / buying power Dapps will attract but obviously the more capable / functional Bitcoin is, the more money will flow into it.
Taking your example of the bond market: a huge portion of the money in bonds comes from retirement funds. Millions of people relying on their absurdly indebted governments to pay them back in a few decades. Now try to imagine how competitive a p2p retirement savings plan with totally transparent funds (actual funds, not IOUs!) held absolutely securely on the blockchain and without the fees to be paid to banks would be. It would for sure grab a huge portion of the bond market.
But for this to happen we do exactly need the additional capabilities in Bitcoin that you mention. Also pls keep in mind that whatever we do on sidechains does in no way influence the security of the Bitcoin mainchain.

What happened is what has always happened in Bitcoin after the exchange rate going vertical: it always comes back down again.
Pls look at the historical charts and you will see that exactly this has happened half a dozen or more times before. This decline is not (yet) even the worst, we have seen it go down more than 90 percent before (like from 20 EUR down to far below 2).
In Bitcoin this is normal for everybody who has been watching it for a while. It is only new to the noobs and they can only get hurt by it when they buy something that they did not research before buying in at or near a new ATH.

I like your optimism but why would the institutional Bitcoin investor be smarter than the institutional gold investor who accepts an IOU on gold instead of the actual gold even though they can see that COMEX for example is giving out hundreds of times more IOUs than they have gold in their vault?
For many years I said this could never happen in Bitcoin because the reasons for it to happen with gold do not apply to Bitcoin (the whole physical delivery and storage). But by now I believe that for the institutional investor holding their private keys is as much a pain in the ass for them as it is to take care of physical gold. 
For so many years gold bugs have expected the price for physical gold to decouple from the price discovered in the derivative markets (where the price is being negotiated by someone who sells something that does not exist to someone who does not want to have it) but it never happened.
How can we avoid this to happen in the Bitcoin market in your opinion?

I wholeheaertedly disagree.
I think it is not at all a good thing to have a middleman establish itself as a payments provider with a near monopoly in the early development of the market for the first digital bearer asset built to function without a middleman.
If other companies who want to accept Bitcoin look at examples like this they will do just the same as "this is the way it'S done obviously."
And after all we have already seen how Bitpay aims to expand its influence on this movement with things like S2X and their stupid payment protocol nonsense.
An intemediary for Bitcoin payments is one of the most stupid developments around and to cheer its success is something I find outright bizzare.

Yes. We document all Bitcoin transactions very thoroughly for the tax authorities and cross check them every night. We had not one that didn't go through even if it sometimes takes a while because some iphone user sends one without a fee. We still let them go because from our experience we know it will turn up some time later that night.

If you want to be informed beforehand you will need to subscribe to our VIP/insider trading newsletter. 
You can do so by sending 1 Bitcoin to
1Ross5Np5doy4ajF9iGXzgKaC2Q3Pwwxv and then a message signed with the private key of the sending address to me via pm here.
From then on you will always know next week's Bitcoin price today already.

Please don't let the twisted logic of the Rand / Greenspan camp put you off a healthy egoism.
To understand philosophical egoism (as described by Max Stirner) has influenced me a lot in regards to being happy to help others out for the simple reason that an egoist with a brain will at some stage inevitably understand that the better his fellow human beings are off the better he will do himself and that the more helpful he was to other people the more help he will be given in return when in need.

Hi, Joerg here from ROOM77.
Just to clarify: this is not yet another Bitcoin ATM, it is the world's first open-access Bitcoin-community hardware trading-plattform (OABCHTP ;)).
anyone can put their coins on the machine and by providing cryptographic proof of ownership of the sending address they can collect their money without having to provide their biographic identity.

"It only sells bitcoin. It doesn't buy them"
Well yes and no. 
The title of this thread is misleading, It's not crowd funded but what we call 'open access'. That means anyone from the local community can put their coins on the machine and, once the coins are sold, come around and pick up their cash.
No ID needed, just cryptographic proof of ownership of the sending address.
So the machine DOES buy the Bitcoin from people in the neighbourhood. Kinda like time shifted. 
What it does not allow ist spontaniously going to the machine, putting Bitcoin in and getting out cash instantly. But then that would be nothing I would like to offer ;).

Well first of all the Bitcoin protocol is not "run" by anyone but it is being developed in a collaborative, open and completely transparent process delivering open source software and it is the users themselves who decide if they want to run it or not.
Second of all Bitcoin is under a massive attack from people who think it is a good idea to centralize the network under their control. That's the big block campaign and you can find evidence that this campaign does not mind centralizing the network (search for 'roger ver paypal 2.0' or watch some videos from the Satoshi-imposter Craig Wright promoting 'banks and corporations' to do the validating for the users).
That camp is smearing Bitcoin with the utmost absurd conspiracy theories about how the Bilderberger and AXA have somehow infiltrated this open source project and how this diverse unorganized group of hundreds of developers have all been corrupted.
In order to see through all this fog you will need to research and learn a lot for yourself. Be warned that this rabbit hole is very deep but once you get to the bottom of it you will be able to see clearly that 'outrageous lies' really are only deployed by the side attacking Bitcoin and not from Bitcoin (Bitcoin as an open source project does not even have the marketing budget the dotcom side has at its disposal).
And please don't fall for the claim that this sub is censored and full of illuminati sockpuppets. I myself have been banned from the fake Bitcoin sub (which uses Bitcoin's ticker symbol but is all about a centralized altcoin that actually has a different ticker symbol) and I have been called a sockpuppet myself multiple times including by a user account that has lateron litererally turned out to be a sockpuppet account of the chief writer of bitcoin dotcom.
So there you go for a start. I wish you a nice journey into all of this! ;)

Well if you think that having to spend 5 minutes to only set up an account on the machine isn't slow (it takes 15 seconds to have the coins  onto your phone from a lamassu that does not ask for ID) is not slow and that giving up your biometric data is no inconvenience then these things are obviously relative ;).
I never said I "want the masses to accept it", I don't quite care about any masses, but I find it a pretty strange marketing concept to try to disguise disruptive technological innovation "in a way that everyone is familiar with". You are actually saying that we should demand identities in the Bitcoin ecosystem because people are used to have their identities demanded by the legacy financial system.
That's absurd.

That is not correct.
Zimbabwe dollars are merely worth the heating power of the paper they're printed on. Other than that they have a certain collector's value on E-Bay, but none in Zimbabwe.
As for German Mark: the coins from the Kaiser- and the Nazi-times have a silver value and only some very rare ones have an additional numismatic (collector's-) value. The "Deutschmark" from after the war still has a guaranteed exchange rate to the EURO if you bring it to the Central Bank as long as the country exists in it's current political form.
So the only Dollars still being worth something in case the Dollar crashes will be old coins that still cointain silver or gold. But those are already out of circulation and in the hands of pm-bugs.

The question is if somebody is advertising it as a service and thus promising said service at certain times or if you just read about it somewhere and went to the hackspace where it is set up.
We have people here who complain about not getting a service which was never offered to them in the first place because they read about a machine here in the news. 
The news alo said that we have it for a while to experiment and research and develop stuff, we never said we would run this as a service still people turn up here and demand access to a running machine topped up with lots of coins as if anybody had sold them that and they had some sort of right to it.

We are a zero-confirmation and zero-chargeback company.
We had one chargeback though something like two years ago when a customer who was allergic to peanuts hadn't realised that there is peanut-butter on our Jimmy-Carter-Burger. So we took back the Jimmy-Carter and served a Fidel-Castro to make the customer happy.
Btw did you know that since Ronald Reagan has announced the war on terror more US citizens have died due to allergic reactions to peanuts than through terrorist attacks?

Elections behind closed doors into which you need to buy in by paying 1 BTC, resulting in 5 people declaring a guy 'general secretary' who bullshitted everybody by claiming a facebook group he had just clicked together was an incorporated national organisation. He is even using a fake name (which he did before and which resulted in the German Pirate Party having real legal problems after he was kicked out as he had signed official papers using his fake name) and who publically demands the western world to go out on a crusade against Islam and bomb the shit out of countries like Iran.

You only ask yourself these questions because you can see your transactions in your wallet. In your old analogue cash wallet you did not see them after you spent the money. It's like every coffee you pay with fiat cash would leave a little note in your physical wallet saying "3 USD spent on this date". If you'd go through them after a few weeks you also would not remember what you spent this money on but you do still trust yourself not having made a mistake back then.
Do you write down and record every single cash payment made with fiat, like every coffee you buy?

Especially with Dogerain it is a great way to introduce people to the concept of cryptocurrencies and let them have some (even though pretty worthless) coins to play around in a fun way. Check my post here:
Another example is a permanent Dogerain faucet we have installed over our bar, meaning anyone in our bar who has Dogerain open on their phone keeps getting coins sent to it / rained on them. It's fun, it's free and people can even exhchange them for a few satoshis online (well if they stay long enough ;)).

I am afraid in most jurisdictions you are being forced by law to accept the legal tender fiat money. You may accept Bitcoin (or any other currency) only in addition to that.
You could maybe circumvent this by setting up an atm where people can pay in fiat for the coins but you will need a lawyer to work out the legal structure (maybe people need to join some kind of association when they enter your bar) and to find out what kind of licence you need to have for setting up the atm.

I was lucky to get my hands on one of the metal ones which were pre delivered a few months ago. I activated it and tried it out with the mytrezor wallet and that literally left me with a big smile on my face.

The machine was only tolerated for two months by the German Bundesbank under the condition that we deploy it uncommercially, take no fees, for research and development and demonstration purposes only.
The answer to the question what license would be necessary in order to run it commercially was never given.
So the reason that there are no atms and no localbitcoins in Germany is not over-regulation but rather under-regulation, meaning "we don't tell you what you need to do it but if you do it we will start investigating against you".
For this reason Germany has lost its head start in Bitcoin by now and is suffering an innovation flight precisely as I have predicted it a couple of years ago when I testified about Bitcoin at the parliament.

They don't carry out the transaction for you, at no time do they hold your money.
They are necessary service providers who confirm your transaction. And as long as they are not centralized into one entity no miner can stop your transaction getting confirmed because there will always be a miner happy to take your transaction fee.
So I would say no.

I just gave it a try:
Digital cash is supposed to be a digital equivalent to our legacy physical cash (coins and banknotes).
Therefor digital cash needs to fulfill certain criteria:
- payments can be made without a middleman
- the receiver has a means of verifying the transaction and be sure that they have been paid
- the transaction cannot be reversed
These criteria are met no matter if I hand you a banknote or send you a Bitcoin transaction. They also create privacy and non-confiscatability as no middlemen carry out the transaction for you or hold your money for you.

Dear Madames and Sirs!
I am German (based in Berlin) and right now in the planning of a bigger holiday with family and friends in Bangladesh. Unfortunately these quite confusing news just made headlines:
As we are all (of course) users of Bitcoin (and the internet even) I would like to ask you if we will have any legal problems when travelling to Bangladesh. 
Would we be in legal trouble if we held any Bitcoin private keys or other access codes or if we used Bitcoin to pay bills at home or for online services? Or maybe for having anything to do with the technology alltogether maybe?
It would be great if you could let us know what to do in order to be able to safely enter Bangladesh and leave again (if at all possible). Without having that safety we will have to look for another holiday destination.
With best thanks and best regards!

If someone else's opinion is that 1+1 does not equal 2 and that 2 is not more than 1 then I dismiss that opinion straight away because basic math has got nothing to do with opinion. That much for the centralization pressure on nodes.
If anyone thinks that powerful players in a market will not abuse more power given to them to drive out competition, well, then I can accept that as an opinion but that opinion is so naive that I dismiss it straight away too. That much for decentralization pressure on mining.
The first point is math and the second point is common sense based on experience. No opinion needed for me to say what I said. Or to understand it for that matter.

I know quite a few people who were like "Oh shit why did I not buy at 300EUR!?" when it was a 1.000EUR. When we were back down at 300 I told them here's your chance but they all did not want to buy into it since the price was falling.

If you didn't know that I can explain:
BU builds centralization pressure on miners as larger miners have the power to determine the entry barriers to the mining market. That is exactly the old centralized world where bank lobbies determine the entry barriers to the banking market.
And BU builds centralization pressure on nodes as it makes it harder to run a node and forces more and more people to use Bitcoin banks like coinbase or blockchain.info. Whoever does not see it that way does not go through the pains of actually running a node and having to handle that beast of a blockchain.

You did so at a time when they were only producing blocks the size Bitcoin allows anyway. Try to do so when there's blocks coming 10, 20 or 100 times as big as they are now. 


I do not quite recall "classic" or "xt" or whatever other attempts were there to takeover Bitcoin, so bear with me for not comparing them for you.
In "BU" though, miners and Bitcoin banks can use the mechanism of "emergent consensus" to raise the blocksize so that smaller miners cannot compete anymore and so that nodes are ever harder to run anywhere on the planet and thus centralize the network so we all have to use banks like coinbase or blockchain.info in order to find out if we have been paid and having to trust those banks. That's why those banks are so desperate for a blocksize increase. After all they have to satisfy their business plans.
In BU larger miners have more to say than smaller ones do and Bitcoin banks have more to say than my personal node has. That is the mechanism that is being tried to introduce here.
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:17:30
Who is "we"?
The Bitcoin community quite obviously does not want an increase of the blocksize because otherwise they would run BUcoin or they would have run XTcoin or Classiccoin or whatnot.

With Bitcoin it is possible to build platforms that offer permanent proof of reserves. It will take a while for people to understand that and the difference that makes.

They are really two completely concepts of money.
Bitcoin is a much better money than the USD or any other fiat money already quality wise but than can only be achieved without a nation state "backing it" or "enforcing it" as I would rather say.
So buying into Bitcoin is more something one does when one believes in the superiority of that kind of concept of money and thus in its future potential.
Having understood that the USD derives its economic success from its position as the world reserve currency and that this position is about to change probably helps.

It is coded into the protocol that every roughly 12 months someone else is being discovered as Satoshi by the media.
Time intervals vary a lot though as one of the parameters defining them is media attention (like block intervals vary depending on current mining power), which fluctuates (like mining power).
The actual reason behind the current block size debate btw is that some people want to change the protocol so that one Satoshi can be declared the true one once and forever, which is basically an effort to re-import the function of a "throne" from ancient protocols to Bitcoin.

Please acknowledge that back in the days to use Bitcoin meant to run a full node (the only client available) and that meant that you would also very much likely mine with that. The original concept means that every user is also a miner (not even for profit but because we all need to secure that network we're using) and the development towards specialised mining entities is part of the evolution.
So back then there was no reason to tell people not to try mining.

That is not true. I am speaking about repeated attempts following the same patterns aiming for the same goal which is to centralize development, nodes and now mining too.

A paid subredit with paid moderators and a commercial adbanner campaign and paid retweets and deep pockets to pay out non economical miner rewards. "No governors or supporters or money"? So grassroots. 
As I said: maybe these attempted coups are not coordinated and maybe the people behind them are not evil. Maybe they just feel better with leadership and guidance to help them out of their confusion. Whatever.

Let me try:
Your node is connected to a bunch of other nodes. Whenever your node hears about a new transaction on the network it first validates it by checking: 
- does the sender actually have the amount they wish to send?
- can the sender proof they are authorized to send the money?
- is the receiving address an actual Bitcoin address that can receive it?
Your node can do this using the copy of the blockchain it holds and the cryptographic functions implemented in the protocol. If doing so your node comes to the conclusion that the transaction is valid it relays that transaction to its connected nodes which do the whole shebang again.
What a miner does additionally is kinda to grab the current state of the ledger including all the yet unconfirmed valid transactions and put that in a new block, which it then relays to all the other nodes and miners.
While all participants of the network check the accounting and validate transactions, miners also create a copy of the state of everything every ten minutes and put it in a folder from which nothing can ever be erased again.

I don't know and I don't care if the people trying to push BTU, which I believe is total madness, are evil or just stupid but I do interpret the repeated attempts to push Bitcoin into centralized hands as attempts to take it over.
If I go into paranoid mode I think "well that'd be the best and most promising way to try to get Bitcoin under control". If I go into naive mode I think "well that's utter madness and needs to be stopped before shit breaks". In hindsight we had some pretty troubling situations (like with XT and MH on banker's payroll while pushing to become our "benelovent dictator").

Because by now enough people have understood what a desaster of a suggestion BTU is. That last bug underscored that fact and also the public discussions about how unsafe that fork to buggy code has been prepared.
Alone by refusing to implement replay attack protection the BTU devs have more or less stated that they just want to inflict as much damage as possible to everyone, even the people who believed in them.
The support this is getting from the biggest miners shows exactly the centralization pressure BTU puts up: of course the most powerful mining organisations think it is a good idea to centralize the market because they will very likely be the 'emergent' winners of this game. But as much as I don't give a shit about who mines my transaction I _do_ want it to be mined on a free and global and granulated as possible market.

These 400k are an estimate out of the blue by whoever about whatever someone has. Every campaign though has a budget and every budget is finite. Furthermore the budget for this campaign is not 400k BTC I'm pretty sure.


What would be "fraudulent" about these clicks?


Had not thought about this indeed. On the other hand, one does buy a certain amount of clicks / eyeballs when booking a campaign and the ads will be visible as long as the booked amounts have not been reached. Now when people click on the ads to drain the budget I find that better than some newbies running into them. The stats will look the same afterwards.

Let me suggest to you to learn about Bitcoin a bit more!
You will find out that you don't actually need a bank like Coinbase to use it and that an entry on the Bitcoin blockchain gives a whole new meaning to the term "receipt".
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:09:21
That is neither plain nor simple.
We now have an entity "the miners" that was never intended to be in the original Bitcoin (all nodes were considered to be able to mine in the whitepaper and in the first one or two years of development) and that now seems to try to get the power to change the incentive mechanisms of Bitcoin altogether. Not that all miners are evil or something but obviously if you throw enough money on hashing equipment you can try to do that.
Bitcoin though has built in defense mechanisms against any such attempts even if they were not foreseeable in detail back when it was developed. 
So in case some people with a hell of a lot of money for hashing power want to take over and make the rules then they can do that and leave to anetwork following their rules. If they want to use that hashing power in order to "kill" (and that is the word used by proponents of the fork including GA) the "minority chain" (which is Bitcoin) then the most natural reaction of the Bitcoin network is to change PoW and get rid of them and carry on.
I will know which coin is then Bitcoin and which is not, plain and simple :).
Plain and simple is the suggestion to change POW in case

Why should there be "BU DNA" in Bitcoin?
And do you understand that BU is completely made of Bitcoin core "DNA" as BU is a copycat with some very unreasonable changes?
And do you understand that BU developers have already shown that they cannot deliver code of a quality that is needed to run something like Bitcoin?

This is nonsense because in every nation state you have to pay VAT no matter what currency you accept and in every nation state there is a law forcing you to accept the national currency.

According to the people who share your opinion Bitcoin died two years ago. 
The strength and performance of the network as of today is undeniable proof that you are wrong but that does not stop you from making your point whenever you can, in every thread, whatever its topic. 
I would wish for more moderation here on this forum so I don't run into that nonsense all the time and you can go back to your "Bitcoin is dead" subreddit and do more whining about "censorrrship".

The forked chain would implode very fast as the vast majority of nodes would reject the invalid blocks. Miners would flee the BTU-pools who mine rejected blocks. 
In case any exchange lists the BTU-coins you will have a very short time-window of opportunity to sell your forked coins for Bitcoin to the BTU-hardliners who have strong faith and deep pockets :). 
For Bitcoin it will probably create some hickups like a little longer blocktimes (for a short while) and a dip in the exchange rate due to public confusion and bad press (if anyone notices really).
Not long after that all will be back to normal for a while, maybe see the next real bubble and we can wait for the next attempted takeover. They come and blow over. They do get stronger over time but so does Bitcoin :).

Well forking Bitcoin is only a way to create something that is an alt the moment it forked.
Forked alts can more easily integrate improvements that have been made on Bitcoin than newly created alts (which usually do not share Bitcoin's codebase or transaction history). I think that is what the meme tries to express.

@_date: 2017-03-21 04:45:47


I understand you on this one and even agree.
But if there is an "us" amongst the miners then you can now go back to that "us" and question what "we" are doing and if "we" are not about to shoot "our" own feet.

The Bitcoin whitepaper does not mention any data centers.
I know you will throw one quote from Satoshi's bitcointalk.org account at me now but I can throw some back at you where he contradicts himself but I am really fed up with that game.
To not have to go down this road again now I ask you to allow me to want to stick to the Bitcoin whitepaper. It says "peer to peer" I believe eight times. If you want to continue this discussion please explain how centralized data centers that take care of validation and confirmation fit into a p2p network and have anything to do with Bitcoin.
If you cannot deliver that let me say "Thank you and good night!".

Scaling has been discussed literally for years here on r/bitcoin. Only when people started to promote uncompatible changes to Bitcoin which destroy its fundamentals they were told to discuss that somewhere else.

But nowhere have I suggested people should not get organized and cooperate. Bitcoin itself is a beautiful result of such decentralized cooperation.
We are talking about technological decentralization of an infrastructure and that is pretty clearly defined. Peer-to-peer is the highest ideal of decentralization we know of so please check the Bitcoin whitepaper for how often it mentions that term. 
Call me a zealot or whatever: I want a decentralized Bitcoin. Period.

See since I know you a bit and I know that you have a high level of knowledge about these topics I just cannot take that kind of answer from you seriously as not just trying to troll around.
You are saying that you cannot see an attempt to centralize the development of Bitcoin by taking it away from a totally decentralized and transparent group of 100+ of the best cryptographers alive and giving it into the hand of one individual (XT) or into the hand of a private organization demanding real life identities and having a president and all that (BTU).
What can I say?


But I do call these attempts of re-centralizing shit an attack on decentralization because I perceive them as such. 
How would you go about it if you had that perception?
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:00:36


I never would.

I am sorry to have to tell you that according to the SEC Bitcoin is not secure enough for professional investors. The SEC is the entity that tells professional investors what is safe to buy.
Since the SEC has a very high standard for what assets are secure I can tell you that Bitcoin will never reach that standard. Professional investors want to have the same kind of security they got with Bernie Maddoff's ponzi scheme and with credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations based on subprime mortgages and other stuff that is secure and safe to invest in according to the SEC.
Also professional investors are a bit upset with Bitcoin as they are neither mentioned in the Bitcoin whitepaper nor has Bitcoin ever really done anything for the global professional investors community. 
Bitcoin offers no bail outs and no bonuses and there is no money in Bitcoin for financial incentives for professional investors to push Bitcoin to their ~~victims~~ customers.
And as long as that does not change I will now and then feel free to write this kind of amateur-hour shit and if it ends up as a sticky there I don't mind either.

They were not expected to turn into a powerful force to follow their own economic interests in the Bitcoin eco system. In the early days every node was expected to be a miner and this had not changed by the time Satoshi left. 
Many people had forecasted that something might derail when mining turned into a specialized industry. So yes, maybe the time will come to bring things back on track in order to keep Bitcoin Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:43:25
It is a bug in the protocol that has been known for ages but has never been prioritized to fix as it can only confuse individual nodes for a little while but not actually be used to steal funds or anything like that. Like a joke you can play on someone without causing any harm:
Only when it comes to the implementation of lightning or other second layers now it turns out to be a big stone in the way as these upgrades depend on instant accurate information. 
Segwit is the best fix of this bug we have seen so far, so it would open the path to non-linear scaling and as a side effect it would right now even make more space for transactions on-chain.

It has done much better at merchant adoption than it was to expected in the year 2013 that you mention.
And then that is something that is not even being needed for Bitcoin to be the huge success it has been.
Nobody with a brain expected actual global mainstream adoption anytime soon if ever. If you look into the economics of free market money you will find out that that's not the priority of a functioning digital free market money anyway.
Whatever you expected: I use Bitcoin every day more often than fiat money nowadays and that goes far beyond what was to be expected in 2013.
So I don't understand how you are trying to paint Bitcoin a non-success here now. Kinda absurd really.

rbtc has been taken over by scammers who try to market their altcoin / copy of Bitcoin to unaware people. In order to do so it is important for them to keep insisting that Bitcoin is somehow not really Bitcoin but their respective altcoin indeed is the real Bitcoin.
There are several of these copies (like Bitcoin cash SV) competing. The people behind bcash (that's the altcoin being promoted in rbtc) are the most successful due to their squatting of, for example rbtc.
Just ask yourself why these people use the ticker symbol of Bitcoin ("BTC") instead of using a subreddit named after the coin they actually promote.
And yes, of course, people in rbtc will tell you all kinds of stories how this scam "historically came to be" and was never intended to mislead anyone.

I have been using Electrum fo many years without any issues. To me it is one of the most trustworthy pieces of software out there.
Nothing like you have been describing can ever happen if you use the usual precautions you are supposed to use when dealing with Bitcoin. Like making sure you have the right software installed from the right source with the right signature. Also after reinstalling your software try a small transaction first and see if everything goes right before sending lots of money. And of course double checking the address you are sending to.
The guys in the thread you are mentioning are clueless, don't even know what software version they had installed and admit that they are being stoned while writing this. :)
I fully trust Electrum. If you use it on an online / offline pair of computers there is literally no solution out there that is more secure.
Sorry for your loss, but you should find out what the real problem was here instead of blaming it on Electrum because if you don't find out you might make the same mistake again.

If he was really into Bitcoin he might have created a cold wallet. This would be a piece of paper with either cryptographic gibberish written on it or a list of 12 or 24 words that look like arbitrarily chosen.
Good luck!
*edit: in no case ever pass the private key (the information on that piece of paper) on to anyone else before having learnt what that is. Whoever has that key has control over that money.*

We accept Bitcoin at point of sale  - directly, not through bitpay or such - every single day. Something between two and fifty transactions a day.
We experience hardly any stuck transactions. If so they are usually not sent from an actual wallet but from coinbase accounts or other banks / webservices, which we discourage.

Title a tad misleading.
*edit: no, it's actually not*
At some point any Bitcoin transaction does of course have to hit the network and get broadcasted.
With the Gotenna though you don't have to have internet access yourself and can send the signed transaction off grid to the receiver who can then broadcast it themselves or maybe to a service who does that. So in combination with blockstream's satellite service which allows you to receive blocks without accessing the internet you can receive, validate and send Bitcoin transactions without an ISP.
I got myself a pair of Gotennas (playing around with them right now, hence the long post) and really hope they take off in my town so there will be enough around to cover the area with a mesh network. 
Cool stuff this.

It was absolutely polital.
Coinbase at the time did not batch transactions and used a worst practice system of unneccessary two onchain transactioins for every withdrawal and those transactions were much bigger than needed. Search for it and you will find details.
So at the same time they pushed a "solution" of bigger blocks they were actually jamming the network themselves.
You have to reflect the fact that Coinbase has a business model which makes their multi billion dollar corporation obolete in case Bitcoin gets adopted as the p2p system it was meant to be. Then you can answer for yourself if Coinbase wants Bitcoin to stay decentralized and permissionless.

Only because it's illegal. 


Only because it's illegal it has that value. That illegality does depend on the state's decree and therefore on a centralized organization. A scamcoin with fiat value so to speak.
3) Its easily divisible
Yeah we could all carry cool little digital scales with us and use them at the bar. I guess you had that in mind and then forgot about the durability aspect money should somehow have ...
4) Its transportable
Yeah. We could implement local trust centers that take people' cocaine and certify it on, lemme think ... something like the blockchain maybe and then it would be as transportable as Bitcoin.
5) It has high demand
I believe you overestimate that in relation to the world population. Absolute majority of peple would not have any use for it (could hit you with the regression theorem here but I won't).
6) Its difficult to counterfeit
Yeah, we can also bring cool little cocaine quality testing machines to the bar. Maybe we  could build those into the cool little digital scales even.

@_date: 2017-08-10 01:53:26
Wow there really is a troll brigade coming here now to spin the "Lightning will centralize Bitcoin" bullshit narrative.
But it won't:
Because everybody, literally everybody with some amount of Bitcoin can be one of these lightning nodes. Without asking for permission and without having a bank license. You can, I can, we can be our own bank and thats why it cannot be centralized. Because everybody can.
It is capable of routing transactions which means if Citi bank runs a node and they refuse to carry out your transaction well, my node is going to happily accept it. Thus no such thing as centralization is possible.
Plus if you do decide to become one of these nodes / hubs you have an actual chance of generating some small amounts of fees as an income. Probably very low because of high amount of competitors (which will keep the fees very low) but if you have deployed a channel that serves thousands or millions of transactions it might add up to something.
That would mean if you deploy your coins on the lightning network (which is absolutely risk free other than when you store it on exchanges) you would actually have something like a savings account giving you interest on Bitcoin in a world with negatve interest on USD and EUR and the like. Just think about this and what it means for Bitcoins competitiveness for a minute!
And just in case I would be entirely wrong with what I just said: with segwit we now get many more possibilities than just lightning. Want a side chain with 100mb blocks every two seconds and call it "Starbuck chain" so everybody can have their coffee payment confirmed six times in 12 seconds? Go roll it out! If anyone finds it useful they will use it.
On this side of the fork the threat of centralization is farther away then ever in the Bitcoin universe.

Coinbase could have taken half the load off the network by simply using best practice. No hard fork needed for that and especially not one that puts development in the hands of the one person of their choice. They were part of creating the problem, not a solution to anything. This is fact, out in te open for everybody to see.
Also you do not need a conspiracy to explain this. They are an intermediary in an industry heading towards disintermediation. Their CEO is obliged by law to protect the money of his investors and to make them more. Obviously that cannot happen if Bitcoin works p2p hence it is 100% logical for them to try to steer this ship into a direction where they as intermediaries have any future.

As this keeps getting quoted:
- are you aware of the fact that SN is clearly contradicting his own whitepaper here as the whitepaper keeps talking about a peer to peer network and by definition a client/server infrastructure is not peer to peer?
- are you aware of the fact that usenet is dead for this very reason? I mean I guess most people here do not even know what usenet was and the few who do only have distant memories about it. Yes you can still use it: through commercial service providers who control the content being delivered and who take a high fee. That is clearly not the vision from the whitepaper.

The bigger the blocks get the more resources I need to run a validating node. Whoever does not run his own validating node is forced to use a third party to tell him if a transaction has been taken place.
As soon as you have to use third parties (aka 'banks') your privacy and thus Bitcoin's fungability goes down the drain. 
What you are saying does not make any sense to me.
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:59:00
Seeing it from his perspective. He says it's in a bubble. So he recommends to buy 'high' (in his opinion) and to try to call the top and sell at the right time even though he must know that his readers will try to panic sell in a dip and lose money.
He wrote an utterly bad article against Bitcoin in july and then probably convinced a few people not to invest in Bitcoin thus not doubling their money in a couple of weeks.
If you wanna lose money fast the best thing you can do is to follow the advise of this guy.

Bullion is supposed to be fine gold 999 whereas Kruegerrands contain a small percentage of copper (and nickel I believe) which makes the coin harder and gives it its typical colour.

Then we have even more in common.
However, I think it's pretty obvious that an environment with plenty of possibilities for reliable and trustless off chain transactions offers much more possibilities to deploy privacy and fungability enhancing features than a single panopticum style ledger that stores everything forever. Especially when that single ledger goes up in size until it really can only be computed by centralized datacenters. 
Which again *does* connect the blocksize issue, the online / offline scaling debate on one side and privacy / fungability on the other.

Yet these are the reasons why it was built in the first place. Read the cryptoanarchist manifesto and the Bitcoin whitepaper and you will understand. 
If you get these properties confused with "criminal use" then you might also want to learn a bit more about the world alltogether. For example you will understand that the exact reason for the unbanked being unbanked is the lack of these properties in other financial and payment systems so if you take these properties away they will stay unbanked.

Time: Block  (Wednesday the 23rd, party starts 8pm)
The activation of segregated witness is a huge milestone in the development of Bitcoin. A step which enables a literal explosion of cool new features enhancing scalability, fungability, privacy and usability of our favourite money. 
We want to celebrate this moment in Bitcoin history at ROOM77, where we host the longest still running Bitcoin meetup worldwide and where a lot of early Bitcoin history has been written. So if you are as excited as we are come on over and celebrate with us. There will be lots of special treats on that special night like a trezor being auctioned off for charity, free beer sponsored by anonymous, little crypto-anarchist bibles and other stuff.

Germany was very early acknowledging Bitcoin as money but things have changed when the ministry of finance started understanding what it actually is. 
At the moment Germany is a dessert without a Bitcoin atm and without localbitcoins as the regulators harrass people but on the other hand do not make any clear statements in regards to what kind of licence one would need in order to do so. They kinda think they can wait it out but don't realise that they scare innovation away.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:47:10
Because it is yet another attempt to replace the actual Bitcoin and it is failing fast. 
As an altcoin it is entirely obsolete as it does not even fill some tiny niche. It is plainly pretty useless. It has very few and not very competent developers and is dropping the most important advancements of Bitcoin.
Last but not least it is the one man show from a very rich megalomaniac who wants to be the chief motherfucker in charge (pun intended).
So most people don't think it has a very bright future and try to dump it as long as it's still worth something which is not so easy as the goddammed thing does not even function properly.

@_date: 2016-11-25 18:42:54


I'm not trying to sell you anything, I'm trying to help you understand.
If you are asking like above "how many nodes we actually need" then you are asking the wrong question. Decentralization is not some abstract ideal that can be meassured by counting nodes or anything else. It is your individual empowerment to run a node as running a node provides exactly that empowerment to you. Therefor the only meassurement for it is the ease to run that node and that is easier the lower your individual CONOP (cost of node operation) is. And your CONOP is lower the lower the blocksize is as the smaller the blocksize is the fewer resources you need to spend on your node.
@_date: 2016-12-21 03:36:04
Money does not always and everywhere have to fulfill all three aspects of money that you have listed there.
Like Bitcoin is not anywhere right now a unit of account. But it could be in theory and it has the potential to become that some day and its qualities as a means of exchange and as a store of value (in its short life at least) are so superior that that does not matter. It's still money.
Gold outcompetes any and everything when it comes to a store of value as it was a reliable one for thousands of years, nothing else has done that. As a unit of accout it works better than Bitcoin but as a means of payment it is really bad these days.
It is still money. Greenspan even admitted (but that was leaked ;)) that it is "the premier money, no fiat money and not even the dollar can even compete with it."
@_date: 2016-12-20 18:55:34
Gold is not an investment for taking profits. It's rather like an insurance to be able to keep value and preserve buying power during otherwise turbulent economic times.
So your 100USD invested into the stock market in 1913 were basically wiped out 16 years later in the crash of 1929 while the 5 ounces of gold would still have their buying power today.

"Royal Mint and CME are yet to decide who will have access to the open blockchain ledger, ..."
This is a real innovation though. It's "open" yet it still needs permission by the mint. A public-private blockchain so to speak, openly closed.
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:45:11
No, that's not what I said.
I use an SPV wallet often but I am assured by the technology that whenever I desire I _can_ fire up my full node (for example where I keep my savings strictly under my own control or when I want to receive a payment and want to absolutely make sure that I received it without having to trust anyone else).
The magic lies in the sheer possibility to run a node, not in the fact that I run a node all the time. And that possibility is getting smaller the bigger the blocks are. For everyone on the planet, regardless of their resources. 
Think former east Germany where people could not travel and leave the country. They rebelled in the end not because they so desperately wanted to see the Eifeltower but because they wanted to live a life where they had the possibility to do so if they wished.
That's a difference.
@_date: 2016-12-12 21:05:54
No, because no person in their right mind would want to run a node of an altcoin that needs 100 times as much resources as Bitcoin. That coin would not offer any security as only very few people would run a node and decentralization would go down the drain.
You can pay your coffee in Bitcoin over a payment channel in the near future or just use Visa.

Any bitcoins become "smart BTC" as soon as they are being moved to Rootstock's sidechain, which is not deployed yet. They can be moved back at any time by the owner to be available on the dumb mainchain again, so the question if a bitcoin is "smart" or not just depends on where it is at any given moment.

Sorry for answering twice but I had this afterthought which deserves its own comment:
at the end of the day the biggest reward I can get out of running a full node is the personal super-empowerment it gives me. Being able to use this kind of independent money and transfer it anywhere at any time and keep it under my own total control is just so fucking magic and future that I personally do not give much about any monetary reward for doing so.
As long as this is possible for me I really don't care much how many nodes are out there, as long as there are a few. Only my own node gives me financial freedom.

You are in the wrong movie theater.
Nowhere at no time has anyone seriously stated that Bitcoin's goal is to achieve some kind of mass adoption. Bitcoin is the outcome of a long process trying to develop a censorship resistant and independent bearer asset. That was its goal from the beginning, that's what it is and that's what it's gonna stay.
If you cannot understand that or "take it seriously" then just go somewhere else. That easy.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:02:59
I don't have a clue what you are talking about. Fungability is seen by many members of the community as a much bigger issue to be solved than even the blocksize. 
What does 'moves the risks' even mean?
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:08:40
Because they are hodlers not daytraders.
Bitcoin comes from a totally different ideology than "let's trade something to make some profit". 
I don't 'hate' daytraders or TA but I do for sure miss the times when the members of this community discussed how to abolish banks all day instead of how to increase the numbers in their bank account.

Every banker, central banker, financial regulator and law enforcement officer I have met since I promote Bitcoin who has understood Bitcoin also owns Bitcoin.
They are not stupid.
That's the beauty of it: Bitcoin may be really threatening to some of these organisations but for the individuals inside these organisations it is super attractive once they understand it so they want to own some too.
Which means that the very people given the task to get Bitcoin under control usually have an incentive not to let that happen.

It is not about the amount of nodes out there.
It is about the potential, the possibility for everybody on the planet to run their own node if they so desire in order to be able to verify the truth for themselves without having to ask anyone. The only node that matters is your own.
Obviously any step that results in more resources needed for that is a step in the wrong direction. Ideally (albeit impossible) the blocksize would be zero or even negative.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:18:53
Same counts for bandwidth and importantly to cpu power as all these transactions need to be verified by a full node. 
The less transactions on chain the easier to run a full node and verify transactions instead of relying on someone else.

Please also do not underestimate the value that altcoins bring to Bitcoin as the ultimate testnets for stuff that can in the end be rolled out in Bitcoin. Ethereum for example tought us quite some very valuable lessons which we would not have made anytime soon on Bitcoin - even though it is weird that these testnet-tokens somethimes gain so much value despite the fact that nothing that can be done on a decetralized alt chain cannot in the end be done on Bitcoin.

Inversely, bigger blocks are obviouisly demanded by all the bitcoin BANKS, like coinbase, circle, xapo and blockchain.info. All the people who need you to use their service and do not want you to run your own node in order to satisfy the hundreds of millions of venture capital they were given want bigger blocks because bigger blocks make it harder for you to be your own bank.

I think this is key here.
As I said I wanna make a recommendation to people who really don't know much about how Bitcoin actually technically works but believe in it and wanna hold it for other reasons. For these people usability is key.
For the average Joe registering an email address on a website is already sorta too much hazzle so telling them to set up a hardware wallet is kinda over the top. Obviously a certain effort will always have to be made in order to secure a digital bearer asset but the less the better.

Bitcoin was first of all built to be p2p, to give everybody the possibility to fnd out the truth about a transaction without having to ask anyone else.
That is individual financial super empowerment. Nothing else can give you that and if that comes with a transaction fee then I do not care especially when that transaction fee is still cheaper than what the corporate slave banking system charges me.

"Bitcoin is a fad but the underlying tech has a lot of potential" is usually a narrative spun by bankers and governments.
That is by people who either do not understand the impact of Bitcoin or who have jobs that don't allow them to understand it.
All the hype about "blockchain without Bitcoin" is hot air and once we actually see other applications of the blockchain then these things will be rolled out on THE blockchain (of Bitcoin) anyways as this is the most secure and decentralized one by far.
I believe as much in a "blockchain without Bitcoin" as I believed in "online but not internet" 30 years ago.

Nope. Just checked with my lawyer who confirmes that I HAVE to accept EUR in Germany for the payment of anything owed to me by anyone at any time.
I would believe they have similar laws in the USA.
After all, if they would not enforce this with all their monopoly on violence people would just use the currency of their choice for every economic activity and only exchange that for the state fiat money once they need to pay their taxes.
And that would actually be the biblical situation described in the old testament when Jesus actually got violent and threw the money changers out of the temple of Jerusalem. The only situation in which he turned violent actually. People back then used a currency of their choice (silver based I believe) for day to day transactions and had to exchange that for the special money in which you had to pay your temple tax ('Shekel' I believe, fiat stuff). Money changers made a fortune of course.
However, I find it hard to believe that one can run an official business in the US without accepting their legal tender for payment.
If that is so though I applaud it.
These laws only refer to cash as in notes and coins as what you have to accept. They do not state that you have to accept the legal tender via credit cards or paypals or whatever. But notes and coins you always have to accept.

Good fucking riddance. Circle and Allaire have been massive proponents of regulation of Bitcoin from the very beginning when they turned up some three years ago. They have educated thousands of people in a way that these people accepted their intrusive KYC/AML requirements. They are proactively surveilling their customers beyond what banks are doing, thanks to the transparency of the blockchain.

A lot of money is being spent in order to keep up the campaign for big blocks. Someone is paying ads on this subreddit to promote the big block subreddit. Roger has also announced to pay miners some extra money (also called a bribe) if they join his pool and start mining BU. The most efficient way he can do that is by convincing people that it is actually neccessary and that can most efficiently be done by filling up the blocks.
Also, if I were a bank or whoever who wants to get Bitcoin as a competitor out of the way the most efficient way to achieve that would be by making it less efficient and more expensive to use and a spam attack would be the most reasonable means to that end.
These are at least two likely hypothesis.

This is exactly what i would love to see!
There is a little hope that LN would bring upon such a reward for node operation by generating fees. That would give you a savings account for bitcoins with interest paid (fees you collect) in a world with negative interest AND it would be a reason for running a Bitcoin full node to be able to do so.
Downside: the bitcoins on your lightning node are more vulnerable to getting hacked than in your offline ice cold wallet (not because of LN but because you expose them to the network) and we do not really know yet how much fees that will generate, maybe very very little.

Bitcoin transactions are irreversible once confirmed by the network. Therefor it is very unusual that your brother got the funds sent to his wallet.
I have never heard of a scam in which the victim gets sent the funds in Bitcoin first. The classic Bitcoin money mule scam works so that the victim gets money sent via bank accounts (from cracked credit cards or hacked online banking accounts) and is being asked to withdraw cash, buy Bitcoin for the cash and send the Bitcoin to the scammers. The bank transfer will be cancelled after a few days, the scammers have unconfiscatable Bitcoin and the victim has to pay the money back to the victims of the hack (and probably face legal consequences for taking part in the scam).
Are you sure your brother actually got the funds sent to his wallet already?
If so I guess it's his to keep.

You are right, what he is saying is correct.
But it is also still stupid to drag race (and gender) into the argument because the problem is not who is in control but the existence of such power to control in general.
The problems with central control cannot be solved by replacing the old white men in control with young black women or whatever this seems to suggest. It can only be solved by abolishing the position of control itself. Instead of replacing the king with a hopefully better king one needs to burn the throne once and for all.
Throwing race and gender into this argument totally distracts from the actual problem.
And that's a shame.

"Spam" and "attack" are actually the same thing when it comes to the Bitcoin network.
Spam in Bitcoin is not addressed to individual users like spam in email but to the whole network and it cannot really be distinguished from actual economic activity maybe with chaotic spikes due to bad practice or new business models with unusual behaviour or whatever.
But if it is actual spam addressing the network then that's rather an attack, something like a ddos attack on online systems.
However, yes, there can be a misuse of the blockchain in order to achieve certain goals. And whatever can be done is probably being done by someone.

The legal situation for Bitcoin ATMs in Germany is not clarified due to resistance from financial regulators.
Mr. Gorski is admitting that he sends his lawyers and the regulators after anyone who is deploying an ATM in Germany. He also slanders people who deploy ATMs personally claiming they were supporting illegal activities.

I believe that if you found the shares bought by your grandgrandpa hidden in the attic of the family house today you would not even recognize the names of the companies printed on most of these pieces of paper while you could just cash in on those five ounces of gold which have been untouched all the time and get roughly the same buying power your grandgrandpa spent back then to get them.

Bitcoin is an entirely new narrative, just like the internet itself. And just like the internet itself it is not possible to understand it in a few minutes. But also just like with the internet itself Bitcoin is rewarding the people who adopt it earlier than others.

I think it is a tad confusing for a Bitcoin hodler as what he does is merely keeping his buying power in the form of money he believes in. In Bitcoin's case this is called speculation while if someone has USD in their bank account nobody would call them Dollar speculators. 
So if you hold Bitcoin you're a speculator and when you hold USD you are a saver.
And that's confusing.

The thing that gives Bitcoin value in the first place is that you can hold, send and receive it yourself without using any intermediary, any service or bank. 
Just get yourself a Bitcoin wallet. Learn how to use it by sending a small amount there first and successfully making a backup and then you can enjoy being the only person that has any control over your money other than trustng a bank like coinbase with it.

Negative interest rates do not create negative inflation. 
Interest rates and monetary inflation are independent stories. While negative interst rates could in theory lead to deflation of consumer product prices they do not influence the amount of currency units in circulation ("deflation").

I don't share that opinion.
rbitcoin was a very useful sub until rbtc was created and filled with sockpuppet accounts. Of course those spill over here but the other sub was really just created to bash this one, to promote altcoins and to declare Bitcoin a failure and their developers devils.
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:06:31
Well the beauty and innovation of Bitcoin is that you do not need an intermediary to hodl, send or receive it. You can use the wallet of your choice tat allows you to hold your own private keys.
What you have is an IOU from a bank that the bank may or may not value in the future. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-02-10 16:36:49


Well then here lies the misunderstanding.
Because that is exactly what Bitcoin is not: regulated.
This may mean that it is not (yet) as convenient to use as we all would wish but it has some significant advantages on the other hand that could not be realized any other way. 
If you take a closer look down that rabbit hole you will understand and I am sure you will not mind investing some time in order to understand it better and learn how to use it more efficiently. 
Achieving financial souvereignty is worth that.

You have just made clear that it is you who does not understand "how the Bitcoin protocol is designed to work". I did never ever sign up for a system in which "the miners" decide what's going on and that was not its intention. Never.
But if this honestly is your interpretation of the ideology that lead to the emergence of Bitcoin then it probably makes sense for you to support a governance coup that will inevitably lead to a few mining corporations in even fewer jurisdictions. Then we have less "miners" that we need to rely on.

There's no mining here but you can at anytime open up a lightning hub of whatever size yourself. You can be your own bank.

Calling out scammers like Roger and Jihan is not witchhunting but calling out scammers.
Calling calling out scammers withchunting is directly supporting the scammers by portraying the scammers as victims.
Since you support scammers who pay people to support them (they openly run a paid-retweet campaign for example) and since there is no other reason to support scammers than to get paid for it I have to assume that you are getting paid for supporting the scammers.
Also it is "blatantly" true that witchhunting is being banned here but calling out scammers is not.

There is no freaking model because there are no exact numbers. 
There is no defined point at which Bitcoin stops being censorship resisant but there is an understanding for the fact that the higher the costs of node operation the more likely we lose this important property of Bitcoin.
Also there is an understanding that a hell of a lot ccan be done to use the blockspace much more efficiently.
The smaller the blocksize the better. I have literally argued for a negative blocksize before.

You can cost average your purchase ( to spread the risk of buying too high. But in case Bitcoin only goes up during that time you would have been better off just buying in.

Please tell me how much a beer is at your bar and post a Bitcoin address. I would like to buy some for your guests.
**ALSO:** you now have the chance to get one hell of media attention if you communicate the fact that you accept Bitcoin now. I speak from my experience: I run ROOM77, the world's first real-world business that has accepted Bitcoin back in 2010 and we were featured all over the planet. With the situation in Greece right now you have a good chance to get global media attention.
**AND:** we have a tradition called "Sospenso" at ROOM77. That means someone who has money and is having a good time can pay a drink for someone who doesn't have money or a bad day without knowing who the receiver is (barman decides, you donate anonymously and you receive anonymously).

You can use one of multiple copies of Bitcoin out there that uses larger blocks, you can choose from a whole variety really. None of these have any success worth mentioning whatsoever by any metric. That is for reasons.
You can also just fork your own altcoin and have blocksizes tailored to your own desire.

But just like every piece of electronics, especially when carried and passed around, it will some day break, which means you always have the risk that it is you in who's possession it will break and not everyone is fine with having to do some desoldering and stuff then.

I don't care about mass adoption.
What matters is that Bitcoin exists as a tool for individuals to achieve self empowerment and financial sovereignty. I want this as much as many other people around here and we want this (and got this) regardless of the masses adopting it or not. The masses don't care about silly ideas like freedom and souvereignty, they care about consumer products and the competition between Donald and Hillary. If the masses would give a fuck then literally all governments and top bankers would be in jail and people like Snowden and Assange would be free.
I tell you one thing: only and only if Bitcoin stays as decentralized and as permissionless as it is now does it have a future at all. And if it has this future the masses will inevitably adopt it because of the economic incentive they will feel when their fiat goes south and Bitcoin stays strong and keeps on working the way it does. 
If you now let Bitcoin weaken by the influence of banks like coinbase and turn it into a permissioned platform run by some banks or corporations you will never see mass adoption because Bitcoin would not have any value to anyone and nobody would have a reason to own or use it.
So it is actually the other way around and Coinbasebank is the last thing Bitcoin needs.

This is wrong.
The more resources I need to run a full node the less decentralised the network is. The sheer amount of nodes out there is entirely irrelevant as only my own node counts when I want to find out the truth myself instead of having to ask anyone.
Increasing the blocksize in itself is the act of moving further into centralisation.

The blocksize increase itself does not but BU and the "emergent consensus" would put the control over the blocksize and thus over the transaction fees into the hands of the miners.

What banks do to promote Bitcoin:
- negative interest
- bank bail ins
- inflation of the monetary base
Governments drive people to Bitcoin through:
- monetary oppression against individuals, whole industries and nations
- capital controls
- the surveillance state
Bitcoin though attracts people through permissionless usage and innovation, borderlessnes and a certain degree of privacy.
Pretty clear case for every person with some understanding about the world around them and with a desire for at least a kind of liberty. Those move first.
All others will be forced by the banks and the governments and by realising that the people using Bitcoin just have huge advantages and don't loose their money. These people only move when they get burned in the old system.

Nope. It is not about from what size on it becomes a problem for whom.
The ideal of the p2p network of Bitcoin would be that everybody on the planet can at anytime and without any expenses know the truth (run a full node). This is obviously not possible.
However, the resources needed to transmit and process 2mb are twice as much as the ones needed to do so with 1mb. That is allways, everywhere and under all circumstances the case, wherever moore's law and technological process are taking us.
Two will allways be twice as much as one and therefor move the truth twice as far away from the ideal of zero.

That is nonsense. Bitcoin is not a game but real money.
And it is free money, free from government control and free from banks. In order to stay so it needs to to allow me to run a node with as little as possible resources needed.
Obviously only bankers and control freaks want to change that by pumping up blocks. I wonder how long it will still take before you guys understand that you are not succeeding.

Pls see my comment above (or wherever it's moving).
The amount of nodes running is totally irrelevant. Making it harder for me to run a node by increasing the resources needed for that is what moves us towards centralisation as more people will not be able to find out the truth for themselves and instead have to ask someone else (use SPV).

This cannot be upvoted enough.
**"The world needs truthtellers. They need Courage."**
If we want to build a new financial system based on trustless cryptographic technology we need whistleblowers to show us how gubments are illegally undermining and penetrating the technology we build on in order to stop us. 
Due to the astonishing fact that our societies are not stopping our "leaders" from breaking their own laws - not to mention punish them for it - whistleblowers and organisations like wikileaks are the last line of defense from corrupt and power hungry governments to build a better future for a free human kind. 
I personally hope we will soon see more leaks from the financial industry to show the public what is going on inside the central banks and the affiliated organisations. Wikileaks has already shown us how gold derivatives were discussed by these entities as a tool to manipulate the gold price before they were introduced to the market.
For these reasons I strongly support the courage foundation. I cannot imagine a better cause to contribute to in our present time.

To be honest this is the one topic in his book that actually gets him carried away and argue his personal taste rather than taking a neutral and reasonable point of view.
No doubt there is a lot of shit music around today but also no doubt that there are true artists and masters in modern times too and no doubt shitty musicians did exist already in the middle ages as well. And one can clearly argue that for example John Lennon's work had a much bigger (positive) impact on society than Beethoven's.
Art needs to be seen in the context of its time. There is no point in comparing Michelangelo to Banksy and there is no point in calling either of them a shitty artist because one does not understand their art. And if one would compare them one would have to admit that Michelangelo was a master of his craft who was expressing the ideas of the rich people who paid him while Banksy is also a master of his craft but expresses himself. 
That said I would always (and I do) reccomend his book.

Look, maybe I don't get the details and there will probably be very nasty details in a land reform in in SA.
But what I do get is that land reform is neccessary in a country in which most if not all of the land is being owned by people who have obviously taken it away by force, murder, genocide and slavery from the people who owned it before. Even if it was the grandparents or grandgrandparents of the people who own it today.
SOME kind of restitution will have to take place and if the people owning the land that was robbed from others only a few generations ago do not want to give some up it will be taken away from them and given back to the rightful owners.
Karma is a bitch. Blame your ancestors for having passed on to you what did not belong to them.
Your German / French comparison is completely inadequate here. If you want to argue wit Germans or French we need to talk about stuff that was taken away from Jewish Germans / French by the Nazi Government and then "sold" to Germans. After the collapse of the Nazi regime that stuff had to be given back at least to the Jews who had survived the genozide. Rightfully so. Even though some people were screaming "but we bought it!".
If I steal your bicycle and sell it to someone and you catch that someone with your bike and have evidence that this was your bicycle before I stole it are you gonna get it back in court or not? 
You people down there need to sit together and talk about how to give back what has been robbed without harming the people who own it today too much. Of course the fact that the land some guy nowadays runs an honest business on was robbed from others a few generations ago does not make that guy a bad guy. But the fact still remains and that guy also needs to understand that his wealth has been built on hardly forgivable violence and theft. 
You guys need to sit together and discuss solutions for the fuckup you are sitting in. Solutions both sides can live with. This is called a compromise.
Instead OP is going online r/bitcoin and praying that the exchange rate will save him from the atrocities of his ancestors.

I would not trust this company with a single Satoshi or support them by buying their products whatsoever.
I don't even know why they are advertising in the Bitcoin sub as they are proudly spreading FUD about Bitcoin in favour of pumping the Asicboost altcoin in other subreddits:
""Full Nodes" aka relay nodes or non mining nodes do not factor into the decentralization of the network!"
They actually encourage people to trust, not to verify. They openly support the takeover attempt of the mining cartel and call actual Bitcoin "unethical". They support centralization of Bitcoin by telling people they don't need a validating node.
I don't know if these people are doing this because they are incompetent or because they are evil, but then I also don't care as long as they attack Bitcoin the way they do.

The whole "Bitcoin cash" thing is very unprofessional, that's why there is not even a consistent ticker symbol. They chose "BCC" as a symbol without checking first if that is already in use (which it is, by "Bitconnect") and then had to switch to "BCH".
However, it means free money for you as you have the same balance of Bitmaincoin (aka "Bcash", "Bitcoin cash", "AsicBoostCoin", "ABC" ....) on that chain after the split as Bitcoin and you can still sell that balance for real Bitcoin as long as there are people willing to buy it (like misled noobs or the people pumping the altcoin).

May I ask what your answer has got to do with OP's question?
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:59:47
1. Create your own wallet (like electrum) with a secure setup (if we are talking a lot of money you may want to use an actual offline machine to generate your keys) or buy a hardware wallet.
2. Backup this wallet BEFORE you send any money to it. 
3. Send a small amount to that wallet first to see if everything goes smooth and then transfer all money you hold on exchanges to that wallet.
There are plenty of tutorials out there about that. You will need to invest a little time and effort to learn how it works. Your reward is complete financial sovereignty, which is the whole point of Bitcoin.
Sorry I cannot give you any Coinbase specific advise as I do not use it or any other banks. ;)

Ask people what kind of money they hold themselves and then explain to them that to gamble / bet / speculate on the USD or the EUR is much riskier than Bitcoin.
After all: all fiat currencies of the last 2.000 or so years failed and turned to dust. Without a single exception.
The only decentralized money we have so far, namely gold, has kept its buying power over all that time. Still people who hold fiat ("gambling on it") somehow think they are being reasonable. But they're not.

Of course the users and the developers of Bitcoin ("The core"?) would like every copycat of Bitcoin to use another name for their altcoin so not to confuse new users and make them loose their money.
Imagine me making some shitty phone and calling it "iPhone plus". Now that is not possible in the legacy economic world due to trademarks and copyrights and patents and all this. In the open source world though nobody owns the name "Bitcoin" and therefor you now have a bunch of corporations who are trying to sell you their shitty product by calling it "Bitcoin whatever".

Whatever you guess that I believe:
Financial self empowerment comes from being able to find out the truth about transactions yourself without having to ask anyone else if you have been paid. And yes, you need to run a node for that.
The whole "who needs to validate anyway" narrative is turning Bitcoin upside down. You either validate yourself or you use a bank like coinbase. Coincidentally all the banks are spinning the same narrative that you do.
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:59:31


Well nobody has made that statement. So whatever.


Again: it is the only way to validate your transactions yourself. If it is necessary or desirable for you to do so then there is simply no way around your own node.

Bitcoin is not even in the early adoption phase yet so you are what's being called an innovator.

The thing that gives value to Bitcoin in the first place is the fact that it is a digital bearer asset. Meaning you can store and transact it without using a bank like coinbase.

Your concerns are absolutely valid.
I do support Bitwala though because they are Bitcoin OGs who went out to create a bank that makes life easier for Bitcoiners rather than bankers who became Bitcoiners for marketing reasons.
The founders of Bitwala breathe Bitcoin since the early days and they share the ideals of this community like you or I do. They proved that by always being on the side of the users and implementing segwit and whatnot faster than anyone else and they supported the NO2X and the UASF movements, other than Coinbase, Bitpay and the other banksters. Plus they don't hold the keys to your Bitcoin.
So if you wanna have a bank for Bitcoiners integrating Bitcoin Bitwala is state of the art really. As a bank though they have to stick to the rules of the banking world and if you use a bank you are subject to these rules too.
I recommend to not have any money sitting around in bank accounts anywhere and to only use the banking system (and the fiat side of Bitwala) for transactions you cannot make in Bitcoin.

I would be very careful with any information coming from this site.
Despite their name they are not only pushing scammy altcoins but literally claiming those altcoins would be Bitcoin.
Furthermore the owner of the site has a history with claiming people's money was secure in MtGox a few weeks before it went down and everybody who trusted that statement had lost their money.
So if they now tell you that there is some super secure new storage whatever then that is most likely another scam trying to get your coins.

When you accept Bitcoin for products or services (I do so myself) then it is about the same thing as if you would buy Bitcoin. 
If you'd buy Bitcoin for fiat now would you be fine with paying 1k USD just because the exchange rate has the potential to go there?
Someone buying your for Bitcoin is basically selling his bitcoins. Why on earth would they sell for less than market price? Because the price has the potential to go down so they may as well take that hypothetical future loss already today?

A miner invests money (for hardware and electricity) in order to get something (Bitcoin) that they can only sell a while after having made that investment.
During that time the price of Bitcoin may go down (as it just did) and render that investment worthless (that's what you are talking about).
Any miners with a brain will hedge that investment ( by going short on Bitcoin ( which means they spend a little of their money on betting against the Bitcoin exchange rate. There are many ways to do that nowadays like futures and other stuff.
This means that if they lose money on the exchange rate they can compensate that loss by winning their bet. If the exchange rate does not go down they have lost their bet but still made money on the price they get for the Bitcoin they mined and the loss they made by shorting Bitcoin can be considered as an expense for an insurance against price decrease.
Any miner who is not short Bitcoin when mining is, well, a bit careless or maybe brainless so I guess the majority of miners is hedged against the current decrease in exchange rate.

I think your page should contain the information that some of the clients you are featuring there will make it two times or eight times or however many times harder and costlier to do what you are asking people for (to run a node).
Also questioning your proposition. Running a node is not something I do because I want to keep the network healthy, it is something I do because I have the ultimate financial truth machine and a monetary instrument that penetrates every former limit at my very own disposal and that is an awesome empowerment in today's world.
That's worth mentioning if you want to convince people to run a node.
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:38:24
Are you actually saying I am making this up?
@_date: 2016-10-06 02:00:34
Thanks for answering, but the article you link to does not convince at all. First of all the author is really nitpicking. A statement like “The modern banking system creates currency far faster than trees can grow” for example is an absolutely valid description of the reality. Of course one can go more into detail (how the treasury is involved and so on) but that does not change that reality whatsoever as it IS the banking system producing all that money.
On his other points the author's argument is as week and especially when he criticizes the quote “[deficit spending] Steals prosperity out of the future so it can spend it today” he entirely fails to understand that a) this is of course the case when future generations have to pay back today's debts (which is why fiat systems all fail as from a certain height of debt that becomes impossible) and b) that the fact that the USD is the world reserve currency modelled after Hjalmar Schacht is indeed the one big reason for the prosperity of the US. 
But after all, the author trying to "debunk" the video at the end of his article admits that he stopped watching the video after five minutes so I am not surprised he does not quite understand what he is writing about. Also, people who accuse others of "conspiracy theories" usually do not really have factual arguments they can deliver.
So Maloney here clearly wins the argument. The fact that he is dealing gold can also not be brought up at his disadvantage as he is just doing what he believes in. Btw the same argument is being brought forward against Bitcoin when they are being sold for fiat currency: "If Bitcoin was better than USD the owners of Bitcoin would not sell them for USD", which is pure rhethorical BS.


Take a silver reserve one dollar note from decades ago and an ounce of silver and compare their buying power or take a German 100 Mark note from the times they were redeemable in gold and compare the buying power (would be 50 EUR now if still exchangable) to the approx 40 grams of gold they were redeemable for and then rethink your statement here.

I don't understand how you can say that. I gave you the examples before in regards to silver dollars and fiat notes, you just have to look at the charts to see has obviously risen in fiat terms for a long time. So what do you mean?


Disagree. It is government entitled entities without stockpiles who can therefor manipulate the price ;). You're right though, that doesn't change the fact it's price is manipulated these days.
Agree on your other points in regards to gold. Still strongly of the opinion that gold is a much better store of value than fiat.

Well sort of. But what I mean is that the fact that you achieve personal financial super empowerment by running a node is a much more convincing proposition than telling people "be nice and help the network!". Also the amount of nodes is not really that important for the network itself, the important thing is that we build an infrastructure that is not depending on third parties.

See them as testing laboratories where people can experiment with functions that can all be incorporated into Bitcoin but should not be implemented quickly and without properly understanding them. Ethereum's DAO is a good example: we want extended scripting possibilities in Bitcoin but not before we can shield Bitcoin's blockchain from the risks that come with that by implementing them on a sidechain. Meanwhile we can learn important lessons on the alt-chains and everything that works there and makes sense will finally consolidate on the Bitcoin network (where almost everything out there has originated anyways).
The fact that many people also use these experiments for speculation and sometimes invest absurd amounts of money in them is staggering but that's their decision. Also, when people are invested in them they see the original protocol as an economic competitor, hence the hostility we see a lot. But that's a small price to pay for the advantage of having these testing grounds in the first place.

Thousands of small suppliers working from their home growing weed and mushrooms, producing high quality chemical stuff and competing against each other via service, price and quality versus huge brutal cartels fighting with machine guns for monopolies in certain areas. What exactly do you not understand?


Having to go into some dark corner of a park at night to trade with a pusher that you cannot distinguish from a robber versus safely making orders online. What exactly do you not understand?
There is quite a lot of research being done on this topic these days which you could find if you wanted to. For example:
I have been talking about this topic to high up law enforcement and other government people. Nobody disputes the fact that online trading significantly reduces violent crime. In the SR documentary you can see and hear cops clearly stating that it would be a wonderful thing if the drug business would be taken off the streets onto online markets for exactly this reason.


You do not explain anything here but you do come across as quite arrogant.

On online markets you have thousands of smaller producers and vendors who cannot harm each other nor be violent towards the buyers whereas in real life you have cartels fighting each other over their districts and market shares. In real life the decisive factor for market share is violence, not customer satisfaction. Alone Mexican drug cartels kill literally thousands of people every year and fight actual wars. 
Nobody gets killed online.
The fact that online drug trading massively reduces violence in the drug business is not being disputed by most law enforcement I talked to about this (which I have).

Not sure why you think the users went to the police and reported this as the article does not state that in any way.
I guess LE and private spy companies are doing a lot of analyzing of all data they can gather from the blockchain and and about addresses related to the DNM economy that they can find out about that kind of huge scam without anyone reporting they have been hacked.
Would be interesting now to see if people can get their money back and how they would go about that.
IMHO it clearly is the responsibility of LE and government to send all the stolen money they recovered back to the corresponding addresses :).

That is the combined computing power of all miners mining on the Bitcoin network.
An increase of the hash power does not mean there is more space for more transactions, but that the same amount of transactions is secured by more computing power.
@_date: 2016-05-29 16:13:46
Whoever owns / ends up owning the RTC on the sidechain can get the Bitcoin back that were locked on the Bitcoin main blockchain to create the RTC.
So if a miner gets fees in RTC they actually own Bitcoin as soon as they unlock them again on the mainchain.

See here we totally disagree on a basic issue. Honestly, the fact that the first world is the first world has primaily to do with the application of violence against the rest of the world. Being on top of the food-chain by issuing a central world reserve currency helps a lot too.


Well, as he points out and to my own knowledge that "desaster" has hit every single fiat debt system in history and in all of these cases gold was exactly that hedge.

I have on purpose chosen a chart from a site that does exactly NOT sell gold or silver. You still claim so two or three times in your response which surprises me as on the other hand you accuse me of not vetting the sources here.
However, looking at the inflation-adjusted charts you provide I can see the following:
If i spent 10 USD on an ounce of silver in 1915 I now have 17.50 USD in buying power. If I spent 200 USD on an ounce of gold back then I have 1.250 USD to buy stuff now. That not only qualifies as "having kept its buying power" for me it is even a clear and undisputable increase of that buying power, nevermind the volatility in between.
But the actual point here:
Why in the world would I even _look_ at _inflation adjusted_ charts here? My argument is that "fiat is a worse store of value because of inflation" and you answer with "not if we take inflation out of the equation!" (and then you are still wrong as your own examples clearly show). Huh!?
Inflation is reality and because of that reality a federal reserve one USD note from 1915 buys me stuff for 0,89 EUR now while the corresponding silver coin buys me stuff for 16 EUR. Today, in this world, not in some theory in which one negates the reason for this depreciation of the fiat dollar. 
How is that a "conspiracy theory"? Who here is "divorced from reality"? 
And about the gold standard having kept the buying power stable for the 150 years prior the the founding of the fed:


No, from here:
This shows that under the gold standard 6 generations (25 yrs each) altogether only suffered the same inflation as we now under the central bank fiat regime suffer in a couple of years.
And no, that site doesn't sell gold either, doesn't even have gold as a topic whatsoever.
Jaises Christ, how is claiming that 0.89 EUR is less than 16,00 EUR IN THE REAL WORLD a "non factual statement". I mean you claim "a solid understanding of math" but in what universe does this kind of math apply? 
Do they have shops there where you can buy food at "inflation adjusted" prices?
Do you have green skies there and blue lawns?

Whereas the counterfeiting happens through marketing campaigns and while every Bitcoin client will tell you what is a Bitcoin and what is not a Bitcoin the scammers are marketing wallets that tell their users that some forked coins were actually Bitcoin now.

You are telling me that the fact that a silver coin has kept its buying power while the same nomination paper currency has vastly depreciated is completely irrelevant in a discussion of what is a better store of value. This is where a discussion necessarily has to come to an end because this to me sounds like utter nonsense. You are telling me that the grass is blue and the sky is green and I fail to believe you even though you use a lot of words to convince me.
I can see your point about the predictability of the depriciation of fiat and the volatility of preciuos metals but a) I don't care that my asset depreciates predictably, I don't want it to depreciate and that is the topic here, b) every single fiat currency in the history of mankind has at some point become entirely unpredictably and went down the drain and c) whenever preciuos metals go down somewhat you can with historical certainty predict they will soon go back up again because they did since the times of the old Romans, when they had approximately the same buying power as they do today.
Also,  delivers back a 503 error message from every device I try to access it. But nevermind, one can take other sources for the historical value of gold in fiat terms like:
If I check your 1980 example i can see that if I bought an ounce of gold in January 1980 I spent 668 USD and could now sell it for 1.256 USD _despite_ the fact that it was at an exceptionally high spike in 1980 and has now gone through a long correction period which means _despite_ the fact that I bought really really expensive and would now sell really really cheap.
But you are telling me that 1.258 USD is far less than 668. If I took your 1934 example it would be much more extreme because gold was around 20 or 30 bucks an ounce back then.


The US unilaterally abandoned the gold standard in 1971 not because it did not work but because they had printed so much paper money to finance their attack wars in Indochina (Korea, Vietnam) that they had to default on their promise to deliver gold for their dollars made in Bretton Woods, which was precisely what Keynes had predicted after Bretton Woods. 
During the 150 years prior to the founding of the Fed in 1913 the precious metals backed, non-inflatable USD had kept its purchasing power a hundred percent (!). 
But you are telling me that 150 years of keeping the buying power of every saver in an economy which had an unprecedented time of economic growth and progress during this period did not work somehow.


Maybe this is the problem really. As I said before, you only get a degree from a university if you prove to believe the stuff that is being taught there. And that stuff nowadays is necessarily a religious belief in central banks and the fiat system. This is not to offend you, but my only explanation for why you say things that to me sound like the story of the blue grass and the green sky.

A miner invests resources (hardware and electricity) in order to make Bitcoin, which is a highly volatile asset.
If the miner has any brains they will hedge ( this investment against a price decrease which they can do by shorting ( Bitcoin.
That's what futures are for.
edit: So if the price of Bitcoin goes down the miner will compensate that loss with the gains from their short position. In case the price does not go down they have spent some expenses on an insurance against the price going down. Should be normal business practice for any miner with a brain.
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:44:49
So if I understand you correctly you have made some great profits by just hodling Bitcoin but you now would like to increase these profits by doing what is called "timing the market".
1. Don't do it. You will fail unless you are as lucky as a lottery winner.
2. If you want to play that lottery only throw in a small amount of your coins first, test the waters. You will most likely burn that amount and just keep hodling the rest.
3. Don't use that token you mentioned as a hedge, rather choose something somehow more real like allocated gold on vaultoro or something similar.
4. Don't ask people on the internet for investment advise. Therefor don't believe a word I said either!
Good luck!

They function perfectly and not only does their service make my life as an all-in-Bitcoiner much easier it is also of great help to get merchants to accept Bitcoin directly when these merchants have an easy way to spend their bitcoins to pay their bills that they could otherwise not pay in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:28:19
Please do! 
I entirely support 's advise.
I would probably go one third Bitcoin and one third gold but this is up to your preferences. Gold (and silver!) will more or less keep its buying power for the rest of your lifetime while Bitcoin gives you the possibility of incredible gains (as well as losses). In both cases make sure you actually hold the asset yourself (like physical gold/silver well hidden away on your land and Bitcoins in your own wallet).
Most important is his point  though! :)

@_date: 2016-10-07 23:17:14
Indeed I do not understand what you are saying :).
Also, your links don't work, but nevermind, I can find historical gold charts elsewhere. All they show me that gold has always risen in terms of fiat currency and that, despite volatility at times, whoever kept precious metals over the time did still have buying power while fiat currency have always and everywhere depreciated, however "predictibly". 


Fact is that an old silver Yen nowadays has a buying power of 16 EUR while one in a bank allows you to go shopping fo 0.8 EUR cents. That a Silver dollar now has a buying power of the same 16 EUR but the paper note buys me stuff worth 0.89 EUR. That the 100 Mark note I inherited from my grandpa would have a buying power of 50 EUR now (if it could have been carried through the four currency reforms we had in Germany since then which mostly wiped out all bank savings completely anyway) but if he would have kept the gold coins it was redeemable for that would now be worth about 1.500 EUR.
This is the same everywhere and for everybody and I really don't have a clue how you can say fiat currency was "a great store of value in modern history". 
So let's agree that I do not understand what you are talking about :).

But believe me it will shake out.

And as you have pointed out it cannot even do anything that Bitcoin could not do either. I believe to claim so was the actual scam.

One has to be either very ignorant or clueless in this field to have to ask for Jon's expertise. He's only been around the cryptocurrency space since the early nineties and you will hardly find anyone who understands the economics better than him. I guess that's why he is one of the few people who were mailed by Satoshi about his whitepaper back in the days.
You will fail utterly answering the question why he might have been bad for Bitcoin.

If there is any justified pretext to revoke someone's privileges then it is when that someone declares to give those privileges Satoshi and then says Satoshi is someone who the whole community believes is a con artist who should please never ever get those privileges.

There is, however, bad practice, which is indistinguishable from spam. 
I guess I will be beaten for this now but that is why I actually find an increase in transaction fees atm not the worst thing in order to put some pressure on companies like coinbase to optimize their code and their procedures to not flood the blocks with more transactions than needed only because it's free.
I do run several full nodes and unneccessary transaction volume *does feel* like spam to me.

That was our ATM in Berlin (at ROOM77) and yes, it's gone, we only had it for two months due to lack of banking license.
The Bundesbank investigated against us but dropped the investigation because they accepted that it was only temporary (two months), uncommercial (no fees taken) and basically for R&amp;D and demonstration / education purposes.
We could not really find out which licenses would be required actually though. I believe the regulators here don't know themselves. For example the question was raised if Bitcoin is a financial investment so running an ATM might require a financial investment brokerage license and so on.
Germany has really changed from being very early in defining Bitcoin as private money and being cheered as a Bitcoin and innovation friendly jurisdiction to the opposite.

In the old physical world, the government took your money to provide you with infrastructure (roads, bridges, ...) and maintain that infrastructure in such a way that everbody can use it and be safe doing so. If a bridge starts crumbling the government would see that, block the bridge, warn everybody to get near it, fix it and let you use it again when it is safe to do so again.
In the new digital world, the safety of your infrastructure (your computer, mobile, the internet, ...) is completely in your own responsibility and its reliability is up to the level of your knowledge or the knowledge of your friends who you trust. The biggest threat to your safety now is your government, which is spending astronomical amounts of your money on making your infrastructure vulnerable to their own as well as everybody else's attacks. It now uses your money to make your life more insecure and risky.
It doesn't even matter if you have lots of money so you can pay an expert company to take care of your security because the government will always have more money to bribe them or just use their big stick to force them to work on their behalf.
This is your tax money at work now.

Bitcoin is not a currency "for the masses" in the first place.
"The masses" don't care about freedom from monetary oppression, about inflation, negative interest rates and so on. They accept these things happening to them because they believe their governments are doing the best they can for them.
"The masses" don't even care about the illegal surveillance state imposed upon them.

Well this shows what a nonsense all this middlemen-bullshit is.
Bitcoin is intended to be sent from the buyer to the seller.
Now all kinds of middlemen are again being implemented. In this case the payment goes from buyer to middleman  to middleman  and then to the seller.
And that nonsense is all over the place. I just refused a consulting job for a payment service provider who wants to accept Bitcoin through a Bitcoin payment provider, which would have been the same stupid setup, for that very reason. 
There is no point in talking people into using Bitcoin through banks before they have understood the innovation of it and develop the desire to take advantage of it themselves. Even if that means it will take longer for the technology to spread.

Well, my own store has been doing so for over four years now and I know there are others.
I am aware of the fact that probably most stores use Bitpay and stuff and convert right into fiat. But I don't think that's a reason for people to store their bitcoin in banks and und use these banks to make payments.
And then there is where people talk about USD and there is where people talk about banks. Maybe we should make the same distinction to get rid of all the noise here about centralised services which are not needed to use Bitcoin.
And after all, people will eventually move back here from the bitcoinbanks-subreddit whenever they start understanding Bitcoin.

2. Give the seed (or private key) to them and the public key so they can watch their Bitcoin on a bliock explorer.
3. Explain utter importance of seed (or private key).
4. KEEP a copy of the seed / private key because there is a huge probability they will lose just that and so you can recover it for them when they come to you a few years later because their Bitcoin is gone.
This is my standard procedure after having given away Bitcoins already years ago and making the experience that most of the people who got some have lost them. :(

Waiting for confirmations in that kind of transaction scenario (like paying for the infamous coffee) does not make sense. This is working fine now that basically all the people who pay in Bitoin (we receive Bitcoin payments every day) are people who are into the tech and into the currency and support it and don't want to mess around but in a mainstream scenario that would be different. So this needs to be changed before Bitcoin can go anywhere mainstream thus getting lightning network/s up and running will be a big step towards that.
Also our customers always get a round of "something" or two or three no matter how long it takes to find the next block or even what blocksize they're into. ;)

Well yes, exactly what I was trying to say. The charity may choose to use one address inly so people can see how much money was actually donated so far while the donors can stay in privacy by not revealing who actually sent the money. Also the people or companies being paid by the charity can make that choice. Let's say that charity collects money to buy blankets for homeless people and you are a company supplying these blankets. If you are paying your taxes you have every reason to support the whole enterprise by allowing every donor to see that the money was actually spent on blankets. Then you can use that money in privacy again after that step.
Thus user defined (or maybe usecase defined) privacy.

No. In case a coin split occurs you will have the same amount of coins on both chains but the exchange rate for either cannot be predicted. Most likely both coins will drastically go down first and then recover, each in its own way.

You know, funnily enough in a bar that has hosted Bitcoin meetups for like six years all the Bitcoiners _do_ stand together. Even when there are people who think we need bigger blocks now and not segwit there is never anything like that fighting and insulting and shit that we see online.
When meeting person to person people are very well capable of understanding that they are working towards the same goal and respecting each other and learning from each other and even if in the end they don't agree they still drink together and maybe even learned something.
Glad to hear you enjoyed your stay!

I could not care less about 'people'. If they want to use banks they are better off using fiat than Bitcoin. Whoever realises the advantages of crypto money over fiat will move to crypto exactly at that moment. If they don't, well, it's their desicion and their loss. 


All I can say to that is that I feel sorry for you to have to do that. But it does indeed explain why so many people are working on nonsense.

Can you please let me know what world that is which has no problems with banks? I would consider moving there actually. :)
You may have missed one point here: Bitcoin was explicitly developed to make banks and other middlemen obsolete. That is its main idea and intention. And that is also its power. Use it through banks and you take its power away.

@_date: 2019-05-07 11:44:26
The obstacle for Bitcoin adoption is the ignorance of the vast majority of our fellow human beings and their carelessness for things like freedom, liberty and self empowerment.
People don't give a fuck about freedom so as long as fiat somehow works for them they will stick to it.
Actual adoption of Bitcoin on a massive scale will only occur when the fiat system goes up in flames and all its believers realise that they should better get the better money. Not one minute earlier.
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:05:14
I am pretty sure a centralized, fully controlled and regulated coin will take over Bitcoin in terms of adoption and market cap in the mid term.
In the early days of the internet there were private platforms like Compuserve and AOL that were not as free and permissionless as the internet itself but they were easier to use and promoted with unlimited corporate funds. They had more users and better interfaces and better functionality than the internet itself. It took a while before these islands dissappeared and everybody moved on to use the free and permissionless original.
I can see the same happening in the cryptocurrency space, whereas none of the corporate attempts can sustain against Bitcoin in the long run (as they will have the same flaws as fiat currencies).
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:38:33
You hold your horses too man!
Look, I am absolutely with you on all the fuck banks and hold your own keys and all, I even know your username because you usually see the world similar to how I see it. I bash Coinbase and Bitpay whenever I get a chance.
But if I want to convince an employee to accept Bitcoin for their wages I need to show them a way how to pay their rent and their electricity with it and Bitwala really is the best option out there atm because you hold your own keys and they have no control over people's funds on the Bitcoin side.
Plus this company has a track record of sticking with the community which they showed when they were amongst the first ones who screamed "NO2X, no corporate coin!" a while ago.
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:35:05
So back in the days we had built the press-center on bitcoin.org (that page is long gone) with a few names and faces on there who could be contacted by journalists who wanted to write about Bitcoin. That was a time when the community was still able to track every mention of Bitcoin in the media worldwide as there was not much. People wanted me on there as we had generated tons of positive media coverage for Bitcoin in Berlin.
Since the seven or nine people on that page were sorted alphabetically I was last not next to anyone else on the list which gave me a sort of prominent position already. Mike Hearn (also long gone) asked me what job description he should put next to my name and I told him to make it "bartender and crypto-economist".
Next day he mails me back telling me that that were too many characters, did not fit on the page, so he changed it to "business owner" because, well I did own a business :).
Turned out that someone at Chinese tv (CCTV) wanting to make a short documentary on Bitcoin had taken that a bit too literally so they actually came to Berlin to interview the "business owner" of Bitcoin. 
They were slightly confused that this guy received them at a Kreuzberg style rock'n'roll bar / restaurant instead of in an office building and I only realized their mistake when they asked "when did you found the company?" and it dawned upon me that they didn't mean the bar but Bitcoin itself.
It still turned out a nice interview and positive coverage back in China and I still have the USB stick they gave me as a present as a souvenir and also because I never dared to use a USB stick given to me from any government organisation ;).

No, the BAFin never told anyone what license would be needed and that is the problem. If they would have said you need a banking license then someone having a banking license would have rolled out the machines by now. So if you run an ATM now they will ask you if you have the proper license but not tell you which one that would be.
It is an efficient way for an administration to stall development this way without having to actually deal with the issue and argue why something is not allowed. In Germany they did just that with the internet itself and that is why Germany is doomed to be a developing country in the digital age.

I appreciate your thinking and also your analogy with the burnt house and the picture of the ashes.
But it is not correct as ashes of a house are not of value to anyone and neither is a picture of it but Bitcoin does give us a tool which we never had before and which holds many promises that we can already see being fulfilled. Talk about unconfiscatable store of wealth, talk about cross-border payments not giving a shit about capital controls, hell, I could donate to wikileaks when Bitcoin was the only option.
These are possibilities that make Bitcoin absolutely valuable for me personally. Yes, this is a very subjective value but then any value is always purely subjective as long as we are not talking about food for the starving or water for a person dying of thirst.
In your thinking it would also be the case that the internet has no value even though people use it to communicate and exchange information, which is obviously valuable to them. And in the same way Bitcoin allows me to exchange or store value, which also obviously valuable for me and for other people as well.

Also you do not "buy or sell" with electrum, you merely receive and send with it.
The difference in fiat value is most likely due to the fact that electrum takes the exchange rate from somewhere else than where you bought your Bitcoins. The amount in Bitcoin you send to your wallet will always arrive there in full.

You call it a circle jerk but it actually was the most successful media campaign for Bitcoin so far.
When  we hit major news outlets with this story almost two years ago it were the first media reports not portraying Bitcoin as a hacker tool for criminal activities but as a slick new payment method with benefits both for individuals and for society at large.
It was aimed precicely at people outside the community who are usually not much interested in finances, hacking, cryptotech to introduce it to them and to be able to influence the way it is being introduced with target-group adequate messages worked out by communication- and branding professionals.
It has by now reached tens of millions (maybe 100+ mio) of people all over the world in dozens of languages by web, print, tv and radio. Show me a more successful pro-Bitcoin-campagne, will you?
Please note: reaching out of the community is the precice opposite of a circle jerk. You are the only circle-wanker here, obviously moaning around inside this board complaining to Bitcoiners.
This kind of critisism usually comes from people who themself have never done anything for the community. Please proof me wrong and tell me what you did for the success of Bitcoin to show me that you have a legitimate reason to ridicule this campagne.
Have a nice day!

@_date: 2013-11-12 03:30:13
Well it is just the procedure of someone else somewhere else on the planet paying someone's bill remotely. 
Transfering the amount and the payment address to someone else via email or any other digital means (forum pm, facebook pm, whatsapp and whatnot) and that other person triggering a bitcoin transaction actually goes through faster than a normal credit card or ec-card payment from someone locally.
We had a guy from Australia standing at the bar here the other day having three large beers and having each of them individually paid by three different friends at home. He was laughing his tits off after each payment and insisted on being allowed to watch our android tablet to hear the sound of the incomming payments and they were allways there before he had finished that particular beer :). 
It is fucking great to see bitcoin-enthusiasts enjoy using our favourite currency to pay for normal stuff like dinners and drinks. And it is in my opinion at the same time very important to demonstrate to the rest of the world how this is a very useful tool and give them the possibility to make first hand experiences in normal day-to-day situations. 
Real life application to things, which everybody does in situations, which everybody is familiar with. I mean everybody, not you geeks, but your moms and mine and their friends.
And then tell them that nobody had to pay 3% or 15% to anyone and that neither would Obama be able to stop the payment nor could Schaeuble confiscate it. These are moments in which people who would otherwise not research bitcoin online start thinking about it. You can actually see it on their faces and then they start asking questions and digging into it :).
