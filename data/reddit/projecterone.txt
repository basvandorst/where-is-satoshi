That's some serious dough, I presume money isn't an issue for you.
This made me think, I wonder if there's a system for giving them to the Pineapple fund or another charity upon death? A hardware wallet with a delayed donation mode would be cool - plug it in when reading the will and it sends to a predefined address.
I'd like mine to not die with me if possible.

You've seen through and the answer is: no one knows what's right.

I enjoyed that. [Its not the fall that hurts]( for your consideration.

I've paid for graphics cards, eBay sales (unofficially) and illicit chemicals with crypto (not just bitcoin). Just because it's not had mass adoption yet doesn't stop people using it as a currency.

I'm confused, you thinks banks exist to stop 


How exactly do you think they are in control of the stock market for example?

With a parent like that.... It.is.inevitable.
Seriously though, chances of breeding seem low thankfully.

Yea you're right of course, I just think it's a little unfair to say


It can be and is used just not without the interaction with fiat yet as you say.

That's just like.... your opinion bro. Seriously though, OP isn't 'grossly misinformed' just had a different view of things to you. Maybe try to be less confrontational, you don't know it all either.

Depends on your local electricity price and the efficiency of your mining equipment (read GPU's). Stick some numbers in [here]( My GTX 1060 can do 20MH/s at 90W I think, about 23 cents per KWH so no not worth it.

I'm not saying it's saving anything just that there can be uses that aren't illegal. I used a popular example, cool your jets. Also transaction fees aren't that high, 50sat/byte in under an hour today.

I'm guessing a plateau here for a while then a drop, I try to only look at the monthly charts though and obviously this is a total guess.

Nice image. I wonder how painful the transition will be? I imagine the petro-dollar won't go quietly.
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:21:28
Well like you say cashing back into USD. They could also not allow crypto gains in other fiat to be transferred back to USD, not effectively maybe but it'd put off average Jo. They could also work with other countries and put pressure on their allies; for example my bitch ass country would fold like a wet leaf. I'm not suggesting it'll happen but untill crypto has a fully functioning internal economy i.e. I can live a year only spending crypto then it's vunerable. Personally I think it's too big to hold down, like the internet in the early 90's.

I bought 0.5 in Feb 2017. Sold a little in Dec And the rest today. I enjoyed that but a year is enough time to be checking the price. I feel I've earned my little profit, if it shoots back up I'll honestly be happy for those who bought late 2017 to be back in profit. Good luck bitcoin.

I did something similar to this, you're not alone. Obviously a regret but now I'm on the sidelines it's all a lot more fun and a lot less stress. You did the best with the information you had, that's what I'll tell myself in a few months if it moons.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:26:51
Any idea why it's bouncing off that level? Seems oddly regular, a whale(s) selling at that price point?
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:10:30
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:23:50
You made the best decision you could with the info at hand. Don't feel bad, I have friends who bought for the first time at 19k. I sold the last of mine at 7k, meh it could be worse; mates gf is 2k in the red from day trading.
