Yes, but nobody would follow the other end of the fork, since it's not secure.

As far as I know, when routing payments through the network, each channel has to have enough funds to forward the payment.
For example, if you want a payment from A to C, but the current network consists of A, B and C, connected as such:
A &lt;-&gt; B &lt;-&gt; C
In this case there are two channels, AB and BC.
Let's say that the AB channel has allocated the balances of 2000 for A and 1000 for B, while the BC channel has 200 for B and 0 for C.
If A wanted to pay 200 to C, it could route it like so: Pay 200 to B using the channel, bringing the channel balances to 1800 and 1200, and then have B pay 200 to C, bringing the balances of the B channel to 0 and 200.
If then, B wanted to pay something to C, it would not be possible on the LN, because in that channel, B has no funds left.
My main point is that B cannot transfer funds from the AB channel to the BC channel, so a LN channel with 0 funds on both sides would always remain like that. B's total balance is not changed when it closes all its channels, but B's ability to pay funds to C is gone until a new channel opens.

There's a great amount of literature around that will explain it 100 times better than someone on this subreddit. Check the sidebar, do some Google searches.

What would a channel with 0 funds on each side accomplish?

The time to mine a block doesn't depend on the block's size. If it did, everyone would mine empty blocks with just the reward transactions, since those would be faster and thus yield a longer chain, as well as still give the reward to the miner.
