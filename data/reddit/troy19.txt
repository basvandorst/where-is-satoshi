So when you check your balance on line and make a transaction , do they immediately deposit it back into your account? Sorry, I haven't used their service yet so I am a bit new to this.

So is he saying that all Coinbase accounts are stored off line?

I don't know. I had some questions the other day on how Coinbase keeps your coins in cold storage and I find people were pretty helpful. I also watched the bitcoin newbie videos and did a lot of reading on my own so in fairness, I didn't ask simple questions like "What is a wallet?" If you watch most of the videos on youtube, it's pretty straight forward. That being said, I still think the whole security thing is confusing as hell and to STILL be hearing stories where people set up online wallets, do nothing and get the wallets emptied is a bit ridiculous IMO. If people want this to go mainstream, the theft and paranoia aspect of bitcoin has to be addressed. It's still the wild west out there. I think that's why so many people are inquisitive. They are afraid because a day doesn't go by without you hearing about someone being robbed.

What does this mean? I understand that you are giving them some bitcoin but I don't understand why this appears?

I guess what I don't understand is why is it that there is such a security risk in owning bitcoins where a simple https server with security (like a bank would do) is not enough to keep the coins safe? Why does it seem as though the coins are inherently less secure than standard bank deposits to the point they have to be stored on paper as opposed to electronically?
