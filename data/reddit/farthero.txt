and we need the atmosphere to breathe, does that mean that we aren't living because if the atmosphere was suddenly gone we would die?
the internet is like the atmosphere, not like a pond that can be dried up, moved, diverted, whatever.
and like the internet being sabotaged with ddos and shit, the atmosphere can be fucked up with aerosol.
I kind of agree with the sentiment about government though, like with the dark web, the cahnge needs to happen politically and any subversion of the law is wasted energy, you have to win the hearts and minds of the people and lawmakers, make the appeal to not fuck up the internet in some certain way.  DHT and torrenting helps immensely with immunizing against state/local/regional shenanigans and if adopted enough really opens up many untouched possibilities like decentralized currency.

Hopefully people start to realize how resilient and trustworthy the blockchain is, and more use it directly without a mediator, on the differences in merit alone.
The ones flaunting their "Bitcoin will crash and burn" attitude are probably still frothing and trying to figure out why it hasn't happened.  This isn't your standard centralized entity to crush and make an example out of!  *This* car can hold up for *all* of the trips, even though some of the drive-in theaters might fold.

not my point at all
not talking about the practicality of learning through reading books
it's a philosophical (maybe?) argument
was saying "you don't know what you don't know" basicly
green was saying something like "I KNOW WHAT THE FIRST WIDGET X WAS"
then i said "YOU DONT KNOW THAT"
then he said "YEAH I DO BECAUSE IT IS IN A BOOK"
well what about the ones that were in books that you didn't read or what even about all the widget xes that were never put into any books at all?
insignificant?  maybe... but to say they don't exist at all is assinine
just like paintings I'm sure there are ones far greater than the *Monna Lisa* out there that nobody but the artist has laid eyes on...
try and say to know is to not allow for the existence of things you don't know about is intellectually lazy
"it never existed unless it was significant enough to record"  is an arrogant statement, i think green realized that when he used the word popular
reduce it further and you get the "what can you know?" question
i think therefore i exist
that's the only thing you can honestly say "I KNOW" about

the wow servers produce wow gold from thin air
dont forget too that only 7% of the money supply we use is actual hard cash and the rest is just numbers in computers "from thin air"
without scarcity what you're left with is just dust in the wind
people are fucking terrified of the word scarcity because it doesn't mean money from nothing, and it does mean actual risk, not some phony risk that only matters in the short term while they crank up those printing presses to hyper-inflate their so called money, to hedge the so called risk.

ahh ok, i was talking about the other aspect, like dialing the wrong phone number (invalid or not) and hence the phone connection you wanted won't take place, not about "accidentally sending it to a wrong, but valid one"  I think dr1nfinite was talking about the same thing.
A QR code has Reed–Solomon error correction to help protect the underlying data (the address), but a phone conversation and phonetic spelling only go so far.
Manually accurately conveying bitcoin addresses by voice alone is probably a pain.
we want to avoid both, jut nobody needs to worry about your scenario, and everyone needs to mind getting the phone number right to begin with
