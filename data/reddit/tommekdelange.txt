Actually the ruling described in the article is only about bitcoin 'ownership' and not about mining and/or trading so i don't think Localbitcoins will be unblocked soon while it is still illegal. At least that is what i read here.

Bitcoin Bravado thinks that institutions are behind the bitcoin rally. I think they might be right. Here’s the citation:
“OK, institutions don’t proclaim their investments publicly, but there’s much to glean from the lack of retail involvement in the current move. Take a look at the Google Trend chart at the bottom of this post. The spike that looks like Mt. Everest was at the pinnacle of the crypto boom in late 2017 and early 2018.
See the tiny blip all the way to the right? The one that’s still eclipsed by a surge of interest in May of this year? That’s us right now. If searches for ‘bitcoin’ are still hovering just above all-time lows, then where is this pump coming from? Retail buyers have yet to jump in here, and mainstream media is still very far from the sort of coverage it produced two years ago.
The spike in BTC price has also been accompanied by an astounding increase in volume that can only be the result of heavy-handed buying power. 
According to Diar.co:
“Over 26% of circulating supply ($36Bn worth of Bitcoin) now sit in addresses that have a balance of 1000–10k BTC. In August 2018, when Bitcoin was also at $8000, these ‘Firm Size’ addresses held under 20% of the circulating supply, showing a sharp accumulation of nearly 7% in less than a year.”
As expected, the bear market bottom which occurred around the holidays last year gave ‘Firm Size’ addresses the ability to accumulate and provide the firm ground upon which the current rally now stands. Retail holdings remain steady – so, considering that institutional demand has sharply risen, all of the ingredients are in place for BTC to continue its monumental run.”
