I hope people putting addresses around for donations doesn't become a thing

In that case they get the price when you're able to buy.

The irony is your advice was fine... but just give the advice for free or potential upvotes, that's the value of Reddit. Steemit might be a good place to get paid for contributing content.

You can't predict it reliably and if you're asking this you (like me) aren't an expert in crypto so don't try to play like one. Instead just buy a little bit regularly. 
Buy some now, but keep cash on the side to buy more later in case it does go down. Always try to save cash and make more cash to be ready for any obvious dips.

But then Hold On for Dear Life made perfect sense to apply to it after.

I use it all day every day, keeps getting better, I barely open Google Chrome any more.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:44:01
I spend them regularly, and just buy more of them.

And it never is. My wife bullies me and tells me it's all just made up numbers on the phone, and she's right. Shit goes up and down like crazy all the time but I love the funny roller coaster.

Sure, I'm willing to lose it, because I'm cool and a badass, yeeha. But really, it's just craptastic service from beginning to end, is my point. If it's relevant, I'm not even trying to get into trading, I just want to buy and have a chunk of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-18 01:04:45
After having these problems, I search Reddit and other forums and see that these and related service problems are common. Do a search in r/bitcoin and elsewhere and you'll see what I'm talking about.

What account? And my experience isn't valid or worth mentioning, is what you're saying? I should just quiet my voice and not let anyone know because it isn't the same exact experience as yours?
@_date: 2017-04-17 23:19:25
Nope, I'm trying to share the information of my experience so others can be aware of the possibility that it could happen to them. I am not feeling sorry for myself. 
*These requirements were never expressed anywhere, at any time, at any point in their process leading up to my approval and my submission of funds.* If these requirements were stated, I wouldn't have used their exchange and would have used another exchange.
I am not alone in having such experiences, so it is not just a 'me' problem.
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:54:33
That's all I wanted to do, buy some Bitcoin. I've been trying to do so via them for weeks, and it's still all I want to do. I got the hardware wallet ready to hold it, just trying to buy it and despite tons of effort haven't been able to do so.
@_date: 2017-04-06 15:03:25
DM'ed, thank you
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:27:08
And now, after waiting all this time I'm told that my passport picture isn't good enough because all 4 corners of it can't be seen.... But all 4 corners of it can been seen and it's a super high resolution image... This is just too much, I'm giving up on this and trying a different exchange. Your service has wasted way too much of my time.
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:59:41
I know, I gave them all those documents. And they approved me for Tier 3. (which took weeks, by the way) Great, wired them money.  
Then after they have my money (!) they ask for documents they never asked for and never even mentioned anywhere in their literature - and that I am not able to provide. They want a scan of my social security card and proof of the nature of my employment - I can't get that scan because it's in a safe deposit box and I'm abroad. 
Sothey have my money but won't let me buy Bitcoin.
And now I'm struggling to get my money back and start all over again somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-04-17 23:32:25
The problem is your side is asking me for documents after already having approved me, after clearing me to go ahead and send money, and after Kraken already has my money on your side.
Then, Kraken says, oh no wait (now that we have your money) - we need things from you that we never, ever mentioned possibly needing.
And this is after weeks of already giving Kraken all the other documentation requested. It's infuriating.
@_date: 2017-04-18 01:50:13
They never knew what country I was in or that I was out of the country so that wasn't it prticularly. It's that they're asking for things after I had already been approved *and sent them money* that I cannot have access to. If I had ever known they would require those documents, I wouldn't have used them because I would have known it wouldn't have been able to work out. But critically, they never mentioned they were going to require them.
And the kicker is I'm not receiving my money back.
@_date: 2017-04-19 00:12:36
Wait a minute. Kraken is mentioned as recommended in the Wiki of this sub. I have had a bad customer experience with them. I think others should be be aware of the bad service I received *and the fact, for example, that I still haven't gotten my $12,000 back from them*. Anecdotal experiences in aggregate are helpful.
That isn't worth sharing? It is exactly worth sharing.
What are you, a Kraken shill? Because you're only accentuating the negative perception of my experience with them.  
@_date: 2017-04-17 04:43:00
I just gotta say, this has turned out to be one of the worst customer experiences I've had in a long while. I did everything, got approved, sent my money so I can buy some Bitcoin and then your side started asking for all kinds of extra crap that was never asked for in the beginning.
Fine, whatever, I want out, just give my money back, I'm tired of this. And I still don't have my money back... (12,000 USD)
Worst customer service experience in a long time. Am posting a warning to others everywhere I can and appealing to the mods of this forum to have you guys removed as a suggested place to do business with.

"I wanted to use the services this company claimed to offer, as advertised - but they misstated their requirements, processes and quality of service. They did not answer customer support emails and continue to not give my money back."

I bet a rare tulip perfectly preserved and encased from that she would be worth something now.
Like memorabilia, I think in any case unless the system gets hacked and liquidated, BTC would always have value as the most popular original.

80% alts, well now like 75%, ha. I'm hoping people feel adventurous with some of their new gainz!

Pardon the pedantry, it is a good post.

But potentially slower, if that matters, if for example you think you should ditch the new one before it crashes lower in price.

 I'm still 10% BTC though, so... yay?!

Not necessarily, I intend to pass my cryptocurrency down to my kid. A personal situation preventing me from doing so is unlikely.  Whatever crap happens in the world well sure maybe that would change things, but apart from that, am holding and not selling and it's logical.

When you use 2 factor authentication, every time you add an account, don't just scan the QR code, but also copy down the accompanying digit version. 
In case you lose your phone or get a new one you can use that to reset the 2FA for that account, otherwise you may be locked it or have a pain in the ass retrieval process.
