It's a signal that they're /avoiding/ calamity. Just like NYSE did
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:53:21
Eventually yes, and much higher. You just have to give it time for the market to stabilize itself

There are online wallets, but you have to trust they wont steal your bitcoins =P But yeah, if you can get the wallet.dat file then you can recover your bitcoins

I use coinbase. It's super simple and easy
Try it out? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:30:58
I'm pretty sure you can get banned on eBay for selling bitcoins. I'm not 100% sure but you should double check

CPU mining wont get you anywhere. GPU mining is like 100x faster and its close to being obsolete with the ASICs coming around

Depends. I mean if monday the low is 150 and tuesday the high is 50... prolly don't wanna sell, ya know? But no matter the price, if you sell for more than you bought it for you'll make profit. Just make sure you don't gamble more than ~15% of what you have to lose (at a time) or you might really regret it. Play it safe
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:21:45
Oh jeez, I didn't even think of that @_@
Thank you!

Depends on the wallet, but if you can recover the wallet.dat file then you can restore it and get your bitcoins back (assuming you remember your passphrase)

Apparently a bunch of bots would sell 0.01-0.02 or so, and another bot would buy for 0.01-0.02... from themselves, all it charged on the person controlling it was the small charge each transaction.
BUT, someone did a huge sale (7000btc? im not sure) that dropped the value 80 USD, and during the drop people who had bids had their transactions process, which added a LOT of lag to the server. Especially with those bots. 
Because people saw that the chart was 20+ minutes behind, they thought it was gonna crash (to the point where btc is worthless, mind you) and sold their bitcoin in a panic. 
Unfortunately, that's still the case now. People are selling in a panic and not understanding that it's their own fault. 
Hopefully that summed it up for ya. Also, hold onto any coins you have (preferably offline) as once it picks up you'll get a good profit =P

The same way server hardware operates differently than consumer hardware. The electronics inside the machines are totally different. ASICs are /designed/ for mining literally only. They'd be slow as snot on simple tasks you do on your computer. 
Scam? I'm not sure anyone can answer that yet. It seems like they're backordered so far because they need money to mass produce. That's just my guess, but on their site it does say all sales are final and that you won't see the machine for a few months
With only 3000 I'd suggest buying now, while its low, and waiting for the market to pick back up (and yes, it will). Right now, with a high end machine(3k$), you'll get ~5.898 BTC a month 24/7 running. Factor in electricity costs... it's not that much (140 days to pay off the 3k, and then ~700 a month before paying electricity). In the end it's up to you. 
GPU mining will be obsolete and worthless in a few months, but at least that way if the market crashes you can sell the hardware haha
(Also, I suggest Slushs pool if you decide to mine)

Since I can't view your page to pm you, I'll sell mine for 205 USD each
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:23:14
Oh, I have no idea haha. My wallet reads from (and creates if none is there) a specific point and I can't change it. Cool idea, though. We need flexibility like that =P
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:49:16
Just hold and wait it out. If you can, buy some more to even out the net profit
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:26:00
There's actually a /lot/ of places that use bitcoins. Some don't make it obvious, but as you get deeper into bitcoin you'll see how nice it is. Best currency ever haha. Spread the word!
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:45:27
I was hoping it would hit 300 so I can afford to move next month &gt;&gt;
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:36:20
I agree with this, if you're gonna spend money do it investing instead of mining. There's gonna be waaaaaay too many people with ASICs for yours to make a difference

I use my dropbox to keep a backup of my wallet.dat and it saved me when i sold my desktop and bought a laptop. Im guessing the same thing applies here
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:08:01
Save up?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:48:47
Wait until mtgox is up to buy
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:39:54
No, it'll pull through and the payout will be great. It just needs time to stabilize
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:40:31
Exactly 
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:14:22
Definitely buy. It's something you wont want to regret later. Trust in BitCoin
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:41:55
Same here, the UI is really easy to use and the differences in performance don't seem like that much
