Not being able to pay by debit/credit card =/= lagging behind in payment technologies.
America is cultured to promote borrowing via credit and using plastic cards. That's the nature of our system, and why we're in debt. Always about fast money.
in the UK, credit cards are unheard of and only used by low income individuals. They rarely use debit cards, by choice, too. They don't believe in a credit system and don't even have a credit report. Getting a mortgage for a house solely relies on your income and familial history -- no credit.
Japan may be employing a simliar system where credit /borrowing is dissuaded.

Yep. Saw they dumped PayPal. Now they can accept bitcoin.

Yeah most of the news reports say that BTC is going to skyrocket during/after Chinese New Year. Hodl tight :D

Your source is undeniably biased.
If we use a credit card source, then even Japan is using it as "one of the most popular methods of payment" quoted from The Japan Consumer Credit Association (JCA). Why are you lying?

One small step for coinbase, one giant step for bitcoin!

Japan's strength is tech and cars. It's the mainstay of their economy. Being technologically behind can put their whole country at risk.
They're going all in on crypto because they don't want to risk being fk'd. It's low-risk too. Accepting crypto doesn't exactly bring any risks except for governmental destabilization, and that can easily be remedied.

Too many paragraphs stuck together. Hid the real story in too many words.
Basically, guy was into poker, lost all his cash, remembered he bought 300 bitcoins. asked his mom. found the computer. then sold the bitcoin for litecoin. litecoin went up 3x. he made more.
then he rants about how bad centralized banks are and that the dollar is inflated. Bitcoin has more real value than the dollar. says BTC is the future.

Lol, that reception area looks exponentially better than all of coinbase's website . Looks more functional than the site too.
Maybe they should move to the offline exchanging of btc. Really looks like they would be better at it, I can see a receptionist there by that easy to use cellphone stand ready to facilitate the scanning of qr codes with a smile

For alts, a slow increase is beautiful. For bitcoin it's not so great because people want to see rapid recovery from a devastating crash. A gradual recovery makes it look like the crash was the real price.
