A few quick calculations:
at 1.4MW, he is using about 1022700 KWh/month, and at $0.10/KWh (probably high for that area of WA) his electric bill is about $102K
If he has 20,000 square feet, paying $12/sqft (probably also high for the area) his cost is $20K/month.
So it is probably safe to say his total costs are $150K/month.
He said his income is $8 million in BTC/month, which would be  $4.5 million if they were counting it at the $1120 figure from December mentioned in the vid.  
Rather profitable at that scale....

Ok, go back to 06-April-1933 and tell that to the president, when he issued Executive Order 6102 "forbidding the Hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States". 
The order criminalized the possession of monetary gold by any individual, partnership, association or corporation.
It only became legal again in 1975.
Don't be so confident; they can ban anything they want any time they want, on any pretext they think might work.  (of course, they also have to enforce the ban, that went real well with Prohibition of Alcohol in the 1920s, the war on drugs, file sharing, etc...)

The big open question is the cost of the mining hardware and the cost of the financing (or opportunity cost) on those funds.

Glad to hear of your good luck and lesson learned!
A similar precaution that I often do before sending a significant amount of BTC is to actually send a really minimal-sized transaction, then verify that it is going through before sending the actual amount.   I mostly think of it as a systems check, but it would also catch the type of error you walked into.
