Bitcoin income caps, the internet is a bunch of tubes and those peasants can’t be flooding the market with their pennies. We Need Bitcoin Data-velociraptor Caps.

Not really. It just plants the idea to invest in bitcoin on the mass transport system of nyc.

You have to consider, Russia is only 200b in debt. I find that interesting because historically, truth and history plays hand in hand with the kings treasury, wealth and power!

Gdax used to not work on mobile. Thanks for the update.

It’s easier. But higher transaction fees that won’t be made back on a 5% gain. But you can use Coinbase pro (gdax) at a fraction of the cost, but there’s no app for that.

My savings account has a better roi atm. But at least bitcoin isn’t backed by the usd ��‍♂️. Anyone else out there ever think about the trend of debt in the hands of a few media outlets that get people elected based on stereotypes versus serving private interests and the outcome of the usd?

So what does this mean for bakkt?

Diversify. Pretend you are donating the money you put in and you’ll never see it again. And don’t sell until your imaginary goal is met.

You won’t see the force fed narrative FUD that way!
Edit for irony while I’m browsing on the duckduckgo iOS browser. I still need to see both sides of the coin!

Yes, universal currency. cryptocurrency created what the new world order has wanted for ages, a global currency. Ironically, it destroys what they made.

Everyone’s afraid of updicking because of good FUD?

notice the new account comment trend, it is [big dump]( This probably means something opposite for a gain.
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:47:03
Meh. And viral news never did anything on reddit.

Also, the other end is that these comments expose the narrative to others.

**Summary to below line:** To what end? The market low was 5k, they wanted to push it lower to enter the market with a larger sum of $ to their own interest. So this is an attempt to regain that narrative for that one end. On the opposite, a new wildcard narrative entered the market place through a democratic collective beyond this narrative of control, a large enough sum to challenge that former trend. The serious rebound we see. 
I definitely agree here with you. I've been studying numbers in marketing trends (I'm a creative/so I have full access to numbers and then physically design campaigns and create impacts on numbers) over the years within my own business to another. Today my counter intuition saw this serious rebound. While my previous intuition was tracking the bottom as being 3k about two months ago. Now that's being blasted. So to get to the point. 
**To what end:** The narrative may have been broken. Blasting the group thought, hive mind, to sell or hold demoralizes the foundation. The same plan/strategy/narrative to achieve has been there for more than 2 months in the line work/numbers up to down. **So it's to what means:** There's a few, a lot of people would gain a lot if crypto did not exist; to a lower market value with a larger investment means a huge return (invest huge sum at 10k to a 30k peak or 3k to a 30k?). That's the narrative line work trying to be achieved (10x gain), or dismantle (crypto destabilizes centralized banking). 
**The serious rebound/a new "end":**
NOW, throw a wildcard player into the market, a large sum could cut-in-line to de-rail that narrative, as they are not a part, not included in it. Now 3k becomes the carrot on the stick. Why do I think this? A huge push went out on television that appealed to the people who fund wall-street to switch to crypto as a huge gain. Now these new wild card players have been sitting on that sum waiting to enter the market over the past few months. They cut-in-line, and the narrative changes. Sure, if they wait, then they could lose a lot more than going in now. As the counter opposition, current narrative, has the same ability to push the market up. So the trend up would skyrocket in a competition between getting in before the margins close due to risk. 
To what end? The comment trend would be the last ditch effort to stop that wild-card narrative that is entering the market. But it only works so much before that strategy no longer works.

Of course, I was looking at it that day. I only see the bots moving 20-30 btc at a time around $100 differences. But there were some major walls stacked at 350+btc, 100+BTC, 100+BTC before going below 7k in $10 increments. Then a few 100+ before then. That's why the hold that day never broke 7k. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:24:30
Yeah, see. I saw where he was coming from, but that amount of difference at that distance just needed nearly 1/3 of the wall to fall. It was just too high of a difference, and so it never fell below 7.3k and here we are ar 8.3k
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:58:41
True dip* this isn't it. Why? We were here nearly last week. Btc couldn't fall past 7.3k. So this has been more of a stable $1k up and down in "dips" with 8.2/3k as the base. The stable days changed by 300 to $500. The previous dip lows have been in 3k drops. This makes sense as the months high 11.6k. Making 8.2/3k nearly a 3k dip (but far exceeding that at 7.3k: so 1k more in behavior change). With that said. We could guess that this "true dip". If it happens will be around 4-5k. As the market on went up by 2k after hitting 7k then back down. Baselining 8k. That's my anticipation. People were saying 3k at a point. But that may never happen.
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:24:49
And here we are at 8.3k

Basically, someone used money to do something evil? That's all I'm gathering here, then the other half: money is evil, ban it like guns. It's all a "how can we sway the black sheep with unexpected 'power'."
Edit: bitcoin is the black sheep** everyone is watching it.
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:23:10
There's over 50million waiting to be bought before 6K. And there is less than 20mil willing to be sold before 9.3k. The wall will tip before a low 6k.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:32:12
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:31:36
Yeah, something like that. Layman terms: the price will skyrocket in little time what's so-ever. *Skyrocket: $400 or so spike up.* Buy past the books, aka buy all the coin being sold at that time (let's say 100btc at 7k). Throw 200btc at that "wall" and you'll break it up and bring the sales up (as you push by automated sale bots at 1btc per $5+ increases at buys). On a good day (like this). People get hyped and buy into the upwards market. Then they sell the 200btc at a good buyback wall and the market falls by the days end; you see that same market drop in minutes, especially when growth is neutral/stagnant that day.
