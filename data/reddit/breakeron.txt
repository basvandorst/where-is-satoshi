I would hope that all Bitcoin users care about currency recognition. The reason the China market is all but dead, is because of Bitcoin not being an actual currency. Even the IRS has declared it a bartering item, which impacts how we handle taxes on our BTC sales/transactions.

Quite the opposite. Believing in something, and sitting around doing nothing, is lazy. I care enough about Bitcoin to act. Action leads to progress, and progress leads to change. Being proactive about the promotion of currency that I agree with on a fundamental level, does not make me a money-grabber.
I have a couple bitcoins, I couldn't make enough money off of what I had to justify a massive corporation level escapade. This isn't a tinfoil hat topic, and I am not trying to ruin Bitcoin.

I agree with the manpower issue! But, the pBTC would basically just provide anti-theft. For example, if you are locked in a vault and pocket some cash, where can you go? No where, until the vault opens back up, and even then you will be searched.

Not everyone uses the internet for videos (especially the older business owners).

I will see if i can write code to allow side-chains, but as of now, none exists. There seems to be a big talk about them, but no implementations. Any ideas? I am using this post a user-driven thinktank; we all want Bitcoins to be secure, and recognized by all Governments as a valid currency, so at least we all have the sameish goal.

I updated the project page to mention chargebacks, and how SimBit is different. Also, we have 3 people working on the project: me (security and programming), mykl (programming and server administration), and James (marketing, and social engineering).

Produce them without the complex problems.
Think of it like this: you mine gold in a mine and it gets added to the global supply. If you melt the gold into a coin (say a US golden dollar), you don't have to re-mine the gold to do so. 
This allows the same bitcoins to be used in side chains, which may follow different protocols, e.g., reversible transactions (like my protocol, pBTC).

Update : The idea to use a side-chain to implement protected BTC is a great idea. I am playing around with a way to "suspend" BTC, so a side-chain can be implemented.
Any ideas?
EDIT: Greg Maxwell came up with a way of two-way pegging.
