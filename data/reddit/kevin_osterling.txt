If bitcoin becomes the digital gold ultimate store of value, yes assets will change hands, you BUY the Oil/whatever with you valued coins, they own devalued US$/Euros/otherfiat.

The cycle repeats but, you cant print more bitcoins to distort economy/ markets.

Bitcoin and Altcoins price doesn't go up because of the 1% concentrated richness. There's not enough money saved out there without the 1%s money.

You are a miner but "thats it". Both brute force and crypto cost money (capital). Try again.
