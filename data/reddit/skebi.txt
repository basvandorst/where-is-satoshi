How much will be approximately mined until the halving?

Did anyone check the Public Key he used in the video?
@_date: 2019-07-29 19:03:01
I guess it depends on from where you are but if you pay your taxes that shouldn't be a problem.
I'd suggest to buy only from sellers with very good reputation.
@_date: 2019-07-29 18:56:07
Except that the seller already sent the Bitcoins to BISQ and they are held in the escrow.

Nice. Do you have a simple tutorial on how to set this up? 
@_date: 2019-03-03 17:44:22
Unfortunately yes. Mining fee is calculated on the transaction size. Sometimes a 2$ transaction has the same size of a 20$ transaction = same fee. 
@_date: 2019-03-09 17:33:46
China has not just one Power Supply/Source. If for example the 3 gorges dam gets damaged, a lot of people and miners are without power but not 100% of China.

What do you mean with withdraw to a sender? If you send btc to someone you/bittrex are the senders and he is the recipient. 
When the transaction is confirmed the recipient is a lier and why did he send back the btc? 
@_date: 2019-03-10 21:07:59
Paper Wallet? 
@_date: 2019-03-30 17:33:07
Depends on the transaction fee you set. If it's 0 your transaction may get stuck in the pool. 
@_date: 2019-03-30 18:31:11
Mempool size is quite big since the past few days. I guess the only thing you can do is to wait.
I hope you don't need the funds urgently.

Miller is also referring to Bitpanda &amp; Bitcoin.de in his super expensive Weekly Newsletter "CryptoX".

Haha sounds great. I'll definetly post it after setting it up.

Yeah I know but is there a official analysis of his postings? I have never checked that.
Would be also interesting if he is a native speaker or if he makes spelling/grammatical mistakes. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 20:20:29
FIAT would be the best option though. Tether and all the other stable coins are just too risky for a long term hold.

Split the money and invest small parts over some months. No one knows how the price is going but accumulating is the "safest" way.

"Please just send me back my bitcoin that would show that you are a honest man"
@_date: 2019-08-07 18:31:14
Not true. When BTC is 100k one satoshi will be 0.001$.
We need Bitcoin to be worth 10 million that 1 sat = 10 cents.
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:00:38
Lol this is so awesome and this shitty scammer cries like a baby after you scammed him
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:32:00
Depends on how much you want to buy every month. Due to the fact that you value security, I'd guess you want to keep the private key to your BTC on your own wallet.
For example Kraken is very cheap but the withdrawal is 0,0005. This is very expensive when you only invest like 50$ a month.
If you invest 1k every month - Kraken would be the best choice.
@_date: 2019-06-09 13:23:52
Is this somehow possible from the European Union?

You are waiting for BTC to crash down to 16$ to break-even? Dude take some profits
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:54:45
Lol why are you talking about PayPal. Cashing in and out with PayPal is nothing but dumb.
@_date: 2019-06-14 18:09:07
Thank you. That's exactly what I wanted to know - the risk isn't worth it ����
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:28:14
Probably 30-50$ fees. So your profit would be around 450$.
For sure this depends on being a taker or maker.
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:19:48
It's a trap
@_date: 2019-06-14 15:48:57
Erm... My account can be hacked anyway? No matter if I sell BTC or not.
@_date: 2019-06-14 15:39:52
What's actually the risk when I sell BTC with PayPal on a P2P platform (and they send the money as a gift)?
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:51:03
+3000£ in one day? Would be an insane move.
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:28:14
I have received this too often now and I am still wondering how it's going on afterwards. I register on this "exchange" and then? How do they scam me? 
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:49:04
Lol that's insanely high. Move out of this country.
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:20:48
"I am in crypto because it is backed by mathematics and cryptography"
Just twist the 1
1 BTC =
100,000,000 (100 million $)
0.00000001 (1 satoshi)
1$ per satoshi
Then just divide it by 10:
1 BTC =
10,000,000 (10 million $) 
0.00000001 (1 satoshi) 
Divide it by 10 again:
1 BTC =
1,000,000 (1 million $) 
0.00000001 (1 satoshi) 
Now it's your turn ��

@_date: 2019-06-14 17:33:55
And if I buy it back on an exchange asap? ;)
@_date: 2019-02-10 19:40:00
Is KYC needed? 
@_date: 2019-06-14 15:53:13
That's a fair point...
As far as I know there is no chargeback when they send it as a gift? Do you know if this is true?
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:58:57
Lol compare the amount of upvotes. There is less hype now and tbh this is a good sign.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:33:30
It wasn't the ATH as you can read from one of the first comments.
Most of the upvotes happen in the first 24 hours. Let's bet that it won't reach more than 4000 upvotes by tomorrow 3pm (CEST). 10.000 Sats via Lightning? ;)
@_date: 2019-06-14 17:33:10
Because people are willing to pay slightly more and if I buy back on an exchange immediately, it's a good deal.
Definitely not a good deal when there is the possibility to get scammed ;)
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:08:16
Definitely not true. You can buy them online and offline for \~9€ per block. I have received mine today and you can still order them.
@_date: 2019-02-25 22:04:48

@_date: 2019-04-21 21:41:44
Well you also have to consider withdraw fees -&gt; not your Keys not your coins.
Kraken withdraw is pretty expensive if you invest 5$ a week. In terms of just investing with SEPA it's definitely one of the easiest and cheapest one but you have to leave your coins on the exchange.

Wikileaks BTC address is burning from donations!!!
@_date: 2019-09-01 15:22:30
If 1 BTC = 10 Million USD then 1 satoshi would be 1 $ cent.
1 $ cent is already useless cause you can't buy anything with that. 
When we reach that, the USD will be inflated af and 20 $ cents will be as worthless as 1 $ cent now. For that reason, I'd say this won't be a problem. 
Although, we can still fork and make smaller fractionals of a Bitcoin. For example 1 BTC = 1 billion satoshi.
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:49:06
You can buy an external hard drive with 1TB. Much cheaper an works too. Although you need a 8GB SD for the system.

This shows that Bitcoin is not perfect. I hope it will never happen again.

No problem. If you have questions do not hesitate to ask in the Git or here on Reddit!
@_date: 2019-09-14 16:33:00
Bug in code and a lot of Bitcoins got distributed to 2 Miner addresses. Someone noticed and satoshi forked btc and miners had to follow the "new" chain by updating.

Lightning is sick man! Download Blue Wallet on your mobile and try it out. It got pretty user friendly. 
Bcash and faketoshis are still around.
Transaction amount is the same (without lightning) as during the last ATH but we have lower tx fees due to segwit and less hype.
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:21:02
What's actually the reason for that? People don't set fees as high af anymore?
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:56:31
Why? Hyperinflation is a bitch
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:37:35
There is no price jump on bitmex cause they use the chart from other platforms.

Some say yes some say no. In my opinion it has a long term effect on the price and not an immediate price explosion. I think it did the "pre-work" for the past 2 bull runs. Let's see. Still 1 year to go!

@_date: 2019-05-22 21:33:17
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:26:53
Okay, I do understand your point. Maybe an implementation will be worth it when there are more people buying with BTC. Are you checking if you have received the alts or btcs manually for every order?  
Just ordered though and payed with XLM. Already looking forward to play "Schnapsn" (if you know it in Switzerland) with it.
btw: Is it a miscalculation that you only save 4$ when you order 16 decks?
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:09:45
