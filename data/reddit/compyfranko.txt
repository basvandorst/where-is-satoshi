It's called cliodynamics. It's not being taken seriously as a science yet, because it's conclusions threaten the people in charge. But it's as much of a science as any other economic study.

2020 is supposed to be the year it happens, based on the mathematics of societal trends. However, the global economic collapse is predicated upon the collapse of the US Dollar, the World Reserve Currency.

And that's where the finite Bitcoin comes in, to fill that niche right as the dollar collapses.
