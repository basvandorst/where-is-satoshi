What are you even doing here if you think that!!?
Bitcoin was created to be an anarchistic monetary system.  Regulate it and you break it.

well....  it is unfortunately "normal" for btc

Technically speaking, refusing to increase the block limit to 100 times the current maximum use level can be considered a very big change from the original protocol.
Regardless of whether a person believes keeping the blocks small is important for decentralization or not, we should be aware of how much of an extreme change it is from the original bitcoin that didn't have a block limit, and it only being added a year later when everyone realized a person could send a gigantic block and kill the network.
I remember there was some effort on trying to automatize a way for resetting the block limit, but it wasn't taken that seriously, since everyone at the time thought it was crazy that anyone could be convinced to not do it.  Although that concern was raised, by Satoshi, if I remember correctly.

Regardless of one's current views and positions, I believe it is important to understand the facts of the past.
And yea.. this is reddit..  it is a given that we're wasting our time..
Thanks for the conversation.  I hope you have a fun weekend.
@_date: 2018-08-03 13:22:43
The original bitcoin protocol didn't include the block limit, and when it was introduced the stated plan (ie [protocol]( was to keep it way above the current use level.
Protocol is the plan, not a value in the code.
I apologize, but I don't think I am understanding your argument.
@_date: 2018-08-03 13:11:27
You had a misquote in quote marks.  A paraphrase doesn't get quote marks.
And most importantly, what I said (to paraphrase) is that *not increasing the block limit was a change of protocol.*

The open source software world is full of forks that "hijacked" the name and resources and then changed the name a little for their own projects.  That's how open source works.
Keepass2 and KeepassX is a good example that comes to mind.

valid point...  but litecoin never had the intention of becoming "bitcoin" in the future.
I'm neither for that or against it presently.  Just saying that that is why.  And to complain about one side spitting on the other when they are both doing it is rather disingenuous.  I only care about furthering the technology and its use in the hopes of sucking away big bank's power and possibly making some extra cash in the process.

Not that far from 10k.  It has only been 4 months ago when the price was a third of what it is now.  So another 4 months till it hits 10k?
I doubt it too... but you never know.  Next year would be more realistic.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:02:57
But without that vision of an anarchistic currency and "banking" system, many would question why even bother?  Or are we defining "vision" differently?

Or maybe the whole thing flops and a fork takes over.  always a possibility.

Yea.. good time to buy ;]
Interesting that Bitcoin Cash has been going up a lot as well recently.   I haven't gotten a good read on why that is though.  The only thing I can think of is there have been a few more announcements from certain sites/services switching from core to cash recently due to the fees. But that has been happening for a while...  so I don't believe that is the reason.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:38:43


Maybe Erik just got out voted by the other names listed.  Or more likely he has the view that if this is just going to result in another fork, then why bother.  Since there is already another fork that he likes.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:31:20
I do understand that.  That is my point.  Trust is only temporary if the reason it was created in the first place is no longer there.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:28:32
I couldn't agree more.  Which all begs the question of why the adversity directed at a small block chain increase to help in the short term.  The scaling complaints are always about really big block sizes in the theoretical future.  I'm not understanding this argument against the small block increase and why it would be a problem in the short term or long term.  Can anyone help explain this to me?
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:17:34
Or were just ignorant.  Which is a common malady in this area.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:03:34


You mean, "IF" a fix comes in...  BTC is already broken as a competitive crypto currency and has been for far too long of a time.  As a guy who has just recently come back into it after ignoring it since 2013 the difference is extremely shocking.  It seems that people who have been into it the whole time or only started recently aren't seeing how drastic the change has been since it slowly snuck up on them while they were distracted by the gains.
Seems to me that the branding is the main reason for success right now. Might as well be an ICO, pretty web site or not.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:14:28
It appears that there are more businesses who take BCH as payment than there are who take Litecoin.  I think the numbers for BCH is over 1500 now.  I couldn't find any numbers for LTC.  Search kept bringing up BTC numbers.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:26:00
They do have bitcoin information and software right on the site.  You have to dig for the other stuff.  And its all decentralized,  it is just as relevant as all the other sites like bitcoin unlimited and bitcoin ABC etc etc.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:28:46
That doesn't work against the main goal of it being the main world currency, regardless of different people's actual intentions.  Not in the long run.
It will tank again, like it always does...  but its new bottom always seems to be higher than its old bottom and then eventually it all happens again.  As long as you aren't putting money in that you need in the short term, then there is everything to gain by being patient.
Unless the whole scaling and fee issue gets too crazy and another coin takes over with better tech.  Which happens to a lot of open source software projects, so it can always happen here.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:30:35

But isn't the "store of value" aspect (in the long term) dependent on the currency being a quality tool for transaction?
I mean..  isn't that the basis of the perceived value of bitcoin?

In one way or another, almost everything you do with money is a "gamble".
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:28:21
I had a 100,000 cruzeiro bill once that I kept in my wallet from 1989 when I was in Brazil. Every several months they'd change the name of the money when they ran out of room for more zeros.  In the year and a half I was there, it went from cruzeiros to cruzeiros novos to cruzados to cruzados novos and back to cruzeiros right before we moved.
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:23:37
Short term, yes.  Long term my main motivation is to mitigate the federal reserve and related banking system.
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:52:15
Pretty vague.  What is meant by "large" and "cash transactions"?   Is this just a reference to bitcoin cash transactions or are you referring to something else?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:31:25
Perhaps.  Depends how you mean it.  ;]
It is a gamble whether you will feel like you got your money's worth.  It is a gamble of whether or not someone working there could help themselves to your credit card info.  It is a gamble of whether or not you'll get food poisoning.
Of course all of this is highly unlikely.  My only point is that there is risk involved in everything.  Fortunately varying amounts, so that we can make educated decisions on how best to deal with it.

I expect USD is being used a fair amount there.  I recall when I lived in Brazil in 1990, when they were having the same infaltionary problem, people would always love to take USD if the opportunity was there.

@_date: 2019-05-13 16:39:53
No, but the seller is certainly entitled to charge differently or add extra charges however they see fit.  Much like some businesses will charge a 3% or greater surcharge for credit card transactions.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:21:34
I certainly agree.  Just saying that I can't morally fault a person for adding a charge to offset their added costs to use a particular payment vehicle the same as they do for credit card charges.  It is a fairly common business practice.
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:29:52
That has already been happening.  A few years ago it coincided with problems in Argentina.  Not saying that was THE cause of that "bubble"... just one of many causes.
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:19:46
More of the same, I would presume.  But we won't know the details till it actually happens.  There is always the possibility that other crypto-currencies fill the void if/when that happens.
