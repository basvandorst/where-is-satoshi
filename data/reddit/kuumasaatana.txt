How is it capitalism's fault though? Percentage gains are going to work the same way no matter the "system".

I think all those problems you mentioned about purely capitalistic pov's are only related to the US.

About 10 minutes it seems.

What happens to the roads after they're constructed by a private company?

See I was after the point you made about the people using the roads having to pay more.. It's only going to make it worse for those poor people who have to use a private road to get to their 9-5. Not to mention, there's nothing stopping the road owners from raising the price or even adding extra fees for "over using the road".
I would honestly be stoked to see how a country with no taxes and everything privatized would work on a large scale so that one part of the community doesn't end up fucking it up for the rest of the community.
 I live in Finland, by the way, so my life is basically socialism by your standards I'd assume. The thing I like is that I pay 25% of my salary to the government, and then I pay 25% of the taxed salary as VAT for everything I buy, yet I still feel I'm winning here, since I know that every year my city's road infrastructure; cycling lanes, public "rentable" bicycles, public transport, you name it gets improved on a very, very visible scale. The change I see every single year is amazing and it blows my mind how much the people using my money get done wrt making my life easier in the city and country I live in.

Would it be more or less than what the amount of money from taxes goes to roadwork?
