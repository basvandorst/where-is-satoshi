Same thing happened to me a while back - it was fixed by using mobile qr code to log into web wallet :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:31:43
Very well :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:14:56
True, can they do it in the correct order? I dont think so :) 
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:19:02
Then use 12 word phrase - if that doesn’t help, contact their support
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:12:54

@_date: 2017-12-05 18:29:20

Guys, NiceHash was not “hacked” this was a great exit scam perfomed by the owners!

All of these comments are wrong, what you should do is buy gold with bitcoin and then sell the gold :) 
The above mentioned company is Slovenian based company  and its selling gold for BTC since 2014 - they are partnered up with bistamp. 
I have used them and cashed out my btc and paid 0% on income or capital tax - i did how ever pay the sellers fee which was around 1-2%.

Yeah...I dont think you want to deal with police for a 50baht meal which is 2$ ��
@_date: 2018-08-20 08:04:13
They’ve been in business of selling gold since 1993, if you find this company sketchy nothing is stoping you from hiring a lawyer in Slovenia and instructing him to contact the company on your behalf and selling it through him. 
Of course the fee will rise appropriately and you are looking at minimum 10% fee for the lawyer. 
Law firm I recommend: 
One of the founders is president of UEFA: 
There, that should clear your doubts! 
Bitstamp statemend regarding btc for gold: 
Edit: found official link from Bitstamp offering gold for btc from the company Moro.

Interesting, I was not aware of that - I do not own any but I am heavily invested in Cardano :) thank you for the input.
@_date: 2019-03-13 13:40:05
Can anyone explain to me why is Vitalik included?
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:24:15
this is so sketchy, if you bought the gold bar at a bank it probably has "good delivery" status which means you can sell it anywhere in the world at the current market price minus the sellers fee which is around 1.25% and most certainly not 15%. Ruining/destroying the plastic does not reduce the value of the gold.

Change POW to POS and its solved :)

How can you patent something that you didnt invent? I believe only Satoshi can patent blockchain technology!
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:12:39
Surprised EA isnt using crypto for micro transactions ahhaha
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:54:33
Do you remember how much btc you had in there?
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:26:33
this is just the beginning, i have a feeling we might be 50k by the new year.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:58:53
Thats a very good argument and I agree with you!
@_date: 2019-12-21 14:51:38
by far the best wallet is Exodus crypto wallet. Been using them for several years and never had any issues.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:51:46
Sure, would have done the exact same thing I did with Stellar - sell it and buy ada :)
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:25:25
yeah, but they gave me 25 bucks so they bought my loyalty haha for a while at least :)
