The first of everything was unusable before it was ready. Bitcoin isn't ready yet. 
I just said that we will raise the blocksize at some point. You're using the 'easy get-out' solution, though. It is a temporary fix. Hence why the devs aren't doing it.

I made a post recently about hysteria. I spent two weeks away from this sub and felt so much better for it. When you read about this every day, you start believing that everybody is thinking the same.
What I realised is that people aren't. Most people aren't fretting about the fees. They just buy and check the price every now and again. Because most holders aren't moving their BTC, they don't care about the fees for now. That's why we can wait. People don't need it as a currency yet. They are happy holding.
I think there is a point at which we push the panic button, but it's probably when the price is less than $5k.

Correct. That’s not to say that won’t be changed in the future to allow unbalanced channels, or that it has, or is being, already implemented without my knowledge.

But it isn't, though, is it. We can wait. You're getting your knickers in a twist. 
SegWit isn't stagnating. No exchanges, wallets etc are removing SegWit. They are adding it, though. So, while the SW transaction % is currently lower (it was the highest it's been about 3-4 weeks ago), it will improve over the next year.
What you are seeing is the new people getting into BTC that are using exchanges that don't have SW yet. That will change.

@_date: 2018-01-23 12:21:47
A bit pedantic. 
You know exactly what I meant.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:52:06
What Satoshi originally planned is kind of irrelevant. The idea is that BTC is de-centralised and has no leader. So ultimately, it's what the community think that matters. 
The arguments are pretty much this:
For blocksize raise: It will immediately clear the mempool of transaction backlog. BTC will be a cheap and usable currency again.
Against blocksize raise: While everything above is acknowledged as true, it would increase centralisation. The large the blocksize the harder it is for the average person to download the blockchain and 'verify' Bitcoin. That leads to centralisation if it gets large enough.
While it is commonly understood that at some point in the near future (within a few years) the blocksize will need to increase, there is a push to look into other options first as reversing the blocksize increase will be very difficult. Also, the pressure from high transaction fees is great for development. If you're a dev highly invested in BTC you're more likely to do extra work on it if BTC is under pressure. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:30:48
No need for the negativity. 
When you got into Bitcoin, you should have known it was unfinished technology. Even satoshi said that. If you didn’t, that’s your fault for not doing research. 
Updates are coming that will improve this, but they don’t happen overnight. In the mean time, just don’t move BTC much.

They won't. Because there isn't a better one yet.

@_date: 2018-01-20 09:51:11
Not a shill, but you’re unrealistic and impatient. You got into this tech knowing that it was incomplete. We all knew that it wasn’t scalable as it was originally designed.
People today want things NOW NOW NOW. Nobody is saying the fees aren’t a problem. But they’re being fixed. It’s not an overnight fix and it was never promised to be.
If you expected a quick fix, then you;
1. Don’t understand the complexity of the technology.
2. Don’t understand coding.
3. Don’t understand Bitcoin.

Just don’t tell them. I get the same reaction from the Mrs and my mum. 
If BTC is part of a diversified portfolio, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with it. If you’re all in on BTC just prepare yourself in case it dies and everyone says I told you so. 
Whatever the outcome, not telling anyone is for the best. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:21:29


You can't compare BTC and another crypto to a Focus and Model T. There are too many criteria both are judged on. 
If you think another crypto is better than BTC, then invest in that. None have cracked scaling yet, though.

A blocksize increase isn’t a good solution. Here’s why.
Yes, it would remove the congestion. But it also increases centralisation. That is because every node has to download the block chain, constantly. The larger each block, the more data has to be downloaded. A bitcoin node has to be possible for the average person.
As the blocksize increases it becomes more and more difficult for the average person to keep up. That centralises Bitcoin. 
Bcash have done this already. The bitcoin devs didn’t like it and neither did majority of the community. While a jump to 2 or 4mb wouldn’t increase centralisation by much, it sets a precedent for a future of easy decisions instead of correct decisions. 
We don’t need a fast fix, we need a right fix. 
Let’s exhaust all other options before increasing the blocksize.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:47:06

You just countered your own argument. I cannot run a node that size on my laptop. That just cut me, my whole family and most of my friends out. 
Bitcoin won't die in if we spend the next two years looking for and implementing a better solution. We all know that the blocksize will eventually increase, but the pressure from fees is a good thing to push updates like Schnorr, SegWit adoption and Lightning. I'm all for a blocksize increase, just not yet. It will become people's go to fix. If we moved to 4mb, what would you do when it clogs again? The same thing...
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:48:52
Absolutely. Any crypto can be upgraded unless the coding has been locked. 
It does require consensus, though. That can often be more difficult than the coding. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:43:10
Ah, an easy mistake to make, my friend.
You’re mixing up lightning testnet with Bitcoin Cash’s scaling solutions.
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:49:19

It's crucial we don't start hype that it can be used while there are still imperfections.

When you run a node, you download the block chain. The larger the block, the bigger the download. That makes it harder for the average person to run a node on their PC. 
Nodes ‘check’ the block chain for cheating. That is decentralisation. We need as many nodes as possible. Raising the block size just makes this harder.
The fact that the comment above mine has 10 upvotes for a move to 8mb shows how few people understand this. If that’s how you feel, sell your BTC and move to BCH. That’s why they split.

However, to open a channel, you must add the same funds on each end of the channel (user 1 (you) and user 2 (them)). If you use your funds, you can still receive a payment, even though your end of the channel is empty. You obviously cannot send a payment, though.

Not doing it really only serves to make the rich ever richer over time. It leaves enough to allow incentive for high earning jobs/ventures but spreads the wealth better to those live close to their country’s poverty line.
It’s important to remember that everyone is affected in their earnings by luck (intelligence, nurture environment, timing, health, looks), so rebalancing that luck through tax is a fair way of ensuring everyone lives as happily as possible, while still providing incentive for top earners to fight those jobs/ventures.

To run a node, you need to download the block chain. Simply, the larger the blocks, the tougher it is to download the block chain. The easier it is, the more an every day person can do it and the more decentralised BTC is. 
While 2mb blocks are likely fine, it’s a move in the wrong direction. Block size increases should be a last resort.

I don't see it because it isn't there. Your article doesn't justify anything.
If you mean politics in the original sense of the word, 'to make decisions for a group, then yes there is politics. And that is the democracy of Bitcoin, it is an essential part of it.

Correct. 
Take an average PC at £500, it will likely have 1TB of storage. That is enough that most people won't get an external hard drive.
So, where do you expect the average person to have 1TB free to use? *You* may be a computer geek that carries a lot more storage space but I don't know anyone that has more than 2TBs. There really isn't much need for any more for the average person.

My whole point is why that isn’t a problem. There are many scenarios where a more oligopolic environment is beneficial for the users.
Like with my supermarket example. Having large players in a market can very often be good. I don’t know anybody that thinks a few very competitive supermarket chains is a bad thing. They provide good products, competitive prices and large range.
Obviously, a portion of that doesn’t apply to the LN, but the general point remains.

We don't need help right now. BTC is about even for the last month and way up over the last 3 months. While the fees are inconvenient, they aren't killing BTC. Everyone can wait.

I don’t misunderstand at all, I think you do. If Bitcoin is the future then it will spend more time deflationary than inflationary, hence my comment. 
I’m far from gullible about inflation. I live in a stable democracy that has to answer if they are outside a 1% swing from a 2% target inflation. If you don’t trust the people in charge of your money, like government and banks, then the issue is your democracy, not the currency. 
Taking the money out of the control of the people in charge of everything else does not fix the real problem.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:12:30
Completely agree.
If you are being taxed that much, though, and you aren’t seeing a return (I.e. free healthcare, schooling, roads) then your problem is with the governments policies and not tax.
Tax is a solution, it just needs to be allocated correctly. 
America spends a much higher % on healthcare than the U.K. and canada. Yet America doesn’t have free healthcare and the other two do. That speaks volumes on how funds are allocated.

Most countries currencies aren’t arbitrarily inflated either so it’s not an issue for a stable democracy.

If you think bitcoin will remove the need for debt, then you are mistaken bud.
Banks will still be necessary, for a couple of reasons. The most important is loans. People here will talk about P2P loans, but that would require the sharing of financial information and likely a third party that organised and recovers assets when payments aren’t made, they would then take a cut, meaning that banks can once again undercut on loan rates.
The second is security and insurance. In a bank, my money is secure from hackers, if I get hacked, the bank legally must replace my money. With Bitcoin, my full balance is at risk. Again, some people on here will say if you don’t protect it, it’s your own fault. Well that kind of attitude is bad for Bitcoin. Most people will take the security banks offer.

If people are payed in Bitcoin, why would they not have funds already on their channel?
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:34:24
At the minute, every transaction gets processed individually by miners. This can create a blockage.
The Lightning Network (LN) is a series of channels. If I want to pay you, I open a channel with you. We can leave this channel open. So I send you 1 BTC, then you send me 0.5 BTC and the channel counts the balance and only sends the final 'transaction' to the miners when we choose to close the channel. 
What makes the LN so effective is if I want to send money to your mother, for whatever reason...  I don't have to have an open channel with her. I can send it via you if you have one open. This is how the network is created.
Minimal transaction fees, if any, and a clog free currency.

@_date: 2017-12-11 17:29:54
I imagine we'll be past 30k before ETFs anyway. 
I think LN will come before ETFs and that should drive the price.

De-centralisation is a potential worry because companies can open hubs and start charging to run through them. The devs don't seem to see this as a big worry though, so it may not be.

You're over-complicating it. With today's currency, prices gradually increase with inflation. Bitcoin is deflationary, so prices would gradually fall.

This is the lightning network. It works on top of Bitcoin's mainframe. It allows me to set up a channel with you and transfer coins. However, the transaction doesn't get sent to the blockchain until we close the channel. That means we can carry on moving money forwards and backwards, without a fee and instantly. If I don't have a channel open with you, I can send payment via Barry, who we both know. This is where the network part comes in.
The link above shows the demo in action.

Added, thanks for that.

The best way to tackle this is by raising awareness. Every upvote counts. Let’s get posts about SegWit and who does and doesn’t use it to the top. Let’s put pressure on them. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:44:53
Not sure what side you’re on from your comment. The impatience is driving me insane, though. 
People think developing tech like this is fast. These devs will likely have it done in less than 2 years total (next 6 months). There’s not enough respect for the job they’ve done. It’s quite frankly incredible. If the LN is successful and Bitcoin explodes, these guys will have revolutionised world currency.

LN is expected in the next 6 months. 
I wouldn't say they missed an opportunity, BCH is fundamentally flawed because its solution is temporary.
Bitcoin isn't my coin, neither is BCH. I do, however, own both. I believe BTC is the future but I'm happy for whichever coin is best to triumph. Atm I think BCH is on the wrong path though. 
Maybe I'll be proved wrong, maybe not. The atmosphere is toxic in both subs about each other. If I want unbiased information, I don't search for it here.

Sorry, I missed your question about why. A lot of people suspect that Wall Street traders have got involved and that they'll sell off in mass amounts.

Crypto can't solve poverty. That's not what it is for. In fact, if crypto swapped with FIAT, the 1% would be even richer. Bitcoin also can't help people that don't have internet access. 
Spreading wealth through democracy can and does solve poverty. That is where they must start. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:14:28
It really depends. Bitcoin is overflowing right now with demand, so transactions are backlogging. 
A solution (lightning network) is on the way, but for the moment transactions will be tough and expensive. Be patient. Wait until the price madness has calmed a little if you can. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:22:06

@_date: 2017-12-06 18:36:59
Seems reasonable. Transaction fees need to come down for it to work and the volatility will obviously work itself out over time. 
Hopefully they get involved again when Bitcoin is ready.

Sorry, I was talking about Coinbase implementing LN.
LN itself, I think within 6 months. Hopefully closer to 2-3 months.
Edit: This is pure speculation btw, after seeing the testing they've done.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:48:23
Maybe initially. Do you see how complicated the internet is? 
No. User interaction and interface can change everything. There is demand for this, so it will be supplied.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:08:15
Bitcoin isn't like the stock market. We can't accurately predict it 10 years from now, so working out how much you will make is silly.
We *can* roughly work out its ceiling price. It's probably between $2-$10 million per coin if it achieves mass use (greater than 50%).
Obviously the closer we get to full penetration (that's what she said) the more the dollar gets squeezed, to the point where people wouldn't even accept a billion for a Bitcoin. So that 2-10 figure is in today's values.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:46:45

This is the answer.
If you place a market order and the market shifts rapidly as you do it, then you may miss the price you saw.
It works both ways though, you can gain sometimes.

An update in signatures. Schnorr signatures. 
Mostly it helps prevent spam. Multiple transactions get grouped and processed together. Shouldn’t be on reddit so can’t link. Google it and there’s a good article near the top. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:13:20
It depends on the speed of deflation really. 
My main reason was that Schnorr is a better solution. 
Not a bad idea though, I thought it was possibility at first.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:32:56
Come January 1st when Coinbase holders are issued their BCash........ just watch BCash plunge...
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:26:10
I have thought about this. There are definitely problems with the idea.
The best current solution is Schnorr Signatures.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:32:35
This logic doesn't make sense.
Lightning should increase usage of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:29:56
But is deflation in an inflationary currency the same thing? I'm sure I read somewhere an argument that it isn't the same and can't be compared. Not an expert though.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:08:09
This thread is the perfect example. It's being tagged for removal because it asks how the two coins are different. Like you say, the propaganda is shocking. 
Nobody tries to justify BTC, they just expect people to believe BCH is bad. Tbf to r/btc, they justify their position better than most in this sub.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:28:05
Yeah, they haven't opened BCH &gt; BTC yet.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:49:54
Why did you invest at $9k? Do the same justifications apply?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:42:38
Oh, I'm not arguing Bitcoin will hit a million, just that you're talking shite.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:06:25
So what if it crashes. If LN is successful, we start using it as a currency again. Word will slowly spread about easy it is to use and it'll come back. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:24:36
If you have a significant amount then you're certainly risking a lot. 
I like Bitcoin but if I had all my money in it I'd be sweating.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:40:10
No need to be like that. 
I pulled the 1T number from a billion people in Bitcoin (obv if Bitcoin is successful, not now). That's with each person having only $1,000. I don't know if Bitcoin will get that big, nobody does, but it's an example for Bitcoin scaling.
My previous comment clearly states why there will be comfortably more than 2 hubs, more likely hundreds or thousands. That will mean competition.
Why would you only open one channel? Fees will have dropped as LN activates and blocksize increases. I would expect sub $5 fees. $5 per channel is absolutely fine for months of activity. That counters your 'large centralised channel' point.
As for the article, I read it a while ago, got disheartened. Then I asked questions on here about specific parts of it. I can't remember the individual points, I'd recommend trying to find solutions to the problems it mentions, but they cleared it all up for me. If you have a specific part of the article you find concerning, I will try to find the same evidence I found to counter it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:35:22
Bigger blocks are still necessary. The LN paper states that they will still need a blocksize increase in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:09:46
They are so biased, as is this sub, that I have to do my own research. Imagine that in this day and age.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:03:01
Nobody cares.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:59:59
It depends what you want from it. Personally, I'm never trading my coins back to FIAT.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:56:55
For scenario 2, I believe the best way would be to charge a high enough fee that people either, do not route through you, or you cover your costs for moving back to your preferred channel.
The fees will be almost zero anyway, it may not even be a concern at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:33:41
The community seems pretty split on this. Maybe it is better to wait until more people are involved. 
What we should definitely be doing is advertising that you can buy parts of 1 coin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:13:52
But if a billion people have money in Bitcoin, banks won't have that money...
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:39:35
If your strategy was 100% solid, daytraders would be using it everywhere. 
It's just not that simple.
Edit: Many people missed prices while they waited for a dip. For some people it worked, for some it didn't. You cannot say it's better to wait for a dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:20:37
This is part of the reason that I’m thinking about holding. By the time I get mine out it will have crashed.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:55:44
You replied to the wrong guy.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:00:38
The current fees force a solution. It should help put pressure on the LN. 
Scaling the block size now, may lessen that pressure. IMO I think it’s better for BTC that fees stay high for now.
Even if BTC crashes, with LN tech it will bounce back. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:09:36
I'd post this as its own thread so you get a bit more exposure.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:32:16
That’s not a reason to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:21:08
A rushed LN could have a disastrous effect  on Bitcoin. 
It has to be right when it gets released. Let’s increase blocksize for now. LN does not get rushed. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:45:14
I thought they said they weren't interested in doing that?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:51:08
I disagree. If you believe in the technology, buy. If you don't, sell or stay away.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:38:29
We know the fees are high, they’re being fixed. 
Be patient and don’t move small amounts. If you can’t afford to have your money stuck in BTC, then you should never have invested in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:13:38

In terms of Bitcoin max value if full adoption happens, I tried to calculate it. 
I estimated somewhere between $3-10 million per Bitcoin in today's money. That's with it replacing every single currency. 
Quite a wide range, I know.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:30:23
This is a kneejerk reaction.
Adding a few mbs of data makes a huge difference to the de-centralisation. Have you noticed that the devs haven't kneejerked? That's because they know we don't need to. The solution is to stop the spamming of the mempool, because, even at 4mb it can still be spammed. Schnorr signatures is a solution that is on the way.
We have to pick the right solution, not a temporary one. Schnorr and SegWit enforcement are enough to keep fees low until LN is released. But they aren't the easy fix, so people choose block size.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:30:44
Wait until it doubles then withdraw your $5 and still get to a million. EZ money.

@_date: 2017-12-24 00:34:27
If you're sending BTC to a random wallet(s), you will be sending some to dead wallets. This further adds to deflation of BTC. 
You remove a lot of incentive from the miners. Why would they bother if they receive very little reward outside of the block reward.
I'm sure there are more that I thought of at the time. There are better hypothesized solutions to this problem, Schnorr being the best.

A lot of your purchase risks are not really risks. 
Either you live in a country with a dictatorship, or you're over-worrying.
The long term risks are valid.
Worldwide Adoption - not a problem
Cost of transaction - LN will fix this
Difficult to think in cents - I don't use cents in my currency, so this wont be an issue for most people
Ease of theft - People will be encouraged to spread coins across multiple accounts and I imagine companies will start that insure your coins, like banks do now, whilst the loan them out to people. This has to continue, or the housing market will collapse.
Taxes - Can be enforced. Companies state how much has been paid to each employee and show reports. Tax man comes knocking, or takes it from pay like the current system.
Anonymity - Not sure how this is a problem.

No difference really. My point is that they won't hold the currency. They will do the same as now, where they invest it to get larger returns. Bitcoin won't deflate fast enough that people no longer use stocks to increase wealth.

I don't believe that is how it works. Not an expert but I'm sure the transactions are limited per block. Not per miner.

Are you sure it's not just slippage?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:24:28
Yes, you’re right. A regulated exchange is a treat. 
It prevents price manipulation. At current, you can place a big order to scare the market and cancel before it’s approved. In a regulated market that is illegal. Just as it should be. Trading is not a game of poker.

A company would have to store a significant amount of capital to control a very large hub. The return on these funds would not be large, so they would be better using that money elsewhere. Remember companies don't want to dick you for the sake of it, they want to make money. Dicking you just happens to coincide a lot of the time.
Having numerous hubs is fine, healthy competition and no monopoly. That is de-centralisation.
As for the argument about stealing your balance, he forgets to mention that if they try, you can take everything from them instead. Why would someone risk trying to steal? Especially if these channels can provide an alert, which I'm sure they could easily code in. Try to steal mine please.

This is just one problem you've mentioned and it's not a problem I have seen anywhere else, so I'm not sure how credible it is.

No, taxes only apply when you sell.

Sorry, I meant from a 'cash out this channel' and 'load into this channel' perspective. Is it just as long as two Blockchain transactions (one to close, one to open) or does it require an action from the other party on both the closing and opening of each channel?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:12:48
When 'channels' are closed, they get sent to the blockchain. That's when the miners still make money. 
Anyway, the coins aren't all mined for another 100 years or so, that is a problem for another day.

Your claim then is that Bitcoin is overvalued. 
Your comparison to a new car company is incredibly naive because Bitcoin is the first of its kind, nobody knows how it will go. There is no previous comparison to value it from. Not to mention, Bitcoin didn't start one day ago. 
If you think its price is too high then sell or don't buy. Everyone gets their own opinion. If you're trying to convince people here that it's not worth it then you'll be in for a tough time.
Majority of us believe in the technology. It's not all in place right now, but when it is I don't think Bitcoin can be stopped. Instant micro transactions with micro fees. I'm happy to buy more BTC at $20k, $50k, $100k because I think it's worth more.

Unlike SegWit which offers a small benefit, LN will be implemented quickly as those not using it will fall behind.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:15:12
Right now you could do it with less than a trillion, but it would still take a lot. But you tell me why someone would do it? There is minimal financial gain.
Increasing the blocksize is part of the LN strategy, it's in the whitepaper.
LN is working on the idea of BTC becoming a major currency. If you want to send all your BTC to an exchange, closing a few channels is hardly a big inconvenience and will very little (4 channels would be $20). Not a dealbreaker for LN.
Why does the number of hops it take matter at all?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:05:11
"If we only have one signature per transaction, more transactions will fit into blocks and a spammer would need to send far more transactions in competition with more people, and thus likely spend more money to take up the same transaction space. Signatures are often the largest individual part of a transaction, so the attacker would be disadvantaged.
If the attacker chooses not to use Schnorr signatures and continues to use old signatures, then other users that do use Schnorr will still have smaller transactions to send and will thus have to pay less. This would still make an attack more expensive than before."
This is from the linked article above. Have a read of the article, it's quite interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:28:32
8 years is not a long time frame. Especially considering people didn't realise how badly it needed a scaling solution until more recently.
How long do *you* think it takes to design and script something like the LN? It needs to be flawless when it's released. It can't be debugged on the go, or people lose money. 
Have some respect for the people who are far smarter than you that are working on this.

I think this is because of the lightning network news. That news is huge for Bitcoin. Once the LN is ready, there is no stopping Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin will be a better way to pay for goods, to pay our friends or families and a better currency for countries to use going forwards. 
For me, that's why the price has rocketed. I think it deserves to be there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:32:57
Why would they put that much into a network that has such small returns for them? Companies don't centralise because they want to dick people, it's because they want to make money. The two just happen to run hand-in-hand right now.
A HUB that charges too much will get cut out. It's inefficient to have so much locked up in a HUB that has such a small return when they can spend that trillion elsewhere.

Because block size increasing isn’t the scaling solution. 
Imagine the whole world uses Bitcoin, and imagine we use it for micro transactions (that is the intention). Block sizes would need to increase by a magnitude of 6-8, maybe more. We’d be looking at a terabyte sized block at minimum. 
An off-chain transaction is the only scaling solution. The LN is the solution to this. 
This isn’t to say blocks won’t increase, they probably will, but they aren’t the answer by themselves. Within the next 6 months we’ll probably see the start of the LN being implemented. Bitcoin will survive perfectly fine until then because none of its competitors have a scaling solution coming any faster.

Naturally people are scared to short it. It's a volatile market that has been projecting up rapidly. It takes a brave person to short that.
Even if you do believe Bitcoin will fall, the rewards versus the risk are tough to justify. You have to be very convinced that it will fall to justify those kinds of risks.

How are the devs responsible for lack of SegWit use? They created the tech, they can't force people to use it.

@_date: 2017-12-06 09:39:27
Exactly this. There will be Bitcoin banks. I'm quite happy with a company holding my BTC securely and insured against hacks, in return they can loan it out to people who want to buy a house or start up a company.
Edit: I feel like a lot of this bank hatred comes from Americans. When I lived there my bank charged me if I didn't have my wages go directly in. I.e. there was a fee if I didn't give them more money every month, how absurd is that. I can see why they hate them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:43:46
You need to look at the technology and work out its value. Personally with the LN, I think BTC is still undervalued.

So that is how they reload their channel without sending the tx to the blockchain. This looks like a challenging balancing act for the HUBs.

The LN works off chain. That means minimal transaction fees. The only fees incurred are:
- Opening and closing a channel, 1 on chain transaction for each (channel can be left open for a long time, potentially months)
- Small fee for routing your LN payment through a HUB (amount will be miniscule)
LN is not the only solution, increasing block size is still a consideration, but the LN will bring down on-chain transaction fees substantially as well.

We are talking about intentional deflation, hence the ‘positive’ spin on Bitcoin . Not price fluctuations, that happens to any currency. 
Bitcoin is made to reach a point where it deflates, I.e supply slowly dries up. 
The others quoting deflation definitions are talking about any kind of deflation, which clearly wasn’t the point of this post, or else bitcoin would be a calamity.

These answers are fucking terrible. 
This person wants to know the difference and all you get is ‘shitcoin’ and ‘don’t bother’.
Bitcoin Cash raised the block cap from 1mb to 8mb. This allows more transactions through each block. It puts them in a position Bitcoin used to be in, where transactions are cheap. However, it doesn’t solve the problem, they’ll just have to fix it again if they grow their user base. The larger the cap, the easier it is for an entity to control the currency, this is why most of Bitcoin didn’t agree with the cap increase. 
Bitcoin is currently less useful than Bitcoin Cash as a currency due to high fees, that will change if the lightning network is successful. This is why more people believe in Bitcoin than Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin is taking its time to find the right solution to the problem, patience is key to success.

If you charge high fees, you'll get cut out of the market. 


If your channel is due to be closed, it would make sense to have a second. You can have access to more of the network, just incase your first channel doesn't have a route. You can then become a route and can take a small fee if you want.


This doesn't make sense. If there isn't a route available, there are no hops because there is no transaction. You open a channel that does have a route. As the network usage increases it becomes more likely one channel will access everywhere. If there are lots of hops, there is a route. No issue there. 


If a channel is unresponsive it is avoided on route.

Coinbase is just an exchange.
The LN isn't centralised. It uses HUBs, yes, but a HUB will be avoided if it is too expensive, slow or untrustworthy. Due to capital restrictions, it will be impossible for one company to dominate the HUBs. Each channel requires a balance. No one company, or even 100 companies, will be in a position to fund 7 billion people's channels. They can't afford to lock up that much.

$0.10 transactions mean transacting $0.10, not a 10 cent fee. There will be almost no fee.

If small nodes all connect to each other then they may not have issues. I think we really have to wait and see how it plays out.


Ah, I see. Yes, it becomes more unlikely. We aren't expecting full de-centralisation though, just healthy competition between hubs. No monopoly. 


This has been solved. There is no risk at all that it doesn't get passed down. They used a clever algorithm that prevents the middle man taking it until they have passed it on. It's complicated but it works fantastically well. Watch this video for it. The good stuff starts just before 3 minutes.

This is where banks will have to come in for some people to trust Bitcoin. The insurance is important. Especially for a currency where people will hold larger sums because it won’t inflate. Also, loans still need to happen.

You can, but imagine the average person has $1,000 loaded in a channel with a hub. Each transaction incurs a fee, currently devs expect this to be less than 1 cent per transaction. If a person did 10 transactions a day at 1 cent, that would make the HUB $36.50 a year on there $1k. That's a reasonable return of 3.65%. But if they get that much, many people will open HUBs because they will outperform their savings accounts with zero risk. The zero risk will encourage many people to create their own HUBs. That will drive the fees much lower and the return lower. 
A company would have to accept a return of (likely) less than 1% per year on the funds in their HUB. That's not good enough when they can loan that out to someone for much more than that or invest it.


The network searches for an open route through. How many hops that takes is irrelevant to whether the route is successful.


Correct. If a channel or HUB is unavailable (due to insufficient funds to route your payment) it will be ignored. 
No doubt there are more issues that will arise as LN develops, but the devs have tackled some of the most challenging issues already. The solution to make it a trustless system is brilliant by itself. That prevents B stealing money from A and saying they gave it to C. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:24:35
Currently Bcash is more tradable that BTC. Hopefully that will change when the LN is available.

With regards to your other questions,
Denominations is not a problem. Smaller denominations are already being used. Bits, Millibits and Satoshis (Sats) are the most common. We can let the communities decide what to call them. 
Banks insure money right now. In the U.S. your money is safe against fraud for up to $250k. In return, they loan your money out.
No you can't enforce it, but if they are willing to go to prison for not paying then that's up to them. 
Anonymity, yes to a certain extent it will make it harder, but the police have other ways of tracking. It is a small problem, but not too troubling.

Value is not always about now. In fact, it is far more often about the future. 
Value to people is reflected in price. Not that the value is in it's price. It may be less valuable than $18k to you, that's fine. But based on every human, that is its value on average.

It’s a nice thought, but it’s bollocks really. 
First you have to ignore the chunk of the world that have a better banking system than America. Banks that actually provide a service, rather than charging for anything and everything.
Next you assume banks won’t still be critical to finance. They will still provide loans/mortgages. If people aren’t banking with them, they’ll raise interest rates until people do again.
In most countries, money banked is secured by the government up to hundreds of thousands. A BTC account isn’t, a mistake and it could all be gone. I wouldn’t laugh at that kind of security. 
So, in short, banks will always provide a financial service. They will adapt. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:26:08
For me, this is why we will need a 'bank-like' company involved. 
They store your coins securely and insured against fraud. In return they loan them out. Loans still need to happen for lots of reasons, mostly for housing.
We just have to make wise choices on these Bitcoin banks. The funds have to be instantly transferred when we withdraw to our wallets/channels (LN). None of this waiting for transfers, or charges for little things. 
I don't know if it would be too difficult to create a people's bank, where we are in charge. Like Bitcoin.

My bank is very beneficial to me. If they opened a Bitcoin deposit option, I'd hold my Bitcoin there. The problem is with the way American banks operate, not with banks in general.

Yes, and no. If too much demand comes too soon, BTC looks bad. People won’t care that it can change, they’ll just say it doesn’t work.

You also have to download the entire history of the blockchain, so petabytes or more.

As long as that 20% isn’t because they can evade tax, it’s great for BTC. If BTC becomes a tax dodge it’ll get a lot of negative press.

By cheating, I mean controlling the network and changing it to how they want it. There's nothing you can do if they have majority. Follow it, or let the currency die. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:49:08
Crypto is missing a couple of key things. Security is one. If my account gets hacked, I lose everything. My bank has to legally replace it, but with BTC, it is just gone. 
The second is lending. Loans from multiple people through smart contracts aren’t simple. Your financial history has to be disclosed. You may have companies that set up peer to peer loans, and they view the history and mark your risk accordingly. But a bank would be more efficient at it and would be able to offer a cheaper mortgage. 
Plus, you’re forgetting one thing. Banks in my continent are great. They treat us well, and don’t fuck us over. I like my bank. I once had £2k stolen from my account, they returned it without me even knowing. I saw t on a statement a month later. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 22:49:28
They aren’t empty words in my country. If they are in yours then I’d be starting a revolution. 
I don’t need to read more about Bitcoin. It sounds like you live in a corrupt country. I’m sorry to hear that. The problem is not banks. It’s how free your banks are to do what they please. It doesn’t mean banks are bad, it means your banks are bad. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:16:58
Don't assume a currency that can't inflate is better. We don't have any evidence that it is. While inflation is perfect, we can't assume that no inflation, or deflation, is better. There is a chance it reduces spending and affects economic growth.
Also, most people don't care that the currency inflates. I don't, it doesn't affect me. My country is stable enough that it isn't a worry.
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:16:10


That is true of some governments. The American government is an example. If my government could improve things by deflating, they surely would. It is far more democratic here. I have lived in America too.
If those people stay away from Bitcoin, Bitcoin will not go global. If you're okay with that then that's up to you and what you want out of Bitcoin. That's what it's about. I believe it can go global, but it has to adapt slightly (not give up its values) to appeal to a larger audience. Decentralisation and deflation don't matter to me (although I understand why decentralisation matters to Americans), but I see value in instant transactions peer to peer and the removal of merchant fees that will help small companies.
@_date: 2018-05-04 19:01:00
That's what your country is spending tax on, not mine.
@_date: 2018-05-09 21:48:12
So, firstly, poor is subjective. There will always be someone 'poor' in society. The poverty line in the UK and France (almost certainly Germany too) is higher than the US. A higher poverty line is a leftist ideology. You guys like the American dream, so that's why you have so many Billionaires. The cost of that is a lower poverty line. A greater divide between top and bottom.
The second article you linked showed a 'poor' woman earning 10.51 per hour. In dollars that is $12.46 per hour. That's not so bad at all. Naturally we don't know cost of living there, so your article really doesn't prove a point either way. Someone earning $40k in London would struggle to live alone and would definitely struggle to support children. So that is all specific to the individual. 
France and the UK are far more left wing than the US, but I think Germany even more so from speaking to Germans. We get more German news than you do there. The Germans are driving the world forwards. Merkel is definitely the most influential woman in the world right now, maybe influential person.

Of course banks make money, they have to. Your points are redundant, however, without analysing profit margin.

The money goes from my possession to another person's possession. It is as simple as that, regardless of which third party is involved. The contents of that account is legally considered mine, therefore I am transacting my money to another person. That is peer to peer. Just like a bank. The money in my bank account is mine, not the bank's.
Whether you like that system of peer to peer is not really relevant, but it is peer to peer.
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:15:16
Lightning is instant.
You’re just off track with the decentralisation thing. Just because Bitcoin needs it to function doesn’t mean I care about it. PayPal has peer to peer, that isn’t decentralised. So Bitcoin doesn’t *have* to be decentralised to offer peer to peer. 
While I know Bitcoin needs to be decentralised, at least right now, it is of no benefit to me when I have a stable FIAT that is run by a stable democratic government. 
Another thing you’re missing, is I like Bitcoin because of future tech, not current. If Bitcoin stopped developing today, I’d sell immediately. It’s the development of lightning and how the lightning apps will function that FIAT cannot do.
@_date: 2018-05-17 20:52:33
I've seen it. The principles of Bitcoin Cash are ridiculous. It just cannot function if it were to go global. The data required to run a node would be too much for the average person, so it isn't decentralised.

He isn’t. But fortunately, this sub isn’t either so everyone can live in a nice dreamland together. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 21:14:55
Nodes check to make sure people aren't 'cheating'. If an individual or conglomerate run enough nodes, they can control Bitcoin. That is why it is imperative that the average person can run a node.
This is why Bitcoin Cash is so unpopular. Raising the blocksize has a drastic effect on decentralisation further down the line.

Reduced spending means a reduction in jobs. You cannot predict that deflation will be better. Very few people are qualified to make that prediction. You and I are none of those people. If financial experts knew it was better, that's what governments would be doing. I'm not saying it isn't better, I'm saying you, nor I, are qualified to say so.
Sadly, what other people care about is important to you. It is if you care about Bitcoin's success anyway. If you're pitching BTC to people because of a factor you love, but they don't, you won't get anywhere. Most people don't care about decentralisation or deflation. What they may care about is instant transactions, a universal currency and almost free peer to peer payments.
If Bitcoin is to be successful it can't be niche. Deflation isn't important to the average person.

It's quite simple economics. If you compare right wing countries to left wing, you'll find there is significantly less poverty in the left wing countries. Distribution of wealth reduces poverty. How else do you re-distribute other than tax? There isn't another fair way.
While tax isn't 'fair' to everyone, the majority benefit from it. If you earn less than say $100k a year, you definitely benefit from the tax system during your life. If we had a vote to remove tax, you'd be lucky to get 5% of people to vote to remove it.

We should start by downvoting memes. At least the shit or repetitive ones.

I agree with your first sentence. Your second one is nonsense, though. Like with stocks, as it grows it will become more stable. 
I do disagree massively with posts like this, though. Using an appallingly run country as grounds for why BTC is better, is foolish. Why would my friends and family care about that point? They don’t. Inflation doesn’t matter to them because they live in a stable country.
Also, we have no evidence that deflation, or a stale currency, is better. In fact, we have evidence that suggest that deflation reduces spending and caps the economy.
I believe deflation can work, but to say it is better than the current system is naive. We have no evidence to confirm that. Just because the current system has flaws doesn’t mean another way is by default better.

Increasing block size will eventually lead to too much data on the blockchain. Then the average person won’t be able to download it and the currency is no longer decentralised. Then they have to be made even bigger if it goes global. I believe the calculation I saw was over a terabyte per block if bitcoin was used globally for everything. Absurd.
@_date: 2018-05-04 20:53:48
My country.
I just explained, using America's healthcare system, why it can't be privatised. Our system is much better. We spend less on healthcare than Americans in tax and get it for free. If everyone pays for their own, the price for the average person would be too high and you'd end up with poverty in places, like America. The more privatised sectors you add, the worse the poverty becomes.

I know someone that has. I saw the comment before he was banned.
@_date: 2018-05-19 22:32:29
I just explained why. 
Instant peer to peer transactions is the main thing. A universal currency would be nice too and it’s time everything went electronic. For a universal currency, decentralisation is important, however. So badly run countries or corrupt countries can’t fuck it up. But it wouldn’t affect me now, and therefore it’s not a benefit.
Free payments for merchants will reduce everyday costs slightly. 
I believe FIAT can do most of things I find important. However, I believe Bitcoin can do those things sooner, as well as a few things FIAT can’t/won’t do. 
I don’t have to love Bitcoin. I just need to prefer it the current system.

That’s not true at all. You’re trying to pay for dollar priced items in bitcoin and call it the same thing.
The difference there is the exchange rate. I believe bitcoin has actually inflated by about the same amount (arguably more if you had removed all the previously lost coins at the start). 
If you paid dollars in Venezuela over the last five years you could say the dollar has gone that way too.
@_date: 2019-03-03 10:54:34

Bitcoin hasn’t been a good store of value. It’s value has plummeted multiple times. That is the opposite of a good store of value. 
I’m not saying gold is the best, I’m saying it’s better. But almost everything is better because bitcoin is far too volatile.
Say your going to buy a house in a few months and you need to maintain your value so you have your deposit. What are you going to pick as your store of value? It’ll be FIAT, it certainly won’t be bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-24 12:51:37
If an investment is a net positive return the longer it is invested, the more you make. Do you really need me to run the numbers for you?
By cost averaging, you mitigate some of the risk (volatility) at the cost of some of the returns (you aren’t invested for as long). It’s quite simple really. 
Personally, I think your post is silly anyway. You say the price is low, well it’s low compared to the ATH, but it could be very high compared to where it’s heading. Yet more shit content in this sub.
@_date: 2019-11-13 00:53:04
You can’t really disagree. It’s a fact. Volatility does mean it’s a poor store of value. It means there’s a risk you won’t get back what you have put in. Therefore your value may not be stored.
I know this sub isn’t the best representation of bitcoin, but I didn’t really expect so many people to try to argue that bitcoin was a good store of value when it is so clearly not.
@_date: 2019-11-12 10:00:41
Sorry I mistyped. You don’t get positive volatility without negative volatility. By definition that is what volatility means.

@_date: 2019-11-12 14:15:28
I agree they lose value, and that is why there are arguably more stable options. Bitcoin is not one of them.
There is a very real chance that bitcoin drops to nothing. That could happen if people don’t take up crypto, or a better crypto currency becomes popular. 
So how is bitcoin a good long term store of value if it could drop to next to nothing in 10 years? 
It isn’t. It’s a risky investment that could make up a portion of a balanced portfolio. It is not a store of value. Not yet anyway.
@_date: 2019-11-18 13:31:31
You fall prey to a simple psychological weakness of people... 
That just because something turned out well that it was therefore the right decision. 
So, yes, in hindsight bitcoin stored value well, and increased. But at every point along the way, and currently, it is not a good store of value because we cannot predict the future and past results cannot guarantee future performance.
If you honestly think you are right, post on the personal finance sub. If you can get support then I’ll admit I’m wrong.

I wouldn’t say the dollar is the best store of value, but it’s far better than bitcoin. The dollar has never dropped 50%+ in a year. Bitcoin has done that more than once. 
You’re confidence in bitcoin is naive. If you think bitcoin can only go up you’re mistaken. 
In my country FIAT can’t be seized without extremely good reason. Bitcoin can also be taxed. If you aren’t paying taxes then you are breaking the law. 
Your arguments sound like you’re part of a cult. I like bitcoin, I think it has potential. But fuck me... it’s not a store of value! Go and ask the personal finance sub if they think it’s a store of value.

At no point in the last decade would bitcoin have been recommended for storing value. 
If you went to personal finance sub and said I have 100k that I need to store for 6 months - 5 years, what should I do with it? Bitcoin would have been and would be the answer 0% of the time.

There, you’ve admitted it. Bitcoin is currently volatile.
I never said it can’t be a store of value, only that it isn’t now.
@_date: 2019-11-13 01:06:57
I thought we were having a reasonable discussion until this. Fuck me. I take it you have no financial qualifications? If you do, give them back. 
Firstly, dollars are protected in a bank account. I don’t know about the exact amount in the US, but mine is at least 100k if not 250k that it is insured to by the government. I believe that is per bank account. Now give over with that it can be stolen/seized bollocks. It can’t. Your money is safe. 
You sound like one of them loons from the American shows about preparing for the apocalypse.
@_date: 2019-11-11 20:42:24
It isn’t subjective though in this question. Storing value is about preserving value with as little risk of change as possible. It is not about increasing or decreasing value.
You could argue about whether X currency is a good store of value, or whether gold is, that would be subjective. However, Bitcoin is definitely not a good store of value. It is far too volatile.

This is some tin foil hat theory. 
Your dollars are protected in bank accounts for up to $250k. I haven’t lived there for a few years but I believe that is the case. 
Also, if you think bitcoin won’t have bitcoin banks in the future, you don’t understand finance. Banks are essential to the finance industry, for loans, mortgages and protection of funds. 
Before you say peer to peer loans, I’ll stop you. Who would most people rather loan to, a company that by law has to protect your data (GDPR), or random people who can see all your private financials?
If someone hacks my bank, my bank returns the money. It has happened to me before. The bank returned it before I noticed it was missing. 
If someone hacks my bitcoin, it’s gone without any possibility of return. You may say protect your account then... but the average person would rather have the security of a bank. 
Take your tin foil hat off mate, it makes you look silly.
@_date: 2019-11-24 01:53:23
It’s because controlling the currency is part of controlling the economy. It’s natural to want more control over an outcome.
While not without flaws, the current system works, so why risk changing it? The risks could be a global financial collapse. 
They’ll only change when they are forced to.
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:05:52
I see your point. It is flawed though. It is based on the assumption that bitcoin will not fall. It is a very realistic possibility that bitcoin drops to a worthless value. 
That risk is what prevents it being a long term store of value. Short term is prevented due to the volatility.
@_date: 2019-11-12 17:17:30
I’m invested in bitcoin, I’m not debating its potential.

The fees are merchant side, but I get the point. I just think it’s rich to slag VISA, when Bitcoin isn’t ready for mass use. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 10:36:08
That’s not how it works. If you like in the US, Canada, UK, most of Europe etc, your chances are comfortably less than 1%. War torn countries offer a far higher chance and obviously people already experiencing it. 
Hyper inflation is not realistic in stable countries. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:17:38
I think it’s sad that one of the biggest selling points of Bitcoin on this sub is that Venezuela’s currency is failing. It isn’t realistic for most countries.
Can’t we focus on Bitcoins better attributes? 
@_date: 2018-06-10 15:50:36
It’s not one bank, it’s many banks. There is not distrust at all. The bank is lawfully required to protect my money. 
Many banks here offer money if you move to them, decent interest rates and more, because the competition is much better than countries like America. I was born in France, live in the U.K. now and have lived in the US. I get why people here hate US banks, they are shit. 
But just because the U.K. has shit pizza, doesn’t mean pizza is shit. Just because America can’t do fair banking, doesn’t mean banking is shit. My bank protects my money, offers interest for keeping it with them and offered me interest free loans during uni when I was broke. All so I’ll be their customer and they can loan out my money. Seems like a pretty great trade off for both parties. 
I use Bitcoin, it just isn’t as good as my bank right now. My money isn’t protected against theft. If I fuck up, my whole wallet is gone. My bank protects me against that. They have to legally.

@_date: 2018-06-01 17:46:38
Expensive is subjective, yes. But we’re talking about a global currency, so it’s fair to take the global average of what is expensive. I would say that majority of people would say the Bitcoin transaction fees over winter were more than just expensive. They made it impossible to use as a method of payment for most people. 
How the high fees came about is irrelevant. I don’t see you look for excuses for VISA.

Banks aren't bad. They're actually essential to finance, and will be for Bitcoin. Just because your country can't do banks right, doesn't mean they are all shit.

@_date: 2018-06-01 23:51:13
They make money from loans, mortgages and actual overdraft fees etc. They just know the more customers they have the more money they make. So they compete heavily. 
I am very pro Bitcoin, but if a Bitcoin bank opens in my country. I’ll be straight there. Especially if my current bank opens Bitcoin accounts. My biggest issue with BTC right now, is if I screw up and get hacked, everything is gone. When I got hacked in FIAT, my bank put it back without me even noticing. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 16:56:34
I knew this sub would have this straight up here.
At the minute, I'll take VISA's one day down for some people, versus the many Bitcoin 'down' days over winter where transactions were ridiculously expensive.
I love Bitcoin. But when people come with shit like this, and 'look at Venezuela's currency', it just looks silly. Maybe we should wait until Bitcoin is a reliable currency/payment method before trying to slag others.

This does require the Bitcoin community accepting banking.
I’ve said it before, but banking is not the problem. The people in charge of the banks (mostly US) are the problem. Other countries have far fairer banks that actually reward customers for their business. 
Banks can and will work with Bitcoin. They need to for Bitcoin to be a success.

And what would you say are the repercussions as it carries on growing?
@_date: 2018-06-03 14:03:33
Sure. Bitcoin isn’t ready yet to take on the big payment processors like VISA. 
Bitcoin has a second layer that is being developed, called the lightning network (LN). Lightning will allow instant transactions with almost zero fees. They can be peer to peer and will have a very easy interface. It will be like contactless payments, but will allow peer to peer and online shopping too and much higher payment limits.
Imagine you owe your friend £10. They select the amount, you scan the barcode on their phone screen and hit confirm. Transaction done. 
This tech should be ready within the next year or two. You can trial it now, although if you aren’t very tech savvy it may be a bit complex.

While I agree Bitcoin is useful for Venezuelans; it’s like saying flour is useful for cakes.

@_date: 2018-06-01 17:44:21
Well, this is the only time it has been down that I can remember. It hasn’t affected me. 
Bitcoin has far more shortcomings than VISA right now. So if you don’t want to look like a tin foil hat wearing loony, I wouldn’t compare the two until the gap has closed. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 10:55:10
Jesus Christ. This is why I don’t send my friends and family to this sub to learn about Bitcoin. How does shit like this get upvoted?
Inflation isn’t a tax. It’s a way of stimulating growth. It encourages spending, instead of saving. That encourages reduced unemployment. Minimum wage increases with inflation, as do other things. If it doesn’t, your country needs to work on that. 
The problem isn’t with inflation. Inflation managed correctly is fantastic for GDP growth. But if you buy a Ferrari and don’t service it to the point it breaks down after a couple of years, whose fault is it? The Ferrari’s, or yours? 
While inflation isn’t perfect, we have no evidence that no inflation is better. Judging by the quality, or lack there of, of your post, you aren’t qualified to speak about whether inflation is better, or not, for society. I work in finance and I’m not qualified to give an opinion on it either. It’s a very complex topic.
It’s this kind of ridiculous thinking that will put the average person off Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-06-08 23:59:06

I didn’t ignore them. I listed the primary reasons. Of course there are other things that have led to this, but the three listed in my comment are the primary drivers of hyperinflation. 
What you say is debatable though. I’m not saying you are wrong, but there are arguments that Venezuelan leadership have been denying there is even a problem for a long time. They’ve hardly been shouting that the US are holding them hostage effectively.

Another one of these. The tin foil hats are out again. 
If we’re going to persuade people that Bitcoin is the future, it’s not by saying hyperinflation is a problem that needs solving. 90%+ of people are unaffected by it and likely never will be. Stop looking and acting crazy. It will put people off.
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:25:39
Then your country, and others that do the same, need to sort out their banks, so they don’t charge you fuck loads for moving money about.

Not lucky, or rich. It’s free for everyone in my country. I also had interest free overdraft of about $2k converted, while I was a student. That is completely normal, too. Everyone I knew had interest free overdrafts. They didn’t start charging interest until 2 years after graduation either. 
It’s one thing I always add when people bring up banks in this sub. Banks aren’t bastards. American banks are bastards. They just need to be controlled better.

@_date: 2018-06-03 14:08:04
Governments can ban whatever they want. Whether it is in their interest to, is another matter. 
I don’t see any immediate threat to Bitcoin from major governments. There are a couple of things that may trigger considering a ban. 
- if bitcoin is difficult to tax
- if it is difficult to police, such as checking accounts of criminal activity and recovering funds used in criminal activity. Like money laundering
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:09:47
Right, so fees can be artificially inflated. That can’t happen with VISA, unless they change fundamentally. In which case, they’d lose customers.

Where did I say their lives don’t matter? I said Bitcoin is useful for them. So fuck you for trying to play that card.
But if you come to my country and try to pitch that Bitcoin prevents hyperinflation, we’ll tell you to take your tinfoil hat off. Inflation isn’t an issue here, and isn’t in most leading countries. 
This sub focuses on inflation and banking so hard and they forget a lot of the world don’t have an issue with either. So why would people be interested. Bitcoin has some fantastic uses, but constantly pitching stuff about Venezuela just doesn’t help Bitcoin be taken seriously. 
I would never send anyone to this sub to learn about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:12:45
Visa’s tech is outdated? 
The payments process immediately, so I don’t have to wait for confirmation. I get rewards for using their credit cards. And they have contactless payments in most of their cards. Not sure how it is outdated.
I accept that Bitcoin *may*, in the future, offer better tech. But to say VISA is outdated, would suggest Bitcoin is prehistoric. VISA is so far ahead of Bitcoin right now. 
@_date: 2019-08-11 11:43:31
This is incredibly unlikely to happen in the US. 
The problem has been caused by 2 or 3 avoidable events.
The first was socialist policies brought about too quickly by their late prime minister, that cost the country more than it could afford. This led to very high debt. Venezuela is not in a position to not pay that debt. The US is different, it’s an economic, political and physical powerhouse (I’m not American) and despite having high debt, it is manageable. 
The second was Venezuela’s dependence on oil. Over the last few years the price of oil has dropped significantly, and that with no real reserves due to their debt, Venezuela was impacted massively by the drop in price. The US is not as dependent on oil and has not suffered in the same way. They are far more diversified. 
The final, and potentially most important reason, is that the Venezuelan leadership is not doing anything to resolve this. They have recently suggested changes, but financial analysts are incredibly sceptical about their likelihood of succeeding. The US is much more likely to resolve the problem than bury their heads in the sand. 
In short, this won’t happen to the US. If it did, the effect on the global economy would be catastrophic. Other countries wouldn’t let it happen. Deals would be made to fix the debt, and actions would be taken quickly to prevent the inflation growing. 
You can all rest easy.

Not sure who you’re talking about. Visa was working for most people. 
I’ve said this a few times today. You’re trying to slag a system that works, when yours isn’t ready to go global yet. You’ll seem like a tin foil hat man. Just wait until Bitcoin is ready before slagging the system that is currently better.

Point is, it’s a silly topic.
Inflation is very well controlled in almost all democratic countries. Inflation encourages spending, which provides economic growth.
Deflation isn’t necessarily bad, but it’s unproven. Attacking inflation is just silly, because for most countries, it works.

It has a small impact. But the housing crisis has been caused by the buy to let demand. Inflation is not the cause.
@_date: 2019-06-10 18:58:08
How does that argue against my point?
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:12:04
Well, it’s like water is good for you, unless you drink too much, then you die. So your argument is a bit silly there.
Inflation is good for economies, it helps manage growth. Central banks have inflation targets, mostly between 1-3%. Any more or less and they have some explaining to do. There is a very good reason that inflation isnt kept below 1%, and that is because it stimulates growth. Otherwise people wouldn’t spend /invest their money. They’d just hold on to it.
@_date: 2019-02-25 09:58:04
You’re being deliberately misleading. That’s why I corrected actual inflation figures. 
The US increasing their reserve without releasing into the system doesn’t affect anyone. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:00:13
Not true. I work in Finance, so I’ll try to explain how it works.
If the value of your asset (money, pound, dollar etc) is decreasing, you are less likely to save. This encourages spending, which promotes business growth, which encourages employment. 
There has to be a balance, though. Too much inflation can cause chaos, so it should only be used to boost the economy when it is struggling.
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:39:22
I’m not trying to compare because they shouldn’t be compared. One is the actual inflation that affects consumers and one is far less relevant.

He made no points at all. He tried to undermine inflation by saying “add more bits of paper” but makes no point about the effects on an economy.

@_date: 2019-02-10 10:41:45
I’m not missing the point at all. I’m explaining why constantly posting at inflation in Venezuela is silly in this sub. There is no evidence that deflation is better, and inflation is fine in majority of countries. You seem to be taking my point in the wrong direction. 


I would take issue with this. This is simply not true. Most currencies don’t crash completely when the market value goes down a little. The pound has dropped significantly in the last 3 years, yet inflation is still very low. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:42:46
I will add that if you don't sell, then you never need to pay taxes on the gains.

The first three didn’t say much. The last one was so against inflation that it gave no benefits, which you can then use to disregard it as a reasonable source. 
The points it makes can be countered quite simply by stating if a person loses value in their savings, they are more likely to spend them. This grows businesses and the economy. 
Deflation would do the opposite. People would be encouraged to hold money, which reduces business growth, reduces jobs and negatively affects the economy. 
There is a reason why countries don’t use deflation. Inflation helps them control economic growth better.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:46:28
You'd think so. That 4% could be considerably more difficult to finish, though. Let's keep our fingers crossed. 
@_date: 2019-12-01 15:13:37
Because you can’t really be your own bank. In a bank my money is insured against theft and fraud, in my bitcoin wallet it isn’t. As soon as banks start insuring bitcoin, people will move to them. The process of banking may change slightly, but when the banks adapt, people will use them.
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:27:37
I need insurance against someone hacking my account. Nothing to do with inflation. 
Bitcoin currently does not provide that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:55:03
Anything can bubble. A bubble is just a hype train that takes a value above what it really is worth. When the first few start selling, the panic begins and more sell. The asset will drop quickly.
Bitcoin could be bubbling and drop quickly to below $5k, or it could carry on growing. It's only worth what people will pay for it. Nobody knows for sure. Long term is far more predictable than short term.

In your country you may think that. In mine we disagree. We like equality. No need to be insulting.
If it can't be regulated correctly, it will be banned and that ban would be supported by the people here. I love Bitcoin, but if regulation in certain regulatory aspects don't happen, it won't work and sadly, I would also support the ban.

That’s called realising a loss. And when it goes back to $15k you owe just as much tax as before. 
Also, don’t know why you’re going BTC &gt; alt &gt; BTC. Trading to fiat and back would have the same useless effect. 
How dumb am I? Learn a bit about tax, my friend. 
Edit: To add more detail, if you bought at 15k, then sold at 6k. You have a loss. It is goes back to 15k, you have a gain which can offset taxwise with the loss. Instead, you can hold back to 15k and then sell, you have no gains and owe no tax.

No, mate. I’m not naive. My country and most of my continent have incredibly secure banks. Legislation dictates that. America is the same.
While you may not like banks, your money is safer in there than in a BTC wallet because it is guaranteed by the government. In a BTC wallet someone can steal the money from me, even if that’s at gunpoint. In a bank, that money would be returned to me.

You’re offsetting a gain that you don’t have if you just don’t sell. If you ride it back up to 15k you still don’t owe any tax.

Anyone that says no is either lying or deluded. Everything has downsides. Whether they are big or small is usually subjective. 
Bitcoin is deflationary. We don’t have any evidence of a currency that works like this. We have no evidence that it can work. I believe it can, but I don’t have the financial experience to argue the case well.
It is safe, so safe that upon my death none of my family can get it. That’s a flaw of decentralisation. Whether it needs to be fixed is another question. Removing inheritance from society may not be an issue if nobody receives it. 
Potential hacking. At the minute it is impossible. Or at least seems it, but that could change if we don’t adapt to new technology quickly. 
It has to be taxable and easily traceable. Everybody wants freedom and anonymity, but we all enjoy the security that body checks and scanners give us at airports. As much as I hate the saying, you can’t have your cake and eat it, you get one or the other, anonymity or security.

Check the definitions bud. 
Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context.
A currency (from Middle English: curraunt, "in circulation", from Latin: currens, -entis), in the most specific use of the word, refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins.
Nothing to do with governments.

Absolutely. Your computer does so many complicated things to access the internet and run programs. You don’t see these because they are hidden behind a user-friendly interface. The same will happen with LN.

This part doesn’t add up. If BTC has gone from 6k to 15k, that’s not a 10% gain.

If you’re talking about the richest 1%, then there’ll be a new 1%. Possibly even richer than before for the original Bitcoiners.

You’re stating the obvious a bit. Credit cards work with any currency, yes we know that.

If I open a channel with you for 1btc, we both put 1btc into a secure location on the blockchain. The 2btc are held there until we close it.
If we transact on the LN in the meantime the balance is not sent to the blockchain, hence it’s an IOU until it’s sent! A bank note is an IOU. LN is entirely IOUs until the channel is closed. 
Why are you trying to be pedantic while I’m trying to help someone understand?

An open ledger with no names on attached. It’s anonymous. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:37:54
That does not add up. 
If you buy alts for 6k and then buy back to BTC that has gone up to 15k, you only buy 0.4 BTC with your alts 6k sell. 
You are assuming a positive change in the alt price vs BTC!! To get 1.1 BTC, you would need BTC to go from 6k to 15k value while alt goes from 6k to 16.5k in the same time. 
Edit: I see what you’re trying to do, but it’s:
1. Misleading
2. Costs trading fees.
3. Doesn’t actually save you any tax in the long run
4. Can make you fall in the short term capital gains tax which will cost you more

The banks spend money on protecting your data. They have to by law.
Also, if the private sector is securing your money, then it isn’t fully secure. A company can go bust. That is what the government secure against.

The richer the richer get, the poorer the poorer get.
The reason America's poverty line is lower than the U.K. is because their rich have more money. Now if that is what America wants, then cool. Each country gets to make their own choice. In Britain, we don't want the rich to get even richer.

I absolutely do. 
This is different anyway. For me to throw 200k to someone for a mortgage, I would need to know their financial situation and history, like a bank.
Except a bank has spent money on making sure that information is protected. I don’t know anyone that would do this loan shark style mortgage.

@_date: 2018-02-19 08:40:18
It’s not necessarily a good thing. For example, if Bitcoin goes global, satoshi (who we assume doesn’t have access to his coins for whatever reason), would be a trillionaire. 
While, bitcoin solves a few financial problems, it could create huge inequality and we need a way to pull those funds from the richest people.
Nobody needs a billion, never mind a trillion. How we do that, I don’t know. But it is a potentially huge problem. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:56:03
You don’t make a tax gain! You have to pay the tax in the long run! 
So, 0.5% cost to postpone the taxes... most people would rather spend the 10 minutes it takes to offset losses the following year than do that.
You won’t offset the additional tax from moving into a short term gain. It *will* cost you more in the long run. 
There is no financial gain long term from what you are suggesting, just a slightly easier tax return and lower tax for this year, at the cost of a larger tax amount for another year. This is what I’ve been trying to explain from the start. 
Edit: not to mention if you happen to make a gain in the 2 minutes you’re in the alt, you have yet another trade to declare.
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:18:19
They do actually state that they hold them. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:53:28
There is a risk in that. We have no evidence that a deflationary currency can work. We also have no evidence that it can’t. Therefore, we are assuming that an inflationary currency is bad. 
For large amount I’d rather not be my own bank. My bank is secured by the government. My bitcoin wallet isn’t. Someone can hack me or I can make a mistake and lose everything. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:51:05
You're asking the wrong people.
It won't change the price globally. Croatia is a small crypto market.
Check the legislation that they are passing. Is it illegal to buy? Can you hold what you already have?

I can give an example of badly built cars, that doesn’t mean all cars are badly built, or, that the car itself is bad. 
The problem is the democracy, or lack thereof, not currency. Political discussions on this sub are pointless. Majority of people on here are American and some take their dissatisfaction with their government as a given that others should feel the same about theirs.
Giving extreme examples is not helpful to debating because it draws incredibly unlikely scenarios. 
My original point is that lightning is an IOU because it isn’t settled on chain but stored separately. IOUs can be trustless. It is just one person owing the other, Lightning holds and calculates this debt without anyone needing to be involved. People just aren’t used to trustless IOUs so they freak out.

@_date: 2018-02-07 14:29:12
Ah, now I understand where you’re going wrong with your thinking.
Trading to an alt is tax-legally the same as trading back to FIAT. You can’t hide in crypto to avoid tax.
When you sell BTC &gt; alt, you owe tax on BTC. When you sell back, you owe tax on the alt. 
Trading to the alt and back is indentical legally to trading to FIAT and back.

If you think people will stop spending because the currency is very slowly deflating, you are completing ignoring patience and desire.
Most people have little patience for financial growth and strong desire for possessions. How many people do you know that are investing well for their future vs buying their new merc? Deflation won’t change spending that much at all. 
People can make roughly a 10% return now by leaving their money in a fund. They don’t because most people would rather spend.

There will still be lots of finance jobs in investments and banking.
People thinking BTC will remove banks, it won’t. It may revolutionise them.

Loans - so I can start a business or buy a house

I’m telling you, mate, you’re wrong on this. Post it to r/personalfinance and you’ll see. 
To buy 1.1 BTC at 15k, the alt would have to rise by 10% more than BTC did. 
This isn’t avoiding tax. It’s hoping that one investment will do better than the other.
You’ll still owe taxes on the alt, though. So, again, the tax will be exactly the same!
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:42:24
The idea with Bitcoin is that it’s decentralised. 
That means democratic decisions through popularity. Not one person ruling our decision making.

UK here. I’ve lived in the US, though.
Ours were bad for fucking people through mortgages, like in the US but nowhere near as bad. That has since tightened up. We get better interest rates, no account fees, no transfer fees etc. I was amazed that the banks in the US charge me if I don’t give them more money every month. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:46:34
Your maths is off, I’ll try to break it down. I’ll use easy numbers to make the point.
Buy - BTC @ 10k
Sell - BTC @ 5k (this creates a 5k loss which can offset future gains)
Buy - ALT @ X value for 5k
*assumption that BTC and ALT rise at the same rate*
Sell - ALT @ X value for 10k (this creates a 5k gain, offset by the previous loss, no tax owed)
Buy - BTC @ 10k
And we’re back to the start but with unnecessary trades in the middle. If this is spread over multiple fiscal years then it requires more complicated taxing.

I would disagree with your final point. I think BTC does need to improve wallet safety. While you and I may feel comfortable with the security of our wallets. Majority of people I know prefer the security that bank gives. I.e. if you get hacked the bank is legally responsible for returning your funds.
If BTC doesn't match that, it will struggle to be successful. That's without even mentioning inheriting BTC.

Complete U-turn on this then. Your funds are only as safe as Robinhood is. I wouldn't recommend investing in BTC through them until they allow withdrawals.

I'm not a thief, I'm advocating my own wealth being redistributed.
I don't need to debate this with you anyway. Your country likes it your way, mine likes it my way. My point, is, and always was, if people want it to succeed in Europe, it has to be taxable. If you don't want it to succeed here then that's fine. 
But in all honesty, if it can't be taxed in America, it will be banned there too. You're more right wing than the average American I met, and that was mostly in Texas. You aren't alone in your beliefs, but there aren't many people that agree with you.
Explanation for you: People in my continent want tax. It provides public services that are essential, like great healthcare, emergency services, schooling, military etc. If the currency can't be taxed, we don't want it. I think Bitcoin probably can be, but if it can't, it won't succeed here. 
Whether you disagree about tax or not is irrelevant. I'm telling you what we want here, and what will happen if it doesn't fit.
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:09:29
I just said most of my continent. Bitcoin won't succeed here if it can't be regulated correctly. The rich already tax dodge enough, you think we are okay with them doing it more?
Don't forget we are far more left wing in Europe. We believe in greater equality, in this case financially. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:22:49
I see what you’re saying but it wouldn’t work with this. 
With drugs etc, they get more expensive because of the risk of import and scarcity. 
With Bitcoin, it would just be many people leaving the currency because they don’t want to be on the wrong side of the law. The other factors don’t apply.
Let’s hope it doesn’t come to this.
@_date: 2018-02-19 09:52:42
Well, pull in the form of taxing. No one person needs a trillion dollars. Spread the wealth around and everyone lives better. You do this through income tax, capital gains tax, corp tax and mostly, inheritance tax.
If not, Bitcoin will fail. The rich are already too rich in many countries, Bitcoin will multiply that even more.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:51:44

Bitcoin wasn't built to prevent ultra rich. That can only be done through government and taxation. 
My point is that Bitcoin is tougher to monitor and therefore, tougher to tax. Some people on this sub may like that, but Bitcoin won't be successful in Europe if it can't be taxed efficiently. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:12:50

I sympathise with you but you were asking for trouble. Playing with margin is risky business and it is important to have a bankroll management strategy. If your margin goes wrong you only lose 10% for example. 
When the greatest poker player in the world sits down with everything he has got, even he is gambling. 
Traders who use margin, do so to increase volatility. In this market that is really not necessary.

Banks of some form are still essential, for two reasons:
1 - loans will be needed to buy a house or start a business
2 - funds in banks are legally secured by the government up to an amount. If someone hacks you, the bank is obligated to replace the funds. BTC will need a solution to this.

Banks aren’t going to disappear under Bitcoin. They still play an essential role in finance. 
Plus, if you don’t trust investment companies with your money. You’re going to have a shit retirement. 
If you can’t trust your banks and investment firms, you need to work on government legislation. The problem is how they are regulated.

Exactly. It doesn’t matter if it’s a guarantee or not. It just means it is owed. 
On our bank money it says, ‘I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of £X’. That is an IOU in paper form. But it is still guaranteed.

You just linked me to a page that states the UK isn't that corrupt per studies and tries to argue against them.
The UK is nowhere near as corrupt as the US. Not even close. Iraq was a huge turning point for the UK. Citizens here now have little interest in the military. They don't praise soldiers. Tony Blair got torn apart for that decision.
One key difference is the UK has multiple parties. It means that when people become dissatisfied with the two major parties, the others come through and have an impact. More options and less corruption.
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:18:01
If you keep posting about beating banks, that might be why. Let me explain. 
Banks are essential to finance for a couple of reasons:
- Mortgages and loans. Buying houses and starting businesses usually require loans. Peer to peer won’t work without a 3rd party because someone has to look through the loanees financial data to determine their credibility. Plus, the returns wouldn’t be particularly high. 
- Security. Banks are legally required to return funds if they have been fraudulently taken. If I have $250k in my bank account and someone takes it, it’s returned to me. With BTC, it’s gone. Tough luck. You may be fine with that, but most people won’t like that at all.
- Banks aren’t so corrupt outside of America. They are more tightly regulated and have learnt a lot from 2008. For example, my bank offers up to 1% interest, does not charge me to keep my money in there and does not charge me for wiring to another bank. 
You might be able to change the banking system, but you won’t remove it. There is a need for the service they provide. You should be looking at legislation to ensure they do not screw you. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:13:34

The currency is still decentralised. The banks don’t and won’t control it.
No, I haven’t heard of salt coin.
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:46:26
So just an opener, I am big fan of BTC.
However, from an economic stand-point this is misleading. We know that an inflationary currency promotes spending which leads to a growing economy and plenty of work. See how unemployment correlates with austerity. 
What we don’t know yet is whether a stationary currency (or marginally deflationary as BTC will be) will affect that economic growth. Will it affect how often people spend vs save? And how would that affect the economy?
It’s very easy to say that A is better than B because B isn’t perfect. But we have no evidence that A is any better. A deflationary currency may be better, but I hate this argument that it will be. Very few people are qualified to make that judgement and we have little evidence to make the comparison.
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:14:27
Anyone who thinks banks will disappear really doesn’t understand finance. They may change drastically, but a few points:
- we still need loans and mortgages, people say peer to peer but that can’t work unless people are comfortable sharing their financial info with lots of people. 
- banks secure your funds against fraud, that is key for me. I don’t want to fuck up and lose everything in my wallet. As it grows I will get more worried about that. Most people will feel similar and go to a BTC bank.
- The key point, most countries don’t have banks as corrupt and abusive as America.
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:15:47
I agree. I don't think it's ready yet.
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:23:39
Banks are still essential to finance. They provide loans, mortgages and security from fraud. Those things are important to 90%+ of society. 
Also, most here are Americans and rightly hate banks. The rest of the world doesn’t. Banks are more tightly regulated elsewhere and offer better value. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:33:02
I think it’s different for each country. We elect our politician, so they vote for our views in parliament. They have to balance between voting for their party (to stay part of that party) and voting for us (to get re-elected). 
I believe a democracy should dictate. I am strongly against Brexit, but we should leave because the majority voted for it. If I don’t like it, which I don’t, that’s tough. I moan, but it’s fair. I think the same applies for tax. I would argue tax is more moral because it aids the unfortunate (whether that be intelligence, illness or nurture). It’s a robinhood effect, but with luck instead. It takes from the lucky and gives to the unlucky. There are downsides, that people get free rides that don’t deserve it, but it helps enough people that I can get over that. 
Most people would say where we get to in our careers isn’t luck, but most of it is genetic or nurture. From the way you react to this sentence, to the way I write it, it’s 90%+ affected by external events that we have no control over. For that reason, I think it’s fair to level the playing field a little. There should still be a competitive work environment, though. Otherwise that breeds laziness.
I would disagree with your last sentence because it sets a different precedence for crypto. That’s a way to create hatred for it. For it to be successful it has to fit in. Fit in but be better. 
It’s nice to have an open chat about this on this sub. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:57:26
Not really sure what you’re trying to say. 
BTC of course should be taxable, but just like any other currency not separately. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:31:28
I can’t speak for your country but my country did.
In fact, I imagine at our next election, that the party that wants higher taxes will get voted in.
Our country uses taxation to fund many fantastic public services. We love them. So we are fine paying for it. We have free healthcare, great policing, cheap public transport and great maternity and paternity leave.  
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:58:09
It’s getting there. The world is swinging more to left as time goes by. Removing tax havens from world organisations like the EU or NATO would put pressure on them to add Corp tax which would allow other countries to raise theirs. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:01:26
Deflation is yet to proven as good for a currency. There is a strong risk that it reduces spending and damages economic growth. 
We can’t act like it’s a positive for BTC yet. We need evidence that it is better first. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:30:35
Your example is bad as it provides no alternative to the one. If the 9 voted for the 1 to leave, that is fair. That is essentially happens when someone is sent to prison. 
With this, you have an alternative, which is to move to another country. 
Buddy, you are the 1%. Anyway, how in your scenario do you plan to pay for police, military, roads, schools etc?
@_date: 2018-04-23 08:51:07

It’s these posts that put me off this sub. 
I try to convince people around that BTC is great and yet if they were to come to this sub they would see stuff like this actually get upvotes.
Taxation isn’t theft. It has been voted on by billions of people before you and millions currently. It is democratic. If you don’t like it, go to another country. 
If your country isn’t spending its tax efficiently, then that is a different argument.
@_date: 2018-04-23 08:45:33
Not at all. We all know what the price is. 
To help BTC grow, I believe we need to be full of information. People get downvoted for asking simple questions here, but memes and pure threads get upvoted. 
It doesn’t do much to persuade people it’s not just a fad. We should be helping people learn about BTC, even if it means seeing the same questions again and again.

Yes, you can choose how your money is spent, and you choose to live in a country with taxes.

American banks caused it.
This is where some of this sub gets a bit biased without realising it. While other country’s banks weren’t perfect, far from it in some cases. They have learnt from 2008 and don’t fuck people as hard as American banks do. People in my country and a lot of my continent don’t mind banks at all.
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:17:26


You suggested no taxes. That has to be a non-democratic system because democratically we always end up with taxes.
I meant 1% of people want no taxes.
@_date: 2018-04-20 09:12:01
Ah, we’re getting somewhere. So your issue is how those taxes are spent, not the taxes themselves.
My country didn’t spend that to bomb people, we spend less on our military and more on our people. 
Also, it’s a bit disengenous to say they bombed for nothing. They didn’t, they bombed to try and prevent the chemical warfare that has been happening to Syrian citizens. Whether you agree that the US should get involved is a valid argument, but it wasn’t for nothing. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:11:08

You'd end up paying a lot of money for insurance, for police, fire, school etc. Many people wouldn't be able to afford to live, you'd have extreme poverty.
The roads would end up shit because why would anyone pay for them and you'd have an underfunded military.

There's definitely movement in Britain on its democracy. People are becoming irritated with the House of Lords because it isn't democratic. Usually they don't have major input, but they are starting to with Brexit.
This most recent election in the US would have been the best opportunity. People were disillusioned and that's how a non-politician got in. It would have been better if those people voted for a more minor party instead. It shakes up the big parties and makes them think about how much they can get away with in the future.

This inflation definitely gives the richer an opportunity to make a larger margin but that’s purely down to education, not opportunity. My piddly savings matched Warren Buffet last year for % growth. 
It amazes me that this sub is passionate about equality from currency inflation/deflation, but don’t want taxes that distribute currency far more efficiently and with a successful track record, which deflation does not have. 
I will not rule out that deflation can work, it could. But we have no evidence of it yet. The amount of misinformation in this subreddit is alarming. If currency distribution is what you want, tax is the easiest way to get it. If not, then an inflationary currency is fine anyway.

The only people that would want to hide their transactions from say a police investigation, are those that are involved in illegal activity.
If the police want to go through my bank, go ahead. I have nothing to hide, nor am I ashamed of what I buy. 
It’s like the ridiculous law that you guys can refuse a breathalyser, so they do the roadside tests. If you have nothing to hide, it’s not an issue, so everyone should be breathalysed during a stop. The drink driving in the US is horrendous.
