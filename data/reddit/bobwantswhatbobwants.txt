Bitcoiners don't want regulations on bitcoin. If anything, they want regulations on bitcoin companies like coinbase/gdax, etc. Bitcoin cannot be regulated. The only thing government can do is block fiat conversion to crypto via banning exchanges and force companies from not accepting crypto as payment. Bitcoin itself is non-regulate-able. It's out of the bottle. No putting it back in ever again. China banned exchanges. Yet Chinese folks are still using bitcoin--to give you an example how bitcoin cannot be regulated/banned.
The people who are asking for regulation on bitcoin are traditional bankers and old world politicians. They don't understand bitcoin and they feel threatened by it. Obviously bitcoin is an existential threat to them and they want it gone.

I said nothing contradictory to that. Why don't you people get that difficulty doesn't get adjusted after each block. It gets adjusted after 2 weeks or after 2016 blocks since last adjustment. As I sowed with actual block reference that it's possible to generate blocks in less than 10 minutes. Two blocks I referenced were created two minutes apart. With enough hashing power, it second one could have been generated 1 second after the first one. 
I said nothing about security. So you bringing up you need 60 conf for same level of security is a moot point.
 I see people down-voting actual factual things. Bunch of get-rich-quick morons.

Right now, I value 1 btc = $10500. But in future, I hope to give it the value of $1,000,000. The trick is getting you all to agree with me. You all and rest of the world.

You have a lot to learn about blockchain. This isn't an insult but an invitation to to improve yourself and your understanding of the what you want to speak with authority.

Supply of new (USD) money isn't increasing because of printing money. As stated in the link I referenced, total money printed by UST isn't hundreds or thousands of billions. It's was less than 600m for 2014. I couldn't find number for other years. Those 600m aren't all new money. They are also replacing old money. 
The supply of US currency isn't increasing significantly to reduce the the value of USD. That's what bitcoiners and libertarians say. They say US is printing money at will and without bound. And they say that's reducing money's value and causing inflation. They contend bitcoin can't produce more than 10 bitcoin per 10 minutes until the theoretical limit of 21m. 
When we talk about inflation we aren't talking about actual currency. $1 is $1 today, tomorrow, and years from now. Just as 1btc = 1 btc. No matter what. Inflation is buying power of that $1 or $1. Today $1 buys you less than it did last year. Around 3% less. Once bitcoin price stabilizes same will happen. What you can buy with 100 sats will cost 103 sats down the road. But 100 sats will remain 100 sats. 
This is such a self-explanatory and clear subject, I'm almost finding it hard to put it in words. 
For btc to become a viable world currency, I believe it has to be 1btc = $1m usd. Until that or the stabilization phase what you can buy with 1btc today will be far more than what you could buy with 1btc a year before. BTC is still in ascension phase.

Your survey questions are terribly designed and they lead users toward one side. Maybe it's too late to redesign your survey. But you should learn from this. If your paper is public,  link is to it. Would love to bookmark it and never read it.

You understand neither bartering nor how fiat currency gains or loses value. I'll limit my conversation to US dollars. That's where I'm from and in grand scheme to things USD is the only currency that really matters. There's this understanding about bitcoiners and libertarians and even some conspiracy theory nutbags that US just randomly and disproportionately prints money, at will and randomly. And there's this feeling among these same group of people who think they are they only one who realize the problem of printing money without limit even though these people generally have no professionally or academic economic background. Preposterously these group of people think world class economists and statisticians at the employ of US cannot see this. 
US doesn't print new money randomly. Most of the money they print are replacing old money damage money. In 2014, US printed $560m of currency. Even if all of it was new money, it's nothing compared to total USD's GDP. (Not US GDP alone). Printing of money doesn't devalue US dollars significantly. Inflation does. Inflation can still happen to bitcoin and other limit supply currency. It will happen. Bitcoin is not a currency. Yet. Eventually it will. Something you by for 5 satoshi someday will cost 7 satoshi in few months or years. And that's inflation is simplest term. Even though the number of satoshi available will remain constant.

Until difficulty adjustment, it's possible to create blocks much quicker than 10 minutes. There is no 10 minutes time limit. The 10 minute time between blocks is an average. If you have sufficient hashing power,  you can instantly find blocks. 
Go on blockchain.info. You will see last few blocks and the time between them. I checked now. Time between block 511376 (unlocked by 58COIN)  and 511377 (unlocked by BTC.com) is 19 minutes. Not 10 minutes. 
If btc.com has super mega gigantor hashing power, they could have found the block in 2 mines after 58COIN's block.
Time between block 511373 (slushpool) and 511374 (viabtc) is 2 minutes. So what happened to your fucking 10 minutes average rule? 
You know just enough about bitcoin technology to spew bullshit. Why don't you just worry about bitcoin's price and not spread misinformation about bitcoin technology. We have Roger Ver and Co. to do that. We don't need to worry about spreading more crap about it.

It's not bullshit. It tells us big deal about what's going on with the market broadly speaking. Just because it doesn't paint a good picture for you "get-rich-quick" people doesn't mean it's bullshit. 
On topic, 2018 is the

Why should banks limit what I buy? As long as I pay them back at their term? Maybe one at to buy bitcoin, maybe I want to buy a dildo. What does it matter to the bank?

So what if he's Satoshi? Satoshi isn't god or prophet. Bitcoin has surpassed Satoshi. I don't give a fuck about Satoshi. or whitepaper. Bitcoin is what I say bitcoin is. And it has as much value as I give it. I won't kowtow to anyone. But whoever is Satoshi should only get our short gratitude. Nothing else. Nothing more. Nothing less. That said Fuck Satoshi and Satoshi worshipers. You'll are religious fanatics.

Bitcoin isn't faster than credit card. Bitcoin is going to require on average 10 minutes for 1st confirmation. Someday with more powerful computers blocks can be mined much much faster and blocksize can be increased to clear out hundreds of thousands of transaction in each block. For now, bitcoin takes 10 minutes for 1st confirmation.

You are wrong. Bitcoin is my bitch. Deal with it.
