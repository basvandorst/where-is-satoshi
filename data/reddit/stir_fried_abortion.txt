Problem solved!  I'm sure your the bank that holds your mortgage will ignore fiat valuation as well.

You know what old people with lots of money and assets understand and can use easily:  Banks.
You know what they don't care about, can't understand, and have absolutely zero desire to use:  Bitcoin.

Hey fellow retard.  I bet you 10 btc that it will never be $340,000 by 2022.  Mark this too, I'll pay up.

The change isn't occurring because there aren't enough reasons for most people to give a shit.  Bitcoin is still a niche hobby which your average person can easily ignore without consequence or loss of opportunity.
Claiming that anyone is "resisting" the use of bitcoin presumes the opportunity exists in the first place.  It doesn't because bitcoin hasn't managed even a minimal level of integration or usefullness to your average consumer.
Wipe out everyone over 50, and bitcoin still goes nowhere.
It's a plane without a runway.  Or an engine.  Or any fuel to speak of.
