If I had any interest at all in any interaction with robots, I'd rather choose a shooting robot that gets activated when I show any interest. Yeah that's how lazy I am.

It's first time I hear some kind of connection with Gox and Silk Road. Good to know that my 23 BTC are in good hands for our kids' future.

great idea. unfortunately, i've already used it logging into mtgox, so now it won't let me without it. once I reprogram, I won't be able to use it with mtgox I guess.

Turkish bitcoiner here. I really appreciate this and got really excited. 
I wonder how they deal with the legalities where they put these machines. 
The only Turkish exchange (btcturk) has had to start in N. Cyprus. Another one based in Istanbul (koinim) couldn't take off due to regulations.

If you want a simple example, until now we had only one Bittorent client. Now we are starting to see uTorrent, Azureus, Transmission, etc.

I guess that they just keep the encrypted data and whenever you try to access your wallet, decryption and re-encryption occur on your browser (client-side).

You can look for a clue in your debug.log file.
$ tail -f ~/.bitcoin/debug.log (assuming Linux.)
@_date: 2013-02-22 17:14:06
It might go down less than $26 since you can open buy orders as much as you want and some of those multiple orders would run out of funds at $30-$26 range.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:44:54
It seems to me that it will balance at $120 - $130

AES256 is unbreakable as far as I know, at least for quiet some time. If they hack US government or Pentagon, they might get your coins as well.

I'm a Turkish bitcoin user and I buy coins at MtGox periodically using intl. wire from Turkish banks. The thing here is that this amount of any transfer would bring some legal issues along with.

pyramining is legit. I deposited some coins some time ago. But the return rate is quite slow. They are supposed to bring up their own ASICs this month. I would wait for that happen at the moment.
