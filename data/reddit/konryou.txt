Inspect the code once, verify using a hash of the code thereafter?

AFAIK that's not uncommon.

In a perfect world where everyone hashes user passwords this would be great (as long as the universal portion is of sufficient complexity and length to avoid being cracked). But what if one of the websites you register for stores your password as plain text? Your site-specific portion of the password would have to be long enough with enough character types that someone couldn't create a table for universalpassword+possiblecombinationsforsite-specificcharacters and hope to find your password in a reasonable amount of time.

Downloaded the application and purchased a $5 Amazon gift card to test.
To make the purchase you have to select 'Send a gift card' from the sidebar menu and then select yourself from your contacts. The checkout process is pretty quick (and Bitcoin was the payment method by default). The transaction was processed in less than a minute and I received my gift card code a minute or two after receiving confirmation that the transaction went through.

I have myself as a contact in my address book and used that to have the gift code sent to me. You can enter the code into the application but the application doesn't receive the card directly. I anticipate this is something that will change in the future, since it seems like the primary purpose of this part of the application is to send gift cards to people that can't be expected to have or download the application, and obviously there's a pretty large set of Bitcoin users that are going to want to be able to convert their BTC to gift cards for personal use.

In the settings there is an option to have the screen transition go quickly (20s) or slowly (60m). I use the latter and it does take some getting used to it's not nearly as startling as the fast transition.

I responded [above]( just wanted to let you know in case you didn't check back.
