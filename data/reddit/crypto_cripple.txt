Imagine the lifetimes he would have to spend, copying "migs and megs" (or in this case,... "gigs and gegs") of data :D
His hands would bleed as if he were doing a martial arts montage.

this is not a linear chart, but also a nice comparison (though bitcoin was worth only half as much back when they made this chart):

re.: 2) the electromagnetic pulse (EMP, aka. "sun flare") - no:
There is all sorts of military equipment that is shielded by a Faraday cage, and since Bitcoin is decentralized, you'll have a few users with harddisks that are safe from EMPs, who have full clients, i.e. full copies of the entire bitcoin saga since its genesis block.
See [this reddit discussion]( about what happens in EMP events (shit will most likely hit the fan, as others have pointed out).
And see [this guy's post]( describing essentially the Faraday cage solution that the military has adopted for their equipment too.

castorfromtheva was joking that he had copied the blockchain (several gigabytes of data) by hand :)
In contrast, [paper wallet]( does not mean a full copy of the blockchain, it just means you printed your particular private key on a piece of paper or generally a way of accessing a limited number of bitcoins.

It's a trick to check whether the growth is 
exponential (which just means fixed percentage growth over time) 
versus 
super-exponential (which means it's more likely to be a bubble).

imho it's simply not an investment for the common people yet. 
First we need to reach significant market cap, which is a proxy for trust and adoption / ubiquity even. Then volatility should go down as it always does with established securities.
