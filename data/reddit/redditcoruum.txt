Yep, that is what I am gathering and experiencing.


Ya, I am also seeing that.


I am glad that there are people that are willing to take the time to investigate. I have other shit on my plate that is immediately more important, or I would take the time.
I do not believe this "cabal" that is now the "core" group as being completely honest with the community, or even remotely honest. But I could be wrong, it could be either of the other groups (XT or Unlimited) that is full of shit. 
My position is that if LN is so great, let it be great on it's own merits. Don't stifle that which is Bitcoin (now) so as to allow something that is not even BIP'd. Anyways, thank you for your time.

A shame the developer just could not answer the question with a yes/no. If the answer was a "no", then the lengthy and abstract answer may have been warranted. I still don't know if he answered your question.
I am not extremely technical, but I am also not an idiot; when asked a question, and the question can be answered with a yes/no, then it should be answered that way and only after it's been answered should more detail be given. No detail with no answer. 
I have only just entered into commenting on these issues, and one of the things I am seeing is a lack of straight answers; dodging of the questions asked or deflecting by addressing something not even asked. This is what I saw in the reply to your question.

Thanks for that reply. I appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:15:08
There are some states that allow this to occur. Since the tip is the sole property of the tipped employee (excepting tip credit and tip pools of course) it is legal to pass that  transaction fee on to the employee. ONLY the part of the transaction fee for the tip/gratuity, the rest of the transaction fee cost is the employer's.

I asked them for a specific donation address, they provided me with one. I also suggested that they place an address on their donation page so I/we could just donate instead of having to give away personal information. It seems as though they have not made any changes to the ability to just donate though.
Edit: The EFF should make it easier to donate by providing a receive address instead of/in addition to asking donors to provide personal information.

Thanks. Sorry if I came off as confrontational, that was not my intent. I don't expect you to educate me on "Internet Basics", I was just hoping you'd be able to answer the question.
Follow-up question... would using your website, without enabling cookies seriously effect the level of service you would provide? Maybe I am asking the question incorrectly...

Since the tip is the sole property of the tipped employee, only the employee should have (or ever have had) access to the private key. Any other setup is ripe for abuse.

Why yes, I am worried about my privacy, that's why I asked the questions I asked; was that not apparent to you? If it was not apparent I hope the previous sentence helped. 


No... I know what a cookie is. What I don't know is what is collected by each cookie. Do you know what is collected in each cookie you accept? Can you decipher what is in the the cookie file. 


How do I say... bullshit... when I don't really know if it is bullshit? I don't know if you're correct. I also don't think we can agree on a definition of what "pseudoanonymous". But if you're willing to start with what your definition is I'll let you know if I agree with it. Ohh.. and why not just "anonymous"?


Yes, I understand this. **You mean by accepting a cookie that does not specifically tell me what information they are collecting about me "pseudoanonymously".**


I do all of those, thank you.


I apologize that you feel I am being confrontational, that was not my intent. I was simply attempting to ascertain what information their website would attempt to collect from me if I decided to use their service. **I wouldn't go that far, I know enough to ask about this. If I knew nothing about it, then I wouldn't even be able to ask the questions I have asked.**


I do not think it should be either. I was not asking a "basic internet thing" I was asking specifically what information their website collected. I did not ask what information a basic cookie collects, since that would be pointless, I only wanted to know what information their website would collect.
I would wager that if you asked 10 random people (let me be clear... random as in completely random, not random as in  let's pick 10 from the bitcoin subreddit) (ohh and when I say random, I also mean I hope you speak their language because you're not allowed a translator or the ability to download additional applications to help you communicate with that random person, better hope you don't get someone that speaks بلوچی )what information is collected by a random website with their cookies, the majority would not be able to tell you what information is collected. 
Sorry if I seem to be confrontational, it is not my intent.

Thanks for correcting me. I decided to check this though
I took a known address and changed 2 of the characters and searched for this public key on blockchain.info and it returned an "Unrecognized search pattern". What would have happened if I had tried to send an amount of btc to this public address? 
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:21:06
Huh? The point I was attempting to illustrate is that there was an earlier post (Twitter?) stating that the signed book deal was for $5 (not including the price of the book itself), that the website now states it's for $10, but the ToC (mistakenly typed ToS earlier) states the price is $5.
I am in no way trying to diminish what Andreas is doing, at this time, just illustrating the discrepancies.

ehh... This is why I personally tip only in cash. Tipping in cash also has the added benefit of allowing the tipped employee to claim the amount of tips they decide to claim; this allows the tipped employee to somewhat negate any tip pool policy that is unfair/illegal.

Any typo made would constitute a valid public address, since every address is already technically already in existence, it's just not in use yet. I could be wrong though.

Thanks for the information. There is obviously much I don't know about the protocol. I had thought, obviously incorrectly, that the addresses such as "17HRbG1NzixdZeFFcdVdChXCgKFMr7muBV" could be changed slightly and result in a different public address. But that this address is just... easily presentable, easy to understand for most human minds... representation for a more complex item. I'm probably not explaining my thoughts clearly enough... but I think I am understanding more now. Thanks!!

It's got to be a bit rough trying to figure out how you can get paid for the work you've already done and hopefully will continue to do. It's also got to be tough with all the negative feedback you're receiving (and going to continue to receive) with this decision. 
I recently switched from Bitcoin Core and found that there are features of MultiBit I really enjoy (multiple wallets, currency ticker/exchange rate) that are not available in BitCoin Core, and that I don't have to download the entire blockchain. I was also going to donate after a few weeks to make sure I enjoyed the application but now...  I will probably still donate since I've used the application for 12 days, but to pay a tax to use the application? I don't know... it just doesn't feel... right.
Maybe this decision will work and you'll have a large enough pool of core users that will be able to fund the future development of the application. I hope it works, but for me... I'll be looking somewhere else... maybe back to BitCoin Core.

What you are referring to, by law, is not considered a tip. A tip cannot be mandatory or compulsory. Since it is the employer that mandates the tip amount, this amount becomes the property of the employer, Uber. Since this amount is the property of the employer, they employer can do whatever they want with it, including retaining it.
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:08:35


heh... yes and no. IANAL and this issue has legal ramifications and lawyers could argue this on either side. Depending on the courts political leanings or whether one side looked at the court slightly funny, could make this go either way.
**Yes it would be illegal for the employer**, Uber, to institute an automatic service charges, this is what that is considered, and not give it entirely to the employee^1 IF the arrangement between the employer and the employee is that the employee will receive the entire portion of the automatic service charge.
**No, it would not be illegal for the employer**, Uber, to institute an automatic service charges, this is what that is considered, and not give it entirely to the employee^1 IF the arrangement between the employer and the employee is that the employee will not receive the entire portion, or any portion at all, of the automatic service charge.
IF Uber, in their application/TOS, make a claim that the entire automatic service charge (what Uber refer to as the "gratuity") and Uber does not present that entire amount to the employee, then Uber would most likely be in violation of the FLSA and other various local laws.


That is unfortunate. Unfortunately, by law, that "gratuity" was not a gratuity, it was an automatic service charge and your employer's property. Since is was your employer's property they get to decide what they do with it. If you had know the law on this issue you would have been better informed and able to assert your legal rights. That is not saying that you had any legal rights to any of the automatic service charge, but you may have been able to make a case that you were entitled to at least a portion, or all, of it.
^1: I understand that Uber drivers are employees, not Independent Contractors, as Uber tries to claim.

I use Core, Multibit, and the Bitcoin Wallet (android phone), and paper (cold storage); what, if any, ramifications are possible with having my Bitcoin spread between these three different wallets after the hard fork? Any?
Edit: Presumably I'd be able to migrate my keys from either Multibit to Core, or vice versa, or from Bitcoin Wallet to either of those wallets. In case one, or more, of the wallets I use end up on the losing fork. I would then just need to be able to export from one wallet format to another wallet format?

~~I do not believe it to be coinbase,~~ since the email address I used to register there has not received this scam message. The email dress i us to register on LocalBitCoins is the recipient of this scam message. But I've also used that email address, where this scam email was delivered to, to register at at least 3 other websites that are tangentially associated with bitcoins.

As an employee that relies on tips to earn a living wage, I think this idea horrible. I find it horrible because I think you lack an understanding on why someone should tip an employee. Tech support jobs are not minimum, or sub minimum, wage positions. They are not providing you with a personalized service.
That being said, if you decide to tip, that's your affair, I just personally think it reduces and trivializes what a tip is for.

As a delivery driver that is already invested in Bitcoin, I would have jumped on that opportunity. I would hazard that the vast majority of delivery drivers do not know what Bitcoin is. The ones in my location do, but I am currently the only one that has used it.
Next time you order, make the same offer cash or Bitcoin, and make sure the driver knows you will be making this offer each time from this point forward. And make sure you mention this every time you order, since you will not necessarily get the same driver.
Also, the idea of a paper wallet is nice, but unless the driver has a way of verifying the paper wallet at the door, he/she would basically just be trusting you that the QR code was valid; we're not a trusting bunch... so don't be surprised if they turn that down. I'd be able to verify the paper wallet, but no one else that I know of would.

Please correct me if I am wrong, I'm new to Bitcoin. I'm not aware that the chain keeps track of an IP address, maybe I'm wrong.
You would be able to show proof of ownership of those funds with your wallet. Your wallet will show a history of those transactions. If you can show you pulled in the coins and that you paid out the coins, you've shown ownership of those coins. 
Alternately, you can destroy the wallet and all that will be shown is that someone brought in the coins and used them. Unless you use them in away that can be shown that you, specifically you, used them to pay for a product; like sending something to your home mailing address, associating a payment with your legal name used when registering for a website or such.

I'll give your suggestion a try and report back.. I'll be using the code referenced from [here](
Edit: using the code referenced above did me no good. I'm using a USB drive to boot into ubuntu so this might be my root problem, and it might not be worth anyone's time to assist me. That being said. I have the bitcoin tar file on the notebook's hdd. I create a new folder in "Home", but when I reboot that folder disappears and I have to start from scratch. Shouldn't "Home" reside on the USB drive? and creating a new folder should create that folder on the USB drive?
Or maybe I should just install ubuntu on the notebook itself.. hmm

I'm curious why you felt paper wallets were the best way to go.
I've done something similar for my god daughter, except I created a wallet using bitcoin-qt. I encrypted the wallet with a strong password. I created an encrypted thumb drive (using TrueCrypt) and then placed the encrypted wallet.dat file on the thumb drive. The Thumb drive I then gave to my god daughter's parents. I keep a backup of all of this on my own encrypted thumb drives. Since I have a spreadsheet of all the addresses in the wallet.dat I can send BTC to the wallet each year on her birthday from one of my own wallets.

I've been thinking about my question and I have a follow-up. You say the sender pays the transaction fee. How?
If I have 20 BTC and want to send you 5 BTC and there is a transaction fee of 0.005, I see 2 possible results
* I will end up having 14.995 BTC, I paid for the transaction fee using the BTC in my "account", you receive 5BTC
* I will end up having 15BTC, I pay for the transaction fee using the 5BTC I send you, you end up receiving 4.995BTC
Basically I realized that my original question did not ask which set up BTC the transaction fee was deducted from. Which "account" pays the transaction fee? Is that a better way to ask the question?

* Create 10 private keys, write them down on paper. Choose 1 to keep
* Repeat until I have the number of wallets I want, write them all down on paper.
* Scan this in to a PDF, encrypt it, put it on USB drive. 
* Place USB drive in condom, shove up rectum. (Ok this one I won't do, just thought I'd get a laugh)

I don't think I'm expressing my root concern enough.
It's creating a wallet on an inherently unsecure platform, such as Windows OS. I plan on using Truecrypt and possibly another to encrypt the data, that's not the problem. it initially creating the wallet. Look at [How_to_set_up_a_secure_offline_savings_wallet]( this shows creating the wallet **Offline**. I assume this is possible on a Windows OS PC, but my concern is that I **might** have a keylogger/virus. Normally I am not concerned about them, but in this instance I am. Are you following me?

Understand that I am not an expert in finance, programming, math, or IT. I'd like to think I am more intelligent then the "general public", but I also realize I could just have a really big ego and might be talking about things that I completely do not understand. 
I'm wondering if some people are thinking that bitcoins will never be worth more then a couple hundreds US dollars. I don't see how such a small US dollar worth will be practical. Maybe I am looking at this wrong/differently/naively, but I see the representation of the bitcoin in relation to the US dollar. 1.00000000 could be construed as 1,000,000.00; where the last 2 decimal places would represent a fraction of a US dollar.. or cents. So I see that eventually a bitcoin could/should be worth as much as 1,000,000.00 of any fiat currency. Since there will only be 21 million bitcoin, there will be a finite amount of them available. Not everyone will be able to own one entire coin.
I want as many as I can afford right now, because in the long term I think they will be worth more in fiat (I hope I'm using that term correctly) in the future then what i paid for them. But I also intend to use them for certain transaction, and the cost for those goods will be based on the current fiat value of the bitcoin, because that is what the company accepting them will need to convert the bitcoin too, so that the company that accepted them will not fall afoul of their countries laws. (Ok I might be rambling now)
In 5 years the worth of bitcoin will..
*Increase: due to their acceptance
*Decrease: due to them not being accepted, the local governments crack down on them, of for another reason I cannot think of right now
*Stagnate: For whatever reason; I cannot think of one myself right now.
I'm hoping the value of bitcoins increase at a steady pace over the next 5 years, or longer. Maybe I'll purchase a couple BTC for my child's education costs in 19-50 years.

Here's how I see it...
I want to purchase an online service that I am willing to purchase right now, with fiat. I actually have a service in mind (*no it's not porn... but it might be next week*)
I also see BitCoin as a potential investment.
I coincide the purchase of BitCoins with the purchase of the online service I want. I purchase an amount of Bitcoins 2x (in fiat) of the value of the service I plan on purchasing. I pay for the online service within hours of the BitCoin purchase. When I go to purchase the online service using BitCoin I have to decide "Did the value of my bit coin decrease more then I find acceptable? Will paying for the online service with my fiat be more advantageous to me?" Depending on that answer I can then decide to use the BitCoin or my fiat. If I use my fiat, then I am deciding to invest (hold) the BitCoin until it is more advantageous for me to use them.
Since I also see BitCoins as a potential investment, and I have fiat to invest, I can make the decision to invest it. I can choose to invest as little or as much as I want. I decide how much to invest, I decide when to use it. 
Maybe someone can put this in to terms more easily understood.. and using numbers and graphs.

How does this graph indicate how quickly your confirmation will be?

Thanks for explaining that. It was the lack of time reference,  minutes, that I needed. Oh... a possible stupid question.... which side of the transaction pays the transaction fee? The Sender or the Receiver? I don't think I've seen a reference to that in my week of BitCoin education.

If Ubuntu, or another Trusted source, were to accept BitCoin and offer a CD/USB bootable solution for [How_to_set_up_a_secure_offline_savings_wallet]( for those people that want to be secure but do not want to use their time to learn/relearn Linux.
I'd pay for a service like this. Mind you, it would have to be a "Trusted" vendor.

I've just about given up on websites that expect you accept third party cookies/scripts just to view their content. Businessinsider seems to be the worst one I run across. Even after accepting their cookie/script I view the page. Fuck em and every webpage like em.

It does not sound as though you did much of anything to earn the BTC you mined. 
If you had purchased the BTC from the money you earned at a job, then you might have a valid gripe. But you did not, did you? 
Did you pay for equipment used to mine the BTC? 
Did you pay for the electricity used to mine the BTC?

*Please correct me if I am wrong, and I fully realize that there is a distinct possibility that I am wrong.*
Only miners are allowed to verify transactions?
I though I read that by using the [original client]( that you would then be part of the verification network. So I installed that client.
I have further questions/comments, but will reserve them for later.

Thanks joseph11h, I appreciate your willingness to help, but I've decided to go a less arduous path.
