Good luck in getting anything out of it. If you could, go help the others who have cash waiting to hit their banks but coinbase hold their assets.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:28:54
If you are to stupid to do your own research, I guess you don't own a significant amount of BTC or USD or EURO or whatever curreny you prefer, to start to stress and be doubtful about the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:13:03
So you say hundreds and thousands have fucked up in some way or doesnt have valid ID's? Not everyone who bought bitcoin years ago and hodled all the way is shady. Just saying. Stop be so suspicious about everything if you just got in to bitcoin like this year.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:32:59
Ok. So what happens with those 100s of peoples or not thousands of them, withdrawing money from coinbase, bitfinex, bitstamp etc, and the wire doesnt hit their bank? Who sits on their money?
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:14:45
After how long and when? Not right away and by the time something like that will happen, you have to ask your self, what happens with my money?
The federal government doesnt gurantuee you $10 mil dollar like people have lost on bittrex etc.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:18:37
Have you used it for fiat withdrawls? I've used it for depositing fiat and it went smooth.
I just don't want to be panicking when trying to cash out my hard earned BTC to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:03:17
Fees are nothing. I can pay $500 to every $10 0000 I withdraw only if I know it will hit my bank account. But I have been reading some shady stuff about them. Not answering support, not depositing and withdrawin peoples money etc..what the hell?
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:22:13
You have no idea what you are talking about. Hundreds of peoples are getting screwd over coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:30:13
Laws against what? People sitting behind their computers in a 2nd or 3rd world country or even first world country and just sit and accept deposits and not sending out withdrawls?
Look up bistamp subreddit etc.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:19:09
Let's say in Europe. A normal country with working banks and laws and governments etc. Not like ukraine etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:18:00
I would love to go with bistamp. But If you check their subreddit, you see that many people have problem with withdrawing fiat.
This makes me nervous. Like if they have problem, I could have it to.
I dont do money laundering or tax evasion but I just want to get my money asap.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:04:00
When was the last time you used them? Their subreddit have lots of people bashing them and waiting for replies, but I don't see anyone answering them. I've used bitstamp too, but not for large sums which I am about to now. I want my fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:00:24
$1000 is nothing. Try do $10 000 or $100 000 :)
Why is it fud lol?
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:30:00
Yeah, no problem. 
Do you want to avoid taxes? Sell on localbitcoins. What country are you in? It's easier to say because i've been in most countries here and know a few methods. But I would do wire from the exchanges to my private bank account and hope it goes through.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:28:49
Fees could be $500 per 10 000 usd I wouldn't mind. I just need a stable and reliable exchange, thats all.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:02:23
Not a smal sum. Nothing less than $10k. 
Bitstamp have been okay for small sums. Kraken seems like a good alternative.
Damn, is it so hard to f****** have a exchange and be nice to everyone and make money of fees and not be greedy? I dont een have a problem to do KYC questions and filling in those stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:28:16
Yes, it's shitty. We are all nervous about our hard earned BTC.
No point in trading more for me. Not if I can't get direct access to my cash and to spend my coins easily etc..
I'll definetly let you guys know.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:00:44
Not spain but close to. Well you could use localbitcoins or something like that. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:44:46
I am not posting so often on reddit, how can I change the title? Well you understand me.
I am not in the US I said..
Yes, coinbase have problem if you look up their reddit or forumposts from various posters. Can all of them be fake? No.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:38:04
Good luck in even getting out over $10k on a exchange.. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 23:06:30
looks a bit childish to me but as long as you like it haha
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:32:17
The thing is I want to buy a new one Thats never been used.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:12:06
haha not a big toy but everything is a bonus I guess. I would like to get a iPad tho, not really in a use of it tho.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:07:46
yeah that mercedes looks not so new..for someone that got good profits, they probably would buy something "nicer"
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:05:10
Thats a cool story. Does he have photos of his car and plate online? I need to get motivated. Idk what to spend money on. I must reward myself..not everything is about investing and investing all your life.
Haha poor people buying with BTC..that's why I never spend BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:15:56
Lol thats a weird comparsiom. By the grey market do you mean abroad or local watch dealers?
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:27:57
Nice man. U like the rolex more than the breitling? Care to share photos or what model is it
@_date: 2017-07-14 23:05:48
You have two nice watches man...what made you buy 2 instead of one more expensive? I like the rolex submariner or daytona but it's pricy as hell. And even if someone sells it who have owned it, it's still expensive. So I might go for a "cheaper" rolex but new and never used.
Btw, what made you buy watches? Do they increase in value over the year and are they easy to sell? Don't you get afraid to wear the watch in different places? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:06:20
I know travelling is a good experience and gives a good boost in ones life, but if I have a job or maybe I have studies atm, it's not easy to just travel worldwide for weeks or months. I have a vaccation planned anyway but that's a short nice trip then I'll be back again, hopefully.
I can't imagine travelling and eating alone..that bores me out.
@_date: 2017-07-14 22:59:21
You still invested in something that's a scam. People can make profits and good money out of scams. Doge doesn't trade on anything but pump and dumps.
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:45:31
Spend their time on reddit...lol. Do you think it takes hours a day to spend time here? Even the busy businessmen and merchants spend time online. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:27:16
11k is a lot to invest in a scam like doge. With No proper tech or development or anything. Nice tho
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:31:35
Yeah I've read that story a few times. Idk how that guy feels now to be honest. On the other hand, many people have lost lots of bitcoins or other altcoins by corrupt wallets or what so ever, so he is not alone in "losing" coins and then feel bad for it later.
Not many people here buy Lambos with their profits. The more money you put in, the higher risk and the higher return or downturn. Not many people who call them big players or whales are actually affording the lambos. Because with the lambo, you have the insurance, maintance, fuelcost etc. And you would probably live in a big house or a very high and secure complex in order to have a lambo parked in your parking lot.
Everytime someone types the "lambo" thing in reference to BTC or whatever, I kinda get the feeling that they are very new to all this and they haven't actually realized their profits.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:11:06
Valid points. Well I have lost tons of money buy holding and not trading.
For example, I own a coin who is priced at $5, I see it go to $10, I don't sell. Then it falls back to $7. I could make $3 profit on every coin I have, but instead I hold longterm. That way I lose a lot of money too, but it's much secure to hold. The omega looks sick.
Idk what type of watch to buy but as you say, every man needs a rolex I guess. I wish I had looots of more cash. Then I would go for a more expensive one. But a rolex is a rolex and people will get crazy about it wether its a $5000 rolex or $30 000..am I right? lol
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:08:27
I don't have anyone want to take with me while going for the trip, people go to school or work, not everyone have a few grands to put up for a trip like that. 
Rental property require maintenance..
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:26:19
Looks like a Mercedes c class. Lol what does the wallet matter because once you want to cash out, the exchange can steal or hold your coins and lock you out. Not everything is about storing your coins. But yes, the nano Ledger s does 90% of the holding work.
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:44:35
Will do it, Thanks mate. And may more profit come in our way. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:44:54
Thats why I kinda asked what people have bought with their profits, and if they have photos of it. Then I know what I could buy. Right now I cash'ed out a little bit and it's still a lot for me, I could reward my self nice with it.
Seems like people didnt cash out? :D
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:28:21
Yes I am the irs ill Hunt you down. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:10:29
Yeah thats what I thought was the gray market thing. But its not easy to sell your rolex on the used market right? I mean how often would someone buy a rolex and let alone a used one, right?
So its basically money for a nice watch which you cant sell so easily unless you go to a pawnshop and they would give you something like 50% for it right?
It sure is nice to reward one self with those luxury stuff. Ive never been in the luxury segment with very very expensive stuff and I am still at a Young age so it does feel weird to me but hey I guess this is life.
