Wow dude. That's terrible. Did you figure out for sure what caused your loss??
@_date: 2014-04-15 23:38:17
This is superb news.  Ive bought from cex a number of times,  never sold to them though.  Fonebank / ebay /gumtree for me.

No. I didn't back it up :( 
I did have titanium backups of my phone, which would have held the correct app and data but I deleted them during my spring clean on Sunday.
I know I created the wallet on the phone, and I know I would have used one of about 5 passwords.
When creating the wallet on a phone, you enter the password once, right at the beginning, then use the pin from then on in.
All I can think is that I mistyped the password whilst setting the wallet up, and because its not verified by entering twice, i missed it.
I've not lost much, its about £120, and it is my first BTC related loss in two years of using the currency.
The coin is still in the wallet, and will be forever it looks like.

I used to think Max was cool. I seen through it since the silver pump. He used this wallet. It was published on his site as a begging address, his "cigar fund" .
He did a standup show in my home town about 18 months back charging about 60GBP a ticket.
Watch out for keiser. Same ilk as Gerald Celente. A heeb pushing physical silver to us, and invested in paper himself.
Oh did you hear about the rip off he was involved in when he first pushed his own silver rounds??

yeah, that's where I'm trying. Left the phone alone in case there is a chance of retrieving the wallet.dat

Note 3 here too. I wish your problem was my problem and my problem was your problem.
Peace bro.

I saw this. Has the CEO resigned again?
@_date: 2014-04-17 13:19:49
Exactly the same situation. I'm sure it was an auto update that signed me out. The update of another app was the last thing I did on my phone before it signed me out.
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:53:18
that's easier said than done!

I've been trying for a couple of hours now. Probably time to write it off. Lessons will be learned, as those in power are often quoted as saying.

So, I got my coins back. Here's how.
I ran a program called EaseUS Data Recovery on the SD card of my phone. I found a titanium backup, installed that and it went perfectly. Opened the app and it just asked for the PIN which obviously I knew. I've moved the coins and binned the wallet. Happy ending :)

Sorry for your loss.  Your loss is our gain.  Thankyou. 
@_date: 2015-09-11 14:29:38
Gosh.  Rubbish is this! 
I bet the fees/exchange rates and commission are a minefield with this.
