No, you are creating new debt (mowing the lawn) and paying with the same money. The debt would never be paid off, only the money owed for mowing the lawn. OR the person who originally was owed the debt is basically forgiving the debt for free. OR you mow the lawn 15 times to pay off the $30 of debt at $2 per mow.

Whatever it is, it should only be 3 words long. I read somewhere that the best slogans are 3 words or less. Just do it, just say no, I'm loving it, do no evil, do the Dew, etc are some quick examples.

A *huge* argument for running your own full node if you are going to try and provide some 3rd party service. Don't be a 5th or 6th party removed from a full node...
