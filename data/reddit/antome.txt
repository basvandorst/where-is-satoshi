As a New Zealander, for the longest time I was wondering what people were even talking about when they mentioned double spaces after periods, at which point I realized that  the vast majority of sites format-out double spaces anyway, so it never occurred to me in the first place. Like in your post, for example.
What was the original justification for double spaces? Readability? I guess it made more sense on older typewriters/printers.

Chances are they were either on holiday, or residents there.

MPC-HC with madVR, xysub, reclock and LAV plugins(or more conveniently, [KCP which combines all of this]( provides a far more configurable and nicer-looking viewer experience, supports more formats as well as newer formats faster, and is being far more actively developed. MadVR also recently introduced a new image scaler which takes advantage of neural networks and new edge-directed interpolation, which is pretty cool.
The really cool settings require a beefy GPU, though any hardware will benefit from the various plug-ins.

This wave of arbitrary currencies and values feels like something out of a medieval merchant's memoirs.

Is bitcoin making the newspapers over there? It's awesome that we have a culture far more aware of disruptive technology compared to when the internet first showed up.

I was thinking more arbitrary in it's human intervention. People making new currencies all the time, with different proportions of difficulty, trying to ride off of the initial wave of "no one quite knows its value yet", much like how kingdoms would introduce or change the materials in coins frequently, to help squeeze some extra funds and keep merchants guessing.

With your argument, 99% of anything isn't a lot, because 99% of a dollar is only 99 cents. I guess I can retire now.
