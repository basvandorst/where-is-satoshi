Circle does not charge commission. What 2.9% are you talking about?

You most definitely can
I have a checking account with chase and they gave me a VISA debit card that works literally anywhere.  Even places that don't accept debit cards you can tell them to scan it as credit and it will go through

It's really entertaining for me to think that there's probably some 11 year old computer whiz kid who didn't really know what he was doing and bought a bunch of bitcoin for dollars apiece

"Early adopter"

Someone who bought in early.
If you got bitcoin at $8, that Lambo would cost ~$200
Although... ROI on a lambo is a lot worse than bitcoin

43 Bitcoins is way too much for college?
I wish I could pay for college with 43 bitcoins.  Average cost of tuition in the US is ~$30,000 per year.  That does not even include the additional $10,000 per year for room &amp; board.

You are 100% correct.  Although I never said BitPay uses the Mt.Gox price for bitcoins - just that they used an averaged value.  But I did not know this didn't include Mt. Gox.
Regardless, my point was that the BitPay exchange rate is higher than the cost to purchase a bitcoin on some exchanges, and so BitPay can be used as a relatively risk-free method of arbitrage.

What I mean is, it sounds like bitcoin was a gamble for you.  If you wanted to 'make your money work' why did you cash out to pay off the student loans?  Rather than keep them and keep riding bitcoin out

I'm gonna play devil's advocate here and say that although it turned out okay, this was not a wise financial decision.
Rule  of investing is only risk money you know you can lose, and boy is Bitcoin a risky investment.
I know the sentiment here is that Bitcoin is only ever going to go up, but Bitcoin is extremely volatile and you should not have hedged an entire $5,000 investment in bitcoins when you had $15,000 of student loans to pay off.  
While it's great to hear all these success stories about people who got in early and are now filthy rich, I know somebody is eventually going to do something stupid like mortgage their house to buy bitcoins and end up royally screwed if it doesn't go where they want it to go.
Just my 2 satoshis

Public schools cost around $11,000/yr for tuition.  Plus $10,000 room and board comes out to about $20,000.  So 43 bitcoins would still not even cover one year of living expenses.

Why not spend the $5000 to pay off your debt instead?
