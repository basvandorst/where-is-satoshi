Sent in 20 btc a long time ago to do some trading, turned it into 30 btc, when I tried to withdraw, I couldn't. 
Sent a ticket and continued my life of day trading. 2 weeks later, still no ticket reply and mtgox froze withdraws. Now that 30 has turned into 174 and I can't get it out. 
Still, my heart is in turmoil, the idea of gox begin dead is so sweet but the fact that they have my money really hurts.
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:51:06

Let me use this opportunity to tell my own story.
Last year, after the April bubble, I was traveling around to as many countries as I could during the holidays.
On my way back home from the last country I visited, I was late to the airport and had only £15 left in my bank account. 
So I was basically in a country where I knew no one and had no money, the airport was in an isolated area, there were a few taxis but to go back to town would have cost me around £120 not £15, the last bus coming to the airport that day was the bus I took. Oh, and there was no flight back to London for the next 3 days. 
Yup.. at this point I was planning to call my parents in shame and ask them to spot me some cash cause my student friends sure as fucking shit did not have the kind of cash I needed laying around.
And then it hit me bitcoin? internet? localbitcoins.com? Took out my phone, connected to wifi, managed to get 2k into my bank account in about 30 minutes and took a taxi back to town, rented a hotel, had fun for 3 days and flew back home.

@_date: 2013-05-12 10:13:35
Wait a minute.. I'm already gambling by buying when I think btc is low and selling when I think it's high, why would I take it further and play satoshi dice as-well? Play hard, die hard.
