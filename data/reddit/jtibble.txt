Depending on what wallet software you are using, there might not be any need to reconnect your laptop to the internet. The 'bitcoins' are yours as long as you control the only copy of the private key belonging to the public address of the bitcoins. The best way to make sure that the bitcoins are solely in your control and not at-threat is to print a paper wallet and send the bitcoins there. The private key is physically printed on the paper and so you can guarantee that they are 'secure'. Of course, getting them off the paper, making them spendable, takes a tad bit more work, but is well worth-it in my view.

Has there been any thought to having the app store my username and password? After the whole hacking-shenanigans, I upgraded my password to something like 25 characters. Most of which are difficult and time-consuming to type on my Android keyboard. If we could, perhaps, have the option of storing them, I think it would be a really great feature (and for the more security-minded, they could leave it unstored).

Do you know how much a bitcoin is worth? Do you think that somebody will give you a full bitcoin, out of the generosity of their heart?
A single bitcoin can be written as 1.00000000 BTC, divisible to eight decimal places. I can send you a tiny fraction of a bitcoin to play with with if you'd like, but not a full one.

@_date: 2015-03-26 19:25:16
So let me make sure I understand this... investors have to have held their GBTC funds for months and months, then have to transfer them somewhere... and only then they can sell to a buyer? With that much friction, how could they possibly hope to get any serious volume going?
Also, if I was the winning bidder, how quickly could I then sell, or would I have to wait months as well?

You are not wrong! :D the price of bitcoin has changed dramatically over the past few years!
If you want people to send you some bitcoin to play with, try this:
1. Download the bitcoin software of your choosing
2. Create a new bitcoin address
3. Sign a message with the address saying "KingOfKingsOfKings01 owns this bitcoin address 1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" and post it here!
4. People will verify you own the address and send you bitcoin to play with!
A little research will teach you how to do these things, and you will learn more about how bitcoin and bitcoin-security work.
@_date: 2016-05-04 14:05:26
Your signed message should look something like this, at the bottom of the image:  
edit:  or 
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:05:02
Probably is! However, it is good to prove that you control a bitcoin address by signing a message with it! If you can sign a message with that address, we can prove that you control the address and therefore are the owner!
@_date: 2015-03-19 12:51:23
Destroying BTC (sending them to a black-hole address) does nothing to effect the mining difficulty.
If the BTC were destroyed in a public way, then it might push the markets slightly higher relative to other global currencies, but only slightly. Every bitcoin sent in a transaction to a new/unused address is "lost" until the owner of that address can prove they have the private key and can sign a transaction sending the bitcoins on to some other address.

Bitcoins are site-agnostic. One of the major strengths of bitcoin is that it is trivial to pull them out of a site/wallet and send them to another site/wallet. This process is nearly instant, and nearly free. If you think you can make a profit by playing the arbitrage game, go for it, but be wary of hidden fees!

All the computers checking the correctness of the bitcoin network are doing a hard math problem. To the solve the problem, their solution to this hard math problem must be below a certain value. How difficult it is to find a solution to this problem is the "difficulty". Depending on how many computers are working on solving the problem during a given two-week period, the difficulty will increase or decrease to keep the rate-of-problem-solving roughly steady at 10 minutes.

If you sell them through Coinbase, I think you would need to sell just a hair over 1BTC (maybe 1.04-ish?) to get $100. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:27:44
If people would leave their buy and sell orders on the books, it would increase the market depth and prevent huge price-swings, but instead, folks jump in with 10,000-bitcoin buys or sells, and the market can't take that without becoming unstable at this point.

Check this out:
It's a graph of all bitcoin addresses, plotted by balance as a function of the last time they were involved in a transaction.
As you can see, a huge number of coins (the nearly-solid line at 50BTC, and at 25BTC) have never been moved. Gaps in that line show where coins were mined, and then moved.

That's true, but if you get *two* 10,000BTC orders, each on either side of a price, the price will happily sit in that channel and bounce back and forth until one of the two parties removes their order or the market pushes through in one direction or the other. That time spent in the channel, so to speak, lets other orders filter in over time, until the normal buy/ask spread is set up by the community and day-traders again.
