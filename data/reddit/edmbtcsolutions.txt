What about the other 6 billion people in the world? AKA not influenced by the US government? I am assuming you reside in US? German government (Hitler) invented the "cleanse" a government created protocol. Was this a good idea too? Maybe everything government invented isn't the best?

Funny you should say that. I'm in touch with two airports right now! Do you know anyone in an airport that would be in charge of this decision?

Hey! This machine in Saskatoon gets it's rates from Vault of Satoshi that is updated real time. Transaction fee is currently set to 8%. The KYC is seamless with SMS verification at the machine. The withdraw limit is $3000/24 period/customer (tracked by phone number). It will buy and sell Bitcoin! Selling feature will be available mid week of next week. Thanks for getting in touch!
@_date: 2014-09-17 15:51:29
That would be great! We have tried several to no avail. They aren't quite ready to change the world!

Now wouldn't it be nice if we had a universal way of sending a commodity between communities. :-) pleasure speaking with you! Love the debate!
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:20:04
Currently 8%  but stay tuned for an awesome promotion in a couple days!

What is your response to Gold then? What makes its value? What makes it sustainable? What is your reaction to the fact that despite the recent Bitcoin struggles the value is double what it was worth this time last year? We appreciate your opinions!
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:23:17
Thanks! Give it a try and let us know how it is!
@_date: 2014-05-03 22:55:22
Haha, when you take into account the $$ charged from the bank to wire money to an online exchange, the fee the exchange (of often 3rd party) charges to wire, the % they then charge on top of the trade, the fee to withdraw that Bitcoin/cash and then time it takes to have the whole process work we think 8% is more than fair... not to mention the risk that bank accounts associated with Bitcoin are constantly being shut down which is the biggest risk of all! We appreciate the feedback!

We're looking to hit the Bitcoin spots in town. Are there any pubs/cafes that are accepting Bitcoin as payment?
@_date: 2014-05-24 22:42:19
Hey there! Thanks for the info! Do you have contact info or ties with anyone? Which do you recommend would be best? Anyone that excepts Bitcoin, I think, really understands the importance (and benefits) of having an ATM in there shop! So it shouldn't be hard to have them on board with hosting one! I like the idea of this 20mission and will be in touch with them! ***20Mission if you are reading this please email info
Thanks again for your info!
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:55:55
You bet! I am expecting a lot more once the news gets out also. It is a small community in Saskatoon but once the stories go mainstream... hopefully that community grows!
@_date: 2014-06-01 04:53:40
There are only 2. We have one more coming to Sherwood Park in the next few weeks and there is rumoured to be another coming downtown shortly! So that will make Edmonton the hub for ATMs! The only reason is the large Bitcoin industry here and an amazing amount of support! No other reason!
@_date: 2014-06-15 06:41:39
This is a Skyhook ATM. It is operated by Bitcoin Solutions so if there are any issues you will be dealing with them. Otherwise you are able to head there at your convenience! Just in case it hasn't been said enough... 24/7/365!!!
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:02:21
Ah, but you didn't answer any of my questions. Great, the government likes USD too... we all know how that worked out in 2007... they like it so much they print and print and print it making it worthless. If thats what the government does to things they like well I just hope they don't like Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:39:44
That sounds very appealing! Can you put us in touch with those locations? Email info and let us know!
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:04:45
2 million merchants accepting Bitcoin isn't exactly a problem. How many people used the internet in the first 5 years of its creation?
@_date: 2014-05-05 00:24:47
Hey! Would be interested in meeting? We are in Saskatoon until Wednesday and would love to meet fellow bitcoin users in SK! Email us at info
@_date: 2014-05-24 23:24:09
I think your info is a little skewed. The seller in Florida knowingly sold to the customer who's sole intent was to purchase stolen credit cards. This is the main reason for the jailtime - it just happened to deal with BTC. When an online child pornographer goes to jail it is not because of the internet nor is it the internet's fault.
USA has yet to officially declare Bitcoin as a currency therefore it is not a money transmission. 
Again, I appreciate the info and will continue to look into it. 
Nice work in Seattle! Hopefully we can meet up and discuss strategies in the future.
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:05:06
Sorry it took so long to reply! I'm not sure what your asking though? How much what?
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:38:15
Great point! The military would thrive if they adopted Bitcoin. Is there much traffic in those locations you suggested? Our goal is to make Bitcoin as accessible as possible to as many people as possible! If you have contact info for those needed to make such a decision email us at info
@_date: 2014-05-04 09:06:50
We are always working on new and improved! We are going to make sure Bitcoin is flawless and then add other cryptos (LTC first) ... look for that in 3 months or so! Thanks for posting!
@_date: 2014-07-02 20:30:08
Hey there! We are in vancouver now! drop us a line info
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:38:55
Only 60% of the market is in circulation. Still 10 million Bitcoin to be introduced into circulation. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 04:52:11
6% over Bitpay's exchange!
@_date: 2014-05-24 23:04:30
I understand. But the other ATM operators in the USA are not going to jail. I realise coinme is credited and granted an MTL but as far as I understand it is not necessary. Recommended, and in the process of being acquired, but not necessary for launch. Correct me if I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 23:41:13
Haha! I like your style! Any leads on where I can get said car? If you find me a car that can have a secure ethernet and constant power source without killing the earth (and our wallet) of burning gas let me know!
@_date: 2014-05-23 23:46:37
The beauty of these machines is they are sought out! Our last machine was launched in a small town in Saskatchewan, Canada and it had over 15 news articles and aired on half dozen radio/tv stations - the traffic seems to follow it! Especially if people need Bitcoin (which is what these machines are designed to achieve; make it accessible) is there anything, even in a quieter area, that is accepting? Or is San Fran super behind the times?!
@_date: 2014-05-23 23:52:38
Great! Thanks, mate! Let me know if you think of anything else or need anything from us at Bitcoin Solutions!
@_date: 2014-05-23 23:28:39
this is really great! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:36:10
We have an associate looking into locations for a machine in Regina! If you own or know a business that would be happy to host one let us know! info
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:52:42
Ed and Ethan were great contacts and we were lucky to meet them! They don't actually have anything to do with the ATM itself, however. We did enjoy tuning into their show when it was on!
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:21:21
No handprint or ID. Same as our machine on whyte. QuickBT is great. But not if your worried about your ID and palm being scanned... This is good to go 24/7/365 at your convenience on your terms!
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:57:53
BitcoinCEO back from the dead!?! How can this be?! Haha, nice to have you posting. I heard the CEO of USD and CEO of EUR were on vacation? Did you go with them?
@_date: 2014-05-24 22:44:20
Thanks for the info. However the ATM is a little different than local Bitcoins. I also won't be doing $30k+/transaction without any AML/KYC. The ATM is in full compliance (exceeding) with all regulations for AML/KYC. In regards to the fincen documents - they have not regulated Bitcoin and there is nothing a Bitcoin business can apply for - believe me, I've tried! As far as they are concerned these ATMs spit out dust! 
again, appreciate the thought and concern!
@_date: 2014-05-03 23:07:20
I'm sure we could argue both points back and forth for days! Thanks again for getting in touch! info if you wanna keep debating :-)
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:11:07
Well put!!!
@_date: 2014-05-05 13:09:00
Hey! No plans for Regina in the near future. We are being stretched thin having 2 in 2 different provinces and adding a third in BC in the next few months! That being said, I think within the next year or so we would be able to have in Regina! For the time being, if you are ever in Saskatoon, feel free to come use the machine! Give us some feedback!
Thanks!
