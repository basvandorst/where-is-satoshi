the fact you refer to it as 'the bitcoin' and you've been registered on this site for just sevens weeks tells me you won't be getting an answer from anyone worthwhile. it's not up to anyone to convince you. why would they care whether you're on board or not?

I won't answer your five concerns above but will say I think Bitcoin's main pull is or will be the fact it is anonymous. We're heading towards a cashless society where every Tom, Dick and Harry working for gov will know what you've spent and where. Cash is King and Bitcoin will replace that imo.

I invested £50k (all my savings and part loan) a few months back and have doubled my input if i cash out now. I'm in for the long haul though... this is early doors and £50k ain't gonna change my life. 
edit: I also had a few BTC from the early days hanging around - just bought more
edit: all you losers saying don't invest more than you can afford to lose... you're going to leave this planet one day with all the things you came with: absolutely fuck all. 
If I can maximize my living standards during my short time here by taking a speculative punt on what I think will be a life-changing technology then i'm in for it. The worst case scenario is I'll be a 9-5 bitch all my life, which I would have been anyway without investing.

Used Localbitcoins for years until they banned me last week without telling me why. Said I posed 'high risk'... asked what that meant and they said: "Decision is final."
Weirdos.

hang on... you had the balls to take a second mortgage and go all-in with bitcoin, but you're too much of a pussy to deal with price fluctuations? I smell BS or you're a massive cuck.

Hang on... one minute he's selfish but the next he's concerned how he'll make the crypto scene look by getting involved. Which one is it?

Nothing I see in that list is racist. What's racist about calling Afghanistan a haven for terrorists? Or Mexican drug cartels "animals?" 
And other stuff that I would agree is racist has "allegedly" or "reportedly" in front of it.
Can you help further please?
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:44:13
Nothing racist there. Got anything else?
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:38:13
Calling Mexican drug cartels animals and describing Afghanistan as a terrorist haven is not racist. And the other stuff in that list has all been denied or is filled with "allegedly". 
Not one thing on that list has convinced me Donald Trump is racist. Can you help further?
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:43:38
Yes, it was a sincere comment. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 09:37:41
"Right. Since you are one of the water isn't wet crowd I'll go ahead and ignore you from now on."
OK, that's a shame.
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:42:43
What has Trump or Bannon said/done that's racist?
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:01:42
no honour in being a pussy, my friend. a lot of people who took big risks have made a lot of money these past six months - and they're now buying back in for even more coins.
have fun with your crumbs.
truth is bitcoin isn't even about the investment/financial reward - it's a bonus. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:09:27
I salute you sir. Couldn't have put it better myself. Had enough of these pussies talking about investing what you can afford to lose and cashing out for a few quid profit. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:48:57
What are you talking about you bellend?
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:49:54
OP you are a pussy. Please stop telling people what to do with their money and if Bitcoin reaches moon please don't ask favours from the gutsy/shrewd little people who risked it all for huge wealth. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:14:42
you signed up to reddit a week ago and have posted nothing but your  thoughts on how bitcoin is going to zero. 
can i take a guess that you are  a salty no-coiner who was dumb enough not to buy before the rally to 19k last year and even dumber not to have sold at the top? :) :) :) i think i'm correct.

How do you feel about money now you're pretty comfortable? What's most important to you in life post-wealth?
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:09:54
I'm not one to talk but you've been on reddit for 20 minutes and wanna tell people how to behave with their Bitcoin....  cool story bro
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:54:24
thanks very much, I appreciate the replies - especially as there's probably loads of other similar posts.
