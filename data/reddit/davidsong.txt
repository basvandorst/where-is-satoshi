Nothing apart from the amount of money required to set one up, right? And you'd need to connect to other connected hubs, hubs that require similar investments and are likely to be regulated and only want to connect to other regulated money transmitter nodes.
I can see there being two main Lightning networks, the most popular and useful one being tightly regulated.

So... if I'm getting this, to buy some weed with Bitcoin you have to pay say $15 to set up an account, lock $200 up indefinitely and pay a smaller fees each time you spend $20 use the account, then pay $15 if you want to close the account. That's ~10% fees, locking up 10x more money than you're spending in a highly volatile currency, and losing deniability about recurring darknet spends.
Or you can just use another crypto that has smaller fees, is more anonymous and no weird rules about how you spend it.

No it uses an algorithm to choose the fees, and it's based on the fees on recent transactions and the size of the mempool. That's what people pay.
Fee in Electrum is 110 to 500 Satoshi/byte. So a 500 byte transaction right now, this Sunday evening, will cost between about $6 (4 hours) and about $30 (10 mins).

Grabbing a few random samples over the years, it looks like upward swings of over 10% in a day are pretty normal, but downward ones tend to happen over longer periods.
From the point of view of funds held in escrow on darknet markets, I guess the period needs to be somewhere between the average shipping time and the escrow expiry time. Shipping would be several days domestic or weeks internationally, and I can't remember what Silk Road's escrow timeout was, but a month sounds about right.
bitcoincharts doesn't do monthly candlesticks, but looking at the weekly ones it does seem like we've been in a period of extreme volatility over the past few months, comparable to the bubble of 2013. (It's worth looking at what happened after that bubble in 2014!)

Mining was all but lost as soon as the first generation of ASICs were manufactured, maybe even slightly before that during the second generation of mining FPGAs. An average person or even a small business doesn't have and can't get efficient mining hardware from anywhere other than a mining company, who have huge incentives to either mine with it or withhold the technology entirely.
This has put a lot of money and even more power in the hands of Chinese miners, and I don't think that can change unless there's a change to the proof of work algorithm that makes home mining possible again. I can't see that happening in the near term, but I think it's important to mention it when the topic of miner centralization and power crops up.

I don't think the big-blockers are arguing against off-chain scaling mechanisms, they were mostly arguing for an increase of block size now so that the network isn't crippled by fees, which it currently is. Bitcoin runs a real risk of losing its first mover advantage and being usurped by the competition.
The sad thing is that right now this would be a positive thing for consumers, they'd be able to actually make payments with the  cryptocurrency.
Having said that, no popular crypto has solved the scaling problem yet, so any currency that did have a chance of taking over would quickly be flooded like Bitcoin is (e.g. Ethereum), so there's time to get more off-chain scaling in place, but the clock is ticking and a 2MB block size would have bought the project bit more time.

So you think that if blocks had doubled in size, then the sum of all fees paid would have also doubled? Do you think the price would have also doubled, assuming all that extra utility?
As for Ethereum they've got quite a cool block scaling mechanism, the miners can vote to increase the gas limit, but increasing it also increases the rate of duplicate blocks found ("uncles"). Miners get paid for uncles in Ethereum's scheme, but the uncle rate is so high that miners won't vote for size increases even though the network is congested. Consensus is that they're boned unless they shard, and to do that they need to ditch proof of work.


The people who are actually using BCH are the extreme end of the scale, that and those who are gambling or buying drugs. There are plenty of people, like myself, who would prefer a modest increase over none but aren't willing to ditch bitcoin's dev team over it.

The vast majority of cryptographers who could have invented Bitcoin work for governments, the number of professional cryptographers in the private sector is maybe 1% of the total. All other things being equal, it's a hundred times more likely that Satoshi was a government employee. Given the early papers there's a pretty strong likelihood that they've been sat on at least similar tech for a long time, and the timing for Bitcoin's arrival is just after the 2008 financial collapse.
If you look at what was happening in the nation state hacking space at this time, ( by Shane Harris has a good overview if you're into book recommendations) and the history of physical counterfeiting by America's enemies to undermine the dollar, I wouldn't be surprised if the 2008 financial collapse was caused or at the very least exacerbated by nation state hackers.
I've worked in banking and their systems are basically shit-tier software funded by people who know the price of everything and the value of nothing, outsourced to the lowest bidder; they're Swiss cheese. Are we really expected to believe that billions, if not trillions of fraudulent wealth hasn't been created out of thin air by hackers with a billion dollar budget, given that China and Russia managed to penetrate pretty much every US government system and steal trade secrets from all major corporations around the same time? An uncorruptable distributed ledger solves this problem and creates an economy for securing systems, and was invented by an anonmyous hacker right after the financial collapse that nearly took down the world economy. And then this tech that directly threatens the dollar and allows all sorts of financial crime was ignored and privately greenlit by Western governments right from the early days, being allowed to go pretty much unchallenged.
That doesn't smell right to me. I can't know all that and not strongly suspect that Satoshi was an NSA/GCHQ collaboration or DARPA project.

I can't open a client to check right now but this feels like you're understating the costs here, I assume for the point of argument. If transaction fees were $1 then users wouldn't really need lightning in the first place, they would just pay $1 to send $20 to their darknet market account instead. But they aren't, they're using other coins because transaction fees are too high.


Yeah I get that, except there's no pegging to local currencies on the bitcoin network so you can't lock in at a specific dollar amount; that $200 might gain 100% in a week or lose 35% overnight. You and I may be hodlers but we're in it for the ride, I don't think it's reasonable to consider it a bank account with such hefty price swings, or that it's practical or desirable for normal users to be forced to hold.


Because the node you're using starts implementing KYC/AML or refuses to do business with you because they can see that you've been gambling, buying drugs, you sent a transaction from a disallowed country or a tor node, or perhaps they shut down and don't exist anymore, they started charging too much for transactions, or are blocked on other nodes in the network.

From what I understand that's not possible. The lightning channel is a type of smart contract that locks a specific amount of bitcoin up, allowing the user to create off-chain transactions between different lightning nodes up to the value of the original deposit, and can close the channel and get only the remaining money back out again.
You need an investment and you need to accept Bitcoin's volatility in order to use Lightning. Having said that, an exchange could have a huge amount locked up and you could convert from fiat and then transfer using lightning from the exchange, but at this point you're not really using Bitcoin or "being your own bank"

High fees are a manifestation of the scaling problem, which is the biggest problem in blockchain right now.

A nation state attack would be the worst-case scenario.
* Proof of work schemes could be banned because they are burning the planet's resources, or huge green taxes applied to usage of PoW cryptocurrencies.
* Asynchronous backdoors inserted into OS and CPU random number generators by intelligence agencies could be found, meaning keys generated on normal operating systems and hardware occupy a much smaller keyspace than expected. The people who have this backdoor could spend most other people's money.
* Quantum attacks used to spend all money from accounts that have known public keys, which is any address that has sent money (including addresses that are currently sending money). This could first steal from everyone who's got money in an address that has previously spent funds, and secondly steal from anyone who is currently spending money. This would grind the network to a halt, making it impossible to exchange coins (at least until it's patched, which by then might be too late).
* A nation state could coordinate an attack on the network and important people in the community; remotely exploiting all online nodes with funds (assuming they have OS and bitcoin core 0-days), buying enough mining power to cripple the network, force an exploit into new code versions by threatening the families of developers, then use the exploit to later destroy the network.
* Satoshi could reappear and trade all of his bitcoin into some other currency.

Snowden was an NSA contractor, he had intimate knowledge of the intelligence game and how information can and should be used, but objected to its illegal use against American citizens.
Assange on the other hand is a hacker, and like the oldskool anarchistic hackers he believes that knowledge should be free and its our duty to free it. Not just for people from his country but for all people, and not just information about illegal deeds but information about all kinds of unethical deeds, whether leaking that information is legal or not.
They are very different people and come from very different places, and while I thank Snowden I have a lot more respect for Assange's position.

Yeah it's sad that we can't even have a rational discussion about this because we're living in an age of weaponized social media. Smear tactics, us-v-themisms and shouting down outweigh facts.
Right now the average cost of a transaction is $25, and rising prices will push it up even further. You can't buy a game on Steam with Bitcoin and god knows what the darknet markets are using nowadays, I'd be daft to renew my VPN, VPS and seedboxes with it; Bitpay must be praying for this bubble to burst so they can get back to business. It's not just Bitcoin either, Ethereum's in a similar position, their transactions are in the region of $1 and will also grow with the network's utility.
I think the scaling issue is far harder than people are making out, and it makes this price unsustainable. I'm not saying 8MB blocks would have worked either, they'll likely cause different capacity problems as they fill up.

I think you mean the economy consists of "hostile altcoiners" who will ditch bitcoin for reasons of practicality. If Bitcoin can't compete it will die, and the death of cryptocurrencies is a very natural and real way of solving the blockchain space problem; disposable chains are better than off-chain transactions.
No need to be a ridiculous fanboy, it's a technology not a cult. I've a lot of money in bitcoin and none in Ethereum, but I can see Ethereum unseating Bitcoin in the near future purely because it supports higher transaction throughput and they're dedicated to solving the scaling problem.

Fix it or let it die. Multiple dying chains will most likely be the solution to the disk space issue. If you've got a better solution let's hear it.


Because you don't have any technical insight at all and just parrot what other people say?


But you're against decentralisation. Alt-coins are a form of decentralisation. Bitcoin mining is centralised.




Because it's actually still innovating and has more possible uses. I don't think it's blockchain's final form, but it's miles ahead of bitcoin.


Does it? Users still run full nodes and mine at home on GPUs. Can the same be said for bitcoin?




Do some research. They are moving to proof of stake and possibly sharding to address the scaling issues. 




Somewhat true, but a stretch. Bitcoin is crippled by centralised mining power, conservative dev goals and in-fighting. Vitalik's benevolent dictatorship is IMO preferable to that.


It's technically more capable; it can and does do more than bitcoin. It's more complex and dangerous


Really? We'll see eh?


They had a choice to either allow billions to be taken from the economy or to fork, and judging by the size of the economy now I think it was a good idea.

Roger has done as much, if not more for Bitcoin. He accepted bitcoin for payment before payment platforms were a thing and made a killing by holding before HODL was a thing. He paid for Bitcoin [billboard]( and [radio ads]( back in 2011, was chasing down hackers via bitcoin bounty hunter, and he was the original Bitcoin Jesus before he became Bitcoin Judas.
It was only when transaction fees went up so high that Bitcoin became useless for payments, the sort of payments that his Bitcoin-accepting business relies on, only then did he get involved in forcing a block size increase. Bad idea to get involved in a contentious fork, but I think he did it because he's the sort of irrational idealist that would go all in because he really cares about Bitcoin as a payment platform.
He's gone about it the wrong way and become involved in an open war between BTC and BCH, but let's not forget that he was one of Bitcoin's soldiers for 6 long years (I can't remember a time without him). He's really pissed the money off, that's his crime here.

It's been like this since the very beginning, right at the start Bitcoin attracted cypherpunks and libertarian anarcho-capitalists in equal numbers.
I think we can thank the libertarians for much of Bitcoin's early success. It was their desire for a decentralized, deflationary currency completely outside government control that gave it much of its early value. Also loads of early developers were libertarians too, i.e. previous Bitcoin Jesus and now pariah Roger Ver, Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, probably most of the whales too, and certainly most of the early scammers.

It denies me the legal right to create derived works, derived works were the default mode of all cultural progression before widespread copyright. DRM is an implementation detail, restrictions management exists within the framework of copyright protection.


I disagree. Once someone has published their work they no longer own it, any control over other people is done through artificial constructs created by our legal system. Copyright is not a moral rights, but part of the [copyright bargain]( The morality of copyright ownership is a marketing position pushed by the copyright industry, and it's foolish to swallow their propaganda without carefully dissecting it. Holding the meme does not benefit you as a consumer or society as a whole, it's marketing that exists to benefit the various copyright industries.


No. I would just prefer that they work for an honest wage. For example switching to a model where they get paid for actually working rather than being paid by a stealth tax on the population. In a free society everyone has a right to make a living, but they don't have a right to demand money from me when I have no business with them. If a friend shares something with me then that's between me and my friend, not third parties who lay dubious claims on my private communications.


This is a more reasonable stance but it doesn't go far enough IMO, but that aside a fixed-length term would be easier to deal with contractually.


But it's not though, you list exceptions that prove the rule. People make independent art, but the vast majority of what is consumed is expensive and produced by large, established publishers. This applies not just to art but to tools and consumer goods in general.

But unless they signed something they're under no obligation to not share it, in fact sharing is the moral thing to do here. The reason you believe sharing without permission is wrong is because you've been subjected to a lifetime of propaganda by the copyright industry.


But it always did. That's the way ideas have always worked.


The person or people who asked you to do the work. If nobody agreed to pay you to do it then why should you expect money for doing it?


I reject the notion that a copy of some produced works are the original product. The product is the product of their work, is the direct output of the ongoing process of creation. If I copy your works from a different person then you're no longer the one producing it; duplication is itself production, and it's extremely cheap.


Only because the TV series was created with today's copyright paradigm in mind. If that didn't exist then there would be no real difference, and I'm arguing for an end to that paradigm.


I agree, and obviously choose my battles. I'm all for reducing copyright powers before outright abolishing it, but I still think it's an immoral system and part of the very reason it's bad is because it segregates people into "producers" and "consumers". These are marketing words that oppress society and undermine the creativity of all human beings in the name of maximizing profit.


I've thought about this for rather a long time and while it may seem absurd given the history of our timeline, not having copyright is both the default and the moral stance. I'm not arguing for plagiarism, I'm arguing against state-sanctioned monopolies on culture in order to promote as close to full participation in creativity as possible. I'm not a die hard IP hater or an anarchist either, I support limited forms of trademarks, patents with limited scope and short durations, strong privacy law and weak trade secrets.


Me too. I actually think that binaries are nothing but a loophole, exploiting the rules around derived works and shouldn't be covered by copyright law under our current system, and in an ideal world binaries without source would be banned as dangerous. If the source code isn't available then they can offer nothing in the copyright bargain, so why should we as a society offer them protection under the rules of that bargain?
Since nobody says this around here, I've enjoyed debating this with you. It's nice to disagree with someone and it not turn to abuse, like threads in do.

Let's have a look at your post in detail eh?


This is inflammatory, it's somewhat true, but it's still inflammatory.


This is a rude and unhelpful ad hominem with nothing to back it up. A better approach is to calmly describe what you believe to be the difference between what you think and what they think. If you know they're wrong then **refute the central point**. To an onlooker like myself this reads like mud slinging.


A sneering, belittling remark. Refute the central point.


Okay this has some merit, but what do you mean by it? Are you saying that calculations in that header file shows the segregated witness is integrated into the block size? Are you familiar with the source? I'm no expert on Bitcoin's source but I'd expect the clue to be in the name "segwit"; that the witness signatures are segregated from the block, meaning it's a different data structure to the blocks themselves, ergo no block size increase. If this is wrong then explain the details of that. If you don't know how it works then **don't have a strong opinion on it until you do**.


Combative, accusatory and unhelpful comments. What do you hope to achieve by this? Are you playing to the gallery here?

I don't think anyone but the most skilled of propagandists or most green of noobs can see Gavin Andresen as a bad actor. He was Satoshi's right hand man, he actually built Bitcoin. The only thing he ever did wrong was get conned by a magician, but the real reason for his demise was (of course) because he's in favour of bigger blocks.
One thing's for sure, this block size dispute has claimed a lot of important scalps, and judging by the last couple of years in social media and politics I wouldn't be surprised if state actors were on the side of small blocks.

I'm not an ancap but I disagree with the entire notion of copyright because I believe it is harmful.
1. As a free individual I should be free to do whatever I like with my own hardware as long as I don't hurt anyone else. Copyright prevents this, it's an excuse to intrude on my freedom to privately use the things I own in ways I see fit, using state violence to stop me if necessary.
2. Copying is easy. Back when copying was hard, copyright took very few freedoms away from people in order to encourage creation by the middle class. Nowadays copying is much easier, so we're taking away huge freedoms and conveniences from ordinary people. This is largely done in the name of false claims to moral rights.
3. Sharing with your peers is moral. People who prevent sharing or claim that it is immoral are preventing moral acts for their own greedy and selfish reasons, thus are acting immorally. (The moral claim around copyright is different to that of plagiarism, which is lying and akin to fraud)
4. Copyright allows the publishing industry to capture and own the culture, which should be public not a private resource. Every song from your youth, every book you've read and every character in those books, every part of the culture will be owned for your entire life. Private companies have levied a tax not just on what you dance to and what you talk about, but on your nostalgia. This was far worse before the Internet.
5. Copyright is great for funding and this leads to large and expensive works being the norm. This tends towards centralization of cultural power, it splits society into producers and consumers and the producers are funded by established powers. This leads to a top-down culture shaped by the establishment rather than a bottom-up one built by the people, a culture steered by corporate and government propagandists.

At the time Blockstream had completely dominated Bitcoin development and there were serious worries that they stood to make money from pushing Lightning over bigger blocks. The average transaction cost was tens of dollars and caused tons of high profile companies to drop Bitcoin as a form of payment. Experiments on other chains showed that most of the arguments against big blocks were technically weak.

The barrier to making mining hardware is the cost of ASIC design and fabrication, it's on the order of millions of dollars.

At 10 cents a kilowatt hour that's 5 petawatt hours per year. Global energy production is 21 petawatt hours per year. That's a quarter of global energy usage, about as much as the USA and India combined, almost as much as China.

The limit of mining will always be defined by the price of the coins being minted. Half a trillion dollars of energy demand is three times the cost of the Apollo program, every year. That's world-changing stuff.


It'd certainly push the price down to where mining wouldn't literally cost the earth. The reason why the price is $8000 rather than 0.08$ is because it's supported by the banking infrastructure. The price was minuscule before MtGox allowed people to transfer money into the exchange. And besides, all they'd (they being, most likely the European Union) need to do is force Bitcoin to move to proof-of-stake or be superseded by PoS currencies.

Point was that you don't need to generate the checksum until you find a match if you don't care about the last chars, because as per the diagram, the end of a bitcoin address is the checksum.
An address with checksum requires 2 more sha256 hashes than without, so it's about 3 times slower to match 2 chars at the start and 2 at the end than it is to match 4 chars at the start.

That's really not how it works. It's not how information works, it's not how the law works, it's not even a good analogy of this situation.
"Illegal numbers", as you say, are at least thousands of bytes in length. But let's say a 40x40 pixel image could be illegal, and at 3 bytes per pixel and a 90% compression ratio that's about 512 bytes, or 4096 bits which is a a nice round number. 
The space of all 4096 bit numbers is 2^4096 -- that's a number of bits with 1200 zeroes after it. If we imagine there are a trillion disk drives in the world, and there aren't, that's 12 zeroes, and each one is ten terrabytes in size, which they aren't, then that's another 13 zeroes. That's a number with 25 zeroes after it, you need a number of worlds with 1175 zeroes after it filled with disks full of random noise to accidentally stumble upon said illegal image.
You aren't going to randomly stumble upon a number that combines with another number to make an illegal file unless you're outlawing words of around 8 letters in length.

When I say this:


I'm talking about a possibly-nonpublic blockchain that banks in different jurisdictions use as a settlement layer. It could be bitcoin or it could be something semi-private.


I've actually done a bit of work in medical software, and can't see a use for any sort of blockchain in this area. The main requirements for a medical record system are taxonomy, identification, access control and auditability. A blockchain offers immutability, but mutability requirements in such a system are controlled by legal and insurance requirements, ultimately it's a tiny part of accreditation. We aren't going to get rid of medical-level software assurance and the associated bureaucracy, so adding a blockchain here solves nothing.
Here's the clincher though: It's important to keep records private and accessible only to people who need access to them, and you need to log each access to a document in case there's an investigation in the future. Spreading the documents out over multiple systems would actively hinder this.
So unless I'm missing something huge it'll never catch on in the medical space.

Each block contains the hash of the last block, so you can't just delete one out you'd need to either replace it, or replace all the blocks that came after it.
Replacing the middle block is not gonna happen: "mining" a block is done by changing a single number in the block's data and hashing the whole block over again until, at current difficulty, the first 80 of the 256 bits of the hash are a zero. For this, at current price, the miner is rewarded with $100k, and it probably costs them about $25k in electricity to do so. It'd be twice as hard to match 81 bits, four times as hard to match 82 and so on. As far as we know, replacing a block in the middle of the chain would not only take more money than there is in the world, it'd be impossible even if you turned all of the galaxy's mass and energy into computers and hashed until the stars went out. Let's say you found a way to do that, there's no mechanism to replace a block mid-chain, so you'd also need to hack every machine on the network and insert the bad data. Good luck with that!
As for replacing everything that came after it, that's possible. Bitcoin accepts the longest chain of blocks as the valid one (everyone works to make the same chain longer, so the longest chain is the most trustworthy), so if you had more mining power than the rest of the network you could potentially start at some point in the past and make an alternative history that is longer than the "real" one. That's the essence of a 51% attack.
An attack like that would cause a chain reorganization that, if longer than about 4 blocks, would undermine faith in the entire system. Bitcoin is secure as long as the honest nodes have more combined power than the attackers, and is secure largely because anyone who can attack it this way needs very expensive, specialist hardware that can earn far more money by simply contributing to the system rather than it can attacking it.

We're talking a future when we can use as much energy as you like, it's almost free, and the price of bitcoin is in the millions. Heating your house is free.
Heating the whole street is free, and because of the way the laws of nature work, all useful work, be it mining or moving or just thinking, all work produces heat as a by-product, so that's the default: heat pollution everywhere.
Cooling on the other hand is impossible, you need to move the heat to somewhere cooler. At some point there is nowhere cooler.
What I'm getting at is there's an upper limit to the amount of mining that can be done, even if energy is free there are real and practical limits to the amount of energy the human race can use before the oceans boil away, and mining has to be a fraction of that.
This might seem like far fetched nonsense but the price has gone up by four orders of magnitude, from 60 cents to over 6 grand, in the time I've been involved. If it goes up by two more it's going to cause a global energy crisis and accelerate the destruction of the planet, so we need to look at alternatives to proof of work before it's too late.
Continued exponential growth hits planet scale pretty fucking quickly, and people are no good at thinking on exponential scales.

We could outright ban mining and we could ban cryptos that rely on proof-of-work. Similar to how the internal combustion engine will inevitably be banned. Once this is on the cards Bitcoin would have to move to some other proof scheme or it'd be illegal in much of the world, suppressing the both price and its energy use.


Even with renewables there needs to be limits because the universe won't let you break the second law of thermodynamics; all useful work produces waste heat, and if people had as much energy as they wanted then heat pollution would be a huge problem.

This is interesting and has got me thinking... The thing that makes gold or anything else have value is that it's coveted by people. There are practical reasons for wanting something and there are emotional reasons for wanting something, but it's want that drives value and without the presence of a "valuer" things are ultimately valueless.
So I think "intrinsic value" makes as much sense as "objective opinion", and when people criticize bitcoin for not having intrinsic worth they're just holding the practical reasons for wanting something with higher regard than the emotional reasons, which is reasonable, and accusing us of wanting it for purely emotional reasons, which is not.

It's a poor example that everyone talks about, they are wrong.


What if you weren't in a different part of the world and you don't get into a horrible accident, but someone in that part of the world gains access to the global medical blockchain. They now have access to all your medical records. Having immediate access 
vs properly restricting access is the problem, and blockchain doesn't solve it. I mean we could all just put our medical information on Google Drive that all doctors worldwide could access and we wouldn't need a blockchain.


Local laws can override the blockchain, a blockchain can't secure the deeds to your house if a judge says someone else owns it. After that point the blockchain and real world are out of sync. You'd need some link back between the records office and the digital assets, and allow authorities to make changes to these links. And at this point you might as well just be registering sales with the authority itself, unless you want to keep people's property business secret from the state via a privacy-centric transfer protocol (good luck with government buy in here) then I don't see the use in this.


These are not created by untrusted parties, they're published by authorities. There's no real need to put this on a blockchain. They can just be published and signed, stuck on the web somewhere and everyone can take a copy, like they are already.


This is possibly a reasonable idea.


Again these are authorities, they just need to publish. People could index them on a blockchain though, that may have use for archivists and prevent Stalinist revisionism.


This is actually a pretty tricky scenario, you need a voting scheme that prevents people from either transferring or selling their vote. The right scheme would work within voting machines, and I agree that these should be public records. There's certainly work to do in this area, unhackable voting records would be a boon to democracy, though I'm not sure where a blockchain fits in here because timestamping or ordering of votes would severely weaken anonymity. Maybe one block per machine-day? Again, I don't know what that adds.
edit: don't get me wrong, I'm not a naysayer. I do believe in crypto and I think decentralized companies and smart contracts will change the world. The problem is we live in a time of ICO pump marketing bullshit, and it takes a lot of insight to see through it. I've just been around long enough to see through a lot of it.

This, IMO, is a design flaw in bitcoin's on-disk block format. To fix it we just need to employ a hashing algorithm that allows chunks inside a block to be shuffled without affecting the block hash, then if illegal data is found we just shuffle the offending block.
Removing the nonce and miners using block-shuffling to find the hash would be even cooler, it'd make embedding illegal data too expense to pull off in the first place.

Same as any other ban, by preventing businesses from using it legitimately and by locking up users who get caught using it. By seizing equipment and assets of people who break the law. The full violence of the state.
A dollar bitcoin is not going to cost the earth all of its resources, while a trillion dollar bitcoin would mean most of the earth's power is spent mining. Somewhere in the middle it becomes unacceptable, the only question is where that point is and whether mining will become enough of a problem that politicians will do something about it.
The price is mostly driven by money coming in to the system through legitimate channels, if those were closed then the price would be suppressed. That would be enough to make the problem go away. If bitcoin goes over 100k I can imagine PoW becoming enough of a problem for it to be vilified.

Yeah. Private blockchains in a trusted environment are worthless. The real value is when your database is spread across a large network of untrusted actors, none of which are the central authority.
When it comes to things like medical records it's easy to just have a single authority for a record and everyone trust that authority. The patient knows who their doctors are and there's no great profit in manipulating records in general (CIA/FSB aside).
On the other hand if you take a system of warring and/or untrustworthy nations and try to run a banking network on top of that system, it must be quite costly to ensure/enforce honesty and there must be a lot of risk associated with bad actors and economic espionage. Blockchain technology could remove a lot of risk here.

You mean the odds of the wrong one-time-pad decrypting a file that you didn't want? At least ( unwanted_files / 10^1200 ) to one! That unwanted_files was every photo and video frame ever produced, it's still unlikely to be more than 10 digits in length.


The number of image loading algorithms is pretty small, even if we estimate there's 1000 data formats / loaders, or even a whopping 10,000, four more digits doesn't really put a dent in a 1200 digit number. And that 1200 digit number quickly becomes a million digit one as the file size increases.
I remember when I first got into programming, I also had the great idea that you could compress files by storing indices and lengths into some irrational number. It turns out that the address of the information always takes up more space than the data you're trying to shrink; information doesn't ever come for free, it has to live somewhere, encoded in actual physical matter. That if you want to store X bits of information then you need to at least X physical switches, you can't extract anything more complex than "circumference/diameter" out of pi because that's all it is, it's just a ratio.
So when you start talking about data that is some group of offsets and lengths into pi it's the offsets themselves that hold the information rather than pi itself, they are the illegal data. And they're always big, they're always bigger than the file you're linking to; they are the file.
But this isn't even what's happened with bitcoin. Someone actually put questionable files into the blockchain. The fix for this is to corrupt and censor the blockchain.

Not really, it would just need the US and the EU to ban it. Most of the money is coming in via the likes of Coinbase, if they stopped supporting Bitcoin and other PoW currencies but still supported, say, Ethereum after the move to proof of stake, then bitcoin would go down in value and proof of stake currencies would go up.
If the price of a bitcoin was merely hundreds of dollars rather than millions, then mining operations would be much smaller. Small enough that they wouldn't be causing a global energy crisis.

This isn't about Bitcoin, this is about property law and it applies to Bitcoin as much as it does to gold or accidental bank transfers. Possession is not the same as ownership; being in control of something doesn't mean you are legally allowed to keep it. Transfer of ownership requires an implicit or explicit contract, in the general case sending coin from one address to another implies such a contract.
But this isn't the genral case, this is human error or technical malfunction - it's reasonable to argue in court that no contract was entered into. For the company to show that they legally own this coin they'd have to show that the transfer was part of some agreement or other. Do you think they can? Do you think a judge in Singapore - a deeply authoritarian place that banned chewing gum and has the death penalty for less than half a pound of weed - would buy into the anarchocapitalist cypherpunk idea that the blockchain rather than the state gets to say who owns something?
