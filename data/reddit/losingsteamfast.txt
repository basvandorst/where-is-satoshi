Oh shit. You're right. Sorry my tin foil hat was at the cleaners so buffet must have been using brain rays to scramble my thoughts. 
If he was investing why wouldn't he want to talk it up and increase its value? If Warren Buffett sneezes at a stock its cap increases by $100M. If he was holding btc it's in his best interest to create a frenzy where people want to buy in with him. Shit talking your own investment is the most retarded thing a public figure could possibly do.

That's called fear of missing out. It's an irrational mindset that leads to bad decisions (see:  2007 housing market crash). You should buy an asset as an investment because you have a reasonable expectation that it's presently undervalued or will grow to be worth more in the future. Not because "what if it blows up?"

Similar to a lottery ticket it's got a very small chance of success but a massive upside if it ends up panning out. 
Yeah I've heard the arguments for it. They're all framed around what could possibly be and not what will probably be. They're fun though experiments but not something you should bet your retirement on. I mean even if through some divine intervention you knew for a fact that crypto was going to be the dominant global currency in 10 years it's still a gamble to assume it will be bitcoin that is the winner.

If it has no practical use other than being able to potentially sell it later at a higher price then its speculative. 
Less than 1% of bitcoin movement is an actual retail purchase. It's all people like you who only hold it because you want to get rich by selling it later. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:18:48
If it does go up 10% it would be preferable to cash holdings. The problem is bitcoin is pegged to nothing of tangible value and has a history of extreme extreme volatility. For example it's down about 15% in the last 5 days. Theres no reasonable expectation that it will even hold its value much less go up. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 04:10:53
Lol! Dude you just explained to me how you're holding it because "some day it could be worth a million." You're literally a speculator, bud. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:24:25
If you had half a million in your bank account that you wanted to hide from the government how would you do it? You cant withdrawal it as cash, you cant purchase any physical assets, and you cant transfer it to a different currency. It has to stay as USD and it has to stay in a digital format. 
Pretty difficult to think of a way that you could move and hide the money without the government being able to track it, right? That's about what it would look like if bitcoin gets real regulations. 
It's silly to say bitcoin is immune to regulatory issues.

I majored in economics and got a job in securities trading because I'm really interested in markets. I am absolutely fascinated with the bitcoin frenzy. Its one of the only globally popular and unregulated securities being traded on this scale. I'm here because I love reading about it. I hold no bitcoin and still I check the price and valuation 10x more often than my own personal portfolio. 
To be clear I like bitcoin and blockchain technology in general. I think it was an ingenious invention and has a multitude of practical uses. But to sit here and say with any degree of certainty that bitcoin will be the future driver of global commerce is insane. it's still in its infancy. It's one of many thousands of digital tokens that is accepted virtually nowhere. It hasn't had to face governmental scrutiny or regulation. It has no tangible and intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:37:01

@_date: 2018-08-08 16:24:52


I agree. That's part of why it's not going to work - because nobody is using it as a currency. Everyone is holding it to try and get rich. 
Crypto is not diversification, it's a lottery ticket. 
You're 100% right about holding USD. You should keep however much cash you need for liquidity and put the remainder in something that doesn't depreciate. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:17:46
Crypto has had the benefit of being virtually unregulated. If crypto ever actually takes off as a usable currency you can bet your balls 10,000 pages of federal regulation will be a half step behind it. The anonymity will be gone and attempts to circumvent it will be greeted with prison sentences. The IRS will not miss out on tax revenue and the feds will not allow it to be used in money laundering. Bitcoin becoming a global currency, and bitcoin being anonymous are mutually exclusive. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 20:00:48
Its behaves like a security but it's not treated like one. Like not even close. For example a registered brokerage has to fully verify every single clients identity. They have to run them against the OFAC list to check and make the the client isnt on a restricted persons list or isnt associated with a sanctioned country.  
To hold bitcoin I need to have a computer. 
Regardless that completely misses my point because I was referring to the scenario where it changes from an unregulated security to a currency which is very very different.
@_date: 2018-08-09 18:53:44
Countries with strict anti-money laundering practices generally do better than wild west countries who have a lot of back doors and ways to hide money. I think you're underestimating the negative impacts of having an under the table economy where you cant effectively track money movement.

No it doesn't. What do you think intrinsic value means?
Something has intrinsic value if and only if someone would want it even if they couldn't resell it. Bitcoin is a collection of 0s and 1s on your harddrive. If that's valuable to you please let me know and I'll sell you a text document with whatever numbers you want saved in it.

John buys a limited edition collectors beanie baby. It's not really valuable and John doesn't really have a use for it but he thinks it's cool and he wants one. I think to myself well if John is buying one they must be great so I'll buy one too. Marry sees John and I buying one and not wanting to be left out she buys two. The price goes up since they're selling so well. Bill sees the price increase and popularity and thinks he should buy some too and flip them for a profit later so he buys 5. The price goes up again. Bill brags to Cindy about how much money he made and how he's going to buy 10 more. Cindy wants money too so she follows bills lead and buys 10. 
John was the only one who actually wanted a beanie baby, but 29 were sold. Replace beanie baby with bitcoin and that's basically how it works. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:41:13
That was a joke. 
I'm heavily heavily advising against short term trades to make quick money. Bitcoin is so volatile - it rose and tell 20% in the last half of a day-  that buying and selling the same day has as much accuracy as betting on a coin flip. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:32:18
It seems like you don't understand what intrinsic value means. You're confusing or with market value and general value. You're also describing the market structure which is independent from bitcoin. For example btc is anonomyous because nobody is tracking it yet. The only reason bank transactions are tracked is because the government mandated that banks either track them or get shut down. The same legislations could be applied to btc at any time. 
I also get the impression you dont really understand how speculative bubbles work. You described it as a safe haven because there is (currently) a finite number of btc.  That's basically the same thing as a company that releases a fixed number of shares and doesn't pay dividends. It's still 100% possible to overvalue it. Fixed shares doesn't guarantee future value. 
Your argument for bitcoin being the long term prevailing market winner is that it's "good enough." That's insane and in reality as of today it's plagued with issues and isn't in any way a stable means of large scale displacement of current payment methods. 
*IF* you couldn't trade bitcoin it would be worthless. I.e. zero intrinsic value.  That means it's entire value structure is based on a collective agreement of its value. If that collective agreement gets too bullish a bubble forms. 
Honestly I'm not trying to be a dick or anything but I'd read up on historical speculative bubbles to get an idea of how they work.

Jesus this is the dumbest investment community I've ever seen. 
Drugs have an end-user and are of extremely high value to the user. There are lots of different types of drugs but they aren't really interchangeable. I can't swap out cocaine for Tylenol so when cocaine becomes illegal it becomes more valuable because the cost to obtain it goes up. 
Bitcoin is has literally zero intrinsic value. It's one of many many many many many transactional mediums and if it wasn't valued at $8400/ unit it would be less valuable than a text document on your computer containing a random string of numbers. Virtually all of its usage is as a speculative asset. So what do you think would happen to the speculative value if the us or the euroblock said bitcoin transactions are illegal and all of a sudden no vender will touch it? What about if the government ordered a free and seizure of all bitcoin? Still think anyone would want to buy it at $8400/unit? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:32:35
Children seem to enjoy them. 
It's an ironic question because bitcoin has less intrinsic value than a beanie baby. If you can't trade bitcoin for something else then they're just numbers on a screen. If you have a 1000 bitcoins but we're never allowed to buy anything with them or sell/trade them then they are as useless as a random text file just taking up space on your hard drive. 
Nothing is stopping people from creating duplicates. Similarly nothing has stopped people from creating 10s of thousands of competing e currencies that have the same function. As btc.
Don't get me wrong I like bitcoin for a lot of reasons. I just think this frenzy is overheating things.

You're referring to the 1930s temporary ban on personally holding gold- telling citizens it had to be kept at the bank to avoid a run on the system? When the us government bought gold back from citizens at market value? Yeah little champ the intent was never to restrict or kill gold. It was just to keep people from running on the banks and imploding the entire financial system.

Basically what you're witnessing is a group of very novice investors bet it all on bitcoin. They have dogmatically bullish opinions on bitcoin and view it as a tool to get rich quick and satisfy all of their financial dreams. So far the bet has paid off and people like op have made 100s of thousands if not millions of dollars from small initial investments. 
If and when you ever read any news stories about bitcoin crashing or correcting its value be sure to come back here. Some people here have reverse mortgaged their house, gambled their life savings, and their kids college savings on bitcoin. It should make for some interesting reading

A few things on that because I feel like there's some misinformation being tossed around here. 
Deposits are FDIC insured. That means if a bank fails money you have with the bank is paid back to you by the government.  Guess who pays the premiums on that? That's right the bank is required to purchase insurance and pays millions to insure their deposits every year. Banks are also required to keep certain levels of capitalization and can only invest certain percentages of deposits. They are also required to disclose that information to consumers on a regular basis. 3 minutes on Google and you can figure out how big of a solvency risk a bank is.
Conversely crypto has none of those federal requirements or failsafes. Someone hacks into your wallet and steals $100k of crypto? Well though shit because none of the providers are required to pay you back one cent. Better hope the guys running it are nice and have enough cash to pay your losses. 
Regarding the "bailing out" comment let me explain what the bailout looked like. The government essentially said to failing banks "we will LEND you enough money to continue operations while you restructure your business. If you take the money you shall operate your business under your guidelines. If you fail to return to sustainability your bank now belongs to the government." And in reality the government made back every penny of tarp bailout money plus interest. This notion that banks just got a free sack of cash is completely misguided. 
Any other examples of how you think the rules are crafted in favor of banks?
