I just don't see any advantage parking your money in bitcoin vs. stocks, bonds, or precious metals. You're not going to see 1,600% gains in stocks/bonds/metals, so there's that, but that's because they're real investments based on sound principles not moon lambo pipedreams. High yield investment programs work too, until they don't.

this is why no one takes you guys seriously
@_date: 2018-12-01 07:36:28
okay i think this must be satire. nice job.

There's no way you can buy at 4k and become outrageously wealthy anymore. The days of buying $100 of bitcoin on a whim and discovering you're a multi-millionaire years later are over.

@_date: 2018-12-01 05:12:35
yeah this isn't happening 
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:21:18
Well, since this is apparently the first gas station to accept bitcoin I probably am. I'm meaning in a scenario where acceptance is more widespread, I suppose.
@_date: 2018-12-01 00:16:21
Probably because they don't want you sending cash through the mail. When I renewed my passport I had to buy a cashiers check from the post office. Pretty simple but definitely a hassle.
Still, this seems like a government bureaucracy problem, not a banking problem. They could just as easily setup a way to accept credit/debit cards than accept bitcoin. This also has the advantage of transmitting the currency they expect to be paid in, too, rather than forcing them to go through an intermediary to exchange to USD.

voluntary tax system... my sides.
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:42:24
You guys are ridiculous hahah
@_date: 2018-12-03 00:02:03
That's a good point. So this leaves us with:
A. Bitcoin is never going to replace fiat, undo central banking, etc.
B. Our monetary system will do away with loans, credit, and everyone will switch to transacting peer to peer. Basically just digital cash.

@_date: 2018-12-02 15:44:38
lol how is this corrupt?
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:40:26
So there's a lot of anger over banks charging fees, etc. in this community.
At the same time, people here seem to advocate for a totally hands-off, regulatory free environment for bitcoin and crypto instruments.
Imagine banks without any regulatory oversight. Imagine how far they'd go to take advantage of their customers. Imagine pre-2008 banking, but 100x worse.
How do you square this?
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:08:44
So you're saying we should take bitcoin exchanges/services out of the picture? Purely peer to peer transacting? I'm not sure if you understood my point, but it's this: imagine how bad banks would be without any regulatory oversight. That's how bad a monetary system built on unregulated crypto markets/exchanges would be.

Only in cryptoworld would the journalist who exposed massive fraud and brought down a company endangering thousands of people with their ineffective blood tests be called a snake.

PayPal uses money, bitcoin uses... bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:56:16
This is a great idea. Now people can kill time in the convenience store buying snacks while waiting for their transactions to confirm. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:09:44
Unless you somehow work for bitcoin and transact only peer to peer, bitcoin just adds its own network of middlemen 100x worse than what we already have. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:07:37
oh yeah, which is why gas stations let you pump first and then pay inside.

Well, okay. As a whole, we've agreed that money laundering is bad. To combat this, banks are required to collect information from customers who they do business with. PayPal wants to make sure that OP is who he says he is, and isn't up to anything nefarious. This isn't corruption, this is just part of living in a society and abiding by rules that the majority of us agree are a good idea.
If you don't want to provide this information, don't use PayPal. Use bitcoin the way it was originally intended to be used, peer to peer, without interfacing with any kyc/aml exchanges. You're not going to get rich, but you'll at least be sticking it to the man.
I know this doesn't jive with your world view, but there it is.

11/10 analysis. Bull run imminent.
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:31:34
coming soon
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:51:33
This is common sense, right? Like, if you sign-up for a bank account, they're going to ask you for some basic information about yourself. Unless you're 16 years old and this is the first account you've ever opened, this should be obvious.
@_date: 2018-12-01 02:48:05
Aren't you worried that if bitcoin ever actually takes off enough to threaten central banks, the government is going to basically just make it illegal? You could still do peer to peer transactions, probably, but exchanges and any fiat onramps would be toast.

Good time to accumulate real estate before it moons.
