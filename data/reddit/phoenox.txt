There were 22 months between the $30 peak and the $200 peak.
There were 8 months between the $200 peak aand the $1200 peak.
If it takes 22 months for the next run up, we still have 19 months left to go.
If it takes 8 months, we have 5 months left to go.
Since the second gap took about 1/3 of the time of the first, we could project that the third gap will take 1/3 of the time of the second, in which case the next peak will happen yesterday.

Imagine you had put 2% of your portfolio into bitcoins a little over a year ago when they were worth $10 each.  Now that the price is up to $600, your bitcoins are worth 120% of your original portfolio value.  Assuming the rest of your investments returned a little over 20% in this timeframe, bitcoins now account for half the value of your investments.
I could see selling a few to get back the original money that you put into bitcoins, or even half your bitcoins to take out a nice profit.  On the other hand selling out most of an investment that has been performing so incredibly well for it's entire lifetime in order to follow a rule of thumb investment principle seems a little too risk averse to me.
While the risk is high, and nobody shoud invest anything they are not willing to lose(as with any investment), the risk/reward ratio is fairly low.
For someone who found themselves in the position described above, would you really recomend that they sell most of their bitcoins?

You can donate with bitcoin.  There is a small link that says 'Other payment options'.  It goes to a page that includes several other ways to pay, including bitcoin.
There is a form asking for your email and address and stuff, but you can just fill it out with nonsense, they don't care.
I know because I just donated a bitcent.

After all the coins are mined the miners will be paid in transaction fees.
@_date: 2014-12-03 03:08:46
Right now the miners receive a 25 BTC block reward for each block plus the transaction fees for all transactions recorded in the block.
At the end there will still be a block every ten minutes, just the block reward will be 0 BTC per block, the miners will only receive transaction fees for the transactions recorded in the block.

A better implementation of this would be to have a mint print physical bitcoins.  Basically just high quality paper wallets, or coins with the private key hidden inside the coin, and the public key visible on the outside.  That way it would be easy to prevent counterfeiting, and if someone needed to send money over the internet they could just open up the coin(destroying it) and get the key.  Also, there would be no need for a central reserve.

This could possibly be a problem caused by bitcoin in the future, assuming it does become the single dominant currency.  I am not totally convinced that even then this will be a major issue.  Are you aware of any real world examples of cases where a slightly deflationary currency has caused a recession?  It is possible that once people get used to the growth in value of the currency that they will come to expect a decrease in nominal prices over time.
If this problem does become a major issue in the future there could be solutions such as making everday transactions using an inflationary blockchain while bitcoin itself could be used as a store of value, investment, or for trading between governments or large comapnies.

First, there is no saying that any of the steps will necessarily follow from the one before.  I would say that at this point we are still working on step one.  There is no guarantee that any of the other steps will even come close to happening, even if the step before is fully accomplished.
The reason I believe that the first three steps are necessary before we can even consider step four is because the central banks and big money men have way more power at this point than the elected representatives, and no accountability.  As long as these people control the source of money, they will control the political system, regardless of what their puppets are making noise about on tv.  Bitcoin is a tool that can make their power structure obsolete.
After that has happened, creating a truly democratic system will still be a huge job requiring the dedication of the masses, but would be much easier than now because:
1) public money would not have to be spent on servicing debt to central banks.
2) The money-men who are currently controlling the world from behind the scenes will be out of the way.
I believe some kind of government will always exist.
no government = power vacuum ---&gt; somebody will take control
The trick is to create a benevolent government.  Bitcoin in no way guarantees this, but it does provide tools that give traceability and transparency.
Banks will still exist, but if people insist on fair banks, fractional reserve banking will be impossible.  If you want to deposit money in a bitcoin bank, they give you an address to send your money to.  Any time you want, you can check that address to make sure your bitcoins are still there.

Step 1: Break the monopoly on currency currently enjoyed by central banks.  Create a environment of healthy competition in the currency markets.
Step 2: Defeat the old currencies in the competition to the point where nobody wants them and they are worth next to nothing.
Step 3: Repay previously unmanageable government debts that are denominated in a now worthless currency.  Free governments from the behind the scenes forces that have undermined the democratic process.
Step 4: Implement new democratic systems that allow provably fair elections and referendums.  Put the power back in the hands of the people.
We have a long way to go if this is ever going to happen.

What would you suggest someone do if they put 2% of their portfolio in bitcoins and a year later it is half their portfolio?
makes it hard to follow the 1-2% rule.

It might be doable if you split it into a large number of smaller transactions in different places.  Buy from many different loclbitcoin sellers, go to the bitcoin ATMs over and over...
This would take a lot of work though and still be somewhat unpractical.

One possible solution to many of these problems would be to make a minerless sidechain.
The system could be set up so that any full node could release a block once it had recieved enough unconfirmed transactions.  Proof of work would be unnesessary and the block hash could be any number.  There would be no block reward, but any transaction fees would go to the node that published the block.  This would create a financial incentive for people the keep a full copy of the blockchain.
It would need better block colision algorithms, ie: If a node has recieved two different end of chain blocks, A and B, if A contains all the transactions in B, B will be deleted and A will be the accepted block.  If both blocks have transactions that are not in the other, the two blocks will be merged into block C, which contains all the transactions in A and B.  C will be published as a new block.  There would be some tweaking nesessary to ensure that the blocks are released and accepted at a workable rate.
In the case of a fork longer than one block, the chain with the most blocks in it would be accepted.  
The miners would keep running in the main chain, but if there were a 51 percent attack the minerless sidechain would be immune.

The disturbing thing about this method is that it may be more efficient for low difficulty hashes than it is for high difficulty hashes.  If this becomes efficient enough to compete with the brute fore method currently used, it will undermine the bitcoin network's method of ensuring there is a constant rate of block generation.
Is there any way the network can respond to this to ensure there is still a constant rate of blocks generated?

With asics coming online you may find it would be more profitable to mine litecoins or another alt-currency.

One easy way to buy bitcoins is to go through localbitcoins.com.  You can get in touch with a person in your area who will be willing to sell you bitcoins without all the hassle of going through the exchanges.

The easiest and cheapest way is if you already have enough bitcoins to pay, then all you need to do is get the recieving address of the person you want to send bitcoins to, go to your bitcoin client and send them their money.  If they keep the bitcoins instead of buying local currency with it then the fees are very low.
If you need to buy bitcoins the cheapest way is to get an account at an exchange.  Each exchange charges different fees for brokering the transactions.  To research the various deals offered at different exchanges start at [Bitcoin charts](
The easiest way to buy bitcoins is to find a local bitcoin trader in your area.  This will be more expensive than the exchanges, but less work. [Localbitcoins.com](
If this is cheaper than Western union or wire transfers will depend on what kind of deals you make.

They would have to actually have the bitcoins that they were lending out.
That would be way less profitable than lending out dallars that they don't have.
