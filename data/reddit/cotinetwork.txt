Good time to sell and profit!

 In my personal opinion,it wouldn't be to long until exchanges will start using mBTC units . this should be done in around a year time.it's just a matter of convenience for the user.

The lack of transparency with Tether and Bitfinex arises from the these professional "audits" they get. Tether does not make any audits public nor available. Does that really equate to transparency? Also, if the company regularly undergoes professional audits, what's the point of bfx_drew stating that they are currently undergoing one?Tether's tokens, supposedly, are backed by the U.S Dollar in their bank account. When a user deposits U.S. Dollars in Tether's business account, Tether creates the matching amount of tokens and transfers them to the individual.
However, there's no way to know if Tether's tokens are backed because there are no public reports available from audits. We can only assume, but that may not even matter because Tether's tokens aren't redeemable as money..
If Tether's tokens aren't redeemable as money, then what's the point of depositing money in their accounts? If, all of a sudden, people stop caring about Tether, will they retain their worth?

When it comes to commerce use cases, however, the blockchain natively fails to provide much of the services traditionally demanded by consumers and merchants. Among these deficiencies are instant payments, for example bitcoin payments can take on average minutes to hours,and there is no complete mechanism for handling fraud or ensuring customer satisfaction.The blockchain by design is a low level protocol that never intended to directly solve all the matters in payments and, rather humbly provides the foundation upon which many features of the traditional financial system can be rebuilt. For blockchain technology to truly propagate to the payment space, services like credit and mediation must eventually be included.

Because than this would not be secured. having the signatures attached my consume 'power' but gives far more security. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:05:36
that's exactly what I meant about the SigScript

After SegWit activation, would deploying Schorr signatures also require a further fork (soft or hard)?
Also regarding the 25% efficiency gain in storage and bandwidth, does this (minimum) gain assume a certain level of adoption of SegWit on the network, and if so, have you got any estimates?
