I keep all mine on mtgox.  I haven't checked on it for about 6 months, but I'm sure they're taking good care of it.

I put all my bitcoins in my ass.  That way, anyone who gets them has to use bitcoins that have been inside my ass.  It's the secret of my success.

Thanks for submitting this marketing strategy to the Bitcoin corporation.  Unfortunately, the PR department has reviewed it and decided that it is a stupid idea, and we will not be using it at this time.  Better luck next time.

Downvoted for using the word "sheeple".

The Bitcoin corporation does not currently have any offices in Poland, but we are always looking for new markets to expand our business.  We look forward to working with you in the future.

The Bitcoin corporation is alive and well.  We are determined to provide innovative synergy for years to come.

Doesn't count when it's in quotes, so you can retract your downvote.

If I never see that word again on the internet, it will still be too soon.

Management has not yet decided on a new rate of price increase.  I assure you we will select a rate that is satisfactory to all our customers.

You assholes are both fired!

Too late.  Now you have to suck a stranger's dick.
@_date: 2014-11-29 15:06:06
Don't bother.  I'll just reject it.

You're allowed to say "fuck" on the internet.  You know that, right?
@_date: 2014-08-24 19:46:56
Quit your fucking whining.
@_date: 2014-08-03 01:59:12
Does that really apply to the monthly fee?

The official plan is that each bitcoin will eventually be worth 100 billion dollars.  This is guaranteed by Bitcoin Incorporated, so you can feel safe investing 100% of your net worth in Bitcoin.

I met with the board of directors to discuss this, and we are planning on raising the price of one bitcoin to $2000 on June 30 at 8:00 AM GMT.
@_date: 2014-04-26 16:43:12
I brought this up with the board of directors, and we all agree it is a bad idea.
@_date: 2014-05-06 01:37:24
You are a terrible person.

No.  We decided to cancel plans to use that chart.  Soon the Bitcoin corporation will publish the new price chart for the second half of 2014.
@_date: 2014-10-22 01:32:05
So will I.
