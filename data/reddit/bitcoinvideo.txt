When the extension was removed, both Kryptokit's devs and Chrome's staff seemed extremely good (on a Blockchain scale).

Education Coin anyone?

They're working with the SA exchange (IceCubed), lets hope they work it out..

An important guide..there must be one!
I'm not the lady in the video :)

Not at all. The story is from Forbes and it's stated clearly on screen (and in the video description in Youtube). It also corresponds with the Boring Report from Forbes. 
What would I want to make more Legitimate? Not sure what you mean. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 08:20:42
Not sure I follow. Do you refer to storing bitcoin on a phone?

I think the only interesting point made is that viable scale for a currency has fallen, at the end Evan Davies notes that people wondered whether Belgium was big enough to sustain a currency before it joined the Euro.

sorry, that wasn't the message I intended to send. I thought that since you've uploaded a lot of videos from the conference in Amsterdam, you will from the DC one as well.
I apologies if it sounded like that.

Mycelium or a double pass Blockchain would be safe (IMO).

I didnt hear of a second one at BCIT. Misleading title..
@_date: 2014-06-26 09:04:43
There is nothing new in the video, but it was published last night. I think it's important to show how mainstream media is turning in favor of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:31:57


that depends on how these people choose to use their money..

Not sure about this comment. The mentioned thread from r/Buttcoin dates after this video was posted. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 06:59:39
Personally, I agree. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:25:05
I agree, but it is stated that the footage is raw. I deeply hope post-production will be done well.
@_date: 2014-06-22 10:53:56
