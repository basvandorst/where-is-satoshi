Great video, very interesting. Thanks for sharing! One thing I've noticed on other gold/silver bullion related videos is a lot of people who are mentioning to buy gold and silver are also starting to say to buy Bitcoin as well. It's transitioning from "buy Gold and Silver to hedge against the USD" to "buy Gold, Silver and Bitcoin to hedge against the USD".﻿
