The group had become so polerised it took me a while to see through the FUD from both sides. Now the fork has happened, the air has cleared. BCC will probably still exist in a year, and BTC will be in orbit by that time. Meanwhile I can only hope the Devs don't allow such liberties to be taken again by the miners, who where obviously not initially envisioned to be multi million dollar companies with crafty mining gear

Bcash can be used for buying coffee, and I wish them success, but bitcoin has a lot of hard won infrastructure on its side, not to mention ASIC protection, and extra security for people's savings accounts. I'll continue to keep my current account separate from my savings account

Hahaha, I thought that was a clever joke....

Coinomi don't keep your coins, which is one of the reasons it's so good

I'm in same boat - though not as many as 12 hours.  - more like 2 or 3.  Mines just a Coinomi BTC / ETH wallet exchange using both Shapeshift and Changelly

Does anyone actually understand this?

Just cashed in a few. As soon as everyone can see the high, you will have a few minutes, after which you won't be able to sell them (while it's tanking (correcting) fast).  Any would anyone want to buy them off you after all during a correction. 
I sold at 5500, will now let it settle, then will rebuy. This is the first time I've done this and I don't recommend it by the way - very stressful. 
Back to HODLing for me

Nothing lasts forever, but if we agree we are still right at the beginning of market penetration, these ATH's are going to get silly
