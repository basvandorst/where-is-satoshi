@_date: 2018-09-13 04:06:55
Yeah he sorta missed that one..
@_date: 2018-09-29 17:07:25
Thank you for being awesome.
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:42:59
Great idea actually
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:43:48
Those BASTARDS! ;)
@_date: 2018-08-05 08:23:14
Dope wheels.
@_date: 2018-05-10 13:22:17
Great post!

Six of one, half a dozen of the other.
@_date: 2019-03-06 04:26:25
Smart chap.
@_date: 2019-03-03 06:15:40
Spot on.
@_date: 2016-11-02 03:12:46
Plus mofo 1
@_date: 2016-11-15 22:00:04
Nice lol!!
@_date: 2016-11-02 03:14:38
Bless you.
@_date: 2016-11-02 03:05:43
Three, bitches, three!
@_date: 2016-11-02 03:03:50
Thanks for this post. Made me laugh after a long, dumb-assed, vaguely humiliating day.
@_date: 2016-11-02 03:11:29
We're behind you. Thanks for the post.
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:42:16
Guy’s hodling out on us.
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:41:41
Ya beautiful. Nicely said.
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:52:06
Thank you for this post.
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:44:08

@_date: 2019-02-23 20:07:11
Any more cliches you can squeeze in there?
@_date: 2019-02-23 20:06:13
K this is hilarious, nicely played :)
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:20:52
More than just Jihan ofc.
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:17:36
Right, I'd like to see a person make this sort of claim in any non-absurd debate. Trying to dictate the terms of conversation is a childish joke. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:48:27
That’s nothing. I’ve quit for a year 3 times this week.
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:18:47
^ this.
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:49:51
I’ve gotten out forever at least a dozen times already.
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:18:08
Did anyone expect the institutions to ask nicely?
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:04:27
Bears are triggered. Bullish.
@_date: 2019-01-01 20:02:35
If someone is analyzing your poop you probably have bigger problems.
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:47:22
Coolest thing I’ve seen in awhile.

Clayton is a politician in the worst sense of the word. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 19:57:14
Great stat actually, TY OP
@_date: 2018-11-18 03:40:59
Gettin a bit worried about that short, friend?
@_date: 2019-01-19 18:50:49
Shhh, Ripple marketing machine will get you!
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:25:25
How could payment processors using Bitcoin offer the ability to cancel payments, or fraud protection?
@_date: 2019-01-01 20:01:25
It’s good to be skeptical but some of you guys are cynical af. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:09:34
More triggered bears. Wonder why?
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:58:33
Do your research before spreading ignorant guesses, please. The ETN is backed by actual “physical” BTC. It takes literally under a minute to research this.
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:23:27
You wouldn’t have to list in BTC. You would just need a unit converter at time of sale
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:34:51
It’s quantum crashing. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:58:47
Thanks, this is helpful. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:45:44
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:06:08
Heheh great comment. I could have sworn I’ve seen this before?
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:03:12
The scammers hurt us all. Right now the entire crypto sphere is on trial. So I’m all on board for being more proactive as a community about these things. Thanks for your post.
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:16:41
Fuck yes, sir. Respect.
@_date: 2016-10-17 07:24:49
His point was only that trend is up. Your point was "unchanged." He was right. Bubbles are irrelevant. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:55:24
Hodl onto that woman.

Suddenly train stations are the vanguard.
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:25:59
Agreed. Just finished book Antifragile. Would highly recommend to all in crypto space.

Fucking insanity.

Very wide ranging and I'm at bar, sorry. ;) worth the full read tho.
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:50:35
You. Are. The. Man.
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:00:51
Awesome post-cleared up a lot for so thanks!!
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:22:33
Nice, I’d buy one.
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:07:40
Another analogy might be of the guy who stood in front of the tank in T Square but yeah, point good either way.
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:13:34


An almost unheard of statement in these parts. Just wanted to thank you for it.
