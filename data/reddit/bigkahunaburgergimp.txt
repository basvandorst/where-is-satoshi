and a situation like this is exactly how it plays out.  Bitgo is not on the hook.  they aren't on the hook or having any real fingers being pointed at them.  
In a corporate world things like this this can happen pretty easily and pretty often.  SO much so that hold harmless agreements are around and standard.  If a customer requests that certain modifications be made, or security measures be eased, it's not just done with an email and an OK.  Agreements are generally signed off that the seller does not recommend these actions be taken and that the customer accepts full responsibility for any breach that may occur.
Blame will not fall to them because if it begins to get hot, they will make public that they were directed by the customer to make these changes and while they recommended it not be done, the customer purchased a product and can do with it what it wishes.
Figure it like this.  You contract me to design you a mailbox that looks like a Corinthian column.  You then ask me to come in and add a steel rod to it and tell me that you are going to use it as a real Corinthian Column to hold up your porch.  I say "I'll add the steel rod but this column shouldn't be used to hold up a porch.  Please sign this document acknowledging that I told you not to use it as a real column, that it should not be used to hold up a porch, and that you hold me harmless for any liability that may arise from using it in the manner you describe."
