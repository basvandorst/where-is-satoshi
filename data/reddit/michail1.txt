Hasn't Coinbase already banned most users that would have disagreed with TPP already?

Where did you get it for $149.  I can't find it.
@_date: 2014-07-10 14:30:28
You're right.  No one has that many coins.

Too bad it's 100BTC worth of transactions instead of a 100BTC Balance.

Sorry, but the 100BTC club means people WITH 100BTC (not that you have had 100btc in transactions since this could be done by simply passing it back and forth between 2 diff addresses (from one hand to the other).)    :(

What's funny about this is that I reported it publically and directly to them 2 days ago (emailing support and online chat).  I was told it was legit since the website is https: and actually at  .  Of course the support drone did suggest that I change my password (like that would help if I gave them access to my account).

Fake post -  SUPA convincing

Just use another exchange or Merchant.  (Bitpay? or LBC)
Don't complain to Coinbase while using your own account in fear they will ban you for trying to buy something as bad as Reddit Gold (joke - maybe?).  Might also be triggered as an MSB.  Gawd forbid the tracked coins from Coinbase being sent to Reddit is deemed controversal.

Thanks for your input.
The point that makes the comparison the same is that you can't trade in a 10oz bar for 10x 1oz bars.  The same (relatively) for physical BTC vs Digital coins.  (It costs more in trade to get a physical bitcoin than digital coins).  In the case of gold, I would have had to take 9.5oz in single small bars to trade out of the 10oz bar.  So, in my case, I took partial cash, but retained gold.  I was suggesting he might be keeping some digital coin from the cost and cashing in on the profit side of the coin.

Too bad there isn't a way to harness the power of all the noise from the miners as well.
@_date: 2017-01-04 01:26:13
Unfortunately, spotcoins doesn't list the bars.

Interpretation C -
IRS figures out which method nets them the most $ and therefore is the required amount to pay.
Seriously though....
You said 'sold' the physical for 1.35.  Did you keep it in BTC or convert back to USD or mix as you may have 3 (or more) possible solutions?
I am asking because of a similar question I had years ago with regards to a 10oz Gold bar which I ended up converting to 8x 1oz coins and cash.  It wasn't a huge issue since it was all under 10k and it ended up being a net loss in the end.  Just pointing out that people should see your question as if it were a higher amount than the proposed question.

Depends on which coin.  .5 BTC or 1.0BTC.  Depends on quality.
If 1BTC, then worth close to 1.5.  Just depends.
Always a risk to mail anything.  Trusting to ANACS, well, a lot of people send in a lot of coins to be graded.  It helps the value in that most want to buy graded coins over loose coins.

This is the coin missing from my collection.  :(
Please break it out of the dark cold safe every year to show us.
Love it.  Thanks for sharing.

Don't forget that coinbase will shortly after ban your account as an MSB.  Of course, they will say that if you register as an MSB and provide your registration information, they will then want a copy of your bylaws and want to talk to your Compliance officer, etc.  So, it works for a little while until the ban.

Go ahead and try it if you think it's that easy.
Hell, if it was that easy, then everyone would be doing it.
You don't honestly believe you need to tell them that you are moving from one exchange to another, do ya?  They look (automatically) where the coins they sell you are going to and where coins you might send them are coming from.
They will be nice and ask you questions like if you got them from mining, or buying from another exchange, etc.  They allow you to put your foot into your own mouth.  You can't simply operate as a Money Services Business without registering as such.  Coinbase probably doesn't care themselves; however, they are governed by banks which are governed by the government.  So, coinbase has to do their due diligence in making sure you follow laws, etc.  Government wants their share of your money as well as everyone else.

I've reported many of the accounts and the websites.
The scammer just keeps making new accounts.  Best thing that can be done is simply report them or post a link to the scam accusation after they post.
@_date: 2018-03-10 04:29:52
chris12209 and ericvbgt are both the same scammer trying to get you to go to the malware website so you lose your coins.
Scam sites with the scammer accounts are listed at:

This is a scammer shill account posting many malware sites to get your coins.   Don't download from electrocash.   Malware.

Is it not obvious that the real owner has access to the wallet since coins are still going in and out of it?  (Even after your post)
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:19:26
Cause they shouldn't ask the question anyway.  It's none of their business.   Even a real bank doesn't ask you what you're going to spend your paycheck on when you cash it.
And, a grocery store doesn't ask you what you're going to do with your change.
@_date: 2016-07-06 02:42:30
Sorry to hear about your brother.
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:03:18
I find it hard to believe you all haven't been banned from coinbase already.  I'm just one step ahead of you leaving them.  :)
