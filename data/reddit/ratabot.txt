Is it on ledger's list of official resellers? If not, be wary.
Luckily you can check the firmware is signed via chrome app and then pry open to check that nothing is suspicious. Downside is loss of warranty, but you can't be too safe when going outside of established channels.

When you setup your device, you'll get address codes from it to have the Bitcoin sent to. To put stuff on a KeepKey, you don't even really need it plugged in or near by once setup. When you want to take anything off of it is when you will have to plug it in.

Yes. TREZOR, Ledger Nano-S, and KeepKey are good Bitcoin hardware wallets to look into. Biggest challenge is finding one that is in stock and not going through scalpers!

Back it up to paper by writing it down.
The idea of a hardware wallet is to keep all key material away from anything that could be compromised.

And to clarify, if you have a wallet on your PC / phone that isn't hardware, it's good to use one based on a seed vs all random addresses (aka HD wallets) so you just have to use a series of 12-24 words to recover the wallet in case of disaster.

I did some deeper checks on the site: the whois record is suspiciously anonymous. Bizarre when you put an address on your shop.
The business address also points to a parking garage:

Ah yes, there's a guide here:

Don't see them on the list... they have quite a lot of tokens of all kinds! If you order through them, be sure to post here your experience. They seem to sell Nanos at the right price with free shipping!

It may say 16 BTC were sent, that's because Coinbase does not separate your money from all others. Internally they keep track of your balance, but they do not maintain independent addresses like that. Part of it has to do with how they maintain a separate hot / cold wallet.
You should notice in the transaction that most of the BTC was either sent out into a change address or a set of other address that you did not put in.
