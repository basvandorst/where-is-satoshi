Offering some things thats top of its class does not mean shit when that class does not provide a single service that anyone actually needs.  bitcoin is now ten years in and is still as useless as it was the day it came out.  Amazon offered a great service from day 1 and ten years in was well on its way to revolutionizing commerce and now twenty years in Amazon is largest E-commerce company in the world and has become almost synonymous with commerce.  Its founder is one of the wealthiest men on the planet.  In its ten year existence how has bitcoin evolved in a way that is actually useful for public consumption? 
 I will keep jerking off an internet marketplace that has literally revolutionized commerce as we know it because it provides an actual useful service, while providing jobs to hundreds of thousands of people.  But ya, keep jerking off fake digital money that nobody uses ����������

������������ how exactly has bitcoin changed the world to this point in time?  Bitcoin being a scarce asset doesnt mean anything because it's not an asset anyone actually needs.  There is nothing about bitcoin that makes it inherently valuable because of its scarcity.  I could create a coin and only make 100 of them; but so what.  The scarcity of bitcoin, or anything for that matter, does not make it valuable if people dont see a need for it.

Bitcoin is not even close to being amazon. Amazon actually offered a highly usable service from the very start. Amazon offered a very good service from the very beginning which morphed into an amazing service. That's why the company value expanded. Bitcoin still doesnt offer any actual compelling service or functionality. Bitcoin is more comparable to wework than amazon

������ bitcoin has massive demand? Where? ����

this is ridiculous.  You think people buy bitcoin, which can go from 20k to 3k in a year and there is nothing you can do about it, to hedge against banks where money is federally insured?  People do not buy bitcoin to hedge against banks.  The very early adopters bought it because they thought it was interesting new technology.  Most people since then buy it because they think of it as a speculative investment.  People dont buy bitcoin to hedge against banks.

What fucking third world dump do you live in that you seriously think your government failing is possible?

what people believe will happen is really not important.  If 1000 people jumped off a cliff believing they would fly would you follow them?  People believe another bullrun CAN happen but absolutely no one has any knowledge or insight that would allow them to accurately predict if it will happen.  If you have fun money that you want to gamble go ahead and do it, but dont do it based on what a bunch of people on here, with no more knowledge than you have, believe.
