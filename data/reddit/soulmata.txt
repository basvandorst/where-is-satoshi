40% of my family tree is illegitimate. I'd wager it's gotta be worse than that.

Nope. I sent 0.05btc for $0 last week, and 0.02btc for $9 last night.

It says right in the article that 75% of what this guy had wasn't seized and was considered untraceable.

Social engineering is the oldest, original and most important skill a hacker can develop. A social hacker is still a hacker. You can apply a wide variety of other labels too: scammers, phishing, whitehat, blackhat, et cetera, but ultimately the most famous hacks, the most important hacks, the most useful hacks: all had a social engineering component in them.

I'd wait for the fork, then buy. I think there will be at least some correction at that point.

FWIW: This is true. It's not quite every week, though. JEDEC standards enforce that consumer flash gear is rated to store data safely for a year without power. Still, a year is not so long, and a USB stick in a safe you forget about might very well lose its data after 18 months in storage.
Mechanical disks can retain their data much longer than that, but also are susceptible to damage from a head crash from a nasty bump or other sorts of failure. They are very prone to failure from humidity, too - out of 250 or so mechanical disks a company I worked for kept in storage, about 25% of them had died when we went to audit them after only 2 years. 
So really, you should store it on multiple devices. Even 3 is probably not enough.

There's no need to be a patronizing ass. "I'M SERR SORRY U DUN OWN ANY CRYPTO HURR".
You don't own the money in your bank, either - the bank does, and all you have is an IOU. They get to gamble with it and make money off it on a daily basis, but do you keep huge stacks of cash in your house under your bed? I also trust my bank more than myself to hold on to stacks of cash at the moment. For that matter, you also don't own the land your house is built on, you hold it in trust with easements from a dozen different entities that can choose to screw with you at any time. The point is that you have to balance between taking the risk yourself or putting it on others.
I have crypto in paper and hardware wallets, on exchanges and on mining pools. That doesn't change my previous statement.

Well, it seems you are very consistent in your views, and that in and of itself is good. I don't blame you for not having trust in any financial institutions. I don't trust my bank or my crypto exchanges either. They are ultimately self-serving and will protect themselves over you no matter what. However - I do trust them more than I trust myself **currently.** 
I suffered a house fire years ago. Many things I had there because I didn't trust them anywhere else were destroyed. Even things you'd think of as standing up to a fire, even things in safes rated for house fires (not the cheap ones on Amazon, but durable fire safes... even the expensive ones only last so long). So until I'm to the point where I know I can keep many sets of privates keys that I 1) won't ever lose access to 2) won't have fall into the wrong hands 3) aren't a single point of failure, I think my odds are still slightly better with a "bank".
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:46:18
I'm going to play devil's advocate here. I feel the chance of me losing access to my private keys right now is much greater than the chance of my exchange of choice screwing me over. I lose my car keys on a daily basis. I can't imagine the stress I'd feel having huge amounts of cash only a house fire or a neglectful spring cleaning away from vanishing.

I would not let winter air in... the temperature delta and rapid cooling of the air could lead to condensation build up.

but I mean what if you literally had no blood
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:37:46
Good for you. There's never a wrong time to start if you keep a level head. Don't cash out the first time it drops (and it will drop)!
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:16:35
What if you have a) no trusted relatives b) no blood ??
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:01:30
Whether or not you could do that feasibly doesn't make it any less illegal. If you have enough BTC to be caring about the financial implications, you have more than enough to risk audits, garnishing, or even worse.
My advice: Don't try to cheat the IRS. They will get their protection money one way or another. It's best to get a CPA or do the math and pay the taxes if you're going to turn crypto into cash.

In the majority of the U.S., you do not have a choice as to what ISP you use. And in many areas that do, if you're living in apartments, housing developments, condos, et cetera, quite often ISPs have exclusive deals with the management to disallow residents to use anything except their canonical Internet.
The last apartment complex I lived at, despite being an upscale place that rented for $2600/m for a 1 bedroom apartment, the lease disallowed you to use anything except Comcast for Internet.

That's kind of a disengenious argument. It would be more appropriate to say, for instance, "If you received a $100 stake in Apple on the day the company was founded, how much would you have today?". Same for all those companies. That's not even when those companies went public, but rather day 1, which is important.
When did bitcoin become "public"? A small group of engineers and math majors numbering less than 50 can't count, can it? When did it reach the same level of awareness that, say, the Microsoft IPO did?
Bitcoin will not ever show those returns again, and very few people held onto their coins during that process. There certainly are a number of Bitcoin Millionaires that were lucky gamblers, but that number is very few. Apple has made more millionaires than Bitcoin at this point in history, I'd wager, and it's unlikely anyone else is going to become a millionaire because of BTC at this point.

If you live in the U.S., this is 100% wrong and bad advice that will only lead to suffering if you end up getting audited. Stop spreading bad information. If you change the form of bitcoin at ALL - to cash, to goods, to services, to other crypto - ALL of that is taxable. You are giving people bad information.

Stop saying this. It's wrong and can get people into trouble.
