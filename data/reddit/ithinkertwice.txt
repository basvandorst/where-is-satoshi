There are 19.000 subscribers to r/bitcoin. When there are 50.000 subscribers do you think price will have gone down?
In reality noone knows 100% but it dont look like it will go down.

The big deal with Bitcoin is that its the worlds first non geographical currency. Banks allways increase the supply of FIAT currencies whenever someone takes a loan. This mean that FIAT currencies allways everyday decrease in buying power. Noone know how much Euros there will be in a year. Its impossible to tell. 
Bitcoin is the worlds first currency ever in human history in which the supply is known by everyone in the world 140 years ahead.
Its designed to keep its value or even increase in value as more and more people use it and thats whats happening now and probably the next 10-15 years.

Ask him if he know exactly how many USD/Euro or any other currency there are? Ask him if he knows how many of those there will be in 10 years. Now tell him, that with Bitcoin everyone in the world knows exactly how many there will be in 140 years. Its the only currency in the history of the world that humans can now 140 years ahead how many there ever will be.

Nice guide.
I don´t think a cryptocurrency should be the only currency a country use. I´m also not sure what the world would look like if everyone used a cryptocurrency. Not sure it would be a better world there would be other kind of problems.

And your post is the kind of post that signals that you work at paypal, visa, banks, gold company etc afraid of Bitcoin since it allows people to do things with their money for free or maybe want to buy in cheaper.

How do I know I can trust my printer to safely print a paper wallet?
You need to work on building up the trust, get to know your printer, print a couple of beers together. Make sure your printer is happy and have lots of color. Dont yell on the printer when its not working, when it might be your fault. If you follow those advices I´m sure you will be fine.
Joke aside, good question.

Bitcoin can even do 2 party transactions, leaving out the third party.
You send the money to an adress the require your consent and the stores consent to move any money to their or back to your adress. They see you have deposited the money so they send the product. You get the product and now you can enable them to get the money. If you do not like the product (its damaged) you send it back as agreed and they can now  let you get your money back.

This is a excellent idea. 
I can see companies using it for really important emails, knowing that spam with viruses, fake senders etc will not get through, since the fee is to high.
Wikipedia had hundred of thousands of naysayers like lordgilman.
