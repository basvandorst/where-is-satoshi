That’s kind of like saying the US government could ban the internet.  Sure they could, just like they banned alcohol during prohibition.  They can ban it, they can make it illegal but the cat is already out of the bag.  Also kind of like 1933’s executive order number 6102 where the US government forbid the hoarding of gold coins, gold bullion and gold certificates.  (Yup, it’s another similarity with gold.  Governments can try to ban what they want.). Ironically, most of the time when governments try to ban things that people want it becomes more valuable.  
China, as you point out, shut down their exchanges.  China, the largest market for bitcoin.  What happened?  The price dipped a bit, then rose to new heights.  The US, China, Russia, Germany, Etc., could all ban bitcoin and it will still have value as long as people decide it still has value.

I suspect this will happen if bitcoin truly starts threatening banks globally.  Ironically, this would lead to massive need for people to actually be able to spend their bitcoins in the real world, which will only increase the number of places bitcoin could be accepted, which would only increase adoption.

Devils advocate:  if you bury your gold in the back yard and then forget where you buried it or someone steals it and you have zero ability to retrieve, is it inherently flawed?

He’s not missing anything.  He’s right on every front except the one he didn’t talk about, which is Bitcoin as a store of value.  I think anonymous money is an issue governments are going to want to tackle. It’s clear that banks are adopting Fintech in order to compete and stay alive.  Paying friends in the BofA app with the touch of a button is a clear reaction to the threat bitcoin poses to banks.  Going the final mile with digital payments is critical for them if they want to fend off the unique value of btc.  I thought he was pretty insightful.

They could make it illegal, but they can't deny access to it thanks to the distributed network and anonymous nature of bitcoins. 
The IRS was granted access to all sale transactions over $20k from Coinbase. Regardless I've paid my taxes every year I've sold my BTC. I don't mess around with the IRS.

No economy should adopt a fixed quantity deflationary currency.  But couldn’t Bitcoins live next to the currencies of the world as a store of value, and a means to exchange that value into any other currency with minimal fees or government or corporate intervention?  More like digital gold.

Financial institutions are going full force towards leveraging the blockchain.  The question is whether bitcoin will be the blockchain of choice.  I used to think it would be, now I don’t think so. Banks are creating their own blockchains, with their own networks between themselves.

Regarding point number one, why can’t bitcoin live next to traditional currencies instead of replacing them. A unique feature of bitcoin for transactions is that it can instantly translate for the current exchange rate.  I don’t see bitcoin replacing fiat currency any time soon, but I do see it living right next to it as a way to convert to any currency as needed on the fly. Shops don’t need to price in bitcoins.  They price in the local currency and bitcoin automatically converts to the current exchange rate. It facilitates digital transmission of fiat currency for a digital world, ideally without the fees that encumber other digital transactions.
Regarding point number two, won’t there come a time when the price does stabilize?  The price of tulips stabilized eventually too.  I’m not saying btc is a tulip bubble, though it may be, I’m saying that eventually the value of things tend to stabilize.

Yes, institutions are completely on the blockchain bandwagon. They understand this to be true.

The advantage that the federal government has over Bitcoin right now is that there isn't a single company large enough to lobby for legitimizing (or at least not destroying) virtual currency.  Without politicians on our side espousing the benefits to the US and the world of virtual currency, I'm afraid Bitcoin is doomed.  Explain how I'm wrong?

Yes.  A little story:  I was recently in Europe, ran out of Euros and my ATM card wasn't working and I thought, I've got Bitcoins, I'll just trade some of those in for cash Euros.  Nope.  There was no easy secure way for me to do that.  That, along with simple foolproof secure storage and usage need to come about before we will get to the next stage.  If it requires an explanation of how to properly use it, it's still too complicated for mass adoption.
@_date: 2016-06-18 07:15:00
Yes, it should exist!  I was stuck in Europe with an ATM card that wouldn't work, would have loved this.

I really struggle with this idea of being backed by something.  Why does gold (not gold stock) have value?  Because people decide it has value.  Sure it’s somewhat scarce and somewhat pretty, but there are other rocks that are somewhat scarce and somewhat pretty?  
Why does bitcoin have value?  Because people decide it has value.  Just like gold, in fact they could call it digital gold...it is a store of value.  Also like gold, there are other rocks (crypto currencies) that might become the new favorite, and yet people choose bitcoin.  People find it valuable because it’s scarce, backed by the distributed nature of its blockchain.  People find it valuable because of the concept that it is anonymous, that governments can’t take it away from you, and that it’s easily convertible to currency anywhere in the world should one need to convert it.  
I keep hearing economists and bankers mostly saying that it’s a scam until it becomes backed by something else.  Why can’t it exist as it’s own entity apart from everything else.

For Bitcoin investors, might it not make sense for a company to offer a fully insured private bank?  (Insured against theft and government seizure.)  There needs to be a dummy proof way to confidently store Bitcoin so the masses don't need to give it a second thought.  You'd obviously have to pay fees and give up privacy in order to do that.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:38:28
No.  If you had bitcoins when bitcoin cash became a thing you could have had bitcoin cash.  
@_date: 2019-01-08 16:26:23
A couple years ago I was in Paris on vacation and was running low on money and thought, I’ll try to locally cash out some of my Bitcoin.  It was hard enough that I gave up and went the traditional bank route for more funds.

I have had the opportunity to speak with about a dozen people who are executives at major banks in the US about bitcoin over dinner.  The impression I get is that they don’t fear it, but they do remain dismissive of Bitcoin. (But not of the blockchain.)  They all have a similar talk track too, which is that the fundamental problem with bitcoin is that it isn’t tied to some store of value.  Without that they say it’s impossible to value. They say if it was pegged to the dollar or gold they would be less skeptical.  I believe their logic is flawed, they believed mine was and we left it there.
They also said, why should bitcoin have any value at all when tomorrow someone could create a better crypto currency?  
The final point they made was that the banks are paying attention, and that all the major banks are big believers in how the blockchain can transform banking.  They are all working on their own blockchain solutions.  
This open letter presumes they aren’t paying attention.  They are.

Interesting perspective about the hierarchies that were built to ensure some form of trust.  The premise is that the current hierarchical structures aren’t scalable enough for our new world, that the blockchain effectively reduces the need for trust hierarchies.  I do question this though.  It seems our current financial system, hierarchies and all, are extremely scalable.  Am I missing something about the scalability of our financial institutions?
I do agree though, that bankers will say, “Why would you rely on a crypto currency when banks can enable transactions with all the implicit and earned trust that one would need?  
Meanwhile, bitcoin and the blockchain is like the Wild West...much more dangerous when talking about serious money.

Why not keep it with Coinbase? I have one bitcoin, planning on buying more.  Right now the one btc is on Coinbase.  Is it because they could do what Mt. Gox did?

It can only be divided to 8 decimal points.

I'll upvote you, I appreciate the different perspective.  I think the real desire for Bitcoin for wider audiences will start in developing countries as a safe and free way for poor family members to receive money from their wealthier relatives, similar to the way families in Mexico receive money from their relatives in the U.S.  Similarly, in countries with less stable currencies or governments, the accessibility of bitcoins will make it easier for people to hedge their savings to something that is more global in nature.  The privacy and security aspect also means it may prove to be a safer store of money than keeping their home fiat currency in their local bank, and possibly safer than precious metals and stones.  But right now, Bitcoin is still not super easy or convenient for newcomers.  There is a learning curve.  
People didn't need email either.  Snail mail accomplishes the same thing albeit in a much less efficient way.  My first email address was a bunch of numbers with an @ compuserve.  It wasn't very convenient, it was hard to remember my number, let alone anyone else's.  I remember my Grandmother saying, "Why would anyone want to write or read a letter like this when you can just send them a letter?  What is the big hurry?"  Over a short amount of time it obviously became much more convenient and easy, email exploded and the rest is history.  Bitcoin is still kind of hard.  The language of Bitcoin is still very technical and not very accessible to the masses, but that will change rapidly.

You could have congratulated me when I leveraged up and shorted the S&amp;P 500 right before the housing bubble bursting tanked the stock market.  Unfortunately, I held on to my short position too long.  The government intervened more than I could have imagined and I lost my massive profits and broke even.  Anything can happen...no congrats from me until I know he has cashed out his winnings.
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:44:55
There are no fundamentals beyond the fact that there are a finite number of bitcoins and that people are willing to pay some amount to have them. They could be worth a penny, they could be worth a million dollars.  
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:19:41
I'm not creating FUD, but I'd like the price to fall back significantly so I can buy more.  
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:35:57
This bet both scares me and fascinates me.  I can imagine a scam that one could run by doing this.  I'm not implying that OP is doing this, just thinking through the idea of being terminally ill, taking out a huge loan and then investing it in bitcoins.  You then transfer the funds offline to a hard wallet or a paper wallet and place it in a safe deposit box.  You leave instructions to a single trusted family member to deny knowing anything about the bitcoins, and you store the wallets in a safe deposit box that only they can access at some point in the future after you die. Upon death, bankruptcy is declared, the coins are "lost" and the debt is discharged.  Some time later, the heir to the bitcoins retrieves the btc and is able to spend.
Would this work?

I started buying one Bitcoin a month when it was in the 200's.  I stopped as soon as it jumped to the 300's.  I'm kicking myself for stopping my dollar cost averaging then.  I also kick myself about not trusting my instincts more.  There are a couple times in my life where I could have bet big, where I was very confident I was right, and instead I bet relatively small.  The future of Bitcoin is one of those bets.

The base level of the next tesla is $35,000.  If, as he suggests, adding your Tesla to the self driving fleet can essentially make it so anyone can afford a Tesla, the concern about who uses the car, or how they use it goes away.  
Also, I think you are missing a fundamental part of what he is saying.  People won't be driving these cars around.  These will be fully autonomous cars, where manual driving can likely be disabled.  These cars will be 10x safer than manual driving cars...insurance rates will actually go down.  It should also eliminate your concerns about general abuse, tire and rim damage, parking damage (there is no need for these cars to park), and reduces the likelihood of dents and scratches compared to a traditional rental car as we know it today.  
The one concern I agree with is interior damage, which would be annoying.  
@_date: 2016-07-21 13:55:45
I probably wouldn't either for the shiny and clean reasons, but I'm convinced this will work, just like AirBnB has proven to work.  The idea of maximizing the utilization of a car which is normally only used 5-10% of the time is intriguing.  
If the car essentially pays for itself, the resale value really doesn't matter.
