Oil has a zillion uses, many of which can't be replaced by non-petroleum options without significant additional expense and complexity, if at all.  Modern society is going to need a steady supply of petroleum for the foreseeable future.
Bitcoin has a handful of uses which are all generally covered by existing options.  Switching to bitcoin for these uses usually comes with additional complexity and risk.  Nobody actually needs bitcoin.

It won't.  This whole thing seems to hinge on hoping consumers are unaware of or willing to ignore that aspect.  The electricity cost doesn't directly matter to 21 since they're not paying your power bill.
Lucky for them, a lot of consumers are that sort of stupid.

You can't guarantee a "win" without taking a position on both sides of the bet, and you can have a net loss easily.
If you put down $100 on both, you have 2 bets.  Your total bet output is $200.
If Floyd wins, you get $140 back, because you lose the $100 you put down for Manny.  You've lost $60.
If Manny wins, you get $280 back.  You still lose the $100 you put down for Floyd.  You've gained $80.
This approach dampens both the potential loss and the potential gain.  If either bet was done individually, the potential loss would be $100 if your chosen fighter doesn't win.  The potential gains would be $40 and $180 respectively.
So, no, you cannot guarantee a return (much less a 40% return) because you still lose the money you put down on the guy who lost.

That sounds like what we do today, "but with bitcoin."
You already connect to someone speaking a protocol - TCP/IP.  The traffic is then routed in a largely carrier-agnostic fashion from there.
"But ISP censorship!"...well...can you count on your ultra-religious neighbor to not block traffic to sites they consider immoral?

A fundamental principle of VC is to shotgun money at lots of things and make your money back on the tiny percentage that explode into something real.
VC investment alone isn't much of an endorsement of any specific thing.  Does no one remember the late 90's and sticking .com on everything to get a giant pile of VC cash for booze and hooker parties?

It still screams "solution in search of a problem" to me.
Best info I could find on a quick search for Super Wifi throughput is 20mbps down / 6mbps up.  I'll stick with my 100mbps down/20mbps up wired connection tyvm.  Even if I do have to deal with Comcast customer support once a year or so.
Wireless networking, especially area-blanketing / not a tight point-to-point beam, also tends to have latency and jitter problems.  Increasingly so as the number of nodes and crosstalk increases.  Wired is always faster and more reliable than wireless at the same level of technology development.  Both systems need to detect small, high frequency changes in an electromagnetic signal state.  Wireless has to deal with a hell of a lot more noise by the very nature of the transmission medium, which means the signal decode rate on wired consistently stays ahead of wireless.
Just lol at the thought of playing a twitch reflex online game while my router is hopping connections to optimize penny shavings.

Can't do it, that'd need a throughput of 23 TPS (2,000,000 txns / 86400 seconds in a day), Bitcoin can only do 7 TPS and that only with optimally sized transactions.

Do tell how you'd handle transoceanic internet via peer mesh.
Or even across low population density areas, like a good chunk of the middle of the US.
Before you reply "satellite!", who's paying to put the satellite up there?  And maintain/operate it?  And manage the ground stations that talk to it?
Before you say "microsat, they're cheap enough to crowdfund...and you don't NEED a big dish to talk to a satellite!", well...sure...if you don't mind piss poor bandwidth.
And of course all the satellite options of any kind mean absolutely nasty round trip times versus traditional long-range copper and fiber links.
If you want a bunch of un/poorly-connected island "internets" formed among people who live near each other, knock yourself out...but it would be a pale shadow at best of the Internet as we know it today.
I'll stick with the ISPs, thanks.

How will these assessors actually assess risk to any truly accurate degree for the individual?
What if you're actually a terrible mountain climber but Dunning-Kruger effect makes you think you're awesome, so the assessor doesn't have an accurate picture of your climbing experience?
What if you have an as-yet-undetected coronary condition that would be triggered into a critical state by the low oxygen conditions encountered at high altitude?
I could go on for pages of theoretical risk factors for just about any scenario that would be difficult or impossible to assess on an individual basis without ridiculous batteries of tests and analysis that no reasonable person would subject themselves to.

Redundancy is expensive.  Even when the redundancy directly supports a revenue center, it's very easy for the people in charge of the money to say "2 is good enough".  That is, if they OK spending on redundancy at all.

Unless someone discovers a fundamental flaw in SHA256.  What you say only addresses the problem of faster SHA256 computation.

A few merchants (notably including a former moderator of this sub who was run out on a rail by people accusing him of making up numbers,  because surely a guy who had been deep in the community for years was actually a long-game troll and he wasn't just reporting on his own experiences) have noticed there is an ongoing "cost" of accepting Bitcoin due to the negative stigma Bitcoin carries.
Through A/B testing - presenting some users with one version of a payment page that includes a Bitcoin option, other users a page that is identical except lacking that option - it has been reported that the with-Bitcoin pages have a tendency to drive down completed sales.  People may browse, and there may be a bump in total visitors due to links being passed around in pro-Bitcoin communities, but the actual sale conversion rate often goes *down*.  The Mozilla Foundation also noted this behavior when they added Bitcoin as an option to their donations page, so it's not just the retail context.
Bitcoin is considered sketchy by many people for a wide range of reasons.  Bitcoin has a serious image problem.  Accepting Bitcoin means bringing part of that image problem on yourself / your business.

Which math in Bitcoin is so unique and magical to warrant such a bombastic claim as "most profound mathematical object humanity has ever created"?
The public key cryptography, which has existed for decades?
The SHA-2 hashing algorithm, published by the NSA 8 years before Bitcoin existed, and also was the latest evolution in a long series of cryptographic hashes that predate it by many years?
The digital signing, which has also been something used in many forms for years?
Tell me, where is the profundity?

It sure is great how people who think that everything can be improved by inserting market forces (otherwise, why exactly would you want all your IoT devices to be continuously negotiating prices for everything?) like to whine about negative opinions.  Apparently markets are fine as long as it's not the marketplace of ideas...seems there is demand to "regulate" the negative.

And that 7 TPS is pretty much only if every transaction in the block is minimally sized (single input, single output).  Many transactions have multiple inputs.
I believe I saw some math a little while back based on the average transaction size over a range of blocks, and that came out to more like 3-4 TPS max.
You can increase the max throughput by increasing the max block size or decreasing the time between blocks.
Both would make the blockchain grow larger faster (more disk space needed).  Both have tipping points where you'd start to affect the ability of the network to agree on which chain is the "real" one, leading to a higher chance of orphaned blocks.  This leads to more opportunities for double spends and an increasing inability to trust transactions that don't have a significant number of confirmations.
