What I don't understand is how people ignore the large number of problems with bitcoin then wonder why people don't want to use it.
Setting most of them aside and the "no chargebacks" has attracted a large community of scammers looking for easy marks.  Given that lots of people have lost bitcoins to various scams do you think that those people will ever use bitcoin again?
Then there are the life savings fools who bought into bitcoin when the price was high and are holding on hoping that the bitcoin price will recover.  Good luck with their poor investment choices.

Sounds like a great place to buy drugs, child porn, guns and hire assassins; the primary use of bitcoins.

Stop pricing bitcoins in USD.  I don't understand why you would do anything else.

If they are a currency they have their own value and anything else is an exchange rate.
Alternatively they could be measured in the number of erect cartoon dog tables they could buy.

I've swapped all of my giftcards for bitcoins and used them to buy the entire world supply of gold.  Watch me manipulate the market at will.  I'm the invisible hand that strokes the table.

The probability of converting $5000 into $4000 or less with bitcoin is 100%.

Bitcoin extremists are pretty entertaining, so are the crazy rigs that people have built and it fact it's been a pretty interesting ride.
In fact looking at her article I don't see what the issue is as she's just discussing what is going on.  There has been very little discussion of the transaction spam attack clogging up the network.  No one seems to be considering that this a test to see what would be needed to optimise the attack and cripple transactions for months.  The side effect could be a blockchain that rapidly approaches TB in size.
I also can't understand why people have a problem with the bitcoin price.  If you use it as a medium of exchange the value based on other currencies doesn't matter.  Worrying about the price is for speculators, the ones who contribute nothing to building a bitcoin based economy.
Speculation and bitcoin extremists have scared away serious mainstream interest.  Don't get excited if CNBC does a bunch of articles as they are a bunch of financial clowns looking for viewers or clicks.
As for r/Buttcoin you shouldn't be so serious about bitcoin that you can't have a laugh.

I can't use my grandma's SS number as I've already sold her out to the feds.

His coffee table has secret messages encoded into it.

The best thing is they can offer bitcoin discounts knowing that no one will take up the offer.

The shouting down of anyone but the true believers suggests something?  Maybe bitcoin is anti-intellectual?

There doesn't seem to be a strong mining community.  Mostly mining is broken unlike the early days when bitcoins were $5-$27.  You see more of the technical discussion at bitcointalk.
The fact is the bitcoin price was escalated by the mtgox fake trading bot and it's in the slow fall down towards the market price.
Generally the discussion here is too "pump and dump" and not enough reality.

Bitcoin is worth nothing.  That's less than $4.

Too bad the only people that want bitcoins are people that you would never want to do business with.

No one needs to make this place look like it's full of greedy conspiracy theorists, it is.  Same with change tip it's just a superficial bitcoin advertisement driven by greed dressed up as charity.
The posts with discussions about cancelling all debts, ending fiat and fanfiction about 100% bitcoin adoption becoming rich put people off bitcoin.  It's all just fantasy.
If bitcoiners can't bring bitcoin to Earth there's no point sending it to the Moon.

Current bitcoin value $0, future value $0.  The only two data points that you need.  You don't even need to log scale the chart.
@_date: 2015-04-09 05:56:06
There is a difference between price and value.  You should also consider future value which will revert to about 10k bitcoins per pizza.
If you are sensitive to the price of bitcoin you should consider diversifying your investments.
