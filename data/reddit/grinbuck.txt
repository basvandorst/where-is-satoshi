Started trading bitcoins very recently on BitStamp. Put in 2Btc a couple weeks back (Avg: purchase price $2400 USD). Sold it for $2925 - was very happy about that! At that point bitcoin was moving kind of sideways and Litecoin seemed to be on the way up - bought 130 Ltc using the funds I had made. Over the next few hours and days, Ltc rose to $48 or so and I sold it for a (handsome??) profit of about $250. Then realized I'd have made more if I'd just hung on to my bitcoins. Purchased bitcoins again but now I have only 1.73 vs. the 2 I put in a week or two ago. I have $6k USD though. Still confused about whether I made a profit or a loss! Profit in USD? Loss in Btc??? I guess it's maybe not a great time to try day trading!

Wow! Wish I had had that kind of money to invest in Bitcoin at $2700!
I'd like to be able to say that I'd have at least maintained my capital rather than frittering it all away but I FEEL you because I'm struggling with the same problem (though with a much smaller amount).
This latest bull run has been so crazy that I saw my BTC simply shrink from 2 to 1.2 over a week because I was trying to TRADE - sell high and buy low - during this period. Problem is, you can only sell high. The lows are not happening. And so each time you buy back, you buy back an amount which is slightly less than the original. Again, in USD, as you say, it's kind of deceptive. My total USD value has gone up but much lower than what it would have done if I had simply let trading be and held on!!!!!!!!!
