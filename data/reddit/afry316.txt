Hopefully this was purchased with cash. If not, seriously consider cutting at 50%. This is going to be a bloodbath.

1 seashell is still worth 1 seashell - whats the point exactly? Shouldn't you care what BTC buys in terms of goods and services?

You make a compelling point.

It was a genuine question and  [cm9kZW8K]( provided a decent answer. The down votes really indicate cultish like behavior - yikes

Which proves Bitcoin is not being used as a currency but rather a highly speculative bet.

Interesting, but they aren't all scams. They are just undeveloped/immature.

How could this be true if many of the other cryptos are bitcoin replicates with hyperparameters tweaked?

If you want a real investment go put a down payment on a duplex, fix it up and rent it out. Capitalism rewards value-add assets, putting your money in a digital asset does nothing for the economy, you or anyone else.

Well yes I agree with that. Most of developers/founders need to go to jail for fraud. Some of these coins were outright fraud.

Gold is scare due to the physical constraints, but Bitcoin is scarce because of the consent of the majority of network participants, right? If that assumption is true, then couldn't a central bank's holdings be eroded if network participants are convinced to adopt new bitcoin standards (ie increased supply)? The same could be done with gold, but it requires a huge amount of resources to mine new gold.

Well Central Banks themselves have an incentive to increase supply, so do governments and adversaries of the United States (ie China, Russia). For Gold, there is a way to synthesize it, but the cost do so is far more than is required to mine it. So you'd need a cheap way to synthesize Gold before it will have any affect on its value.
The more I think about Bitcoin's supply restrictions the more uneasy I am. I love its decentralized nature, but look at how easy it is to convince people of falsehoods. Convincing 51% of the nodes to make XYZ software update doesn't seem like a very hard task. All the government has to do is say we will collect taxes in this new update and people would switch over in droves.

But the assumption is being made that miners and the nodes understand economics and wont be corrupt themselves. Miners would have an interest in increasing the supply, because they'd be the first to use the newly minted coins. The first actors to receive inflated currency get the most benefit as prices have not adjusted to the new supply (see primary dealers in our current system). 


I've never understood this comment as I have seen it before. Isn't the real bitcoin whatever 51% of the network uses? I mean sure there are some people think that BCash is the real bitcoin.
