You don't when you have free power.

In the video we used 14 AntMiner U1 USB Miners and the hashrate is around 22GH/s.
However, you could also use RedFury or Bi-Fury USB Miners which will definitely increase the hash rate to about 40GH/s, free of power.
Also, you could mine Litecoins using DualMiner USB. 
You are free to choose any of your usb miners and let SOLARMINER to power them up with sunlight.

Will you be able to pay back the investments for non-USB miners? I'm sure those who bought slates, boxes are sucking with huge power bills, wondering whether they are actually making money or not?
Remember, power bill is the most money invested when you go mining.

It all depends how you think of bitcoin value, 6 months ago, no one knows bitcoin price can hit $1300, no one knows MtGox goes to insolvency.
But we all know, bitcoin is revolutionary and limited resource

Do you prefer paying a one time fee for solar kit like this or you prefer paying thousand dollars EVERY week for the power bills?

hi Nomnomnomitron, thanks for the precious advice, we are producing an another video right now with the help of a video production company, and your suggestions are definitely helpful.
Regarding the other two questions:
We do accept bitcoins, but you'll have to email us for bitcoin address. We are still looking for a secure online bitcoin payment solution  but until then, all bitcoin payment has to be processed manually by our staff.
The 50W solar panel that come along the package is a foldable design, it's been design for shipping convenience as well as carrying. However, the charge controllers are designed to be compatible with any solar panels that are under 80W and 15~18V range.  50W solar panel is powerful enough for most of the cases, powering devices and charging batteries at the same time, overcome cloudy conditions, most importantly, it's foldable, once folded, it's only about the size of an iPad.

That's right, butterfly, coincraft, hashfast, cointerra and kncminer are all making 28nm ASIC chips. We could expect a bunch of 4+ times faster usb miners in the near future.

If anyone knows any other Bitcoin miners that can be powered over USB 2.0 5V 500mA~750mA, please share it in here.
Here's the SolarMiner USB2 Machine Specs:
Mainboard: Raspberry Pi B with 4GB SD card
USB Ports: 16 USB 2.0 Ports connected to Pi.
Connections: Ethernet socket, in-box WiFi dongle
Batteries: Total of 60,000mAh
Solar Panels: 3 Monocrystalline Solar Panels, 5 Amp each

Some extra information about the machine:
Each battery can last for about 1~2 year.
Batteries are lithium iron phosphate (LFP) ones. In case of no sunlight is available, batteries can last for about 6 hours. 
Solar panels are designed to make sure the charging current is higher than LOAD consumption.  Each solar panel generates 5A (peak), and there are three of those solar panels generating a maximum of 15A.
Solar panels are Monocrystalline ones with efficiency of 17.5%. For those who knows solar panels knows that this is a pretty good conversion rate and the price of those solar panels are not cheap.

Our solar panels are waterproof, but to make the box itself waterproof will increase the cost too much. So...
We have planned to manufacture a shell-cover over the entire box.
