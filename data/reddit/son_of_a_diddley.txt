How can you do that?

Get an RFID chip in him with a bitcoin address, or engrave a qr code into an annodized aluminum dog tag.

An 80w laser cutter.

[This]( may work better and can be done with salt and a 9v battery

If you install wine and winebottler, it's already converted to mac so you can just download it.

Thank you so much! 
I don't want Donald to win, but coins are pretty fun

[It's not a honda]( but the strati seems pretty cool. I definately wouldn't drive it on a public road though

We are *all* Bitcoin on this blessed day!

I know, I'm an idiot. I think I'll take my chances with small amounts of BTC.

Even ours (purchased at 80w, says up to 130w) won't cut metal, not even foil. You can only engrave coated metal, like anodized aluminum, which is what I used.  In the case of anodized aluminum, it turns white where you engrave it. Look into cermark, it's a sort of workaround for steel. It doesn't engrave it- spray the cermark on, and it will actually turn black and bond to the steel in the shape of your picture. Never buy an ebay laser or a glowforge, they are shit from reading about them and looking at the design. Go with full spectrum, epilog, or trotec if you can afford a trotec.

Well, I'm Satoshi Nakamoto, and I find this awesome.

The laser cutter doesn't store the data, it runs off a continuous stream of code from the computer. I'm never going to use this for more than a few bucks. I've actually had bitcoin disappear off of a shitty monsanto promotion flash drive.
