Except, it works because the more others deteriorate, wouldn't that make the value of your more valuable? It in fact does, and having a lambo is actually a fairly decent investment to hold on to, for SOME PEOPLE. Those people being lambo enthusiasts that will only resell the lambo to another lambo enthusiast. That doesn't mean that all of us should go out and buy a vintage, or new, or gently used lambo. If you do not understand the lambo market, we shouldn't be involved in it. Much like how many millionaires will never care about bitcoin. They won't be interested in it or the technology, their investments may be better suited other places.
I believe that is the argument being made.

Is it a set bitcoin amount or is rent based on the USD equivalent?

Bought at 17,4 then like 10hrs later bought again at 16 then was kicking myself a day later because I was then buying a third time at 14,5. Should have just waited the 2 days from the get go.

I still plan on buying in January as well, no matter the  price. Just saying, I would be much happier with buying in lower than higher. I don't regret my 17,4 buy in, but if it was all grabbed at 14k I would have been doing a bit better.
