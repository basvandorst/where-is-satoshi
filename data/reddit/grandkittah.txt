Hmm, I have the 6850 and only get 220 Mhash/s. 
Any idea why the 5850 is dramatically better?

No worries, now you know.

OC the card using the ATI utility. Set your flags -v -w128 -f1 and enjoy 220 Mhash/s.

That's a great explanation, thanks.

I dunno, I would guess your card is using electricity at a rate greater than 80 cents per week can provide. The main downside for me is that when I am mining I cannot game, which is why I bought my graphics card in the first place. 
All else aside, with a 6850, and using a mining pool (I use bitcoin.cz) I mine a little less than 1 BTC per day, call it 20 BTC per month, trading at around 8 USD per BTC you could make up the cost of the card in less than 2 months.
That also means 2 months of electricity, and not really being able to use your graphics card for anything else.
Take that as you will, that was probably more information than you wanted, but hey. Enjoy.

You are ok with making .80 USD per week?

Nope. From your own article:

The bad vibrations are from your use of a url shortener.

Might be malware on the phone?

Interest implies they are using our money, which means BTC is leaving the wallet.

Physics is physics. You need massive amounts of energy to do it, and until cold fusion makes free unlimited energy for everyone, this is not happening.

Look at the numbers on the left, those are the volume numbers.
Check out the chart now: 
Take a look at the volume chart on the bottom, each bar is 1 week over the past 6 months, note the volume of trading. 12 million in currency trades is a lot. IANAE

I only see mobiles having this problem. Have you tried on a computer?
