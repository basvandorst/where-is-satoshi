So you’re saying that they have bought them back. That isn’t the same as a guarantee that they will.

The weird libertarian aspect of bitcoin is something I will never understand.

Tethers are only a liability if they are guaranteeing to buy them back. Is that the case?

No, I meant the response to him by someone who has little to no understanding of either Keynes or Krugman.

Unix didn’t morph into Linux. A lot of people invested in writing an open source implementation and developing it over time. Unix was at least in part replaced by Linux.

Yes, ducks are rapists with corkscrew cocks.

You can think blockchain is cool and interesting without being an autistic shitbag.
Well some of us can anyway.

This is just a silly thing to say, there are plenty of cryptos that have been distributed in decidedly not capitalistic fashions.

There certainly differences of scale but you have all of Western Europe using a mish mash of various universal systems all with varying levels of success that still rate higher than ours.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:41:08
Those are possibilities, certainly. Though they lack the amount of precedent and solid examples that universal health care has.

Someone with a gun can do the same things they always did. You could just as easily be saying “you don’t know the location of my buried treasure! You will never get it”

Take a look at healthcare outcomes, costs, and satisfaction levels between countries and you’ll either be forced to admit that we have a market failure in the U.S, or you will have to resort to dishonest deflections about how spending more for worse outcomes is actually good.
I know you’ll do the latter of course.

Lots of them: 
The most catch-all being overall mortality rates. There is a bunch of information there, but you will find a general trend of the US lagging behind other first world countries in most metrics, winning a few (30 day mortality rate for heart attacks being an important one), and tracking in the middle with a few.
One important metric to observe is wait times, often cited as the primary reason that we just can’t do universal health care. The fact is wait times in the US are far more than than Germany and Netherlands, and Canada isn’t much worse than US.

You’re reading a lot into my statement. I think healthcare should be provided with no cost at the point of service because we can afford to and because it’s demonstrably better (based on comparative outcomes and costs between various national healthcare systems).
And yes low cost is very good. That’s why I favor those systems whose per capita cost is lower.
