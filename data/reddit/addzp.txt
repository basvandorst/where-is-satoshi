To support the bitcoin economy buy and sell goods in bitcoin.  To support the bitcoin network, run a full node client such as bitcoin QT and solo mine or mine on one of the smaller pools to promote the decentralized network.

So something interesting happened to me, I'm making my report from Australia and outside the 45 day buyer protection window.  Both of the people I spoke to refused to reopen my claim after it was already closed stating that it is outside the 45 day window and that BFL are covered by seller protection to which i responded they were not as they are in breach of the TOS by not shipping within 20 days.  
Anyhow after about 30 minutes of back and forth and speaking to a supervisor they would escalate the case to the fraud department instead who would then investigate BFL and contact me by email.
Ill post more details here when/if I ever get them

I'm not sure if there is a group, if there is I'm not part of it nor have I seen mention of it anywhere.  But if you come across it by all means let me know.

Most desktop computers would have a Gfx card of some sort to mine on, it would still use considerable system resources on each of those computers though.  
The network server on the other hand would not usually have a Gfx card in it, so if he is mining on that it would be some sort of cpu miner which would definitely be what is causing the bottleneck that you are experiencing.

Go to blockchain.info and see if anyone else has send bitcoins in/out of the address.  If someone else has put coins in then it isn't unique and it's definitely a scam.  
That is not to say that a unique address means it isn't a scam also :/  Use the ol' "if it seems to good to be true it probably is" logic

Alternatively would it be possible to have the bitcoin mining software loaded on the wifi router, then whenever someone connects they can have access to free wifi but in exchange the system can use a small % of their cpu/gfx hashing capabilities for mining?
