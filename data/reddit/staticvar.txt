Just another reminder btc-e is, as the community states, "btc-e is sketchy as fuck"

rm -Rf ./Bitcoins
Don't make me do it.

It looks like they made a minor update before making their big change.

For those hungry to know  when Mt Gox updates on their front page, we spent this week making a  free text message service that will text you when the Mt Gox front page  updates.

Here's the source code of that screen shot

:-( I'm sorry you think we are sketchy. Why do you think we are not trustworthy? Thank you for any feedback.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:48:42
Thanks for the mention! Jerry's (mine) got removed as well :P

Hehe, only one real way to find out, submit your info for the robot ;).  In all seriousness, we built a backend using Nodejitsu, Cloudant, and Twilio. We load tested it and it we're no where close to even hitting our max.

Here's a pic of that landing page.

Here's the node.js code of how we get through their "cookie authentication". Even anonymous GETS have to do this.  We still have to clear out our private server info from the rest of the code base before posting to Github.

Get a text the next time MtGox updates -&gt; [

Jerry The Robot, the whale watcher ;) That would be awesome.

Your number must have been in our very early database. Thank you for sticking it out. You are in our new database now. We've been dealing with a lot of spam unfortunately.
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:28:12
That would be a weird grave stone. I think it will probably change soon with an update or worst case scenario it disappears for good. Either way, Jerry will let you know.

Mt Gox is currently running a slight white space difference which is the same thing we spotted last night before their update. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:10:18
Mt Gox shows signs of life! They changed their whitespace in their html....
@_date: 2014-03-14 07:34:05
Good job getting it before [Jerry the Robot]( could post ;).  They didn't let us post this link.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:44:02
Thanks man :). It's a fun project for me and my server buddy.
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:23:27
There is a cookie authentication pass that happens when you land on their page. We had to account for that in our monitoring. We're going to release our code soon :-)

To anyone concerned
Mark Karpeles
Representative Director
MtGox Co., Ltd.
Shibuya 2-11-5
Shibuya-ku, Tokyo
ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING AN APPLICATION FOR COMMENCEMENT OF A PROCEDURE OF CIVIL REHABILITATION
MtGox Co., Ltd. made today an application for commencement of a procedure of civil rehabilitation (minji saisei) at the Tokyo District Court. This application was accepted on the same day. Further, MtGox Co., Ltd is under several orders issued by the Court : a preservative order prohibiting it from paying its debts, transferring its assets or establishing security over its assets, an order establishing a comprehensive prohibition of forced attachment of its assets by its creditors and a supervisory order ordering supervision by a supervisory committee. In consequence, MtGox hereby informs you as follows.
We first express our most sincere regrets and apologies for this situation and for causing so much inconvenience to all our users and other interested parties. We will fully respect the above orders and maintain our assets with all the necessary care.
    Financial situation, reasons and timeline leading to this application
        (1) As of now, the liabilities of MtGox Co., Ltd exceed its assets and its financial situation is as follows:
        Total amount of assets	3,841,866,163
        Total amount of current liabilities	6,501,119,371
        (2) The increase of current liabilities may be linked to a loss of bitcoins and customer funds. These are now investigated by an expert and all efforts are made to discover the truth. This application was prompted by the following troubles:
        At the start of February 2014, illegal access through the abuse of a bug in the bitcoin system resulted in an increase in incomplete bitcoin transfer transactions and we discovered that there was a possibility that bitcoins had been illicitly moved through the abuse of this bug.
        As a result of our internal investigation, we found that a large amount of bitcoins had disappeared. Although the complete extent is not yet known, we found that approximately 750,000 bitcoins deposited by users and approximately 100,000 bitcoins belonging to us had disappeared.
        We believe that there is a high probability that these bitcoins were stolen as a result of an abuse of this bug and we have asked an expert to look at the possibility of a criminal complaint and undertake proper procedures.
        On the same day (24th), we found out large discrepancies between the amount of cash held in financial institutions and the amount deposited from our users. The amounts are still under investigation and may vary but they approximate JPY 2.8 billion.
        We are investigating the causes of these problems. Since there are probably a variety of causes including hacking by third parties, we need to investigate a huge amount of transaction reports in order to establish the truth. As of this date, we cannot confirm the exact amount of missing deposit funds and the total amount of bitcoins which disappeared.
        Once we discovered that bitcoins had disappeared and the discrepancies between cash funds and deposit balances, we judged that it would be difficult to continue our activities normally and we therefore closed our site at noon on the 25th (Japan time).
        (3) Regarding the filing of a complaint or damages report, an expert has been mandated and investigations have started. We will make all efforts to ensure that crimes are punished and damages recovered.
        Further we will fully cooperate with inquiries from authorities and investigations related to this matter, in Japan or overseas.
        In order to increase repayments to our creditors, it is necessary to explore the possibility of having MtGox Co., Ltd. continue its business. This is why the civil rehabilitation procedure has been chosen, Rebuilding MtGox Co., Ltd under the supervision of the court in a legally organized procedure while giving proper explanations will not be for the sole benefit of the company but for that of the whole bitcoin community.
        All efforts will now be made to restore the business and recover damages to repay debts to creditors. We hope for the understanding and cooperation of all.
