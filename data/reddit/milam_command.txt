Great interview, which does a good job of highlighting the positive aspects of Charlie Shrem. FYI, they don't touch on his current legal situation until very briefly in the last two minutes.

"[D]id you say it’s the love of money that’s the root of all evil? To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men." [Money Speech](

Prediction. He will "come out" as Satoshi in the near future. It's looking like it'd be safe for him to do so. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:55:40
Clever theory. That would explain a lot. 
There's a fractal quality to the whole bitcoin phenomenon--its creation, technical nature, real-world implications. The closer you examine any part of it, the more complex and interesting it becomes. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:26:46


Exactly. This is a fascinating interview and Gilder is brilliantly insightful on most of what he writes/ talks about. 
The logical implication of _DannyBrewster's POV is that we should only listen to and learn from clones of ourselves. This is a recipe for ignorance. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 23:15:12
I've read all his books; not just Wikipedia. 
He's a wonderful author; not a wacko. He's a libertarian and a social conservative. Microcosm and Telecosm are beautiful testaments to the power of technology and entrepreneurs who create it. His article "Life After Television" is prescient. 
(I didn't care much for his Men and Marriage, his celebration of the beta provider role for men.)
He's getting old now, but I expect that he'll "get" bitcoin. I'm looking forward to his book with interest.
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:09:22
Yes. Very odd. And one more good reason to believe that Szabo is, in fact, Satoshi.
He was a college professor and I'm sure did all kinds of college professor things in public. And there's not ONE picture of him--from a conference, a student gathering, a faculty guide or get-together--put online and labeled as him by someone?
A man smart enough to invent bitcoin is smart enough to know that, if/ when bitcoin takes over the financial system, he’ll become one of the most famous, sought-after people in the world. 
And, one hopes, smart enough to engineer his own safety and anonymity.

Great presentation, explaining the relationship between "human rights" and personal and property rights--and how all can be safeguarded by using bitcoin protocol.  A good primer on the basics of property rights, echoing the property rights ideas of John Locke and Murray Rothbard.﻿

You're getting downvoted, but there's a grain of truth here. When you first see/hear Jeffrey Tucker, the second thing you notice is his brilliance. The first thing you notice is his, shall we say, "flamboyance." 
He's a great guy, a great advocate for cryptocurrency and freedom, but I wish he'd just come right out and address this. Either, "I'm gay. So what?" or "I understand that I'm 'flamboyant,' but seriously I'm not gay. This is just the way I am."

The [shows]( with Jeffrey Tucker and Glenn Beck (and the young lady and young man) were fantastic publicity. 
I like Glenn Beck. Yeah that's right. I said it. 
Most Redditors think that he's the antichrist because, I don't know, he's bombastic right-leaning(?) 
But he is open minded in a good way--open to discussing and learning on-air about new, weird ideas like the singularity and bitcoin. 
Kudos to everyone involved in this Beck thing.

Your scenario is entirely possible. 
Most bitcoin users accept possible “boom and bust” trajectories. Bitcoin also may end, not with a bang, but with a whimper--a slow, sad, gradual decline into irrelevance  where the world just says, “Meh; not interested any more.”

As mentioned in [this previous reddit post]( Szabo seems to be doing everything right to maintain his anonymity. 
Not sure how this can last, though, if a reporter with more brain cells than Leah McGrath Goodman starts working to track him down.
