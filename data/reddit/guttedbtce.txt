I just need to say this,somewhere to someone,but I hope that btc-e comes back and allows us to retrieve our coins,I have just over 2 btc on the exchange,I had already lost 7 btc,that I had mined,to the mt.gox hack,so this news about btc-e and Alexander is kind of bittersweet.I know about not leaving coins in others hands,they were not sitting,I was trying to trade into more coin,I started with .8 btc that I had converted from ltc I had mined as well and slowly worked my way up,I am not an aggressive trader I try and take "sure bets" rather than risky trades.
I am absolutely gutted right now,I have this pit in my stomach that has been there all day and I have this anxious feeling I just can not shake,I feel like I could just break down and cry,I literally have tears in my eyes as I type this,my gf knows about what happened and she knows I'm upset,but I really don't want her to know just how much I am shook.i don't know what else to say this is a hard fucking pill to swallow.

Thanks guys/gals,I didn't mean to come off so dramatic,it really wasn't my intention at all,I was nearly in tears,yes but i think mainly because I love btc so much and i cant believe this shit happened again and taht I got caught in it again.2 btc is not the end of the world,not by a long shot,but I put my time and effort into building those 2 btc through mining ltc and then trading up,I think that's why it stings so much,that and the fact I had plans of building enough btc to put a down payment on a house as well as keeping some to hold.
I love btc,I have been involved one way or another since around 2010,I had even given away a little over 10 btc beofe the mt.gox stuff happened.this shit in no way will kill me or break me,I know that there are people who are out huge amounts of btc and I feel for them much more than I feel bad for myself.
