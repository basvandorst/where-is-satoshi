But do we know of any movements that are coming from that wallet lately?
@_date: 2019-03-21 15:28:04
What is your perspective on this?
I mean, based on the previous trends in the graphs, they do this multiple times. Does this mean anything at all?
Or is it all speculators making a quick buck?

Doesn't sound like your analysis is based on facts. Bitcoin's future will be adaptability, future easy access liquidity, and cross chain use throughout the current corporate systems like, Facebook, Whatsapp, Xrp, etc...
@_date: 2019-03-18 12:12:07
There is no mention of price anywhere.
@_date: 2019-03-21 15:47:23
Well, it looks like its a repeating pattern.
Secondly, it seems to steadily hold at 3955, though I am uncertain of that. Usually it follows with another dump, like a tsunami. 
But the last time it followed by another bull run.

I don't know about a loss, I'm already almost got my whole investment back. I don't plan on investing more, so its another 200 dollars extra in my bank. But we will see what happens.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:31:54

@_date: 2019-06-26 15:07:17

@_date: 2019-06-26 17:58:49
Word, you have convinced me
@_date: 2019-06-13 01:22:13
Damn, I am sure. I mean, for me it was 330 USD I was willing to lose. 
If the website lasts for at least 6 Mo I can certainly make 200usd per month without futher investment.
The company is only 3mo old and is registered with the Australian securities commission under a trading platform as well...
Anything suspicious besides that?

By the looks of it, it looks like you found it on the deep web!
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:42:34
I know that... But what would happen if they announced it?
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:45:53
You don't think it would even make a dent on the price?
How arrogant of you.
