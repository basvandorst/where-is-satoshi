BTC Aside for the moment, can you buy insurance for digital items on a HDD?

How does that work exactly? Why would I get shadows banned?

I just hope it's going to them and not just a clever redditor  with Photoshop.

How do I get a seat at the cool kids table?

Don't gamble it.  Pass it on to the next redditor who makes you laugh, or gives you a useful tip.

You need to factor in the increase in value of Bitcoin over time though.

This is getting rather exciting to watch and I don't even have a whole Bitcoin. I have spoken to a few random people that have made some significant amounts of money so far and I think its great that some every day people are now being given opportunities that even 6 months ago would have still only been a dream.

Some peoples generosity astounds me.  Makes me feel just a little bit better about the future of Bitcoin, and people for that matter.

Wow, Thank You.  I actually was asking how do I set it up so I have the ability to give and receive tips but I now see the link the bot gives.  I think this is the beginning of a great idea, especially in subreddits where professionals or just anyone heavily versed in a subject are freely giving advice and tips,  Now we have a way to give back and also promote BTC as a whole.

The best thing anyone can do for bitcoin is to give them away to as many people as possible.  The more people who have them and want to spend them, the more business will begin accepting them, which will then increase the value of the bitcoins you have.

We need to get the coins into the hands of more "common everyday people".  The more people who have the coins to spend, the more likely a large company is going to notice and begin adopting ways for customers to spend the coins at their stores.

I'm so happy Whose line is returning, but sad Drew is not part of it.
