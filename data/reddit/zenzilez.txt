They will lose so much faith in the community if they try to resume as if nothing happened and do not reimburse.  The only reasonable thing to do is to spread out losses.  Plus being mugged on a train is a stupid analogy.  This was a $80m heist.  Not repaying btc holders will cause a serious userbase divide and there will also be no btc in the exchange or purpose for anyone to put btc back on the exchange if the funds are so insecure.  If they repay, then great, but its a lot to repay.  I'm pretty sure there is more usd than btc on the exchange, so a haircut + payment over time to balance things out, or even a partial reimbursement from a haircut wouldnt impact the usd holders significantly.

I can tell there is a clear bias here.  What if some users lose a massive investment or their life savings because of a security issue then everyone will stick with bitfinex?  Open your eyes.
I held both btc and usd, I will be impacted either way but for the sake of the company I hope to see some reimbursement.  It will restore faith and will be the only way to really continue and not lose a userbase.  Likewise, the site cant run without any btc.

I dont think you have any understanding of their lrgal boundaries or terms of service.  Extreme selfishness detected.  No worries, if they dont hajrcut and reimburse then the business will fail and your money will be lost anyway.

Found the issue.  It's fine, just not showing on the web browser, user it on mycellium and you will be able to see it all!
