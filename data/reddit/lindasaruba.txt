Great to hear that you enjoyed everything. We use the bitpay app and it works very well! Hope to see you back in Aruba soon.

We are right off the coast of Venezuela, lots of tourists, mostly American. Lots of direct flights from NY, Boston, Philly, Atlanta, Miami, Orlando. Any time is good to visit. Always have nice weather.
@_date: 2016-04-18 12:11:45
I think I might print something. It does take a lot of time to explain it to people who do not know what it is. But we will never stop accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-18 12:14:25
It is picking up a little bit. We have some locals paying in bitcoin as well now, and we will be having our first bitcoin meetup soon. A tiny community is starting to form. Most of the bitcoin payments are still American tourists though. Thanks for visiting us!

Thank you!

We are in Palm Beach. Check out the map on

Hey Acejam. We are not the only one anymore. You can find a list of bitcoin accepting businesses in Aruba on the directory on our other website.
Our restaurant is the first one on the list (Linda's), the others are not really touristy things, except maybe the Tennis School if you want to get some lessons.
We are working on setting up more merchants with bitcoin, so hopefully we will have more soon. Slowly but surely.
Greetings from Aruba.
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:19:55
That's what we want to achieve eventually. I have been doing my best to explain bitcoin to them, setting up wallets and stuff.

@_date: 2014-12-27 03:04:18
Awesome. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-28 04:16:58
See you next year.
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:28:19
I will have to check what the law says. I wouldn't mind selling at the register.
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:04:59
Yes! We added our business to coinmap. Any others that we can add our restaurant to?
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:15:49
We krijgen naast Amerikaanse toeristen ook wel lokale gasten, waarvan een gedeelte Nederlands is. Ook af en toe Nederlandse toeristen.

In Nederland geboren. 15 jaar geleden naar Aruba gegaan.
@_date: 2014-12-27 04:14:11
That would have been nice. I hope you visit our island again soon!

My brother and I own a Dutch pancake house in Aruba. We have been interested in bitcoin (and lurking on r/bitcoin) for a while now, and decided to start accepting it at our restaurant.
Since the servers already use an iPod touch to take orders, we just switch from the regular POS app to the Coinbox POS app, enter the amount and let the guest scan the QR code. I just put up this sign yesterday and have already had two people ask me what bitcoin is, but no payments yet. I don't know when/if it will catch on in Aruba, but about 80% of our business is from U.S. tourists, especially the North Eastern U.S., so we will see what happens.
I also thought it would be a good idea to make a separate sign on the window or on each table with a QR code to tip your server. Any other ideas are welcome!
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:29:39
I had not heard about that yet. I will look into that Bitcoin Drop.
Remittances are also a very big thing here. Lots of workers from Venezuela, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Philippines, and a lot of people who send money to Europe and the U.S. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 04:16:43
The diving here is very good. Lots of reef and many great wrecks.
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:16:49
I lived in Curacao for three months, I have to respectfully disagree :P
@_date: 2014-12-27 03:06:51
We installed WiFi about a year ago when we started using the iPods to take orders. Almost everybody brings their phone along to the restaurant and hooks up to the internet.
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:18:35
Thanks for the tip! I am also from Rotterdam. Moved out here 15 years ago.
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:22:02
Nos tei! haha danki. Curacao ta dushi tambe, bon snorkeling banda di e tugboat ey.
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:15:59
Thank you. Hope you had a nice time!
@_date: 2014-12-27 03:04:51
I hope you end up finding a place. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:43:07
Thanks for the tip!
I will keep everybody updated. It is kind of a no brainer for us. We are sick of merchant fees, and the banks here are no good because of a lack of competition (there are only 4 banks). We just install the free app and accept it. We are holding for now, untill we can find a supplier that will take it, or an employee that wants to be paid in it.
We have been thinking about buying a Bitcoin ATM as well, but I don't know if there is enough demand yet, and I don't know if I can get support in Aruba if something goes wrong, especially on the hardware side. Shipping is a pain in the ass and very expensive from Aruba.
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:33:01
That Bitcoin drop in Dominica looks pretty awesome. Would be a great thing to do in Aruba. Small population as well, about 100,000 people.
@_date: 2014-12-27 01:36:19
Please do!
Edit: Aruba. is. awesome!
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:27:35
Thanks for the tip. This is just poorly printed on normal printer paper. I might have to get some nice looking decals.
@_date: 2016-11-07 19:20:22
Make it rain!
@_date: 2016-11-12 12:58:38
It was great to be there on stage with you!
@_date: 2019-02-27 16:33:57
We will see you this summer! Thanks for the kind words. Great to hear that you like our restaurant. We are still accepting bitcoin and offer a 10% discount if you pay with it, so remember to bring your wallet.  
@_date: 2015-07-28 12:18:07
I am not sure. You can try to contact them at the TEDxAruba website. I have no idea of they already have all of the speakers lined up or if they are still looking for people. You can also contact TED and see if you can organize TEDx event on your island. The TEDx events are independent events, I think that you just pay a fee to TED.
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:25:07
I couldn't change the amount of tickets, so I went through the whole process twice and bought 1 ticket each time. When you select the "bitcoin" payment option it just shows you the bitcoin address that's there, it is always the same address, you can check it out yourself if you are interested. Just scroll down to payment method and choose bitcoin.
I am not sure how they are linking specific bitcoin payments to specific tickets/people if they are re-using the same address over and over. This could have been done a lot better, but again, I am just glad it was available. I think this is the first TEDx ever that accepts bitcoin for ticket.
I will let you know if I have any updates on this.
@_date: 2015-07-28 03:26:21
I think it is just TEDxAruba. Hope to see the rest follow.
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:01:43
Yeah, those are the two tickets that I bought. I do predict very low bitcoin participation for this, since there are almost no people using bitcoin in Aruba. There was one small presentation about bitcoin in the run-up to TEDxAruba, so I guess they are showing how it can be used for online payments.
I also think the implementation could be better, maybe with bitpay or mycelium gear or something, without the need to reuse the addresses. I was just happy it was possible at all.
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:50:35
The implementation could have been better, but I am very happy that it was possible. In one of the events leading up to TEDxAruba there was a 15 minute presentation about bitcoin that was very informative and got a lot of people interested.
@_date: 2016-09-16 15:23:16
Thanks for the tip! Will take a look at it.
@_date: 2015-09-30 22:20:54
I will try to get them to install wifi on the sailboat, which can also be good for some social media marketing, and having people share some pictures online. It might not be worth it to pay a monthly fee to set up wifi for a small number of transactions. Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2015-09-01 17:37:05
Still this problem for me, even though I can use bitcoin (and coinbase) without any problems. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 22:19:27
Yes, it might be a challenge to get good and stable wifi set up on a sailboat out on the water, but I guess it's the only option. I will check it out. Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2015-11-08 18:24:31
From the home page you go to "tools", and then you can see the link to the wallet generator at the top of the page.
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:06:14
This one was generated on bitcoin.com. They use the bitaddress software on their site and added the "bank friendly" option as a joke. It is indeed just a regulat bitcoin key and address.
@_date: 2015-11-09 04:09:01
Thank you. I just found it on bitcoin.com though, didn't make it.
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:44:34
You are welcome! I hope you get to visit Aruba sometime.
@_date: 2015-10-20 12:09:58
The simplest way would be to sign up with bitpay and get their app on a phone/tablet/ ipod touch in the restaurant. You can only accept bitcoin with this, so the employees can't touch any bitcoin. It gets sent to your friend's bitcoin address the next day.
There are also apps such as Coinbox: bitcoin point of sale (android), where you do not need an account. It just allows you to accept bitcoin, and you can program a certain bitcoin address in the app that you friend controls. We have used both of these at our restaurant, and they work well.
Both of these apps are only for receiving bitcoin, so there is no need to worry about employees getting their hands on his bitcoin. In both cases, you can program a bitcoin address that the coins will end up on, so you can have it end up on his phone wallet, or his multi sig wallet for example. Choice is his, I would recommend a hardware wallet, or multi sig wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-24 12:52:31
I just received your email. Thanks. I will look into updating the listing when I have time.
@_date: 2015-10-01 22:02:50
The merchant in this case just has a cell phone with a 4G plan. Now that I think of it, the easiest way is probably to use that phone as a wifi hotspot for a little bit to do the transaction
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:33:24
El Gaucho is great! Awesome steaks.
I don't know anybody at El Gaucho, but I have been spreading the word about bitcoin to a few other restaurant owners/managers that I know. Who knows, the may follow our lead!
