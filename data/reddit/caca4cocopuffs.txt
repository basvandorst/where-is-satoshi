Amen to that. Verge is a prime example...

Yes, I have seen the profit. I know it will take quite a few months, even without the cost of electricity. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 00:42:35
Chances of getting fired are basically zero. What I fear more is having trouble with the mining equipment, or just basically going through the trouble associated with buying and maintaining everything.
@_date: 2015-12-06 00:59:43
Yes, it would take at least 18 months or so.
@_date: 2015-12-06 05:23:30
Never knew about cloud mining. Will look into it. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:38:32
At this point my employer is activeley looking at bitcoin as a potential revenue stream and as a potential payment system. I wasn't entireley clear on the situation. Sorry about some of the misscommunication.

Eugene Kaspersky has already mentioned about the need for some sort of ID cards that link people to the internet directly. There is a story on CBS 60 minutes about him and his visions for the future if I remember correctly. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:16:07
Nice of you accusing me of being a thief when I have't done anything. You have no idea how I make my living and what sort of arrangement I have with my employer.
@_date: 2014-01-28 02:59:06
I think you guys are all missing the point ? How would you make something like BTC illegal if you wanted to ? You simply tie it to drugs and illegal activity, even if it's to the nth degree. Think of bitcoin as a secret compartment in a car. That compartment can be used to hide anything including drugs. 
In [this]( case the person responsible for making the compartments received more jail time than the drug traffickers themselves.

Of course true believers are unfazed, the bitcoin protocol provides a level of trust that even cash cannot provide. U.S. dollars, euros, British pounds are counter fit on a daily basis, but not bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-19 02:45:35
So wait, how does paypal make $$ if it will accept currencies such as btc? Will they add a special tax? Who will do business with them? The only way forward for them is to eventually act as an exchange, but that is not likely.
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:30:04
Ok, i see what you mean. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-01 18:50:32
That's what I was thinking. As long as the big players don't get too big, hash rates, difficulties only follow the upwards trend. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:26:21
Would you please elaborate on that? A photo of myself or what exactly? I have an iPhone, but haven't used the blockchain app in a good while.
@_date: 2014-04-02 02:33:05
OFC they will try to get at him by any means necessary, but just for a few minutes, let's suppose the price of bitcoin dropped to 1 US cent. What then ? 
@_date: 2014-12-23 00:06:15
Actually the do have plenty of expenses, and a lot of money is used for art grants.
@_date: 2016-02-23 03:10:31
Wait, isn't a lot of the mining done in china due to the cheap cost of electricity and hardware ?
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:24:43
Not so fast there mister. I believe they are trying to reinvent themselves or something. This fucking zombie will not die.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:22:13
Honestly, while some people here are very optimistic about GS entering this market to make more money, remember, these guys are notorious for shorting various assets. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 21:29:57
These days, it seems operating a torrent site such as kickass, is almost as bad as operating a darknet drug site. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 18:30:35
DPU ? I don't think so. Sounds a bit like porn if you ask me.
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:21:43
They will crash and burn. The week long delay does not help. I deleted my account with them yesterday and I'm looking for another way to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-08-17 16:35:51
The price point seems good. I just can't wait to see one in New York City.
@_date: 2013-10-08 00:23:36
So wait, how do you explain all these Wall street assholes walking around free ? Except for Bernie Madoff ofc.
@_date: 2013-07-18 18:56:42
Well you got me there. (LoL) I'm sure there must be another solution.
@_date: 2013-04-28 18:54:19
Why do I have the feeling Silk Road does a better job holding BTC. (aside from the recent ddos fiasco)
@_date: 2013-09-21 23:38:19
They can fight back but they cannot outlaw bitcoin. It boils down to bitcoin being malicious software. It simply isn't. At some point Chuck Schumer thumped his chest on how he's going to shut down Silk Road. This was two years ago and nothing has been done.
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:10:49
Well I do have free electricity (at work). I can plug anything into any outlet without a cause for concern. But I don't have any mining hardware :(
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:43:50
Yes, and by 2019 I will become a hipster of bitcoin and brag to everyone that i've been using it for 8 years, before it became too mainstream.
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:49:07
Yes, multiple copies of the (encrypted) wallet can exist. If someone else has a copy and the key to the wallet they can spend as they please, rendering the FBI's copy useless.
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:28:08
I'm totally surprised it took them this long to figure out his real identity given all these facts. I mean if the dude went by the book it would have taken them forever ...
@_date: 2013-10-25 15:50:03
The palm scan is a total deal breaker. We use bitcoins for the same reasons we use cash: convenience, ease, anonymity etc. only a matter of time before someone comes up with a decent design involving a raspberry pi and puts an illegal machine in the back of the kwick-e-mart.
@_date: 2013-04-28 19:00:16
In that case all the bank deregulation laws passed in the past 20 years or so should technically work in our favor, right ?
@_date: 2013-07-21 16:02:32
The idea is really cool. Unfortunatley my crApple iPhone does not have NFC technology.
@_date: 2013-10-08 00:29:00
Not a private island but Brazil sure sounds like a nice place to live, especially with 80 mil to spend.
@_date: 2013-07-18 13:37:24
How bout you pin a qr code with a little btc logo on the bottom and you dont say anything. Most bitcoin users know what thats all about.
@_date: 2013-06-10 15:03:15


I wonder now if he took that laptop to work. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 02:08:28
Not only that but so far attacks on the TOR network have been unsuccessful. Unless you use the same username out in the open AND darknet you won't be caught. That's why Edward Snowden has a TOR sticker on his laptop. 
If 3 years from now, when the internet will be even less free, a headline will read "Thousands of people arrested in darknet sting" or something to that degree; will discourage people from even trying TOR. 
@_date: 2013-08-17 23:55:07
So according to their fucked up logic, to enforce these laws, mining software/hardware would be illegal? Or at least you have to register yourself with the feds so they can take their cut ?
@_date: 2013-07-26 02:12:34
You have to remember, he is trying to ease people into the idea of what bitcoin is. It's very hard to explain bitcoin to people that barely started to use plastic to pay for things just a few years ago. What I mean is, a good friend of mine lives in a small town in the middle of nowhere. Only cash was accepted at the local store, until last year.
@_date: 2013-07-21 21:02:19
This must be a hardware upgrade, not software. My guess is that Apple will jump on the bandwagon with the new iPhone 5S or 6. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:57:25
While I totally agree with you, won't this cause a "schism" in the exchanges ? What i mean is, will there be two exchange rates? I can go to mt.gox or coinbase or whatever an buy clean or legit coins for one price. The alternative is to go to localbitcoins or otc and buy the anonymous coins at a higher price.
@_date: 2013-06-23 19:30:53
But because everyone involved with bitcoins is transmitting "money", shouldn't we all fall in the same category of money transmitters under this flawed logic?
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:52:22
The idea is great but not too practical. What I mean is, if these things really take off, would be robbers will target people wearing these devices and use them to steal whatever. The technology has to be able to be embedded into any existing piece of jewelery. Yes, even a prince Albert piercing :-P
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:26:03
Very true. I have yet to see software that is illegal to have on your computer (besides malware and viruses). But the exchanges are the weak point. Look at what wikileaks and you can see how they struggled when pay pal, and the major credit cards stopped doing business with them. There has to be another way to exchange bitcoins for currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:22:29
IMHO, half or close to half of the bitcoins traded on the internet might be due to silk road and gambling sites. I might be wrong tho.
@_date: 2013-08-13 03:44:05
Fun fact: wife will fly from New York to Dusseldorf Germany. Price of plane ticket was $278. Airport taxes : $682.
Ridiculous is not even a word to describe the situation.

Oh why thank you! It does look promising.
@_date: 2013-03-19 23:04:34
Blaaaaahh...never worry, the only trick here is to get big enough to become immune from the law. Look at HSBC. ^_^

So if you were in DPR's shoes, would you go to trial or take the deal ?

The only problem with African nations is that their internet infrastructure is poor at best. Slowly but surely they are getting there, but the vast majority do no have internet access. Heck, they don't even have access to clean water and power 24 hours a day. Hopefully the more developed countries like South Africa will lead the way.
