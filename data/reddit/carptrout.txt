Bitcoin has already been defined by the US Government as a commodity similar to stocks and is taxed as such.  
I took a look at ZDNet just now and it's about what I expected.  A dated irrelevant magazine that is struggling to survive.  Stirring up controversy will only prolong their slow agonizing death.
ZDNet is big on reporting and promoting technologies such as M2M and the IoT which are the very definition of anti-privacy and as such are lovers of the data/litigation explosion that will soon follow.  
So, I take ZDNet for what they are truly worth in my life, which is absolutely nothing anyway.

Yeah right, If you buy a machine and get it delivered on time, that's a joke and it's probably been mined to death before you ever see it and IF you ever see it!  Hardware scams abound, see BFL for reference.  You've proved nothing.  BTC Hardware mining pools are also scammer sink holes you jerk.  There's too many of those to even count .  It's all too well known about hardware mining pool operators pulling up stakes and disappearing in the dark of night with dishonest profits.  Don't punk ass lie. Gavin didn't call them out because he can't afford to to call them out as they pay his rent, that is all.

You sir are obviously not a miner and speaking way over your head here.  It's everything like a Ponzi scheme, that's why you get constant warnings about bitcoin being a high risk investment.  Miners keep pouring in because there's no other place to find work in the world for 50 somethings with Tech experience.  That is a perfect setup for a Ponzi, no matter what logic that you can dig up to suggest otherwise.  You won't see any miners dropping off the map in the near future, people are starving.  You would be amazed what they will do for a regular meal.  Welcome to Obama's America if you voted for him, because you got what you had coming.

Meh, around $40 is the common going price for resale 'prime' shares in GAW's own very public marketplace, nothing to hide here.  I'm sure if someone wants to ever file a lawsuit, they can obtain sufficient records from GAW, regardless of what I do or do not choose to disclose.  If anyone wants to sue me for $72 profit that I made, then I say to them - "good luck with chasing after fractions of pennies" or worse.  GAW claims 60,000 cloud miners, so 72/60,000 means each potential claimant nets $0.0012 from me - completely laughable and suggesting otherwise is what is in reality - idiotic.  Don't spend your 1000th of a cent all in one place.  I never made a significant investment with GAW's cloud, they would have had to earn that trust over time first.  I don't believe GAW is a Ponzi, I just didn't like the way they ran the business after they quit being a hardware retailer and kept tinkering with their new buggy cloud mining operation, so I reinvested where I was more comfortable.  If you want to call that a crime, I don't know what to tell you.
I also lost money on other types of GAW cloud mining shares, so I could join that lawsuit and sue myself and get some more of my money back that way ;).  So sue me ( I double-dog dare you) and just because you *might* successfully sue me, there is no guarantee that you will ever collect, as the courts don't provide for that.  Take me for instance, who lives on the fringes of Society these days, you don't stand a snowballs' chance in Climate Change Theory of collecting anything.  It could get nasty for the 'lawsuit happy' fool indeed.  But we're not done yet, oh No!  You can also count on the fact that I'll counter-sue you for much more as you would have attacked my character and good standing in the Bitcoin community.  But why stop here, there, or anywhere...?
If you insist on viewing cloud mining through a Ponzi lens, then the whole way that the blockchain is designed and works could be viewed as an elaborate Ponzi scheme as most miners via any method of mining will never ROI.   hmmm... It's funny how Gavin neglected to mention that when he was busy issuing warnings about how many of the 'Cloud' mining operations could possibly turn out to be a scam.  The basic fact is that the original intent of mining was never for mining to be massively profitable, but rather mining is at it's core meant to secure the blockchain.  I never expect to ROI completely as a miner and any other miner who who believes they will get into this business today and ROI, much less make a massive profit is delusional to begin with.  Investing in mining for profit is simply a high risk investment from a financial standpoint, not unlike the rest of Bitcoin.  Some will win, some will lose, and only time will tell.  There's plenty of warnings out, like this one... Don't risk what your not willing to lose when investing in Bitcoin.

The problem is that PGP IS a pain in the butt and the email is largely insignificant.  TFA is the only way to go. I've never lost a single BTC because of my email or really any other reason.

No, Bitcoin has been far too helpful for me personally.  I can't help but think of some of the intangables that I am grateful for such as a vast amount of education, experience, and consiquently a much improved awareness and  understanding of currencies, fiat, and investing.
I also try to keep things in perspective such that while it's been a rough year for me as a Bitcoin miner, it's also been equally rough for me financially outside of Bitcoin also.  That's on me though, I take responsibility for that.

I want to see growth in the industry, yes, but this is NOT healthy competition as you state.  LTC at $1.30 being to BTC at $220 is not healthy.  That's the best is ever been and it's been that way since the beginning.  If you thing a buck and change is competition to $200, then you are sadly mistaken.  No Alt has even come close to doing better then that, and I will state that none will.  Not in the form that we have Crypto today in general.

I know fully what the intent of Bitcoin was, but it's proven to be a problem, to the tune that people have lost fortunes and the media has picked it apart while focusing on the scams.  Bitcoin cannot get traction while these things continue to happen over and over again.  Why can't Bitcoiners show their face, prove they are honest or a thief?  I submit that we put a name and a face to a transaction and then things will move forward.  I don't like it, I wish it was different.  However, you cannot trust anonymous people evidently, which was a 'duh'.  Satoshi got that part completely wrong.

Alts haven't done anything, but show greed.  What is a canard anyway?  A fancy word for fools to try and tell the common folk that they are fools?  Bitcoin is not defined by complacency, venture capital, or you and I.  Sidechains, Forks, you are going to have to buy people to manage that, and that is anti-bitcoin by it's very nature. So Bitcoin eats the Alts, we agree, but I don't think we see it the same way, I wouldn't throw out your SHA miners yet.

Bitcoin follows the same path that all digital assets have since Simlife.  Mine or Bot it and sell it to someone who needs digital cash or a valuable rare asset, as in the case of Simlife.  The beauty of Bitcoin is that it's easier to bank because of companies like Coinbase so you don't have to list it on Ebay.  That's all that has really changed since 1992.  I will state that I love Bitcoin, but it has no legs, only a lot of wasted VC at this point.  I've yet to walk into a single establishment in my small progressive town in the forward state of Oregon where the owners have even likely heard of Bitcoin, much less accept it as payment for goods or services.  It's a pre-beta experiment to solve the double spend problem which was never much of an issue to begin with, since nobody double sold Simlife assets anyway, and lived in the business to make another transaction.  If they double spent, OK - but it meant they were done forever in the community.  So they didn't do it, it was not worth it.  The weak anonymity aspect of Bitcoin has proven to only make things worse, not better as scammers are drawn to that idea like flies to crap.  As an experiment, I wore one of those popular Josh Wise Dogecar Tees to several establishments in my town and asked the owner what they thought the shirt represented and guess what the vendor said every single time?  NASCAR and/or a cute puppy, not digital currency.
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:23:54

I would argue that trust and reputation are worth more in a transaction then a sudo anonymous  decentralized ledger.  Double spending is an issue, just not as big as has been promoted.  If you take away the anonymity,and replace it with trust and reputation, then the problem largely goes away.  The blockchain is interesting, but it's not enough to secure a transaction as has been proven.  It's an interesting technology to be sure, but nobody has really found the best and most proper use for it yet.  So let's have the blockchain for the sake of avoiding the double spend, but make it anonymous?  Make it accountable, show your stuff.  Earn a reputation as being reliable and you don't have to hide.

This concept is so big, I threw everything else I complained about away.
 The network is going to have start capping large mining pools, if we want mining to remain truly decentralized.  I'd cap anyone over 1 THS with a major speeding penalty.  That will get things back in alignment real fast.
Fines collected for going over the speed limit would result in fees being paid back to miners who abide by the rules.
Faster newer ASIC's don't really benefit very many people at this point, and there's nothing positive to be gained by continuing their development.
While this concept changes Bitcoin in a major way, remember it is an experiment.  There's an obvious fail in that large pools have developed and that does need fixing.

True, we can only do our best in regards to security for sure and there are definitely no guarantees.  If I received an unexpected email from Coinbase.com that wanted a 'click-through' response, I'd login to my account via bookmark or call them on the phone, but I still wouldn't click through.

There is no Crypto 2.0.  The rumors of Crypto 1.0's death have been greatly exaggerated.  Bitcoin and Litecoin are your best options and have been since the beginning.

That would be great, thanks!  When I think about it, it's interesting that both the scam and the legit email showed up at about the same time, coincidence perhaps.  It may also be that the scammer played on the knowledge of the outside mailing domain usage business practice.  If Coinbase came out and advertised "You will never get an email from us that is not from Coinbase.com".  Things would get cleared up real fast.  
And yes, survey's can be pulled in house fairly easily, there's software available for managing the push, lists, content, etc.  The process of analyzing  of the data may need to be outsourced, but generally not.   In a long IT career, I just happened to work on such a project once, that is coincidence. :)

But don't reason it away, because it's how progress works.  Those who take the risks also get the rewards.

You are running down a rabbit hole here and not sticking to the main path (and by the way, how could you possibly claim that third party surveys are given no more then once a year when you haven't even been a company for enough years to give that statement credible statistical viability).  I'm sure Delighted is a great company, however it doesn't prevent the possibility that an inside rouge might be able to operate from within Delighted and you couldn't control that.  It happens all the time.  I have nothing against Delighted, only a security concern in Coinbase providing customers' email addresses to third party businesses for any purpose.  
Besides, if you are providing email addresses to Delighted, what other businesses are you providing them to?  This is just a now known example of where you did give email addresses out.  If that were multiplied, the odds only get even greater that this type of information about your customers will eventually leak out.
I feel like I'm having to teach you basic security concepts here and that's downright scary considering that your Coinbase 3l33t and I'm unemployed.  I love Coinbase as a company, you do great things for me, but you worry me regarding some of your business practices.  Don't shoot yourself in the foot while trying to do good.  Good security practices will get you more business in this arena then a one question customer satisfaction survey that  a 5 year old could analyze.

Thanks for the well thought out explanation.  Yup, I agree with you.  What's Hearn got that's so attractive then?  Why even bring it up? A bad job offer is just that.

I made some money at it for a short while, sold out when it got crazy.  I hear noises about a comeback (cloud mining 2.0 perhaps), but little action - so it makes me wonder.  I'd definitely read those legal disclaimers through and pass on any company that has it in the fine print to shut down for any reason and claim that it's legitimate.  When you mine, you mine, good or bad.  You don't stop.  It's that way with my home miners and it's the standard by which I would judge any cloud operation from this point forward.  They are in it to win it, or they don't live here.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:54:31
I didn't lose, I bailed when the focus shifted from mining Bitcoin and did very well.  You have to be quicker then that.  If someone wants to buy into Homero Coin, that is up to them, but when I got into mining, I set my focus on Bitcoin and Litecoin and nothing else because those two coins are the benchmark standards.  All cloud mining now has a bad name anyway, I don't care what anyone says or what company jumps into the game.  It's a done deal.  I mine with my own hardware.  Why pay somebody else to do what you can do for yourself?  OK, so right now the cost of electricity is higher then the profits.  Well,,,, Hodl.  I could absorb the losses in operating expenses that I have for many YEARS to come.  They can't win that battle.  It's a fairly reasonable bet that the price will go up again, provided that you can absorb a few short term losses.  Then when the price does go up, your balance sheet will also shift up and absorb those losses very quickly.  That's what nobody talks about and that's what you heard about here first.
This is the exact reason why the hobby miner that all the experts fret about so much don't go away when the difficulty rises and the price drops.  We know what is going on and are not fooled by it.  It's really kind of funny as you can see difficulty/price manipulation all over the markets to try and drive home miners out, yet the hobby miners keep mining and it's the quick buck companies that actually disappear.

Many probably do, I've sold more then a few that way.  But, I suspect that as myself, that many are also more diverse in their thinking.  It's about survival too.  You have to be quick and smart or you won't last long for sure.  Look at the hash rates for evidence of what I say, they haven't dropped nearly as much as the price of coins.  It's not short term gainers causing the hash rates to remain fairly high, for sure.

It might be worded a bit differently, but it's not intentially misleading.  It still comes down to the fact that Coinbase provided Delighted with customers' email addresses.  
Here's a direct quote from the front page of Delighted.com:
"Simply provide us with the email addresses of some customers along with any special properties you’d like. No technical knowledge required! "
Additionally, Delighted is associated with Bain and Company, which describes their concern as:
"We advise global leaders on their most critical issues and opportunities: strategy, marketing, organization, operations, technology, digital, transformations and mergers &amp; acquisitions, across all industries and geographies."

I saw a different Coinbase scam email this morning that was posing as a customer satisfaction survey, and it was pretty slick looking.  I think the sending address was coinbase I'm not sure that was the exact name anymore though because I dumped it into the spam bucket and then deleted it several hours ago.
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:04:03
The problem is that Circle and many other exchanges are overreaching in their attempts to be compliant with the law.  Also,  the way in which they go about trying to obtain information is lame.  I signed up for an account, and after the account was created and before I ever had a single transaction with Circle, I started getting led down a path to giving them photo ID's with my SSN and utility bill copies, etc.  I don't trust them, they don't trust me and we end up in a standoff.  So, I have an account that I can't access and will never use.  These requests for documentation need to kick in when a threshold is crossed at the point the information is actually required by law, else I consider Circles' business model to be lacking and I don't do business with companies that appear to have half-baked strategies.  When I'm only selling like $2 worth of bitcoin every 3 or 4 days, they don't get that kind of information - ever.  I can buy and sell at my local computer club users group without giving away the keys to my life.

Coinbase gives information out about it's users to their business partners, like our account login ID's as if they were giving out candy.  I use them, but I do not trust them and if they ever start asking me for life facts, I'm done with them.  Bitcoin 2.0 will need to be about more anonymity, not less.

Absolutely, if they are going to accept deposits and refuse to release the funds until they have further documentation.  That's just wrong.  Now I can't say that is true for Circle from my experience (as I can't even access my account without documentation), but it's certainly true for BTCChina, where they basically stole my funds.  I can't wait to see them at the next conference, I'll be there and in their face and that's the way I roll.  If Bitcoin wants to grow, it better find some 'model' trading companies with respectable business practices.

Your missing the point.  I have to have security standards to follow, because it's best practices.

The Trezor is way too bulky and costs way too much for mainstream adoption of a secure BTC wallet.  With that said, at least Slush and company did something and I applaud them for it.
