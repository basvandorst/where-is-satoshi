Everything Stefan says has been debunked one way or another. He bases everything off lazy, warped, common sense reasoning and not scientific sociological analysis. He's a walking meme, giving twisted hope to politically wanderous or socially isolated young men.

A potential boyfriend cut it off because I was talking to him about btc. He doesn't like women who talk about finances, stocks, ect. I dodged a major bullet. Some people don't show their true colors until you open up

Do you guys spend your coins? Sometimes I kinda just wanna USE my btc even if it's just for a coffee or something. I wanna see it as a currency
@_date: 2019-11-15 19:40:25
I just went with electrum on tails. Works very well has what I need. I use it once a month to transfer btc from where I purchase it

I will answer this question legitimately. This is a question answered in any intro sociology or philosophy class in various forms. Interests and culture are a result of education, class, race, and gender. 
Ask yourself, "Why don't as many black people play soccer (in America) or hockey/baseball as they do basketball and football?". "Why is rock associated with white people and Hip Hop with black people"? 
There is not biological reasoning for this difference but socially there is. Different sports "reward" a black youth socially more than others. And different sports "reward" a white youth differently. Likewise, the act of listening to Hip Hop "socially rewards" a black person more than a white person. A black person listening to rock might even be question "why are you listening to rock??"
In this way we understand that tastes and culture are a combined RESULT of social education through class, race, gender, ect and not natural offshoots of biology, even if these tastes have been around for years and may see natural due to our legitimization. Trends and culture are reproduced thorough out active participation (fear of deviance) through generations. 
For instance, a old Forbes article I raid said women earn more on investments on average than men even though men trade WAY more than women. We don't know why that is but you could say risk socialization has something to do with it. Women being socialized to depend on others and take less risks therefore men taking poor risks on investments and women doing more research when they decide to invest based off a perceived "lack of performance" and need to do better. Although socialization theory is not the latest and best explanation for the magniruoof differences observed IRL. 
Also the gender stratification of video games is about 50/50 these days in terms of gender. Women are playing games at a near equal rate now.
Now, there will be people who say "hurr cuz femoidz jus be like dat"
But that is anti-intilectual and against what modern great minds have believed for the past hundred years.
Questions like why don't women do computer science, why don't women do this, why don't men do that, ect can be explained this way. They theories are well thought out on every level. You can do more research if you really believe.
TLDR: Because that's the trend women are reproducing currently.  AKA, society assigns a performance of masculinity an femininity, which changes from generation to generation. These can be detrimental at times. One constant thread through history is that men should slave and provide and women should birth and nothing else. This performance manifests and is reproduced through the time periods. One tendril of this performance is finances and risk taking (of which women are expected to be hands off OR to gather much of).

@_date: 2019-10-18 00:40:50
No I know. I'm using it right now but I'm looking for more good options. It gets it done but first choice was Samourai because of the UI.
@_date: 2019-10-15 00:56:51
Any news on Tails?
@_date: 2019-10-08 21:31:12
Hello, I'm a noob. I have $160 in btc from a financial aid refund ��. I used Cash App- yes Cash app to quickly purchase bitcoin. Will get a trezor or switch to paper at $200.
What's the point of coinbase?
@_date: 2019-10-18 15:32:21
Just try and keep to yourself. I started investing late at 10k and have only lost money so far. It sucks but people will focus on the negatives to make themselves feel better. When the money comes in, detractors suddenly become supporters.
@_date: 2019-10-16 02:33:04
Use cashapp please rather than Coinbase. If you so some recent research on this sub you'll see why. I only have $300 invested but cashapp is so easy to purchase from.

Ok. I'll keep using the electrum app. Sometimes I just wanna check my coins without staring up Tails
@_date: 2019-10-08 21:32:22
I use cash app. I have under $200 invested so I don't have a paper/hard wallet to transfer money to yet but it's so simple. No fees so far.
@_date: 2019-10-21 03:32:09
As someone else said, Samourai uses a different BIP that electrum. You can read up more about seed word compatibility online and on Samourai's site. There are some tutorials on how to get electrum to work with bip39 (using a legacy wallet I think)

Hey I'm a broke college student working a part time. I have very little to invest after paying tuition (what aid didn't cover). I invest in $10 increments when I have it. Sometimes once a week, others twice in two days. Do start with $5 and just go up from there!
Use cashapp to buy and they get a wallet when you've got &gt;$100 invested. Good luck
@_date: 2019-10-18 15:27:03
Thanks for the tip. I will use an offline electrum on my phone because I'm not using the app to do anything, just look at my wallet.

It's what I use. Instant purchase and transfers. I buy and then immediately press "withdraw" to my wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-18 00:57:49
Nice. I'll get one when I reach $1k. For now I'm using electrum on tails (when the 4.0 update drops).
@_date: 2019-10-12 00:58:05
Yeah when I first saw it I got scared that Square was holding me hostage for a minute
@_date: 2019-10-22 09:05:19
Started investing at $10k ��
Can't wait to see some gains soon.
