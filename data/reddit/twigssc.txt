You are right in that regard. Some people just aren't ready to hear. I don't mean that we should be proselytizing Bitcoin, but that we should be evangalists for the technology. While the two are very similar, I think that it is the way you go about it that makes the difference. I'm not telling the people around me that one day their currency will be worthless and unless they get on the Bitcoin train now, they will be left behind. I talk about the benefits that Bitcoin could bring to the unbanked in every single country. How it can change the remittance industry, and how it can bring power away from the central banks and back to the people. If they don't want to listen, fine, but you never know.

Agreed, we were all new to this at one point. What a lot of people don't recognize is that we were the early adopters. We are more technologically literate than a majority of the population. The fact of the matter is that Bitcoin IS confusing to other people, and the best thing that we can do to help our community is to be helpful to the people who are new to it.

*knock knock knock* Excuse me, sorry to bother you. Do you have a brief moment to learn about your lord and saviour, Bitcoin?

I think that you make an interesting point about meetups that perhaps you weren't intending to make. The fact is that the newbies at those meetups are going out of THEIR way to bring themselves into the Bitcoin world. While there certainly isn't a shortage of those kinds of people now, they will dry up. What lurkerdrop is saying, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that being nice to the people who come to us isn't enough. We should be the ones going out of our way to bring people in, not the other way around.

History is full of superior technologies that failed to gain mainstream succes and ultimately failed because their creators believed the benefits spoke for themselves.

ALL HAIL THE TROLLBOX!

I tested this out too, but I sent funds from dwolla to gox. It went through almost immediatly

Americans? Last time I checked, it's the entire world that has this problem.

The world market is currently 70 trillion dollars. Bitcoin is already valued greater than some small countries' currencies.
Edit: To the point, there is a greater than zero chance of that happening because it is possible, but I agree with your basic sentiment.

You never trust the trollbox...

I guessed that the site updates every 20 seconds, so I set my bot to pull data down on that interval. Every ~30 minutes I get an error that I can't connect. Is this a bug or a feature? 
Edit: If anyone is wondering, I helped write a Ruby library that wraps btc-e.com's api, and I'm working on a generic platform. DISCLAIMER: BOTH ARE STILL WORKS IN PROGRESS

This sentiment annoys me so much. Programmers have spent years honing their skills, and people like you want to hamstring them because its "not fair". guess what? Nothing is fair

Saying oh then don't use it is a terrible solution to a valid point...
