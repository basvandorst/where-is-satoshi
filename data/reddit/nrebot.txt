Hey, it seems you still have much to learn regarding economics. Come over to and we shibes will explain you how to reach the moon! :-)

Don't be sad shibe, there is much we can learn from bitcoin's failure. Now it's Dogecoin's turn to make things better!

People are finally realising that bitcoin failed and dogecoin is the future now! 
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:43:38

Lower class people with no investment experience should stay away from these things! 
@_date: 2014-09-28 05:31:04
It's actually deflation because more people want it than there are Dogecoins. Bitcoin has inflation because it died and nobody wants it. Just look at the price!

Which part of "2 year club" on my profile did you not understand? 
@_date: 2014-09-26 01:53:33
While I understand your anger you shouldn't forget that dogecoins value sometimes suffers because of bitcoins downfall when some people still trade doge for bitcoins. The doge community could be angry, too! 
@_date: 2014-10-23 08:04:32
People are buying into dogecoin since bitcoin is kinda dead now. I guess it's a matter of a few months until bitcoin will be fully replaced by doge.

he is not a futurologist but just some "designer" who knows what looks or sounds cool and is almost possible with current technology. also, google just likes the media attention this idiot brings them.


everybody talking about "Moore's law" immediately disqualifies himself. just another thing that sounds cool and is just scifi babble that coincidentally became a self fulfilling prophecy for some time now.

Don't worry shibe, dogecoin is taking the wheel! 
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:33:42
my degree in cs tells me you are either hilariously high, 12 years old or watching way too many scifi movies. or all of the above.
is that a real qualification yet? really?
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:23:27
No. Disappointments end in disappointment. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 02:04:56
Wow you are grumpy. I don't see bitcoin as an "enemy" and I said I am sad that bitcoin failed. I just asked for some tips because you guys were there when the first crypto was born! 
@_date: 2014-10-23 08:41:40
Nope. Truth hurts I know, fellow shibe. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 18:31:46
Don't be angry because bitcoin failed, come over and be a shibe!
