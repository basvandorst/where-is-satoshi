This is dodging the issue, isn't it? If the code isn't ran on the same network as the coin, why bother?


I'm strongly opposed to turing compete contracts, I feel it was etheriums main design flaw, its why flash needs to be/is being replaced its why html still exits.
Kiss principal goes double when running designing high risk/low trust environments, smart contracts need high accessibility not capability 


The dao didn't fall to a 51% attack, it was bad code, bitcoins main security advantage doesn't apply

Why are there not for pay playlists? A huge part of spotifys offering is that I don't actually have to mirco manage it and I remember rather liking xximortalimage youtube channel before it got shut down and would probaly pay 5 bucks or whatever to get access to that *list* just so i don't need to mirco manage as much

Nah; its shows that america is tryng radical ideas inside the little box its given "fuck this finatal crisis and the iraq war" "hey theres a black guy " "he wasn't all that different was he? lets try the guy who all the other guys laughed at"

That metaphor sucks; mining is a terrible name for the process
"Miners are keeping the network running, in extange they get a the new bitcoin and fee's"
Its more accurate and consist 


It's not every year, its every 4; misleading sentence 


can to; although hard, you'll probably see it done in etherium soonish


Due to the anonymous nature of Bitcoin, identity theft is effectively impossible. For a Bitcoin transaction to take place, an alphanumerical address is shared by each party. As this is the only information made public, a Bitcoin user’s personal data is kept private.
In theory yes, in practice no; the vast majority of addresses are tried to your bank account by the extanages

I like the muliplible people theory of satoshi, and its possible they agreed to "lose" the early coin to drive up the price and hide their identities, it would have been somewhat easy back when it was millions of coins got you a pizza and that may have made it look like a drug dealer

@_date: 2016-06-22 05:44:33
Well sure but your not going to see the bubble form just the price, you need to have at least 1 other data chart to make sense of it; for example when preditor/prey populations boom and bust its always a dance between the two, never a clean cycle.

Is there a coin under development with dumb contracts, I'm a little unclear why recursion is possible at all in a financial programming language; shouldn't it be so simple people scoff at the idea its programming at all?

Well qr images always have those squares in the corners, while I don't have that level of meta knowledge into image software, it should be possible to figure out which image software he used, then look up how the exact math of thier burring techniques; which in theory should give you a ton of leaked information about this password, for example there is alot of black space is the top left, its possible something like 80% of that data is "black"
(is that a 1 or a 0 in qr?) but that really cuts down the space, lets hope for op sake that the shade of grey doesn't give away anything
also the weird blurring off the edge of the card won't do him any favors
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:09:12
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:03:47
In practice people don't do any of that, its like bruteforcing passwords, capitalize the first letter and the number goes at the end you get the vast majority 
@_date: 2016-06-24 16:36:27
Well maybe, but doge is solely marketing, even if they picked the wrong target they nailed everything else.
Those contracts are interesting and even if all/most coins have them build in, etherium the first one to try making them usable even if they added nonsense to it; I feel it will stay around until someone writes a sensible contract langue and I don't even think anyone is working on one
