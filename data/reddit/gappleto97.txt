Until you think the following:
People have been shortening mBTC to "millibits" for a while now.
Now people are saying bits are worth a uBTC.
What's the value of a millibit then?  Things break down.

They...  They never said it was.  Italics for emphasis, not for examplification (&lt;- almost certainly not a word)
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:13:17
Three things:
First of all, fuck you.  You could at least talk to me like I'm a human being.  I *do* know what I'm talking about, because it's *not* my first day on this sub.
Secondly, China is incredibly inconsistent in policy on many things, so while that does meet the requirements that I set, I still don't see that as swaying evidence.
And lastly, what's to stop Ghash.io from saying it was an attacker, just like the last time they did **this exact thing** (even if that was with &lt;40% of the hashrate).  It doesn't take much effort to make it look like that would be true, either.
@_date: 2014-04-07 03:21:28
Am I the only one that's never seen it?
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:20:40
That's the idea I've seen bounced around.  You would need to have the protocol in a way where the latency is built in so that it's *hard set* to update at intervals that could accommodate *every* habitable rock in this system.  It would need update times of 20 hours or something like that if we wanted to get from Earth to, say, Titan, despite its obvious implausibility for settlement.
@_date: 2014-05-30 03:27:19
Except that it doesn't require large capital when pooled with something like p2pool, and then you can get away without worrying about centralization either.
So what's the problem?
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:35:56
Thank you.  And honestly, if I could just have someone who knows what's going on to talk to this about, I could probably figure it out.  I wonder if I was just connected to a fake node, or some billshit like that.
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:36:26
Two questions:
First, do you need to run a full node with this (I assume yes)?
And second, can you add your GPU and CPU in addition to your ASICs?  I can't seem to figure out how to do that in BFGminer.
@_date: 2014-07-06 05:55:01
Done.  I look forward to working with you :)
@_date: 2014-03-18 10:15:28
+@_date: 2014-01-10 03:02:14
That's not at all what he means.  P2pool is a separate network, which is linked by p2pool nodes, which is what you're talking about.

Unless you're Zeus.
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:14:48

That makes me think that GDP is a good place to look then.  As a conservative estimate you could say the money supply is $6bn (just under 2/3) and that would get you to a price of around 1000-1100.

True, but most of these pools are known.

The latter, and I expect the difference would be far greater.  If banks play the same prominent role they do now it would likely be on a scale of hundreds of times different, if not more.

Do a degree, yes.  Both anti-trust laws and a higher forced reserve would have possibly saved the greater economy a good deal of pain.  I don't know how much it would have helped this one corporation in particular, but it still would have protected consumers, which is the heart of the issue here.

Can we please stop calling people trolls?  Aside from not helping the conversation, it's fairly obvious that everyone here is serious about their claims.
Besides, a more honest series of events would be as follows:
The banks do something stupid.
People realize the banks are going to fail, and give them money, to avoid a far larger fallout.
The banks do something stupid with the money.
The bailouts, whether they had that effect or not, were never intended to be a reward for anything, they were to prevent additional losses from an overgrown system with too many dependencies on a near-monopoly service.
@_date: 2014-06-09 10:20:03
There are things you can do though...
One example would be p2pool.

I'm not concerned about cheating in a window that small, I'm thinking more about distribution times and convenience.
If you know that your payment will be finalized within 3 hours, it's much nicer than 24.
Not to mention that it would spread the work of these transactions throughout the day, instead of having miners play catchup for 18 hours.  This would have the effect of making transaction fees more stable.

Faster is this concern.  Bigger is a given.  Until SSDs drop below ~50¢/GB, it won't be cost-effective to store it on that, so the hope is that they'll come up with a 10k+rpm HDD, which would speed up reads and writes.

But it would damage overall trust and show that it's actually feasible to perform a 51% attack.  Now that new businesses and such are actually paying attention, this can only cause long term damage.

All changes received by miners during one block are reserved for the next, and because of the propogation times, you aim for crazy times like one block per day.  Combat the slowness with lots of compression, making less data available (ie no notes), and having no file size limit.

So here's my problem:
I'm a tiny miner.  Completely insignificant on the larger scale.  A mere 1 GHash.  It's almost not worth running.  *Almost*.
Thing is, I want that to be on p2pool, but even though it says it's accepting my shares, I have never gotten a single payout from them, even while being on in that 4-in-3-day period. 
At slush, I get paid.
Is this because p2pool doesn't like miners below a certain amount, or is this that "variance" that everyone keeps talking about.  If so, that's not the normal definition of the word. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:27:09

Imagine if the network gets flooded with 10,000,000 transactions at the end of each day.  The miners are adding a ton of them  to the blocks, starting with the highest fees.  They would then sort until they reached a much lower price, only to raise itself at the end of they day.  This creates a cyclical price change that wouldn't be very tolerable, and spreading that throughout the day would fix that.
Edit: 10,000,000 is probably an unrealistic number, but it's within a couple orders of magnitude.

It wouldn't, but then again, you already have to trust them to not install malware through the extension, not provide malicious ads, not store your search terms, etc.
Basically, you're moving the trust you're normally putting toward google, and giving it to them.  How this isn't obvious is a mystery to me, but I still think it would be worth it to put it on my computer, since I don't have any significant data stored on my everyday use one.

Not to mention that they still tie it to "business days" despite being managed mostly by computers, and despite numerous attempts to reform this.
Bitcoin on the other hand, has a seemingly good solution to it.  While I don't think it's anywhere near perfect, it still seems to be the best solution so far.  It might be better for me to have said that "crypto will win in the long run", rather than specifying Bitcoin.

Actually, the same thing could happen in p2pool in that scenario.  They would only need to get at the majority of p2pool's hashpower.  And since a lot of people mining there aren't using their own nodes, this makes it more possible.
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:02:41
This is great, but until p2pool can work for small miners (&lt;10 GHash), then you're leaving out a good portion of the market, as far as headcount goes.
I went three days on p2pool and never received a single payment.  It was definitely accepting shares.  I waited.  I never got paid.
Until things like that can be fixed, as in problems with actual implementation, it won't become popular, even if it should be.

So, let me see if I understand this correctly:
The main reason I would buy at best buy, rather than somewhere cheaper, is their warranty.  However, you guys get it from other places as well, if I use your service, and it's cheaper there.  This means that I cannot get their extended warranty, which although it's fine on some things, is significantly less so on say, a new SSD.
Is that a correct summary?
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:49:18
Does this change if you go through a third-party node?  I imagine the difficulty would be different there, based on the reported hashrate, maybe?
@_date: 2014-06-19 02:41:20
I think p2pool needs to be improved first.  More shares included in payouts, and shares coming more often.  As it is, small miners already can't get payouts.  For instance, I only have a 0.1% chance of being paid on any particular block there.  That's way too much variance to be acceptable, and that's while it's only at 1 PH/s.  Imagine if it had the rate of the whole network.

@_date: 2014-06-17 13:26:59
Actually, there's a lower threshold where you make nothing on p2pool.  I learned this the hard way.  It's honestly an awful system for small miners because of its design.  If there can only be 1000 shares paid out, there is going to be a *fuckton* of variance, even for larger miners. 
If it weren't too late, I would call for a redesign.  And once this one gets off the ground, a competing one needs to be made in a better model with less variance.

For me it's that you can only have one secure coin of each hash type.  Bitcoin has forever (save for a fatal flaw) secured itself as the largest hashrate of the SHA256 coins, just as Litecoin seems to have done the same with scrypt.
The reason this is true, is because if any reasonable portion of the Bitcoin network decided to try, they could probably overwhelm an altcoin with a 51% attack.  In fact, this happened recently (but I can't remember which alt it was).

It's a different challenge every year, but this year it's most closely comparable to soccer, but with 2-foot diameter balls, which are slightly wider than the average robot is allowed to be (unless you custom make your chassis, which wastes precious time, in our minds at least).  It also has an element of volleyball in it, in that if you launch it above a ~6 foot high bar you get extra points, and quiddich, in that the high scoring goals are also ~6 feet off the ground.
Last year we were supposed fire frisbees into goals of similar heights, and the bonus score was to try and climb a jungle-gym pyramid.

Two ideas there:
First, punching in triggers a timer.  Punching out ends the timer.  You are paid based on how long the timer went.
Second, make it so that that the wallet that accepts your paychecks *only* accepts your paychecks.  This would make it trivial for a simple application to tally up the total amount you earned.

Does it really matter what they do?  The entire point of this system is to remove trust from currency in general, yet this would just make it so that one person could decide how the entire currency works.  It could be significantly worse than PayPal or the FED.
The fact that a single individual can make decisions like this is why it needs to be acted against.

It ended up being easier to just find a design solution around that.  We firmly believe in the mobility of the long chassis design, and find it much nicer to have a driving robot by the fourth or fifth meeting, than we do to design a chassis around a not-yet-fully-thought-out superstructure.  In the end, having that layer of certainty smooths out the process for us.

If this is gonna work properly, you're gonna need a few things:
A) have escrow set up as multisginiture transactions.  Ie, 2/3 of the parties need to sign it.  That way, if a product is not received, a support personnel can reverse the transaction.
B) require tracking numbers, in order to assist in the above requirement.
C) support personnel (I'd be willing to work for you)
D) a public forum/rating system, to prevent scamming even more that the above features.

The ones that let you pick fees still need to go within certain parameters.  Not all transactions can be made free.
Even after that, however, paying a lower fee increases the confirmation time enormously.  A 20¢ fee took me ~36 hours to go through, last week.  The week before a similar one took 18 hours.  These are serious problems if we want merchants to actually accept this.

While I'm impressed that you took the time to do this, I have to say that I don't particularly want the government involved, not for my ideals, but because of the enormous economic experiment going on here.
Think about it: this is the first currency that's entirely unregulated.  If anything, it could help us get a better understanding of basic economic principles, and it's for this reason that I've been participating in bitcoin.  I love the idea, and I want to see what happens.
If it wins, which I think it will, then hooray.  If it loses, then se la vi.
So yeah.  I'm just saying that this is valuable economic data, if nothing else.

Doesn't work on bitcoinQT, and you can't choose the fee on the mobile blockchain app.  In addition, not all transactions can be free.  It depends on a few variables, some of which you can't see.
Iirc, it's size of transaction &gt;= 1kB, total output &gt;= 0.01 BTC (I think it's lower now), and the priority is above some arbitrarily calculated number.
In other words, you don't know the size of the transaction, the amount you send isn't always the output, and you never see the priority until after the transaction (at least on blockchain that's true).

On the other hand, I've always looked at miners as a *long-term* deal.  That's why I've never given those miner-haters any real credence.
My apologies if I mistook you for one of them, I probably ought to have reconsidered before implying it.

No, it's just outlining the fact that we haven't invested in banking infrastructure since the mid-60's.  And by the time we had flash memory, we also had Ethernet, so the point would have been moot.

Your point about FRB is incorrect.  While nobody is saying that this is in the blockchain system, that doesn't make it impossible.  All that anyone is saying is that fractional reserve banking is in fact possible in the Bitcoin ecosystem, so long as there isn't a bank run.
For instance:
Rather than having individual wallets, a storage service has one, and you get accounts for it.  Every so often they give a blah% bonus for being with them.  When you request money, you see how much is in your account, and they transfer what you request from the main wallet.  Any remaining funds they can invest how they choose.
While this is outside of the blockchain, everyone seems to agree in that respect.  How is this not fractional reserve banking?

It was more to create a semi-cold wallet for storage than it was to keep my IP secret.  I just figured that three-factor authentication on a physical device that can only get access to the net through TOR would be more secure than a piece of paper.  Besides, this way you can have two copies and still not need to worry.

The point behind this is that for every risk you take, there ought to be a safety measure behind it.  For instance, investing in Bitcoin means that there should be a corresponding investment in a long-term investment like gold or *some* stocks.  By the same logic, if your portfolio is very low risk, you can feel justified in putting more into a high risk.  
Tl;dr: diversity == safety.

In any case, I'm a firm believer that textbooks can only teach so much, and having incentives like an investment you believe in can work wonders in that department.

Not true.  While I'm pretty well versed in SI (I'd have to be to be in AP Chem), I still prefer the idea of a bit, if only because I know *so many people* who would hate the idea of using SI prefixes.  And besides, while I'm fine with using Milibits as my standard word choice before now, to do the same with micro- would have some negative connotations that the OP is right about for mainstream society (which is the ultimate goal in the end).
Besides, even if you just assume that intelligence is distributed on a normal curve, there's still a pretty good chance that SI familiarity is above the 70th percentile for a good deal of places.  Probably 80th here in America.

It's not actually that expensive if you go to the right places.  I don't know where he eats, but around here you can usually get a good meal for $6-$18 depending on where you go.  As low as $4 if you make it yourself (although that's a little low even for estimation).  I think he might mean meals for a family, though, so that could make sense.  The most expensive place we go on any regular basis (once or twice a year) is ~$30 a person.  But hey, Cajun cooking is both good and rare around here, so I'll take it for that price.

Um...  Let's see if I can pull a decent explanation here...
ASIC is an acronym that I can't actually remember right now.  It's something like Advanced Specialized Integrated Circuit.  Basically, it means that it's *amazing* at what it does, but can only do one thing.  This means that it can get the same amount of hashing done as your graphics card, for a small percentage of the power.  In some cases a percent of a percent.
They're selling for ridiculously large amounts of money compared to a few months ago, you'll be lucky to find one less than $60, but it's certainly cheaper than the equivalent graphics card, and definitely less electricity.
Does that clear it up at all?

Tails isn't good for cold-storage. However, that being said, I have set up a "lukewarm" wallet that syncs over TOR.  It doesn't always work properly (as in it sometimes syncs over regular networks instead) but I just did it as an experiment, really.  I wouldn't recommend storing large amounts like that, but I would recommend that you use electrum on it.

@_date: 2013-11-26 19:06:58
That could have been said with much less anger.  I get it's bad, but there's no need to insult someone personally unless they're outright ignoring their advisors.  Usually it's safer and more appropriate to blame the group as a whole.

I'm guessing it doesn't work with URLs however, because every time I try to add the bitcoin:// to the beginning, like in every payment request I've seen from blockchain.info, it gives me errors.
Edit: tried normal blockchain address, and it was too long, so I used google's URL shortener and now it works just fine.

No, that is in fact an appropriately harsh statement about our terribly run state.  It just goes to show that you can't run on the same principles for 300 years.  They need to update the constitution, but I don't trust our representatives with that responsibility.  That just continues the cycle of pain.

Nobody is saying that this is in the blockchain system.  All that anyone is saying is that fractional reserve banking is in fact possible in the Bitcoin ecosystem, so long as there isn't a bank run.
For instance:
Rather than having individual wallets, a storage service has one, and you get accounts for it.  Every so often they give a blah% bonus for being with them.  When you request money, you see how much is in your account, and they transfer what you request from the main wallet.  Any remaining funds they can invest how they choose.
While this is outside of the blockchain, you two are both agreeing in that respect.  How is this not fractional reserve banking?

It's not showing up because on average there's a 0.5-2Mhash difference between actual and effective rates.  That means that it isn't showing because slush isn't even getting it.

I agree, but the transaction fees are starting to get a bit too big.  I mean, I spent 20¢ for a 18 hour transaction between my own wallets.  Isn't that a little steep?

Y'know, despite this being an obvious question, I'm gonna answer it anyways:
You get what you payed for at that time.
Also, you're getting downvoted because the same principle applies to gas.  You can't go back to the station for a reimbursement just because it cost more the previous day, can you?

Other than the green addresses I agree with you.  The problem with that is that as soon as you have that sort of list, every government agency in the world suddenly knows exactly how much money you have/spend/make, without even a little effort.  How is that a good thing?

Oughtn't you store the Bitcoin as bitcoin, then convert when spent?  Otherwise, what's the difference between this and a gift card?
@_date: 2013-11-03 06:18:24
Set the standard currency to mBTC.  Otherwise it measures in denominations of $200/€150/¥2000, all of which are equally annoying to deal with, and equally inconvenient to pay for things in.

Sure!  The numbers [ 2),2,2)] refer to the table number, then the xy coordinates on the table.  So if you go to the website and look at the table, just change the numbers to refer to that box.

Yes, but until it becomes a major part (even 5%) of the economy that can't actually be solved, because people will think of BTC in terms of dollar value, just like Americans do with Euros, and vice versa for Europeans and British.

I'm sixteen, and because my parents disapprove I've been severely limited in my options, so let me describe how I got my ~m฿33. 
1) I got an ASIC miner.  It's not a great source of income, but in the long term (talking over the course of a year) it pays for itself a couple ties.  This depends on luck and if you have a spare computer, like I did, but since our parents pay for electricity, this becomes mildly profitable.
2) I used faucets.  Lots of faucets.  Faucets are sites that basically pay you to show ads, and they actually get you a decent amount of money, considering its free.  On the other hand, it almost never gets you large amounts.  I think my biggest payout was μ฿100.
3) reddit.
Yes, reddit can get you Bitcoin  if you go on you'll find people who are sometimes willing to tip substantial amounts of money (I got m฿20 once) for doing various things, as well as other people looking for donations.  Honestly, I'd like to find one that's more buyer-request oriented, but this works for now.
Of the options above, 3 is the most profitable, and 2 is the most reliable.  On the other hand, 1 allows you to support the system without too much burden on yourself.  After all, even small contributions count, and don't let someone tell you otherwise.
By the way, if anyone had an alternative to I'd love to hear about it.
Hope this helps!
