What exchange trades this Cybercash?

I say don't listen to anybody and do your own research.
@_date: 2019-07-05 22:01:53
OP don't listen to anybody who ignorantly tells you to straight up avoid altcoins. Most are trash but there are a lot that are working on solving problems that Bitcoin can't solve.
BTW OP wasn't even talking about altcoins so why even say that?

Buying BTC on Coinbase literally couldn't be easier, it's like checking out on Amazon, not sure how much more technologically proficient you'd need to be to do that.
Buying a mutual fund on my 401k...I have no idea how to even do that.

You paid almost a 5% fee and got the convenience to be able to walk into any Western Union to get the cash, on the spot. 
How much more trouble would it have been to have your family sign up with an exchange with a fiat offramp, verify their account, link an approved bank account, recieve the BTC, sell the BTC on the market and then withdraw that to their bank (assuming they even have a bank and assuming the bank is crypto friendly)?
Western Union sounds like the better option, at this very moment. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:56:19
Could my mom do this though? Would you feel safe sending your parents money overseas and telling them to 'go sell them locally on LB'? 
I wouldn't. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 06:57:48
Fake out. Volume is paltry.
@_date: 2018-08-31 05:21:58
Exactly. My point is RIGHT NOW AT THIS MOMENT it's easier to use Western Union and the 5% fee is the cost of convenience. It's easier to use WU than to transact BTC&gt;Fiat. I'm sure this will all be changing in the future. We are still VERY early though.
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:53:19


99% of us normal people out here. Most people receiving money from oveseas need that money to live off and it's just too difficult, expensive and risky to live strictly off bitcoin right now to even make it a viable option. I understand where people want things to move to but the fact is that right now, at this moment, it doesn't work like that. Fiat rules. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 19:50:10
I have a feeling this is a way for the business to tack on an extra fee to get the illusion of a faster transaction. I can't remember ever paying with PayPal, bank transfer or a debit card and it taking 3 days to show up. 
OP, what website/company is this?
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:58:48
Never heard of this website. Is this strictly sending fiat from bank to bank? 1 minute scanning the website and I'm not sure exactly how money gets from point A to B.
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:50:59
I definitely see quality exchanges, like Binance, being the future banks. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 19:47:19
The company is adding that on top. 
Anyone here who thinks that a business won't tack on extra fees for processing Bitcoin also is delusional.

Becuase Bitcoin wouldn't be priced anywhere near $7k if it wasn't highly manipulated and fraudulent....
@_date: 2018-08-31 02:22:55
Do you seriously think that? Have you ever signed up for a Coinbase account and linked up your bank account and tried to withdraw funds? I don't think you have because it's more time consuming (I'm not talking about registering for Binance) and takes a lot longer than finding a local Western Union agent (literally everywhere, in most countries).

How old is your friend, 16? If you're buying a cheap used car in person just go pull the damn cash out before you go what's so 'inconvenient' about that. Ohhh, he's 'too busy' to stop by a bank and spend 15 minutes getting cash? Pfff, ok. 
Or at the minimum, have some experience with PayPal and mobile bank transfers to understand the process and it's limitations.

On Bitfinex you can redeem your USDT for USD, there is no distinction. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 03:15:53
Bitfinex has fiat deposits and withdrawals if you are verified - no USA users though (unless you had an old account but technically this isn't allowed). Bitfinex is my favorite exchange BY FAR. Robust AF!
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:28:35
On Bitfinex you can withdraw as much crypto as you want with zero verification. Verification is only required for users wishing to deposit/withdraw *fiat* currencies.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:54:50


On Bitfinex you can. They offer fiat withdrawals. 
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:54:31
If a recession hits and people are struggling 1) they won't have disposable income to put into Bitcoin 2) they won't be investing in such a new volatile/speculative asset 3) people who actually own crypto would probably be inclined to liquidate their coins to pay for living expenses. My thoughts but I don't know shit, lol.
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:15:06


Only the people who are already exposed to Bitcoin/cryptocurrency would even consider that and that's a very small percentage of us, we are still very early. My parentsarent going to liquidate their retirement accounts and move into magic internet money.

@_date: 2018-06-15 04:48:25
I don't know exactly how Bitfinex works on the backend, whether their USD is actually USDT and then swapped when cashing out (nobody seems to know) but what I do know is that they have fiat pairs (USD, EUR, JPY, GBP) you can deposit and withdraw to and from your bank account. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 08:40:39
There's no reason why you can't show both sats and usd. Unfortunately this probably will just hurt your sales instead of raise awareness or promote adoption. Also, if your goal is to get new people into crypto then you need to have some info on there for noobs. Consider putting up some info about how to actually purchase bitcoin easily - put yourself into the shoes of someone coming to your site, who doesn't own bitcoin. You only accept bitcoin, they don't have any and they want a shirt, so how do they get it? Also, please for the love of god fix the letter case/capitalized words. It's not consistent and hurting my head. Either do all camel case or only the first letter of every sentence, not a mix.

There's only two possibilities and both are mistakes made by you.
1. You bought a Trezor that was tampered with. Where did you buy the Trezor? Did you practice resetting and restoring the cold wallet before actually putting money on it?
2. Someone got a hold of your wallet and your seed. I highly doubt you have your wallet on you 24/7, within your sight, at all times. Please remind us why you thought it would be a good idea to hand write your seed down and put it in your wallet?
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:38:21
I can't explain it but from my understanding of these types of situations, typically they auction off the asset or sell it otc, not dump it on the market.

I understand there are special situations where people get trully fucked by the government here for no reason and it makes their life a temp living hell but for most people it shouldn't be an issue, and most people aren't travelling with ten's of thousands of dollars in cash.

I mean, a lot of people do that in the US also but you only hear about the very small minority that get fucked for no reason (and that sucks but it's not perfect here). It doesn't mean America is a 'third world shithole' with a 'totally defunct justice system'. My point is that I'd rather get caught with 10k in my pocket in the US vs. a third-world country because you will probably get it back (yes it may take a while, might not though). Anywhere else and you can kiss that money good bye!

Yeah I know, but when you're in custody and the feds have been watching you for years and know exactly what you've done and how much you have (you know btc is traceable and not anonymous right?) and they're pressuring you into giving up the location of your private keys (because we all know that it's not in your head and written down somewhere, assuming they didn't find it after they raided your crib) you don't think 99% of people are going to piss their pants and buckle? These criminals obviously are because there are tons of articles of Bitcoin being seized. You can't just tell them you forgot the key or lost the paper or just be quiet (you do know what obstruction of justice and perjury are, right?) - they will fuck you real good. You're not smarter than them.
