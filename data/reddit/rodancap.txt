I believe the way to get the private key, is by doing a backup , if you go into the less common backup options. You may also want to think about importing your private key into a newer version of the software as well.

I don't get what you are drinving at. There are two ways of getting bitcoins, one is through mining, and the other one is through purchases. If somebody is selling bitcoins, they either mind them, or they purchased them from somebody else.  These markets can happen with a rise in price, or with a decline in price. What's your point?

The supply of many other non-valuable things is also fixed. I painted a nice painting of my little cat, it's Supply is very fixed, by your definition I should be a millionaire. There is an even more important factor to this equation, and it is the demand from consumers. The supply of iPhones is not fixed, but they're more valuable than my painting. That is because there is significant consumer demand.

I just read from this other poster that there's a new developer. I didn't know that. But regardless, I really think your coins are safe. I do not think safety is an issue with armory cold storage. The question was whether you were going to have access to new types of transactions like segregated Witness , or if perhaps you would run into compatibility problems ( like the Bitcoin Network rejecting your transactions, and having to migrate your coins to a different wallet)  because of lack of development. I might be wrong, but I really think safety is not the issue. Personally I'm waiting for a little while before I make any decisions. It's by far the best solution.
@_date: 2016-06-10 18:47:13
 They talk as if the people that want to scale differently aren't concerned about scalability and not concerned about the blocks being full. They spent like half an hour talking about all the delays and loss of convenience related to delayed transactions, as if the camp that does not agree with them is just fine and dandy with it. Nothing could be further from the truth, but there are some technical dangers related to hard Forks. They never addressed these risks. If we end up with two blockchains and double spends, that will be much more of a consumer disruption than this temporary growing pain that were experiencing now.

Spend a few dollars and purchase a license for Authenticator Plus.  It doesn't have the dependency on the phone number like Authy,  and it allows you to back up to Dropbox or Google Drive so that you can have the same authenticator in more than one device. Also if you lose your device you can use the backup to have access to your accounts. Make sure that you have two-factor authentication on Dropbox if you're going to use it as a backup Tool. If you're really paranoid you can move your Dropbox file offline

You are confusing two different kinds of inflation. The gold inflation figure that you quote is basically what is call money supply growth. Then the US dollar figure that you quote is the consumer price inflation (cpi) not the USD money supply growth. 
Without getting into technicalities of why consumer price inflation is a government manipulated figure, money supply growth and consumer price inflation are just two different animals. You're not comparing apples to apples. The word inflation has two different meanings.
If you keep it apples to apples, the money supply growth in gold is indeed 2%. And the u.s. dollar money supply growth at the current date stands at around 4.5%, and in the last 10 years it has been as high as 10%. This does not even include credit growth.
Please look at the figures.
 
Regarding the inflation rate of Grin, the quote from one of the developers that was interviewed in a podcast, was that they did not want the value of grin to rise. They did not want people to just hold it as an investment, but to spend it and circulate it.
 not only does this denote a total lack of economic understanding (which tells me that I should not invest in this coin) but it also tells us that they will take measures to keep the coins from gaining value. Not good news.

1) off-chain does not mean centralized. You can have a fully decentralized network that is off-chain, like the marijuana distribution system around the world. You cannot take it down by caging a drug-lord.
2) lightning is an on-chain settling smart contract. A lightning node operator CANNOT TAKE YOUR COINS, whoever told you otherwise is lying to you (r/btc ??). So I am not sure what kind of fraud you are talking about. Misuse is a part of life, in fact, it is happening right now with on-chain stuff as well (Jihan mining empty blocks for example). 
3)  What "endpoints" are you talking about?  The user can close the lightning channel and settle. There is no channel without a way out for the user.

 Seniorage, as a form of maintenance for currency that wears out, or as a way to bring a new currency into existence is one thing. The bank of England did this when they were on the gold standard, and the pound kept its purchasing power.
Fractional Reserve banking on the other hand is a very different story. You are creating huge amounts of debt/currency out of thin air, thereby shifting resources from savers towards government and government friends. This is confiscation through inflation.
