Nice: "The blockchain is a wild card that could completely overhaul financial services. Both major banks and startups around the world are exploring the technology behind the blockchain, which stores and records Bitcoin transactions. This technology could lower the cost of many financial activities to near-zero and could wipe away many traditional banking activities completely."

Joe needs a cheap car plus Craigslist tools and YouTube to fix it. 
Joe needs a  cheap house in a bad area plus tools and YouTube. Joe should commute, earn, work, and side hustle. Upgrade.
Joe could invent, innovate, or just put in massive hours at a company and pack his lunch.
Joe could be polite, considerate, timely, reliable, humble and kind to people and start basically any home service company in a boom town on crsigslist. 
Joe should opt out of situations which require credit and forget about dogshit debt prison.
Joe should travel to a country where he can afford medical care but firstly be safe, eat healthy and practice self care.
Edit: Joe should treat the legal system as a noose and realize encounters with law enforcement likely leads to a tighter knot around his own neck. Joe should avoid police and shut his mouth.

A duplicate coinbase account will get you busted.  Go somewhere else like localbitcoins or libertyx to double down. It's not "your" blockchain BTW it's your wallet. Move your coins to cold storage, the Ledger wallet "nano s" will safely store your coins off of coinbase

I use a few services and exchanges to spread counterparty risk while locking my bitcoin into USD value (coinapult, tether) or Shapeshift.io into a shit coin temporarily, then buy back.  None of these insulate me from total crypto meltdown and I dont want dollars so I'm thinking of buying a little gold at jmbulion because they do accept btc    
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:02:48
Yes, The Ledger wallet  is a piece of hardware that manages access to your bitcoin, which are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. Coinbase.com will work for managing your access (and selling you bitcoin) until you can obtain your own personal bitcoin vault aka hardware wallet aka Ledger/Nano S or other brand/model. Hope that helps!

Satoshi is like the federal reserve. By releasing some of his coins into circulation, he could imitate effects of inflation in a hyperbitcoinized world. This is a problem in my mind.

Agreed centralized exchanges are not fun but realize your government is causing this, including he gagged responses. They are legally required to not tell you the reasons so you can't potentially game the system later.  We should all use p2p exchanges anyway.

Worth it. It's so badass.  Money from my customers' stupid credit cards turns into bitcoin in my wallet with a few taps. I can top up my custom stupid visa card with bitcoin super easy, but you know I transfer goatshit fiat from my bank account firstly. All from my phone in moments. All in all its a great service from a great supporter of this space.

Coinbase is not a friend of BTC, evident in the way the CEO handled bcash launch and eth flippening.
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:24:01
Yes one exchange account can have many different receiving adresses. Always test with small amounts first if you are not 100% certain.
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:18:11
Coinbase is generally misaligned with this community's values. Gemini and Square support BTC. The CEO of Coinbase has made some untrusteorthy moves over the years. See how they handle bcash and flippening
@_date: 2019-10-04 01:27:45
My customers are the best, never had one since Square launched. Surely it would come out of a connected bank account or available balance like PayPal does it.

Yeah, then merchants will unwittingly accept bitcoin. It's genius
@_date: 2019-10-27 22:41:10
Super easy on Gemini.com or download Squarecash app. Avoid Coinbase for karma. The tricky part is the next optional but highly recommended step of storing it in your own personal vault. Use a hardware wallet.

It's word play demostrating the irony, my point and 100% accurate. Ledger uses a wallet back up which is paper. Here, a paper wallet back up. Likely my greatest post ever.

...which is a paper wallet backup

While still not a "paper wallet," this device creates a paper wallet backup by default.  I love my ledger but this is... ironic.

Go to Progresso, Mexico. Walk across from Weslaco, Texas. It's super easy and modern. Root canal $500 total. Deep cleaning- $240. Cleanings $35.  Implants $2000 per tooth. Alpha Dental in Progresso, Mex is on Google maps. Highly recommend to all my family and friends.

@_date: 2019-12-24 20:03:11
Yes my cousin who won the gift in 2015 called me for "back up codes" in 2017 because he had lost the paper slip and his wallstreet investment buddy told him if I made it, I had a backup. $20 white elephant turned into a $600 mistake.  He was suspicious when I said I didn't have the back up, which I didn't. Not fun particularly.

It's not better for strictly hodling.  One's paper wallet can be encrypted so it's more secure than writing the seed in plain text, like with a hardware wallet.

True enough. Now consider handing out paper wallets with a few bucks on them to interested people you know. You can give keys to one account; it's almost like cash that the receiver can trust as much as they trust you. Again, I love my hardware wallet but we shouldn't forget about the liberty and safety paper wallets provide, and for no charge. A dice-generated hand written paper wallet imo is most trusty option too.  IDK how to verify Ledger code.
@_date: 2016-09-30 13:54:50
Use mycelium trader, bitsquare, libertyx, or localbitcoins. ATMs here in the USA are not anonymous
@_date: 2016-09-30 13:52:26
Use their installer usb device or initialize the wallet from a Linux live OS. Initialize from a secure environment, not an old windows machine. Afterwards, you can use any computer to access the wallet.

Imo they have gathered enough ill-will from the community so that the downvotes won't stop. I cancelled my account over a year ago when they constantly cancelled buys after 4 days of holding my funds. They tried to fork the coin. They raised thier fees. They have some Bitcoin patents which some dislike. They seem to go way overboard with know your customer's law compared to many others. The ETH/C debacle. 
TL;DR:  tipping point, winds of shit are blowing on coinbase
