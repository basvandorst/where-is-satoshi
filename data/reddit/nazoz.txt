Well, one thing is for sure; bitcoin is certainly not the next bitcoin.

That is totally not how any of this works, i recommend reading up some more on bitcoin, no, economics, before making such claims.

What does that even mean? The energy of multiple US households over what time?

what "suckers"? Bitcoin is a new technology, and will change and improve in every aspect.

Thank you, but id rather not do that. Im more so looking for an easy way to make a wallet that i can just hand over to them on a piece of paper.
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:14:05
Thats 0.0029 BTC/kB

To get the private key id have to export the wallet to a file and decrypt the contents. I dont trust using an online decrypter for that. I've written the backup code bitpay uses on a piece of paper, so he can reopen it on his own computer.

I want to give away some bitcoin as a gift. What is the best way to turn an amount of bitcoin into a private key i can give as a gift?

I meant 0.0006554, which  says is the fastest and cheapest fee.

I made 2 bitpay wallets, backed them up as the 12 words you can import your wallet as, in bitpay. Should i ask the recipients to open up these wallets again as they recieve them, or is it likely that they can just keep it in paperform, and have no problem with retrieving them in the case that bitpay ever close down?

Ok, thank you!
@_date: 2017-09-24 12:47:48
I guess i should change to another wallet then, which one do you use?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:12:50
The size is 226 bytes, which the website i mentioned calculates the fee from.

I've sent it already, but thanks for the help!
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:05:01
So, this is bitcoin that is sent back to another address, that is a part of my wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:22:33
Thanks, i see potential in bitcoin, so i guess i'l invest.
