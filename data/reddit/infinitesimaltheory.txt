Look for it over at github.com there are a ton of tools that can help you.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:30:58
Look for transaction accelerators.

Bcash isn't sold on Bitcoin.com, you get bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:37:54
Congratulations ��

You can import it into the new electrum release.

Why is Roger Ver a scam artist? Although i don't even care about him. Has bitcoin.com ever scammed you?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:50:32
There's no better explanation about the paper than from Satoshi himself

Why is bitcoin.com a scam?
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:08:46
How come?

You need to check that your wallet supports Bitcoin Cash.

Take for example you are one the top executives at Google, and they are coming up with a new car self-driving technology and planning to release it to the public. If you were to disclose that information with someone who then buys a position on Google before the release day of the new technology, that would be Insider Trading (Trading with inside information). The Google stock would for sure raise higher and you would (possibly) split the gains.
I'm not saying this is what exactly happened with Coinbase (People buying Bitcoin Cash cheap knowing that Coinbase was going to facilitate BCH buying), but looking at the market we could see an orchestrated maneuvering in the order of that idea.

This fight is rather meaningless. I pm'ed MrBeanCoin and he was helpful with my problem.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:19:17


Definitely not illegal here. Bitcoin is not regulated by financials or gubernatorial entities, so they have no say in the matter. This is one of the reasons Bitcoins Futures is a thing.

I don't want to bring the whole Bitcoin vs Bitcoin cash discussion into it. He may have good reasons to buy it and you good reasons to why he shouldn't but the post is asking something unrelated.
You should check either **Exodus** which can accept several alt coins or **Electron Cash** which doesn't require downloading a full node.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:30:57
It would take you a few months to do that + counting the fees and verification process if you don't have any accounts on any exchange. 
At this point i would recommend you to start your own exchange which deals with USD to BTC or taking advantage of the liquidity of other coins (although they are still based on BTC mostly) but i don't know the regulation of your country or if you are willing to establish a company in another (tax permissive).
The exchanges which deal with the highest volume BTC/USD are Bitfinex, GDAX, Bitstamp and Gemini.

You don't have to download the entire blockchain to use a wallet. You should import your private key to another wallet like Electrum.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:31:59
Do explain yourself better, please.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:37:41
There ain't only two kinds of folk anywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:56:35
It would be rather impractical to sell the bitcoins, then you would be disclosing your cash + your gains. It's better to transfer your bitcoins to another wallet (not exchange nor web wallet).
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:19:39
then go to this: 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:24:17
This are the two blocks that mined your TX with the same input  one shows as confirmed.
If you didn't try to spend your BTC twice you should check with your wallet support and/or import your private keys to another wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:00:32
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:16:12
In most cases no one really loses something.
You agree to buy 1 bitcoin for someone agreeing to sell it for 15k then the same thing to another person for 16k. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:31:41
First you should tell me why is centralized and why it couldn't possible use bitcoin name. (I don't want to argue, you may change my idea on the topic actually)
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:25:00
That, at the moment is $228.95 USD. You can exchange it for an altcoin although the market is coming back from a dip and is difficult that an altcoin is going to recover better than bitcoin but possible.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:45:28
mmm if you can get your Bitcoin Cash, you should check top exchanges where you can deposit BCH or do a conversion first through several websites.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:06:45
not stuck in limbo. Once you sync, and get to the block which mined your transaction you should be able to see your new balance.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:30:53
It doesn't really matter. The whales selling is a good thing for bitcoin (more decentralization) also the intent to buy is still present, if people are selling, people will buy.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:07:08
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:40:58
04 Dec. is a long time ago. You should contact support.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:18:43
It only supports BTC.
I believe both coins can coexist and BTC and BCH fulfill different needs at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:01:29
Most of mining software is open source. Check on github, that should give you an idea.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:23:33
You should be looking at how to spam the blockchain without paying fees yourself.
