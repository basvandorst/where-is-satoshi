There's nothing extremely wrong with using the baht symbol for bitcoin - think of how many currencies use the dollar ($) sign. The problem lies with how mtgox is labeling their graphs. It could easily be solved by using the currency codes (i.e. BTC, and THB) instead of, or in addition to the sign.

I think you'll find that most people 'round here believe in Bitcoin as a currency and think that the value of it will rise in the long term. In the moderately distant future? Who knows. Will it reach the *abnormal* $30 highs we saw in June? I don't think it will until 2012 at the earliest. But that's just my piece of speculation, no one can tell for sure and only time will tell.

No one said they were running a ponzi. But AM dividends are likely to fall over the long term. They're great now because AM got into the game early, and friedcat is competent at running the company.
Everyday we see more developments in the ASIC world, competition is increasing. The supply of bitcoin cannot be increased so AM will be earning less as mining difficulty increases.
But wait, isn't AM planing to maintain a fixed proportion of the network (30% or something)? Yes, but it costs money to produce equipment - reducing profitability and dividends, more and more over time.
There's also the block reward halving, effects of which should be obvious.
But on the other hand, AM have been selling mining equipment which has been very fruitful for them and investors. If they can stay ahead of / keep up with tech advancements, they *might* be a great investment.


~3.5% ROI over a month. Reasonable in the bitcoin world, maybe.

Instead of letting the bill circulate, I think it('s keypair) should be destroyed after a single use.

I don't know if ASICs will reach "the masses". It's specialised hardware - requires more expertise and can't be re-purposed, most offerings to end user individual miners are potentially unprofitable, and can be hard to obtain - compared to video cards.

I think the cheapest way to perform a &gt;50% attack would be to take control of the network by force. The cost to abduct pool operators and *persuade* them to make a co-ordinated attack is a lot lower than fairly attacking with hashing power. If a few of the larger pool operators get together at the same place (a bitcoin conference?), the cost drops even more. Obviously, the more decentralised the network is the harder this type of attack would be.

It's similar to how card rooms use house players to ensure there's always action. They're not cheating in any way, just enticing other users to play. The only way it'd be fraud is if the winnings were skimmed by the operator (assuming they are SD sponsored bots) and not disclosed to shareholders of SD.
