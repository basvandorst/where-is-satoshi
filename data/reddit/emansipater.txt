Actually, since the Senate has no established public key digital signatures don't offer much in this situation.  Public announcement is actually cryptographically stronger.
Of course, I *do* think that government and other major bodies should have designated and carefully secured PGP keys...but until then press releases are pretty much what there is.

Yes, because a properly decentralised proof of stake protocol, unlike proof of work, will have the characteristic that "proof of work-like" costs (in the form of cost of capital plus penalties for an appropriately hedged supercapitalised attacker, and in the form of penalties for honest stakers under attack) emerge only when there is an attack (a.k.a. when the stake is at odds with itself), rather than existing 24/7 for the entire network whether or not anyone is attacking.  The main difference between capital as a resource compared with expended computation as a resource is that capital is much more liquid, so you can radically change the costs specifically when an attack is happening, even based on a subjective economic concept of "attack".  This is impractical for proof of work due to the friction of bringing new hashpower online (otherwise there would be something vaguely similar possible in a proof of work protocol, where normal difficulty would be very low and then spike rapidly if the network started being attacked).
**tl;dr** yes, and it's a pretty safe assumption.  Capital is a different thing than computation, and those differences enable different capabilities.

Would be very cool for government bodies to have cryptographic identities.  Right now they don't though, so a signature doesn't really mean anything (because the public key it would correspond to is not already established as theirs).

Proof of Work is the best system we currently have, but it's not magic.   I understand the basic motivation to warn people away from the pointlessness of proliferating altcoins that don't actually offer any new capabilities, but we don't have to "stack the deck" by insisting that Proof of Work can beat up any possible future system.  The reality is that even within a Proof of Work consensus system there is room for improvement (GHOST, etc.), and  a genuinely decentralized Proof of Stake algorithm would be a serious technical innovation, especially in its capability to offer a truly secure sidechaining mechanism which doesn't suffer from the pitfalls of merge-mining or the overhead of financing a separate proof-of-work economy.

This is a pretty naive analysis.  The reality is that miners will make more money by a)taking more fees when they can get them AND b)ensuring a healthy network leads to a better market value for bitcoins.  It's not at all obvious that the economic consequences of a) are stronger than the economic consequences of b), and in fact with current numbers b) is obviously a much larger factor.

For reference Paul, I and many others clearly understood what Vitalik was communicating--not a formal claim that a certain game theoretic condition holds here, but just that was saying the block halving point stands out against the background with a distinct differentiation (similar to the fashion in which a Schelling point stands out against a background of broad alternatives for otherwise fairly arbitrary reasons).  The general convention in English is that terminology becomes *more* useful if applied outside of its original context.
That said, if the Bitcoin community *were* in some bizarre position where we had to select a fork date without communication, I imagine that reasoning would probably go something like:
* early dates are too costly, so we wouldn't do it immediately
* exactly how far out would we do it?  once you get far enough out many dates are roughly equivalent in cost.  But switching at different times from each other involves enormous costs, so we have to try and coordinate somehow.
* hey, the block halving date is coming up.  Forking then has slightly different costs associated with it compared to other nearby dates, but those costs are still dwarfed by the costs of failing to coordinate
Result?  In an empirical test I actually think a nontrivial portion of people *would* choose the halving date just because it's so hard to coordinate otherwise.  Sounds like Schelling's work would actually be pretty applicable to that hypothetical situation.

First, let's fix your cooling misconception.  There are no devices that convert heat into electricity, only devices that convert a heat differential between a hot reservoir and a colder reservoir into electricity.  In so doing, they actually *interfere* with that heat flow, making the hot side stay hotter than it would if the heat were allowed to flow directly to the colder side without having to perform work in between.  Thermoelectric generators don't *help* with cooling.  From the chip's perspective, they *hurt* the cooling.  A maximally efficient heat sink is a better chip cooler than a maximally efficient thermoelectric generator.  The thermoelectric generator reduces the *net* amount of heat by the amount of electricity extracted, but it reduces this heat on the *cool* side of the equation, not the hot side.  If you instead had a device that made heat flow from the hot side to the cool side *faster* than it otherwise would in a heatsink, that would be called a "refrigerator", and it *consumes* electricity rather than produces it (plus, it also puts more heat out the back end than it takes in at the front, making the cool side pay a heat penalty as well).  Thermoelectric generation does *not* do away with cooling systems.  You just end up moving them to the other end of the thermoelectric generator to try and keep the cool side cool because it's the limiting factor in your efficiency anyways (see [Carnot's Theorem](
Second, let's fix your turbo misconception.  The turbo on a car works the exact way I described:  by impeding the flow of the exhaust gases, it actually makes the engine *less* efficient at producing forward motion.  When you then take this energy and use it to compress air for your fuel mixture, you are not getting a profit back out of the exhaust gases, you are getting a profit out of the improved fuel combustion that results from the higher temperatures and increased oxygen availability inside the combustion chamber.  It is only because the combustion is so *in*efficient to begin with that this loop "turns a profit" in terms of forward motion:  because it unlocks more previously wasted chemical energy than it destroys in thermodynamic inefficiency.  If you already had a maximally efficient chemical-energy-to-forward-motion converter, adding a turbo to it would make your car *slow down*.
Now in a miner, an ASIC is already the maximally efficient known machine for turning electricity into hashes, otherwise *that* machine would be the ASIC instead.  If you impede the cooling of the chip by attempting to extract work (the generation of electricity) from the heat differential between the hot chip and the comparatively cooler environment, you are similarly making the hash engine *less* efficient.  You can only hope to turn a profit if this harnessed energy can be used to improve the hash engine efficiency somehow, and by more than you've damaged it.  Unfortunately, as we've noted, the ASIC is *already* the most efficient known way of converting electricity into hashes, so there are no improvements available to spend your new electricity *on*.  And since the fact that you were running the ASIC at all tells me you value hashes more than electricity, even selling the electricity to any other use will still cost you more than you paid out to create it.  So either in hashes or dollars, this strategy won't turn you a profit.  The "turbo" is slowing down your "hash car".  (This analysis depends on the assumption that heat dissipation is a limiting factor in ASIC efficiency, which it definitely [is]( it wasn't, ASICs wouldn't be wasting electricity on mechanically turning fans to cool the chips.  If instead chips could get much hotter without tanking their efficiency, then adding thermoelectric generation wouldn't "stop up the workflow" very much as in my crappy metaphor.  In general, it's a pretty safe assumption that impeding heat flow in something with a heatsink will cost you more than it gives back, otherwise why did you build a heatsink?  The same principle would apply for bolting thermoelectric generators onto car radiators--you can be sure the thermoelectric generators will be going *elsewhere* in cars when they actually get there).

Quit parroting nonsense you heard from some troll.  Satoshi withdrew from public life around the time Wikileaks blew up [in December 2010](  One week later was the [last forum post on December 12](  Gavin didn't get contacted by In-Q-Tel until April 2011, and he was [extremely up-front about it](  His offhand comment about scaring Satoshi away by telling him about the speaking request was just classic Gavin humor.  Satoshi had already handed over commit access and the alert keys--the CIA conference invitation had nothing to do with Satoshi leaving.
@_date: 2015-09-05 06:20:34
Here's the problem--by extracting work from heat moving towards less hot destinations, you impede its flow (because physics).  That's fine if the heat wasn't part of something you're already extracting work from (as in the waste vehicle heat they suggest they can go after here).  In a miner, however, it's a bit of a different story.  There's very little "waste" heat--it's instead almost all the output of comparatively efficient computational operations.  If you "stop it up" by trying to harness the heat flow, you'll just introduce inefficiency at the chip level.  Even at ideal thermoelectric efficiencies, the amount of electricity you'd get out wouldn't be enough to do as much computation as you lost by interfering with the chip cooling to do it.  You'd make a net loss in work performed by introducing the thermoelectric generation layer.
You might be wondering why it matters if the heat is "waste" heat or not.  Well, for a crappy metaphor--if you're impeding the dissipation of heat for thermoelectric generation, then more of it is "piling up" at the input end.  But if that *input* end is the *output* end of another valuable process, you'll be "stopping up" that workflow by so doing, and reducing its effectiveness.  By comparison, if it wasn't actually a workflow you care about, then stopping it up won't cause any corresponding reduction in the main thing you were trying to do in the first place (and which was creating the heat).  So if you tried to harness the non-waste part of the ICE you would stop up the production of motion and slow the car down.  But if you harness a part that wasn't producing forward motion *anyways*, then stopping it up doesn't hurt your motion, and the gained energy is a strict bonus.  (Potentially easier to do in an ICE since it is so stupidly inefficient to start with compared to most ways you can use the electricity).
**tl;dr** no, you can't use this for miners.  It would only introduce additional inefficiencies.
@_date: 2015-09-06 04:06:36
In my simplified description, I'm using "waste" relative to "state of the art efficiency", not relative to thermodynamic limits.  Of course any nonsymmetric computer is producing *tons* of waste heat, impeded much further by current technological limitations in chip design.  But due to how highly competitive the ASIC industry is, ASICs are by definition the least wasteful known way of turning electricity into hashes.  See my comment above for a fuller explanation of why my crappy metaphor is appropriate.

Basically the attacker was completely unfamiliar with bitcoin and made no attempt to use multiple addresses.  So the same address was connected across multiple uses where one was the theft and one was the known identity.  It's like if I stole money from a bank where the serial numbers had been recorded, and then walked back into the same bank and tried to deposit it rather than dumping it on the black market somewhere.

As a professional "blockchain consultant" with many banks as clients, you are actually missing some aspects of blockchain technology that are technically groundbreaking.  The biggest one is the idea of cryptographically securing in real-time not just one portion of the business process but the coded definition of business process itself (basically rearranging your business process to meet the cryptographic needs instead of arranging your cryptography to meet your business process needs).  In blockchains, the cryptography is *authoritative* rather than just a channel for a part of your business process to be secured, and that is truly groundbreaking for an industry that normally views technology as an add-on to what must already be done.
Incidentally, the article linked is wrong about something--blockchains achieve consensus rather than truth, and time is far from the only way to generate an incentive for consensus.  Bitcoin is strictly equivalent at an algorithmic level to consecutive rounds of voting where PoW power is replaced by a weighting of votes in the same ratios, and voters incur a financial risk proportional to their weightings which they realise if consensus fails.  The reason PoW works better for pseudonymous online networks is that it gets rid of the difficult problem of deciding who gets which votes and vote weightings when you don't know who anyone is and have no other way to enforce risk realisation.  Bankchains make plenty of sense when you think about it this way--by simply knowing who each other are and signing legal agreements, the banks can very cheaply force a massive downside risk to consensus failure, creating the exact same incentivisation structure but with lower costs for participants when consensus is succeeding.  There's not that much difference between hacking a bank and hacking a mining pool--**both** rely on some method of "secrets" to control access to the voting power.  You think large mining operations don't ultimately rely on passwords to decide which chain they're mining on?  Proof of work isn't magic--just a mathematically easy way to measure resource commitment in open, pseudonymous networks.  If the proof of stake nut gets cracked, it will be by finding another way to do the exact same thing--enforce appropriate risk realisation in the event of consensus failure, while weighting vote power by the level of resources risked against success.  Its main promise is the same thing that bankchains are after--cheaper resource expenditure in the average case where consensus is working successfully.
@_date: 2015-10-12 23:50:02
It's not my system--I actually think open chains are better for the financial ecosystem, it's just my job to be fully aware of what the advantages and disadvantages are.  I will say that as long as whatever they adopt is sufficiently flexible, atomic cross-chain state transitions will give us something better than what we currently have.  But all that aside, no blockchain technology ensures honest participation, it only incentivises it.  There's nothing stopping miners as a group from randomly orphaning 30 block segments of the bitcoin blockchain in order to double spend against people--nothing except the fact that they're paid in bitcoin and acts such as those are unlikely to be positive for its valuation.  Both bankchains and bitcoin rely on the assumption that the majority is not trying to destroy the network, and treat all minority opinions as attacks.

"Central authorities" could be a lot of things, but I can assure you that for-profit financial institutions have *plenty* of incentives to live up to their contractual (and sometimes regulatory) obligations.  If you're trying to lay out fundamental differences between institution-sponsored and more generally decentralised networks, there are certainly plenty--for example the ease with which courts can mandate a hard forking state modification.  But these are not ultimately technological differences.  My main criticism of the linked article is simple:  there is actually value in bankchains from the bank's perspective, and the incentive structures they will leverage are not that terribly different from PoW.  The networks will naturally have very different social and political implications, but that's got nothing to do with PoW, and everything to do with how and whether the network's consensus participants decide to incorporate extra-technological considerations into their consensus votes.  Decentralised networks *are* different from centralised ones, but the linked article doesn't effectively articulate those differences.  Hint:  it's not PoW.

I think you're thinking at a slightly wrong layer of the model.  The bitcoin blockchain, for example, is often stored in traditional databases of various kinds by block explorers based on their lookup needs.  In my mind the blockchain is a cryptographic characteristic of data which will certainly be stored in regular old federated databases by most larger institutions (for both private and public blockchains).  Blockchain technology is more a matter of giving their existing datastores "blockchainness" than it is of replacing an entire data architecture (though clearly there is much work to do before this can actually happen).

If the network doesn't like the proposed PoS algorithm, they just change two or three lines of code and stay on PoW.  The only thing that the "difficulty bomb" in ethereum does is force the community to do a hard fork at some point.

I'm not going to get into a "True Scotsman" discussion about what makes something a real blockchain, but since I work in an advisory capacity and not with any vendor or platform builder (nor do I hold stock in any company producing such a solution) I can say quite conclusively that I'm not selling anything.  My clients come to me and ask me what the advantages and disadvantages of private blockchains are, and I tell them both very frankly.  A simple example:  if you're not using literally the same code as public and widely deployed blockchains, you can't expect to benefit from their real-world levels of battle-hardening.  And if *are* using literally the same code, but just caching the generated blocks and their contents in traditional databases to do API-style lookups, then honestly it still sounds pretty "blockchainy" to me.

If you have to produce PoW anyways, there are plenty of benefits to be drawn from it (I'd add stress-testing of the underlying primitive, stronger guarantees of timelike ordering to observers who don't trust any voters, performance improvements in header verification, and reliance on a strictly smaller set of cryptographic primitives, amongst others).
That being said, if you have another way to produce the same consensus results you have to now do a more even-handed cost-benefit analysis than was necessary when PoW was required just to make the system possible.
If I were to tackle the feature you pointed out and work back from it, instead of working forward from PoW to note a benefit, I would quickly find that key-based voting can provide a much stronger anti-reversal cost (by simply cycling to new keys on a daily or weekly schedule and deleting the old ones) at a significantly lower cost than the "&gt;1 dollar spent per 1 dollar of attacker cost created" model which you note.  Deleting a key is nearly free, and for the attacker to compute a private key from the public keys and signatures (all that now remains) is a much *higher* computational cost than any PoW system ever proposed.
There's nothing stopping voters from *adding* PoW requirements to their votes.  Nothing except the incredibly poor cost benefit ratio.  For public blockchains, we don't even have to do that analysis because we have no truly distributed alternatives to PoW.  But if a truly decentralised Proof of Stake system comes on the market, we'll have to start asking ourselves the same tough question, and asking it without the presumption of knowing the answer is "we should hold to the status quo".
*(I also have to point out that "hash rate" based analyses don't reflect most real life attack scenarios.  A far more realistic metric is "attack cost" which gets you away from thinking "how long do I have to run my equipment" and to the much more useful question "how much does this cost to do overnight when I do it at scale by any means possible".  Under this form of analysis the deceptive 2x factor bitfury mentions tends to pretty much disappear, and you realise that it's actually cheaper to reverse old blocks than it was to create them)*

All electronic devices are 100% efficient at converting electricity to heat, because all electricity ends up as heat no matter how you use it--that's just basic thermodynamics.  You could literally replace any electric space heater with an equivalent wattage in Bitcoin ASICs and get the identical heat output, with the mining as a bonus.
It's not even an especially radical idea--many office buildings in temperate zones are designed to be heated entirely by the waste heat from their computers in winter time.  Replacing electric heaters with ASICs in buildings which don't have many computers is a pretty natural next step.  If Bitcoin is still at the present valuation or higher in 10 years this isn't just a possible scenario--it's a likely one.

Many people participating in project m-day are doing it for free--I just wanted to make it worth the time for some of the people who will put a lot of work in on these designs by offering some of my own cash.  Not a scam.

Basically, yes.  one cBTC is already more than a U.S. dollar, which means switching now wouldn't give us any further breathing room.

The existence of well-traded options for a market is generally thought to smooth volatility in price and at the very least provides hedging opportunities for people who must hold, borrow, or loan large amounts of bitcoins.
For example, a miner knows about how many bitcoins they will earn over the next few weeks, but has real world expenses to pay and these will exceed the income if the price drops too far.  By purchasing a binary option they can ensure that either way they will have enough cash to pay their bills.
**tl;dr:** It's good.

This is a repost since the first one suffered from a misleading title.  I am NOT trying to get free work from media professionals here--this about community members who want to help out a non-profit project being rewarded in the way Bitcoin does best.

For those unfamiliar with the term, a binary option is essentially a yes/no bet on what the price will be at a certain time.

Yes, items costing thousands of dollars can still be priced in BTC for that luxury feel.  Still, even 10k mBTC doesn't feel that weird to say.

The day isn't to define people's preferences.  It's to create a conversation on the two year anniversary of the mbit passing the U.S. cent, and to use a central theme to help spread awareness of the unit so people won't be surprised when they see it around.

Once you buy a casascius physical coin or bar, you can simply deposit more into it--it probably makes it less resaleable since it makes the face value different from the actual value, but for storage it works perfectly (and indeed many people are using it for this).

Just a tip on anyone planning to store data in the blockchain--your transaction **must** be in the tx0 set, because anything else will likely be pruned at some point in the future as a size-reduction method in the blockchain (up until now we lacked the math to do this, but Eli Ben-Sasson has come up with a secure way, and it's only a matter of time).
And another tip:

Some people prefer "XBT" as a currency code over "BTC" since it fits the ISO standard for extra-national currencies.  If Bitcoin achieves widespread adoption, 'XBT' will probably be the official unit by which banks etc. refer to it (BTC as bitcoins will never be an ISO standard).  Hence, mXBT.

Nope, it's a traditional financial institution and is looking for as much info as any other (maybe more since they sell leveraged products where you can lose more money than you deposit).  You'll also want to check your jurisdiction to see what the tax and legal implications of trading are before signing up.

Most people in the thread seem pretty clear on what's going on, and how on earth can it be *worse* that I am giving my own money to someone whose work I appreciate and someone whose work the community appreciates?

Your timings are a little bit off--for example, Satoshi was long gone before Gavin was invited to speak by "the CIA" (technically *at* the CIA by their semi-independent spinoff [In-Q-Tel](  Gavin's invite was also very post major media coverage--geeks in the appropriate departments certainly knew enough about Bitcoin to decide it was worth inviting him in the first place.  Quote from the *Washington Post*:

So far the options they are offering are for more than a month out, making it more difficult to profit off of a short term manipulation with the markets.

**Currently Bitcoin as a system probably uses less energy than other payment systems** because of all the additional things involved in running a credit card or banking system, such as employees driving to work and lights on in offices where people are making fraud assessments, marketing their company's services, etc.
However, **on a per payment basis it gets a little more complicated**.  Bitcoin is still early in its "issuance" phase (only about half of all Bitcoins are in circulation so far) and for a variety of technical reasons current electricity usage is proportional to the exchange rate instead of the transaction volume.  Because of the recent rise in price, this means that a lot of energy is being used per transaction--probably more than in any other payment system.  *Additional* transactions have almost no effect on the overall energy consumption, which basically means that ***using* bitcoins is extremely energy efficient, while simply *buying* a bunch of them is energy *in*efficient.**  Confused yet?
Well fear not, because in the long run Bitcoin will almost certainly become the most energy efficient payment system the world has ever seen.  That's because in addition to the fact that many more transactions can be added to Bitcoin without a significant increase in electrical consumption, Bitcoin's most energy-intensive component (mining) can be moved anywhere in the world that there is an internet connection.  Why does this help?  Well, there are many places where electricity is going to waste, such as at generating stations running under capacity, or in solar arrays on an especially sunny day.  Bitcoin miners are also perfectly efficient electric heaters, and we're already starting to see Bitcoin mining used in cold places where they need to convert electricity to heat anyways (meaning the mining takes no additional energy whatsoever).  As competition naturally pushes these locations to take over a bigger share of Bitcoin mining, **the most energy intensive part of Bitcoin reduces to a net impact of almost zero!**  Combining this with the fact that Bitcoin needs very few human beings involved to make it work, Bitcoin would easily be orders of magnitude more efficient than any existing payment system--digital *or* physical.
**TL;DR:**  Buying bitcoins currently burns a lot of energy; using bitcoins burns next to none; and if it continues to be successful Bitcoin will eventually lower its energy footprint to near zero.

Wow.  Just wow.  FYI, almost all Bitcoin-related graphical work has been unpaid.  People like me who put their own money toward *non-profit community projects* that would otherwise be entirely unfunded are not exactly coming out of the woodwork, and with responses like this it's no surprise.  When you start spending your *own* money to grow the Bitcoin community, you can call me whatever you want.  Until then, do your homework before you get in the way of something valuable.

Alright, would it be fair to say that the language made it appear I was looking for career media professionals?  I can understand how that would look.

If you are implementing accounting software, I agree.  In all other cases, uBTC is entirely unusable at present because of its small value.  By contrast, a hamburger costs 20 mBits and a can of pop costs 2 mBits, so they are right in the psychological sweet spot.

The tx0 set are the non-used-up transactions in the block chain that could be spent at any time (as opposed to spent transactions which don't represent any unspent value).  Essentially this means that some bitcoins *must* be "lost" or permanently sitting there without having been spent.
An alternative if you're not using the blockchain for *storage* (only *proof*) would be to keep a copy of the transaction (and merkle tree) yourself, although this might require additional work depending on the proof method used to trim the blockchain (such as a chained proof that has to be updated every time the blockchain is trimmed).

Non-anarchist here who has worked my butt off since 2010 to grow the Bitcoin community.  Bitcoin was **not** created by market anarchists.  Market anarchists did participate, and deserve their fair recognition, but there have been plenty of other people working hard on Bitcoin from the beginning--Mike Hearn is a classic example.  The Bitcoin-anarchy association has as much to do with squeaky wheel syndrome as anything else; most of us don't advertise our politics as part of our participation.

With 1 mBTC and a ticker to 3 decimal places, the value looks all decimally and unfriendly.  Does anyone know of an easy way to embed something I would have a little more control over?  I'd love to embed something that was just "12.1 cents" or something more human friendly like that.

Agreed.  But just as a pet peeve with mrniceguy119--why on earth do you think you have to buy a whole 1000 mBTC?  You could easily buy 500 or 250 instead!
But don't.  Buy him something he wants.  And buy him some small amount of mBTC secretly so that he won't be disappointed if Bitcoin skyrockets--just don't tell him about it unless he comes around to the idea on his own.  I did that with $50 worth of bitcoins for my parents two and a half years ago, and someday soon they're going to have a nice surprise.
