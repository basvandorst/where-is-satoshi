We must be sure to blame any victims that show up.

Strange since they threaten to cancel your google wallet if you associate any transactions with Bitcoin

Right, or maybe let them use their invoice number to retrieve the address from my website?  Which can have room for lots more information about BTC on that webpage.

While I'm not surprised they would want to kill bitcoin, and try to kill bitcoin.  
Why will bitcoin fail, when something like bittorrent lives on?
I know I have a future optimism bias, but when it comes to technology, there seem to be far more numerous and more clever people developing, than there are government legislators restricting.
If bitcoin dies.  Will not there be 5 new solutions seeking to fill the gap?
Not to belittle the struggle of bitcoin, or invalidate how frustrating it must be to lose a battle.
I have some hope left.

They don't need to understand bitcoin themselves to be able to throw three questions at him at once.  Each one posed as a threatening "fear" and then talk over his answer after three words.  Why put all the work into understanding it. That's not their job.

I'm under the impression that there is a limit of 0.00000001 btc.  Has that changed?
