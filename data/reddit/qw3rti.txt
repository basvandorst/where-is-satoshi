Yeah, you're going to the bottom here.

But will we move to deploying a UASF if SegWit doesn't reach the activation threshold? I guess what I'm curious about is where this ends up. At what point will core stand behind a contentious hard/softfork, because it is the only other way to implement a code change across the network? 
The only way to progress past a point of no consensus is to split. It seems rather obvious, but I feel everyone is trying especially hard to ignore it. It makes little sense for Jihan and the other miners to give into Segwit, but of course they can only agree to be dragged along. I believe many of the developing parties have realised this, hence the date shift.

I'd still like to know how everyone is confidently measuring this.  
Could someone also explain to me why UASF isn't in essence the contentious hardfork everyone has been down-talking for so long? Have we all informally come to agreement that the only way forward is to split the network contentiously? 
I think I just don't properly understand UASFs, which may be an issue considering I'm an everyday user.

ELI5 UASF?

Any downsides to a UASF? I'm also not very familiar with the current signalling/activation process, but would like to know why that pathway was taken first, rather than going straight to 'user activation'. I'm assuming it's just cleaner and there are less compatibility problems with actual transactions, both validation and mining.

If there are 2000 tx/second taking place over Lightning, imagine the price of Bitcoin. Now times that by 12.5 coins every 10 minutes. Now add the hundreds of thousands of channels that need to be opened with regular Bitcoin transactions each year. There you go.
edit: currently there are 3-5 bitcoin worth of tx fees in each block. Thus, provided that Bitcoin appreciates roughly more than 33% in value before the next halving, tx fees at 0 (which isn't going to happen anytime ever), would still be fine.

Until Lightning Network is up and running, and merchants accepting cryptocurrencies is common-place, there is nothing wrong with using fiat for small payments. Keep what you need to spend in fiat, and the bulk of your wealth/savings in Bitcoin. This is Bitcoin's primary use-case, a store of wealth that is far easier to handle and more useful than precious metals. This is quite easy to achieve if you have access to an exchange that offers Bitcoin credit/debit cards.

It's halved in value relative to Bitcoin. 0.15 --&gt; 0.08.

So miner's are going to force a POW change and invalidate hundreds of millions of dollars worth of mining equipment, or...
Just follow what user's want and keep their jobs. 
Not even Silbert can make that argument. This period is saving face.

This is an excellent initiative to demonstrate the power of the internet of money. If you're up x,xxx% on bitcoin, please consider donating a small amount of your profit to this cause. Think of the genesis block coinbase text.
