Mutual betting perfectly reflects what are the real odds. You can see now that this is 50% for yes and 50% for no. I will bet for "no". I'm kind of pessimist. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:47:53
That's true 
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:22:47
That's my tactic :D 
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:21:10

I live in Europe (Latvia). To be honest people here are scared as shit. When they hear "Trump" they think - war with Russia. What do you think un U.S about it? Trump is a perfect match for Russia. I think that it could be a end of NATO. ... Open to discuss!
