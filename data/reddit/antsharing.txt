Who trades fruequntly with his life savings?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:30:29
“you loose” Most people will still have profit. But just not at much anymore. Talking about older investors (2 months)
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:28:07
Dont worry, you will probably be laughing at the people who are selling now.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:03:54
Doesnt it run out after like 50$? and then it needs to be refilled with cash but no items have been sold. Doesnt that raise questions?
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:30:25
We are working on that, hold thight
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:55:23
yes but 2 a correction is scary but not so much if your still in the green. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:24:17
Well as long if no one tells me to. I wont pay taxes I guess. Once I turn 18 I will start declaring that I own bitcoin. Other than that no tax for me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:49:46
Im sorry that happened to you, I will get rid of it just send it my way
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:31:44
it has a real chance it will
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:59:52
Sending from one does
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:37:54
What about now? are they happy?

How huge was your student debt if you dont mind me asking
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:54:21
15 million*
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:51:00
nice, I found nothing in my old wallets since I dont have any
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:07:25
It a physical wallet that holds your coins on it. The main advantage is that your coin cant be stolen. Since the hardware wallet never displays your private key to a computer.
You can google it btw. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:16:14
Its more like a dream we all have
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:10:32
Agreed if you spent that insane amounts of money you better get a high paying job otherwise why would you spend so much on studies. Well I guess everything in the us is exspensive. Glad I live in the netherlands where education is a low price
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:05:55
"You can safely plug them into less than trustworthy computer. But you do need to set it up on trustworthy computer once." 
False, the private key never leaves your ledger so it is still save.

Whats the point of this post? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:54:21
Because I was loosing more money by holding in my back acount. Than I was gaining from intrest
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:30:11
You can ask your self if that is a bitcoin problem or a problem where you live. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:10:28
Yeah ofcourse, I thought that was clear. Almost nothing with bitcoin has changed since price went from 300 till 14000. Its all speculation in the hope someone else will buy these coins for more. And you buy them now in the hope one day bitcoin will be come mainstream and the will be fundementals backing it up.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:49:56
Even if we are in a bubble most of us have 100% to 300% return of investment. Sell the amount you invested and your safe. Dont get greedy
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:56:32
exchange rates?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:06:35
Well I dont live live in the use and also if I just keep my bitcoin I dont have to pay taxes on them. Untill I cash out I guess. 
I honestly dont know much about taxes since im 17 so never had to do anything with them yet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:30:06
I dont have a spare 17k sitting around
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:03:26
I will sell  a coin
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:42:58
Why does my ledger say so then? Did you ever use segwit to send bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:33:36
No if I declare it on my taxe I will be fine
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:43:51
At least I am open to the fact bitcoin cash might one day will take over. 
You on the otherhand, you dont see it as a possibilty that bitcoin cash will die off. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:16:43
By placing your bitcoins on a segwit wallet, I use ledger but there are oter non hardware wallet who support segwit google them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:25:59
Done, now what?
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:45:40
"...for $1.50" with a segwit wallet
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:58:04
Yeah okay thats true, fees are fcked up.
Hope lightning comes and will be used in a year of 2
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:27:22
ahh okay, I hope I can pay my education with butcoin. As of now it seems like it. That would mean I would even get debt :D
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:27:38
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:51:07
Yeah my numbers were a bit off. I was just trying to say 5$ is nothing to 35$ its a huge difference
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:55:40
3 were already sold
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:19:42
Yeah just a bit above 5$ to get in within a hour
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:57:40
Yes ofcourse I agree it should be 0.0001$ as a fee. But my point is people keep saying fees are super high (35$) but they are not if you use segwit. People seem to mis the fact that you can just use segwit and pay 20x less in fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:50:19
If you pay a high enough fee wont you just be included 100% in the next block?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:55:28
no its dead
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:24:32
Wow you actually have the video, thanks! 
It broke thru the wall with out any resistance 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:14:10
I dont say this often, but here it goes.
Your a total fucking idiot. "Zombies/parrots" you are out if you mind. I DO own bitcoin cash and NEVER sold it. 
You think your some kind of smart ass dont you? Get a life
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:23:48
You wont have to pay tax, its just that when you made a lot f money they know it was of bitcoin not from shady businuss.
No need to call me a moron
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:25:20
Never to late to try again
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:53:04
Ofcourse you can :) It would be fun to gove him a paper wallet. So something you can actually give as a present.
But be sure to hold a copy in case he loses it. 
 website for paperwallets
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:00:30
Personally I am waiting for a bigger "bubble" to form. That would be at 60k-150k$
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:22:20
No since then it wouldnt been safe
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:33:42
Tes you can it costs like 1.50$ or if you want to wait longer it will cost you 0.40$ 
USE SEGWIT ugh
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:27:04
I do, But I dont pay taxes
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:01:44
I would wait for a dip
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:13:01
Well maybe in the US it is. Where I live it like 15-20k on average
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:01:48
Here it used to be free, now it is 2000€ a year
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:22:13
Is this something you really care about? what should we change in your opinion
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:32:19
My own ledger hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:49:46
Wait are you sarcastic? sorry I dont get what you are trying to say...
I mean it is only 1.50$ in fees wich is low when looking at other people who say like 35$ in fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:45:49
Or you just pay a low fee and wait untill this bullrun is over. I never payed more then 30 cents for a bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:28:33
do you live in the same country as me? Do you know how taxes work here? I dont even have to declare how much bitcoin I have. Just that I have it
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:08:33
Fomo, lightning network update and upcoming features
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:54:59
Oh yeah is wasnt exactly 1.50$ more like 2-5$ depending on how fast you want it to confirm. 
It was more to prove my point a 3$ fee is much lower then an 30$ one some people are talking about
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:30:05
At 2500$ people were saying the exact same thing. "We have just hit 3000$, this is insane when will it go wrong" Also back then people were syaing "my uber deiver talked about bitcoin, so are we in a bubble"
Now at 19.000$ people like you say the exact same thing.
And at 35.000$ people will too.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:28:14
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:02:31
Or you can just go back to your own sub.
You can also jst use litecoin, ethereum or any other coin. Your Bcash isnt unique its just a stupid copy altcoin
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:53:41
We are addicted to price rises
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:17:14
I own 0.000001 bitcoin  
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:25:22
Yeah but that is your starting sallery I suppose. Also 60k is not to bad for a beginner.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:55:25
Good thing im still underaged so dont have to pay capital tax��
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:38:41
Bitcoin is just blowing up right now, Give it a few months/years and we will figure something out. Just dont expect there is a solluition we can implement by tommorow.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:55:44
how do you even have 125k debt from college?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:55:19
What about the new release of the lightning network. And there has never been solid reasons for bitcoin to grow this much. It just does
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:54:37
fomo, futures and lightning network
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:14:56
Be happy, We already made a shit ton of money. At least if you just hold your coins. 
A few weeks ago there were periods were bitcoin wasnt going up for dats sometimes even weeks
Since this recent price surge people have become greedy
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:59:18
Did you use  and generate them on a offline computer? If so, some one got a hold of your phsyical wallet
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:25:54
Well the spread is about 1000$ between bitfinex and gdax
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:12:31
Ah okay, well they are only displayed on the device it self. That the whole point of a hardware wallet :p
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:14:04
No, no one told me. I use segwit myself and pay 2$ for an hour wait time.
And 35$ is almost 20x as much as that
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:21:50
Yeah huge difference, still to high though
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:47:50
Koreans are like the most of us but somehow they always have extreme FOMO imo wich results in intensive buying
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:59:15
5$ if you want it faster, still not 35$
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:20:13
 We have different opinions. I respect your opinion but believe in something else. I believe in "segwitcoin" and you believe in bitcoin cash, so be it.
"redditor for 4 weeks" lol you must be a real economic mastermind btw phaha

Haha I wasnt being serious. That the smart thing to do when soending bitcoin buy the bitcoin back
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:39:09
Maybe or maybe not. No one knows what price will do. And everyone saying they do are lying
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:46:27
wow good for him someone send that much to him
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:24:22
I made a lot more then that. But how do you expect me to do taxes? I never learned that or did anyone ever tell me. I dont even know where and how to do it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:48:26
Please dont trust people "helping" you to much. Some people want to rob you. Also I suggest to create a new topic on for this. Or google simiulair story's.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:05:37
"shitcoins" you mean ethereum and litecoin are shitcoins? makes you go nuts I guess. its like a big cult

where to watch the replay?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:32:40
Yeah same for me. Knowing my self I will probably find a way to fuck it up and in the end actually loose money.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:57:23
a whale
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:51:42
Also been here since June. My advice is to forget about the amount of bitcoin you have. Just keep buying some. Right now your feeling fomo. But when bitcoin goes down again at somepoint you will feel releafed
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:45:58
1.50$ fee with segwit atm
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:56:04
The lambo price ticker needs to go down then. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:22:22
I make like 300$ a month at my job��
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:18:53
Use segwut and use a lower fee
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:01:12
Otherwise you will eat your left ball roght?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:10:36
true that
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:45:03
Ever heared of segwit? it wil be 1.50$ in fees
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:16:57
Yeah he will crash the market down to 1500 before all his coins will be bought back. And price will be normal again.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:09:42
I own bitcoin cash as much as I have bitcoin. Btw I bought it at 250$ 
Ofcourse I do not hope bitcoin cash overtakes. And I believe it wont. 
Im not fearfull at all. You are just brainwashed because your on r/bt.c  all the time
Hope you get banned from this aub ugf
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:34:56
You mean 1.50$ if you freaking use segwit
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:37:05
Wow that sucks. Im glad the goverment here pays 2/3 of our costs when going to school. It even used to be free
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:59:33
thanks! for doing this
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:12:19
With out sarcasm you sound you know what you are talking about. Do your thing, Im just in btc for the long run and dont really care what markets are doing rightnow. Either I loose all my money (idc) or make a lot of money. I will be a happy person anyway :)
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:10:20
Is this satire?
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:52:49
No, No and No. Bitcoin is the main chain but still that is also risky to invest in just like as in altcoins. Some of them have great visions and growth potential. They may be very big players in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:18:24
or get a paper wallet yeah
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:25:29
yeah im glad I dont life in the us haha
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:32:55
Couldnt you find a bitcoin sticker? I found one yesterday for 0.83$ dont know how big it is tho
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:35:18
lol I have my btc stored at my aunts house
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:47:52
Dont take my advice but I think there will be a fall back in price just like the 5 other times we saw a growth like this. I think a fallback of 20-30% but this could be more or less.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:39:40
Ahh yeah, didnt think of that. Locally it would be very hard I guess
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:04:13
didnt you got a back-up phrase?
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:40:14
I reccon Bittrex. It is the current biggest with almost 0 problems.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:02:49
Yep, one single hack and all your data is out on the internet. Never ever send a Copy of your ID online. Here in the netherlands it is even illegal to do so I thought.
Just search for a site wich doesnt need copy of id
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:53:18
Noo im only 17 and invested a small amount om money to turn into profita maybe in 5 years. If I loose it all I would mind since the possible rewards were worth it
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:11:24
Yes, I saw that post that guy just pumped some coins that he didnt know shit about. I have read enough about the coins I invested in and believe in most of them. 
The 600 to 200btc also happened because he invested in the wrong coins at the wrong time. Just because bitcoin went up just now doesnt mean that that would be the only good investment. If bitcoin came crashing down you will be sad how you didnt invest in altcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:04:16
My tip is use coin that are low in price to trade with.
on poloniex/bittrex when withdrawing 
You pay 1.50/3$ in fees on eth/btc. Because those take 0.001 from you coins (or something like that)
When withdrawing coins like EMC2 (worth 0.04$ per token) the fee is still 0.001 so that about 1/10 of a cent per transaction.
Also you can use to transfer litecoin(0,08$) to transfer funds cheaply
TL:DR avoid coins worth alot when trading
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:13:56
Lol no, That would mean I won't have any money left. Als I have already 1500$ invested (mostly in alt-coins but also btc).
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:18:58
This logo wont last ;)
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:39:03
Lol until a dip comes and your moms panics sells xd
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:06:45
I couldnt handle the stress anymore. Just cashed out. I took my money since I need it now. Some unexspected things also happened in my life. Just needed the money....
Maybe will buy in later, when I have money available.
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:50:57
yeah just hold an equal amount of bch that you have in btc
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:10:29
Yeah I own both, but still im worried about my alt coins in something happens to btc
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:31:11
No indeed you wont "lose" money, but you will mis out on a growth and then buying back at a higher price. if the coin the goes down a bit then you loose.
Well good for you that you bought at 1850$ but still im just saying be carefull
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:53:11
Im expecting much earlier tbh. My guess based on pure guessing haha. Is that it will go to 4200/4300 and then drop to 3400/3600
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:40:33
Yeah thats my problem, there wont be a wallet out there who supports all my coin also I will have to order a probably 100$ harddrive/wallet. To store them on. I also face the risk of losing/destroying/getting hard drive stollen.
So I trust my money at Bittrex, It might not be the smartest option but still there such a big company I just hope they never scam all there people.
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:08:58
Thats just dumb really. I guess most people at that time just didnt care about 4 btc (10 dollars) but if you really believed in btc you should never loose your wallet
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:54:34
You had a valid point. Just bought another 0.15btc on top of the 0.10 btc I had 
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:54:47
lol haha
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:59:44
But there will be a correction at some point. Maybe a correction from 5k to 4k who knows
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:18:03
My advice is just buy a hardware wallet. I bought mine today. It just gives you alot security and can store it in a very secure place and not have to worry ever again
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:02:55
you dont get it do you? 
You are acting like, "why doesnt everyone just sell at the top and buy at the dip"
Since you cant predict 100% what prices will do. 
If you sold at 4400$ and it went to 5000$ then what?
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:53:10
Yeah true that, I also probably wouldn't have noticed bitcoin in 2011 since it wasnt popular.
I am willing to take risks but still crypto's are at a  VERY high risk level. It can easily gain 25% in a day or loose that amount.
Thats why I like it. But still if crypto's really blows up I still will get a nice amount of money for what I did when I was 17. 
I think only less then 0,00001% of 17-year olds have more than 1k invested.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:27:34
I still believe in crypto's but needed the money right now. And cant afford to loose any atm. Because something happened
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:18:39
I pretty much stole 300upvotes from you haha
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:11:59
Yes, I saw that post that guy just pumped some coins that he didnt know shit about. I have read enough about the coins I invested in and believe in most of them. 
The 600 to 200btc also happened because he invested in the wrong coins at the wrong time. Just because bitcoin went up just now doesnt mean that that would be the only good investment. If bitcoin came crashing down you will be sad how you didnt invest in altcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:41:50
Yes ofcourse it will crash but just hold. And at some point it will rise hopefully
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:21:49
zal ik doen
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:29:24
Yes I know the risk but your just hating on altcoins because you have all your money in bitcoin and none in altcoins. I also have 400$ in btc that still a good amount I think.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:29:39
Lol why not you have bad friends if you consider they would steal your coins
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:05:54
OP trying to make a quick buck here lol
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:49:18
Thats what we thought when we reached 3000$
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:54:08
I wont start paying bitcoin if the transaction cost is above 5 cents. Transfering money from my bank costs 0$.
Whyv should I pay in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-11 01:56:57
Lol I could buy 2 whole coins right now and im just 17. I think the number shpuld be bigger then 0,01% haha
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:24:22
yeah why are you only investing 36$, If you want to start in crypto you have to ether put some money in every week/month or just put more than 100$ and leave it. 
But cmon man 36$?
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:27:10
I have my bitcoin in a website wallet that uses bip39. 
Why do people dont like to keep your money on exchanges, I dont get that. I have over 20 alt coins. Am I suposed to open 20 different wallets and have like a piece of paper with 20 private keys? Or what should I do with out it taking a awful lot of work or money
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:20:28
It looks like youre just here for the money. Try reading about blockchain it gives you trust and makes you feel more relexed
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:23:00
Well not really since lottery is gambling. You have 99% not to double your money.
Bitcoins is investing, The odds are mich greater
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:15:51
Im just hodling because I believe in blockchains. It will either make it or brake it. When it makes it I will sell a part of it. But I will not be selling untill blockchains become mainstream and the big money starts rolling in
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:32:47
lol, where do you life?
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:46:04
never say never !RemindMe 212 days
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:55:11
Hahah that would be so funny in 5 tears time. You will remeber it as the you paid 2k for a stupid game phaha
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:23:34
Same here my btc arent up for sale
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:11:48
Also I think 88€ isnt that big of a investment if you look at what security you will get. On top of that I own a lot of altcoins and currently store them on a exchange. Wich is a dumb thing to do. So I want to put them on my ledger.
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:18:34
Very good article! I also bought a ledger only downsides my funds not safe untill end of this month. Because ledger doesnt ship earlier
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:18:42
and how to load the page with out internet?
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:24:19
Well I will get richer then most of the people since 99,5% have 0btc if not even more.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:46:01
What does fomo mean? I have heared it alot but really dont know
Yeah I hope so. Right now im just a bit worried about my btc. No worrys I will always hodl
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:07:01
I dont expect a drop really
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:56:23
Yeah was also thinking what happens if we have another 2009-crisis will crypto surge to be a very big thing or does the market tumble
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:19:13
Yeah thats why I will buy the new bitcoins if they come out. Im will buy as much as a i own bitcoin in mBtc value so 0.1 btc means 0.1 bch.
But I have FOMO in altcoins so I wont sell them. I will just hodl for 5 years and see what has happened by then
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:02:05
wanna hear my investments? (wich alt coins)
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:22:55
Some people like that idea. But personaliy I just like the 0.05btc/0.003btc. Since I am finally used to the way it gives info about the value
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:09:19
I dont know, unless your dutch
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:23:00
Pfff indeed people talking about old man sacks if they are the holy ones who know what bitcoin will do
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:30:45
Uhm how is that possible? When I tried to put a really exspensive buy order it said something like: "You can't list buy orders higher/lower than 10%"
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:12:30
luv u too
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:55:42
I have a total of 2000$ in coins and if the value goes up. Lets say to 2500$+ I will buy a ledger an put most of my funds on there
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:19:20
You should never tell people to biy bitcoin. You can advise them to lock into Bitcoin/blockchains and maybe consider investing in it.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:15:01
Correct me if im wrong but blockchain is the power behind bitcoin. Its the system of not having banks/goverment involved in transactions. Bcause every person holds a copy of the transaction historty it self.
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:37:11
I have never used Kraken. I use Bittrex and so do the most people fees on there are very low when trading imo (only 0.15% fees)
So that 0.15 cents of you buy 100$ in eth with btc
Dont take my word investigate yourself. Im not to sure about what I just said.
Yeah just read some whitepapers about altcoins and invest in what you believe will be a good coin in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:19:43
Thats true I also use Breadwallet atm. But I mostly afraid of loosing my altcoins in exchanges 
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:55:41
Ah okay, Thats a nice amount to make every day. To bad I cant mine (to poor / live with parents (dont allow me to let my computer run all the time)).
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:08:54
400$ in Bitcoin
240$ in eth
160$ in stratis
150$ in waves
120$ in komodo
120$ in Lisk
70$ in Golem
60$ in LBRY credit
60$ in Metal
50$ in Steem
50$ in Neo
50$ in Litecoin
40$ in IOTA
35$ in Ripple
30$ in Nem
+ maybe 10 other coins
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:34:19
nah it nothing that bad. No health problems. Just some money problems I have to fix. Nothing special :p
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:55:41
Yes I will always hold my btc. Just as I will hold my bch.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:40:12
ow you just read about it probably, I was also planning on buying some altcoins at that time but was to late . Still bought 300$ off altcoins before the big price raise. Now it 505$ not much but still
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:09:08
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:41:42
Nothing. Since I could affort to loose the money untill now. Thats why I cashed out.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:36:12
Yeah I get that, but Im still poor and every penny counts��
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:26:37
I have done that for 3 reasons
1. More "growth" potential. Alt coins have a smaller market cap so more money can be put in to them fastily increasing them in value. Where a lot more money is needed to 5x btc. (For example look at neo this week)
2. You don't know what is going to be the big coin of the future it might be a different coin. 
3. If bitcoin grows so do the altcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:26:16
Ahhh yeah I see. Sorry it looked like I was mad sorry. I just want to gove more info ;) 
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:42:06
When I was new to crypto I was also sad when I lost money but after the dip before aug 1 I learned in the end everything becomes okay again went from -50% to +10% just imagine If I panicked and sold. I would still be in the red.
3 weeks ago I was still in the red(-20%) and was hoping to be at no loss at the end of the year. Now im already up. Crypto is a realy fast market where you can earn (or loose) if you just stay calm.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:18:35
Yeah but if you make purchases you will regret later when the price rises haha
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:48:13
Not that much
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:11:10
Miners are only thinking about money, not what is the best for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:25:43
they are most likely sold at a very low price
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:15:35
Yes I think it will. I am just worried atm that I will loose al my btc to a stupid mistake I make. Or that I will get hacked idk. Reddit has made me paranoid of loosing my momey. And 2500$ maybe not so much for a ledger but if the prices rise then you will get more and more money in a save place
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:52:59
You have a point there but this is cryptoland everything can happen
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:24:06
Just dont panic sell thats all
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:07:31
Just tell them not be afraid and just like a normal healty investment it cant just keep growing 10% a day
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:48:47
No one can tell, well with this growth it could be 10k plus. But I think there will be another dip and a recovery to 6/9k$
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:12:52
Yeah I sometimes forget how spoiled I actually am.
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:32:39
thanks for the info
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:16:57
yeah just dont use gdax
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:57:57
Put the reminder on 20 days haha. No to be honest I dont know with this growth rate we will hit 5k by the end of next week
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:19:13
Niet? dat lijkt me raar. Maar heb je je bitcoins nog steeds niet?
Ik zou als eerst contact opnemen met btcdirect en vragen naar je transactie id
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:17:46
buy 990.000$ in bitcoins wait 1 hours becomes crypto milionaire -_-
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:26:15
I just chose this name because I liked Ant Shares the crypto currency. Now know as neo
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:30:25
yeah, I just trust blockchain tech. And think it will become mainstream in 2020/2021.
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:17:13
OP do you DONT inderstand you CANT predict the market. you can sell at 4400$ and the price could go too 4600$
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:21:58
you're a wise man
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:34:16
Idk, it your own decisions. But personaly I would wait. Well you ahould listen to me since I bought 0.1btc at 2800$
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:38:44
No need to anymore. Thinking about selling it
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:10:31
In theory it should be safe... but what if some one keylogs your computer, so if you get hacked. 
Idk, I just really like the idea of having a device wich everything is stored onto wich also cant be hacked.
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:05:49
90% is a lot tho. But yeah you can take the risk if you believe in bitcoin.
I have about 1/3 of my money invested but Im only 17 so cant afford to loose all my money if it goes down
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:46:21
Yeah that would be nice though
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:33:10
... you can predict the future right? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:24:44
This why I like r/bitcoin you just reacted so nice. 
I said sort of the same thing you said here on r/btc and get downvoted and called a idiot
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:12:50
in short term it did yeah
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:12:59
You dont understand it I cant explain, you will get hurt one day. It wont learn you. The market will
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:17:39
haha yeah Im glad the money is back in my bank acount. No need to check the charts all the time.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:34:36
yeah sell, so i can buy more
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:14:36
Yeah I agree, but im kinda scared these altcoins might over take bitcoin. Wich will be a pain for btc so also for altcoins. Because they always fall down wen bitcoin does
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:01:36
You shouldn't look at the price but at the market cap. If ripple wants to be 60 cents it would have to increase really big in mc. But I get your point alt coins make you more money, since a 1bil mc can easily double to 2bil. But 50bil not so easily to 100bil
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:20:37
Just buy some
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:19:30
Yeah my hope is that one of these coins will at least explode in the future since there is no telling wich will be the next neo (10x your money)
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:01:12
Thats why you dont use the same password on a exchange + mail. And also have your F2A and email conformations availble
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:28:11
For buying: Coinsbase or try a localy btc website (one from your own country)
For trading: Bittrex Most secure imo.
Or poloniex (having scaling isues) but lower transaction fees than bittrex.
For checking prices: Coinmarketcap.com and you can keep a online portifolio such as "coin ticker" a ios app.
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:14:15
segwit is be put in to use tommorow. Its a bitcoin scalling update. Right now there is some fud, since there always is before anouncementa. Just google it
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:14:56
Im talking about spliting bitcoin not hardforks haha jk.
Sorry we just have the same sence of memes
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:41:54
Yeah but remember I just a teenager. I make about 250$ from work. I just can't afford to loose a lot of money. I believe in bitcoin, but I can also see what happened in 2013/2014 It went down 75%. 
If I made like 25k-50k year. I would buy a whole coin but not right now.
It kinda sucks that I was born so late. I was 9 years old when bitcoin was founded so I had no chance to even be a early invester haha. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:11:44
ahh thats sucks... I currently use bitonic.nl it has almost zero fees. And doesnt need any personal info. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:21:02
Yeah, but making moneys comes with a risk dont forget that. You can also loose money
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:27:37
Ahh okay, ty
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:25:00
Can I get allerts with out an acount?
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:40:03
Its kinda personal + some of my friends know this acount and I dont want them to know about it. Hope you understand.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:37:02
how much btc invested?
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:08:31
No blockchain is a amazing concept that has a lot of growth potential. A lot of start up are building on it. I exspect a big growth when bitcoin becomes more mainstream rather something magical you can earn a lot of money from
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:09:08
Yeah I will never ever (panic) sell. Also just bought a ledger for my 2500$ in holdings
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:54:40
Yes you shouldnt have such a amount on a exchange since it can be hacked or coinbase can stop giving you acces from your coins. 
You should either generate your own private  paper wallet. Or maybe buy a Trezor/Ledger.
That is a device you order online. And it will store bitcoins on there.
Or you could have your own usb with your private keys on there.
Hope I helped
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:54:36
No its just creates cunfusion and takes the process out of btc
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:41:04
goed artikel
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:20:18
agreed, my parents are pretty modern so they understand with out that explanation
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:41:00
Im just really hoping a almost 2k investment as a 17-year old will pay off in my future hehe
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:20:09
sorry its hard to speak 3 langues correctly 
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:33:11
thanks for helping
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:52:13
yeah I probably saw your meme,saved it somewhere in my head and made it again
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:50:24
Yeah and newpapers also. There was a whole page about bitcoin in the biggest newspapers of my country. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:48:26
I didnt have a lot in the first place
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:33:41
dont worry about the security breach, I believe its patched and it only a physical hack so some1 has to take your trezor open it up and hook up into the interails of the trezor
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:52:44
I bought a coin like that like a year ago. It has no value
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:12:18
Yeah exsactly what I was thinking. I am happy enough the price stays above 4000.
btc cant grow 5% every day. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:53:41
I just listened to you and bought 0.15btc extra I now own 0.25 btc
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:15:10
If you have your private key in your gmail. You might as wel put it up on a highway billboard
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:48:40
You have nice guts then haha
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:31:54
People don't like the fact that you say the price can go down. Definatily the people who bought in at 3500-4000$ 
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:33:47
Why do people loose their wallets? like srsly
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:08:25
Thats your opion, I think some alts have a reason to be here. And they have been here since 2013. And still holding stong. I will definiatly believe some altcoins may vanish but some will rise
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:13:45
Never store it online, Just write it down and put it in your vault/secure place
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:43:53
Depends on the country. Most people use coinbase. So I would go with that. Bitonic.nl is also a very nice site where you can pay directly with your bank acount. only for dutch people tho.
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:22:45
dont advertise please
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:13:29
haha sure, see you in 5 years xd. No but you cant mess with a ledger its so secure I love it
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:25:47
Well 
10k btc = 1000$
100k btc = 10000$
And with the so called 1.000.000 btc where I dont believe in you will have 100.000$
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:21:46
Yeah thats way to complicated. Btw since you know a lot about bitcoin, bip39 and stuff. Where can I acces my BCH that was given to me on aug 1? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:07:19
that would chance my life, haha
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:07:00
Remind me in 5 years haha
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:22:21
I have 0.1 btc and 0.4btc in alt-coins (Mostly in ETH, Lisk, Stratis, Waves, Bitcoincash. But also in all the other coins. 
Smart decions?
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:48:03
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:10:21
nice lambo ;)
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:39:36
thats why you hold and dont worry about short term
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:41:41
Yeah thats was just before 15 jul then. The date when the new came out there would be no hard fork
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:06:36
I am just a 17 year old. And I had 7000€ in savings invested 2500$.
And after hearing al these horror story's of people getting hacked and loosing their btc or Mt Gox. closing down that stuff.
My plan is to hold but really just hold untill atleast 5x my investment and then sell a lite but keep most of it. My income is very low since I dont have a good paying job
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:43:46
yeah getting kinda tired of it
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:26:33
why not my reddit is 0% connected to my personal life. No one knows who I am, why should I worry?
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:13:03
Also 130$ in Bitcoin cash
Do think the investments are good?
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:07:11
mah dude. Thats so painfull haha you now have 5000$ choclate bars.
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:28:39
Look on youtube on what is is. And make sure you are knowong what you do before involving your money into it
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:23:55
Yeah, Hackers can do a lot. But not acces my future ledger wallet tho haha. Also you cant hack my paper with my btc on them
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:35:58
Yeah that was on bittrex I couldnt buy 10% than the current price.  
Yeah its just weird
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:27:57
Dude loosing a lot of money because of dumb decions on exchanges.
Says exchanges are shit and stupid scams.
Best laugh of the day pahahah xd
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:49:00
It has become so common. We are using it no longer as a joke but as a term
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:17:46
yeah there will bo so man bitcoins people will just get confused. I hope altcoin bitcoins just die off. And btc will surge
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:26:48
And then you hit a 0 or two extra and your btc will be locked for 100 years
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:23:53
Please use recent information from there site. They also support: Ripple, Stratis, Komodo.
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:04:55
Is there?
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:24:12
yes bitcoin died again
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:41:27
haha awesome dad
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:24:25
I like 1:5 ratio since I think alt coins can grow a lot more. But still if bitcoins really takes off and altcoins not so mich you still have a good amount.
Whell depending on your investment size, you should try to own 0.05 btc and the best imo is 0.1 and the rest in altcoina
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:38:46
Wow so from 900$ to 2000$ nice!
How did you know 1800$ was the bottom off the drop?
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:18:07
Btw how do I know its not just a scam who steals my private key (sorry if dumb question)
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:58:50
I only own 0.1 btc and 0.4 btc in altcoins
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:35:14
why 1 coin? it only a mentality to own a whole coin. I get that you want to bug a whole coin but 4k$ is a pretty big investment. I currently own 0.1btc and am happy with it
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:16:27
Ik snap je probleem niet... Waar heb je die 900€ naar toe gestuurd dan?
Deel dan je transactie ID dan kan ik meekijken
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:50:31
Just store your private keys in a bank deposit box's and tell them you dont want to have acces to it for 5 years. Ultimate HODL
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:15:08
Thanks for that link. I dont need to have it directly but I would like to have it just in case as an extra safety option. That I would be able to have my private keys idk.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:15:27
It is called "bitcoin" marked as btc thats how you recognise it
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:03:43
Gast je had echt ff meer moeten verdiepen in bitcoins zelf. Het ziet er na uit dat je alles zo maar ff gedaan hebt. Waarom ook meteen zo groot bedrag als je nog nooit uberhaupt een bitcoin transactie hebt gedaan.
Maar ik kan niet echt helpen gebruik geen blockchain als wallet en heb mijn btc ook niet bij btcdirect gekocht.
Wat is het transactie ID? dat kun je vinden in je email van btc. Daar kun je zien waar je btc zijn heen gestuurt. Check dat adres in de blockchain.

I have no idea how to acces my bitcoin with my private key. I have my private key incrypted via a Bip39 password (12-words)
So I can acces my bitcoin from different sites using that software, but I don't know where to find my private keys
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:26:53
Europe, but use $ in cryptos since it the same reason I talk english here
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:09:22
Yeah depends on what your trying to do.
Do you mind telling me what your investing in? and where
Maybe I can help to make it as cheap as possible :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:31:44
Because now it causes a lot of FUD. I will just wait and see I guess. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:05:02
Before hand you didnt know bitcoin was the best investment, next time try and predict the future lets see if your still right
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:16:20
exactly this
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:40:38
Bitcoin had really started to gain attention for only a small year, before that no one really knew about crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:56:29
Wow I have learned a lot since 110 days ago haha. Thanks for explaining that to me. I have now stored my coins securly btw :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:08:18
Bitcoin has been great for me. Im only 17 years of age. But had some increable gains. So I would recomment to invest. 200$ is enough if it really becomes mainstream someday.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:43:42
So what did you do?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:31:13
Okay at least your being honest. Sorry for being. so fired up vtw. Its just that the last few weeks I have seen so many people who know it all. And think they are the best. It just pisses me of.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:53:31
Soo did you buy back then? :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:12:51
1000$ game lol
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:45:28
No they still made 2500$ :p
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:49:14
Thats why you dont do weed
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:24:56
I can talk about what ever I want to people I am close with. If some one wants to steal from me, they can also just put a gun to my head and ask to bank transfer all my cash to them. Thats the same case for my btc, no one will do that tho. Since my family and friends arent criminals like everyones family and friends here on reddit. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:43:40
Same but am still up 35%
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:38:02
What history tells you isnt what the future will bring you. Everyone can make their own decisions in crypto. But calling all altcoins the close minded term "shitcoins" is wrong. There are good projects out there that might have a bright future. The are even coins out there that had better return than btc. Example ebtc 0.02$ &gt; 0.80$ or Ethos 0.05$&gt; 1.80$ and even coins that have been longer around like lisk. 
You would have been better of investing in your so called shit coin, Lisk. Would have given you better returns.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:05:19
I never do, holding for at least 2 years
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:05:51

I also started with 20$ and I am not even a student yet, but after a while I have spend way to much more.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:00:35
Just copy the wallet address
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:13:03
Probably fake, still if true dont give ALL your coins to charity also take care of yourself
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:28:36
Yeah correct, definatly with bitcoin diamond, only people who have their own private keys or used binace can sell it right now.
Hopefully ledger will give acces to spilt bitcoin diamond just like with bitcoin gold
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:37:08
I dont know either lets just look back in 2 years and see what happened

bitonic.nl doesnt ask for a ID. Its a legit site, transfered thousands of dollars thru there.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:07:06
Take what you are looking to invest. Devide it by 6. Buy 1/6 every week.
That way you wont buy all at the ath. Well you will if btc keeps going up.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:28:26
Yeah but what does bitcoin has over altcoins? in tech persepective
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:59:43
Respons to a other user: 
No the fact that im financial about alt is because there was being said: "Thats why you dont hold alts, you lost money blah blah" Then I said some coins haave had better returns than bitcoin.
Some altcoins DO have a real team behind them and a vision. You tell me, what kind of inavation is BTC bringing? there are better coins out there with lower fees and that are cheaper. People use bitcoin as a store of value since it was the first ever crypto. Not because of its so well devolped or innovative.
Some altcoins have really good developers or visions, seems like you never looked into alts well enough.
So coming back to your question some altcoins are bringing systems powered on the blockchain wich gives advantages.

@_date: 2017-11-29 14:02:17
lol yeah it was bought up in seconds
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:08:13
Nice I never sold my btc so am still holding on after buying at 3800$.
I also bought some vertcoin for 25$ at 0.55 a piece. Worth 215$ today. So an also doing fine :)
Poetfolio is up 50% in general 
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:45:15
If bitcoin would have stayed at 2000$ and alts coin would have gone up alot. then you would regret your choise. You just got lucky, there is no knowing wich coins go up. Dont act like your smarter since you invested in the right thing
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:01:00
This is old nice BTC is 11.175$ now xd
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:12:07
5k to 3k to 11k not bad
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:10:53
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:47:59
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:44:59
Haha look at the price now
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:31:43
I lost 0.33 bch by sending it to a bitcoin segwit adress... bch is just confusing for the normal people
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:58:51
250 BTC wall @ 11k was bought up in less then a minute
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:18:32
Yeah that why I used all my money out of airdrops in bitcoin and not in alts. Got an extra 0.15btc out of airdrops when bitcoin was 7000$ 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:44:20
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:33:32
What? I am ofcourse
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:02:15
Ever heared of dont invest what you cant afford to loose?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:16:22
Yep 0.0001 per dollar
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:11:44
where to sign up?
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:31:32
the things is, I dont know either, maybe altc will go up. Maybe bitcoin will go up. Maybe both, and I like to spread risk and not put all my eggs in one basket. Maybe you think it is smart to do so. But having a lot of alts makes me sleep well at night xd
I dont mind if  al money from alts go to btc since I still hold 55% in btc of my portfolio. 
I also think bitcoin is the safesf biggest grower.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:24:49
No you dont, Bitcoin cant be fully predicted. Dont act like you know what will happen. Iff bitcoin went to 13k you probably wont even tell us. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:57:49

so did you buy?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:00:39
300$ for a ledger 0_o xd
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:58:39
btw thats how crypto works,
You sell &gt; price go up
You buy &gt; price go down
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:57:57
Well at least you still profited, right? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:46:45
Lol yeah that happened at 10k till 11k
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:45:06
So that means it will always be the best?
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:23:38
good job
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:11:24
Although free money is nice, in my opinion these forks just confuse people. They take away some of the attention from the real bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:52:46
Thanks for telling me this 110 days ago. I followed your advise by buying more bitcoin instead of altcoins. Although my altcoins also profited. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:44:59
So that means it will always be the best?
@_date: 2019-04-10 13:13:53

bitcoin faucet gave you 22.500$ back in the day
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:17:03
Ahhh okay sorry to hear you went to that. I understand now. Still in my opinion it is different. Thats why they are called opinions
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:48:42
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:04:32
If you actually did that. Your a really smart man
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:42:58
Kinda agree, now they are both wrong. Scaming a scammer still makes you a scammer. 
Edit: Well I scammed scammers before. But at least you dont have to feel bad after doing so
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:10:30
yeah also that
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:58:44
1) I read a piece on reddit about how you use trezor on your computer and its more connected. Ledger only uses those 2 buttons and less information is send to the pc.
2) Didnt know that. But still ledger is more adviced for altcoins. Since it supports more altcoins
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:04:07
But segwit only has advantages so far I know right? 
I had the choice to choose from: legacy/segwit
Why would anyone pic legacy?
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:02:35
If I had read the white paper then what? I would understand bitcoin? No I already understand bitcoin so dont have the read the white paper.

Yeah that why I never sell. I honestly could live with myself if I had sold at 3k$. Then I would just instantly rebuy right now because of fear of missing out.
There was this guy posting a few hours ago: "Give me a good reason not to cash out right now" Well here is your reason

I used bread wallet and the 12 words you get, you can open yout btc anywere else like on coin.space for example.
With breadwallet they will never know your private key. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:01:07
yes hodl we do
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:44:40
Yes, definatly after I lost 125$ by sending to a wrong adress
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:33:05
Kim Jong-un should buy all the bitcoins just to fuck with JP morgan
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:35:02
Yeah.... they will probably all sell since they still want to get rid of their bitcoin. Still im holding on to my btc and not selling right now
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:45:47
I ment op kept his word
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:49:06
No I paid 0.91€, but the quality is fine for that price
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:16:36
Yeah but the money that went to the “pay gap” ““issue”” could have gone to health care and actually made a much bigger difference in people there lives.
Honest question: What do you value more a pay gap in a first world country where every one is almost always healty. Or poor childeren with bad health and education. Wirh no chances to even get a pay gap.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:52:39
With Gemini you DO NOT own your own bitcoin (since you dont have direct acces to it (pirvate key)). You are just assuming that gemini will give thoose bitcoins.
It is fine to buy bitcoins on Gemini, but you should transfer your btc to a wallet were you  DO own your private keys (So have direct acces) 
I suggest using Breadwallet an Ios based app. Were you will get 12-words. And those 12-words are you acces (private keys to your  bitcoins) So do not share them!
Thats all :) 
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:09:44
You forgot reddit, delet this
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:12:41
Yep, Sale has finished! Buy now or regret later (lol I honestly don't know we will see in a week)
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:25:36
Wait I dont understand?
Segwit is actived and is from Bitcoin core also is what you can call BITCOIN unlike with bcash or segwit2x coins.
BCash is a fork of bitcoin.
Segwit2X is a fork of bitcoin yet to be released
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:47:24

This again...
its not about hiw much money it is. It is about how much that money is worth to you.
A friend of mine bought a ledger since half of his money was into crypto and couldnt afford to loose it. Although it was less then 3k$
Dont tell people when to get a wallet as secure as you like
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:53:46
no I expect 5000$ CAD
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:26:48

@_date: 2017-09-17 19:13:32

@_date: 2017-09-16 00:46:15
Never panic sell. And try to buy low, like you just did. Also keep your bitcoins in a safe place :)
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:07:08
Do some more research though. I am not an expert and you may like different thing in a hardware wallet. I have chosen for the ledger.
Ledger support 10 coins if I remeber btw. But you can only have 3/4 apps on there. But you delete the apps again  to put all the 10 coins on there. 
Ledger has a better explination then I do. Sorry for my broken english haha.
Just google ledger and looks on forums :p
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:49:28

@_date: 2017-09-01 12:22:33
Every one thinks dofferent about these 2 hardware wallets still tho. 
Still hardware wallets are way more secure then hot wallets.
Ledger is secure they cant steal your money since they dont have your private keys
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:57:53
dont worry, it wont hold the 3700$ level I think
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:15:31
yep, i see haha
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:37:46
there was no sell off at 4k

@_date: 2017-09-01 11:46:55
When the company goes down you still have acces to your private key that you will store on a piece of paper. 
So you still have acces to your funds
You have 2 options Ledger/Trezor
Ledger (small device looks like usb with small screen on it)
Pros: Safer then trezor/ Altcoins / VERY safe
Cons: It costs money
Trezor (bit bigger then ledger)
Pros: Only bitcoin / VERY safe
Cons: costs money
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:12:55
Good job for you
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:40:28
True but, at 5k no body knew it would go down. At 3k you can almost be certain it would go up. Since 3k is a big bottem
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:51:18
hahahaha so funny xd
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:51:06

Yeah thats like something you never forget in your life. And the worse if btc becomes like 10k a coin. Than it will even hurt more.
Best case senario for this guy is if bitcoin becomes only 700$ a coin. Than the money lost isnt as much
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:54:40
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:55:10
what? you think I cant the purpose of bitcoin after investing more than 100 hours reading on sites / reddit. I learned a lot about btc and doesnt have to read to white paper to do so
@_date: 2017-09-24 13:01:17
Welcome to the club!
I also sent 120$ of BCH to a BTC address. 
Never will get my money back unless I can guess the private key of that bch addres :)
Lesson learned, hope you didnt loose more than I did
TL;DR  you will never get your money back
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:44:29
Although there is no disadventage in using it over legacy

this is how you make millions
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:49:28
haha great post
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:35:15
No problem :) glad I could help
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:28:14
The chance of your phone being hacked is very small imo. But you could setup a paper wallet. Look on youtube how to do it. But paper wallets can be lost or damaged. So are also not 100% safe. 
Imo you can use a hot wallet like breadwallet. Untill you reach a certain amount of coins then you just buy a trezor/ledger (hardware wallets)
Do your own research Im not an expert!
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:41:31
Ledger will probably do not support bitcoin gold. But they will give you easy acces to get a hold of your 2x
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:55:01
doenst make any sense. 99 of the volume is chinese. then with the ban around 95-99% more or less would disappear. And I dont think btc wil go back and loose 95% so it will be a few dollars
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:08:36
There is still a possibilty of your phone being hacked, thats why you can also use a hardware/paper wallet
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:22:11
Nice to hear its finally solved, crazy how things can be so simple once its solved.
I remeber the other puzzle being way harder.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:22:41
Maybe, idk. How ever I use a ledger and a admin from Ledger said my coins were lost. So no need to go and search for them
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:39:02
Do you know the site?
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:39:25
dont store coins on coinbase
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:22:07
Or you just write it down with a pen and paper
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:30:56
Your my hero!
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:05:15

hol' up
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:52:51
totally agree, selling seems tempting sometime, but you never know when it will go up again
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:36:47
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:44:06
better more fees that loosing it all
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:40:19
nice, please dont loose it like that other guy did. 
He lost 6 btc to hacker since he had it on a exchangge with no F2A
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:42:59
Yes and in 3 weeks you will regret not buying now at 3800$
!RemindMe 21 days
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:36:25
Yes very true people forget how hard is to hold coins in times of uncerainty in the early stages
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:11:40
Yeah that how markets work
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:19:25
Yeah but that chance is something you can almost rule out. The chance of your house burning completely down. And destroying your ledger +back up phrase is bigger. 
Also ledger has a office in france so I trust them and they are a really solid company imo
Also yes somethings I said werent correct that why I said im not an expert do your own research
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:52:19
2 factor authentoficator. so 2FA
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:12:52
Bitonic / No ID and only 100/200$ above btc price. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:31:42
So you had 20000$ invested and didnt even  cared to move it to a personal wallet were you owned your private keys.
Also didnt activate F2A... 
Im really sorry for your loss, but still you should never keep so much money in that way.
There is 0.01% of you getting that money back btw. 
On the brightside you made someone very happy with 20k
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:48:16

Same already invested all avaible money
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:00:15
I lost 0.3 my accident on 440$
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:47:07
My localbitcoin supply was also not working at 3000$. Couldnt had bought anyway but still. That would be a bummer
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:18:44
Yeah but why should you choose legacy over segwit wich is cheaper/faster
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:44:41
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:04:50
what is the time in china right now? sorry for getting that wrong then
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:52:51
totally agree, selling seems tempting sometime, but you never know when it will go up again
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:32:27
You should wait in my opinion chinese are a sleep right now
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:32:31
You kept your word
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:38:44
how should I know? we dont use am/pm here
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:29:53
Lesson learned? dont sell in a bear market
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:23:54
Chinese whales are just pumping and dumping. And spreading fear so they can buy again at low price
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:41:21
your talking after things had already happened. Try to make predictions and lets see if it is still as simple to see where things are going haha
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:00:03
What? I am not going to loose my btc in any way. If I sell I wont even use coinbase. Sivce I never used them. 
You have no idea how I mange my btc and buy/sell them frick off
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:39:59
Thats kinda sad/dumb you dont go to people on the street and ask for money. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:27:57
Wait I dont understand?
Segwit is actived and is from Bitcoin core also is what you can call BITCOIN unlike with bcash or segwit2x coins.
BCash is a fork of bitcoin.
Segwit2X is a fork of bitcoin yet to be released
Is this correct??
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:40:04
for scale
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:17:58
Yeah now he has:
A. No acount
B. No 150$
haha what a loser
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:33:11
Lol you just reposted this meme you saw a few weeks ago, lol
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:11:10
That is really smart but you can also sell high and then buy low. That is smarter but harder
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:01:48
Your a investing mastermind right? You can predict the market right? You know the bitcoin white paper by hard right? You are an EXPERT right?
Many people who bought bitcoin dont even understand what it is. I know more about bitcoin then most people who are in this game for 2 months just like I am.
Stop giving me shit dude
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:31:29
No worries dude relax, Just open a respond ticket like you did. The average response time is around 100 days so have fun waiting :(
Just spam poloniex and to get an answer. Othersewise you will have to wait
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:43:43
They will be very hard or solved way faster by someone else
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:53:43
it probably wont in the short term 
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:51:02
Why do you enclose it is a segwit address? any reason?
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:40:12

Sorry I dont know what a ponzi scheme is let me google it
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:48:31
Ah okay, thats why I wanted to hear about them but didnt get much info.
But m prediction was right tho, it going to happen someone is going to get scammed soon or later
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:47:24

Only buy when things are bearish
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:38:53
Yes took me an actual 2 minutes
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:44:51

Uhmmm let me copy the meaning of a prediction for you.
A prediction is a forecast, but not only about the weather. Pre means “before” and “diction” has to do with talking. So a prediction is a statement about the future. It’s a guess, sometimes based on facts or evidence, but not always.
Pretty clear imo
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:41:26
Let PF make his own choises.  Most btc millionaires dont donate any amount of money. PF has donated to so many cause s, of course one of them is not that good and the money could have went to something better.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:41:36
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:31:48
Yeah I that like the first thing you need to do. No matter how big the amount is
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:37:55
you paid the 25$
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:15:47
Bought back at 3200$? 4300 you mean. lol you got fooled xd
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:08:08
I use bitonic and it doesnt ask for anythigg not even my name
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:58:58
First rule of bitcoin: Dont sell bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:28:27
Most people bought in at +3000$ I think
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:43:14
nice predicting off the market dude
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:39:40
Idk,  but why doesnt he just create a new acount?
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:31:55
the reason my portfolio is still green is because of altcoins :)
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:51:05
bitconnect is also a scam, the roi is to hogh it cant sustain it self
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:59:23
Ah okay
btw: Why cant the scammer just create a new acount on that site?
