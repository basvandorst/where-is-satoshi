What can you say? Living fast, I guess? He came across reasonably well on the Joe Rogan show a while ago. In another life, perhaps we all could have been "him"

Number 10 is the biggest for me. I'd add, start small, make the mistakes with non life destroying amounts. Learn from your mistakes to improve for later, when your portfolio is large

Just learnt this lesson unintentionally this week: tried a stop loss order on my BTC this week, but the order completed on an extremely temporary dip. Fortunately I was able to buy back today, with about a 2% increase in my holdings. Still, wasn't much fun...

Was that buffet also?

Basically ditto for me, but I'll console you with what someone else told me - "everyone wishes they bought more and earlier"

This is one I'm wrestling with a bit now. The total amount of money I have in crypto completely matches what could be considered risky in the portfolio - about 10%. I haven't remortgaged a house or put in my life savings, for instance. Therefore if I get hit by a crash I'm not really hit, since there's no reason to be forced to sell. I can weather the crash and hold for the next bull.
Provided there is another bull. But that supposes the current bubble can completely destroy crypto's long term viability. That seems so be the question...?

Trailing stop loss means I'm out of BTC since 24 hrs. Can't complain about 133% gain, and I'll be honest these gains started to get terrifying... I can't see how this isn't going to crash...

Buuuuuuttt... only if he sells

Let's just say I put a fair bit of money into some stuff that's probably going to prove to be junk. Well don't know this yet, but I suspect so. Don't want to go into the details. Looking on the bright side, good to have these learning experiences sooner rather than later

Random question - do you guys carry your ledger around? I was for a while (keychain), but then started to think that was unnecessary, and a certain risk, so now it stays at home. Thoughts?

Well indeed. Hence why I stopped. But I do now have the problem that the wallet and seed words are effectively stored in the same "place". Currently considering options there. May store a copy at my mum's house, perhaps, for example

No. You can trade it for goods and services. It's just not yet week established for this 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:11:07
Absolutely. We should all be aware of our cognitive biases. 20/20 hindsight is one of the big ones! Likely I will be putting a similar amount in each month after some slightly larger buys during the last six months
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:50:37
Currently wondering if I might make it a goal to get to 1 BTC in the near future... Currently looking like costing about €5300 though ��
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:34:59
Same with me here. Ho hum, nothing ventured nothing gained
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:43:51
Yes you could be right, but I'm reluctant since this doesn't quite fit my strategy so far (not going for quick flips). This suits other people of course 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:41:51
Absolutely. It's good to repeat these kinds of sentiments and combat the cognitive biases we have

Sure, it's plan C, but it could end up being the only backup you have and is worth doing, in case you ever wish you had.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:19:43
Already looked into this. A bit expensive...
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:33:27
Makes me wish I'd put more in or didn't waste so much this year on other, seemingly more dubious "investments" ��
But oh well, I'm new in this game...

This is very important and something I did not at all realise until I got my ledger.
Pro tip: LEARN your 24 words. Use the story technique. I learnt mine by drawing two silly comic strips and marking out the Index of the first word in each panel. Then refresh your memory regularly by writing down all words on a piece of kitchen paper. Check you're correct and then burn the paper. Eventually you won't need to comic strips as reminders. I may still keep mine and store them separately as a backup. It's surprisingly easy to learn 24 words this way

Crash means an opportunity to buy. The highs set new parameters for its value. It will bounce back. Provided you're a HODLer ��

However, I used kraken for the first time this morning since last summer... And it worked. First time. Fast. Miracles can happen 
The mobile app is still shit, though
