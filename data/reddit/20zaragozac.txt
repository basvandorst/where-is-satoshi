All right, I'm around your age, I'm 15 and I was very interested in bitcoin like yourself and I kept telling my cousin that bitcoin was gonna get big and he seemed somewhat excited himself but I noticed that he didn't really take it too seriously, ive always been interested in the stock market and I thought this would be a great way to start off, with BTC and other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and litcoin having such dramatic oscillation in their prices I thought itd be a good place to start off with too and not be grudging the long days and weeks waiting for just one stock to go up by the smallest amount on etrade. I realized that the hardest part of starting is just that, all you have to do is make a plan and have the money to back it up I have a job and get a steady but small income which ive managed to save up. I came across this website, Coinbase.com, its basically your bitcoin and cryptocurrency broker its incredibly simple and for me, it didn't take to long to setup you just need easy access to your bank account and preferably through your phone, ive been on the site for about a week now, ive realized that you pay more fees if you use a debit card on coinbase but if you choose the option to use your bank account, fees are reduced to only one dollar but it takes about a week or a week and half for everything to be processed which makes things pretty complicated but overall Coinbase.com is a pretty great way to start off investing in bitcoin. You say you want to buy as soon as you can when you turn 18 but you can start sooner. You just need parent supervision and approval and remember invest only what youre willing to lose.
