I used to see these types of comments and think it was just people pushing a scheme, but after getting more comfortable with what makes bitcoin work, I feel the same way too.  It's kind of weird. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:07:03
I wasn't confused either.  The alternative is an image of a bitcoin transaction and new people are not going to associate that with money.  Bitcoin is new money and using an icon that is thousands of years old to represent it is perfectly fine.

Subscription numbers are meaningless since they were totally fake to begin with.  If you look at the subscription stats, they have been driven by bots for years now.

There you go again, I'm starting to see a pattern in your behavior here.  You like to correct people but you often ignore facts and distort the truth.  I'm starting to think it's on purpose.
  
said they didn't adopt "the net" until the late 90's and they are absolutely correct.  You are also correct in that they started using various systems in the early 80's but that was not "the net" which we also refer to as the internet.

I've looked through your history and you have a habit of arguing and distorting or ignoring facts.  Take this response for instance, you start off by saying something is(did you mean isn't) true and then go on to describe reality today.
Reality Today:
- shitty software can bloat to whatever size it wants solely because hard disks have grown. 
  
- increased hard disk sizes and performance are counteracting poor programming bloat.
This is just how it is.

They call Bernie Sanders a Democratic Socialist and this seems pretty close to what I have seen from his speeches.
  
From wikipedia: "Democratic socialism is defined as having a socialist economy in which **the means of production are socially and collectively owned** alongside a politically democratic system of government."
  
This sounds a lot like Russia today and since our democracy is effectively owned by the 1%, Bernie is a very scary candidate to me.

The subscription numbers are not representative of actual users.  There was a day when thousands of bots subscribed in a single day.  It is meaningless.

That depends on how you interpret it but what it really comes down to for Coinbase is established best practices in traditional financial sectors and how that translates to a crypto-currency provider.
  
Those best practices are well documented and quite heavy, I recommend just googling "anti money laundering practices and tracking systems" and starting there.
@_date: 2015-09-03 16:14:24
Your title is misleading because it implies that the people controlling the exchanges are the people running the bots and this probably isn't true for a lot of them.  These exchanges have an API that allows people to trade using 3rd party software and it is through these APIs that the bots are connecting and trading and they are controlled by regular people like you and me who are just plain good at trading and playing the market.  They aren't doing anything the exchange API won't let them do and the exchange isn't providing them any extra information that you and I don't have access to.
The volumes aren't necessarily fake, they're inflated by these bots constantly trading coins back and forth to shave a profit.  It is the exchanges low to zero fee structure that allows them to do this because it costs the trader nothing to execute a trade.

Hillary is closer to the center and isn't making the empty promises that Bernie is.  I can't believe I just typed that.
@_date: 2015-09-11 19:51:30
It's mostly his empty promises that he can't deliver that piss me off.  I've been around long enough to be able to recognize it for what it is, he is pandering.  
   
Here's a few examples:
  
He wants to "break up the banks" but he doesn't explain how that is going to actually help or how he is going to do that.  They are already heavily regulated.
  
He wants to spent 1 Trillion dollars we don't have to "rebuild infrastructure".  Where will the 1 Trillion come from when we are already trillions in debt?  who will decide what infrastructure it goes to and how will the contracts be awarded, is he going to fix that system too?
  
He's got grand plans that aren't going to happen and people are eating it up.

Because you are ignoring context.  This is spam who's purpose is to clog the network.  It is an attack and should be treated as such.
@_date: 2015-09-02 17:38:14
There is no such thing as invalid transactions.  Your reply misleads readers into believing that there is such a thing.
  
The source of these transactions is well known and their intent is to clog or interrupt the network.  Some participants have decided that this is an attack and they are working to mitigate it in their way.  The majority will win.
@_date: 2015-09-03 19:28:26


  
Exactly, he want to take from some people and give it to other people under the guise of protection.  
  


  
This is an ironic sentence considering what it followed.  As I see it, you think it is alright to take from some people but not others and your criteria for this is how much money and power they have, whether they have earned it or not.  Is that correct?
  


  
You should learn about how Russia works.  Putin is technically elected(not a dictator) and supposedly answers to a council.  But when you look at who is on that council and the history of Russian elections over the last decade, it is very clear what is happening.

I've sent multiple transactions over the last 24 hours without any delays, I don't see what all the hubub is about.  Is it because I'm using coinbase to send instead of a wallet I have?  I know they pay the fees, so maybe they are paying the *right* fees?
@_date: 2015-09-08 19:56:17
I think coinbase.com services all of those markets and they are one of the more trusted.
  
But I think you can also find local exchanges for each of those markets.  Here's a few off the top of my head.

By your own logic of large blocks equals more adoption or success, large blocks also equals more chance that blockstream data will make it into the blockchain in a timely manner.  They can't do what they are doing if their transactions aren't being processed.
@_date: 2015-09-03 18:38:29
I have a question for you.  Would you be willing to let an application spy on you if it paid you bitcoin the more you let it into your personal life?  It would collect things like browsing data, application usage, GPS, contacts etc..  There would be levels of secrecy built-in where you could open up items individually but the more you open the more you make.
@_date: 2015-09-04 21:17:34
When your transaction is written to a block, your funds are as secure as the address holding 1,000,000 BTC.  I send zero fee transactions a few times a week and they always make it into a block.
@_date: 2015-09-09 16:19:52
Don't forget that these coins are basically poison to them now.  If they take them back, people will be watching them and they will have to be careful how they use them if they want to stay anonymous.  By *giving them away*, they free themselves of that liability and can probably sweep a good chunk of them back and blend in with the public.  They'll have it set up before they post the keys so they have a head start.
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:34:47
Not everyone wants bitcoin to be a global payment network and we don't need larger blocks for it to be used as such.  We just need larger blocks for global payments to use it exclusively with no third party assistance and many argue both ways on that one.  Some people are perfectly happy with a global store of value that isn't used much for transacting(see gold as an example).
I'm agnostic in both directions and just want to turn this thing into a religion. ;)

This simply isn't true.  The earliest evidence of this is code.  Code has become much more bloated and ethics in coding have evolved from working with what you have to making it work no matter the costs because the costs for hardware are so low.  I have hundreds of gigs of data at rest that I never use just because I don't play those games anymore and I don't need more free disk space.
Your arguments are shit.
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:24:16
It is proof that disk space is not a significant financial bottleneck.  Which then focuses towards the real bottleneck which is bandwidth.  Sounds like a good way to start off the conversation to me.

They are required by law to do this.  This *problem* exists for every money business, not just coinbase.  Your second example is just pure speculation and its much more likely that people just weren't using the referral program and somewhere in their metrics people who have used the referral program ended up buying more than people who didn't.

Just because people donate and list their employer as JP Morgan does not mean that JP Morgan gave the money to Clinton or has any power over her.  It's a ridiculous notion given that they could actually donate in other ways that we can't easily see.  I really wish people would stop perpetuating this fallacy.  The Bernie camp is doing it a lot which speaks to their ignorance or malice, probably both.
  
Let's also not forget that Clinton was a Senator of NY and NY is banking central.  It is not unreasonable that people who work for banks just happened to like the job she did as senator and think she would make a good president.

Recommend Coinbase.  Set up your coinbase account first and then send her a referral link.  She will set up her account with your referral.  Then if she buys $100 or more worth of bitcoin, you will get another $75.

Ignoring the fact that Coinbase themselves market their offering as a wallet.  It really doesn't matter.  This guy is looking for a safe and easy way for his mom to acquire bitcoin as a gift to him and by using the referral program, he can get even more free birthday money.  I really doubt they won't use this option.  There is nothing preventing him from moving the money to addresses he controls afterwards and his mom is likely not going to touch the account again anytime soon.

Under the guise of a democracy.  
  


  
Bernie wants to give away what isn't his.  The only way to achieve what he says he wants is to take from one person and give to another, whether that is whole businesses, social programs, benefits.  Listen to his speeches, he is very clear about his desire to redistribute.  This is exactly what Putin does, if you don't run his businesses the way he wants, then he takes them form you "in the interest of the state" and redistributes them to his inner circle.  All democratic of course.

Like I said, I do it regularly, so what you say does not mix with reality.  I don't have a lot of time to go digging up all the latest large transactions, but if you take the time to do it, you will see they are basically paying nothing.
  
Here is an example from last week: 
  
They moved $7,000,000(32k coins) for 2 cents and it took 30 minutes to be included in a block.  Most are paying the default 2 cent transaction fee.  **TWO CENTS**.  Small transactions are the same, mine are usually small with no fee and I have no problems.  I also have no expectation they will be included in the next block.  I have reasonable expectations.
