Now I know and like more people to be aware of the risks using this device.

I just like to bring **awareness** to the issue. What is happening to me might happen to you or anyone else that have Opendime. In my case, there was (hopefully still is) just small amount of coin. Some smart people advice me right: "Never put more than you can loose in anything crypto".


The simple truth is there is no manual what to do in situations as this. In faq's it says  "simply push it through the hole pointed by the arrow"


Yes maybe you right. Maybe I should have but taking the cover off seamed as logical step  to get access to the hole.
Second , what should have I documented. Install surveillance camera to record every time the device is plug on and off ? It just happened  from not thigh enough usb connection.
Then in panic I try to  "simply push it through the hole" in hope that this will reveal somehow the privet key. That proved to be more harder than it sounds so I assumed the silicon have to be taken off. 
**Let me reassure you . The device was bricked before I striped the cover.**


If that is true then you should not be so fast to "call it bullshit".
I still have one more dime. I will try to replicate the issue and document it but that would not bring my coins back anyway.

If you do so, please tell.
Bitcoin's strength is the community.
Why should I or you trust Opendime to return the coins?
What is going to happen in same situation in a year or two when the company might not exist  or charge high fee to resolve situations like that or how knows what?

is that means my coins are gone?
