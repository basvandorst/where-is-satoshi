Sure thing. How are you doing it now?

Happy to help!
First off, congrats on getting something up and running, that in itself is no easy task.I started my own project about 2 years ago but for creating real-time recommendations for day trading based off of sudden changes in public sentiment. As you say, it's hard to do with little time so I know work for a company that does. First question, are you wanting to do social only? Or also news coverage? 
For social, most social tracking services will go back at most ( on average, and this for enriched data, you could go back as far as you want in the native platforms) 12 months and this is usually done by getting API access from twitter, FB etc and I'll get you more info on that in a sec. For the sentiment analysis, I assume you're using some sort of NLP?

Hey, thanks for this. I should have clarified more so on making an alert based system that signals ahead of time. 
Do you know where they are pulling the coverage for this by the way? I have their numbers off by a factor of 2000 percent for any given hashtag or keyword.

Yea it won't be overly hard to show; just from pulling the raw data in tables already shows a pretty glaring correlation between both total number of mentions and respective sentiment and the direct impact on price. I am not looking for funding or anything like that, more so what people want me to pull.

RSS feeds are good for aggregating sources, but within that, you need a way to refine from there. What context are you looking for in terms of the mentions. Specific coins in conjunction with something or certain coins mentioned from certain sources etc?

I got an error, apparently, OP's mom is too large to track properly, getting a file size error.

Hey great work and not to discourage you at all, but.... This exists and is a pretty large software space. I work for a large company that does this plus all other media intelligence reporting. If anyone here wants me to pull any data let me know.

Ok, here is a really really basic idea of what I can set up. I did this during lunch so only had about 10 minutes. Can build much more in depth later and by requests. Can also post to the main subreddit if preferred.

Thanks again. I feel like I should connect with this guy. He has the back end part down equating the correlations, but the sources and content should be different. It needs to use boolean to account for any iteration of how that coin could be mentioned. It would also need to access content past the twitter firehose and additional sources not included without a monitoring program which I am happy to give him the data for at no cost. It's the difference between about 40,000 sources and 500,000, not including blogs which adds 500 million . The sentiment is also calculated with an NLP algorithm but can also be manually changed if the masses disagree. Just for the record, not trying to sell anything or push a product. Just trying to get the best possible data. I have all the media monitoring down to a T, but could use help on the other portion, maybe this would be perfect fit
