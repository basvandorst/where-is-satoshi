I spent two hours on the phone with Cap One informing them how disruptive this ban has been to my business and the employees whom I pay a decent % of their salary in bitcoin. Give them a call and escalate to a Manager to be heard. 
My biggest issue was that it wasn't even announced. I just suddenly could no longer use my card.

they're outstanding as a service company, bar none, but this snafu has left a bad taste in my mouth. i won't leave them but they need to know how badly it affected people. they said it is likely to be a temporary ban until they understand the industry better. but still, it shouldn't have happened in the first place
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:42
right but who is on either end of those trades? they have to buy a lot to drive the price up only to sell it all and the price will fall... that would be a zero sum game..

even if it was 1 trillion per coin, it's still obtainable. fractions of a coin. Also, the expectations of CBOEs affect on the price are already baked in. We might see a little change when China wakes up, but for the most part this is already incorporated in the price

I think there are a few things going on here. First, Segwit was a great first step but still hasn't been adopted by the majority of the network - opportunity there for quick, secure, short term fix. Second, I think the block size does need to be increased but after studying the economics in extreme detail, it makes sense to me that block size should act similarly to mining difficulty, changing bi-weekly to a limit that accommodates both relatively low fees, but also limits the ability to spam the network for low costs. 
These are just my thoughts. Happy to take feedback from people.

right, because it's not used for transactions daily transactions. bitcoin risks becoming a store of value if people just hold it. The solution is not to sell, but to spend.

Welcome to the community! My suggestion would be to do a bit of reading on the topic. I started researching a long time ago by reading the wikipedia article and the original white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto that describes how the system works. It's really fascinating but there's a lot to it. Read as much as you can and be informed. You'll then know whether it makes sense to buy bitcoin or not. Best of luck!!

The laws are still a little grey but most likely forked coins will be treated like dividends, meaning you will have to pay tax on the value of the forked coins you receive at the time of the fork. Contact a crypto specific attorney for how to handle this one...

the longest chain isn't the decider in a hard fork, only in a soft fork. I can fork bitcoin and modify the code to mine 100 blocks per minute resulting in a much longer chain than the original, but that wouldn't make it the "real" bitcoin. 
The "true" bitcoin is a bit more nebulous. In my opinion it's more accurate to say that the real bitcoin is the one most people support and use.

You should have the same amount of bcash as you had bitcoin on aug 1. The protocol support split into two versions so people who had coins before the blockchain split now have the same number of coins on both chains. It is EXACTLY like free money, except if it hadn’t split, it’s arguable that bitcoin would be higher by the value that bcash is right now. So it’s not really free money, it’s just splitting the communities support between two competing chains

It's actually even more fundamental than that. The ledger on the blockchain only tracks unspent transactions. You can think of it like unspent balances that a private key has the right to sign and send.

Bcash is “run” the same way as bitcoin. The people in charge of the site are a bit egregious but the protocols are essentially the same with a few minor differences. I agree that it’s deceptive though in how the group behind it tries to mislead newcomers into thinking that it’s the “real bitcoin”

um.. it depends on how the wallet was created and where it was stored. this ^ isn't completely true
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:12:14
^ Redditor for 2 months. 
I'm sorry, but that's not true. There are many ways to set up a wallet. Everything from a wallet on line with 12 word seed phrases to cold storage paper wallets (and even just memorizing your private key with no physical backup). Seed phrase backups are only one form. If OP had his/her wallet stored on a hard drive without making a backup of the wallet.dat file, there is no way to "recover" the wallet.

While I can understand your perspective, I respectfully disagree. The internet is not an individual's (or group of) service, it is a decentralized network of content contributors and information providers. Service providers only provide *access* to this information. They are not the ones creating the content, so they should not be able to decide who gets to access what and at what price. 
With respect to healthcare, again I respectfully disagree. Your mentality is basically a survival of the fittest, i.e. can't afford healthcare, then you deserve to be sick and die. While this might be an appropriate model for capitalism, I don't think it's morally aligned to deny coverage to people who can't afford it. This is getting of topic though.

Right but there's a reason utility companies are regulated. Electricity and water are considered basic necessities. Internet fits the same bill. The problem with ISPs is that they are essentially oligopolies. Alternative options are inferior and/or much more expensive, which creates a significant barrier to entry for new competition. In much the same reason that government intervention is beneficial in the case of monopolies, it too is necessary for oligopolies such as ISPs

E.g. you buy $1000 of Bitcoin, it goes up to $1200 in value. You then convert to $1200 of alt coin, requiring you to pay gains on the $200. Then if alt goes to $0 you can write that as a loss of $1200, meaning you would end up with a net loss of $1000.

then why are you buying it. and if your answer is to hold because the value will go up and that's the same sentiment as the rest of the market, it will inevitably crash. The beauty in that event happening is that this will cause fees to drop and then people will use it as a currency again. It's a balancing effect.
Right now fees are so high because of the quick value increase. Once it stabilizes, fees will drop

Yes, it’s definitely possible to send coins and not allow the public to see where they went, however the original public address will show that some were sent, which is the indicator people are watching for to confirm someone still controls those keys.. it’s more just knowing that someone has access than it is following where they go

You're arguing in favor of the company rather than in favor of the people. The problem is, companies are driven by revenues, not anything else. Government steps in to impose regulations when companies can take advantage of people in pursuit of their revenues, such as the net neutrality case
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:31:46
The price is actually pretty stable right now. If you consider it to be bouncing between $166 and $170 dollars, it doesn't psychologically seem like that big of a swing. But since we're in the thousands now, it looks more volatile. It's actually not dropping at all compared to past sell-offs. I could easily see a 4-5k drop soon to shake out some of the hype buyers of the past couple weeks.

be very careful. the best way to not have bad side effects is to keep doing what you were doing, just make small changes for the things you didn't like. Maybe you're passionate about your job but 50 hours a week was a lot -&gt; cut back to part time or seasonal work. Maybe you enjoy traveling -&gt; add an extra couple trips a year. Big drastic changes like some of the ones you mentioned will lead to more isolation and less self satisfaction after a short while. And you'll also have spent all your money

Following your logic, police aren't necessary for to live or work, should we get rid of the government funding for them? Roads are not required to live or work, should we stop building them? 
Smaller providers have discounts because they can't compete, and every single time they either go out of business or are acquired by the giants. There is *very* little competition and the barriers to entry make it highly unattractive for new competitors to join the space. 
In my area we have two choices - Spectrum (who has proceeded to purchase nearly every smaller ISP on the east coast) or Dish. I live in one of the largest cities on the East. This is not an open market. Net Neutrality is giving the giants even more competitive edge over new entrants and will only strengthen the oligopoly that has become ISPs

the real bitcoin is whichever fork you decide to support and use. Bitcoin itself will increase block size in the future. It was forked into bitcoin cash because a group of people believed it needed to be done sooner than later. There are some other differences but that was the root of why the fork occurred.

Disagree. Spending bitcoin creates utility value for the currency use-case. The more people who are able to spend it (without significant fees), the more people who will adopt bitcoin. The more people who adopt it, the higher the exchange value will be. Spending is a very important key piece of this whole system. Nothing can be a store of value by itself.

no. big short issues were driven by regulation and people breaking rules around that. bitcoin is deregulated so there's no way to "bypass" the regulation. It's so transparent that any danger of a crisis would be noticed by the community before it became a problem. The subprime mortgage junk bonds were so complex and opaque, almost no one understood them (except the few people who got out or got rich off of the signs). Bitcoin is easy to understand and transparent. So short answer, no.
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:42:58
Now that I have the wallet file backed up in several locations I don't need to touch it again, correct? I can just transact as I would and if I ever damage my computer/harddrive I can just restore the backup wallet and all current balance should be there, yes?

oh ok, so that sounds rather simple. I could save it on 5 or 6 USBs and throw a couple in the safe, one at a friends and one in the Safety deposit box?
Then recovering, how would I go about that?
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:32:01
if I lost/damaged the hard drive that core is on, would I have to re download it before being able to access my bitcoin from a backup?
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:53:46
ah ok, so then this might actually be a solution to the bitcoin unlimited issue I figured there might be... in BU, with blocks that can contain as many transactions as the miner wants, all transactions would be confirmed within ten minutes and there would be no incentive to provide a transaction fee. But if the size of the block has the potential to limit which block is propagated faster in the case of a mining tie, perhaps it would incentives miners to select some lesser amount to include in their block so that if they mine it at the same time as someone else and theirs is smaller it will be seen quicker and added to the chain quicker. 
That makes sense. Would appreciate if anyone has any thoughts on this thinking
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:36:23
Forgive my ignorance, but did Silk Road offer any solutions to these problems? I feel like especially in the drug market, large amounts of money could get scammed, so I'm a little surprised it was such a success.

Respectfully, I understand markets quite well and have been involved in bitcoin for quite a while. Yes the drop is because of more sellers than buyers - question is about what is causing More Sellers than Buyers. What's going on in China most likely worried holders of bitcoin around the world that their exchanges could do the same so some are pulling out (increasing the number of sellers...) I just wanted to hear if anyone had any other information on what's going on.
@_date: 2017-02-22 23:25:10
I wouldn't. Day trading is not worth it in bitcoinville. buy and hold, you'll be better off.
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:19:30
it's my understanding that the amount of data in a block (i.e. the number of transactions) doesn't affect the amount of time it takes to mine it. Mining is based, I believe, on the header hash, which is set to be roughly equal in difficulty to the current difficulty level..  someone correct me if I'm wrong. I'm newish to the deep level understanding of bitcoin blockchain but trying to catch up quickly
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:44:55

The only limit Coinbase should have is on purchasing/selling bitcoin, but transacting it should be unlimited
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:32:01
I think this is actually a great lead in to a question I've had, which is: how many people do you think are using/holding bitcoin (different than the number of accounts, i.g. I, myself have about 7 wallets)? Further, how many unique individuals do you think have .5 coins, 1 coin, 5 coins, 100 coins, 10000 coins, etc.? Answers to these would be interesting ... 
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:24:02
my goal is just to own bitcoin because when I retire I won't have to convert it to any other currencies... it will be the currency standard
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:43:33
and is an instant purchase on Coinbase
@_date: 2017-02-19 15:29:18
What I do in these cases is come up with some substantiated value of the % probability that the company will fail. I then multiply that by the value of the position and include that portion in my net work calculation. 
Example: Investment in Bitcoin Startup XYZ = $100,000
*Current* probability that the company will go no where and shrivel up into nothing ~ 80%
Current value of company for net worth purposes = (100%-80%) x $100,000 = $20,000. 
I adjust my probability percentages each time I calculate out my net worth. The effect of this is a smoothing effect for the rise and fall of the investment value but more accurately reflects what it is truly worth. 
Note: I don't do this for stock and other main types of investments, only highly speculative positions as the probability of a company that I've purchased stock in is significantly lower for them to go bankrupt (though of course still entirely possible)
Hope this helps give you some ideas to play with!

I put $4k into it. I've gotten back about $1800 so far but only make about $5 per day. In terms of bitcoin I would have been better off buying 8 coins. So far I have only earned about 3.75... I earn .005 per day and it decreases about every other week by 20% 
Thanks for your sentiments and I agree we might want to organize a call among the community. This is something I have no experience with but are there others interested in pursuing this? 
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:43:24
other than the fact that it's risen 40% + in the past few months?... 
@_date: 2017-02-26 01:16:18
That makes a lot of sense. So basically it's the level of error the community feels comfortable with, in this case roughly 2%
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:55:11
Aside from the fact that quantum computing will kill bitcoin in X years anyway... why do you say that bitcoin will be unusable as more and more is lost? The answer is just that the remaining coin will become more and more decimalized and broken into tinier pieces... No issue there.
@_date: 2017-02-23 04:13:52
yeah but I can't buy it until there are funds in the USD wallet? oh actually I think I figured out after the fact that I could buy it and then it would automatically transfer out of my bank account after 14 days but there was a larger fee so I would wire the money to the usd wallet in coin base and then purchase. but I guess I could have just bought it straight out for a slightly higher fee (still less than credit card). 
oh well, I get 2% cash back on my credit card so it's the same as a 2% fee (4% CC fee - 2% cash back)
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:58:03

@_date: 2017-02-27 20:25:39
It might just be good if the app provided some science based solution on top of the "knowing the person" argument. I can see a LOT of people losing their money because of this..  I know my brother well, and I know he can probably pay me back, but I still won't lend him money at 25% through an app. I'd rather give it to him outside the app, subtract the 60% app fee, and give him a 12% rate. I make more than the 10% I would get through the app, and he gets money at a rate lower than his credit card. No middle man. Better option.
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:46:12
well, as I don't necessarily think your math is quite correct, your statement is... but this analysis also doesn't take into account that after the drop bitcoin will probably just start the steady climb again like it did before the ETF was a buzzword.

I'm not sure what exactly the post means... "thousands more in profits"? If the ETF is approved and the price goes up, you would want to hold anyway because it's only going to continue to grow so knowing early has no value. The only value would be in knowing if it isn't approved, in which case a few moments noticed might save you from deep Losses.. but not profits..

6 month is still speculation and too risky. definite possibility of a large dip. You can't rely on a $100/month increase. if you buy, buy and hodl long term. If you need the money to pay for stuff, only put into bitcoin what you're willing to lose.

@_date: 2017-02-28 20:54:48
actually, that's only true of stocks, bonds, all those other investment instruments... currency, which bitcoin is for all intensive purposes, doesn't have to be traded out to realize the profit if you can spend it on goods.
Think of it this way.. if in 30 years, bitcoin is the currency standard of the world, you won't need to convert it to USD or any other currencies so you already realized the profit because of it's fungibility :) :)

@_date: 2017-02-07 16:23:51
I think the author brings up an interesting point. The nature of bitcoin is such that it highly incentivizes users to "hold" rather than spend bitcoin, since they have the expectation that the price will increase so drastically. That being the case, until it reaches quite a stabilized price point that no longer fluctuates double digit percentages each month, the author is right in that bitcoin might have some flaws as an alternative to fiat currency. (some perspective - I am and have been an avid bitcoin buyer for quite a while now and I fall guilty to this mindset)
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:50:32
If you're wondering about real time account balance, the balance total lags by a few minutes so it can be higher or lower than what the actual value is.. it's just an app issue, but if you tried to sell you'd be fine.

quantum is not a threat BECAUSE the protocol can be changed to keep up with it. when quantum becomes a reality and others are able to harness its power, protocol will be upgraded so that it is not a threat...

course, I prolly shouldn't talk. I put half of my loans into bitcoin a while ago. worked out well for me
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:29:59
also as user adoption increases, transaction volume will increase, leading to many more fees... it makes sense that miners should adopt segwit with the long term perspective in mind... no?

Thank you, this is all really helpful. I'm slowly building up a much deeper understanding of the inner workings of bitcoin. all very interesting
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:57:21
Unfortunately when I first got into bitcoin a year ago I fell victim to Genesis. Any thoughts on how I can ask them for even part of my money back? I invested in them and in terms of BTC return I've made back about 40% of what I spent (in bitcoin). Thanks to bitcoin value increase I'm about even but would have done a lot better using my cash for BTC. At the rate I receive new coin each day right now it will take me 700+ days to break even and knowing that rate is decreasing every day I'm sure I'll never get my initial base back. 
That said I think I can convince GM to give me at least something to cash out (I did this successfully before with an Etherium contract I purchased from them) but I would need some leverage in terms of how many people I could deter from signing up with them... 
Thoughts anyone?
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:19:01
even a bank wire takes several days to process. If you have reason to believe the price is going to increase significantly (such as in this case - which of course is just speculation and I don't necessarily endorse it in the first place), then you would have to factor in the discount you would get from purchasing instantly on a CC. 
I've purchased several times through bank transfer/wire transfers and all of them have resulted in me paying more than I would have if I had just purchased instantly on a credit card and then used the fiat funds to pay off the card (factoring in fees, increase in BTC value, etc) so I just buy on a card to have the reassurance that I'm not missing a ride up. So far it's worked better that way (probably because bitcoin generally has been going steadily up for the past year)
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:37:25
I tried it with literally $0.25 USD just to test it and wasn't charged any fees for neither the sell nor the transfer to my bank... not sure if it's just cause it was such a small amount or because they don't charge a sell/transfer fee
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:47:09
someone being able to hash a private key from a public key... first time that happens, devs will be all over the QC update and fast
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:49:47
no worries, we'll see what happens. If the betting markets are sufficient in size, they are representative of the sentiment of the greater market.. If 30% of people believe the ETF will be approved, that creates buying pressure at higher price points than without an ETF... the current price (though it reflects many other elements) is a result of the expectations of the ETF by the entire community. 30% think it will be approved, ergo the price is probably inflated by around ~30%... 
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:54:47

@_date: 2017-02-14 23:44:23
so to make another "statement", during that time, the value has gone from ~$400 to ~$1000... wouldn't this mean that transaction volume is not a good indicator of bitcoin value increasing? ...

would it make sense for the devs to just increase the block size by some percentage or ratio relative to the unconfirmed txs? This would solve the scaling issue but limit the size of the block so as not to ward off higher txs fees for miners... ?

I would guess a $400 drop followed by a $200 rise back up to $900+ all in the first day or two and then a slow and steady rise back to $1000 + ... 
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:09:24
you may want to read some of the previous threads. with all the mooners talking some of the estimates get pretty outrageous but in general, if it's approved, it means there is a much broader base of investors with access to investing in bitcoin. this should increase the value as well as raise awareness (good thing too)
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:42:39
Now that I have the wallet file backed up in several locations I don't need to touch it again, correct? I can just transact as I would and if I ever damage my computer/harddrive I can just restore the backup wallet and all current balance should be there, yes?

Sure it will. If you can brute a private key from a public, game over.

Buy on credit card. That's what I do. By the time I get fund into my account, price of bitcoin has usually gone up 4% or more. With the 2% cash back rewards, I'm only paying a 2% premium anyway. Worth the time savings.

@_date: 2017-02-19 15:10:45
I would say it's more effective to tell everyone you know about it. adoption in the long run is what will drive the value (not just currency value but applicability/usability value) higher over time.
@_date: 2017-02-15 17:40:51
it's still so new and adoption is relatively low but promising. definitely haven't missed the boat my friend. (my sentiments at least, and I'm not one of the to-the-moon folks with unrealistic expectations in this community :) realistically I think it will still continue to grow in popularity and the value will rise accordingly)
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:31:06
is etherium at all a threat to bitcoin, given the basic nature of it's blockchain and the structure of the contracting ability?
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:09:42
@_date: 2017-02-26 00:33:28
two things, ... could the community as a whole, decide to lower the difficulty by forging longer minings times for the next (2 weesks ish) 2016 blocks so that when it's adjusted it will be lowered? Which would result in easier mining? Or is it just so outrageous that it would never happen?
Also I've not found anything yet on why 2016 blocks? Is it just because it's roughly 2 weeks? (Which also seems arbitrary to me)
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:39:41
Completely agree. I've been researching this since around May of last year and the transactions costs for international trade financing can be incredibly high. With Bitcoin and smart contract escrow accounts, fees could be as small as a percent or less. On orders crossing the several hundred million dollar mark, that's significant savings. 
My background is in finance and international economics. I'm willing to work on a project to tackle this with someone who knows a bit more of the computer science side for smart contract programming. PM me if you're interested
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:16:41
That's what the community has been waiting for. The addition of these friends is what will tip the balance and send this thing to the moon. So glad they finally asked you :)
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:46:08
Yup, it was sometime in April, May or June of last year (I kept adding to my position thinking it was a good idea). To be honest, I wouldn't have anything bad to say about the company if they were able to refund the percentage of my investment that I haven't gotten back through mining and just canceled my contract. I just haven't figured out how to go about asking..

I think the reason we're seeing such black swan results though, is because is still so new and not widely adopted (relative terms here). I expect we will see it start to shape up to other asset classes later on in the future when we see widespread adoption and comparable market caps. Great post btw
@_date: 2017-02-27 02:23:43
absolutely true. but if this advanced cryptography is implemented now, there are no miners with quantum computers so blocks would take eons to mine... it doesn't make sense to implement until the technology is available.
Right now the current crypto algorithm is used to mitigate the difficulty level of how long it should take to validate a block of transactions. the goal is that it should take roughly 10 minutes. This is based on the hashpower of current mining hardware technology. the average of the best mining equipment takes about 10 minutes to mine a block on average. 
Once quantum computers are available, the time it takes to process a block will be significantly less than 10 minutes, which will require the algorithms to become more advanced making it harder to mine and bringing the time back up to 10 minutes on average. If it were introduced before people had quantum computers, no one would be able to mine a block in 10 minutes and the system would not work...

@_date: 2017-02-15 02:59:00
True, I will say however that at the time I purchased the contract I read through it line by line and no where did they say what the fees were, only that they were minimal. My fault for taking that at face value. Also I'm not complaining about it. I've already written it off as a partial loss. I was just probing for ideas or advice from anyone who has been successful getting any refunds from GM. I've obviously learned a LOT more about bitcoin in the past year and fully recognize my naivety haha. It's kind of comical actually. All the signs should have been red flags but I think I was jaded by the excitement of the "lifetime mining contract" verbiage :)

the market cap.... if the ETF is approved, estimates peg new money flowing into the currency at around 100 billion... that would be 5 times higher than the current market cap of 20 billion

@_date: 2017-02-21 17:35:36
purely based on the aggregation of being involved in financial analysis for so long. Those aren't hard numbers, point is just that we will probably see a drop of around 15-30% (ish), a bounce back of 10% (ish), all relatively quickly, and then stabilization with the current upward trend in the weeks following. It is definitely a persistent patten when bad news hits any market. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:14:55
Interesting. I agree that they are probably closer to approving than they have been before. Still not sure if it's a green light but this definitely changes my overall perspective.

With all due respect, I didn't propose a lawsuit, whomever I replied to proposed one. And more importantly, what I mentioned in my last response is not in any way fraudulent. People can enter into a contract, become unsatisfied with the product or service and request compensation, it happens every day in business. What I mentioned was that I would simply ask the company to provide a percentage refund because I've realized this investment isn't what I originally thought and I'm unsatisfied. If they felt kind enough to refund me any amount it would have been out of simple good customer service. If they did not, I would still be in the same place I am now, in a contract that I'm not fully satisfied with but still mining. 
Chargeback fraud would be if I had benefitted from the transaction in any way and then asked my credit card company for example to refund the purchase and dispute the claim, none of which I am doing. 
I appreciate your passion and it sounds like you work for Genesis Mining, but please keep in mind that the sentiment of this community is that they are doing nothing short of taking someones money and giving back 90% of it and pocketing the rest for themselves. There is materially no difference in doing that and in offering cloud mining contracts, especially since no one will reach a return on their initial investment when entering into a contract with GM.

@_date: 2017-02-18 18:52:52
It depends on how much you have and how risk averse you are. If you are holding a significant amount of value and don't want to risk them being lost, yes a hardware wallet is generally a good idea. However they can have a (significant?) cost associated with them. Think of it at an insurance fee for a more secure wallet. Obviously if you have a couple hundred dollars of bitcoin, spending $85 or $100 on a hardware wallet wouldn't make sense. But if you have $10K +, it might be worth the extra security. 
You could also hold in several mobile wallets to diversify the risk and spread your accounts. Many different options. (which actually made me start wondering if this would become a problem with large value adopters in the more mainstream. See my post from a little earlier.. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:35:54
I think we're more on the same page than you think. I don't just randomly give it out. But if I have a conversation and someone seems interested in it but unwilling to take the step to set up a wallet, I show them how easy it is. I know it has absolutely no effect on the value of bitcoin, introducing just one person. But I think it's a valuable ecosystem and am enthusiastic to help people understand it for their own benefit. :)
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:53:41
Why? I don't need one and neither does anyone else... if they want to lend money they can just send it to whomever they're lending it to. since the whole thing is based on trust, they just need to trust that the person is going to pay them back the principle and the agreed upon interested rate by an agreed upon date. what benefit does the app provide other than potentially taking some of my personal info and definitely taking a cut of the interest... None.. I'm sorry but as fun as this project sounds, I don't think it will be very useful

I agree completely, but if the ETF is not approved it will drop significantly before it starts that steady climb back up...

I disagree. I talk to people about it all the time and offer to give them $5 USD to buy some coin just to show them how easy it is. It's more valuable to help regular people join the community than it is to keep the $5 USD. This doesn't mean I don't value bitcoin. I definitely do.

When I started, I did like everyone else.. bought at highs and sold on selloffs all driven by emotion. I've learned well how to flip those natural reactions and have since done much better. Today's drop had me curious if there was something driving it but the thought to sell honestly didn't cross my mind. 
It *does* get easier my friend :)
@_date: 2017-03-09 03:05:32
oh ok, I was under the understanding that they (neither party) was allowed to extend it any longer. Good if they can though.. *well, better than denial

Ok, so I think I missed something, cause I have no idea where to find the paraphrase... I know bitcoin core doesn't use a mnemonic - where do I find the private key?
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:21:38
you can decide your fee if you run core... I never pay anything. I don't really care how long it takes to confirm. if I do, I throw a quarter in and it's usually done in 10 minutes..

@_date: 2017-03-06 18:45:58
Yeah, actually to be honest, they require "comments" from certain players such as Bats. They are also required to post them to the public. So the rest of the letters with the exception of certain people like the CEO of Circle and others, are probably not considered with much gravity if at all

hear me out on this question. I mean it genuinely.. Is it *possible* that both coins will retain their current value and people that own bitcoin before the fork will effectively double their money?

@_date: 2017-02-26 00:07:14
that makes no sense? if you spend anything on cloud mining you're basically buying bitcoin for less than it's worth...
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:25:45
I'm taking a total stab at this (so pleas someone correct me if I'm wrong) but once a block is solved and propagated to the network, the rest of the nodes would drop their current block they're working on, adopt the recently solved block as record, and the size of the block they were working on wouldn't matter. 
To those far more knowledgable than I, does this sound about right?

@_date: 2017-03-06 18:42:35
I like the article and he makes several good points, especially the one about how it would be better if the big money investors opened up a coinbase account and learned about bitcoin. while I agree, my thoughts on why the ETF is a good thins are as follows:
SEC approval would give credibility to the young currency. Yes, it would attract big money and inflate the price of the currency for no real reason other than a lot of money suddenly flowed in. But in addition it would attract the worlds eyes and smaller players would begin to really start to consider it as a viable form or transfer of value. This is where the big value lies.
In addition, with really large investors buying in to the ETF, this will create a stabilizer for the volatility. One person's vote will no longer equate to drastic drops and rises. Instead price will most likely increase significantly (neither good nor bad), remain quite volatile for some time (maybe 6 months to a year) but then should stabilize to a much less volatile level than we've seen. Bottom line is that the more players involved in bitcoin, the less volatile it will become. This is a fringe benefit of the ETF being approved.
All just my opinion though.  
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:10:06
I'll be confirming on the SEC site. Price is my second confirmation
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:41:22

other than signaling segwit, is there anything we can all do to help the process?
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:58:48
If someone owns 21 bitcoin they have 1/1,000,000th the amount of total coins that will ever be in circulation (but actually more because of lost coins, etc). So there are only 1 million people in the world who can have 21 coins or more...
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:58:17
On Feb 22 there was an amendment submitted that included a rule change from Bats and some other stuff. You can read through the amendment [here](
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:39:37
if you have any capital gains or losses (i.e. you don't buy from Gemini and sell to your friend at the "same" time), you can record it on Schedule-D (the form for financial gains such as dividends, cap gains from sale of stock/foreign currency, etc)
**Please not I'm not a registered accountant. As such I can't be held accountable for any incorrect information provided. Best to check with your accountant if you have any uncertainty

the results of it are not. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:28:27
Assuming there is no gain you're fine. I believe (don't quote me on this) that you have to declare yourself a transmitter of financial services and/or transactions if you deal over a certain amount of money (probably 2k or 10k). Someone might have to check me on this. But if you're doing just a few a year, you're probably ok.
@_date: 2017-03-03 19:23:25
I believe the announcement will be the 10th, am I wrong? the deal expires on the 11th which is a Saturday. they can't wait until the 13th to announce or it will default to approval
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:00:07
well, other than prosecuting etc... such details  :)
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:03:18
so if their prices are the same, you will literally have twice the value instantly? this can't be possible... if it is, it makes sense that BU supporters would want a hard fork, simply because they would profit enormously from it..

he talked about how the roulette screen was invented to show people the past hits so they knew it was random in an attempt to help them. but instead it caused them to develop convoluted strategies on what's hot/not based on history (when we all know that future hits depend not at all on past hits). 
The example was to show that giving the public more information doesn't always get the outcome it's intended.. It indeed was a great analogy in context, but completely unrelated to the BTC ETF

I'm not sure it's necessarily unlinked. Depends on the record keeping/security of the host miners I suppose. But yes your point is correct. That being said, there are plenty of exchanges on which you can buy bitcoin completely anonymously. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:39:23
not yet, since it's pretty big news I would expect they will keep it till the last ten minutes of the hour...
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:03:14
But wouldn't the total demand / market cap have to be equal to the sum of the two at least initially? The true demand isn't going to miraculously be twice as high nor would the market cap

Laced with LSD no doubt. Trippy stuff dude. Bitcoin is worth what it is selling for right now. That's what everything in the world is "worth". What someone is willing to pay for it right now.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:19:27
you can, but you can also blacklist any transactions coming from an account that received coin as a descendant of the original blacklisted account. this gets hairy though since eventually there would be millions of accounts from a single parent

@_date: 2017-03-03 19:20:14
I'm long. Not planning on selling at all. I have a high risk tolerance. I expect bit dips. This is ok. 
Most importantly, I never have to sell if in the future I can buy everything with bitcoin. 
It's not a game for me. I'm not trying to get rich. I trust that the currency will be mainstream enough to use like fiat is today. When that day comes the value of it will be so high because of large-scale adoption.
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:22:48
there are. in my opinion the in aggregate there is more reason to approve than deny. but that is just my opinion. I could be mistaken but I believe I've heard a soundbite on aantonop's opinion of the ETF and he basically said what others have said, if it's not approved now, it will be eventually. I would guess (or hope) that he finds it a good move if for no other reason than bringing some stability to the currency
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:57:41

@_date: 2017-03-14 01:23:08
if they pay you to buy it for them and you can document all of that with a paper trail, you're fine. but if you bought it and are selling it to them you technically have to declare capital gains on anything greater than what you purchased them for originally. I don't condone tax evasion but since it's such small amounts, you're probably fine not to worry about it. if you get audited, I doubt the IRS will care much about a few $250 transactions...

@_date: 2017-03-14 18:56:38
I think at some point, merchants will accept payments that aren't confirmed quickly as long as they witness that the transaction began. especially for small payments, the odds of someone double spending are incredibly low since there is no value in a double spend attack for such a small amount. in addition, prices of products will be priced to include any occurrence risk of a double spend and that customer walking off with an unpaid-for product... transaction fees should really only matter for very large purchases, in which case a few dollars or even $10, is relatively small anyway. still significantly smaller than a credit card fee or bank transfer, etc.

to be fair, Brexit caused a similar volatile reaction in the pound. it has since stabilized. bitcoin is doing the same..
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:59:04
hahahah too funny you said that... I took one look at it, read all the captions and closed the window - not because I was disinterested (I'm heavily interested in bitcoin).. - but because I'm a millennial and it was definitely a wall of text. I would recommend discretizing it a bit more, maybe into modules...
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:37:47
Right but that's exactly why it was 11 and not 20.. the pound is a world currency and Bitcoin is a small user base. That said, the stabilization so quickly speaks volumes to how much stronger Bitcoin is than people think

I'm sorry I don't mean to imply that. If anything I do believe that SegWit makes sense (which is why I'm signaling that through Core on my node), but I guess I don't understand BU well enough to see why it's as bad as the sub makes it sound. I thought it was more of "two different options" with segwit being the better choice, but a lot of the posts make it sound like BU is the end of the world of bitcoin. 
Is it because of the hard fork that would come out of it? Because if that's the main reason, I would agree - I'm opposed to anything that will create a hard fork. Just wanted to find out if there are additional additional negatives 
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:11:31
No offense to this guy but he offers no insight into what bitcoin brings to individual units of technology and/or how that will benefit their usability/value to customers. Could OP provide an example of such an idea?

thanks .. ill keep trying. I really appreciate you doing that. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:52:14
if this is the case (assuming it is), doesn't that just mean that after the hard fork, BTU goes to zero and BTC goes back to where it was and higher because it doesn't have the contentiousness tied to it any longer?

I appreciate your sentiment. I also know that I've only had my contracts for a little less than a year. Yes other cloud mining has burned many people and quite literally turned out to be a scam (hash ocean) but I also know that there are a lot of people who bought in to genesis a long time ago and the company is still around. it seems possible that some of those people may have broken even by now. Yes though, I agree using your logic, if it's always a scam then no one will have made back their initial investment (or opportunity cost of not buying bitcoins straight out). I was just trying to see if there was any hope for me with my genesis account since I still have it. Please understand I treat reddit respectfully and don't troll. I only ask questions when I truly have an interest in the answer..

if you know before the masses, you can profit. either way the decision goes..
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:33:25
Yep, which is exactly why I bough originally.. what I didn't factor into the equation was the exponentially rising mining difficulty rate. Basically if your rate of return was linear (ish) like in your example, you can turn it into pretty much a log function with diminishing returns. Based on the history of my mining payments (which started out at around $35USD per day (adjusted for halving, so really $70USD/day) and are now at about $7/day) I calculated that even over the next five years I can only hope to break even in terms of my BTC base that I spent on the mining contracts. Basically this means if I had instead bought bitcoin with that same USD in the beginning, I would be better off even if the price hadn't risen at all because over the next 5 years (6 years of total mining) I still don't expect to get back in bitcoin what I could have purchased.
In addition to this there are going to be more halvings, which will decrease the amount of bitcoin earned each day. You also have to trust that the cloud mining company is legit and doesn't run away with your money (which happened to me with one company early on - lost $900)
The price rising has meant I've broken even and even made a profit HOWEVER, I would have been FAR better off buying just the bitcoin from the start and hodling it rather than mining. You also have the risk that bitcoin drops in value and that you now have a contract to mine bitcoins that are not worth as much but you can't just sell and get out like you could if you had the actual coins.
Overall I don't recommend cloud mining. It's fun to see the little bits of bitcoin come into my account every day but I would have done better staying away from it. I feel like I had one other thought on the matter but I cant remember it right now and I'm at risk of rambling anyway. If you have more questions definitely reach out, I'm happy to answer. If you do chose to go with Genesis though, feel free to use my promo code (I get 2% referral or something of the GH/s that you buy so every little bit helps!)
Good luck

@_date: 2017-03-10 14:17:37
if I thought there was huge upside, I might put in a buy order for +8% or so to try and catch it on the way up before the big spike... 8% being roughly higher than just reg trading. I wonder if that triggered people with buy orders... ? just a bad theory
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:12:24
Agree, but I'd actual argue that that's the problem. We live in a first world country, which has unfortunately created an inflated sense of intellect (which is really just ignorance) and a disgusting sense of superiority (which America certainly is not).
All this "we're better than the world" crap is a dangerous mindset

@_date: 2017-03-13 23:55:06
haha im amused that I'm having a hard time grasping this concept. (I'm a financial analyst and economist) 
I sort of get what you're saying. it just seems that the value is directly tied to demand and when the hard fork happens, you would either have twice the "number of coins" all equal to half the value of the current BTC price OR the same number of coins at the same current value. 
Maybe would you be able to provide an example in USD fiat terms? I know a fork isn't really possible but what would be the equivalent?
@_date: 2019-03-18 01:51:45

I would agree with you if this was a stock or other financial investment - you cant predict the tops... but we can all agree that bitcoin will quite literally do nothing but increase (however volatily) for the foreseeable future. THAT is why no one should ever sell (if they are of the mind that fiat is the best choice for the future that is..) (which it's not)...

Respectfully, a year of trading success is by no means indication that success will continue. Many analyses have shown that in bitcoin in particular, buying after large dips and holding is the most profitable “strategy”
Bigger picture though, in the end you won’t have to sell, so just hold

I bought in to genesis about a year and a half ago. you can't measure your return in USD since the price of BTC fluctuates. If I had bought BTC outright I would have been able to buy 8 coins. So far (a year and a half later) I've only made back a little over 5 and my return drops exponentially every few weeks. I've run the math and by the end of my life (assuming I'm lucky enough to live quite a while longer and that genesis continues to pay the tiny fractions of a coin payouts to me) I will only end up making just shy of 7 coins. TLDR: not worth it. Buy BTC outright with the money instead
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:38:27
agree with r/staggerer.. w?
top of what? 
bitcoin had a long way to go, it's just a matter of how far out into the future you'd like to look
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:43:02
it would all depend on what base you want to start with. if you just look at the last year, it has increased an "average" of 0.6% compounded daily since the beginning of the year. Note: I say "average" because mathematically you can't really average compounding interest. But if you started with $1,000 on Jan 1st and compounded it at 0.6% every day you would get to about $5,000 by today (which is where we're at now) *These are rough numbers..
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:02:42

The whole point of the question was asking how if we switch to a bitcoin world without cash, how will we accomplish the things that cash works well for today, like transactions without power/internet.
Some users had good suggestions like physical bitcoins (open some etc) that could be used in such cases..
@_date: 2019-08-30 01:44:03
No but you can use cash..
@_date: 2019-08-22 00:50:15
Not anonymous and probably shouldn’t be thought of as an investment

Yeah but aggregate quality of life has gone way up..  all this stuff is so messy
@_date: 2019-08-30 12:49:47
I don’t fully agree. I would accept physical Casacious coins for payment. They don’t touch the internet at all when transacted. This is a potential solution to the problem of offline usability
@_date: 2019-08-30 01:55:40
Sure of course, but the point is more about how they would do it without access to the internet or a smart phone, laptop or any other first world technology
@_date: 2019-08-30 01:48:21
So, if you imagine a world in which cash becomes worthless and is no longer used, how Would you solve situations like these where cash really is the better option?

Haha this was my first thought and I went down this path with her until I realized that again you need the internet to verify the funds or you have to rely on trust, in which case you don’t need bitcoin anymore

All great points, thank you!
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:16:46
They are exactly that. I guess what I’m saying is, Casascoius coins are a method for using bitcoin without any chain interaction. I wonder if there are ways to probably mint similar mediums to where the bearer knows the amount is sound and can just hand it to the next bearer off chain

@_date: 2019-08-30 12:50:54
Yes, so the question is still relevant, what would we do when we are unable to scan a QR code or swipe a credit card if we don’t have paper money to fall back on?

@_date: 2019-10-14 15:37:04
Thanks again for your help. I was able to update my program and it will now successfully pull all inputs and ouputs and calculate the mining fees. I only have one minor issue and I'm not sure what's causing it. When I sum up all inputs OR all outputs, even though they are each displayed in BTC divisible to the correct number of decimals down to the satoshi, for some reason the total includes a reallllly small extra amount.   
For example if the input list is:
The sum I get is 0.5349940500007
What would be causing that extra 0.0000000000007 to show up?? I'm so confused. Even extracting them into excel and summing them, I don't get this "dust" showing up. Any ideas?
@_date: 2019-10-14 22:23:41
Awesome, thanks a bunch!

to be honest, if you're buying it with the intent of multiplying your money and don't know much else about it other than that, I don't recommend it. My suggestion would be to buy a little and learn more about what bitcoin really is. if you like it, sell more pounds. if not, just keep learning until you get why in the end, you won't have to convert back to pounds :)
@_date: 2019-06-24 21:56:25
Why keep working for them then?
@_date: 2019-10-13 19:03:26
Cool, I was able to pull the value from the previous input transaction (is the correct terminology the vout value of the UTXO?)
My only hangup now is that the output when I pull it is 
How can I extract the actual value from that string? Would the best way be to just strip the string of "Decimal('"      and      "')" and convert the resulting string to a float?

@_date: 2019-06-24 19:40:09
The difference is, unless you extort someone for physical cash, it’s very easy to track them down once the transfer is complete, and even with physical cash in most cases). With bitcoin, it’s pretty easy to make off without anyone ever figuring out who you are.. it’s a slightly modified (enhanced?) attack vector for extortion
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:31:05
The first point isn’t exactly true. You can just resend with a higher fee as long as it hasn’t been confirmed yet
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:56:49

Everyone saying to move to a hard wallet, etc.. it depends on your technical abilities and risk need. Self-custodian(ing?) only makes sense if you have sound technical knowledge of what you’re doing. The risks shift from the exchange being hacked, etc, to confidence in your own ability to keep your funds safe.  For small amounts, an exchange is just fine and likely less risky thank moving to a hard wallet on your own if you’re unfamiliar with important considerations. Places like Square and Coinbase, who are publicly traded corporations and who insure your position with the federal government (like a bank) are also less risky than a decentralized exchange or other lesser known platforms..
Just my two cents
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:42:58
Yep! Haha

PSA just don't buy more than you can afford to lose or stomach watching go down by 90%+. This is bitcoin. The price can and will make these moves again
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:28:48
sellers should wait for 6  confirmations. if the product is big (i.e. real estate) then a larger fee will confirm the txn more quickly. If it's coffee, then that's a risk you are willing to take if you don't wait for confirmations..

buy bitcoin instead. I bought a contract a year and a half ago and just plotted the returns over time (as they get logarithmically smaller each day) and I figured out that by the end of my life I will only have made back 85% of the coins I could have bought if I just bought them outright. And my contract was with the most reputable mining company out there (Genesis)

I wouldn’t be selling 50k calls on bitcoin with a strike a year out.. I’m not certain the price won’t be wildly higher than 50k a year from now. If it is, I’d be forced to sell my position for less than market. Not something I’d be willing to do given the (small) odds that it’s over 50k a year from now.

you pay taxes to the government in USD (or your respective country's currency). It's similar to exchanging one piece of real estate for another after having made a profit on the first. Though you "currency" is property, you still pay the government on the capital gains from the value increase of the first property

No one can accurately predict the short term in bitcoin. If they say they can, turn around and walk away. One in a thousand monkeys can flip 100 heads in a row. Doesn’t mean he knows how to call the coin.

depends on where you put them. if you put them in a wallet that you have the private keys for then yes you will also have bcash and bitcoin gold if you had the bitcoin before the split
look up wallet splitters. be careful though. it's easy to lose your original bitcoin splitting out the forked coins if you don't know what you're doing

On mobile now but if you go to their Twitter they post the amount of capital held in bitcoin pretty much every other day and it keeps going up (by a larger percentage than bitcoin is increasing in value). If you do the math it’s somewhere between 70mil - 120mil every few days or so

That's the case in the beginning. That's how the internet was. Businesses scoffed at the thought of a website being "essential" to their competitive success. Now it's the first thing a company builds after deciding on a name. Email was the same way. Bitcoin is separation of Money and State; something the world desperately needs, especially in a globalizing economy. Bitcoin is the first viable solution to that problem. As more people realize that, the greater adoption becomes and the more necessary it is for others to join the system

It’s still in its infancy. The value to fiat will continue in an uptrend most likely along a receding log function curve until it reaches maximum adoption. Then it will remain very stable. I would expect this could take 20 years or so if it happens

To be fair, there's nothing wrong with forking the code and changing the parameters to what you see as "best". The issue is that people vote by supporting the chain whose protocol they agree with. In this situation, big money has given itself an advantage. I see this whole thing as an unfortunate opportunity of the system being still so small. It's still *relatively cheep for a small collective to persuade or even stronghand the adoption of a chain they think is best. Couple this with new adopters having no clue what is going on, it's an opportunity to swindle people into something that would have otherwise not been the consensus protocol.
Just my thoughts.

@_date: 2017-11-26 12:34:04
It’s worth what it buys you in terms of real goods and services. Ask yourself what a dollar is worth today without respect to other currencies. It’s worth is just what it is able to purchase for you. This will happen to bitcoin after enough people have adopted it and it becomes a world currency 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:38:30
Because these are currencies, the "value" doesn't really matter. It's more the utility proposition that should determine whether you hold the tokens or not. Word to the wise, 99.99999% of all cryptocurrencies are scams or have no value proposition, they are just baiting "investors" to try to get rich quickly. 
Because you can buy small amounts of bitcoin, it is still easy to buy into with small amounts of money.

The volatility has been dropping since launch. It is a currency in the sense that it is used and accepted by people in exchange for goods and services and is a store of value. I apologize but I'm not sure what freakout you're referring to

"So, if you’ve held stock for 19 years, then you become a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico for one year, only 5% of your gain on sale gets the benefit of the 0% capital gain rate. You have to pay regular US capital gain tax on the rest. If you stay in Puerto Rico for another twenty years (and Act 22 sticks around), you’ll only get the 0% rate on 50% of your gain."

hashrate doesn't determine value though. if just two people believe in it and there is at least one miner, the chain will continue to exist and the value can still reflect what a small minority of people are willing to pay for it...

Untrue. Economic swings are caused due to the lag in the ability to price things in different currencies and those currencies fluctuating in purchasing power. If there is literally one world currency, the inflation/deflation schedule will not make any difference because it will be known 100% in advance and prices can adjust for this inflation/deflation as it happens (not possible in today's world). 


This is the byproduct of (and exactly what I'm referencing in the previous comment about multiple currencies) multiple currencies and exchanging one for another. The rate of exchange for BTC to USD today is NOT equal to the purchasing power changes in each - a much harder thing to deduce *because of the fact* that there are multiple currencies in the market.
The main point is that we don't know the value of centralized currencies because the central entity tells us what they are - we derive it from sampling its purchasing power. Unfortunately in a multi currency system, this is difficult to do and is lagging calculation. In a single currency world, this can be done instantly all the time

google replay protection. If you try to send coins from one chain it could result in them being sent on the other as well. so if you try to sell your "new coins" for $200/piece but end up losing your $6000 coins in the process, you're screwed.
also, keeping them on exchange means they are not your coins, they are the exchanges unless you hold the private keys. at any time the exchange can decide (or claim) that something didn't work and they "lost" your money.

not at all. they can say they are, but that's not a headache I would want to go through. bankruptcy is so much easier. 
and yes they can follow different protocols but that doesn't matter. whether you have access or not is up to the exchange if you have your money on it

@_date: 2017-10-20 15:49:31
a fork is just when people running nodes go by different protocols (that have a shared history until the new protocol version is run). forks aren't bad, they just represent different people's opinions on how the network should run. 
@_date: 2019-09-29 21:32:39
Not sure where you’re coming from with some of this. You can certainly have a decentralized inflationary cryptocurrency.. 
Also, the “price” of a decentralized currency is measured in purchasing power, so it’s value can be known. It’s like saying, what is a US dollar worth? As much as it’s purchasing power in real goods and services. Same with a decentralized currency. You don’t need a central bank to tell you how valuable anything is

got it, so it's because the funds being borrowed are sorta regulated by poloniex in that they can only be used for a margin position (not, say for example, to buy something on OpenBazzar). Is this correct?
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:03:15
in his suggestion, the scaling is based on blocknumber, but doesn't take into account the economic situation. if there are sufficient users (or transactions rather) then this is probably a decent approach, but if there are far fewer transactions, it allows for easier spamming of the network since fees are lower.
to be honest it just depends on what the community wants to use bitcoin for. if it's value is in acting as a store of value (think swiss bank) then no block increases may ever be needed. if on the other hand the community wants to use it for mass payment transfers (think Visa) then block size becomes an issue. 
I guess that's just a long way of saying that the scaling function satoshi proposes above only relies on the amount of time that has passed but doesn't take into account the state of the economy, which matters with respect to block size

I've been monitoring the loan rates and they don't seem to be very accurate in terms of representing actual risk quite yet... there are big swings (0.75% - 0.009% being lowest offered) even throughout the day... I guess this is a liquidity issue?
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:15:13
if competing groups don't come to a consensus, the network effects are lost and the whole system fails to work. in the case of bitcoin, the lack of consensus leads to a lack of confidence in the system by the users, which results in value-dropping coins (which is very apparent in the environment right now)

Vitalik is cumulocircumniscient. According to the theory of cyberastrological disotimization and the combined effect when it's interlaced with the benzatious theorem, it's clear that Craig Wright is not Satoshi. But Vitalik chose to explain it the easy way. Signaling theory.. BAH, child's play
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:10:04
yes, it is, but it already satisfies that definition and would continue to satisfy it whether blocks are increased or not. what changes is the way the money is used (i.e. store of value or liquid form of transactability).. that second part is what the community has to decide on. 
Edit: or maybe a different way to put it is that second one will be the outcome of how the community chooses to handle the block size debate

Agreed. Don't listen to naysayers. You keep doing what you think is best.

also, curious, why would someone borrow bitcoin for two days ?  what sort of things would they use it for? where are they getting the additional bitcoin to repay the interest ?
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:25:54
Cool thanks. So linearly meaning if I set my contract at .5% for 2 days on 100 Bitcoin, I would receive .5 Bitcoin the first day and .5 Bitcoin the second day for a total of 1bitcoin, correct?
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:23:08
ah ok. I apologize for my terse response. In a nutshell, only so many transactions can be included in each block (each one is built roughly every 10 minutes and house all the transactions that need to be confirmed). right now traffic is so high that it's putting constraints on transaction processing time. txns with higher fees are included with priority. 
Segwit is one proposed solution to the scalability debate (please search these subs for more info, too long to explain at a high level and gets a little technical). if it is widely enough adopted, it will allow more txns to be included in each block
does that help a little?

thanks. just to be clear I'm not saying patterns don;'t exist, I'm just saying that applying math in any way to a currency that is incentivized by social scalability (something that has never existed before) cannot be applied the same way analysts try to apply it to equity backed securities..

And sometimes it takes losing money to better understand something. It's better to try and lose than to not try at all. Besides, it sounds like this kid is mining pennies and on a computer none the less. The costs are low and the risk is low.. What can it hurt to let them experiment and figure out what actually works and doesn't. Advice is good but discouragement isn't

@_date: 2017-07-13 18:36:52
Yeah I just reread my question and I think it's poorly worded (my bad). What I'm asking is, is there a site where someone who is interested can check what the data size of a file would be at any instant in time (over time) that is comprised of all addresses that have unspent transactions. so for example today, there are X million addresses with &gt; 0 UTXOs.. if I were to compile them into a document, how big would the file be. I think your first answer kind of alludes to this, however, if I were then interested in seeing how this changed over time since block 1, is there somewhere that has this information already available?

Doesn’t look too strange. Shorts getting liquidated at key levels, price goes up, some people take profits.. nothing too crazy
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:56:46
the only thing you can say for sure is that there will be people who don't set up sound systems for passing on their coins or who do not have an inheritance plan. those coins will likely be lost forever. what that means for the price is not really much. the market will only react to lost coins if they know they're lost and even then, small amounts won't affect price very much. Over a long enough time frame though, it will mean a decrease in supply. if we assume demand reaches a leveling out point, simple economics would say the price will continue to rise slightly over time due to this fact. ceteris paribus (assuming all other things equal)
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:41:46
It’s definitely possible if it takes market share  from world currencies and gold/other similar store of value investments

is there any security guaranteeing that the private key isn't housed somewhere else (e.g. in the hands of the manufacturer)?
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:58:55
Irrelevant. Everything is "priced" in both, one is just advertised and not the other. The good or service is constant, the actual value you trade, whether in dollars or coins, is what fluctuates. The goal is to trade as little value for the good as possible.

to be fair, it's not immutable, it's just infinitesimally unlikely... statistically speaking.. ok I'll just go ahead and down vote myself...
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:57:39
well gosh, that's kind of strange... so I guess theoretically if no other node clients pick up the transaction and add it to the mempool, since core won't let you spend a pending txn, you can technically lose coins that way I suppose? Obv very unlikely since 72 hours is a long time and SOME other node will pick it up and maintain propagation, but still kind of a strange move by the core team..
anyway, thanks again for the info and charts
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:51:16
ah ok. yeah I understand the client/wallet protocol stuff. Core is the client I use. I use their wallet service blah blah. But so you're saying my core client won't broadcast the transaction anymore since it's so old... it's still in the mempool though so eventually it will get picked up (prolly around fork day) right? 
also, if you have a resource for further reading on bumping the txn, id love to read more about it. Def not worth it for this particular txn but good info to know.

an oracle is just an external off chain feed (or source of information) from the real world to a smart contract. For example if I had a contract that would execute if Apple stock hits $X/share, I might use Yahoo finance stock ticker feed as my oracle (which is not a good idea because it is a single source and vulnerable to bad actor manipulation etc so maybe a better idea would be to average many ticker service feeds, etc)... the feed in this case is the oracle. 
Another example might be, if I have a smart contract set to bequeath my estate to my beneficiaries upon death, the coroner's office might be designated the oracle to sign and upload their authority that I have in fact died... there are security bugs in this system as well but you get the idea..
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:02:10
and this summer is most likely the result of more mass media coverage in a (relatively) positive tone causing the slight acceleration. my guess is that once the newcomers decide to cash out we'll see a small correction (maybe what's going on now) and then that slow and steady growth will continue until the next major wave of adoption all at once... all of the numbers make sense. 
TLDR - yep, use LOG scale

if you price in bitcoin, the US dollar fluctuates just as much RELATIVE to bitcoin. so it just matters which perspective you want to take. i.e. if you hold bitcoin and it goes up, everything becomes "cheeper" in the real world (relative to USD). the converse is also true. If you hold USD and bitcoin goes up, everything becomes "more expensive" in the real world (this time, relative to bitcoin)
