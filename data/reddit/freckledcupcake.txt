Congrats! We started taking a long while back, and it's been nothing but great for us too!

aww, thanks!  Glad you enjoyed it!

yes, we use bitpay at our cupcake shop.  Works great.
@_date: 2013-03-16 19:39:11
We have a payment option on the website - people can pay their invoices (we send them, and they can pay through intuit (online), or they can go on our website and pay with bitpay.

Scroll to the bottom of the front page for the link to pay with bitcoin.

YES!  I love Nara!  It's my favorite sushi place in the city - cheap, and GOOD.

ours is actually on a mount, and we swivel it.  I've been looking at other ones - they are, indeed, pricey.

In SF, the paybyphone system charges a 45 cent fee for each time you send them money, which covers any fee the city might be charged.

aww, thanks!  We'd love a Yelp review, if you can!

Yes, the transaction is a little clunky, but not **much** worse than any other payment method.  
Ideally, I would love to have Bitcoin integrated with Square (our register system), but that isn't going to happen (certainly not anytime soon).  Right now our process is to ring up the customer through Square to get the total, then switch to BitPay to process the payment.  We then cancel out the transaction in Square.  It seems to be the least-clunky way to do the transaction.  
Using Square online payments, it takes a minute for the customer to open the square app and authorize the payment.  After that, it finishes quickly.
Until there's a Bitcoin payment integrated into other standard register apps, the transactions will be a little clunky.

The city is probably charged 1-2% fee for credit cards, considering the sheer quantity of money coming through them, along with a 29 cent (or less) transaction fee.  Considering their average transaction is under $5, that 40 cent fee probably covers the whole processing fee.

bummer!  CBS (local station) will also be stopping by on Thursday, I think?  I'll repost again when I know the time.

We have it on our website, but mostly its through bitcoin media.  We're one of the few retail stores to accept it, so people seek it out.

We made the video when we started taking Bitcoin (maybe a couple weeks after?).  It's been mostly a random trickle.  The reason I started accepting it (other than my husband's insistence) is that people who use Bitcoin want to spend it on things, especially at a real store.  People will go out of their way to spend Bitcoin, so it's a great addition to the business for us.

I use Square as a general CC processor - my rate is 2.75% flat - bit pay isn't much of a bonus for us.

She stopped by my cupcake shop to buy cupcakes (with bitcoin) yesterday - she mentioned how difficult a week it's been, but it's been interesting, for sure.

I didn't mean to worry people!  I mostly meant to warn them - Apple started disabling Bitcoin apps (or taking them off the app store, at least!)

Yes, but if you want to use bitcoin, you have to convince merchants to take it.
