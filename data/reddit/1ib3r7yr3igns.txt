If the transaction didn't hit the block chain, then it didn't go through. You still have the funds associated with your address, and whatever the issue is, once resolved, you will still have those funds.

I know you don't want to hear it, but this sounds exactly like an issue with the transaction never getting picked up into a block because the fee wasn't high enough to be picked up in a block. Bitpay has nothing to do with that if the fee is set too low, nor is there much they can do to force the miners to include the transaction. All bitpay can do is broadcast the tx, which they did, and it seems was never included in a block for whatever congestion reason there is on the network. I saw in one of those github issues, the user had a fee of 100 sat/byte. I made a transaction around the same time and I paid ~300 sat/byte for it. Perhaps your fee was too low. The bitpay wallet can keep track of transactions that it has broadcast, that is why it is showing a lower balance, but if it hasn't been included in a block, then the transaction was never sent, and the original address still contains the funds.

Not with a $15 fee, they won't. There is no self interest there.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:19:34
That is a really dumb argument. I wouldn't doubt a central banker made it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:46:06
Strange that you left blockstream off of that list.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:48:48
Hey don't talk to me. I don't work there.
Truth is, bitpay's software was written in a time where fees and confirmation times were negligible, bitcoin was never supposed to have large fees nor long confirmation times. Sure, they should update the software with this new dynamic, but they themselves won't know what to update without user input.
I see this as more of a problem with the network than the wallet.

If bitcoin core didn't want their code copied, perhaps they wouldn't have released it with an MIT License.

Wait seriously? Mazacoin is still out there!!
I always wondered how that one was doing. I wonder if the Cheyenne-Arapahoe tribal council uses it at all.
Do you have a link to this site?

Really though, what is bitpay doing wrong in this instance?
The bitcoin next block fees are &gt;$2.00. So that’s what they’re charging for transactions.
Bitpay is there offering the service to use bitcoin. What are they doing wrong here for nothing more than allowing their clients to use bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-05 04:41:58
This isn’t bitpay, it’s the bitcoin network. Bitpay is an _instant_ payment processor. Meaning they’ll try and get your transaction into the next block. To do this on the bitcoin network, mining fees are &gt;$2.00. On bitcoin cash, the next block fee is &lt;$0.01. This isn’t bitpay taking your money as a profit to themselves, it’s next block mining fees to use bitcoin.

Yes, I was around back then. Stories like this were quite common. I wouldn't even have gotten involved if I thought poor people were going to be systematically excluded from using the network.
@_date: 2019-06-05 05:20:47
Well, you gotta understand that developer hours are expensive. Putting 10 devs on lighting integration for 2 months could easily cost a company over $350,000 in developer salary. Include QA and the company could be in $500,000 just to integrate the lightning network.
Lightning is still advertised as beta, there are fundamental liquidity and routing issues to it. Companies cannot be expected to invest that kind of capital on beta services.
Are you running a lightning node?

Seriously dude, the real attack on cryptocurrency is to try and divide and conquer the community.
I see you’ve taken that bait, hook, line and sinker.
How long have you been using bitcoin if you don’t mind me asking?
@_date: 2019-06-05 05:57:06
Some people cannot afford to make the fees worth it. It’s not necessarily their fault that they don’t have hundreds of dollars to invest all at once to make the fees worth it. Many people can only afford to start with baby steps.
$2.00 fees forces an exclusion of those that cannot afford $2.00. OP is complaining about a $15 purchase. Imagine those around the world that trade a days worth of labor for $2.00. There’s no chance they have to get on-boarded with bitcoin if it has fees like that.
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:14:15
BS they weren’t. They absolutely were.
@_date: 2019-06-05 06:11:23
That’s not true.
Look at the bitcoin fees. 
$2.00+ is next block fees. If they’re taking extra on top of the mining fees, it’s viewable on the blockchain. Is there an example tx to show that bitpay is taking more, beyond the mining fees?
Even if they were, it would be cents in dollar terms, which makes it non-economic for bitpay to do since they’ll have to pay mining fees when they eventually spend those satoshis.
@_date: 2019-06-05 06:26:15
Show me an example on the blockchain where bitpay is taking more than the miner fee.
Not everyone has the experience to construct their own tx and dictate their own fees. That’s why companies like bitpay exist. To construct txs for those with less experience. They advertise their txs as instant. To do that, they need to charge next block fees as dictated by the network. It’s out of their control.
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:07:19
That’s absurd. You need more than two devs to know how the integration works. What if they leave? Then you are stuck as a company with code no one understands.
1 QA? Sounds like a recipe for a bug that could cost the company a massive amount if exploited.
@_date: 2019-05-31 18:18:52
It wasn’t an attack. The network congestion was a serious problem. An increase to tx throughput was urgently needed to accommodate demand. Late 2017 was an absolute disaster for BTC. I personally spent $500 in mining fees on a single transaction to myself when I consolidated my old mining address. Countless people were trying to use BTC but were turned away due to congestion.

There's nothing wrong with him. He's an innovator and visionary. He didn't want the Bitcoin community to split in 2017, so he supported a compromise.  
The comments here against him are absurd.

You don’t want to get a rogue version. That’s why you verify the checksums of your downloads and verify the pgp signatures.
But to be honest, if it’s a rogue version, wiping afterward probably won’t help.
But always verify your downloads.

Or just boot into a clean version of Tails.

This hatred of Erik Voorhees is absurd. He's done more to help bitcoin flourish than you will ever do.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:37:17
I don’t buy your argument for a second. It wasn’t an attack, whoever is telling you that is lying. There was a very real demand to scale throughput. I am case in point. That day in 2017 I spent $500 in network fees to move my own money was the first time in 4 years I ever regretted telling people about bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:52:33
Wow. Take it easy. Talk about shitting on the people that built the infrastructure you use today.
Why is the vitriol so prevalent here?
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:06:44
Search the address you sent it to on a block explorer.
Could be that it’s stuck in the mempool.

Tails boots into RAM. Wiping the disc wouldn’t remove anything because there’s nothing to remove.

Don’t put it in a bank deposit box. Banks will and have raided their safety deposit boxes when in crisis. The whole point of cryptocurrency is that banks are untrustworthy.
