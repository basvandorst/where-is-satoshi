Because we have an entire history to show that technology advances, it's an easy assumption to make
And again, the specific scenario being addressed here is "crypto takes over fiat" and that scenario, if it were to come to pass, inherently means OP's issues were dealt with.
To be really simple, OP is lashing out at people who talk about crypto beating fiat by pointing out all the obvious issues it has, but what OP missed was the fact when people talk about crypto beating fiat, it's understand that these issues will have been dealt with before that happens so OP's rant is all very. . . "duh"
Like obviously those are issues and people saying crypto will take over fiat are NOT suggesting it will do so BEFORE dealing with those issues
All of OP's statement is just "obvious stuff man, we're not ignoring that when we talk about a crypto future"

For profit banks are, yes. This is where the debate in usa is arising around socialism.
We're learning that maybe *some* industries shouldn't be ran for unlimited profit. Maybe *some* being regulated non-profit and the vast majority of industries left to private industry is better for us all (mixed economy)
Healthcare and banking come to mind right away of industries that need to be either ran entirely not for profit (healthcare) or have less profit motive to dick people over (banks)

That's the whole point of Bitcoin. You can't double it. There's a finite amount. You can't print more and it's immune to inflation and trackable. 
Asking why we cannot just double the total amount of Bitcoin is pretty silly and makes me wonder what you actually read about Bitcoin at all?

Hopefully tonight reassured you!

Loved OP's points but you make the better one.
OP has a list of valid concerns of the technology *at this moment in time* which for many goes against the idea of it taking over fiat, is the understood that *in the time it takes to take over fiat, it will have been improved to deal with a lot of these issues*
It would NOT take over fiat until it had been, therefore in a fantasy where it does, those issues have been solved.

Tldr, JUST MY OPINION NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, buy as much as you can as soon as you can before summer 2020 and don't think of selling before fall/winter 2020

Free market, people can accept Bitcoin for whatever they like. Doesn't mean they will or have to. 
Idk if we'd ever hit your hypothetical point though. The smallest amount of btc is VERY small, much smaller than a penny is to a dollar
The satoshi is currently the smallest unit of the bitcoin currency recorded on the block chain. It is a one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC). The unit has been named in collective homage to the original creator of Bitcoin, SatoshiNakamoto

You got it!
Only sell when you need the money to buy something serious that you cant afford through other means, making a 100% returns doesn't mean anything if that means you doubled $100 to $200, it has no real impact on your life for most people.

That's my plan. I'm fresh out of college post military with a new job providing nearly 100k in salary and benefits. 
Just going to treat btc like my 401k and invest a % of my pay every month until I retire. 
If it all comes crashing down, my salary, savings, and other investments keep me doing just fine
Best case scenario it takes off to the stratosphere and I retire early!
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:50:17
Investing it always a risk, that's why people make money. 
I tell people who are interested but can't afford large investing to throw twenty bucks in. If you have a job, you could save twenty bucks and make it happen. 
Once you have skin in the game, you're more likely to follow the price and learn more because you're invested, which puts you in a stronger position in the future when you can buy more
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:09:49
This right here!
If I sell now I recoup a couple thousand dollars which will not really affect my life very much
If I hold and it skyrockets I stand to make enough to have an impact on my life

You can see I didn't edit by the lack of *edited tag. 
All I was saying was people think they missed the rush but the 0-10k is a drop in the bucket compared to reaching 100k if you buy in now. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:44:29
Honestly? It just got popular first and is in the main stream. It's code is open source so many alt coins DO improve on Bitcoin. 
Ethereum and litecoin are worth watching as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:41
That's called timing the market and is a great way to sell now and watch as it soars to 20k, 25k, etc. No one can predict the market, its best to hold.
Plenty of threads here of people who sold on a spike only to have to rebuy in later at a higher price.
But if you can predict the future, go for it

And one penny increasing to $1 is 100 times, what are you going on about, who cares about that?
Were talking about sheer value here

11k thread?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:44:27
Why would prices drop when demand goes up as more people enter the market buying?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:26:01
Bitcoin as an idea and what it stands for is why it will survive. Tulips didn't have that going for them. ��

Two weeks ago, Google, it was huge news

0-10k is a drop in the bucket compared to 10-100k :)

Raiblocks xrb. It's amazing. It actually gained during this dip.

You just put how much you want to spend and you get an appropriate amount of btc at current prices when buying on coinbase
You don't have to buy by placing an order for X amount of Bitcoin.

It's free to transfer to gdax and withdraw free from there. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:18:39
0-12k is a tenth of 12k-120k
Stay in it for the long term because you believe in the idea.
Millions of others believe, too.

Block chain is one long ledger with every transaction being appended to the end one after the other
Bitcoin sucks. That's the real story. It has first movers advantage and gets props for that, but it wasn't designed to handle this high amount of transactions
How do you get your transaction on the block chain when millions of others want to as well? While also preventing malicious or pointless transactions? 
The miners charge fees. The more transactions backup, the higher fees miners require to crack the code that outs your transaction on the block chain
Some exchanges eat the fees for you, others don't. 
Some processes are in works to fix these Bitcoin issues but other coins already solved the problems thanks to coming second and making smart changed to the code before going live
Bitcoin will fall eventually to better tech. The first automobile didn't survive either. It'll limp along for a while helping crypto break into the mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:21:09
You already don't have to buy a whole coin lol. This makes no sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:46:58
It's likely in a future where we are all paid in and conduct business with cryptocurrency and the government is no longer in the business of printing and backing paper money

Knowing the exact date is huge. It's what defines insider trading.

There are decentralized exchanges in the works! But for now crypto is not really crypto...yet
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:00:58
Best time to buy is always now. If you're going to hold anyway, would you rather buy at a dip and maybe save a few bucks, or miss a big Spike and lose out on even more?
Buy now and buy the dip later.

Whales do this all the time with other coins when they put up sell walls
Take a whole bunch of profit at an all-time high and then continue selling off in order to start a crash, stop selling and allow others to continue racing to the bottom and then rebuy at the bottom for future profits once it recovers
