Just looking at the charts, how on earth is it bullish?
That was a serious question, but Downvotes work too
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:27:34
Umm, none of those charts ever reached their peak levels again
@_date: 2016-03-26 01:21:57
And yet you Bitcoin guys don't understand why the rest of the world doesn't understand how great it is
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:49:58
Are you kidding? We measure things in percent because if you own something that's how much the value of the piece that you own went up or down. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:36:28
Lol the dollar? Yeah? The max percentage swings are like 2.5%, and those are pretty rare.
Guess I don't see your point. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:07:13
If anyone here ever wonders why Bitcoin won't ever replace other top currencies this is a really good example

A few things regarding his first 3 points that I don't really understand. 
1) he claims Bitcoin is more stable than ever. Ok, well that's great, except it really isn't compared to a actual currency like the usd. Last October it rallied 100% and then promptly turned around and fell 40%. This happened in less than 2 weeks
2) he claims the global economy is unstable. I actually agree with him here, except putting your money in Bitcoin would still be gambling, as Bitcoin is anything but safe. Also if the economy collapses people will want to own the dollar, not Bitcoin, as the dollar won't fail. The dollar rallied in 08. 
3) if you look at the last year sure it looks good, because it conveniently fit the authors narrative. Look at the year before that and Bitcoin lost like 67%
So can anyone tell me why I would EVER use Bitcoin as a proxy currency with how unstable it is? I can understand investing it instead of a different risky asset, but that's all it would be, is a high risk high reward bet. That's not generally what you're looking for in a currency. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 14:29:50
I'm not extremely familiar in currency markets, but probably because Bitcoin has ridiculous swings on a daily basis, to the point where it doesn't really matter what you compare it to. 
For instance the pound fell like 12% from brexit last Friday and it made national news, it was on every news cycle multiple times over the day. Bitcoin fell 30% last week and nobody cared, because that's what it does. It's volatile as fuck. 
Why does that illustration matter? Because most currencies you would be looking at vs Bitcoin have 3% moves, not 30%. So your chart is going to be relatively the same with respect to the underlying because all the underlyings you're looking at behave closer to the same in terms of volatility. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 21:27:06
Yeah that was honestly my first thought too, I bet the dude has a lot of Bitcoin he needs to unload
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:40:00
I think you'd be surprised 
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:20:52
65% once combined for some people in New York. That's just asinine. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:23:07
Holy shit that was bad
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:09:27
Sorry it took me a minute to respond, I was reading through this to ensure it reflected my views, which it does. It doesn’t have lots of scary music and illustrations like that video does, but it has the benefit of being correct. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:29:54
Man fucking all of it. Ignoring and conflating different concepts and presenting the info in a misleading way in order to elicit a reaction, feeding on ignorance (ooo the big bad banks are *gambling* with your money), the “man” stealing all your hard earned dollars. I made it almost all the way through it before I had to choose gouging out my eyes with a pencil or turning it off. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:44:55
It does not, the treasury does. Which is counter to what the post seems to think. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:36:38
It expands the money supply. Depending on you definition of currency the answer could be yes or no. I think this is a good article on the subject 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:09:52
I think this article covered all of what was portrayed in the video. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:37:16
iirc it’s primarily from the overnight rates it charges, I don’t have time to look it up right now 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:13:24
Lol and you got that from a quick comment I made before heading into work this morning huh. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:02:13
Similarly, the type of people that are fanatical about bitcoin are also the type to have a monopoly level understanding of the fed!
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:26:57
The fed does not create paper dollars directly like the original post literally says. “The bank may issue new money on slips of ordinary paper”. That is not what the federal reserve does. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:29:57
That the video is trash? Yeah it actually did on multiple accounts. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:34:17
I see you watched that horrendous YouTube video the other guy posted too. And I was answering in relation to the original post, which is what my comment and I assumed the whole discussion was about. Didn’t realize it was some stupid gotcha question like how many fingers am I holding up (nope ones a thumb! Aren’t I clever!). 
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:47:36
That sounds sketchy as fuck

Myth  – The Fed operates against the interests of the US government and costs taxpayers money. 
The Federal Reserve System was created with the intention to provide a central clearinghouse for the nation’s banking system as well as a more coordinated regulatory framework for banking.  This system helps maintain a stable payments system and works in favor of stabilizing the US economy.  Further, the power of monetary policy is designed to give the central bank some policy control over the nation’s money to help achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.  As a whole, this is a public good even if it is not always perfectly managed and often gives the appearance of enriching banks.
At times, it is implied that the Fed is a financial burden on the nation, but the Fed does not cost the US taxpayer anything.  The stockholders of the Fed contribute paid in capital and the annual operations of the Fed are maintained by its own income.   In fact, **any excess profit the Fed earns is returned to the US taxpayer via the US Treasury (and by law, used to pay down federal debt or buy gold).  In 2012 this income was substantial and amounted to over $90B.  As a whole, the Fed is actually a substantial revenue source that the US government would not otherwise have.**

Fuckin lol

Would places that accepted bitcons also accept all other cryptocurrencies by default, or would they have to be set up for each specific currency?
