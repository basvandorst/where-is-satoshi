Exactly, I'm sure a shitty executive justified reddit gold as the only means of survival for reddit. Reddit should start its own cryptocurrency I think.

Hypothetically, if they create a "give BTC" option, maybe they'll take a 1\-3&amp; share for the service. That's how Mastercard and The Silk Road work. :P
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:19:59
Yeah, that is the simplest solution.
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:15:58
The thing is, reddit needs to earn some of the tip to keep running. I was thinking escrow, but it just makes bitcoins centralized.

This is the dystopia where the cypherpunks just give up in the end, out of laziness, LOLz
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:22:00
Oh wow, they let you have themes. Nice.

You can easily blame bad marketing among other things. The feature just needs to be adopted by a lot of redditors first, for example: the OP could just offer $10 for the best answer.

Dude, can you stop fucking with me and describe how lightning can be used for tipping?
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:27:10
Yeah this is my 2nd attempt and I'm starting to see that I don't get it. It is supposed to DM you that it has 100 bananos for you. It hasn't done that probably because I don't have 100 bans.
See if this works: [u/banano\_tipbot]( 10

Elaborate please! I think you mean the lightning network, but I still don't follow.
P.S. If you literally meant lightning then boooooooooooooooooo
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:13:19
This is heartbreaking. But we shouldn't stop trying. And yeah, if reddit team implements it, it should have the strongest chance.
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:02:27
I do not follow, elaborate please?
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:05:47
This is amazing, but I still down get who is actually paying the $0.25 per 100 coins now, the creators of banano?
Also, there is actually a chance that people will be able to cash out in some other currency one day?

This is excellent, but I don't like the idea of a third party bot i.e. not an accountable entity, unlike reddit doing the payments itself, then accountability would be much better, don't you think?
Should users just post their BTC public keys? I dunno. I like how u/meadowpoe suggested the lightning network.
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:08:41
Done. They all seem to be alike.
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:26:43
Googled, but couldn't find; link please?
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:10:03
Very articulate answer, cheers!

Noob here, don't know any economics.
can you tell me HOW TO ESTIMATE STABILITY FOR A CERTAIN MARKET CAP?
what other factors affect stability?
I'm damn sure you can lecture me for 100 hours on such a vast topic, please provide a link to a book or something. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:23:53
Yeah centralization is hopping in as usual, maybe just mention the public keys below the answer?
