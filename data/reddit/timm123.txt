Why can't they just split it from the large address directly down into the final sized addresses all in one transaction?

Splitting up large outputs.

No they didn't.
If you're talking about [this]( then that's coinbase re-jigging their funds

    \DB::DAO('Money_Bitcoin_Available_Output')-&gt;searchOne(array('Available' =&gt; 'Y', new \DB\Expr('`Value` &gt; 1000000000')));    
Looking at the code, looks like it will stop splitting at 10 BTC

Nice when's the next one?

Why can't they just split it from the original address? Why do they need to do it through a binary tree?

mmmm Bitcoin is founded on exactly the opposite...there is zero trust in the system, you can only trust yourself and your own node.
