Baby, I'm gonna go down on you like January BTC

A big enough sell order at once to satisfy the entire order book all the way down to 1k? 
I'd like to see the transaction history...that would be brutal for the seller. 
Or am I missing something?

At my country's exchange i pay 0.75% each way so I'd lose 1.5% just in the trade. 
In hindsight I could have done lots of things, but I'm more confident in dollar cost averaging and buying during relatively lower points, and less confident in my ability to time it each way and overcome the friction of fees.
I won't sell for a long while yet, and while I would hate to end up losing money I'm only putting on the line what I can do without.

I'll never leave my computer to have a shower again!  (...maybe I'll just set some low limit buys instead)
The good news is it has rescaled the chart and makes the last month look nice and smooth in comparison...
Can we look at the old data somehow to confirm if there was really transactions at this level or if it accidentally logged a BCH transaction or something instead?

Very nicely laid out, thanks for sharing

Yeah but the transfer times will be excellent

When it's down im worried, when it's up I'm annoyed that I'm not holding more, when it's sideways I'm waiting to see what I should be regretting.
Gonna keep holding and slowly adding to my position at a rate that lets me sleep and live my life without worrying about the price, but it is addictive in a way.
 I just want to see the coin become more accessible, can't wait until it is easy for everyone to use and store and understand how to handle it safely.

Ok cool, will wait and see if they correct the charts so that they display on a helpful scale again. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:23:28
I feel your pain

I think market manipulation and volatility promote speculative activity, which at the start helps to make Bitcoin a 'household name', but long term this activity prevents it from being used as intended and transitioning from one form to the other may prove very difficult.
If the brand of Bitcoin is forever linked with speculative risk then at least it has helped bring blockchain to the attention of many and spawned a whole new technology sector to fulfill many use cases than ever envisioned for the one coin that started it all.
