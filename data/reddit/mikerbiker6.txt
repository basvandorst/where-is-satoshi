If storj  is build on the bitcoin blockchain, why does it need a new currency? Can't they just pay out users in bitcoin?

Or he was forced to delete his data, and then got shot. But I believe theory 2.
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:10:10
so how does bitpay make money? Do they have a different exchange rate?
@_date: 2014-07-31 13:44:22


according to post:
until I reach a threshold of no more than 25-30% of my assets to be converted into BTC

People type lol for everything now, but I seriously lol'ed when reading your comment.
@_date: 2014-07-29 08:11:06
Just tell them you forgot the passphrase
@_date: 2014-07-02 14:16:53
Well, according to that reasoning gold is planetary too. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 21:55:21
Yep, bought in some more this week.
@_date: 2014-08-11 19:36:17
fk payza with their pointless fees.
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:57:12
Another problem: When I try to log in into my account (and I have 2FA enabled), it sometimes doesn't ask me for my authentication code.
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:08:05
you do know that those charity funds sell your bitcoin. So it is not a strict btc transaction.
@_date: 2014-07-30 11:14:13
A larger pool mines more coins on average but you get a smaller cut, so it doesn't matter which pool you're on. On a larger pool you just get paid more regularly.
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:12:53
use blockchain.info
@_date: 2014-08-01 09:34:41
Well, it's a start.
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:41:39
I read some truely ignorant comments there.
@_date: 2014-08-05 16:45:54
Lying and not telling the truth are 2 different things. Maybe the first employee had mis-interpreted information and was convinced it was bitcoins problem.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:39:44
Yes but the combined hashrate of one pool could be misused by a pool operator(this person could control the full hashrate of the miners on his pool).
@_date: 2014-06-28 21:55:53
me too, deleted it right away
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:29:18
You could also look at the remaining part, 70% invested in EUR must be very risky. What an exposure.
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:18:57
I can find mistakes in 30% of the ads corresponding to the items I order. I first contact the seller to hash it all out in a reasonable manner. If I don't get what I want, there is always the lap of paypal to go and cry on, haha.
@_date: 2014-08-01 09:37:46
what is the difference?
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:01:59
not everyone on the planet accepts bitcoin,so it is not yet planetary. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 10:34:18
I can rocket down too for no apparent reason.
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:33:57
It is actually a form of advertising. I have recieved these transactions too on my blockchain account but there was a little link to the a gambling website next to it. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:19:01
the ignorance is strong
@_date: 2014-07-09 11:36:27
nice demo video:
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:21:18
@_date: 2014-07-25 13:27:24
but you are insured if the ball gets stolen while protected... just saying
@_date: 2014-07-22 19:02:17
Newegg said they were going to ship to europe by the end of june, one month later still nothing.
@_date: 2014-06-26 22:46:11
I love to order stuff on ebay. When I recieve my product(s) I will search for days untill I find a mismatch with the advertisements, then get a chargeback. Most people don't make a hassle about it for small amounts and let you keep the item. This is totally legit since it is a mistake in the ad. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:49:36
Yeah, just cashed out my 40 grand. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 11:12:03
But aren't they refilling their hot wallet with bitcoins from your deposit address eventually?
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:43:47
Old news. Anyone with a brain could have predicted this a year ago.
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:10:35
isn't that from A to B and from B to C?
So it is linked.
Or from A to B and from C to D?
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:54:08
Which software is used to bundle these transactions? I am not looking to spam people, I am interested in sending coins to a bunch of customers at once.
@_date: 2014-06-29 17:09:43
how will the exchange make money without fees?
@_date: 2014-06-27 16:10:38
Misread the title, (and the article lol).
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:52:37
I got this 2 months back. I have 2FA enabled to be safe.
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:37:51
No break even in sight.
@_date: 2014-06-22 08:57:10
bitmain is starting to crack
@_date: 2014-08-05 20:11:24
@_date: 2014-07-26 11:17:36
Are you looking for a US bank?
@_date: 2014-08-05 16:33:53
I believe it does. Then there would be a link between B and C, and therefore between A and D.
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:07:33
at least accept bitcoin donations in the video description.
