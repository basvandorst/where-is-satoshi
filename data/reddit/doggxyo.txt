the real MVP here - thanks! I don't have an account and couldn't read more than the first few lines.

+1 for coinbase. Took me like 10 minutes from setup to walking away with a bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-01-24 04:34:12
Oh! That was definitely the part I was missing. Totally makes sense to me now, thank you so much for your explanation - much appreciated!

i know this post is getting old - but do you mind sharing what happened? I am stuck at 200/week and in the limits page, it looks like the only way to increase is to purchase $1800 more of btc (which sucks at 200 bucks at a time)
@_date: 2016-01-24 03:29:55
yeah I guess my main limitation that is my concern is of instant buy. I can buy 200 instantly per week, but anything higher than that - I have to wait a week for it to arrive which is quite annoying
@_date: 2016-01-24 02:01:51
Thanks for the info. Does your limits page specifically say that it will increase in time? The only message on my limits is that it will be increased after I buy $1800

Coinbase was my first too. i've used some sketchy places to acquire BTC like this iPhone app Atombit which lets you buy straight from paypal. Works but it's pretty sketchy. Oh well, happy cake day!
@_date: 2016-01-24 04:05:48
What would this accomplish? Sorry if I'm asking a dumb question, I'm just still a noob with coinbase. Depositing to my USD wallet would still [take a week]( even for 10 bucks.
@_date: 2016-01-24 04:17:59
I guess my only confusion is what is the difference between depositing into my wallet and directly buying btc? They both take the same amount of time if the amount is over my instant buy limitation amount. thanks again!
@_date: 2016-01-24 02:34:40
weird. I am fully verified too and [my limits]( are a purchase requirement.

Look into the app Lawnmower on iOS. It connects to your coinbase account and does some reoccuring transactions based on how you set it up

mucho trial and error

this link was posted here some time back - 
if someone sat here for just a few minutes you'll see a huge transaction come through. just like you said - means nothing. could be someone moving money from one of their wallets to another.
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:45:01
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:30:27
Are you mass printing these? I'm interested as well!
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:36:23
This makes sense! I downloaded Electrum to my laptop as well as my Android mobile phone last night. I would assume that it's the most recent version.
 I did not import my paper wallet private key as I wasn't completely sure if it was actually moving those coins or just accessing them. By the sound of your reply, my initial thoughts were right in that if I had imported the key, the funds would be migrated from my paper wallet into the Electrum wallet. I also didn't want to mess around with importing that private key while my coins were still moving from Coinbase to the paper wallet.
I will treat these wallets as you've mentioned in your reply. I will keep my funds in my paper wallet until I am looking to actually spend those funds. When spending, I will import the wallet to Electrum. 
Thank you for the explanation! Much appreciated.

I had coins on Coinbase. After I got this email, I created a paper wallet and sent my balance there. 
Almost twelve hours later and there are zero confirmations. Is Coinbase not going to allow me to move my coins elsewhere before the fork? I am trying to find the transaction ID, but apparently before there are confirmations - there is no ID? Strange.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:08:59
That looks really well put together! Thanks for sharing the video. I am going to purchase and try it out! I have a Moto 360 first gen so unfortunately no wear 2.0. still gonna try it out anyway!
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:58:51
Wow that's quite interesting. I hope they figure something out before August 1st comes around. I guess if it never confirms then I should expect those coins to stay in my Coinbase wallet? Maybe I should take some screenshots of this transaction for my records... just in case they don't end up moving to my paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:37:54
Yeah it took 14 for my first transaction. I sent another this morning and had that one clear at the same time as the one sent the night before. It was interesting that they cleared at the same time even though I sent them several hours apart.
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:39:51
Interesting. I definitely have a bunch more reading to do about this. 
I was not sure if I imported the paper wallet private key into Electrum, if that were to actually *move* the funds into Electrum... or if it would just be accessing the wallet through Electrum. 
Perhaps I will create another wallet to send a few bucks to and then test this out by importing that private key and seeing how it all works. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:24:42
Yup, I have been checking the address of my paper wallet on the blockchain every few hours with nothing there yet. This transaction isn't very big.. only ~$120 bucks - so it's not the smallest either. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:22:18
Ah - finally!
Thank you for letting me know, I had stopped refreshing to do some real work at work today haha. 
I feel a great sense of relief that I now have my coins in a wallet where I am the only one with the private key. This is my first time using a paper wallet, I've only been using Coinbase until this point. 
If I were to import my private key to an Electrum wallet - do the coins stay where they are now? Or would they be absorbed into a new Electrum wallet? 
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:57:24
Their email literally told their customers to move their coins out of their exchange due to the upcoming fork. After following those directions - those coins are now somewhere in limbo. What a pain in the ass. I know I probably should have withdrew those funds sooner than I did... but this is ridiculous. I think I need to stop using Coinbase all together and find a better exchange. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:49:23
Yes! I am pleased that it ended up going through. Took much longer than I've ever experienced with Coinbase before. Probably due to, just as you said, all of their users trying to move their funds off their system. 
I am feeling a bunch of relief now that I have my coins in a wallet where I control the private key. This is my first time using a paper wallet, I've only been using Coinbase until this point. 
Do you know if I were to import my private key to an Electrum wallet - do the coins stay where they are now? Or would they be absorbed into that new Electrum wallet?
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:06:39
Sweet! Do you have a demo app (or even a YouTube video of this in action?) I'm interested but don't like paying for an app without getting to try it out first.
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:52:17
Yes. The transaction shows as pending. 
Here's a [screenshot of the pending transaction]( Shows as pending with zero confirmations, and no linked transaction ID. My current BTC balance on Coinbase is now ~$0.10 - so the funds did move and are currently in limbo.
