I am so happy to see another "Wall Street veteran" join in on the discussion. Being well connected, but having never heard of you, I thought the prudent thing would be to check you out. After all, how do I know you aren't just a cat sitting on a laptop randomly hitting keys, or the guy from Nigeria who keeps wanting to send me my dead uncle's money?
Luckily, we live in the digital age, and every serious investment firm has a professional website. Let's take a....argh....I must have accidentally traveled back in time and hit a Geocities page. 21 years in business, and apparently the website is just as old.
The "Fenton Libertarian Report"? Interesting. I didn't realize financial investment firms typically make political statements.
Oh look, there are other services you provide. Trustark.com. Sounds serious. Let's see....Ahhh, "premium japanese sex services". Quite a service you offer there. Does that come for free with your financial advice, or do I have to pay extra?
I wonder what the [SEC has to say]( Atlantic Financial Asset Management.
Properly registered in MA. Check.
Last filing: Dec 2011. Hmm...not keeping up with regulatory filing requirements, I see?
Employes: 0.... Zero?! This must be a mistake.
Section 5.C.1: To approximately how many clients did you provide investment advisory services during your most recently completed fiscal year?
....Wait, what?
Section. 5.F. Regulatory Assets Under Management:
Zero, also known as zilch, nada, nothing.
Well, maybe you are so good, you know how to hide your activities. Let's see the state of your insurance bond:
THE HANOVER INSURANCE COMPANY
Amount of Bond: $10,000.
Ok, I think I've seen enough. Clearly a cat after all.
