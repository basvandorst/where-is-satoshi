For the 5th time this week.  Stop this fucking FUD.  You're bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:24:59
I'm not talking about the text, I'm talking about your bullshit title that has nothing to do with BTC.  Kindly fuck off. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:23:25
I'm shitting myself currently.   HODL my butt.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:47:59
*buy the dip* is a dumb way to invest into BTC.
I bought ATH in 2015, now look.  Stop thinking about BTC like a stock market, think of it like gold.

Or since he's obviously asking for the safest least risky way of making sure he receives $250k, he could just get $250k.  He wants no risk.  Right now USD losses 2% value per year.   At any time that $250k worth if BTC could go up 33% or down 33%.  He asked for security, not gambling.  
I'm not a believer in conventional FIAT like most of us, but OP is just trying to be safe.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:19:27
Correction is just a relative term to us.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:03:37
What's the difference in the logic?  ATH is a temporary term.  I'm giving sound advice as a HODLer.  I'm sure plenty of others would agree.  But we are buried in a small thread on a meme subreddit.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:20:09
Keep it up.  But just buy every week at the same time regardless of market price.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:06:28
But... memes dude
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:03:58
r/investing wants you back
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:27:40
Oh my god
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:02:55
I'm trying.  Not to get too personal.  But I'm low-income and taking care of my dying/old parents.  EVERY paycheck I see bitcoin and my mouth waters.  But shit always comes up.  
CHEERS TO EVERY HODLR
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:07:27
What a the benefit of the choices then?  Just don't wanna commit on the wrong one
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:00:52
And it'll come right back per usual ;)
I have 4.0 BTC, I'm not worried.  I'm still at 400% profit. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:03:55
Nah fam
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:02:47
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:13:43
Not to seem pompous... but you don't sound like somebody with 4 years of experience here.  The fact that your friends are asking is a good thing, not a bad thing.  If BTC was a secret it wouldn't be worth 8KUSD
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:39:27
Asking for handouts on the internet from strangers.  
Sounds great selfishly, but in practice I don't agree with it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:40:47
My thoughts lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:11:35
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:11:13
ATH should be a suspended term until 2018 haha
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:55:24
Here for the Karma.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:11:40
THIS is still like 1% of its potential hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:28:51
Bye lol 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:33:55
That's kinda shitty tbh
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:40:16
Yes lol
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:50:53
I appreciate the offer, that's very sweet :)
But, I'm happily and locally employeed in Hotel Management.  As for my parents, they got to see me play basketball in school and semi-professionally.   It was my passion, and they were really proud of that. They are older for parents, but I should hope that they still love me regardless of how much money is in my bank :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:41:01
This is my new favorite MetA
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:48:55
You must be new here 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:59:21
I bought at 3k.
I bought at 7k.
I bought at 9k.
And I'll buy again and again. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:04:48
I wish I wasn't poor :(
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:55:05
I got a customer service rep for betonline.ag to buy $100 worth tonight lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:35:14
It can go past $1m 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:20:07
That's okay.  Reddit is obviously the best place for advice.  See y'all at "the dip" when you all try and buy in again when it never happens.  Like always.

I've been HODLing since 2015, you're talking to the wrong crowd.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:03:32
Please do.
He's 16.
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:26:18
Harvey fucked me.  Won't be able to buy I  until 2018 likely.  But if BTC really is the future (Or the now) then it won't be a big deal. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:07:02
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:37:39
Don't fucking sell
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:19:04
You're fucking dense as well lol
@_date: 2018-03-07 11:10:42
You're on the wrong sub if you're looking for expert analysis 
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:44:14
Thanks!  I'll likely watch what happens over the next 2 weeks, make an assessment then and start small then at the beginning of 2018 see what's happened and likely go all in if all seems well.
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:50:15
In the future, don't put money you're not ready to lose.
But, especially in coinbase.
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:36:25
Is it safe to start out with Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:58:37
You'll get that vibe here a lot because most people here view reddit as the wrong place for little questions like this.
This sub is very... closed.
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:43:02
You won't see immediate impact.  If something negative happens, you'll notice a few days of drops before a large tank.
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:38:29
I appreciate the honestly.  I'd gladly accept other opinions but it looks like this thread is getting burried.

Edit: I just realized that only saying "Texas" is probably to most *Texas* way to answer that.  USA fam

[Here's the list of just sales, pretty incredible if you look at the time stamps.](

Generalization happening here buddy

Nope, just poor.

Hey guys, look.  Now we're getting 15 of these posts a day instead of 14 a day.  Bitcoin must be working. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:01:07
Ah, totally unaware of sides happening here. 
My fault, I made the assumption this was just general bitcoin shit.  
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:36:07

I only use coinvase for the mobile graph.  I can't be the only one. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:49:58
Anybody with a more balanced opinion that can give me facts?
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:03:12
At least racists don't kill babies, that's a pro.

@_date: 2017-10-13 02:47:33
This isn't what is making BTC rise
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:33:33
Thanks mate
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:53:30
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:15:08
Due to the spike I was wary of this.
I just have no resource of relativity.  I don't know if a drop below 4K is a dump or if the potential of a sub 3K is anything presented.  Through my looks at the movement within the last 3 months there would need to be a huge dump.
But that's also why I'm posting, I'm only familiar with general trading on a daily scale.  So any opinions are worth more than mine if you care to share yours.

Oh honey, you need to go watch a bunch of youtube and put that money away.

Thinking about investments this way is an easy and fast way to hurt yourself.
