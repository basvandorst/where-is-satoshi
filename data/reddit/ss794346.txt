I have an issue with the pumps as much as the dumps. There’s a difference between strong demand and appreciation versus a 1000 increase on the 5m and a corresponding dump a few hours later. Sorry not sorry.

Oh please. Katz was a nut job that was in favor of the gold standard. His lack of economic understanding resulted in unfounded conspiracies that are ankle deep. Go ahead and take his advice from the book you referenced: I’m sure shorting stocks and only staying in precious metals and arts through the past three decades would’ve done you well as opposed to investing in US equities. 
I do appreciate the response though. Reddit has a huge issue with central banks, but doubt many here can explain what it does and through what mechanisms.

Realistically though, what policies/protocols can be put in place to reduce inequality in bitcoin? It seems to directly contradict the autonomy of bitcoin. That’s to be a  downside to decentralization. 
The bigger concern is ghost volume and price manipulation. I welcome more regulation into crypto, depending how it is structured of course. I think exchanges should be punished for wash trading. There are systemic issues here that need to be resolved for bitcoin to be considered a big time financial asset.
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:35:38
And there exists the issue. Your goal is not to own bitcoin. It’s simply to make more $ at some point. You view it as an investment, I view it as an end goal. That’s where we differ.

Trend is not our friend here, but whatever. I’d rather wait 2 months or a year for this to resume a growth trend than miss out on the day it runs back. History shows that most gains happen in just a small period of time and I’m not of the mindset that I have the technical expertise to time that. 
This falls back to people playing with money they had no business playing with. I don’t feel bad for you or your poor money management.
For the people that drop out of bitcoin because it’s not ‘mooning’ , good riddance. You’re the part of this community that I despise.

I’d agree for the most part however I think this is worse for overall sentiment. It’s one thing to have a whale drop the price 500, it’s another when it requires multiple sellers. So yes weak hands, but not neccesarily a less bearish sentiment

As someone who works as an economist, my job isn’t bullshit unless you consider stress testing standards for large banks to be utter nonsense. Most economists don’t masquerade as fortune tellers. We provide an abundance of scenarios to ensure institutions are solvent at the end of the day. I can point out a bunch of shitty people in any field, but that wouldn’t fit your half baked narrative.
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:24:21
Easy come, easy go. The emotional manipulation is so obvious. Nobody will sell if price rises slowly, however if you have a 500 plus dollar surge and a corresponding fall, you get holders that get scared and dump. This has been the case for years, and will remain the case for likely many more. Just wait and don’t let volatility spook you.

You’re reading the exchange rates wrong.  You are referring to btc/usd not usd/btc. The latter is how much bitcoin 1 usd is worth. The other is how much 1 bitcoin is worth is usd.

I think, once again, we should all reflect on the gigantic ‘fuck you’ BTC just gave to the naysayers. 40 percent clip in a day should keep some shorties in the sideline and serve as a wake up call for institutions shorting. 
The China blockchain comment was huge. That isn’t one day pop news. I envision this will provide major support for bitcoin through the medium term.

That theory was always bogus. I don’t see bitcoin as it stands as a hedge to markets in the immediate term. Really depends on the cause of the market downturn. Currency war sure, but general economic weakness not so much. Bitcoin sold with the market last December and there’s no reason it wouldn’t do it this time around. Regardless, hold and buy here
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:09:37
That’s not how it works. It’s not as if someone sold 40B usd out of bitcoin. Don’t confuse valuation (market cap) with actual money flows.
For example, in a very illiquid security I could drop the market price 5 percent with just a few thousand dollars. The market cap however might fall by millions.

Those two rate cuts were during times of serious economic duress. At least for now, the Fed is painting this as an insurance cut, not the beginning of monetary easing. This happened at other times in history and did not result in a recession.  That’s not to say a recession isn’t coming, but as of right now the labor market is holding up, stocks are elevated, and corporate earnings  haven’t shown any signs of weakness. Delinquency rates are low. Corporate and government debt are potential issues. And of course whatever Donny is doing with foreign policy.
I’m purely focusing on the US here. Germany is already teetering on recession and the rest of Europe is barely advancing.

There are a bunch of morons here that just suck bitcoins dick for no reason other than for the memes. Those people can fuck off. In fact the majority of bitcoin shills are uneducated twats.

@_date: 2019-10-16 21:35:32
I wouldn’t hold to a specific time horizon because you’re effectively trying to time the market. That’s a no no. Instead focus on what you would be comfortable walking away with, be it a specific ROI or dollar value if that’s your end game. Also best to not share how much bitcoin you own on the web, be it less than one or 500. 
Personally I own btc to not own USD. It’s a hedge and frankly it’s new, abstract, and fun. I doubt I’ll ever sell barring unfortunate circumstances. To be clear, I don’t hate central banks like everyone else here. I’m an economist and understand the utility of central banks when acting appropriately and in good faith. The rhetoric surrounding central banks here is pretty toxic and misplaced if you ask me. People should be more concerned with our  ongoing fiscal issues than our monetary system. But I digress.
One last thought. All the hate directed at USD yet people always bitch about price swings. Does anyone else see the rampant hypocrisy here? Your investment thesis is tied to fiat failing yet you are hoping to cash out for fiat and buy a Lambo. It’s my issue with much of the bitcoin community. You have geniuses on one hand making innovation happen in crypto and you have the morons that are dragging it down as a get rich quick scheme. I sometimes struggle with this fact as I believe the average bitcoin investor is a moron which makes me,in turn, believe that I too am one. It’s another reason I’d prefer bitcoin to be referenced in usd/btc instead of btc/usd.

I think it’s a misinterpretation. Buffett is not a fan of gold for the reasons he’s laid out, he’s not trying to justify why it’s valuable. Buffett likes companies that produce goods, he doesn’t see that in gold or bitcoin. I don’t agree with him, but let’s not put words in the Oracle of Omaha’s mouth.

How about you read my fucking comment next time. I literally said “it can’t be stopped, but can be rendered unviable.” Does that change things on the “grand scheme of things.”  It sure does. 
Good lord do some of you people live in a fucking bubble. I love bitcoin but let’s not pretend countrywide “bans” for a lack of a better word aren’t a significant risk. Most people l know won’t be willing to break the law for bitcoin. Maybe some of you would. Institutions also wouldn’t. To act like there wouldn’t be a material impact on demand is idiotic to me.
As Gerard Butler said in law abiding citizen, “how fucking misguided are you?”
And how original, a prohibition reference! Really? You can’t think critically beyond, “duh anything that’s gets banned duh must be sort of like prohibition” What a gifted mind you are.

Yes. You do. Technically. That 1000 profit should be considered earned income in which you pay taxes on. It’s simply on you to report it or not. It doesn’t matter if you gift the 1000.
On a side note i find it hilarious how many people (not saying you) seem to shit on paying taxes then speak negatively about the wealthy or corporations that do the same thing. All in the same breath. I’d personally appreciate people not to use bitcoin as a means to evade taxes.  The  current crypto tax law is fucked and that type of behavior only distracts from the actual conversation that should be occurring. The amount of people I see discussing tax evasion related to bitcoin versus capital gains via stocks is astounding to me.
