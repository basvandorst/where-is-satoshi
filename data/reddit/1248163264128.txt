Nah I already received my bitcoin, 0.001BTC from jason I just wanted to try the browser out.

I couldn't sleep, saw the news, and immediately bought .1 BTC for about $50. I know its not much but it was all I could afford; I'm planning to hold on to it long term and slowly add more.

Disconnect that laptop from the internet, just to ensure people can't hack into it remotely.

System cannot find the file specified.
I'll try it on another PC later and give you guys feedback. It actually looks like a really cool browser and I wanted to try it out.

So I downloaded and installed the browser, but its not launching. It says Validating Install, downloading latest version, launching cycle, then just closes.

You should only spend what you're comfortable losing all of. Just buy it and forget about it, hold for like a year or more. View the money you put in as gone to 0, not as potential money.
