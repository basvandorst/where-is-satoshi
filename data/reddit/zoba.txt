I just called the support number on Mt Gox’s website. After a 15 minute wait on hold I got through to a very friendly woman who was just barely capable of speaking English. She took down my name (not sure why). I asked her if I would get my money back and she said that no one was sure. Then I asked what is going to happen, like, whats the plan? Whats coming next? She said she couldn’t comment on individual accounts, but that an announcement would be appearing on MtGox.com in 2 hours. (That would be 9PM Pacific March 2nd).
I’m a little worried there may have been something lost in translation (at first I thought she was telling me it takes 2 hours to update MtGox.com’s homepage). However I pushed for clarification and she said it again that there would be more info on MtGox.com in 2 hours.

Not sure if my server will stay up.  Here is the text:
Right now in  someone named nanashi____ claims to be speaking for a group of hackers who have gotten into Mt Gox in an attempt to figure out what happened. Nanashi says they have a DB dump and are looking at what to do with it. Nanashi gave these links:
A conversation in Japanese with Karpeles and a Banker (
Some Mt Gox Code (
Nanashi says the group plans on releasing more info. Nanashi also said they group plans on not releasing the huge store of passport scans they found… Hopefully this group has the public’s best interests at heart.

I agree it was either Karpeles or one of the other devs/someone "on the inside".  I'll continue to believe that until they give us some evidence, and I hope other people believe that too.  They're more likely to cough up evidence if they've got blame pointed at them individually...unless theres no evidence to produce which points at someone else.

The lady I spoke with told me 2 hours.

nanashi said there was a database leak, right?
