Oops, missed your ninja edit.
I'm sure they are, but that doesn't negate the fact that the most useful application of bitcoin is facilitating the transaction of illegal market goods.

Is that the darkside where bitcoin's primary usecase is to facilitate blackmarket transactions?

Augur and smart property are applications of centralized public ledger behind bitcoin, not an actually use of bitcoin. Using bitcoin as a bank means that you're susceptible to the wild price fluctuations of bitcoin and therefore your purchasing power isn't stable and may tomorrow be a tenth of what it is today. Joint custody wallets share this defect. As a transaction system, while it does have the ability transfer minute quantities of value and is relatively friction free, transactions cannot be clawed back in the case of theft or fraud and the transaction volume capacity of bitcoin is less than a statistical error when compared to existing payment systems. Unless TRUSTLESS is a backronym there's no need to shout, since you have to trust that you haven't lost a significant amount of your purchasing power overnight, you have to trust the merchant you're buying from not to be a con, you have to trust that a majority of the miners are honest and aren't modifying the blockchain, and you have to trust that people will continue to accept it. "No censorship" and "internet of things" are meaningless buzzwords.

Not SRS, but is that the best comeback you've got?, cause there's a lot of darkside to bitcoin already.

A lot on the black markets is harmful, but the fact that it is most useful as a method of circumventing laws is not exactly a ringing endorsement of it as a useful piece of tech for anyone who intends to stay within the bounds of the law.

(4) Businesses need their spending power to be predictable. Bitcoin's price volatility means that it's not as useful as a store of value as fiat currency is.

However, the rate at which it does so is slow and predictable. A currency that can gain or lose fifteen percent of its value in an afternoon is poorly suited for planning financial decisions over any real length of time. This would make budgeting an essentially impossible task.
