Would you pay a minimum amount (micro payment) for each movie you watched if it meant a guarantee you would not be fined? As for the porn industry, it would have to go to the producers first rather than directly to actors to be feasible however the actors would still receive royalties from the producers. The only way this would work would be if the porn industry tries this social experiment the same way the porn industry decided the outcome of the bluray format.

The money wouldn't go directly to the director but it would go to the producers and royalties distributed the same way as at a cinema. Would you rather risk paying a large fine or donating a tiny minimum amount of which would guarantee no fine?

if i live to be an old man i imagine myself saying "back in my day, we paid to use the internet and have our information collected"

you wouldn't donate straight after watching the movie? even if it was easy to do from the torrent client? would you rather a set rate per month/year with a voting system determining which producers get how much at the end of each month?

I imagine if someone set up a reserve on behalf of movie producers that it wouldn't go down too well even though a lot of anarcho-capitalism is already going on illegally with out producers seeing a cent.
Setting up a voluntary donation system to specific actors or contributors would not be feasible because that would mean less money for the producers of whom have most of the control/rights.
I like the micropay idea, however I would suggest micropayments do not begin until 25% through the video stream/minimum second count.

There isn't really a way to seize Bitcoins, however more mainstream currencies can be frozen and sent to the correct producer. There could be a way to have a minimum amount of time (a year?) for the escrow service to determine the correct producer for each torrent.

I wouldn't suggest extra advertising -- If the movie is different to what are now popular movie torrents in any shape or form aside from video quality then there would be no incentive to simply choose a torrent that doesn't offer the voluntary contribution.
If the torrent hosting services are inclined to cooperate with producers and tag each torrent that holds copyrighted content with legitimately verifiable methods of voluntary contributions then this would be beneficial financially to both producers and torrent hosting websites.
Torrent hosting website advertising is generally all click bait however with torrent video streaming within the browser this could change.

if it were a set rate per month then it would essentially be netflix however netflix has a limited catalogue where bit torrent does not.
