RBC suddenly cut me off last week, but just like 2 or 3 days ago it was re-activated or something? I have no idea what happened or why. Hadn't got around to calling in.
I had issues with buying off QuickBT before, but had to call and say it was okay, and they let me continue buying.

why though? he's a strong advocate of disruptive tech overall, not JUST bitcoin. (e.g. he's got that book on ethereum coming out) 
while i do agree that it's best to get into btc, i also think if bitcoin will take off (even more), it's absolutely, positively going to lift up a bunch of other coins/chains with it

vitalik has all the business in the world to have opinions about these things and discuss them in interviews when asked, or talk about them on his private social media outlets. what are you even talking about, dummy?

i've had transactions get "stuck" for days at a time. i know it's gonna make you nervous regardless of what people say, but it's really probably just backed up and very likely will arrive later rather than sooner

@_date: 2018-09-12 20:35:01
to summarize: you don't believe vitalik has a place to discuss economics (lol), you think he shouldn't discuss markets without a PR team, and now you're asking if i'm 'fucking retarded' because i'm not outraged and trying to police people like you are  
this conversation isn't going to go anywhere. you're either in a panic or just someone who communicates that way because you're on the internet and have to stand out somehow. but just to finish up: i think the entire crypto space is facing a thousand roadblocks. so, for me, a delay on PoS is hardly a shitstorm. the ethereum team is pretty transparent about the issues they face. if it isn't ready, it isn't ready. if something passes it by, something passes it by. i'm not holding my breath for that, but who cares? again, the technology should speak for itself.

when you have to exaggerate to make a point, you should ask yourself whether your point is all that solid to begin with. it honestly just seems like you're anxious or nervous about your bags being worth something and not whether or not vitalik 'has business' speculating on speculation   


no he isn't  


cringe  


what shitstorm is ethereum in?  


nobody gives a single shit about charlie lee or his 'branding' outside of karma farming emotional investors on reddit    
either the technology is good or it isn't. your emotions related to your investment are irrelevant to everyone

then it isn't bitcoin  
where is your confusion coming from?

i was under the impression Pine is a woman too, and thought it was common knowledge. wonder where that idea came from? either way, whoops.

when you say ignoring electricity costs, do you mean electricity isnt an issue? if so, you could probably get an old S5 or something. if its for home mining, you could just spend a bit more and replace the fans to quiet ones
or maybe a small podminer from sidehack (bitcointalk) - but  i'm not sure how much you'd generate over a year

are you aware of OP's work? he's done some god-tier stuff IMO. not sure how you can view it as a scam...  
i get why or how someone wouldn't like it. i've seen plenty of white paper artwork on this sub before, and i haven't really liked much of it while some others have.  


it's literally signed and numbered by the artist. that's what makes it collectible. again, i get that you may not like his work here or previously, but i do!

@_date: 2018-10-24 03:57:00
did he not have an editor to cut out the tangential ranting that goes on in some sections? the part about art, in particular, is excruciating 
@_date: 2018-10-15 01:12:40
art: whatever trump lovers say art isn't 
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:56:15
you're gatekeeping the word "art" without any substance, yet calling others arrogant know-it-alls  
i can't even imagine the mental gymnastics you must go through to be pro-patriotic murican conservative and pro-bitcoin at the same time...

why would someone spend their btc on these cheap, generic shirts that cost less in USD on virtually any website on the internet? am i missing something?
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:55:56
this has literally nothing to do with bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-29 09:31:32
nope, but i know people who have. in one case, my brother's friend was selling licensed characters and logos on leather goods on a very large scale. he didn't even get hit with a lawsuit, just threats  
edit: to clarify, you DO get flagged and threatened - but there won't be a lawsuit directly against you (unlikely)
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:58:35
lmao if you put these stickers on, say, etsy or something, you'd receive a warning and that's likely it - keep selling them, your account will be taken down

Stiglitz has never said anything substantive about bitcoin. and his views are neither quiet nor muted, he's used very large platforms to express his extreme prediction: bitcoin is used by boogeymen and therefore should be banned. and because i think it should be banned, it has zero value

semi-related question: is there a point in reading that if you're not a developer, or a coder or anything? i've already read the internet of money, just not sure where to be going next

took me almost a year to finally understand this mentality. just wanted 24/7 eth moons, but now i wouldn't mind a crash. i believe in the tech enough to expect rebounds no matter what happens. i would love some $1000 bitcoins.

can't really be a regular day with coinbase not allowing sale or purchase of bitcoin, can it?
