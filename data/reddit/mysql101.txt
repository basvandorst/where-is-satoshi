The dump started prior to the story release, so it really didn't have the impact attributed to it.

That's not how price is determined. Price is set by the lowest seller, not by number of people spending the currency.

So if I lost my drive then I just need the 12 words it told me at wallet creation and I can install electrum and be on my way? That was my major issues with the hardware route. 
What's the recommendation for hardware wallet? I've been looking at trezor but I've seen reports of some exploits

I'm still debating if that is the way to go. I can take a secure linux distribution, do a bare bones install, and use that with my wallet of choice on a computer via usb boot drive and it would seem to be that it would be just as secure, if not more so since it wasn't designed to deal with BTC and so no one expects to embed anything in the src.

Downloading the firmware source and compiling it is still an issue since someone can hide code in the source and I'm not going to be reading and understanding all of it. 
That said, I went ahead and bought a trezor... I do like that the key is never in plaintext on a device with internet.

Last question. What are the odds the device I buy from a seller on Amazon could be compromised? Given a lot of electronics are made in China, and they make some really good knockoffs.. I see a trezor on Amazon sold by cryptohwwalletcom but Amazon also can coming left inventory on hand and even if the seller is ok, another sellers product might get shipped.

Hardware wallets make me nervous. You can restore a lost device by entering the seed into a new device, but what happens if the company isn't around anymore?
I am going to just install Linux on a bootable USB drive.

How would BTC work in real life? Two people meet to do a trade of product for BTC.. one guy watched the other enter his BTC address and send some his way. Does he have to wait for confirmation? What if the other guy was on a local network and was running a single node?

Looking at the movement of BTC as a stock, it looks like it's going to drop down to the original curve, so around 2100. But BTC isn't a stock, so...
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:42:55
Ah, so I can install electrum and enter the 12 or 14 words and get access?
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:29:12
Because i would be booting off the USB to a Linux system and it would only be used for BTC.
But based on other comments, the hardware route is pretty decent too. I'd still feel better using a USB boot system than my windows desktop.

yeah, you don't get to specify the outgoing rate, it cost me $5 for the last 3 transfers I did. 
Also someone is an asshole for downvoting me.

I don't think it's their legal duty to support every fork that gets made. You and I could generate thousands of forks an hour and they shouldn't have to support that. 
If they gave users notice to pull out if they wanted bch, that's all they needed to do.

Coinbase is going to require a $5 fee to escape their wallet.
