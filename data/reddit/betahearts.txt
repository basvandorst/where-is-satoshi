I guess my point was, learn a bit about bitcoin before crapping on it. Sorry for being a dick. Explanation is Nicehash isnt the same as bitcoin. Its a 3rd party that people decided to (now) foolishly trust. Bitcoin is not associated with Nicehash anymore than milk is associated with the grocery store it's sold at. Bitcoin is secure because of the private key system. Keys are randomly generated and verified by algorithms - no one can steal your bitcoin unless you let them, essentially. 
Edit: annndd even my nice reply gets downvoted, you never win

Say yes, sell their private keys, claim you got hacked. I call it the Nicehash approach

Only after I have my moment of superiority... ok fine you're right. 
They looked at me like I was crazy, and here we are.

this is 100% incorrect and your comment displays your lack of understanding, because if you understood bitcoin at all you wouldnt be saying this

Point and laugh... and then direct them to useful youtube videos and offer any assistance you can
