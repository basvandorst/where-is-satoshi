Do you have that same shirt with Bitcoin instead of r/bitcoin instead? i.e.

Sure, that guy is throwing around 80+ million USD just to make a point

Question: Why does a full node need to have the whole blockchain? Wouldn't it be enough to every month save the status of everything before, deleting the history of transactions before?

Then the valid solution would be to check and disallow repurposing of Bitcoin data fields (not sure if that's possible), not to blacklist some offenders.
If the system allows for this to happen when it should not happen, the system is broken and it needs to be fixed, but blacklisting participants is not a solution.

well, it didn't work for me

They [do respect]( it, the question is more how that URL got on the internet
@_date: 2015-01-22 17:41:37


Um yeah cool story bro. You got a source for that?

Except Ethereum classic has a market cap of $120 Million, and ETH and ETC together have a higher value than before the fork, even though the fork happened in basically the worst way it could have.

That's not how it works. Did you mean watt hours per day?
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:31:03
Where?  Last I see is Nov 10, at 12 pm
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:13:57
No. 50 sat/byte transactions have not been confirming one tiny bit since Nov 10, just look at the link of your parent comment.

Maybe two years ago. Now more like $0.10 if you want it to confirm in less than an hour.

Why fraud?
Isn't making users pay more for texting than it costs to provide the service the same as making the fees on money transfer higher than the transfer costs?
As far as I can tell both of this just puts a limit on the profit margin, and the roaming regulations worked.
Not saying this would work, but I don't think the argument that it can't work is valid.
@_date: 2015-03-11 13:57:57
Well yes, but I'm pretty sure their inland price didn't increase because of this, neither did mine.
@_date: 2015-03-11 13:10:29
I disagree on that as a general statement.
They also put [a limit on roaming (calls, data and sms) costs between european countries]( It worked, I now pay less to write a text message when I'm abroad than when I'm in Germany.
Edit: 7ct vs 9ct last time I tried
@_date: 2015-03-11 14:37:12
Okay, thats possible. I assumed since there wasn't any increase in Germany the results should be similar in the other affected countries.

Why is there no statistics or other information on the website? It seems very lucrative, but even more shady considering there is absolutely nothing about the potential risk in the "about" or support page. If you google "poloniex lending risk" this reddit post is the first and basically only result.

It is possible with the system, but as far as I know there is implementation yet.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:40:25
nope, no experience, just saw it posted here earlier today. just read into the concept and it sounds great
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:56:51
exactly what I'm hoping for.. not good for the currency though
looks like i'm right so far

I don't really know anything about this, but your explorer.exe has really weird capital letters... Explorer.EXE might want to look at that?

The Address is a [160-bit Hash](
 this means it is statistically almost impossible to generate the same address as some person
this is similar to [UUIDs]( but far more extreme
*[...] To put these [probabilities] into perspective, the annual risk of someone being hit by a meteorite is estimated to be one chance in 17 billion,[35] which means the probability is about 0.00000000006 (6 × 10−11), equivalent to the odds of creating a few tens of trillions of UUIDs in a year and having one duplicate. In other words, only after generating 1 billion UUIDs every second for the next 100 years, the probability of creating just one duplicate would be about 50%. The probability of one duplicate would be about 50% if every person on earth owns 600 million UUIDs.*

add a new line after each point
The bitcoin currency is adored by people who are desperate for money. They simply believe that this is the way out to realize their dreams. Unfortunately, as opinionated by economist and analyst, this is a certain bubble and doom to be crashing in the very near future. So, to have a better picture of the bitcoin, litecoin, novocoin and other virtual and "invisible" currency, this is simply a story of Emperor's New Clothes. The clothes are the bitcoins and its related so called "coins". The tailors are the whole system of these virtual currency. Now, who are the Emperor? Obviously, anyone who puts their money and believe that this is the way they truly earn a huge money in a small duration of time. Why bitcoins and other virtual currency are considered clothes from the story of Emperor's New Clothes?
1. Cryptography is an algorithm that can be changed by the one writing the code.
During my college days, we played around programming c++, turbo pascal, database sql and other programming languages. Anyone can learn this if you want and you have the time for it. However, this programmer as he said "Satoshi Nakamoto" not his real name has written a program as they said a "cryptography" algorithm using c++ programming languages. This is the foundation of the security in this virtual currency. Let us assume that I can code the same algorithm and surely I will know also how to tweak it to benefit my side. So, the next question is how can anyone rely on an algorithm that can easily be changed in a split of second.
2. The vulnerability of computing technology is really high-risk.
As they have said that this is more reliable since it is shared with peer-to-peer networks and it cannot shuts down all at once, indeed it is true. However, there is a big "but". Bill Gates created microsoft windows operating system and claims at first to be the finest but it is vulnerable to viruses and malware and of course, we have this so-called "bugs" in the software. The truth is anyone can write any algorithm that can counteracts with a particular software. This is the same with this new virtual currency algorithm that many people believes that it is invulnerable. It can be hacked. It can have "bugs".
3. Transparency of the whole system is absent.
It is exactly the same as the story of Emperor's New Clothes that the clothes is truly invisible and intangible as well the virtual currency. Indeed, the virtual coins are invisible and intangible. Yes, because they are virtual. However, this is not what we worry about. It is the whole system of bitcoin or virtual currency economy. Where is the total picture of the total blocks of the mining ground that the all virtual currency diggers? Can we monitor this? The answer is "no". I have really tried each of the "open-source" mining software to mine some bitcoins. It is somehow like mining without a light and direction. I can see only numbers increasing and not even if I can mine thousands, this is really just like an increasing number that can increase to infinity. This invisibility of the whole system is indeed obnoxious and you cannot rely on it.
Hopefully, this analogically explanation using the "Emperor's New Clothes" story will open up the eyes of the unreliable virtual currency. Be not the Emperors! Be wise.
