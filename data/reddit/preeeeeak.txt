Bitcoin is useless

I just my coins safe.  I don't plan on doing anything with them.  The hardware ledger  seems to be the best option.   Thanks for the help I really appreciate it, was not try ing to give anybody a hard time.

So if I store it myself I will have access to the spinoff coins?  
What is a good online wallet or is coinbase safe?   Thank you for the help,  more I read the more confused I am.  I hope I will catch on soon.

Isn't more better?

My rate has been the same since 2006...  never missed a payment

Thanks.  What if Trezor is the bad guy?

Thanks a bunch.   I will delete thread.

Thanks.  My order was placed yesterday.  May buy a few more if I am happy with the product.

Lower price.   I am thing that people are buying bitcoin to get free coins  and driving price up..
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:34:21
Coinbase will only let me use a credit card with high fees and can only buy small amount.  
I want to spend 5-10k.   
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:07:49
Thanks.  What if the people making the hardware ledger are dishonest? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:33:33
So that is why the price is going up?  People are buying now because they want both coins.  After the fork it may drop?  Do I even want the other coin? Serious I have no idea if it is good. 
When is the fork anyway?

 Lots to take in bit I am getting there.  Thanks for the help.   You helped me a lot.

I want to transfer to a hardware wallet.  Do I have to transfer out of coinbase to something like GDAX and then to my hardware ledger.

If they put their own firmware on the device maybe they can prevent that notification?  
I am new... just want to cover my bases.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:03:44
This is not hard as I thought.   I just bought my first coin with coinbase.  Only 100 bucks worth.
So now I can't get my private key until I get my Wallet?   The other number is my address?
Do the wallet will generate my key?  
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:36:05
I got it.  I am just nervous.  Lots of money for me.  I don't want it stolen.   I will check it out.  Thanks so much. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:10:03
So you are saying cold storage is safer?
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:03:19
Got it.  I will watch a video to get familiar with the process.
Will coinbase charge me to transfer my BTC to my Wallet?  Is there and penalty for not using the coins?  
I have to find a site that will allow to buy larger sums.  Conebase only let's me buy 100 bucks a week and won't let me link to my bank account.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:57:03
When is the deadline to buy?  
How do I make sure I get both?
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:43:24
They said they did a annual review, not sure if that is true but I never had an increase since 2006.  My investments have increased by 120k in that year.  Income and credit score steady...
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:55:52
Pretty sure the spinoff will drop.
