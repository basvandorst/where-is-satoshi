There is no museum like it in the US or maybe in the world) and it commemorates all the cryptographic breakthroughs that led to the development of things like Bitcoin itself.

People will have to submit transactions with a transaction fee in order to make it worthwhile for miners to spend that much effort.
Bitcoin is designed to transition (voluntarily) from mining revenue subsidizing the cryptographic hashing network into tranaction fee revenue doing same.
Nobody seems to understand, the mining thing is there to encourage the construction of a large, robust, distributed tranaction-processing network without a centralized funding source. It's an infrastructure-rollout-tax.
@_date: 2011-06-30 23:04:59
Well, true. I guess I meant that will rise to an equivalent of what 50BTC is worth today. There's not hard and fast rule, it's just that the transaction fees for a block have to be worth enough that miners and pools keep processing transactions.
@_date: 2011-06-06 16:05:08
However, BTC/$ rates have more than doubled in the last few weeks, so it would appear mining is actually increasing in profitability.
@_date: 2011-06-29 15:49:33
The number of solutions that would need to be tested is incredibly small. A CPU could keep up.
@_date: 2011-05-30 15:38:31
Thanks for the hay-BTC.
I presume you've already seen this:
The Merkle root (Never met Mr Merkle myself, but I met Whitfield Diffie at a cryptography luncheon once...) is a hash of all of the transactions you included in the block, including your "pay me 50" transaction that is consensually allowed by the network.
You hash this block header over and over, twiddling Nonce and generating a new hash and seeing if it is a winner. You DON'T have to re-generate the Merkle root hash each time because nothing in the transactions block is changing for each nonce. If you run through all the nonce values without getting a winner, you go back to the transactions block, and twiddle the extraNonce in your own pay-me-50 transaction, hash the Merkle root again (once) and start over running through all the potential nonce values based on that Merkle root.
Lather, rinse, repeat.
The other page I was trying to find was this:
In particular, refer to the pseudocode in the message "Post by: Pieter Wuille on April 07, 2011, 09:57:25 am". It explains the anatomy of hashing much better than I've seen elsewhere.
BTW, what language ARE you using? Something tells me you have a super cluster system you're going to play with.
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:30:32
I would like to be able to pass on some tips. Thanks for the generosity.
@_date: 2011-06-30 21:44:34
Well, the aggregate transaction fees would optimally rise to 50BTC. So, (50BTC / num_transactions) to totally replace the mining fee. But, the mining fee will fall off over time, so there's time for the transaction volume and fees to rise to meet it.
@_date: 2011-05-30 05:00:49
I'll caution you to not try to read the SHA-256 OpenCL source in poclbm -- it's mind-numbingly inscrutable.
There's a few other bits to explain -- for example, it's actually a two-pass hash. One chunk of data is SHA-256 hashed, but this chunk does not contain the nonce. So, this can be precalculated and doesn't need to be redone for each nonce. A second hash is calculated from another chunk of data, involving the nonce (and somehow involving the first hash). It is this second hash that's important.
I had a pretty complete description of it somewhere, but I seem to have misplaced it.
If you're really trying to reimplement it, ping me out-of-band and I can give you more advice. However, it is not for the faint of heart.

@_date: 2011-06-07 21:28:46
CPU power is pointless.
Right now mining might be profitable, at least to break-even, if you can get a good card at run it 24/7 somewhere that electricity isn't too expensive. The difficulty is shooting up, but the BTC/$ rate has also shot up over the same time.
I've heard that all Radeon cards beyond about the 5830 are out of stock everywhere. 6990s were gone two weeks ago. 6970s followed a few days later, and on down the power curve.
@_date: 2011-05-30 15:30:18
Actually, I believe the hashing client is allowed to choose which transactions are in the block. So, for example, you could choose to only run transactions that include a transaction fee. Doing so won't help you find a winning hash any sooner, but if a significant number of miners choose this way, it will begin to delay non-transaction-fee transactions, thus encouraging the user base to being paying transaction fees. This is the post-mining model intended for after the 50 BTC reward drops and/or the difficulty drops to where it's not economical to mine just for the mining reward alone.
Your info is otherwise correct to the best of my understanding. Well written.
@_date: 2011-06-07 17:11:48
You're going to have a hard time proving transparency in the selection process.
@_date: 2011-06-07 21:54:54
A friend of mine with a couple of 6970s (that he bought for gaming) started about two weeks ago and has earned the equivalent of about $500 in that time. But, rates are always changing, and it's an ephemeral value. Don't spend money on hardware unless you're prepared to not make a red cent if the BTC rate falls for some reason.
For quite some time, investing in BTC has been a better return than mining. But investing you can lose all your collateral, mining at least you end up with some nice GPUs if BTC tanks and you lose all your BTC value.
@_date: 2011-06-30 21:26:02
Transaction fees. It's already part of the system, but almost nobody is putting them into their transactions.

 I imagine someone in the otc exchanges might trade with you directly. I would do it for you, but honestly, $50 isn't exactly worth the trouble for most people and you'd have no reason to trust my reputation.

I've explored the FPGA route a bit, since I have friends who do FPGA development. but you still have to invest a lot of work to realize returns.
I doubt you'll get huge gains over poclbm or phoenix. As a C++ guy, I've considered rewriting the client in C++, but the real heavy work (hashing) is done by OpenCL anyway. It's unlikely that optimizing the non-hashing code is going to give you more than a percent gain.
Optimizing the OpenCL code is a possibility, but that requires knowing the hardware performance characteristics of OpenCL and the device you're running on, and I admit I'm not strong there. Very few people are. I know one of them, but he's reclusive.
I'd be very interested in discussing the SHA keyspace idea with you. I have a pretty good background in crypto. I was one of the cypherpunks back in the 90s when Wei's paper was first published.
@_date: 2011-06-30 23:05:14
It could be, I guess.
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:23:43
I acknowledge YOUR throw the scent argument too.
Perhaps he INTENDED to have help, and decided to go it alone.
I will concede that Finney may not have been part of Satoshi. I have no way to prove NICK was, for that matter. But if it were &gt;1 people, it's Nick and Hal and if it's &lt;2 it's Nick. ;)
It's possible SN is Nick and Hal KNEW it was Nick and advised him, but didn't actually write the code or write discussions as SN. But it's hard for me to imagine that Hal WASN'T involved.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:17:28
There's just a few things that make me think it was at least two people.
I think Nick was the main public and intellectual part of Satoshi, but I think Hal wrote some of the code. Nick put out a call for collaborators to help implement BitGold (pre-Bitcoin) and I believe Hal stepped up. Hal's big thing WAS writing code. "Cypherpunks Write Code."
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:58:47
You raise good points.
Why was Nick asking for implementation help though?
@_date: 2011-06-13 14:55:59
My only recommendation is to NOT stay with deepbit. Many have already discussed the problems of too much concentrated power having the potential to subvert the network.
@_date: 2011-07-01 02:25:39
I anticipate that the per-transaction fee will be very small. Much smaller than the 2%-7% that credit cards and PayPal already charge. And consider that banks generally charge checking fees as well. Purely cash based transactions are the only ones that don't have overt fees, and that's because our banking systems are funded by taxes and other hidden fees.
In theory, non-fee transactions will still be processed by the BitCoin network, but processors will probably prioritize fee transactions to encourage paying for the system.
@_date: 2011-05-25 23:31:18
Technically, you'll still be doing the exact same operations as mining.
However, you won't be doing it for the "free" BTC in the successful block, you'll be doing it for the transaction fee reward embedded in all of the transactions contained in the block.
@_date: 2011-06-02 20:33:43
The elevator pitch is that the problem is always the same but the input data changes each time.
@_date: 2011-06-03 19:47:24
It depends on the terms of the loan. Your posting is somewhat unclear.
If you're borrowing $1000 today, you're not borrowing bitcoins. You're borrowing dollars.
If you borrow 72.6 BTC today (roughly $100 USD at this second), you're borrowing bitcoins. The terms of your loan could say you have to pay it back with interest in a year, in bitcoins, dollars, pobble beads or whatever else you and your lender agree on. But normally, your lender would stipulate you would pay him back in like currency -- as in, let's say 80 bitcoins (roughly 10% interest).
NOW what does it look like? 80 bitcoins in a year might be worth $10,000. In which case it's a GREAT deal for the lender, and a sucky deal for you. This assumes continued deflation. But it could crash too, in which case you might be able to get a million BTC for a buck which is a good deal for you.
Assuming deflation continues, you'd be silly to borrow BTC now unless you felt your own return on investment of whatever you did with that loan could exceed the deflationary rate of the BTC.
@_date: 2011-06-10 22:02:14
Seems a bit self-promoting here.
@_date: 2011-06-02 20:36:14
At this point CPU mining is very unlikely to return any BTC.
GPU based mining is necessary. Even with $700 of brand new GPUs, it may be weeks before you 'win' a 50BTC block by yourself. Therefore, most small miners join a pool like deepbit, slush or btcguild. Joining a pool like this increases the pool's odds of getting a winning block very slightly, and in return, the pool shares its winnings back to you in proportion to what you contribute. So, you'll get SOMETHING immediately, even if it is very small.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:27:04
If !(Nick + Hal = Satoshi) I'll eat a hat.
@_date: 2011-05-26 03:11:13
I believe the bitcoin client currently knows about several high-reliability peers hardwired into it. It will contact these if it cannot reach the IRC. From one of these, it can learn about the same peers it can learn about via IRC.
So, vulnerable, but not as vulnerable as you think.
@_date: 2011-06-25 14:55:21
More power to you. And while he's at it, have him sell anything else he has on hand for bitcoins. There needs to be more vendors selling for bitcoins and more infrastructure for accepting them.
@_date: 2011-06-30 23:06:37
Not true.
Mining (or processing transactions, as it is better called) is what keeps the network secure.
People don't do it for fun. They do it for profit. Therefore the network needs to be arranged to reward them for protecting the security of the canonical blockchain.
It's commerce and it works.
@_date: 2011-05-30 02:35:25
Basically, everyone is trying to find a hash of a block that meets certain criteria. the hash is a 256-bit number. The criteria is that there must be a certain number of zero bits in a certain position (I believe it's the leading, left end of the 256 bit string).
How many zero bits is determined by the difficulty value. Higher difficulty equates to a higher number of zeros. Because the SHA256 hash is unpredictable, you just have to throw different data at it over and over, and eventually by chance, you'll get a hash that meets those zero criteria.
Now, we don't WANT to throw random data at it. We want a hash that is still a hash of the block that we were provided by the Bitcoin network -- this is the only block that will be accepted back by the network. We've taken this block, and tacked on an additional transaction at the front that says "and I get 50 BTC". This is the mining reward. If we find a winning block first, the network will accept our block, which grants us this 50 BTC.
Now, there is one other part of the block we are allowed to tamper with. This is the Nonce field. We are allowed to cycle this field through all kinds of values. By convention, we start at 0 and increment it. Each time we alter the nonce, the randomness of the SHA256 hash algorithm means we get an entirely new hash. We keep twiddling the nonce value until we find a winning hash, or more likely, someone else does, and we get a new block and start over.
In theory, you could start the nonce value at some non-zero value, but since SHA256 is unpredictable, we don't know if values of 4 billion are going to hit the winning hash sooner, so it's just as easy to start at zero and increment. At least then we know which ones we've tried already.
@_date: 2011-06-07 22:16:16
Bingo. It's probably something of a bubble. Get what you can out of it while you can.
