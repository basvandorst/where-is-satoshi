Is this not essential a bookmaker? I just don't see what the hype is about. I know I must be missing something. If anyone can set me in the right direction it would be much appreciated!

Issue with our hosting company blacknight.com. Timing is not ideal.

Thanks 5tu, speaking with Irish importers and they seem interested. Lot of work to do yet. Our main aim at present is to raise awareness, that there is an option out there to bypass capital controls.

Either does SEPA bank transfers outside of Greece or Western Union. Bitcoin is a real option!

Is there anywhere we can view the slide deck?

CoinBase goes against everything Bitcoin stands for. It's becoming worse than a bank, monitoring all transactions, closing accounts, insider trading. 
Sure it was a great onboard mechanism for the nommies, that wanted to get rich quick but after that, I think it is more harmful than good.

I believe a lot of the gold buys are diversifying into crypto and bitcoin.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think transferwise are going for remittance, more aiming for large companies moving large amounts. Therefore 0.5% margin and a billion turn over will be very sustainable. Heck we only have to look in the bitcoin community to see the likes of circle charging close to zero fees and they are profiting or intend to in the near future.
