I agree that it shouldn't end here; his IP should be broadcasted, PayPal outed. PayPal piss me off because they ignore the fact that their service is being used to steal from other people.

Unfortunately not. I used PayPal Money. Such an idiot I am.
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:41:01
Yeah, you're right.
@_date: 2013-05-16 01:33:51
Very good suggestion.

Hey Ian,
I sent you about 3 emails about the issue with no response. Regarding the no reviews, that's not technically true. By googling "Stryder Bitcoin", you'll see that people have actually made many posts on Bitcoinary saying "STRYDER IS A SCUMBAG SCAMMER" under the Buy/Sell method. He's been known before and I should've seen it earlier.
Also, I think more should be done. You have his information, his IP Address. It's unfair if it simply ends here. I'm aware I shouldn't have been such an idiot, but this man is a criminal, and should be treated as such.

Yeah true, it's not entirely Bitcoinary's fault, but a swift ban for stealing hundreds of dollars is not a big enough punishment. His IP should be compromised and reported to the police, or something along those lines.

Very true. Lesson learned.
@_date: 2013-05-16 01:38:54
Definitely true. But take a look at the top sellers right now; a quick Google search of names such as "Stryder", "Phisppy" and others comes up with "SCAMMER" results. Such a shame.
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:45:10
I'm sure Ian has his IP address.

Wow. See, and we can't even put reviews of him on the site. There were all these posts about Styder being a scammer, but they're not easy to be seen.
