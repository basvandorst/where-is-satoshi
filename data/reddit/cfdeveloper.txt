furthermore, when logging into a site, password should be sent in form data, not url data, this way it won't be logged.  imagine a hacker getting access to their web logs; they'd have every fucking password.

this reminds me of a prank I played on my daughter.
I bought her tickets to see her favorite band... about a week before i was going to take her to the concert, i copied the bands website.
I made a local copy on my web server, changed the lmhosts file on her computer so that site would resolve to local server, and then added some blog entries.  namely how the band broke  up and the tour was canceled.  when i told her, first thing she did was go to their website to read more, and then she really started to freak out.  it was great.

@_date: 2017-12-12 20:32:28
Yes, that's my point.  you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin, and so many still don't seem to know that.  stocks to my knowledge can not be bought in fractions.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:24:51
This is very true.  I was talking to afriend last night who previously owned 3 btc, who sold them at 400/coin (against my advice) - and then he had the nerve to say "i can't afford it anymore, it's too expensive"..  "DUDE, you can just buy $100 worth if you want, it's not like stocks"

@_date: 2017-12-22 20:45:54
I had a friend buy about 3 btc @ ~450 a coin on my recommendation...  he sold when it dipped to 400 cuz he got scared.  he called me up a couple weeks ago to tell me how he should have hodl'd.

not even thinking of selling until 2020.  I'll go homeless before I sell.
and I have faced that reality before, where I lived in my car for a month.  I could have sold local for cash to get into a place later, but for once in my life, I'm thinking of my future.
