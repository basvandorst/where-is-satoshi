I feel weird to say that's what I'm leaning towards...but that's what I'm leaning towards. I'm trying to be skeptical and expect the rug to be pulled out from under me but damn. The gizmodo article is pretty damning as far as him having a hand in it goes. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 02:46:06

It really is the greatest story the Internet ever told. Anonymous creator(s) that would have amassed a huge fortune and later vanished, a site with card game backgrounds becomes the hub where piles and piles of money are exchanged, an illicit market with its own creator, people and federal agents go to jail, federal agencies sell off confiscated coins, and a $4.2 million dollar pizza. I just hope something can really do it justice one day.

If he has invested in it personally (which he has), he knows that furthering its roots will help raise the value of his holdings and convince other venders and merchants to consider it and further propagate bitcoin's infrastructure. Sounds like business to me.

So, a ton of gas stations around the country just start taking bitcoin indirectly. Fuck yes. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:07:47
Coinbase has about a 1% fee. Even with fees, bitcoin transaction fees at most cost equal to that of paypal and credit cards. Bitcoin services are able to keep these costs low because a lot of the work is done by miners. Now, mining fees cost pennies. Even with big transactions. That's IF you want to pay somebody and have it confirmed quickly. Wells Fargo has fees as high as 40% when sending money to certain poor countries. Around 10% normally. Credit cards cost around 3% per transaction. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:52:01
Ya. And he won't have to know what it feels like because he might actually do a google search before trusting a business with his money and personal information.

I completely agree and the people that sent money right before withdrawal problems are a tragedy and it breaks my heart. For those who sent it knowingly, they knew. What is crazy to me and you are the people who didn't bother attempting to get them off. You are probably like me. You are really into bitcoin and, not only feel the need to secure your coins, but you are fascinated by it and want to do it because it's neat. It's hard to imagine somebody that has gone through the trouble of getting bitcoin and doesn't go through the trouble of securing them. 
Now, I've watched the newest 4 hour bitcoin talk and they brought up a point. You and I are probably tech savy but we need better, simpler security for complete noobs. For serious adoption to happen, we are going to have to find ways for incompetent people to secure bitcoin on a level of cold storage. Just my opinion though. Complete idiots swipe credit cards hundreds of times a second. Bitcoin security needs to be stupid simple.

Inheritance tax may or may not be the driving reason for me getting into bitcoin. I don't plan on dying soon, but the idea of taxing money that has already been taxed is pretty shitty in my opinion. I get hell from reddit when I say that but whatever. 
That being said, the coins are *on* the blockchain. You never have them. You just have access to send them to other addresses on the blockchain. Say I have an account at Wells Fargo. All your money is is a few numbers in a computer and that computer can be accessed at any Wells Fargo branch. So, if you wanted to, I guess you could treat it like that if you wanted to be honest and document it all.

The process that made them is special. Allegedly, it hasn't been able to be reproduced. Only Stradivarius violins will sound like Stradivarius violins (some blind tests are interesting, however). They are probably the most sought after instruments ever made. It's worth a Wikipedia read for sure. Very interesting if you aren't familiar.

Just glanced over the paper after reading the wiki. It's the exact story I was thinking of. I wanted to say it was a way to attack rather than encryption itself. It had IBM in the story as well.

Don't think of coins or money at first. Think of a ledger. A big book with addresses in it. These addresses can have amounts of bitcoin next to them. This book keeps up with who has how much. 
This ledger is the blockchain. Miners use complicated math to write down new balances in this ledger. If the miner solves the math problem first, the miner gets some bitcoins next to his address. 
All bitcoin is is a number written next to your address. You can send these numbers to other addresses. Hope this helps
@_date: 2014-01-25 11:21:40
Uh... What? Where did you get your information? For starters, read the beginners guide please. That's not how mining works at all. And, it's hard as fuck and not to mention expensive if you even get the hardware in time for it to make any money for you (it has been known to take over half a year to ship the miners required to even break even. And they can cost several thousands of dollars) 
Overstock and tigerdirect just started accepting bitcoins. Okcupid accepts them. More places take bitcoin every day. Heck, check out coin map. Please don't run up in this subreddit without reading the beginners material and then drop some shit and ask us to prove you wrong.

"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."
Of course the more control Eric Holder and co. try to impose on certain industries, the more these industries will actively seek to use (and possibly even improve) alternatives. 
Now, Eric Holder has a long history of hating all things personal freedom but I'm not sure why workers in the porn industry are being targeted. Bitcoin might be a hydra but porn is a hydra an order of magnitude larger than Bitcoin right now. Trying to discourage it is laughable. There are few things that are certain. Among them are "death, taxes, and porn finds a way." The sex industry, and by that I mean porn and adult toys, can be one of Bitcoin's best allies. A stamp of approval from that sector would be huge.

At the 16:00 mark, Andreas starts talking about what he thinks about the history of Gox. From what he says, it is pretty clear that he thinks Mark K. founded Gox when, in fact, that is not the case. He thinks Mark is worthy of some praise for founding Gox. Mark came along *after* gox was founded.

This is a little off topic but does anybody remember the askreddit post that asked the computer science users what are scary things the average person doesn't know that would make them shit their pants? I'd love to find a link, but there was one story that stuck with me. 
It had to do with encryption. I can't remember it verbatim. There was this team that had developed a new type of encryption algorithm and submitted it the NSA. The NSA said "looks good, but you need to tweak it here" and didn't give a reason. The team was puzzled. Why? What was wrong with it? They did the necessary tweak and made the new version. However, 20 years down the line, a new type of exploit was discovered. This exploit would have destroyed the original encryption if it was left in its original form. The op used that, along with a few other things, to suggest that whatever type of security measures we are using, the NSA has a 20 year jump on the space and what is vulnerable and what isn't. If something is compromised, we wouldn't know for decades.

Couldn't agree more. Everything has pros and cons and everybody should read up and understand what works best for them and has a reasonable amount of security. Reasonable security could probably eliminate 95% of the sob stories we hear about hacks or the pitfalls of trusting a 3rd party. 
Electrum is great but, like I said somewhere else, you need to use it correctly. Encrypt your wallet before you back it up and if your back up gets into the wrong hands, you still have a factor protecting you so you can probably run home and move your funds or seed it and move your funds or whatever you need to do. You have to also realize your device has your keys and it isn't an online exchange. 
But you are right. Any solution can fail anybody if they don't possess at least a little awareness.

If you can, then by all means. I would do it a little at a time. If you have $1000 to spend, buy $25 or $50 worth of bitcoin once a week and spread your risk. Just an example.

@_date: 2014-02-06 07:35:00
That's what I thought. However, I can see how gox's inability to let bitcoins out can cause their price to drop. Demand for them was stifled on the exchange because people were using them to transfer value out when they wouldn't release dollars. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 16:09:24
Well, it measures a lot more stuff than that. For now, it may work when bitcoin isn't mainstream but if it ever did go mainstream, nobody is going to say "millibitcoin." Can you imagine a hobo asking for some centidollars? No. They ask if I can spare a few cents.

I'm surprised at the attitude. Ya, we've been pissed on a bunch but it seems it's really hard to step back and appreciate stuff while, at the same time, not coming off like we are rabid cult members. (I mean that in the best way possible) 
Think about if circle came out like it did today 1.5 years ago or the mycelium trading features came out back then. Holy shit people would be going nuts. I feel like the community is desensitized to good news. It needs to be hypersensitive to good news because the media/general population is hypersensitive to bad news. 
However, people are all too often letting greed and stupidity shoot them in the foot while also making us look like crazy fucking idiots sometimes.  A small fraction of bitcoiners that defy all advice to put in only what they can lose or the bitcoiners that say bitcoin *without a doubt* will change the world are the vocal minority that places like subredditdrama laugh at us for. We need to be explicit that it *can* change the world and we need to stop with the "bitcoin and not my stupidity lost my daughter's college fund" posts. 
We need to be excited and promote good news while also managing expectations and realizing that bitcoin's success is not set in stone. The future looks bright for bitcoin. Let's be realistic and accurate when we educate people about it.

You can trace their wallet addresses when they buy things. If any of them were Satoshi and even touched an address with coins that old, the entire bitcoin market would be alerted to it. Many people follow bitcoin days destroyed as well as the history of addresses with bitcoin in them. If any of the CEOs were Satoshi, they haven't touched a nanobit of the early mining. Given the nature of many of these CEOs, it isn't very likely that Satoshi is part or any of them.

Exactly. Your chip gets detected and, after you give permission, the site uses it and grants you access. Maybe you can get reward points or something the more hashing power you bring. Either way, you don't have to burn up the cards on the machine you are using to actually browse the content. All these USB block erupters may not be such a bad idea if this idea could be put in place anytime soon.

I agree and I'm kinda in the same boat. Bitcoin going up in value for the foreseeable future isn't 100% guaranteed. Not by a long shot. But if it fails or goes down in price, it isn't because bitcoin is a bad idea. It's genius and I believe it in but I'm not willing to risk half my worth on it. Diversity is key.

What is your definition of "general public?" And no. Satoshi premined about 8-10% of all bitcoin in circulatoin and about 4% of all bitcoin that will exist. How can you say something like that when 50% of coins haven't even been mined yet? 
Have you even been following bitcoin? TONS of great news came out while Gox was refusing to die. Perhaps the people in this market understand that Gox was just an exchange and has nothing to do with the security of bitcoin. Perhaps the people in the market see the value of bitcoin for what it really is. How have these regulators helped stop HSBC from laundering money for drug cartels and directly funding a drug war? I know why you think we have regulators but all regulators do is make sure the guys that are too big to fail don't fail. Hell, regulators probably would have bailed out gox and let it keep fucking over people.

Thank you very much for your advice. You sound like you know me. I have had long discussions with multiple doctors about what medicine has become in this country and where it is going. I'm vehemently libertarian. Even my parents (one of which is a healthcare professional) that have pushed me to be a doctor all of my life are having second guesses because of the environment of medicine right now. I think I am going to play both fields. I am going to apply for fall of 2015. Until then, I am going to finish up the last two big classes in my grad program and see if I can make anything happen with my bitcoin ideas. This grad program I am in is essentially classes from your first 2 years. I am taking it for two reasons 1) to delay signing my life away to med school and 2) When I get there, I hope to place better than I normally would if I hadn't gone through this program.

I've heard some really smart guys that knew their shit (doctors and financial types mostly which is who I spend a lot of time with. I'm applying to med school and have been observing lots of doctors) swear by this guys and he has helped them a whole hell of a lot for a long time. The only reserves I have are that he may have a few misunderstandings about bitcoin that are pretty important. For instance, I don't know if he fully understands why altcoins exist and how they can actually help the bitcoin protocol. He sees certain things as weaknesses but I see as features that were intentional at the inception of the protocol. That's what I got from it so far. I have access to the whole website now and I kind of wish there was a better search option to see all of his stuff on bitcoin exclusively. 
Edit: I will say, though, that this guy is very knowledgable and not a hack. I'm just not sure of his views on all aspects of bitcoin.

I am a grad student and med school hopeful. I was shadowing several doctors in surgery about two weeks ago. When there wasn't anything going on, I would hang out in the doctor's lounge with all the surgeons. I pulled out my iPhone. A doctor asked me if I liked it. I said "ya but apple is so anti bitcoin that I am about to switch to android." 
Immediately every doctor in the room got quiet and looked at me. "You have bitcoin? I've heard about it. How do I get some?" Some of the doctors were actually very tech savvy and already knew a good deal about it. Starting from the beginning, I explained bitcoin and the block chain as well as the current state of bitcoin and the potential it has. 
My point is, in my experience, people have heard about it and not all in places you would expect. It might surprise you that this entire story took place in Mississippi. I am a Mississippian that might be working for bitcoin this summer.

Ok, no problem. I'm going to break this down very badly because I got to get some sleep but it will work for now. You can get bitcoins by trading (for goods and services or other money) or you can earn them by a process called mining. If I wanted to, I could send you bitcoins pretty much instantly. 
Now, mining is not as easy as it is in your head. If you used the graphics card on your computer to mine bitcoin for the next calendar year running constantly 24/7/365, you would probably earn anyway between one dollar and less than a penny. In fact, you would pay a lot more for electricity and most likely a new graphics card (to replace the one you just burnt out) and it would end up costing you money. Unless you are a gambling man with several thousands of dollars laying around, you have no chance of making money trying to mine for bitcoin. Even then, you probably won't break even. 
Mining is a process where your computer solves problems to earn bitcoin but these problems also verify and secure bitcoin transactions in the system. So, it serves purposes of operation as well as introducing bitcoins into the economy. However, only 21 million bitcoins will ever be made. After that, miners' fees in transactions will pay the miners.  
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:43:58
I asked myself the same thing and Hal has answered it in other posts and threads. If Satoshi is identified, he could be attacked by media that could try to bring down/do damage to bitcoin. The nakamotos could be attacked by governments and arrested or corrupted. Also, as it stands, satoshi could hold $1 billion in bitcoins and some people have estimated $2.5 billion. It's just safer to deny the fuck out of you being part of the creation. It doesn't really matter, anyway. Bitcoin needs to stand on the idea of bitcoin and not care about who created it. My guess is that one day, he or they will make themselves known.

Well, you can use Blockchain.info to get started. I think it's pretty good to learn on. Personally, I use electrum. It isn't the prettiest when it comes to looks but it's my favorite. Blockchain.info is an online wallet and electrum is one that has the keys on a device locally but you can restore both with a seed if you lose access somehow I believe. On my iphone, I use a wallet app called "bread" so I can have my bitcoin on the go. It's good for small amounts or to learn on as well IMO. 
Anyway, just my personal recommendations!

I agree. I wish this issue would be addressed in its entirety and we can be done with it but that isn't going to happen right now most likely. Gox is on the forefront of the bitcoin community's consciousness and will be until it either fully opens or fully closes. My worst fear is that Gox continues to live a half life and continues to be pseudo-operational while holding many in the community financially hostage. 
It will continue to be the elephant in the room. It either needs to leave, be addressed, or shot. Until it does, it will just keep leaking bad news like a radioactive isotope emits gamma radiation. It will continue to devalue the community as a whole until this shitty ass company or Mark decides to stop being incompetent pussies.

That's not what I was saying. I'm saying it is online only in the sense that it doesn't have options for paper wallets or other things. You have to have your google wallet attached to a google account and can only be stored in a known place on the internet as far as I can tell. Right now, I have bitcoin on an address that no person or network has ever seen in a safe. You can never say the same for google wallet. It is a poor store of serious value. Even if you have a google wallet card or whatever, your account is still on a known network and can't be guaranteed secure. I don't know about you but I've had attempts on my google account before. Google wallet would have to be something similar to a hot wallet with your bank account as your "cold storage." So, by online only, I mean the account info is always only online. You can't send it to a made up address that only exists physically.

I completely agree and have the same concerns. I am pretty optimistic, though. Being able to send bitcoin as many times as you want to an almost infinite number of addresses I would imagine could make it troublesome to keep up with. Paper wallets allow you to store bitcoin in a place that hasn't even fully seen a network. Yes, much like dread pirate Roberts was found, anybody who isn't careful can be identified. But, with reasonable precautions, I think bitcoin is fine. For now...

Andreas would explain how bitcoin wasn't just for drugs and how it is mainly used for charity etc. and Brian would scour the web for bitcoin drug articles and pretty much say "see!! Bitcoin and drugs! Drugs and bitcoin! What do you say to that!" Whenever he opened his mouth, I would facepalm. Andreas mentioned that Satoshi was anonymous and before he got a chance to say why he was anonymous or explain the history around the pen name, Brian butts in "mother fucker doesn't exist!" And spread bull shit like "see if you put numbers to each letter and then spell Nakamoto backwards on google (etc etc and I'm not even kidding)" it just sucked because Andreas was trying to explain all of this and Brian was off to the side challenging him before he even got a chance to explain himself. Whenever something new came up, Brian would call bull shit before listening to the genius they invited on the show to explain it. He needed to wait until Andreas was finished explaining a topic before jumping on his ass. You could also see his google searches frequently throughout the show and it was fucking obvious that Brian was googling as much shit as he possibly could that would make bitcoin look bad. It was also painfully obvious that Brian didn't know a goddamn thing about bitcoin. 
It was just cringeworthy seeing this well spoken, well read individual explaining how the world will change and this guy is trying to use incorrect information to prove him wrong while speaking with the eloquence of Waka Flocka.

Well, with multiple wallets and a shady company, it's hard to know who has how much where :( there have been known gox addresses but, for all we know, they could be just moving funds to another address. 
Also, from what I've seen from the public keys known to gox, it seems like they put money into hot wallets and after a trade cycle, they put it on the address again. Kind of like a business does with cash in cash registers at the end of the day. This happened day in and day out but Karpeles never audited his shit so when he finally looked up at the balances and finally got a calculator out, he found out he was fucked.

Personally, I think it is impossible to start something big and stay anonymous while still trying to keep the protocol going the direction it needs to. I think it is pretty clever really. "Ya, I didn't start it. That was this guy that disappeared who I knew. I'm just an expert trying to keep it up." Again, it doesn't matter. It might be revealed when the time is right. It might not. Reminds me of Peter Parker. "Oh Spider-Man? Ya! He was my old roommate."

Okay. Satoshi Nakamoto is the creator of Bitcoin. He (or they) never came out in public. They only communicated for a couple of years on the bitcointalk forum and then he or they disappeared. Obviously, some people can't help their curiosity. 
Today, this journalist breaks this story and says she has found Satoshi and it is going to be on the cover of Newsweek's first print cover since I don't even know when. This guy she found denies it. All of the sudden, a P2P user account belonging to the real Satoshi Nakamoto posted something for the first time since 2009. "I am not Dorian Nakamoto." (that is the name of the guy the journalist found.) Lots of people said this is bullshit and won't believe it until he signs an encrypted message or moves coins because that P2P account could have been hacked. Well, the largest and oldest amount of bitcoin ever moved just moved. So, we are all gazing in wonder. It's him. edit: we think. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:45:45
It is but that doesn't make Gox moral. Gox has been shady for years. Normally, on a place like coinbase, you can send and receive bitcoins in and out of your wallet on the site quickly. Like, it takes seconds. Well, gox started taking weeks to send you your money. Whether that be dollars or bitcoins. That smelled funny to lots or people and they wisely moved their money as fast as gox would let them. Then, one day, gox stopped sending out dollars to your bank. Then, gox stopped sending your own bitcoins out when you asked. They stopped withdrawals. Just because you aren't a bank doesn't mean you aren't a shirty website, man. Gox is a central place and, if you used them, you had to rely on them. Make sense? Keep your coins on your own wallet. At least the biggest chunks of them. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:07:48
Ha ya that is what I actually mentioned in my original response to op. I always buy in smallish amounts. But coinbase has delivered on all transactions for me. Even my slightly larger ones.

The people that own the exchanges make most of their money from transactions. That is how their business brings in money. They have fees for each transaction. Price is artificially high, transactions slow. They lose money. And if they kept raising them, the prices outside the exchange (where probably 80% of bitcoin is kept) would fall and their personal fortunes would be devalued. No. You are mistaken.

Have you ever heard of bitcoin days destroyed? Look it up. Those coins would cause a noticeable increase in bitcoin days destroyed if ANY of them were touched. 
Satoshi has never touched his bitcoin. For all we know, he destroyed the private keys. He does, however, have extensive writings and forum posts that are still available today. It is clear what his intention is. That intention does not involve diluting the market. Either way, he has NEVER moved any bitcoins. Never sold any of them. Never donated them to charity. Nothing. He has stated he was simply starting and securing the protocol so others could take over.

I agree. I bought my first part now. I decided on how much I was going to put in on the China ban news and I broke that price into 3 parts. In case it goes lower, I'll buy my 2nd. If it goes even lower, I'll buy my 3rd.  Although it eats a little at my chance of gains, it also eats at my chance of risk. It also allows me to get in at least a little if there is a fast recovery so I am not left holding my dick waiting for the price to drop a certain amount to go all in.

I should mention his general impression is positive. Heck, he loved the idea from what I understand since he first heard about it. Just in terms of value, however, he thinks it will take a hit before it it climbs again and he gives you some convincing analytics that kind of say that. He thinks it is brilliant and it could really take off but that it is due for a nose dive. Therefore, the people that recommended him to me told me to get out of bitcoin for the time being. I had to explain that I'm not in it for the money right now. It just fascinates me and I don't have enough invested that would depress me if the value decimated. And, if it did, I would buy even more bitcoin. I wouldn't look at it as losing dollars but as an opportunity to just buy more bitcoin. Also, while he thinks it may be due for a nosedive like it hasn't seen before, I believe that all it takes is an exchange to open up in a country with serious economic issues for demand to shoot up again. Like you were saying, I believe this technology is disruptive enough that it kind of breaks the mold when it comes to conventional analysis. I believe that we will see a $10,000 bitcoin one day so beating myself up over a sub $800 hit would be silly IMO.

Currently, my bank has a coin machine at the front. You put coins in, then take the little piece of paper to the teller, and she asks you how you want the cash. I usually say "deposit" and then I just buy on coinbase with that. 
But, it would be awesome if coinstar did this and gave a little discount. Maybe not completely fee free like an amazon card or whatever because amazon has a central entity that can make those types of deals. However, bitcoin, I imagine, could cut some costs for coinstar if they decided to use it. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 07:25:32
You would have to find somebody willing to do it. Nowhere online probably will. All cards come with the possibility of chargebacks unlike bitcoin. How much is the card? What state do you live in?

So it's like what movie directors do with the MPAA. Send something with a sex scene and a few fucks to get an R rating. Take a few things away and boom! PG-13 for a movie that might have gotten R in the first place. Take a lot and give back a little to make it seem like you tried to be fair.

I agree but people also don't understand he comes from a comedy background. He actually used to do stand up. I think he tries to incorporate that to make his show interesting but he can overdo it. He would try to be extreme and wild and make some fun out of something that isn't supposed to be funny (like economics). He just needs to A.) do a better job of coming off as intentionally comedic and/or B.) lay off of it a bit more. I really don't mind the extreme analogies like comparing banksters to pimps.

Yup. Somebody pays you $5 in bitcoin. Coinbase is willing to instantly convert that bitcoin into dead presidents and send it to your bank account (or let you hold them all or some. However you want.) 
If I recall correctly, coinbase let's your first $1,000,000 in bitcoin transactions go through with no fee. After that, it costs 1% of the transaction. Still a good deal compared to credit cards.

Apparently, from what I have read, the max limit on the transaction rate, as the protocol stands now, is at 7 transactions a second (visa and MasterCard have like thousands a sec or something).

I believe he is referring to the fact that Marc (and circle maybe I dunno haven't kept up with them completely) have made comments or suggested that bitcoin was possibly made with the intention of potential government oversight or regulation one day. Marc has essentially said that bitcoin isn't for libertarians and that libertarians might be disappointed in what bitcoin is really for. This is evidence that Marc (and anybody that thinks like him) is wrong. Bitcoin was not meant to be regulated. 
From what I've read, Satoshi was fearful that bitcoin would get too much attention too fast. He feared that there would be attempts to squash it before it could show it's true potential. 
Edit: lol. Look what I found. "[Bitcoin is] very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though." - Satoshi Nakamoto

Unfortunately, Gox didn't work like you would think bitcoin works. We have public and private keys here but in Gox, you have an account that isn't necessarily tied to the block chain. When you ask to withdraw your bitcoins, Mt. Gox would send them from their own hot wallet. They didn't give you a wallet on the blockchain. It was like a collected pool of coins and dollars at Gox. Obviously, you can see the problems that can arise when centralization like this happens.

It sounds crazy but you are essentially correct. You need to research stuff before you go verifying your accounts with sites. Even before dogecoin's creation, a simple search would reveal endless walls of text bitching about gox. I got "into" bitcoin in November and even then I could tell that using mt gox was like sticking your dick in the used needle receptacle. Hell, don't even search. The homepage of bitcoin's subreddit has been plagued with gox drama for months. This guy says he was naive in his responses. That's a shitty excuse. Anybody that can add 2+2 should be able to see that gox is absolute shit and completely unreliable. For people that have had their money there for years and forgot about it, I can almost understand. But gox has a terrible reputation. Anybody that has chosen to put their money into gox after the previous "goxing" needs to see a doctor.

Except the AR-15 ha. When it came out, it was plagued with problems. Soldiers would kill an enemy, take his AK, and leave the AR in the mud on several occasions. They have gotten much better but even to this day, ARs are built with fine tolerances and you are advised to keep them clean. 
Now, after Kalashnikov made the AK-47, a Russian gunmaker came up to him and said "I made a rifle with tolerances so fine, you couldn't fit a grain of sand into the gun." Kalashnikov replied with "I made my rifle so you could throw handfuls of sand into it." There are now more Kalashnikovs than any other type of gun on Earth. You can make them from anything and they cost nothing. You can make one out of a shovel. [Seriously]( You can throw them in mud, water, dirt, or whatever all day. It will shoot. Hell, I bet some of those AKs in the middle east haven't been oiled in decades. Or ever. You can ban them, regulate them, confiscate them, but you can never get rid of them. The AK is a design. An idea. A brilliantly simple one. It can't be unthought. If you confiscated and destroyed every single AK in one day, some machinist will have a brand new made before lunch the next day. The AK-47 is antifragile. Maybe Mikhail Kalashnikov and Satoshi Nakamoto are more similar than we think.

You know when somebody gets a brand new car and never changes the oil? They wake up one morning with 25,000 miles on the car and don't understand why it won't start. It happens. Even though those people don't know much about cars, you would think they would look into this huge investment and think "how should I take care of this?" No. Apparently, Mark is one of those idiots who has no real concept of necessary maintenance, accountability, taking care of things specially when they aren't yours, or the basic fucking sentience that is required to realize that other people's lives are deeply impacted by his colossal fuck up the likes of which we have never seen before.

No. It's not a question of authenticity. It is a question of morality and judgement. If Satoshi woke up and donated a shit ton of coins out of nowhere, the fear and uncertainty would fuck up every exchange. "We thought he was gone!" "Why now?" "What's to stop him from doing this every time somebody fucks up?" 
It wouldn't be the first time a charitable act has taken place. It would be the first time SATOSHI HAS EVER TOUCHED HIS BITCOINS (I believe he did send one guy a transaction to make sure it worked in 2009 when testing). So that would be a pretty big fucking deal and a game changer. Period. Satoshi knows this. Bitcoin days destroyed charts are relevant and have scared the shit out of people in the past and that was nothing compared to the days destroyed if Satoshi just moved a fraction of a percent of his shit.

Banks can use the blockchain for lots of other things besides bitcoins. I was intentionally vague about the game for potential anonymity reasons but, obviously, I don't really care now. If _IM_SKEPTICAL is still skeptical, then oh well. No sweat off my hairy neck. If your jimmies are rustled you can send me a PM for more proof but it would probably be weird if you cared that much.

I think we can agree to disagree on most of that but the target thing... 40 million users cards were compromised. That doesn't just mean your immediate credit that could be charged back was compromised, but all the data on your card and in the target system. Name, address, you name it. My point is that it is not just the repairable stuff that gets compromised. Credit cards are a huge hole for identity thieves and scammers. With a paper bitcoin wallet, you can have a private key that has never even seen a network let alone another persons eyes. Other things like the hardware wallets coming out completely protect against anything like this.

I was wondering the same thing myself not too long ago. Yes. You will be prompted to put in your encryption password if you have one when you wipe your paper wallet. I know you can specifically on blockchain. 
I actually set up an encrypted paper wallet for a friend. His fiancée made him buy a big item for their new house so he needed the coins for use on overstock. He is very much a noob (bigger noob than you don't worry. Also, you don't sound like a noob)and was able to wipe without a problem. It's pretty self explanatory when you import keys on blockchain.

You may or may not find this as amusing as I did. Not sure how familiar you are with guns. 
A magazine for a gun is essentially a box, a follower to push the rounds up, and a spring. A drunk three year old with sheet metal and a hammer could make a 1911 magazine. 
Anyway, California made it illegal to sell magazines with a capacity over 10 rounds (other states now have stupid similar laws as you may know). The most common magazine for an AR-15 is probably its 30 rounder. Well, an interesting round, the .50 caliber Beowulf, has been chambered in many AR-15 uppers. This round is massive. So big, that its magazine can only hold 10 rounds. What does this magazine look like? I'm glad you asked! It has the *exact* dimensions as the .223/5.56 magazine the AR-15 traditionally takes. So, magazines stamped .50 Beowulf flocked to California. This is what happens when idiots that know nothing about what they ban make the rules.

That's a basic pillar of Keynesian economics. Bitcoin is the experiment that could prove or disprove that. Essentially, if you believe in bitcoin, you are of the Austrian school of thought regarding economics. Keynesians believe bitcoin will suffer from crippling deflation. However, I personally believe it will simply promote smart consumerism. Buy what you need and save what you can. People realize if they don't spend, they don't gain value on what they store. Also, if people don't adopt, the units do not gain value. Spending and adoption are crucial. And I'm pretty surprised at how bitcoin is doing in both of those regards. Spend some. Save some more.

Suppliers of bitcoin? You mean miners? People desperately trying to pay off the hardware that allows them to be a miner? No. 
If by supplier you mean exchanges, they aren't suppliers. But I am not sure exactly who you think a bitcoin "supplier" is. Bitcoin has several open exchanges spread over multiple countries where *individuals* freely trade bitcoin. Also, it is just Bitcoin. Not BitCoin.

IMO, the hard part, for the average person, is to get started. All they have to do is click yes with this idea. Also, their hardware, even if ASIC, is probably obsolete on its own. Collectively, it would have a chance when a newspaper has its own mining pool (to the benefit of the newspaper). I'm imagining simply plugging in the ASIC USB chip, clicking "yes, use my shit," and then you get to cruise through all their content. If you have the USB, you probably won't get any bitcoin on your own. You may get a few cents or dollars if you are lucky with a little block erupter. Then, when you want to see content from somewhere else, give them access to your ASIC. The ASIC doesn't have to be maintained constantly with this because you are mining for others whenever and not yourself all the time. I could go into it more but on my cell phone in class.

I would trust coinbase more than anybody else. It takes 4 days with normal verification to get the coins to you but I have made at least 30 transactions with them and they have always delivered. If you don't trust them with one big transaction, break it up into a few and see how it goes with the first one. I highly recommend coinbase. It is very legit. I buy coins every monday and they get into my wallet every thursday.

There has already been statements and an interview. It is a known characteristic of the protocol and Mt. Gox is set up in a way that makes it slightly vulnerable to such a malicious attempt of double withdrawing. 
So, I see two possibilities as to what is going on.
1) Mt. Gox, the once flagship exchange for bitcoin, has messed up something every other exchange has correctly accounted for or 
2) Mt. Gox is committing fraud. They are lying and saying their car is just having "slight technical difficulties" when, in reality, they are out of gas in the middle of the desert and you are stuck in the backseat. Oh, and they put the child lock on for you.

This guy has a pretty good reputation id read this. (From when I read it a few days ago) he pretty much says "look, I love bitcoin and I was one of the first financial analysts to even write about the damn thing. I think it is great and can take off. However, it is due for a nosedive like it hasn't seen yet and here is the math that I has been right for decades that says so." However, there are a few things here and there about bitcoin that he sees as disadvantages that I always considered advantages and essential for a healthy market. One of those things is altcoins. He thinks they are bad. I think they are good. If gold was the *only* precious metal, I think it wouldn't be healthy for its value. But that is just me.

Bitcoin on gox was artificially high because it was previously seen as the only way to get coins out. That means demand was high for bitcoins on gox. Now, it looks like dollars and bitcoins are on a level playing field of shitty business practice. Demand has gone down for bitcoin because it no longer has that advantage on the exchange. 
So, my theory is that people are kind of panicking and trading for dollars and seeing if it is any easier to get value out that way. That's why the volume is high. And when demand for something is low, prices falls. This exchange needs to die as quickly and painlessly as possible.

These are open exchanges where individuals sell bitcoin. The coins didn't reach this price because the owners of the exchange set the price. It is a completely free market. I think you don't have a grasp of all the fundamentals but that's ok.

@_date: 2014-04-05 08:13:09
Oh I completely understand. Mainly, for me, it helps me remove emotion from my trading. That alone is worth a good bit. It certainly decreases risk and risk certainly swings both ways. Black and red. 
Another thing I do to help put at least a little risk back in is buy when I feel the price dips. Like the gox crash. I bought a lot (for me) at 450 or so then and it went right back up a pretty good bit. So far, it's worked out.

I just didn't know what you meant. I'm talking about currency. Not distance or volume. You need words that aren't much effort. 
Euro dollar quarter nickel penny rupee peso dinar. Words we use for currency are usually very short. Maybe I'm crazy and I haven't gotten any sleep but I would imagine there is a reason for that. 
Satoshi millibitcoin microbitcoin is long. 
I'm not saying multiples of ten suck. I'm saying that using long words to denote a currency sucks.

That's what the escrow is for.. Also the credit card has all of your personal information on it. If somebody gets your card, they get that. Credit card companies can't promise that your stolen information won't get out. All it took was one Russian teenager to steal 40 million credit card users' information from target. 
Either way, all of the things you fault bitcoin for can and will be overcome completely in the future as more infrastructure is put in place. More services will offer protection and very cheaply at that. That's one of the great things about it. It has so much potential for other applications as well as constant innovation. Credit cards are a 50 year old technology. PayPal is its own centralized system that can't have other entities innovate it. Hell, a story that was on the front page today ha a guy getting blackmailed when a hacker posed as a paypal employee and got his credit card number. Bitcoin will have shares of assets and decentralized contracts and loans in the future. PayPal will continue to screw people over by freezing accounts at their will and holding sensitive information in a centralized place. 
Also, the door swings both ways. In certain situations, a charge back from somebody else can screw you over.

It sucks. I took it in school. It is pretty much two languages. You have pinyin (pretty much how you would pronounce it phonetically) and then the characters.

Yup. Times like these, I break it up more. If you want to buy $100 worth, split it up 10 ways. 10 bucks every once in a bit. Spread the risk further.

I'm not aware of any doxxings that ended up in violence but this guy seems to be actively pursuing just that. He's also basically saying "I might be moving soon so hurry up and do something you pussy neckbeards." And this is just what I've gathered from the first page.

Well when you put the most money in, you tend to be the most influential. Thankfully, everybody that wants to has just as much say in bitcoin when it comes to it's core. 
But that's a legitimate worry. However, part of me wants to say that Marc says stuff sometimes to sound like most investors so most investors won't disregard him. If he came out and said "bitcoin will fuck the system  I think he would be laughed at and he knows it. But, that's very unlikely. He's probably pro regulation to an extent. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 03:00:10
I agree. This is decent press for bitcoin and a bunch of people heard about it because of that most likely. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:10:34
Haha yeah. I don't know the details like whether it is open source and what not. I sort of disregarded them as competition because of their reputation crisis and their tendency to never come through. I have way more faith in Trezor and it's very late. I kind of had a hardware wallet idea but I don't want to pursue it if the demand won't be there or won't benefit.

Funny story, I was at a sports game with my family after the Gox crash. During a pause in the action, I showed my Dad the price chart of bitcoin and where I bought in (the bottom) and how it was trading at 570 or whatever at the time. All of the sudden, his friend walks up and they talk. Dad says "Hey, crimdelacrim, you should talk about bitcoin with Mr. So and so." 
Mr. So and so happened to be the president of a large bank. Everybody in the area was now listening. I carefully worded an inquiry about bitcoin because his initial expression led me to believe he knew a bit about it and wasn't too keen. "I don't believe in it. Not at all. It's bad and it's never going to work and it's just a fad." People look from him to me. I smile politely. I had prepared for this. "They said the same thing about email in the 90's." All the old men around laughed. Mr. So and so turned from stoic to agitated. "I don't believe in pawn shops either." I give him a puzzled look because I am trying to work out some bizarre, misinformed connections he has made about bitcoin in his head. I let him know that I am not sure what he meant by that but I assured him that whatever thought just went through his head about bitcoin was incorrect. I explained the services made possible with bitcoin. Services that a bank could certainly use to their advantage if they wanted to cut cost and risk. Anyway, I got a ton of people asking me about bitcoin after the conversation. I didn't see anybody asking Mr. So and so about banking. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:15:56
The number of people willing to sell bitcoin is met with the number of people willing to buy it. The agreed upon value of each coin is around $800. Bitcoin has never had a constant slope of increasing value and never will. Its value will either drop or grow mainly in logarithmic leaps and bounds until it finally reaches a sustaining adoption point. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:27:30
I know and normally I would agree but they are in direct opposition to many political things I am very vocal about. I think this is great what they are doing but there is just no way I would ever let myself pay for something that so shamelessly aligns with the views of corrupt Chicago politicians. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:38:46
I honestly don't know for certain but I could imagine it going down because the shutting down of the exchange would likely produce a lot of doubt in bitcoin. While the supply of coins could go down, so could the faith in bitcoin. 
I also see another scenario similar to the Silk Road being closed. When a shady bitcoin service goes under, bitcoin becomes liberated from its bonds of bullshit and can lead to an increase. I know the closing of gox would eventually benefit bitcoin but I don't know whether or not the price will tank before then. It probably depends on the manner of the closing. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:00:34

Nope. They never said they had that many one day. They only said that number in a document leaked the day of the shut down. They said that was stolen. They never said over what time period. It would have had to have been stolen over a time period of several years. You refuse to do research on this subject and spew FUD.

First part of the article is incorrect. There were other gun stores that took bitcoin at least months ago that I am aware of.

I'm a grad student that uses them every day. It's not about what you or I can remember. It's about saying something easy and catchy. Currency has to be for everybody and you don't need to be an asshole about it. I'm just making a suggestion. You need something quick and colloquial. It doesn't really matter. If bitcoin actually did go mainstream, the general public would come up with their own easier names. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:56:11
If you want them right this second, localbitcoins.com is good but you will pay a premium for them. I use coinbase.com and as of right now have never had a problem with them since I started using them 6 months ago and I use them regularly. Or you can provide a good or service that accepts them. Also, an entire bitcoin is currently $473.82. I would recommend not buying a whole one at first. You can buy a millionth of a pennies worth if you want. Bitcoin is very divisible. I would just buy a few bucks worth at first to get the hang of it. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:36:39
It is true. Well, a ton of people asking me about it after it happened is kind of true. Some people asked and some others listened. I don't think most people knew what to ask and some people probably didn't care but we had 20 minutes to kill during half-time. If I was going to make it up, I would have made Mr. So and so say something better than "I don't believe in pawn shops, either." It just seemed so odd to me and I still can't work out how he was associating bitcoins and pawn shops. Anyway, it happened. I can't prove it but I don't really get anything out of making shit up.

Kind of..I always told myself if I ever did Med school, my practice would be one of my focuses and I would also have another thing. Even if I applied for medical school ASAP, It would be a year and a half before class would start (at the med school here, deadline is in October for the *next* fall) I will have lots of time to do something and I have a few people I know that could make stuff happen. And I have some money. I don't know. I can always wait a few more years, too...Although I am getting older.. I would be starting med school when all of my friends will be practicing or almost practicing.

Bots don't control the price. They just set buy and sell orders for when their parameters are met by the asking prices their operators give them. They are just the extension of their owner's will. Either way, I'm pretty sure most bitcoins are off exchanges and in private wallets. This isn't a closed ecosystem where the exchange owners call the shots. This is as free market.

Nah. When Andreas brought it up after the 2 hour mark, Rogan says "ya I don't know about that I don't know about that." He didn't say we didn't have time. He obviously looked and sounded hesitant about the mere concept of bitcoin on his phone. That put me off a little as well as the Brian Redban guy (the one that didn't understand bitcoin yet NEVER hesitated to attempt to prove Andreas wrong or bring up conspiracy theories and shit) but all in all a pretty good interview I guess. Andreas killed it. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:42:12
I said he mined them (supposedly). He mined 1 million coins and those coins have NEVER been touched. We would know instantly if he did. Have you read *anything* Satoshi has said? You need to read what he said, and a lot of other stuff, before you keep trying to suggest what you are suggesting.

I was told about bitcoin in 2011 and didn't get into it until 2013. I always try to tell myself that no matter when I got in, I will always wish I had gotten into it earlier. So you shouldn't think like that. I currently use coinbase and they have been perfect. Id like to try the one you mentioned. I just buy $10 or $20 worth of bitcoin once a weak and a little more in the dips. That's how I recommend buying but that's just me. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:39:55
Make another copy of the seed. I had a panic moment a few months ago when my Trezor crashed while updating and had to be reset. "Fine" I thought. "I'll just get my seed and everything will be fine" 
Except I couldnt find my seed. I turned my house, my parents house, my grandparents house all upside down looking for the little book I kept the seed in. I finally found it but I was panicking to the point that I was almost physically ill. 
So, just in case of a house fire or something, have a second copy of the seed somewhere else that is secure. Also, your trezor can shit the bed while updating. Mine did and it's a problem other people have had. It's no big deal at all but you have to have the seed.

Ok good. I couldn't make one. But I do have it written down. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 05:20:36
Np. Yes. Multibit HD worked (at least the only one easy enough for me to figure out) out of all the other wallets I tried. I just selected the middle option (restore from seed I believe), follow the prompts, and then let it sync up if you just downloaded it. It did, however, ask for a password which I miraculously remembered after several tries. It wouldn't open otherwise and I had no recollection of having one for mycelium but I guess I did. After probably 20 or 30 minutes of syncing, there my wallet was. Hallelujah. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 01:11:53
Oh thank you. okay i just entered in the words and it says "no password could be recovered for those wallet words." Is it saying I need a password to recover from that seed or that it doesn't have a password? 
edit: I just did restore instead of restore password from seed. After I put in several things, it says there are no backups available for this wallet and asks me to put in a timestamp and do some new passwords. God I hope this isn't as bad as it sounds.

@_date: 2013-12-16 02:42:55
To be honest, when I first heard about bitcoin in 2009 I didn't understand it and I thought it would put me on some list because of Silk Road. Now, I have bitcoin and I'm probably on plenty of lists anyway. The way my friend described it to me in 2009 also made it sound like a pain in the ass to use when it really wasn't. I should have done my own research.

Ha very true. I was just pointing out the similarity. Naturally, the situation is not 100% comparable. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:41:52
It's also pretty much instant. If you don't have your cc set up at coinbase and verified id, this is the fastest, anonymous way to buy bitcoin easily. I bought $50 worth at 520 on coinbase but 590 on local bitcoin. Coinbase has taken over a week to give me my first bitcoins I purchased with them so I couldn't use them to buy when it was low. Still don't regret paying a premium and then they surpassed even my premium price later that night. Now, that high price, I'm sure some crazy person bought a small part of a bitcoin at 1000 or so just to get into it and that came up as the price it was trading at. That's my guess.

Its inherent design is worth something in my opinion. That is, with the way sending money to people right now works, it is worth something just to buy bitcoin, send it, and have the receiver trade it for cash. I worked somewhere with a money sending service. Just the ability to do this has worth. Even if a bitcoin is 50 cents, It is nice to send somebody 50 bucks without a fee. So, even if it isn't much, I think it is something. But I have a suspicion that even if it sinks soon, it probably wont sink to nothing. At least not right now. I am brand new to bitcoin though so don't listen to me.

I hope it is this low when I wake up so I can go and make a direct deposit buy. Very interested to see what happens while we sleep. I just bought my first bitcoins yesterday. Glad I just put $30 in.

The only way I see one getting more steam is if it offers a good incentive to join. For instance, if the process of mining were somehow used to solve genetic sequence problems and do stuff like cure cancer or complex physics problems (I dunno, supercomputer stuff) while they are also processing transactions, then people could get behind that but I don't know. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:28:40
Ah. Boner. Thank you. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:43:57
Ah. I just didn't see anything much about it when I searched. It seems like it is a pretty serious crisis but I am new so maybe it isn't. If bitcoin ever gets to the kind of acceptance we dream it will, isn't this blockchain going to be a terabyte before we know it? 
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:32:00
Ah. Yes. Well, I'll be doing the same. Thanks for that. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:13:34
can you use that wallet file with other services or does it have to be electrum? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:20:02
I agree. Seriously, do we think this is never going to happen again or that another government isn't going to pass laws against bitcoin? It should be obvious that they will. That should be part of the plan. Bitcoin is supposed to frustrate governments and get them to flail to try to control something they really can't.

I am new too but you need to read the sidebar, bro. Also, create wallets anywhere you need. It is easy and can come in handy when you need to go to a certain place to trade coins quickly.

I'm just going to buy a little every Monday and see what happens. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:06:41
how quickly can you find a person on average? I am afraid not many in my region use bitcoin :(
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:12:37
Yes. However, he claims that he isn't sure where many of his bitcoins are. That is, when he first bought his bitcoins, he used several wallets and he isn't sure how much he has lost access to. So, maybe he helps further deflate it as a currency. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:46:53
I bought yesterday. You will make more than me if that makes you feel better. (I'd say yes. Buy in if I were you.) 
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:57:05
Thank you very much. I have not heard much about this pruning in my research. That is what I was looking for. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:07:51
What if they had an escrow feature? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:05:41
I had trouble myself. Try direct deposits on local bitcoins. It took me about 10 minutes at a large bank and I had my first bitcoin. Too bad they just got cut in half in value. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:42:13
I heard about it initially but never got into it. So, ya, I may lose some initially but I'm going to try to build some up and use it. I've decided to put ten or twenty bucks in every Monday and just see what happens. It's worth it just for entertainment value IMO. So, I might be newly subbed. It doesn't mean all new subs are lost I would hope. At least not if you want this currency to keep taking off. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:54:49
Awesome. I feel dumb. Thank you very much. Is it easy to back up to a flash drive? Does the flash drive need to be big enough for the blocks? 
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:38:25
Make a somewhat large initial buy then just buy a little once a week. I buy every Monday unless it takes a dip. Then I just buy more. I have two main wallets that act as checking and savings. I recommend this. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:20:39
Ok thanks for all the help. Compatibility between stuff is probably my biggest grey area so to say. That, and actually finding somebody in my area that sells bitcoins ha. My banking information is at my parents house. I am probably going to end up doing a money order tomorrow.

Yes. and it could be 1TB the next year. I mean, I have several online nodes now that I have set up with a few websites so I could just keep it there. That isn't the point though. People need to be able to download this blockchain and keep their bitcoins local. I feel it is an important advantage of bitcoin that is a good selling point when trying to bring in more users. Bitcoin is losing that advantage exponentially. I just haven't felt I have seen much discussion (a little, but not a lot) on this but I am probably looking in the wrong places...

China. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:32:41
Depends on country. Apparently in America, to start a bitcoin ATM, there are several hoops that must be jumped through. For instance, they make you get a HUGE insurance policy. It's all to keep the little guy out so the established money makers don't get any challengers. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:32:17
As somebody coming into it new, this was my general understanding of it. When explaining it to my gf, I said it is like money because of x, gold because y, my computer is the jeweler and now imagine if you could use Wonkavision with gold (instead of chocolate) and you could send it anywhere in the world for free instantly. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:32:49
From what little news I have found on it lately, the blockchain is growing and fast. It looks like it has gained about a gig a month. Can something be done? I just don't think a 20 gig block chain is going to be very advantageous when trying to reel in more bitcoin users. Again, this is my first time with bitcoin. I may be talking out of my ass but this is surely a PITA. 
The past 14 weeks of blockchain are going to take me the same amount of time to download and verify as the rest of the entire blockchain. It seems like it has doubled in data in the past few months. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:21:48
Nah. Im in the same boat (I live in Mississippi). Check out the buy online people. What you do is click buy with one of them and it will send you to their account information and local bitcoin will take their bitcoins and hold them until you pay them. Once you pay, the bitcoins' previous owner will click the release button and they will leave the local bitcoin "escrow" they call it. If you are close to a chase bank or western union, you can do this in minutes. Just try to find somebody that uses a bank near you. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:47:07
well, I have a few wallets. I want one I can back up physically. Doesn't that require a local download of the blockchain?
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:09:31
Man, thanks again. I really appreciate it. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:52:07
I'd say keep your big chunk saved in a back up or paper wallet or what have you and then have a smaller amount for trading and keep that in an online wallet or two. Enough to buy stuff with but not enough to cry over if the site goes down for a bit, etc. that is my plan at least and I am very new to all of this. Once a week or month, put a little more in your main savings wallet an back it up again. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:42:50
If they fight back, there won't be anything moderate about it. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:31:45
please disregard what I said. Another user just filled me in. I assumed that your wallet.dat file was required to use a local wallet and that you couldn't use that file with an SPV. My apologies. However, I still think the space necessary for the blockchain is too damn high. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:45:06
The stickiest of the icky. Want to smoke with your old boy; Rick James? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:03:10
Yes, I know. But in order to use that dat file, don't you have to get somewhere with a wallet and blockchain to move your money again? 
edit: also, I am 24 hours into this blockchain processing. Not stopping now. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:07:40
Actually not a bad question. I am new myself and I am constantly told don't even try. "You will be lucky to break even." However, I am interested in the numbers behind it. Exactly how difficult is it now, how difficult is it going to be, and why?

@_date: 2013-12-09 08:38:11
Can I ask a quick, stupid question?
Ok, so you can generate random addresses on bitaddress. Is each one that appears before you "burned" so to say? As in, the website will not generate it again for another user? Or is it possible two people can generate the same wallet address and attempt to use it? 
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:36:06
Well, get a gun. Get a few. They want to control those, too. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:16:56
