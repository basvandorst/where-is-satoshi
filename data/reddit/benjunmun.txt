My feelings on this is that while it's critical that we have the option to fork, a fork is much more a political move than a technical move. Even in the open source world, forks are frequently related to a contentious change or conflict in leadership. Part of the process of forking is a fight for user base and mindshare. 
When you take this and apply it to bitcoin, I see two things. First of all, we've got political issues that weren't able to be resolved. Bitcoin gives us distributed technology, but no guidance on distributed decision making. We've still got to figure that one out. 
Secondly, we're dealing with money. Even people who are not strictly speculators may have a large amount of current value at stake. And part of that value comes directly from the size and involvement of the user base. So it's not surprising to me that potential fragmentation of that user base is going to cause even more conflict than usual.
Personally I'm still excited for the potential of bitcoin, but I think we've got a lot of work beyond the pure technology to build stable, distributed governance. Forking may be an integral part of that process but I doubt it will ever be a friendly event.

As a counterpoint for you, here's why I like and don't like spending my bitcoins online.
* Lack of chargebacks - I need to be able to trust you. There's a lot of sketchy companies - especially the ones that deal purely in bitcoin. If you are an established retailer, this isn't as much of a problem. It's nice if I have the option of conducting my first transaction with you using a credit card to build trust.
* Ease of obtaining coins. I have a few from the mining days, and it's getting easier every day, but fundamentally I'm not getting paid in bitcoins, and there are going to be transaction fees just to turn my salary into bitcoins. This eats into the bottom line of pricing.
* You can pass on part of that savings on transaction fees. Who doesn't like lower prices.
* I've got what feels to me like a bunch of 'free' money - If I can spend it on things that I need or want, I definitely will.
* Secure transactions - none of this 'verified by visa' password crap. I know that at its absolute worst, I can only lose the money that I'm trying to send you. It's impossible to compromise my account by sending you money.
* Honestly, it's still new and cool to be sending you money from my computer.
* Anonymity isn't a huge point of contention to me, but making it that much harder for payment companies to collect and sell my personal profile is a bonus. Protection of personal information can definitely be a selling point for many of us though.

Nothing like [classical]( cryptography!

I just got some gold! I really appreciated the instant verification. Does anyone know how Coinbase handles that? I guess reddit gold is a special case of product in that it can be revoked if the transaction falls through later on.
