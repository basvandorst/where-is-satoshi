Something about how many btc he holds. Sounds cooler to say 10 mill club than to say 'i bought 1.2 btc"

Kraken is very good and rated as one of the exchanges with best security. Agreed is was bad in 2017 but they done a lot of work since then and the CEO is very active on reddit when problem happens.
If you read the thread about the user being kicked you would also know that we were not told the full story. The CEO made a respons to that specific case.

I'm in the same spot. If I tell my family they will think i'm crazy. I would rather tell them I have a gambling addiction than let them know I deal with internet money.

You sound surprised? We know people move into stable coins when market goes down.

A lot of us believe but it still can fail big time. High risk maybe high returns
