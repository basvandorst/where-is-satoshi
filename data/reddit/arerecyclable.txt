i wonder what portion of the demand for bitcoin actually uses bitcoin on a semi-regular basis. surely the people who are left over after the speculative investors leave will be those who actually use bitcoin. is there any way to gather data on how many transactions each wallet issues? [i've never actually had bitcoin myself :( ]

if the price begins to settle, do you think a lot of the new speculative investors will begin to cash out and prices will drop?

solid advice. diversify it up a little bit, take some out to make life easier now, and let the rest continue to grow.

how do you even get the ball rolling when you are 20k in the hole? i mean, i'd like to think i'm pretty business minded, but student debt doesn't pay itself off. i mean, you can say i was stupid for incurring that debt in the first place, but i was 17 when i made the decision to go to school and i now have a pretty decent job. need to start

thing i hate about some crypto subs is all the circle jerking. if you express any doubt people will shit on you. the truth as we all know it is that the price is indeed highly inflated due to all the speculative investment. if the only people who bought coin were people who used it to make purchases, there would be a whole lot less volume. i'm not trying to say that a bubble will pop, but the concerns that these 'experts' have are indeed based in reality. yet people just wana say they're all just fuckin idiots.
if we can make bitcoin more useful in every day life, we will be ensuring it's resistance to a negative situation snowballing.

i think this all hinges upon bitcoin actually become something we use daily, and would rather hold than say USD. could see this happening if governments becomes tyrannical, but due to unstable nature of the currency, USD is much better for day to day transactions.
perhapse bitcoin will go up to 200k.. however it isn't wrong to say that it is inflated. and i mean that in a definitional sense, not trying to be derogative. 
fact is, it is almost purely bid up by speculative investors. but even then, who's to say it will ever come to an end? perhaps it will grow indefinitely.... unless there's some kind of crisis or giant hack that makes people wary of the currency.
decentralization and anonymity are attractive features, however it gets tricky when you try to asses the 'value'. really, the value of bitcoin is almost purely based on 'buy it, it will go up' .. but since there is no underlying company, profits, or other way to value the currency, i don't necessarily see people coming to the eventual conclusion that 'hey this is overvalued we should all sell'.. like in the dotcom or housing bubbles.

people who play the lottery are a pretty irresponsible bunch to begin with. statistically speaking.

depending where you live, 300k could be the cheapest house you can get. although it seems like they don't have much preventing them from moving considering OPs business is probably largely online.

inspiring. i'd love to do the same, working on paying my student debts as quickly as possible so i can start. only shitty thing is that housing (especially duplex) is super fucking expensive where i live. might be able to get a duplex for around the 500k you got a tri for. still, would be miles better than renting.
