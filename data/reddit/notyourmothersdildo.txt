You need an exchange if you want erc 20 tokens to be used. Even services like Shapeshift use exchanges in the background and charge fees.

You are wise in the ways of porn and bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:23:36
MetArt's sites have been taking bitcoin for 6 months or more -- we fetch live exchange rates and you pay the exact amount you would as if you used a credit card.
**Manwin charging you double is fucking ludicrous**. It works out better for us as there are no chargebacks or fraud to deal with and the processing fee is 1%, its CHEAPER for us if you use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-19 20:14:55
We take our exchange rates from BitPay and GoCoin now and they are updated every minute. So if you see a point where they don't match the BTC price you see on another site, that is just the intraday swings.
We only ask you for the exact same you'd pay in fiat, we are definitely not charging more for using BTC like Manwin's sites!  And see below where the discount btc link was posted.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:40:04
Thanks! Here at MetArt we've been BTC supporters since the beginning (two people here have mined since when it was in the $0.10 range).
On all of our signup forms, we pull live exchange rates and charge the exact amount you would normally pay. Actually the page you linked to is a discount rate over normal membership prices -- cheaper with BTC!
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:47:13
MC/Visa have certain numbers you have to stay under each month or your merchant accounts can be cancelled. I think it is like 1.2% or something?  So you always have to be vigilant on chargebacks, yes. 
Adult site memberships can be a regretful purchase for some people so they will try and stick it to us the next day by saying it wasn't them who ordered that pornography!  Legit chargebacks also happen from stolen card data.
edit: I should point out that you never have to chargeback on a MetArt site -- just write to support the next day and they will refund the charge if you weren't satisfied.
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:30:01
Hahah these are the exact same people who chargeback online porn, I'm sure.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:55:33
The guy in the GFY link is an idiot and his data is horrible. We will continue to accept Bitcoin (and now Litecoin):
@_date: 2014-02-19 20:13:34
We update our BTC exchange rates every minute!  You pay the exact same amount as you would with fiat.
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:35:17
If you use a credit card, you cost us anywhere from 6% to 11% in transaction fees!  Bitcoin costs us 1%. 
It is a no brainer for us; the only negative is the lack of recurring subscriptions.

I'm sure you remember a few months back when an outage to S3 in US-East-1 brought down dozens of unrelated AWS services across all regions, right?

This has got to be one of the dumbest posts in the history of reddit since stonetear asked how to modify an email server.
@_date: 2013-04-27 21:55:45
Great when you have the attention of people looking for a place to spend the coins they already have ... But slower with normal users since it is such a pain in the ass to fund a wallet. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 23:32:38
It should be!  It just has to be simpler for first time users. In the best case scenario, it would take you 8 to 12 hours to get bitcoins (installing bitcoin-qt then buying some locally for cash), but for many people that fund through a remote service, it can take days or even a week or more.
That is a lot to ask when someone wants to jerk it right now. You have to plan ahead for your porn purchase when (I'm just guessing here) porn buying is mostly an impulse buy. So we're trying to turn an impulse buy into a transaction that can take a week or more to happen if the person doesn't already have coins... that is tough.
For a fetish or kink website where you don't want any record of it on a card, that anonymity factor would be more driving... but for us, we're about as vanilla as you can get on the softcore sites we have.
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:30:31
Yes, that is a very appropriate fix.
@_date: 2013-04-28 23:35:18
But the ads they show sell something. The ads mostly lead to subscription sites they also run. (Manwin; tubes -&gt; brazzers)
@_date: 2013-04-30 06:02:38
They flagged us recently for a video where a guy woke a girl up for sex... like she was sleeping, then he woke her up, and they had consensual relations. Idiots didn't even watch it to see, they just saw someone sleeping and said take it down.
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:59:35
It is a great match.  Bitcoin's anonymity and freedom from credit card rebills combined with the adult industry's lack of quality billers.
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:13:03
This can work.
Link them to bitpay and coinbase.
@_date: 2013-04-30 06:01:18


Why wouldn't you expect to do that?  How else would they know what you are actually selling?
@_date: 2013-04-27 16:19:05
We've been accepting btc for almost two weeks now (MetArt). Before us a few smaller fetish sites were but coming up next week another major site will announce they are taking them, too.
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:13:38
Our softcore nude art sites are MetArt, Erotic Beauty, Errotica Archives, Michael Ninn and Rylsky Art.
The one site that includes masturbation and some more kink is The Life Erotic.
Beyond that are the sites that include hardcore like SexArt, Viv Thomas, the classic ALS Scan (fetish, peeing, insertion, etc)
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:06:11
Stolen isn't the only issue, it is dishonest people who will buy the coins and chargeback with the bank. They will get refunded and you are out your coins.
smeggletoot knows what he is talking about.

Good points for sure, but unfortunately we can't control what is on the BitPay invoice.  The affiliate ID doesn't actually pass through their system, it is stored in our Order table. The order ID is passed through BitPay so when we receive the order confirmation, we can do the affiliate credit based on that record.
You probably know our affiliate managers so you can contact them if you have questions about payouts and such but I'm also happy to help you run a test since you probably have some bitcoin yourself. If you want to do a test transaction with your  I can credit you back the bitcoin you spend to your aff account after we verify the order went through. Send a PM if you want.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:06:40
I'm the CTO?  We added it over the weekend and good news, your aff code already works. Use refer.ccbill.com &amp;html= them to the /bitcoin/ page for now. Payouts will be weekly (through CCBill in USD).  You have the scoop, no other affiliate knows this.

You're overlooking the fact that there is no need to build forum software from the ground up. Any attempt to do so will likely allow for security holes somewhere along the way that have already been eliminated in commercial software like vBulletin.
Why would you write something from scratch? It really is a ridiculous amount of money to be holding to develop a new forum.
@_date: 2013-04-19 13:13:42
Would you open source it? Or you're proposing you want to license it from them?
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:37:45
We might have some of our partners like ATK and Nubiles available using BTC in the next few days.
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:39:05
Anyone who signs up through reddit, send me a PM and I'll send you a free month to another one of our sites of your choice.
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:18:37
Integration on the main join forms is in progress. I can't guarantee the price will stay so cheap once it gets there.
There is no automatic recurring with btc but we might send you an email reminder once you're about to expire.
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:17:21
You can use pre-paids with us through (unfortunately) CCBill.
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:36:57
I'm sending you a free month of SexArt (one of the MetArt sites). Check it out!
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:19:04
Have you checked out SexArt?  Send me a PM for a free month.
@_date: 2013-09-22 13:04:34
We've been accepting bitcoin for months!  We were the first major site to do so.
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:18:31
No problem; it is coming soon on the main join forms of all sites.
@_date: 2013-04-28 23:36:30
Hey, did you signup with btc?  Drop me a PM and pick another site for a free month.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:15:23
This is a good point, I'll see if we can get the exact exchange rate on the final pages and show both USD and BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-30 06:03:37
Make it easier for ordinary people to fund a wallet and porn will follow.
