Yeah I think this whole thread is evidence of people's mental inability to process any reality besides the current one. Look at the Republicans' argument against raising minimum wage. "These jobs were never meant to be able to support someone working fulltime, they are temporary jobs." Guess what assholes? Line cooks and janitors USED to be able to earn a middle class living. It wasn't glamorous, but they could save up money, buy a home, own a decent car or two. That was back when the wealthiest among us paid their fair share.

Agreed. I know I live in a bubble. I was playing League of Legends with this 20-something kid I know the other night and he started prodding a bit for some reason. He asked “So do you make like, $100,000 a year?” And I started laughing. He assumed wrong and said “oh yeah, that’s a lot”. I said “dude I wouldn’t get out of bed in the morning for that salary”
To be fair, in my early 20s that seemed like a lot of money. Low six figures is just enough to be comfortable in any major metro area. 
And to expound on your real world example; We’re corresponding over a medium that runs on software. If you’re here using the Internet and you see software devs as “rich”, why not learn to write software? Every resource you need is freely available. People like me are happy to volunteer time helping you learn. Seriously, one of my greatest pleasures in life is mentoring junior devs.

But I'm less concerned with IT automation (nobody's been put out of a job because of me, usually they just learn a new skill that makes them more marketable - if they're willing to learn), and more concerned with automation of the sorts of jobs available to the people we're talking about.

As someone who has been involved in open source software for years no, you still don't get it.
Bitcoin has already had and patched major security flaws with no blockchain rollback or threat to the integrity of the network. Other coins that have been attacked (Ethereum) use your model, and they cannot make that claim. 
There are clear, real world examples that disprove everything you are claiming.
Thing about open source software is that there is always some clever asshole like me just waiting to ream you over minor deviations from an agreed-upon style guide when you make commits. Nevermind when you try to introduce security flaws. You want the best, most secure software in the world? Make it open source and controlled by no one person.

Fair enough. Granted we rejected a base blocksize increase that would have put us in line with 8mb blocks from a resource usage perspective. 
But I'm going to add something here, because I think you're slightly confused. You're not entirely wrong, but the blocksize increase is only "effective" as you've said. SegWit is more like compression than a blocksize increase. We've increased the tx throughput capacity *without* increasing blocksize. Blocks are still 1MB and there are the same number being generated as before since the block target time is the same. Where you are right is there's no such thing as a free lunch, and the witness data still have to be included somewhere.

It's the difference in psychology between a trader and investor. There are pros and cons to each. Trading takes a lot of time. A LOT of time. It will consume your life if you let it. When your cash is sitting in a losing position, as a trader, there is an opportunity cost to every day it sits. Most traders seek to open and close positions in a matter of days. Day traders specifically look to be in and out of a position within a single day (definition of day trader, makes less sense with Crypto since the markets never close - much easier to measure when they are only open a few hours a day). Swing traders look to do overnight trades. Volatility is a trader's friend, so it's unsurprising we're seeing so many in the crypto space.

You're wrong. You can be a libertarian socialist, or an anarcho-socialist. It is possible to be a socialist and also not believe in centralized government. The key is whether it is compulsory or voluntary. Anarcho-syndicalists are extremely far left in terms of today's politics, but we have more in common with Libertarians than with Liberals.
You are conflating the axes of the political compass. You mentioned the Left &lt;-&gt; Right continuum but left out the North &lt;-&gt; South, which is Libertarianism vs. Authoritarianism. 
For example, here's where I fall in the spectrum: 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:14:49
I have a couple GPU rigs (one nvidia - 4x GTX 1080 TI and 2x GTX 1080; one AMD - 6x RX Vega 56), and a few ASIC miners (mostly AntMiner D3s - so x11 algo).
I don't usually have them all mining at the same time lately, because I just kind of hang out on the altcoin announcement forum on bitcointalk and start hashing on whatever seems promising.
Profit wise...well most of them I do fine and make about the same as I would have mining a more popular coin like ZCash or Monero. Sometimes I do REALLY well. I hit the jackpot on Polis (probably a coin you've never heard of - unsurprising) a couple weeks ago when someone pumped it on some shithouse exchange. It takes patience and research, but you can make out very well.

Why would it need to close the channel? Unless the coffee shop is paying its bills in BTC, it can just use the same Lightning channel to send BTC to its payment processor who converts it to fiat. Yes, if you want the balance to settle into your cold wallet then you need to close the channel, but why would they do this?
If you've held BTC for a while, you probably transferred it from a legacy address to a SegWit address (a while ago if you were smart). How much have you transferred out of that SegWit address? Your new Lightning channel will be just like your SegWit address. It's your new wallet. There is no need to close the channel.

Actually isn't bad. The fastest, but also hardest way to get good with security is to learn to write code. If you're looking to actually do it for a living you need to learn to exploit vulnerable systems (it's a legitimate skill, there's a need for competent pentesters), which means having some way to acquire 0days, whether through contacts or figuring them out yourself. Though to be fair, most places I've been to are vulnerable to exploits that are months or even years old.
Anyway if all you want is a layman's primer then it's the basic
* Use strong passphrases (I prefer passphrases to passwords, see: 
* Don't accept attachments or click links from strangers anywhere (email, skype, whatsapp, whatever)
* Keep your OS up to date with security patches
* If in doubt, run antivirus (Especially if using Windows) 
* Don't just click accept and bypass the warning for SSL certificate mismatches. 
When your browser warns you about an SSL cert, it might mean that someone has hijacked your connection and is now sitting between you and the rest of the Internet, which is called a "man in the middle" attack (MITM). Your attacker would be able to do a number of nasty things that he shouldn't be able to do, like steal the login details for your bank account.
I don't always advocate running AV as a matter of course. Not everyone needs it. I open lots of dodgy executables to run a debugger on them and try to reverse engineer them, but I do it in a VM. Spectre-like catastrophes aside, that's pretty safe.
Anyway I think it's more interesting to learn what makes a password strong, how cryptography works, etc.

Nope but it’s not a stock, it’s sound money. None of them “get it”, which is why I haven’t set any of them up with the ability to exchange it. I would if they asked, but I would make sure they understand that the reason I use bitcoin has nothing to do with the market price. For me, it’s about storing my money securely in a way that allows no one to restrict my access to it. I am better with security than the clowns at these banks.

If you record your seed on your computer and it gets owned (and if you’re running Windows, it probably already is), anyone can use your 2FA. I know I record the seeds for 2FA, though I encrypt them at rest. If you lose your phone or get a new one, you might be fucked without your seeds. Yes, your authenticator may get backed up but never rely on just one backup that someone else controls (like the backup functionality of your phone - you do not control it unless you’ve rooted your phone and I would not trust it).

No, it’s called pragmatism. I’m an Anarchist too. I want voluntarism and the absence of hierarchy. That doesn’t mean I don’t participate in the existing political process.
And none of this is really incompatible with Anarchism or Libertarianism. People should have privacy, governments should not. State secrets are a bullshit concept. Public officials need to be accountable to the public. I would never run for office. My political beliefs notwithstanding, I know that I would be giving up quite a lot of privacy by running for office. Not nearly enough as it should be, mind you. Your life should be an open book when you want to make laws that affect a bunch of other people. HIPAA, financial privacy laws; None of it should apply to you once you are elected to public office. We the people should know everything - from what genetic diseases you are prone to, to how many people you've fucked, to what stock you have in your 401k. That's the price you pay for holding power over others in a free society. Or it should be.

Perhaps I'm missing something, but how does one manipulate the price downwards by *buying* asks?


I've always wondered whose money I'm taking when I trade. Thanks for showing me.
They can absolutely manipulate the price downwards. By *selling* BTC that they already own. Or buying out the order book to the extent you suggested and selling enough BTC at a loss to hopefully cause a tidal wave of triggered stops. Then they can buy back cheap and ride the wave of short squeezes after collecting on their short positions in the futures market. If I had control over the capital, that is probably what I would suggest.

8MB blocks are not really too heavy for most people who don't live in poverty, you're right. The problem is that we're not trying to scale to the level of 50 or so txes per second (which is what 8mb blocks enable). We're trying to scale to the level of VISA, which would incur 32GB blocks. You cannot solve an exponential scaling problem by scaling linearly. It's not just wasteful, it's counter-productive. This is basic, freshman-level computer science. Second layer solutions *are* simple and elegant. Blockchains themselves are much less simple and elegant than the second layer solutions being proposed. Simplicity and elegance is not part of the appeal or value proposition of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is really fucking complicated. With the opinion you've expressed, I sincerely doubt you understand how bitcoin works on a technical level at all.

Most miners who do it professionally (myself included) have their own stratum server or a similar setup that will do the math on its own and switch all their hash power to whatever is most profitable to mine. I don't control (or care) whether my ASICs mine BTC or BCH or Peercoin or whatever, at the end of the day all I see is more BTC in my wallet.
Miners are mercenaries, and this is a good thing. The Bitcoin protocol was designed to have every actor acting in his own economic best interest. If every actor involved does this, and Bitcoin somehow fails, then that's that. The Bitcoin experiment will have been a failure.

He was going both long and short on leverage. When you use leverage, your brokerage/exchange will automatically close your position when you run out of money to fund it. That is why it is a big boy's game for experienced traders with serious risk management skills. You need to watch your positions like a hawk when you're trading on leverage, set tight trailing stops and go into it with a plan and STICK TO THAT PLAN. Most importantly, you must be a cold, emotionless beast every time you look at those positions.
What you've got to remember is that experienced professionals who have been doing this for decades sometimes lose. You might even be a genius, but you're swimming with the sharks. And sharks don't care how book smart you are.

Disclaimer: I'll try to play devil's advocate because every opposing viewpoint I have read so far has been factually wrong in very critical, fundamental ways. My take is going to be biased because I have a strong technical background and I understand how Lightning works.
Some people think that Lightning nodes will be a form of centralization. The reason this is not an issue is because Lightning is still trustless. Lightning nodes cannot act preferentially because lightning txes are anonymous.
I have heard other arguments but they were so bad they don't bear repeating. My guess is either poorly-informed people or people trying to intentionally spread FUD.
If you really want an informed opinion, bottom line is you can't trust anyone else. You need to dig into the tech, understand how it works, and then form your own opinion. Just keep in mind that most videos you watch or articles you read are going to explain things in terms of actors taking actions (Alice opens a Lightning channel with Bob...etc), whereas in practice, your client is going to do all of that for you and it's abstracted by software. You should still strive to understand how the technology works. But then that's my bias showing. I want to understand how everything works. There is literally nothing I do not approach with an attitude of curiosity.
EDIT: Because I'm procrastinating right now I will mention one of the bad arguments I mentioned earlier and address it. I have seen some people post or imply in this subreddit that Lightning nodes would somehow fall under KYC/AML. TOTAL nonstarter. Literally impossible by design. A lightning node knows nothing about who is sending or receiving the transactions that it forwards. Furthermore, no single government, or even a large collection of them, could succeed in pursuing and shutting down the entirety of "rogue" lightning nodes around the world, anymore than it could succeed in shutting down all the bitcoin nodes. Bitcoin is global.

It’s much riskier than “virtually a sure thing”. Another crash is just a matter of time. The stock market runs on boom/bust cycles of around 8-10 years, and all the major indicators of an impending crash look worse than they did in 2007. 
There’s going to be another liquidity crisis, but this time the public sector won’t have the liquidity to step in and prop up the private sector like it did in 2008.

Pay them to clean up the parks or whatever. Ok, sure.

I have always been skeptical of chart analysis and TA trading. You know what though? It works because people believe it does. When you have firms employing legions of analysts whose only job is to look at and make meaningful predictions from chart data, the price is going to follow those predictions most of the time. Because those firms are massive market participants, and they're all looking at the same charts, they'll be right more often than they're wrong.
We are getting there with Bitcoin. That is what things like futures markets tend to do. We now have a lot of "experts" backed by lots of money making price predictions. Just be skeptical of the source and ask yourself "Who does this guy work for? Who benefits if he's right? Who benefits if he's wrong?"
You also have to think of this from a slightly different perspective. If your chart analysis showed that Bitcoin should be worth $10,000 today, but it's trading for $11,000, that doesn't mean your analysis was wrong. It just means that it is the wrong price point for you to enter a position. If it were instead trading for $9,000, you would know it's on sale and it would be a perfect time to enter a position. Forecasts are not necessarily a prediction of what the market value *will* be, but what it *should* be. That is how people make money trading on charts.

Trading is more akin to gambling than investing. The difference for me is that gambling involves random chance and investing still involves chance (otherwise there's no risk), but it's less random and an investment is driven by a thesis. To me, a good thesis is something like "Given the previous quarter's profits vs. where the stock is trading, I think this stock is undervalued in the long term". A bad thesis is something like "I drew fibonacci spirals on a chart and it said this stock is going up 10x next week".
I think gambling is hard to define. Betting on a sporting event is gambling, because you have no control over the outcome. But then playing poker is also gambling, but you do have some control over the outcome.

I agree with you in principle, but my background in computer science leads me to point out the fact that the amount of processing power devoted to the Bitcoin network is important. The reason is because of the processing power sitting on the sidelines. If ASICs had never been developed, an entity with enough computing power (like the NSA) would be able to disrupt (read: rewrite the blockchain) the network at its whim. As it stands, the Bitcoin network has more computing power than all of the supercomputers in the world combined. This is an important security feature. I agree that SHA-256 is not the best algorithm to solve this problem, and ASIC-resistance is a desirable feature.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:41:09
Miners never store shit. WTF are you smoking. In fact SHA-256 is so light on memory that you don’t really even need any RAM to hash it, just some fast cache. I think you are confusing miners with node operators. Full nodes store the whole blockchain and the network cannot function without them, but they do so at their owners’ expense with no compensation other than the knowledge that you are participating in Bitcoin. If you are not running a node you have no voice and are not participating in bitcoin.

So route through another node. No "single node" can reject your transaction with LN either. Provided there is any single node out there willing to open a channel with you, it can route all of your payments anonymously to the rest of the network. It would require cooperation from every node on the network to censor you, which is even more censorship-resistant than on-chain. On-chain, you can be censored if only 51% of nodes agree to censor you. In LN, it would require 100% participation to censor you. A single node willing to transact with you is all it takes to be uncensored.

Well, I have about 140 TH going on the main BTC chain and I have no intention of ever shutting down my miners or switching chains. I can't speak for everyone else. I consider SHA-256 to be completely different from other algorithms. On other algos, I'm a mercenary because I don't care about shitcoins. On SHA-256, I mine bitcoin and will always do so because it is king and I prefer to keep it that way. It is the most robust, battle-hardened, secure network that currently exists in the world today.
Also, consensus refers to what nodes agree to, not miners. Miners have no control over consensus (you might be conflating consensus with a 51% hashrate attack, but they are different).
The fact of the matter is we need second layer solutions, and Lightning is a strong candidate. We have an exponential scaling problem, and Big Blockers think we can solve it by scaling linearly. You would be told what a stupid idea that is in a freshman-level computer science course. It's worse than useless, it's actively harmful. Because of what I mentioned above regarding nodes and Nakamoto Consensus.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:20:20
There are a number of projects that have basically tried that idea, of paying nodes. Many of the solutions discussed in this space are being tried or have been tried on other projects. Right now, coins using so-called "masternodes" are getting popular. You have to have some minimum amount of coin to run a masternode, but masternodes collect the majority of staking rewards. The idea is that the network is boostrapped by PoW and then gradually migrates to PoS over time, with the masternodes being a sort of centralization, but that risk is mitigated by the fact that they are all major stakeholders in the success of the network by definition (as they are all sitting on a mountain of coin).

The only longterm fix for that is ASIC-resistance. Unfortunately SHA-256 is a design flaw of Bitcoin. But when bigger players get into ASIC chip fabrication, we will see some help here.
Though to be honest we don't need to "compete" with Chinese miners. I'm mining BTC profitably with my ASICs here in a nice part of the United States. I negotiated 7 cents per kWh with the electric company, and I have those prices locked in for several more years. It is absurdly profitable to mine if you can get your hands on ASICs or GPUs. Admittedly difficult right now, but not outside the reach of your average middle class American. You can start up a decent mining operation for as little as a few grand. You just have to find a source in China for your hardware, or vastly overpay and push out your ROI window.

Yes, if you wanted to get BTC out of your channel and into a legacy-style wallet you would have to issue an on-chain tx. Just like what you have to do to transfer BTC from one wallet to another now. Theoretically, it will be much cheaper to do on-chain txes than it is now due to decreased on-chain tx volume.

It’s tough to expand because miners solve the problem, nodes verify it. The whole thing is based around P vs NP. That is, the idea that some problems are very hard for a computer to solve, but easy for a computer to verify. The miner would be the one in this case who wrote the number originally. But he would have derived that number by doing some kind of work that is hard to do, but easy to verify as having been done.

It only affects video card prices, and usually not the ones you would use for gaming. Right now, the only video card in high enough demand from miners to significantly change supply (and therefore price) is the RX Vega series. It's pretty easy to find cheap Nvidia cards (though nvidia rigs have become popular - as long as you're not looking for a 1070 or worse you're probably fine. And why would you build a rig for gaming with anything less than a 1080 TI? Preferably 2. My gaming rig has 2 GTX 1080 TIs but right now most of my mining rigs are running 6-12 GTX 1070 TIs each.)

The lightning transactions are on the block chain from when the channel is opened, they are just time-bound with an nlocktime tx parameter. Any time before that nlocktime expires, modifications can be made to the tx. But thinking about it in terms of single channels is kind of misleading. You will be able to send BTC cheaply and transparently. Your client will just choose the best route and tell you the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:17:24
The cost of your tx is based on the size in bytes, not BTC. So in other words, if your wallet has gotten lots of smallish transactions deposited over time, it will be very expensive to send one big one. Your spend transaction has to include all the inputs that have sent you that money.

It also costs $20 to move $50,000. Plan accordingly. Also it's still 100% free to move BTC from gdax, and segwit tx fees are quite cheap. Less than a dollar, usually.
I have zero sympathy for anyone using a legacy (non-segwit) wallet and paying high tx fees. You have had literally a quarter of a year so far to move your funds into a segwit wallet for pennies. Now fees are high for non-segwit TXes and suddenly people who could not be bothered to do anything at all with their BTC for almost 4 months all of a sudden HAVE to move their BTC *RIGHT THIS SECOND GODDAMIT*! It's a little ridiculous.

If you read my post history you’ll see that I have some mining operations so I do tend to have to move a lot of coin. Can’t beat the tx fees for LTC and ZEC right now (I’m sure there are even cheaper - or free - cryptos, but I don’t deal in anything that isn’t supported by a hardware wallet of some kind).

It's great for miners to be able to hedge against volatility.

I could buy futures contracts to lock in the price I need to meet my profitability projections.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:48:15
No, miners are eventually supposed to be profitable entirely from fees. That is the design. In the beginning, it was all block reward and 0 fees, and in the end it will transition to 0 block reward and all fees. That is how the system was designed. It’s right in the whitepaper.

As a user, the fees suck. As a miner who controls almost 300 TH/s, the fees bother me slightly less. I just don't move my BTC quite as often. But one day of mining is about .05 BTC, and I usually try not to move less than .1 BTC at a time anywhere. I will not pay more than 1% in transaction fees, period. But the impact is softened by knowing that I'm one of the people collecting a lot of those fees.

Honestly no idea. I've never played the game, have no desire to. They're all suicide bots, and I don't know what they're doing. The first few learned how to make gold and then taught subsequent generations. Fairly simple machine learning using convolutional networks in a GAN. When one gets banned, the scheduler destroys its container and starts a new one to replace it which creates a new account from a new IP (I have about 24 million residential IPs), runs through the tutorial, and starts farming. I don't know what that farming entails - it looks from my logs like some of them are mining, some are cooking, some are fishing. There is a periodic linear regression that I run over the action sequence of banned bots to try to humanize their behavior, I am not sure how much it helps but I can say with a fair bit of certainty that my system is more sophisticated than whatever they have in place to detect botting.

A computer is a Rube Goldberg machine that runs billions of times a second. So if you have a 3.4 Ghz processor, then 3.4 billion times every second, a pulse of electricity runs through all of the logic gates in your processor from end to end. What do these logic gates do? Generally they do simple binary logic. So if you have an AND gate it will take 2 inputs that can have either some or no voltage charge and it will produce an output of a charge or not depending on the state of its inputs. This is an oversimplification because modern processors actually use nothing but NAND gates really, but in principle this is all correct.

We would just need a different set of problems that are NP-hard to solve but P-easy to verify. Shor's Algorithm applies a quantum superposition to an entire universe of potential solutions to a problem, which makes things like factoring large primes trivially easy in terms of time complexity. If modern cryptography were to migrate to using seeds derived from something that is not parallelizable, it would become quantum-resistant. But don't worry, true quantum computers are still basically a pipe dream. The quantum annealers produced by D-Wave are still basically a very powerful digital supercomputer reading the output of a quantum semiconductor (or is it superconductor? it's like why do we call static variables variables instead of constants?).
I've been toying around with generating seeds from fibonacci sequences that start at an arbitrary position N, calculated to an arbitrarily long sequence F(N)^n . That still has the problem of having only a polynomial time complexity to solve, but the scaling can also be controlled logarithmically. And it's deterministic so it cannot be solved with Shor's Algorithm.

Unemployment based on u5 is misleading. Trump and others made this criticism before they wanted credit for the low unemployment rate. It doesn't count people who stopped looking for gainful employment and settled for work below their skill level, or just plain stopped looking for work. There is no arguing that the S&amp;P has been making new highs, but when banks are leveraged beyond the point they were in 2008, I don't see it lasting all that long. But that's why we're on the Bitcoin subreddit, right?
And I wish everyone would stop calling liberals leftists. They're firmly right wing. If you rely on threat of violence by the government to impose your will, you're right of center. Leftism is the absence of government coercion. It just so happens that most leftists throughout history also happened to be collectivists and many experiments in collectivism have been enforced through government (to the detriment of leftism). I am sure many anarcho-capitalists don't realize it, but they are leftists. Anarchism is the far left. Individualism vs collectivism is the north - south axis of the political compass, but left - right is Anarchism vs. Fascism (Nationalism, Statism, or Authoritarianism if you prefer a less loaded term).

It's "fkin annoying" when people who've never written a line of code in their lives tell teams of engineers with literally multiple lifetimes' worth of combined experience how to write quality software too.
The other person who replied to me is correct, in that there are applications where the release process is slow and careful for good reason. But most production systems are held together with bailing wire and duct tape because engineering is an exercise in "good enough". Software is easy enough to change that agility is its strongest attribute, and that is utilized by good engineers. That doesn't mean the production code that's running your game or this website hasn't been thoroughly tested. There are hundreds of thousands of lines of unit tests and integration tests that it has to pass before it goes into production. But writing quality software is hard. Edge cases are always going to bite you in the ass, because nobody is omniscient (even programmers).
And code changes to the blockchain don't often require a hard fork. In the world of software that is referred to as a "breaking change", or major release. If you're using semver it would be a release that increments the leading version number (e.g. 1.x to 2.x). Most releases are bugfixes (x.x.1 to x.x.2) or point releases (x.1.x to x.2.x), which do not require breaking backwards compatibility (or in the case of blockchains, a hardfork). Only API changes require a major release (broadly speaking, domain-dependent of course).

Not every stock pays dividends, and dividends are priced into the stock. You will not make money buying stocks for dividends, you will lose it to inflation. There is no such thing as a guaranteed ROI (even with bonds/CDs). Inflation is a debit to savings and a credit to debt (e.g. if you owe more than you have, inflation is your friend. If you have more than you owe, it's your enemy. Our economic system does not reward people who save money unless they lend it out).

The hashrate on the test network pales in comparison to that of the live production network, but the transaction volume is also much smaller. So it's hard to compare them. In real terms, the hashrate of the testnet is about 12 TH/s right now, and the hashrate of the live network is over 6 million TH/s. The point of doing what OP describes is to test out lightning network transactions though. They don't actually confirm on the blockchain until you close your transaction channel. But the point is that you don't have to care how long confirmations take. It's designed to facilitate lots of smaller transactions that settle to the blockchain at a later time. Transactions on a lightning channel are more or less free, and you pay tx fees when opening them (I think, I have not read a lot about the LN - someone correct me if I'm wrong). So in the same way a merchant would pay Visa a 3% fee per credit card transaction, he would pay a small fee to settle his LN transactions onto the blockchain. Perhaps at the end of a business day, or whatever.

People don't get that compared to what we had to learn to do what we do, the ins and outs of running a business is pretty easy. It's no cakewalk, but just like every other system that exists, discrete inputs and outputs can be analyzed to determine how it works. Try teaching someone with a BS in Business Administration how to debug a complicated edge case in an asynchronous application scaled across multiple systems, and then try teaching a systems engineer how to balance accounts and delegate tasks. It's not even comparable. You probably have most of the skills required to run a business just from living your life and managing your finances.

The PoW is the biggest contributor to bitcoin centralization. Only an ASIC-resistant PoW is truly decentralized. But I know there is a lot of money invested in maintaining the status quo with regard to PoW, and that's fine. The tradeoff is that bitcoin will never truly be decentralized if you need massive wealth to even contemplate starting a mining operation. I don't buy the small block argument either. We don't need raspberry pi full nodes. I have a rack in my basement with 72 cores, 244 GB of RAM and over 100 TB of redudant disk space with a gigabit fiber pipe. I could easily run a full node for decades even if the block size was increased tenfold. And I am firmly a small fish, by anyone's standards. That whole rack cost less than my gaming rig. But the centralization of mining is a much bigger problem than that.

To put all my cards on the table, in practice I'm a capitalist. I am actually one of those big bad C-level execs. Pinkerton was not the only example of union busting. Henry Ford employed brutal tactics to prevent his workers from unionizing. Nearly every gilded-age capitalist used force and coercion where necessary to hinder fair competition. It's what humans do. We continue to do it now, in a more civilized age in the West, by buying politicians. You and I probably agree on much, and want the same outcomes. I just disagree that the NAP is some fundamental axiom of human interaction to which everyone will naturally adhere. I like to think I'm a good person. I love my family, and I am nice to people. But I'm ruthless. I've done some things that I've rationalized as necessary, but that I truly regret having to do. I resent Capitalism for making them necessary, while at the same time recognizing that every success I have has been due to Capitalism. I take the good with the bad because I'm a pragmatist, but I would like to believe there is a better way.

I'm open to a conversation. The example I gave with horse racing is actually risk arbitrage. If that is gambling, then everything is gambling.
Anyway maybe I'm arguing past you and I should concede that those things are gambling, but that gambling can be done in a way that is mathematically guaranteed to make you a profit if you know your edge. I don't consider that to be gambling, but some people may.

I'm an Anarchist, so I wouldn't mind. I don't share much with ancaps though. They seem to focus solely on capital, business, and profit. I support non-hierarchical organizations with roots in anarchism, like labor and trade unions. As long as ancaps recognize the right to freely associate and collectively bargain, we have no argument. Anarchism is a very firmly leftist political outlook that has been co-opted by conservatives and libertarians. And mind you, I have no beef with libertarians per se. It would be accurate to call me a libertarian socialist or anarcho-syndicalist.
I agree that many of the taxes we pay are bullshit, and I would prefer to be taxed on usage of resources, or money I spend. Not money I earn or money I save. If it were possible to do without bureaucracy, my ideal would be a "luxury-only" taxation system. Meaning a pound of rice is tax-free, but a gallon of high octane fuel for your megayacht is taxed as fuck. I desire this because the cost of basic commodities is inelastic. A pound of rice costs the same whether you're worth $10 or $10,000,000. Flat taxes are regressive, and punish the poor.

The best (non-sketchy) way to short BTC is to sell BTC futures on CME. Which are cash-settled. So the quantity of BTC on exchanges doesn't really matter. Every other exchange that allows you to short, I would not trust with my money.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:55:43
You're not wrong. People like to put things into buckets like "risky", "not risky", but in reality every decision we make in life carries risks regardless of what we decide. In finance it's all quantified, yet people still don't realize the risk of their decisions. For example, most people don't realize that cash is a position. When you're long cash, you're short everything else. Most people only think about investments in terms of their cash value, and cash is "safe". But it's not. Figure out what kind of risk you can stomach, structure your decisions based on that, and hedge as much as it makes you comfortable. BTC futures exist now and are very liquid on CME. If you're worried about the value of your BTC, sell a futures contract.
I think that peoples' perceptions of "gambling" are skewed in a lot of cases. If you have figured out your edge and can prove it mathematically, if you're hedging your bets, it's not really gambling. I only consider taking a risk to be "gambling" when you don't know the odds/PoP and have no hedges. Gambling is something you do from a place of ignorance or nonchalance. Put a tenner on the ponies or whatever. That's gambling. Working out a formula to detect mispricing in the odds on a horse race, and then betting on that while hedging on the favorites is not really gambling.

You can buy D3s for half of retail price right now, sometimes less.

The fluctuations in BTC are too big for a simple mean reversion algorithm to work, I have been trying to adjust the parameters until it works (based on a reversal at low/high MFI combined with a price above/below the VWAP for the same period). The problem is that I can only beat straightup holding BTC over a given term if I overfit my parameters for that exact term. I take the same parameters and adjust the timeframe, and I'm back to negative alpha against BTC.

And you can decide for yourself what benefits you want, and where you want to spend your money.

I agree. The need for LTC is obviated by second layer solutions. Ethereum? Don't get me started. Bitcoin has had "smart contracts" since its inception. It's a marketing gimmick.

Uh, the US doesn't have absolute freedom of speech either. Don't be obtuse. If the average Canadian's right to express his or her opinion is in practice indistinguishable from the average American's, the difference is academic. It's not Orwellian doublethink at all. I suspect you completely missed the point of 1984 if you think Canada's government is in any way "Orwellian". Orwell was a big fan of the British government, and they have the same limits on speech as Canada. 1984 was a criticism of the Soviet Union.
Look up the Tolerance Paradox. A society that tolerates intolerance will inevitably become completely intolerant, as those who are intolerant are not bound by the mores of tolerance. Then you get Nazi Germany. Or If your standard of freedom of speech is *absolute* freedom of speech, then there is literally no country on earth that exists or has existed that has it.

No issue except that there is no mechanism to "pass down peacefully" the rights to something. What do those people own, exactly? A piece of paper? Who certifies it? Who prevents someone else from just walking up and taking the business? In an Anarchist model, that business would have to pay people to protect it. That's good. Having a central government that protects it and taxes everyone else to pay for it is not good.

If you're living hand to mouth, sure. I've been saving and investing since I was 15 years old, I don't really *need* every paycheck. And after a few months, once I start to need some percentage of my paycheck to pay living expenses, I would not mind converting it to fiat. Even if it's at a small loss. The eventual goal is for cryptocurrencies to be money. I don't want to have to have any USD at all.
But per the original question, I would probably not opt to have any percentage of my pay given in BTC because I prefer to use some of the tax advantaged options available to me like a 401k.

Ok, but there's not much you can do beyond publishing the source code and allowing users to compile it. You can have a "trustworthy" developer vet the code for you, which I'm happy to do for people and frequently do. But you're still trusting someone else.

Agree completely. When there is a liquidity crisis in the private sector, the public sector (government) can step in like it did in 2008 and provide liquidity. But when the economy is booming it needs to collect back some of that liquidity so it's there to offer next time. Otherwise we're just building a house of cards.

Without any government, your claim to anything is beholden to your ability to physically stop me from taking it myself. That includes the libertarian idea of private police. But that's still the threat of violence.

I disagree. Presumably the x.509 cert is pinned. If you were to cache it or install a root CA on the client machine, it would open up the whole encrypted channel to tampering for anyone who has infected the client machine. It removes a lot of the reason to use a hardware wallet. I'm a hacker and just thinking about it makes me giddy. I don't need access to your private keys if I can MITM your wallet interface (because I installed a bogus root CA or altered the cert included with your installer). Calling home is, in this case, the right solution. IMO.

No use cases that have actually proven beneficial yet. Most alts are premined shitcoins with some kind of novel use case like gambling. Some of them are useful for fast txes because they're not heavily used yet (e.g. zcash) or they give up security for scaling (e.g. iota).

Ok, my phone draws about .15 watts when I'm using it. It takes about 5 seconds to buy BTC. So it cost me a tiny fraction of a penny to buy BTC. An S9 consumes between 1200-1600 watts, which costs about $3 a day if you're paying ten cents per kWh (I'm paying 7 cents but I am on the low side of the national average), in addition to the cost of the device, which is around $3000-$4000 if you can find one (you will have to buy one on ebay because the preorder sells out within seconds of when each batch is released, but if you somehow manage to preorder you can get one for as little as ~$2500). It would be disingenuous to count the cost of my phone as a device, since I use it for lots of other things besides buying bitcoin. An ASIC miner can literally only mine bitcoin or act as a very inefficient space heater.
You're just being obtuse. Mining is something you do if you want to because it is fun and you're helping secure the network, OR you have an enormous amount of startup capital and want to mine as a business. It is not something you do for profit as an individual.

You can, for the same reason that you can infinitely divide the distance between you and an object and never actually touch it. Devaluing a currency by 100% doesn't mean it's worthless, it means it's worth 100% less than it was in terms of goods and services (the things you use currency to purchase). Take the value of USD today vs its value in 1913. $1 in 1913 = $2,362.08 in 2018. The dollar has devalued 236,208% since 1913.
Edited for formatting and minor addendums.
Also, your math is off. $1 in 2018 would be worth $30 by the end of 2020 given a 3,000% devaluation. 100% devaluation would mean $1 == $2. 1,000% devaluation would mean $1 == $10. 3,000% devaluation would mean $1 == $30.

Don't gamble your rent money on BTC; but if you were thinking about buying anyway and you know the risks and *you have a wallet whose private keys you control* (most important facet, don't leave it on an exchange), then now is a good time to get in.

BTC is worth $0.01 per Satoshi to me ($1 million USD per BTC). I'll buy until it reaches that point, and only then will I sell. And at that point, hopefully there is no need to sell because it's accepted everywhere fiat currency is.

The fact that bitcoin is still using SHA256 worries me. SHA256 was a design flaw. Satoshi's original intent was for your average user to be able to mine. We've got plenty of memory-intensive cryptographic algorithms now. The counterargument to switching PoW is that lots of people invested money in R&amp;D of ASICs, but my response to that is that if they are smart enough to do that, they should be smart enough to know it's not a sustainable model for decentralized PoW if you exclude everyone who's not already wealthy. It leads to the same problems that exist with centralized banking.

If you bought your own *good* machine (Breville, Rancilio) and decent beans (locally roasted, single origin), it would take at least a year of making your own coffee before you'd saved any money (provided you were just replacing one cup from the local coffee shop every morning).
I personally make my own with good beans. A conical ceramic burr grinder, ceramic Hario v2 pourover cone, and temperature regulated gooseneck kettle only cost me about $200 all told. A good bag of beans can be had for $10/lb and can last me a week or so if I'm the only one drinking it. If I wanted an automated grinder I would have paid at least $200 just for that (those blade grinders and flat disc burr grinders are shit). But I like to use a hand crank grinder anyway. You can get a good one of those for ~$50 new.
But really, you can't even compare your diner drip bog standard coffee to a cup from a decent coffee shop. They shouldn't even both be called coffee. One will do in a pinch, the other is like drinking an orgasm.

Well then replace it with "critical thinking skills", which of course are not a de facto component of a classical education (though one could argue that they used to be). Nobody's immune to emotional thinking, but with enough natural skepticism and critical thinking skill, you can catch yourself thinking emotionally and evaluate your thought processes objectively. I don't think it's smug or arrogant to say that the majority of people do not think critically in most decisions. Not to say that they lack the ability, but in my experience, most people lack the will.

Cool thing about science: it's self correcting. People with an agenda funded research and skewed the results so they would look favorable. It happens. Usually it's corrected down the road because everyone in the sciences is looking to get published, and publishing results that debunk previously-accepted hypotheses is the easiest way.
Your argument is old and tired. We shouldn't accept this or that theory, because this old one was accepted for a long time and then proven false! Oh my! Everyone, clutch your pearls! That's literally how science works. Outside of pure mathematics, you cannot prove anything 100%, you can only make educated guesses and then test your educated guesses. If it turns out that your guesses can withstand scrutiny, they get turned into a formalized theory that's used to explain and predict the phenomenon associated with the theory until it can be revised or replaced with a better one.
The "educated" people in your asinine straw man of an example are not at all "educated", because they lack basic science education if they are accepting whatever nutritionists say as gospel without examining their experimental methodology. Control sizes, confounding factors, coefficient of correlation - you need to take all of it into account.

They tried to ban or restrict cryptography in the '90s. Worked super well.
Also, what happens when things get banned or over-regulated? Black markets are created. Are things cheaper, or more expensive on black markets? Risk premium is a real thing that exists. Ban something and you just increase demand while decreasing all aboveboard supply (the thing you can get taxes from).

No. 
In fact, it's so NOT a weasel word that it's actually used in laws. E.g. when attempting to convict someone of a crime, the standard of evidence the state has to meet is "beyond a reasonable doubt". Legal experts have of course written tomes about what that means.

In order to get something usable from a quantum computer, you have to run it through a digital computer. Output you can't observe doesn't really do anything for you. You still have the problem of observing the waveform collapse. The output of Shor's Algorithm is still NP-hard to parse.

You can guarantee consistency when you need to with a noSQL solution. For instance MongoDB is consistent by default. It can optionally be configured to retrieve eventually consistent data from secondary data stores. So you could store the actual transaction data on the primary member of your replica set and get things like data to render your customers' UI from the other members. Enforce consistency where you need it and not where you don't.
Will that introduce a single point of failure? Maybe. You could always run the primary member as a containerized application on something like Kubernetes.

I get "randomly selected" every so often. In my estimation it's a combination of factors. For one thing, I work in tech so my carryon baggage just looks fishy. I take out both (sometimes 3) laptops, but in my bags are at least one WRT router, raspberry pi, usually an airport express and several ethernet cables, every conceivable dongle I might potentially need, HDMI cables, spare power bricks etc. I never know what I will find on site or exactly what I need to do when I get there. 
Secondly I am a firearm enthusiast so I have come up with false positives more than once when they swab me (I assume from GSR on my bag, which never goes to the range with me but who can say), leading to the taint massaging.
Thirdly I'm a professional hacker and I look it. 
And mind you, when I say "every so often" I mean it's happened about 3 times this year. I'd estimate I have flown about 50-60 times this year so far, so it's not like it's a regular thing. I just have beef with the whole idea. The TSA is ineffective and wastes billions of dollars.

Most modern cryptographic algorithms use random primes as their seed values. I actually have a hardware random prime generator to generate my RSA keys. It's a cheap webcam with some americium from a smoke detector taped over the sensor. I wrote some C code that constantly monitors the output and checks its primality to generate random primes. That code runs on a raspberry pi and serves an HTTP endpoint, just serving random prime numbers for all my cryptographic needs. 
Generating random numbers is actually really hard for a computer to do, since digital computers are deterministic. Isotopic decay of radioactive molecules can be simulated given a long enough timeframe (e.g. Some fraction of the molecule's half life), but not accurately to the degree of milliseconds.

For real though, do your thing and keep it to yourself with the level of risk you're comfortable with. Nobody's going to post publicly about tax evasion unless they're an idiot. I guarantee you more than half the people warning you to pay tax on your BTC are doing some funny business themselves.

Who knows? I'm in one of the best positions to know and I don't foresee a change in the laws of physics, but given Moore's Law it seems plausible. We'll have bigger problems though. Nearly all of the world's wealth is secured by the idea that factoring really large prime numbers is NP-hard.

I haven't once mentioned rights. You're the one that brought it up. This isn't a discussion about rights. Though in the same vein that internet access is a basic human right, so should air travel be. But regardless, we don't need to agree on that. My point is the TSA is completely ineffective and wasteful. We would catch more terrorists than the TSA with no security at all, since they have not only failed to catch a single terrorist, they have failed to catch them in audits. Meaning the TSA has caught a negative number of terrorists.

I understand the issue, I work in DevOps. We're slowly transitioning government agencies to CI/CD for their infrastructure, but it's taking much longer than it should because of the red tape.

I think our "common ground", so to speak, is that we're all anti-authoritarian. 
Part of the problem is language. Modern American "libertarians" seem to be a bit confused. The far right, historically, is not Libertarianism. It's Fascism. The far left, historically, is not Communism, it's Anarchism. So in that regard, libertarians (real philosophical libertarians, not "conservatives who want to legally smoke weed") are much more closely aligned with the far left than the far right.
The whole gun thing makes no sense to me personally. Marx was very strongly pro-gun in his Manifesto. He wrote, to paraphrase, that any attempt to disarm the working class must be resisted, with force if necessary.
