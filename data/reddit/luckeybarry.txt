If Bitgo had been hacked do you think the criminals would only have stolen funds from Bitfinex accounts? The flaw is at the Bitfinex end

It shouldn't just come down to competent coders. Why are people so afraid of proper regulation? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:04:57
That's worrying for anyone who has lost money. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 10:18:40
He is biased because he hates the american authorities and their financial system. Bitcoin may become a widely accepted global payment method, being accepted as a national currency is a huge stretch.
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:09:00
Is this trolling? Bitcoin has got a bad rap because the media has tagged it to shady drug sites on the internet, and let's face it that's true to a certain extent. The only way to change that perception is for useful real world applications of Bitcoin to become the norm. There aren't that many of them at the moment, unfortunately.

I have worked in a company where an employee's fb status was used against them in an hr case. Not linked to work in any way, not even browsing

Look at the price history compared to each halving, there is your significant milestone. The price rise always comes months after the halving.
@_date: 2017-01-03 09:56:48
agreed, however we will see an ATH before that happens. This has been brewing for two years
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:19:26
Don't be ludicrous, if people dont pay taxes who takes your rubbish away, provides schools or maintains infrastructure? You know what would be crazy. Being lucky enough to win the bitcoin lottery and then going to jail for tax evasion. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 09:54:38
That's a very good cost basis, I look at the last ATH as my learning phase. Sometimes the hard lessons are the best ones.
@_date: 2017-04-24 18:58:26
Good reply, guess you can't argue a point when there is logic involved.
@_date: 2017-04-24 18:53:05
Charlie Lee had already proposed this so it was hardly a new agreement. Some people just want perpetual drama and you are one of them, however in the end Litecoin is getting exactly what the creator and the vast majority of the community wanted.

The block chain is such a beautiful idea, I find it upsetting when people don't get it
@_date: 2015-04-03 17:14:19
That is the beauty of bitcoin

There's a John Snow joke in there somewhere
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:36:21
Anybody got a link to the Tulip trust document and when it was first made public? If it has been that is.
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:20:55
So they can try to claim the bitcoin without having the keys? It's amazing what money will make people do/say
@_date: 2016-05-04 07:41:13
Yes and that judge will have experts in cryptography presented to him as witnesses. If no proof has been provided then I don't imagine it will be much of a case. I just had a horrible thought, Wright is going to come out and state he can't provide the proof due to legal challenge....
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:59:42
Exactly, he will now spend his I'll gotten gains on trying to get some more naff proof and  come back at a later date when he is 'stronger'.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:48:14
It's simple for him to prove it isn't a con and he is insulting the intelligence of a lot of clever people. That is why he got found out so quickly and is facing the public humiliation he is. He was trying to take the piss on a grand scale and announced it to the world.
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:54:08
Yes, I think I would if an Australian guy was telling me his name was Satoshi Nakamoto. He remembers the content of the meeting very well so why not his appearance?
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:49:54
I would like to think he is still alive and having a laugh at this circus. When he does die the keys are released to charities and his remaining relatives in a timed manner, so all the coins aren't sold at once. 
The downside would be that the media would have a field day and any flaws would be attacked.
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:01:27
Oh what a tangled web we weave, I'm starting to think "satoshi" is delusional. Tick tock
@_date: 2016-05-02 18:54:02
Right over your head, right?
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:29:30
Look at this twitter account- 
I think this may be the work of JVP also, more babbling and "i know something you don't know" types of tweets.
@_date: 2016-05-05 19:32:08
Hal Finney is up there too, lived close to Dorian and was first to test a transaction although it could easily be someone not on that list.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:42:53
I'm more convinced than ever that satoshi will have a more obvious background than both Wright and Kleiman. Someone who was into coding and crypto from a young age.
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:40:47
I think he is funny, in a "The Office" kind of way
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:38:23
Well said Andreas
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:15:31
The bloody accent is a huge give-away to start with, my bullshit detector has just went right off the scale.
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:42:07
It's a gradual process and you would still have exchanges which would not comply. In the end I would think customers would gravitate towards the ones with less risk. I know I already do that.
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:58:58
Kleiman certainly fits the profile more than Wright. What I do know is that if Kleiman was more evidence will come to light that supports this theory.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:27:40
He is trying to get us to pity him, yet at the same time not admitting he's been found out. This guy deserves no pity, he would have happily walked away with all the credit.
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:11:25
Imagine how many people have gotten away with stealing someone else's work in a manner like this. This failure is a testament to the real Satoshi's work.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:32:13
On that panel nick mentions that Bitcoin needs acceptance at the Bitcoin to fiat point, that's what really matters. That showed me how knowledgeable and how much the guy cares about it's success.
@_date: 2016-05-20 07:27:39
No, that time has passed. Sell the news
@_date: 2017-07-05 12:13:35
No, he didn't want to connect from his home network as he knew the dangers. I remember reading that the FBI had matched the times when someone connected to their forum activity on onion sites so even if they can't see exactly what someone is doing they can use other methods. By the way I think we shouldn't need to use any browser for privacy, our internet history should only be accessible through a court order. As it stands I'm pretty sure that too many people have access to it, be it telecoms or government employees...
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:52:38
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:03:01
Revealing himself as Satoshi would generate it's own rewards
@_date: 2016-05-05 08:09:12
He wasn't forced to go on that panel, I think he does come across as arrogant. He talks in broad sweeping terms without any real depth. If he was satoshi why hide it for years then give interviews or talk at conferences hint at at it with a smirk, yet providing no proof. He can't prove he bought the super computer either, in fact the company who he has said to have bought it from have no record of selling it to Craig Wright or any of his businesses. The guys just babbles on in his own fantasy land.
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:06:29
Well said, too many people look on regulation as a bad thing. I would rather pay taxes and receive a degree of protection in return, there are far too many people looking to scam others out of money.
@_date: 2016-05-06 07:23:48
At this point the trust is as real as the proof he provided. It's all hearsay.
@_date: 2016-05-06 17:35:47
I think they have all invested in this charade financially, so they need to believe it
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:06:01
He'll be back again. There is no apology for the claim made, only for his weakness.
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:47:37
Nope, your ISP can tell you are connecting to it. It can't tell what the traffic is or what you are looking at, however it can tell you are connecting to the network through Tor. Why do you think he was using the library rather than his home network if it's totally anonymous? 
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:23:36
Not clearly, maybe he is easily influenced. After seeing Gavin's backtracking I think it was an error of judgement.
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:03:30
Do you think using tor doesn't bring attention to you?
@_date: 2016-05-25 07:07:51
Don't mention any of the bad stuff, mooooon
@_date: 2016-05-27 12:23:11
And thinking that you can outsmart inside information, bots and manipulation of a market not fully regulated is delusional. I've traded and made profit a few times, however it's easy to lose with one bad move.
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:00:21
They can regulate the exchanges though
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:39:04
Delusional, I actually think he started believing he is satoshi. Live a lie long enough...
@_date: 2016-05-05 07:41:13
I don't think he does, he repeats the mantra that everyone is thinking too small repeatedly and then describes applications of Bitcoin that are not exactly ground breaking. He does not come across as one who does not like the limelight, in fact he brags about his achievements and what he allegedly owns.
@_date: 2016-05-06 07:17:38
This document seems to be created solely for the purposes of duping the Australian tax office, there is even a comment about the tax officer. More smoke and mirrors
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:22:35
Very true, its more to do with greed and fear than education.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:54:13
I have tried to get verified  on kraken and it won't accept my uk phone number. Now raised 3 case's with support over three weeks, all unanswered. I have also sent a message to you on here, again unanswered. Does not give me any confidence of using Kraken at all
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:05:25
Hey you could also try gyft website for vouchers. They accept bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:01:18
Many have reported issues getting usd into BTC-E also, so you have a bottleneck at either end, hardly low risk
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:44:56
My apologies, I've checked the format and I was including an additional 0 at the start, international does not include this. Thanks for your help
