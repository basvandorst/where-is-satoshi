Yes, I was wondering too... Yesterday it seemed to be going up, it reached 630 briefly on bitstamp. Now it is almost 500... Probably going down to 450 or so if MtGox announces the trades being disabled.

Out of curiosity, how do you mitigate the price fluctuations?

PayPal doesn't work on public holidays? Cash doesn't?
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:39:02
Yes, but in our Google example, you usually pay upfront to get stuff (ads mostly).

Not everyone is tech savy enough to avoid all the malware. And not everyone can know which sites will lose their bitcoins.
Besides, except for chargebacks, people don't lose money with PP, they just have it locked for less than a year.

Where did you get that from?
Any company that does that is going to lose, because their competition will sell their products first. And in the world of BTC mining, every day counts, as the difficulty doubles every month and a half or so.

Google could pre mine half the coins or so, then sell them for fiat. They can make some of their services payable only in their coin. Then they would avoid banking fees and other issues, plus that coin could be adopted by others because it's backed by google.

Well, gift cards are optional, you can pay for stuff with credit cards, cash, etc. But if a big company would ONLY accept that virtual currency, things would change.

Umm, because they need money for research and development. It's not like those companies can build the ASICs for free.

But most of the BTC businesses do not involve cashing checks, they involve direct deposits and wire transfers, no? So, from their point of view, sending money to buy BTCs is not different than paying your power bill.

Ok, I am not familiar how the process works in Australia, but in the US, I never, ever visited my bank (well, credit union). I don't even know how their office looks like. I do all my transactions electronically. What do you have to do in Australia to buy a bitcoin, with the money from your bank?

18% since yesterday. About 50% since the beginning of the year.

I don't get it. Why would the bank care what you do with your money? Is it their job to force their customers to use the money wisely, or something? What's next, banks closing the accounts of people who gamble, or those who use drugs?

Maybe they were stolen BTCs? I don't see how any sane person would want to get rid of them so fast at such a bad price.

The free market doesn't function in a void. You are confusing free market with anarchy. Free markets operate within or between countries, and those countries still have laws against murder, theft, and so on.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:55:04
Not at all.
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:43:29
I hope you are aware that MtGox BTCs are not representative of the cost of 'real' BTCs.

He is trolling:

What do you mean? No company is forced to accept your money.
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:15:31
Works fine for me.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:36:25
I hope so, but we grew last year based mostly on positive news. Right now, if a lot of negative news hit the press, the public opinion will take quite a bit to recover. And big companies that adopted bitcoin might reconsider their strategy, if they are going to lose 2/3 of their value.
@_date: 2014-07-08 14:13:00
Well, then you should also not use bitcoins, because there are a lot of scary stories about people losing tons of bitcoins (malware, MgGox, deffective hardware, etc.). Not to mention the price going up and down all the time.

Free market doesn't mean everything is allowed. False advertising, fraud, harassment, etc. is not part of the market.
