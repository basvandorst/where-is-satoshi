Why would WalMart or even Google do that? They can play with digital dollars, like in this walmart app example or with google pay. They don't need to create a new currency and back it with stock and deal with all the regulations shit that would entail. Cryptocurrencies work when you need something trustless or decentralized. Black markets love it. If you need to move money between borders in a country with currency controls or some shit, it'd be great. Google has no use for it.
People talk about killer apps for bitcoin. The problem with that is that anything you can do with bitcoin that the general public cares about can be done with dollars. The fact that bitcoin is a different currency offers nothing when paying with a qr code. This app is proof. Some banks/credit cards already have ways to generate single use card numbers for buying things at sketchy places. So many cool things bitcoin can do can also be done with dollars, if people care enough. 
Let's  say people actually wanted microtransactions. I don't think they do, but say people decide paying a few cents per reddit link you click on or whatever is something they want to do. Say Google is running the microtransaction thing. It makes sense as replacing ads with micros. They've got to have exchanges for you to trade dollars for google coins to fill up your wallet. That's overhead, so they're going to charge you a little on the exchange. At first, google coins aren't accepted anywhere. But you could use them through google pay and hey thats accepted at a lot of places, so maybe the annoyance of converting currencies is worth it because besides micropayments you can buy coffee with it. But who cares because you can already use dollars with google pay, or use a debit card or credit card or cash. A new currency does nothing to make it easier for you to pay for stuff. In reality, if google wanted to replace serving ads with collecting micropayments, youd just buy google points like xbox does and pay with those.

Walk me through why they would ever need to do that for their business. They dont need anything decentralized or trustless to issue Wal-Coin. And they certainly don't need the regulation overhead of trading their own currency. They just print slips that say "good for $10". They're called coupons.

How did beanie babies have value? Same thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:22:13
You're talking about transferring value, whether they can instantly spend where they want is something else entirely. Also the transaction isn't anywhere near instant.

Most of the fiat transferred in a day is not actual paper money. Bitcoin is just a decentralized ledger, that's it. Your arguments should be based on why that is useful. Money is already mostly digital. Decentralized is the only thing that gives it value, and honestly I don't think the efficiency trade-off is worth it to most people to give it the value it currently has.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:51:36
New technology brings value to people's everyday lives. Bitcoin has yet to really bring anything of value people need but don't have right now. Like investing in Tesla a few years ago was betting that EVs were going to take off. What are you betting on with bitcoin? That people are going to use digital money to buy stuff? They can already do that. What's the use case that you are investing in here that people can't already do?

When Netflix first started, they were exactly like blockbuster, you just went to their website and got dvds in the mail instead of going to a brick and store. Like the most typical early use case of the Internet, replace physical location with website. Not really a byproduct.

I wouldn't exactly call it charity. The person on the other end isn't getting full value for their gift card. Full value would be charity. This is just a business. You're getting a discount and Purse is taking their cut, because both of you are taking advantage of people in third world countries who are stuck with gift cards and need cash.
That and people laundering credit card fraud.

I don't make charts, but I have both tea leaves and chicken bones if you'd like me to do a reading.

You don't need a whole new currency to prevent credit card fraud. Credit cards are already dealing in digital money. It would not be impossible to make something as secure as bitcoin, filled up like a prepaid credit card, but still actual dollars.

Ryan didn't push tax cuts and increased military spending?
A good chunk of the debt under Obama came from recession things like TARP and the auto bailout (which was passed under Bush) but also because income tax revenue dropped dramatically due to people losing jobs. The big spend under Obama was Obamacare, and that was funded with an increased tax on the wealthy. But the deficit decreased every year for much of his presidency. It's now going back up dramatically now that Republicans are back in charge.

That's true, but in my experience, what you're talking about is iterating on a winning test. Like we added a btc option, and payments went up 3%. Can we squeeze more out of that by making the button bigger? Oh that made total payments drop by 2.5%. Ok what if we just change the placement? Up to 3.5%. Ok let's try changing the color to pop more.
Nowhere I've worked at would keep pushing more experiments when the initial test fails. Maybe you run a second test later that's a very different ui, because you believe in the feature and think you just didnt get it right the first time. And you usually go back to the drawing board, rather than iterating on the first test.But I've rarely seen that. And I've never seen a feature make it to a third a/b test without showing some improvement. When you get to that point, you've got to ask yourself if you want this more (for ideological reasons or youre just too invested in it) than the actual users do. Usually the answer is yes.

It has more than just the blocksize change.
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:22:57
I guess the point is that today, bitcoin replaces the part of banks that people are happy with, and doesn't replace the part people don't like. Unless you think dissatisfaction with banks in 2008 was because of credit card settlement time length or chargebacks.

How is that different from before he had the bitcoin option? From the moment he put up his own content for sale on his own website, you would have been sending money straight to him, whether you use paypal or bitcoin. 
And if Universal suddenly started accepting bitcoin, that wouldn't change shit for the artists. Bitcoin doesn't have anything to do with why you say you are no longer pirating.

My guess is the two main groups of people who are willing to lose 25% selling an amazon card on purse are people who stole the cards (bought with stolen money/credit cards) and poor people in foreign countries who are paid for work in amazon cards. So most likely you're either supporting fraud or exploiting poor people.
@_date: 2016-02-24 06:35:16
You steal credit cards. You buy amazon gift cards with it and immediately use it with purse. You lose 25% converting it into bitcoins, but then you can trade that on localbitcoins and make back some of that loss from drug dealers looking for coins they cant purchase on a credit card. And then you have cash. It's not so much ending up with clean money, as it is not traced to stolen credit card money. That and Amazon does cancel some orders when they figure out it's a stolen card, but by that time the carder has their coins already.

Are you using payday loans as an alternative to banks lol

You store your money in a bank and they steal it from you?

Do you really think that banks don't have / aren't developing cloud technology? This is not unique to bitcoin man. 
It's a pseudoanonymous trustless decentralized ledger. That's it really. It is very inefficient because of this. It makes up for that by being trustless. Most people trust their banks. For them this trade-off is not worth it.
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:11:35
Good lord nothing about that would be unique to bitcoin it could just as easily be visa. Bitcoin is decentralized sure, but that's not a requirement for a Mars colony. I mean shit, it'd already have to use something off chain, which could easily be settled in a centralized ledger, like one controlled by a government. Being on Mars doesn't require people to use bitcoin and doesn't change people philosophically to back a stateless currency.

It's literally a how to sell bitcoin to your  parents, and the selling points are things your parents don't give a shit about. Oh no what if Brad Pitt blows up all the banks! Then he tells them they're all getting yachts. Ok.
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:06:41
For most people this is not an issue. It's a selling point based on fear not solving an actual problem people have. So you'll scare some people into it but most people will ignore you.
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:48:32
What a shit article; you spent a lot of time researching bitcoin, but apparently very little about the current system. Banks don't really exist to store your money, they exist to lend you money. Who's loaning you money with no banks? How does Bitcoin replace it? You lost me when you said bitcoins replace banks because you don't need to store your money in them.
Then you spend so much time talking about how your bank can't lie about your balance. Is that an actual problem that needs solving? Untrustworthy banks fucking people over? Come on. So many bitcoins have been lost to hacking in so many different ways. Oh sure the crypto part is secure, yet people lose them all the time. It's actually harder to lose bank money like that, and it's ensured. 
You don't explain what bitcoin is as much as try to sell people on it, and your selling points are shit.

So then why does the Internet NEED bitcoin if it has paypal?

Yep, I know I transact a few bits every time I push to Github to prove it's me.

The supply is only 25 per 10 minutes if literally nobody who owns bitcoin sells any. If I sell 1 coin, for those 10 minutes the supply was 26. If lots of people are selling existing coins still, the influence of less newly mined coins is minimal.
I once heard some shit about people buying coins direct from miners for shady reasons because they have no trail. I have no idea if that's remotely true, but that would be the only real supply that's heavily affected by the halving. The halving has more effect on miner profits than anything. The idea that it has to move the price up is more likely shilling from miners who don't want to lose half their revenue, and hopeful holders who want to be rich.

I can imagine multiple ones, with many that have legit sounding names, but are basically rubber stamp certs. If you can pay, you get the food safety cert. Then as a consumer, I don't know if I'm being tricked or if it's a legit cert. Then we'd need regulations for the cert companies.

Big event happens in Turkey, price affected. Big event in Britain, price change. Don't be so naive that the same can't happen to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 19:39:09
There's a lot more bitcoins sold each day than is mined. If you want to buy bitcoins, and no miner sells, you still have thousands and thousands of others willing to sell. Most of the supply of bitcoins is already in circulation.

Just buy some damn btc and sit on it then.
