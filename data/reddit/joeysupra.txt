nobody is probably here that was in the scene then, nobody saw a future in bitcoin and probably sold off.
I am sure there are a select few...
@_date: 2014-12-14 18:17:32
probably someone with a very large mining operation?

@_date: 2015-01-13 12:11:52
can you post the TXID of the actual transaction? that bitcoin address shows no pending transactions
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:56:27
i have ubuntu installed. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:36:05
I have a Trezor, but this all sounds foreign to me, can someone make a youtube video with step by step instructions? I will tip good for sure!
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:45:32
the only option for me is Gemini, they are the best!  bank transfers and wire transfers are free.
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:32:09
Dont keep your coins on coinbase, simple as that. buy coins and take them off right away
@_date: 2017-03-09 09:30:17
the question is how LOW will bitcoin go if it doesnt pass? i guess down to 300 or so
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:00:12

@_date: 2016-12-24 02:07:23

can you explain how i do this? the original transaction was on my mycelium wallet, and i wrote down the seed and imported into my Multibit HD wallet on PC
@_date: 2015-08-24 02:58:21
question is, how do i do that?
@_date: 2015-08-24 02:58:43
wow you didnt have to do that, thank you so much!
@_date: 2015-08-24 02:34:40
so in multibit HD, it will allow me to send an unconfirmed transaction back to myself?
@_date: 2015-08-24 02:33:47
can you explain what this means to a somewhat newb?
@_date: 2015-08-24 02:23:22
its showing in my wallet at unconfirmed, but my original question being sent with no fee, and there was another output for change.
@_date: 2015-08-24 02:13:18
can you explain how i raise the fee?
@_date: 2015-08-24 02:13:54
the transaction wasnt for $10, it was for 1 full bitcoin
@_date: 2015-08-08 22:35:05
brain wallet is shut down?
@_date: 2015-08-24 02:59:50

@_date: 2015-08-24 12:21:56

@_date: 2015-08-24 02:18:09
currently im using Multibit HD on PC, originally it was on my mycelium, i can do this if im the person receiving the bitcoin? i thought only the sender can raise the miner fee?
