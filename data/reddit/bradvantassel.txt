It is a standard or protocol just like TCP/IP, or the Internet .It's not owned by anyone. It operates by simple mathematical rules that everyone who participates in the network agrees on through this simple mechanism. It is programmable money, you can look beyond the price, you can look beyond the volatility.

Nowadays, people who have knowledge about cryptocurrencies are gaining numbers. compared way back before cryptocurrency started. We can't say that we are 100% ready for it, but most of us are. Here in my country, many people think of cryptocurrency as a form of scam. But the truth is, they just lack the proper knowledge about it.

people who really concern to cryptocurrency and have knowledge about it that is very small. But I believe in the near future, when application of Blockchain is used in the real life, Crypto will like as Internet, will be indispensable

You can send bitcoin from anywhere in the world and convert it to cash almost anywhere.

On the other hand, in this period there is little jump in the price of bitcoin ( more than  $ 7000 ), and however, most of cryptocurrencies has jumped  by an acceptable rate, so all of this change in the market is  due to the development of Bitcoin. Plus, that's why the government  are always attacking Bitcoin in different ways because they know that if Bitcoin destroy , then all of cyrptocurrencies will  disappear.

Crypto has tremendous potential in the future. generally, the results are certainly crypto increasingly can give great results. However, there are still many obstacles for people wanting to access the crypto as still the lack of facilities at their disposal and understanding which is still the basic about crypto

There are also easily so many ways how people can make use and benefit from it. One such use case is simply sending money between countries. Previously, you had to send money through banks or payment services, now you can do it on your own with crypto.

It's not only about Bitcoin but also about many different assets. People tend to buy Bitcoin even though they don't understand cryptocurrenncies or they don't even bother to read about them. People panic right now because its price is constantly decreasing without any particular reason. Don't focus on the price, focus on the technology.Check it out here: [

crypto currency is gradually spreading and is breaking the typical orthodox mindsets which had no belief in it.
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:49:26
we try to analyse both Bitcoin and altcoin ,Bitcoin is strong in the market and it have full control in the market. When Bitcoin price falls down altcoin value also depriciates so according to my point of view Bitcoin will remain at the top and be the king of the crypto world . In future we can  predict  that there will be more altcoins  and it may dominate after the blockchain technology is matured.
@_date: 2018-08-25 05:58:34
now the cryptocurrency market is being dominated by altcoin, because it can be seen in [coinmarketcap.com]( and 
[Cryptochartindex.com](  that bitcoin dominance is only at 36%, whereas by the end of 2017 bitcoin dominance is at 65%, that means for now altcoin is on the rise
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:06:13
The problem right now is its not yet widely accepted in the whole world. Also volatility is really crazy.
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:22:29
i definitely agree with you. Cryptocurrency now has a space for a bright future, actually it has given many people a chance to be stable financially.

I think it's good for me to expect great results from bitcoin, and I hope bitcoin prices will rise more than now, bitcoin prices go up until the world recognizes bitcoin's existence and uses it as a major investment
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:39:24
In my own perspective bitcoin will take the market eventhough it is still suffering from price decrease. But still it will take control the market because I know it can recover as soon as possible and it can even increase its price as its seem.
@_date: 2018-08-20 10:05:03
True, bitcoin is an investment that can provide good benefits, but I don't like to put all my savings in bitcoin

Bitcoin is a digital currency. It is also true that bitcoin works as a real money. The biggest truth is that bitcoin can make anyone rich. Bitcoin is constantly making progress

In general, there is a big difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in many things like,  value of  the price, Market cap, Volume. and even their popularity ( users ). Furhtermore, all the market is related to the evolution Bitcoin, so the altcoins are the followers, and it is certain that Bitcoin is the controller of the whole market.
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:17:36
I agree that it is gradually spreading and those who are new are wondering how they can benefit.
@_date: 2018-08-16 08:56:05
In some countries Bitcoin has really exploded, like the US. I know Bitcoin has not really been legal worldwide, it's pretty new compared to some countries and some young people. Only those who really want to know and invest in Bitcoin will research it. Efforts are still being made to make Bitcoin popular or replace current currency.
