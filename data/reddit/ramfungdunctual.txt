It's just getting started. I have been pushing updates.

Good stuff man. Thank you, your input is very much appreciated. +1

Thanks! I'm so glad you like it.

Thank you! I'm so excited, I look at it all day. Keeps my nose out of the exchange pages.

blockchain.info is what I'm using for BTC. Do you have a preference of ticker api?

The ETH version will be out next week. You can switch between them easily, just need to wait for Samsung store.

I believe blockchain.info is an average of many exchanges. I didn't want to play favorites with any particular exchange, but I'll look at Gemini. Also thanks for the feedback about the seconds. I had them initially but removed them, they can be easily added. I want the app to be as functional as possible.

Thank you for your feedback everyone! I'm going to be doing a ton of work on this tonight.

It's not the if statement, it's the file read or communication with a home app via Bluetooth and the constant polling for settings changes. It either happens constantly (battery drain), or it happens on load and the watch face could be out of sync. It's all easily doable, but if it costs the fact that I get better battery life on this face than on a simple factory face, it's hard to justify.

This is a great idea. Make it clear they you aren't doing a bunch of .49 transactions with bitcoin, but saving up the number and deducting a bank transfer at the end of the week, and people will be happier. Also, some infographics on your security will go a long way. People are used to getting smashed with fees from coinbase so lots of users will want to see a breakdown of the example fees they would pay.

Thank you, and yes I'll have the 24 hour version on the app store this weekend, it will take Samsung about a week to approve.

Thank you! If you have any suggestions let me know.

Thats exactly what i was talking about. Then you have to make a file read over and over to check it once it's on the watch, or you just leave it in memory and risk it being out of date and forcing a restart of the app.

It's generally how things are done with watch faces on Samsung. The benefit is that it's pretty easy on the battery life. I'm working on a more full featured one but the features keep costing battery life. I don't know what the people want though, for this specific app I was assuming battery life&gt;full of features. I definitely cut some from this build once I realized that my watch lasts longer than it did with a regular, but a more full featured one is on it's way.
