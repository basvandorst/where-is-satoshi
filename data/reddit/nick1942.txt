There are many bad scenarios that I can imagine. I'm sure Pump and Chump Atack´s are the most barren.

In the end, the rebels are tricked and ripped off by their own invention.
The invention with which they wanted to push greedy banks of the trohn.
Ripped off because they are no better than the people they despise. But that's just a thought.
Fortunately, we are all civilized people and we are not in a virtual gold rush. Luckily we are all in control so I do not need to worry....

I see bitcoin as an alternative investment that can be used to avoid banks that were responsible for the collapse of the global economy in the past. The collapse of 2008 was a driving force behind the development of Bitcoin. Now we have the same banks and the same greedy bankers in the system. Search the error.

You already see what Bitcoin brings into our lives.
an outstanding object of speculation.
in my opinion this is not the use for which he was invented, but what still is not yet can be.

Sure, but you know as well as me. Once you're in business, you just can not get out of it. The same problem that prostitutes have. Just the tempting call of money. GIF or not.

Oh fuck ... now I understood it too: D I've looked at the GIF again. You have to know: As a German, these GIFs are not always clear at first time. You can interpet many things in there.
