Thank you for posting this, I didn't want people to think I was making things up 
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:45:02
I've been seeing this a lot, I will certainly give it a try!
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:18:59
I'm very interested in IOTA and Monaco at the moment. I'll definitely take a stab at both

US banks all hit you with fees if you use an ATM owned by another bank. Total ripoff. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:07:18
Maybe you can help me with a question. One of the biggest sales pitches for bitcoin is that you can send money to eachother for free instantly across the world. Why are there so many fees involved? They seem to go against everything bitcoin stands for
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:57:19
My issue is with (I'll just say coinbase) you get fees to put money in, then when you try to cash out, you get hit with fees trying to take money out. Even banks don't hit me with fees trying to get my own money out. I know atms charge a fee to take money out, but if you stay within your own banks ATM there are no fees incurred. I dont know if that option exists with crypto currencies yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:52:41
That's a good point

The middle of the month seems to be when value drops. 15th-17th has been the best days to buy the last few months. Sell now while the value is prime and rebuy on the 15-17th. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:47:09
Good to know, till give this a shot. Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:20:20
I wish I had started buying back then haha
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:53:38
I never said it's what makes it valuable. I said it was a sales pitch that I've seen. I know why bitcoin is valuable. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:21:22
I'm not complaining, I'm simply asking a question trying to educate myself more. I didn't know asking questions and trying to learn was complaining.
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:41:16
People have suggested buying litecoin because of much smaller fees, then selling for bitcoin on your preferred market 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:28:28
How ridiculous is my statement looking 9 days later?
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:46:12
The low is gonna be around $2000 - $2500 hopefully. It will continue to lower steadily then fluctuate between $2000 -$2500 until there is another upgrade/announcement/block. We'll be in this area for the next few 3 1/2 years so I hope you can be patient. 
To all of the people that are down voting this, set a reminder for 1 year and then again in 3 years. Watch for yourself. Laugh at me when I'm wrong, I don't mind. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:21:03
Don't get discouraged when the price goes down. There is a possibility it will continue to do so over the next few months / years. Just keep storing them away for the future 
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:23:56
In theory, hundred dollar bills have their value because they are backed by gold in the federal reserve, not the paper they're printed on. There is ALWAYS a physical thing that create REAL value. The things that do not have a physical use / backing fail almost 100% of the time. This $3600 value is grossly inflated and it won't be the value for long. It's gonna be a while but we'll be around the $2000 mark soon. John Mcafee (if you haven't yet, watch all of his videos about bitcoin, very interesting/ informative) the biggest bitcoin miner in the USA was just on an interview the other day and said the value is literally the energy used to make the coin, which costs around $1,000 right now. You are not wrong, your just early. The price is falling and will continue to fall for a while until its actual value is restored. Then in another few years when the coins are halved again, we'll have another massive price jump. When there are no more bitcoin to be mined is when we get to see what people are willing to pay because they can no longer acquire them by mining themselves. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:29:25
Am I still to confident in my prediction? And it's only been 9 days. Where will we be in 6 months? Probably under $2,000 
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:26:11
And just to be clear, I'm not spreading fear. I'm not telling anyone to sell. I'm holding mine, that's why I said "I hope you can be patient." If you think that the price cutting in half is ridiculous, how do you explain the price quadrupling in less that a week? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:30:22
I don't think GDAX closes... but I look forward to talking to you again soon 
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:19:20
So if bitcoin plummets there will be no reason to mine them. Wouldn't that kill bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:27:39
You getting my coins ready? I know you can "read candlesticks" so you are aware it was down to $3,266 an hour ago and it's only been 9 days since my prediction. Imagine where it'll be in 6 months... 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:39:05
Don't lose confidence, just buy when the prices level out at the bottom. These same gains have happened in the past but it always comes back. The price going down is the best thing that can happen for bitcoin because people who were not willing to get in at $5000 will be willing to at $2000. When it's back in the $2000 range, we can buy lots and when the price shoots to $10,000 next time we can sell high then start over again when the price falls. History always repeats itself.

I commented a few days ago that it would continue to drop between $2000-$2500 over the next year or so and reddit wasn't having any part of it. Saying it would never go below $3,000 again. As if the "value" created between July 17th - Sept. 4th is the new value just because prices skyrocketed again. This exact same thing has happened many times before and it looks exactly the same each time. It will certainly continue to happen as long as bitcoin is around. That being said, It's nice to see a fellow skeptic. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:31:16
Buy away, good sir. Buy away
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:33:20
I'm not gonna give you the address until it falls and stabilizes under 3,000 just to keep things interesting.

You don't have to be upset, I'm just being realistic. And Good, how many piece of bitcoin are you going to give me? I'll set a reminder so I can let you know when the price gets under $3000. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:03:33
Because I'm asking the world for their opinion on a legitimate question? One that no one knows the answer too? The answer is right in front of everyone's faces they're just too excited about big gains, and too scared of losing money because they bought high. I'm not here to convince anyone, I'm only here to share my opinion. Set a reminder for 1 year and then again in 3 years. Watch for yourself. Laugh at me when I'm wrong, I don't mind.
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:45:01
Please explain?
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:58:37
I made this prediction yesterday when it was high and the price has dropped over $500 overnight. So yes, really. Don't buy yet

You'll notice that I said "in theory" before my comment about the $100 bill. The fact that that is the only thing you took from my comment tells me that this conversation will continue to go in circles. I'm fully aware of how value works and is created and I'm not here to have discussions the inner workings of how supply and demand works. I'm not here to convince you of anything. Good luck too you.
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:01:29
That depends, you still haven't said how much your supposed to give me yet. My prediction was so crazy that you volunteered to give me that money. Not that it's gonna go up $200 on a day when the price has already gone up $1,000.Plus, I predicted a $2500 drop off out of nowhere. You gotta say something a little more unlikely to get paid for it 
Edit: That being said, I still don't think it's gonna stabilize over $4000 for a while.
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:56:26
Bitcoins value is the electronic / hardware costs to mine it. It currently costs just over $1000 to mine a coin. So the value is just over $1,000 for now. When the coins have all been mined, the value will the rise due to scarcity. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:39:13
They're just gonna wait until everyone panics and buys back in so they can sell again. This is a terrible time to buy. Just hold and be patient.

Excellent explanation sir, you the real MVP! Thanks!

Could someone explain this to me? I don't understand...
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:20:38
Because it's inflated value that's only been there since July 17th. It's not value. It's only been there for a month and a half. When all of the posturing ends, it will be closer to $2500. You don't think it's strange that on sept 4th, majority of the cryptos took huge losses? It's people with a ton of money posturing. Now that they know that the peak has been reached, people will steadily be backing out. Majority of the people that are involved with this are people try to get rich quick because they say unbelievable growth. Lots of them got in at the top and don't have thousands of dollars of disposable income. Your not looking at this from a realistic point of view. I'll leave this saying, I hope you are right, but the value cutting in half is good for all of us that couldn't afford to buy a ton at $4500. Stop looking at it like a bad thing, and look at it as a time to buy a lot more for the next big jump in 2021 when we reach the next block.
