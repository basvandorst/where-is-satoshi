Thank you. I’m glad you enjoyed the experience. I think they’re probably just as much fun to make as they are to solve.

Hey! Updated sharing, apologies, thought I had already done that.

Yasssssss. This is what I want to hear! If you need some back up man-power for execution, happy to help! We have artists, designers, experience, and boots on the ground. Would love to give you a hand, we understand the challenge of puzzle design, scaling difficulty, and gating prizes. But that was a very promising start for your first pass. Way to go.

Thanks, updated.

Yeah no problem. You’ll see u/pineapplefund is the same handle that set up r/PineappleArcade and later posted about donating bitcoin to us for puzzle development and prizes.

No, we’re definitely not running any malware on the site. But feel free to ping our CTO  on

Someone streamed playing the puzzle on twitch, if you have any trouble getting started. [
@_date: 2018-10-15 02:35:51
Yes, there is a notification for when the solution has been achieved and the prize has been won. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 23:12:22
Yes that is really me. You can find my latest project at neondistrict.io. That's what I'm referring to at the end of the video. Our discord is our most active community, and where we collaborate.

We're working on solving this challenge on our discord, welcome to join us: [   
Thanks for this great puzzle by u/cryptopuzzle_net aka [ your puzzle last year was epic. Looking forward to seeing how this unravels. :)

The Golden Pineapple Puzzle has been solved by  Apparently he/she frequently solves 4D rubik cubes.
The program created by  was written after first figuring out the solution state, so it still required human ingenuity to resolve - and we were under the impression that someone would be able to figure out the logic and solve it by hand faster than it took someone to figure it out and then code it. However, the solver coded this in under 8 hours. We were blown away. Congratulations on the big win.
Here's the program they created to solve the Golden Pineapple:
I'll include a quote here from our discord regarding the solver " is a computer science and logic god, he/she solved a puzzle on Paradox of the Cryptomancer programmatically in like 20 minutes."

There are 11 levels.

Hey solvers! We have a pretty robust puzzle solving community working on this challenge in the Neon District Discord, and we'd love to welcome anyone to it. The community of solvers includes Coin Artist, Zden, Cloverme, ARGSS and pretty much every solver and creator of the past few years. Open discord invitation here:

I hadn't seen that game, but it looks like something I would like to play. I do love adventure games and dungeon-crawlers, but the current game I'm developing is trying to combine my niche loves with more of a mainstream appeal. 
The goal is to get more wallets into users' hands and to provide them with an opportunity to create economic value through gameplay, so we needed to build substantial game mechanics to support that effort. For instance, an open world with those types of systems would be an enormous beast to manage at scale, but maybe someday.

Check out r/PineappleArcade, Pine started that reddit. We stopped maintaining the reddit when we shifted the focus to the game, Neon District. But I can ping Pine and have them say hello here.

I contacted u/fitwear, I'm the owner of 1FLAMEN, a prize address for a cryptographic challenge which recently received stolen funds originating from 15Zwrz: 
Transaction: 
I'll be returning the coins to the owner when I receive a current address. This is definitely a bitcoin first for me! Just crazy.
