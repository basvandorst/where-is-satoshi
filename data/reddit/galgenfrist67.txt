3300 yuan
@_date: 2016-04-16 16:45:47
tl;dr : the price could go up or down.
@_date: 2016-04-18 08:30:10
Care to elaborate or ELI5 ?
Is this a future project or already implemented ?

Yeah since their last server update I'm also having difficulties connecting to Huobi, either loging in from a web browser or using bots. My bots randomly get errors like timeouts, "connection closed by peer" or "no route to host"... really annoying.
@_date: 2015-12-26 19:45:01
Up, down, ... whatever. As a trader, I just love the volatility.
@_date: 2014-10-13 17:20:45
Don't be so psychorigid. It doesn't have to have "bitcoin" in the title to be relevant to bitcoiners.

He just did it at 395.55

This is the most fucked up thing I've read today.

The sooner the better. And then BOOM!

1 year = 12 months.
BTC price is still ~4x higher than last year at the same time.
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:59:13
Bustabit ?
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:19:20
Yeah, just like that $339 unbreakable floor that melted like butter in the sun. See you at $10 lol
@_date: 2015-05-02 21:13:26
It's funny how you guys are only happy when you can get more fiat by getting rid of your bitcoins.

The Front National's economic adviser is a half-brained clown. [Here]( is his opinion on Bitcoin (in french).
Summary :
* Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme deployed by the private banks (wtf ?) to steal your wealth and replace your hard cash.
* Bitcoin fanatics advocate the euro (re wtf ?)
* You can't touch a bitcoin, therefore you can't trust it
* Bitcoin will be banned, but blockchain is a good tech for the government

Now that's oldschool.

Buy low, sell high.

I always want more, price doesn't matter.

Correct me if I'm wrong but last time I checked, Bitcoin hashrate was 34000x larger than the TOP500 supercomputers total computing power : 
*  : 567 PFlop/s
*  : 19325693 PFlop/s

Exactly. Their orderbooks look like shit now, flat and big spreads. You can move the price 20 yuan with a 15 BTC market order on OKCoin.cn.
Chinese exchanges should introduce a maker/taker fee schedule instead of a 0.2% fee for everyone.

I don't understand. Your title says that your model is nonlinear, yet the formula you provide here is linear. Also, exp(-110) is of the order of 1e-48. Your formula is strange.
Finally, the blue curve tends to infinity as time increases which is not realistic at all. Try fitting it with the error function (erf).
@_date: 2016-09-10 10:34:50
Okcoin.cn is working for me, API is also good.
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:59:57
This is just a diversion guys. They are still working on the real stuff behind the scenes. Right ? Right :-( ?
@_date: 2016-10-02 08:57:57
It looks like he market sold everything on Bitfinex 3 hours ago. The price went down to 575 in less than a minute. Typical noob move.

I use Tradingview for charts/indicators.

The UNIX time is in unit of seconds, so yes 1 csv file gives you way more information than you need for daily data. As I said, you just need the last price of each day. Now, each csv file listed in the link corresponds to one exchange. I recommend using bitstampUSD if you want the longest time series up to now, but you can also look at bitfinexUSD and OKcoinCNY.
In the csv file, the third column is the volume. To get the daily volume you just sum all the volumes over one day, obviously.
@_date: 2016-05-08 17:02:33
Close price and volume in .csv here :

Sure, see : 
"He also says he can’t send any bitcoin because they are now owned by a trust."
@_date: 2016-05-30 11:01:22
It's at ts.whalepool.io now, I just found out yesterday.
@_date: 2016-05-10 07:39:49
Which exchange is this data taken from ? It could be a long squeeze but it looks more like a misprint.
Also, maybe you figured it out yourself but the first number (e.g. 1394430764) is the UNIX time. So if you want the daily close price for example, you just need the price values at 00:00 each day.
@_date: 2016-05-22 15:34:05
He is talking about private blockchains I think.

The National Front is not a neo nazi party, and Marine Lepen would be considered a leftist in front of Trump. The National Front is a legit party and would currently get 28% of the votes, which would get Marine Lepen to the second and final round for the presidency. 
Now back to the topic, this party is against EU, banks and basically everything that is unregulated. Lepen thinks a cashless society is bad for the people, and as Bitcoin is a form of digital currency she wants to ban it (she even thinks Bitcoin is backed by Goldman Sachs *et al.* to eradicate cash lol). But she clearly has no clue what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:56:53
eh ? I thought he couldn't do this because his coins are locked in a trust. This guy has serious mental issues.

Markets generally don't behave as a random walk.

Ok forget the first link, I just discovered this : 
It's already formatted the way you want.
@_date: 2016-05-16 08:24:08
From your website : "However, the malicious external party involved in this breach, managed to alter our system so that ETH deposit transfers by-passed the multi-sig cold storage and went directly to the hot wallet during the breach period."
Can you comment on this ? How can a multi-sig be "by-passed" ?
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:47:26
It's just bitterness. They are in their jealousy, you're in your jaccuzzi lol

You are right, the tweet is completely wrong. Currently the tax is 36% and this will be decreased to a 30% "flat tax" in january. The bitcoin.fr article refers to the rejection of other amendments about further tax reduction/exemption.
