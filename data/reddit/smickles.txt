Actually, that's the claim that MP is making, as well as the reason that I even wrote this post because he made that claim at the bottom of a ;tldr. I wrote my post to highlight the claim.

Since the talk page is now easily in tldr; territory, I wrote up a summary of sorts 
@_date: 2012-11-23 18:43:23
"O.BTCUSD.C070T" looks a lot like traditional option names. "GOOG121222C00285000" is for google calls at 285, the mpex option is for the usd/btc exchange rate calls at 7.
You can calculate an implied leverage by the price compared to the current spot price on mtgox. However, leverage really comes into play when you accept margin from MPEx. Whereby you essentially buy (or sell) these things without personally having the BTC to back up the move. This separation of margin/leverage to an optional state is good so that 'newbs' can't screw themselves over playing with things that they just don't understand.
As [jurov]( points out, that high barrier to entry is also a good thing. Even setting aside 3rd party brokers, there are helpful tool which many avail themselves of such as [PyMPEx]( 


one bit of criticism here, All major US exchanges do not do this. They all have high and expensive barriers to entry, don't provide a user-friendly Bitcoinica-style interface, and their users have to deal with more security barriers than the GPG POSTS that MPEx users have. 
Yet most 'mericans have heard of the NYSE.

While looking at the 'all data logarithmic' charts on  I feel like the price levels won't sustain exponential growth, maybe periods of exponential growth. However, the difficulty feels like it will do nothing but grow exponentially.
Maybe these feelings point to the possibility of technology improving exponentially, where other things might not :o

Heh, while I'm wondering what you mean by 'acutal post', I'll just assume that you mean MP's article on trilema. It had already been submitted, but the topic of discussion on that article and in the comments on the reddit submission were not the same as what I attempted to get at with my blog posting.
Yes, I could have commented on the submission to reddit, but reddit is not the only, nor the best, place to comment on things. My blog also reaches some people who do not come to reddit. 
I could have investigated the issue, but it should have been clear that was not my intention by the length of my post and the way I wrote it for the ;tldr sort of crowd. Again, I was trying to bring attention to MP's claim at the end of a lot of text which was sort've just source material for the part I highlighted.
I copied the relevant quote as a footnote (in diminished font at that) it was a reference and I did it that way because there was not an appropriate anchor to link to on MP's page. It seems to me that you are trying to make it look like that quote was the main content of my post. It wasn't.
If, in light of my explanations here, you still think my post is blog spam, please help me out :)

@_date: 2012-12-18 03:02:51


I think most of the typical users are quite secretive. I've heard they are cypherpunks. And some (maybe most) users seem to be rich or people working on behalf of a rich person. But, because not too many people talk about their MPEx activities publicly, it's hard to tell.
Most of the activity seems to be in the options listed there.


That's actually an [option]( not a future. But the reasons to buy it vary.
It could be a speculative long buy. You'd make more btc buying that than btc themselves if the price rose.
It could be part of an [options spread]( In this case I can't say if it's bullish, bearish or neutral because I don't know what the other components are.
Options are interesting because there is so much you can do with them. It's even possible to make btc no matter if the exchange rate goes up, down, or remains the same.
And I'm sure there are people using it to hedge risk. When there are sudden price drops, you typically see a lot of puts being bought. This means people are hedging against the loss in btc value. When there are sudden price gains, you see people buying calls. This gets them more btc even as the btc they have gains value.
It's the most liquid bitcoin options market I know of, a fact which is spoken to by the large variety of motives playing out in it.

I think it's unlikely that a reliable source will try to show that Bitcoin isn't a ponzi because they would be staking their reputation on a position that isn't logically sound.
The pattern should go like:
* A says Bitcoin is a ponzi with source
* B highlights the flaws in the justification the source has with a source of their own.
We don't have that second source, even though the justification which the 'A' sources use is solely that Bitcoin shares on characteristic with *pyramid schemes*. And that on its own is hardly sufficient justification for accusing Bitcoin of being a ponzi scheme.
I see this as a shortcoming in Wikipedia, but I'm not sure of a good solution.
Apparently, using one source, say, the SEC definition, and another source, say, one that describes the properties of Bitcoin, and pointing out that they are incongruent or contradictory is against Wikipedia policy too.

@_date: 2012-11-29 20:46:00
[Here]( is the recent news.
@_date: 2012-11-25 02:12:03
Using the SEC’s definition of a ponzi: “A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.” The rest of the paragraph describing what a ponzi scheme is only lists attributes they might include.
Later, the page lists red flags:
* “High investment returns with little or no risk.” I really doubt that you can find a source saying that there is little to no risk in buying bitcoins.
* “Overly consistent returns.” Looking at the chart, the returns have been anything but consistent.
* “Unregistered investments.” True, Bitcoin isn’t registered, however, it’s not the sort of thing that the SEC requires to register, either in the consideration that it is math, or if you consider it to be a raw commodity, or if you consider it to be a currency.
* “Unlicensed sellers.” True here, but Bitcoin isn’t a security, or a regulated commodity, and all reputable exchanges have registered with FINCen and comply with AML regulations.
* “Secretive and/or complex strategies.” There really isn’t a strategy, but maybe you could extend this to the protocol which is freely available information, and the non-technical workings of it are fairly basic and even described here on wikipedia.
* “Issues with paperwork.” Every Bitcoin transaction in history is well documented. And, as it is not a business, there are no financial reports to falsify.
* “Difficulty receiving payments.” It’s easy to generate a receiving address, and it’s easy to receive payments at that address. Maybe this could be construed to be about exchangeing BTC for fiat currencies, in which case, it’s likely there are a number of online exchanges at you disposal, local exchanges, or individuals making themselves publicly known to buy or sell bitcoins.
I’ll repeat the definition here for clairity, “A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.” Bitcoin does not pay returns. I have found no source indicating that the software is designed to do this.

Being against modeling of human behavior would be a silly position to hold. The fallacy I point out, as I understand it, is an odd one as far as fallacies go. The oddness being that it's only a fallacy when there is evidence that the models either don't have predictive capabilities or they don't make useful predictions. From all of what I've read, chart patterns do not make useful predictions.

Of course if everyone believes it, it works.

I suspect the 'lot of smart people' don't involve themselves in the use of chart patterns due to the evidence that it does not work.
