Bitcoin should be the least of your worries then.

I hear you need to break open ASICs nowadays.

I’ve been reading about how NEO has centralized nodes though, any worries there?
Seems to have a great community and fanbase

I swear crypto investors always seem to find the best memes

That does seem a bit on the highend.

Why do NEO?

So how this works is you take a loan based on your current bitcoin to buy more bitcoin. And then add more loans based on the additional bitcoin.
This works since Bitcoin will always appreciate in value right?

What would have happened if a user made a mistake and was trying to get his/her money back? Customer service hell...
The exchange should be obligated to call every single user to get their money back ��

What about a box to hold my recovery phrase?

How will binance be doing in 148 years? This is just a weird comparison.
Also, once DEX goes mainstream, will binance maintain that sort of profit?

Agree with this sentiment.
But also, why is nexon venturing into this market? The major application of blockchain for them would be tokenization of in-game assets, but u dont need an exchange for that.
