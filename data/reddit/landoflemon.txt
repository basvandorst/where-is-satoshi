Living in Ireland, accounts here can be linked. I assumed that's the same with the rest of Europe?

And mine finished today within approx 100 hours too. I'm pleased that waiting is over. Best of luck

Thanks a lot for the advice, much appreciated.

Ha, I think we all need a break. Thanks and have a good Christmas!

Thanks, these responses are somewhat comforting, and I do have time now in which I can't do anything but a little more research

Thanks for the advice on the Segwit wallet for future transactions. I just don't feel great at the moment!

Thanks for letting me know, I can't be too far behind! Just don't like the complete out of control feeling associated with the long transactions. 2 days prior I had transferred with the same €10 fee and it took approx 3 hours to confirm, so I never questioned my fee. Anyway, it's all part of the learning process!

Thanks, if it doesn't go through and lands back in Mycelium again, I may give another BIP39 compatible wallet a chance. Maybe it's not easy for wallets to suggest fees for certain transaction duration's.

Very similar situation for me 312sat/byte 4 days ago. If I remember to, I'll post here when it transfers or is dropped, just to let you know as a reference. Perhaps you could do likewise for me?

Yeah, unfortunately nothing has been received by the GDAX account I was sending it too, so I'm just stuck in no mans land for a few days until it's cancelled, or finally gets through
