I made it all the way to $11 on eth!

Too true. Ether and litecoins success are incredible. I got nervous and bailed on ether at $11.

I imagine adding more coins will help them continue to grow.

I just assumed they were preparing to launch their own crypto.

I've been around for a bit. $11 for an altcoin that wasn't litecoin was crazy.

I'm not saying the tax rate is 60 and 40% but rather I read any sale of Bitcoin is taxes as 60% long term and 40 % short term capital gains. I can not find the source so take it with a grain of salt.

If bitcoin is a property, per the IRS, won't he be paying payroll taxes and capital gains taxes when he switches to fiat? This seems like a bad idea.

My father in law has been talking about how he's going to short it since it was at $700 again.

Maybe if you're mining Bitcoin.

IRS has stated that bitcoin is a property and subject to the 60/40 long term short term capital gains taxes. I don't think you want to get paid in bitcoin as you'll incur an additional tax on top of payroll taxes.

This is already over my head lol, I'm sorry. I just use bitcoin.tax and I've only bought and sold btc.

Those two sentences don't even make sense together.

My brother took his own life as well. I'm sorry, so very sorry.

Well if you pay taxes on your earning twice you end up with less...

I didn't watch and I won't. But if it's real this man needs to be in a padded room.
