I'm not sure, I would encourage you to conduct your own research and report back here.

I'm not sure, I just found it a couple minutes ago so I decided to post it here, did I break a rule?

You can sign up on your laptop, and download it onto Chrome, or you can sign up on your iDevice or Android, and download it onto that. The interface is really easy to use from my experience (which isn't that much since I only downloaded it an hour ago). As for the transaction fees, I haven't made any transactions yet, mainly because I haven't felt like it, so I would not know about those. Unlike blockchain.info, I have not found a way to import private keys, but it is in the beta stage, so this feature may become available as development progresses. It is a good wallet overall imo, since it is free atm. However, it still needs to incorporate features that are available in the blockchain app.
EDIT 
I contacted them asking about the importation of private keys, will update when they respond.

I joined for free somehow... Now I have an iOS wallet on my iPhone so i'm happy, just wanted to share my joy with others. Did not mean any harm :)

They responded, and say that the importation of private keys is being worked on, and will definitely come out in an update in the near future.

First thing you need to do is at least get them on a desktop wallet... multibit or the default bitcoin wallet is fine, then google "how to cold storage bit coin" which has already been said.
