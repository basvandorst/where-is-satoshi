Cryptosteel is made of ANSI304 - our production tools are designed to cut this exact type of steel. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 16:02:42
it will, but after long period of time - very, very long
@_date: 2016-08-28 17:34:17
Hello, 
If you are thinking about material consider Steel ANSI304 or ANSI430. 
Keep in mind that by punching single plate of metal sheet, your Seed is always visible.  
@_date: 2016-04-25 07:41:15
I am really happy that our product give you joy and satisfaction. And we cross our steelfingers that you will never be in need to recover from **"the master of all backups"**
@_date: 2016-04-25 07:32:49
Cryptosteel is **open-source**. So you can build your own steel wallet **copy-left**
We will soon publish blueprints.

how about scanning your brain after 2 pounds of THC + Snowball and opiate cocktail? How about those who are addicted to Valium and Prozac? How about those who work in stress - like a day-traders?

Cryptosteel provide a BASE64 set of letter tails.

I would rather say, that assembling Cryptosteel is like a Scrabble - you create your sentences by placing tales. 
So you can correct yourself with ease. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:14:17
Keep in mind that fire-proof is much more than fire-resistant.
(most of commonly used house safes are only fire-resistant)
Cryptosteel will survive 1200C/2400F it is much more than a this. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:22:54
Join the game :) 
Winner will grasp very unique  version! One and only in its kind! 
@_date: 2015-06-19 05:21:42
Yes, final product will be labeled with very tenous Crypyptosteel logo only. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:38:31
Lucky you! And Lucky your friends, who will have a customised Cryptosteel with your Logo or emblem - tell us, what will you do with them? Whom will you give it??? 
:) 
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:31:42
You can random it by picking up letters from a "hat" - yes, the Raw Hexadecimal Private Key do not have a checksum. Also you can have a Brain Wallet, or the best option is to store a Recovery Seed inside a Cryptosteel. 
Also - the manual will be composed mainly of pictograms. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:16:53
So true, so right!
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:08:53
I confirm - the whole project is Open Hardware/Source - and thanks to all of yours donation this is really happens! 
Final wallet will have a hole (5mm) - so any type of padlock, or other fastener can be used - if you like.

Hi  
This is the last option to pledge in to my project - and collect not only a limited edition, but also to be mentioned in a hall of fame. 
Thank you all!!! 
@_date: 2015-06-19 05:11:36
Yes! Exactly, protecting your Cryptosteel sentence with a classical cryptography (ROT13, Cesar Cipher, Tap Code...ect.) is a very wise idea. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 05:12:09
We are acting step-by-step. Your suggestions overlap our thoughts, and assumptions :)
@_date: 2015-05-07 19:29:41
this version will be extended - not neuterated 
@_date: 2015-05-20 05:08:18
This artefact can hold any private sentence up to 96 letters long - eternally. No software, unplug, private, stainless.
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:30:11
Our initial assumption was to use Lighhouse - we choose Indiegogo, because we believe that winning campaign on mainstream platform will bring more attention not only to Cryptosteel, but also to the whole Bitcoin community. 
Additionally Indiegogo is positive for side donations - you can pledge in BTC via Mycelium GEAR - without registration. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:39:06
Indeed - images comes from several prototypes. Final version will be mechanical press stamp engraved, each side. The emboss depth will have ~0,08mm 
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:38:14
Thank you for your support!
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:38:51
Yes, we will make it more mainstream. ;) 
@_date: 2015-05-20 04:42:25
Until now we collect about 2.5BTC and $350 - Thanks to yours support we can make it! 
@_date: 2015-05-21 07:07:48
On outer edge, you will find a hole. You can string any thing you want: Paracord, or padlock, or hook. Or you can use a nail to tack it with a single nail, or screw.
But we do not want to create a false sense of security - that some kind of lock will protect your assets from scrutiny. 
One shall protect it proportionate way to its value. I believe that the best way is to avoid parade of infixed Cryptosteel. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:42:51
With 8BTC and $5500 we are less than $500 to win! 
@_date: 2015-05-22 11:46:41
I receive your payment - THANK YOU XHOZHO !
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:05:50
You shall arise, call, stump up, and walk! 
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:59:04
Cryptosteel is made of ANSI304 Stainless Steel. 
Also - together with SatoshiLab we belive that compination of Cryptosteel and Trezor (Mnemonic Seed) is the best solution.
@_date: 2015-05-20 03:06:06
If you use Seed - you can store your Master Seed with Cryptosteel
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:19:59
Cryptosteel have a hole from the very beginning. You can string any thing you want: Paracord, or padlock, or hook. Or you can use a nail to tack it with a single nail, or screw.

Indiegogo video shows first prototype of Cryptosteel. Our project is still in development and after successful campaign we want to deliver solution to meet users expectations. 
We are Open Source/Hardware
@_date: 2015-05-20 02:54:04
Cryptosteel is going to happen only with users acceptance 
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:36:03
We did not notice it. All is fine. Bitcoin contributions overstep 10.3BTC
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:15:19
Within first 24h  donations overstep 6,3BTC! Combining  founds we pass 50% of our goal! This campaign will soon go down to history!
@_date: 2015-05-20 02:30:04
24 words - full Mnemonic sentence
@_date: 2015-05-21 07:13:41
Sorry- this are not a donations! This is linguistic abbreviation. 
All contributions are linked with a rewards, and as it is indicated Indiegogo Campaign have Fixed Founding - so do Bitcoins Contributions - in case of failure, all founds will be pay back in full. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 07:15:14
This version will allow you to hold 96 letter sentence - compared to 64 in a previous version. Also new set of letters will be both sides engraved, giving you much more possibilities to setup your private sentence. 
Cryptosteel roots came from a small metal manufacture - without Open Source nature of this project, we would not have been able to solve a bunch of cryptographic problems, SatohiLabs solves. 
I encourage all of you to follow our crowd-founding campign. Please sign-up at  , and do not miss Early Bird opportunity. We need your support to make it happens.

Hello Assiehash, 
We have to close a first goal and then we will think about additional streach goals. 
But we know that users need HEX letters - and this upgrade is on our short list. 
I receive your pledge! Thank you! 
Bitcoin donation are warm welcome - BTC Pledges are not automatically added to the campaign. 
We post updates manually with a slight delay. 
MyCelium GEAR system works like a charm! 
All Bitcoin payments will be confirmed with a separate e-mail.

“The best steel doesn't always shine the brightest.”

@_date: 2015-05-20 06:53:18
Thank you very much for your opinion. 
Me and my team made several surveys. We discover that Bitcoiners are constant looking for something physical. (Caucasius Coins, Wooden Wallet, Mint Bitcoins, Laser engraved QR codes, and so on) 
People needs to feel it. We like to touch. 
You can give it to someone. You can keep it for your own. 
It is much easier to imagine how to protect something physical, than virtual-things. 
Cryptosteel isn't designed to be carry inside your pocket. This artefact should be kept in safe place. For example in safe, or strong box, or build inside a wall, or bury in a field. 
And you can keep as many copies of your Seed/Key as you want. Some on paper, some on clouds, and one made of steel. You can use it as you like. There is no handbook nor instructions. There is no software, or algorithm. This is just a simple tool. As simple as dogtag, or printing press.
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:16:39

THANK YOU ALL MY FRIENDS AND FANS FOR PROOFING WE ARE NOT SCAM! 
This project is very-very hard. hard-ware. hard-core. 
hard-steel. 
We do not have enough resources to answer mails! Believe us- we are working all day long on the production! 
Production Phase is finished TODAY and ALL pending orders will be dispatched soon! 
@_date: 2016-06-28 15:21:56
our web-shop is not ready yet - but fully functional
Somebody find our web-shop **underconstruction** and past link to Reddit! 
First we will finish Indiegogo campaign- then we will lunch the official openning. Very soon - very soon! 
Cryptostel decided to go [online!]( because we have learn that the best way to act is to jump into deep water. 
We are both testing it, fixing, coding and create content - at the same time. We will announce the grand opening 1st of July. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 07:37:50

Cryptosteel accept Bitcoin payments :) from the very beginning. 
if you log into OpenBazaar - we have our products available there only with Bitcoins
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:10:14
Clear and fair explanation! 
@_date: 2016-06-28 15:17:43
Right now we are one bridge to finish Indiegogo campaign. 
All pledged units was shipped to EU customers last week.  
The final bunch of Cryptosteel units was shipped today to Canada and then will be divided and shipped to customers by USPS. 
We only try to find the best way to deliver our wallets to **Oceania.** 
It is passible that Australian and New Zealand customers will have to wait a week longer.  
We gain over 500% demand for Cryptosteel, and we work days and nights to fulfil the orders. 
The main reason why Indiegogo are postponed over others orders is this that:
*1. Indiegogo units are customised. 
*2. most of undelivered orders are from US and Australia - and we are working hard to speed up the shipping process. 
*3. we have a total mess after the the initial orders was lost - and the recovery mode is double-or-triple times harder to finish. 
*4. I cover all the cost for second shipping, replacement units, additional tax and duty - from those orders listed above. 
I believe that Cryptosteel eventually pass a tipping point and we will be able to flow flawlessly soon. 
Thank you for your patience. This is thrilling experience, to be here and develop Cryptosteel- from very beginning, day-by-day, from scratch to final product. We love this work. 
PS. We are trying to answer all emails, you can always contact us via PM, TT, or FB.

Cryptosteel is designed as a master of all Backups - there is no need to use it every day. This is a final bulwark. 
BIP039 is designed to keep only **first four letters of each word** There is no need to protect all sentence:

We are shipping only Cryptosteel rev.2 cassettes. (since Dec16) 
@_date: 2016-06-28 15:36:56
send steel bar! you win at deadpan! 
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:06:22
Cryptosteel rev.2 is much better crafted, shiner, and finished. We completely redesigned our production line to eliminate any possible sharp edges, elements, or mishaps. 
Since our blueprints are available as [OpenHardware]( we deem that together we will make this project better product. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 11:22:50

What a nice surprise! Thank you 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:34:26
I am always taking my Cryptosteel with me when I travel, to check airport Security routines. I can not ask officers to answer my questions (they are not allowed to talk) but, I never had an issue, with security check.
More over, Letter tiles are double sided, and when Cassette is closed, Letters are face -up-side-down-. So, even if the scanner will be able to see thru the metal, it will see four characters one on top of another. I am pretty sure that this will be impossible to read sensitive content. 
As far I can tell, I only saw black rectangular shape on Security x-ray screen. They never ask what is this. (except one time, when I had 12 units inside my personal luggage, and I told that those are kind of metal puzzle-game) 
From other users feedbacks I can tell, that they never had examination, or personal-check of the cassette. 
But I can't say nothing fully trusted in this topic.
