ooo conspiracy 
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:17:29
fun fact bitcoin transaction fee is 30 dollars...
@_date: 2018-01-24 06:50:02
no money is not a illusion money is the GDP of the country 
200,000K GDP and 100,000 sheets of 1 dollar paper the money is worth more then 400,000 sheets of 1 dollar paper, it actually has a value and thats why unemployment has a direct correlation with currency collapse 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:26:26
fucking stupid miners who mine the failing currency of bitcoin, bitcoin is not gonna go to 100K so stop dreaming.
etheruem is a better cybercurrency because it doesnt have the shortcomings (high transaction prices and hardware based mining) of bitcoin
plus why the fuck do people still use gpus for mining??? they are not as good anymore and you spend 10K on gpus and end up with 5K profit over a year
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:09:14
does it really matter??? you can still buy stuff? why the goverment care if you buy some bread and a apple.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:16:37
and what is bitcoin??? its money out of nothing, honestly the only reason why its even valued so high is the recognition AND GPU mining is expenisive
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:14:11
most banks in russia are state owned...
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:32:40
product *IS* money as it can be exchanged for currency of the same value of the product of that time, and no money would have no value if the country that it is representing has no value, ya ever think why the european union has a economy requirement to use the euro?
and countries lie and euro goes down?
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:17:42
do you even know how russia is like?
its a democracy like any other country and sure its kinda corrupt and is a oligrachy it still has to satisfy the people 
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:12:25
wow money out of computer processes???? and you think it will stay at 37K dollars per coin for long??? its only value is recognition and the fact that its hard to get
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:07:11
honestly what do you mean by "illusion" there is no illusion money is money and its worth something because it is still backed by something, even tho its not a pot of gold its still something
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:08:30
Pretty sure it counts as royalties and therfore not taxed here.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:50:34
I always thought Microsoft was private
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:48:28
yeah i give up, lucky man who finds it i salute you.
@_date: 2018-05-08 04:17:03
Yeah, I agree. There are bad corporations and good ones.
@_date: 2018-05-15 05:14:15
Bitcoin depends on supply and demand tho. It snot very stable honestly.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:01:34
Why you dislike corporations :( sure we want to earn profits but alot of us care.
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:23:51
Wrong. You forgot console gamers that only know how to start a game on their Xbox.
@_date: 2018-05-04 07:40:05
Hope they implement it in more places, it's a good way to avoid bank surcharge and income tax.
@_date: 2018-05-05 07:39:53
I think it would be best to store them on your forehead
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:46:44
I just saw "rat poison to corporate mongers" and I immediately thought anti-corporate :/
@_date: 2018-05-12 00:09:17
Because you supply him money to do it and you make a contract xd
@_date: 2018-05-05 08:22:11
I hope.. need to be able to buy more stuff with bitcoin instead of cashing it out.
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:57:52
Problem is, we are not sure about the future of bitcoin unlike his company that is doing well for years. But this boi can buy all of the bitcoin available on the market and still have 90% or so of his company reserves left. However that would make bitcoin prices skyrocket into the the hundreds of thousands.
@_date: 2018-05-06 04:54:46
I have lost all my money too
@_date: 2018-05-04 07:42:31
Seems legit
@_date: 2018-05-05 08:24:51
Harder to manage corporate taxes and the price fluctuations.
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:06:30
No. I just thought Microsoft was a privately owned company, guess it was kinda stupid to think that given how large it is.
@_date: 2018-05-11 18:48:55
Don't trust them.
@_date: 2018-05-01 23:27:43
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:03:47
I agree, I'd invest in other things.
@_date: 2018-05-05 08:17:37
And? Isn't bitcoin supposed to replace banks..
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:48:33
Obviously only want their own benefits. If less people but then there is less demand and prices go way down.
@_date: 2018-05-15 22:19:04
Money doesn't depend on supply and demand. If you earn all the US dollars in the world the value of those dollars won't go up. They will just print more.
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:52:03
Well it's good for me. I honestly hope bitcoins mass adoption is delayed until I can get some real funds onto it.
@_date: 2018-05-01 23:27:04
Well it's useful for international transfers but you can use any crpyto for that.
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:08:20
Only solution is to buy military equipment and take control over a small country.
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:41:11
Lmao there isn't even that much bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:31:38
No, I have no friends
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:53:40
Should be a API somewhere...
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:31:23
@_date: 2018-05-05 08:23:57
And? I could sell mine for 20 million each and it spike but no one would buy it.
@_date: 2018-05-12 18:32:34
They aren't too expenisve, depends on the location. For example time sqaure costs thousands a minute.
@_date: 2018-05-11 23:50:29
I'm in Cusco rn too
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:13:03
I mean, if I was him I'd say "y'all don't invest in this bitcoin fad it's all fake and low returns" that way he will drive the prices down by making people not buy it and therfore demand is less. Then I'd scoop up the whole bitcoin market (since he can) and be able to drive the prices to the millions potentially and sell them at a slow rate.
@_date: 2018-05-11 18:59:20
KIM SELL SELL SELL!!!
@_date: 2018-05-13 06:42:34
What about Russia, their bank is state owned by Vladimir Putin himself lol
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:27:15
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:02:29
Bitcoin could hit 5 million in the next 5 minutes, it's simple. I but all the bitcoin supply and boucnr prices!
@_date: 2018-10-27 09:20:38
Bitcoin is a threat to the big banks. So countries with state owned bank institutions Russia, China, etc are less likely to react as much as other nations.
@_date: 2018-10-27 23:34:55
i dont get it? there's literally a official download for mac. At least they developed a version for mac, unlike apple that restricts their software to mac. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 21:48:01
On what?
@_date: 2018-10-28 01:18:17
finalcut mainly haha.
@_date: 2018-10-28 01:53:13
it's not harder 
@_date: 2018-10-28 00:34:36
im not sure. But dont you pay subscription on windows? anyways basicially all programs these days are subscription. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 06:50:22
sad that most people prob wouldnt notice 
@_date: 2018-10-31 03:42:50
probably even less honestly. Very little bitcoin users. If it was 30% there'd be bitcoin payment options in supermarkets. 
@_date: 2019-06-14 00:17:11
some hold up to 100K, in ireland there's these criminals that steal ATM's lol
@_date: 2019-02-01 00:08:59
hodl kinda gay, trading is where it's at, buy when low and sell when high, since bitcoin is so unstable :) 
@_date: 2019-02-09 01:10:30
yes, as many other people said before. History repeats itself. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:45:58
you cant actually hack AES 256 encrpyted data unlesse you have the key, it'd take too long to decode. 
@_date: 2019-06-06 04:22:38
i see another great depression happening. Around 100 years from the previous one. Unsustainable debt in alot of western nations, incompetent leadership that think nothing is gonna happen, Useless trade wars against countries with a much stronger economy. etc.
@_date: 2019-02-09 01:11:40
that only means that some cryptos will die out.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:52:50
the power bill part is so true tho 
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:40:58
i kind of doubt it'll be THAT much by only 2020. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:29:56
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:18:54
i dont own any. And many people have gotten quite a bit of money from this 
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:47:18
Bitcoin is going down fast :/ not sure of the future of it. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:30:30
Bro??? You low balling there. I say 100M.
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:34:55
dont be so confident, no one knows. 
@_date: 2018-11-05 16:05:45
I knew the prices back in december were way too good to be true. A bubble. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:57:00
Well, I, for one think 100,000 by end of 2020. But that's just a wild guess based of previous data But the next spike might be 500K+ 
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:35:12
this is a bit misleading, the adoption of a "currency" like this is because direct barter only works if you both have the items you want, With a currency you could buy something from someone and they could later trade the currency with someone else for the thing they're looking for. Bitcoin is still a currency. However in some ways better then traditional currency, It's not as big of a revolution as this. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 19:57:00
how wrong were they.... the game was released in 2014 when bitcoin was in it's dollars. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:43:27
damn 75 btc 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:06:53
true. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:51:21
more like 20 cuts of it
@_date: 2018-11-16 01:07:16
bitcoin irl at december peak 
@_date: 2019-01-29 04:32:30
Hmm, i think i'll consider. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 04:18:46
well, like any nation. You have to have the right passport. Isreal is already fake, half their nation is arab. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 04:17:19
isreal is insanely corrupt. Well not compared to their neighbours :/ 
@_date: 2018-11-24 09:56:23
Well then that's just plain misleading. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 13:02:18
Because of how Blockchain works? Idk besides, as better ways to decrypt things arrives the encryption gets stronger. Just the cycle of most things.
@_date: 2019-01-16 00:10:15
And then we use quantum encryption
@_date: 2019-01-29 10:18:03
ok, i'll just invest some money for now every so often. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 08:48:28
i hope to get onboard asap, probably early next year tho, i dont think there'll be a major price spike soon. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:43:08
a HODL'ers wet dream 
@_date: 2019-01-14 04:19:12
well, like any nation. You have to have the right passport. Isreal is already fake, half their nation is arab. And as we know the two groups dont exactly get along.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:08:59
no they fucking dont m8 there is no conspiracy that goverments want to know how much money a average loser has.
and if you did have alot of money you influence the goverment through bribery. there is no goverment in the world with no corruption 
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:50:50
funny meme 
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:53:43
you know i understand you on this one, but bitcoin you still have to pay transaction fees 
@_date: 2018-04-30 03:05:51
A millionaire is someone who's net worth is more then a million. That's easy. Also scarcity isn't value, but I guess I'll be using bitcoin for international company transfers anyways. We'll see. But bitcoin isn't even the only crypto. It's only value is popularity.
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:55:56
No that's what the goverment uses to buy stuff.
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:36:45
Lmao why you think bitcoin will ever be over 100k 
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:24:55
Hyperinflation is completely different.
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:59:44
Go away middle aged men this meme is dead stop disturbing it's grave
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:32:17
Nsx is cheap tho.
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:56:27
Do a fucking economics class and you will know that isn't true. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 04:37:12
No, I perfectly understand what Blockchain is. But it's not really a technology that's useful when it's transaction fees are high and most programs to easily manage coins generally get hacked or are scammed. I think the banks are still ok.  I'd rather store my money in gold, the most stable and reliable way to store wealth.
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:20:48
You might not know alot about how companies work but that's ok, crypto currency isn't a advantage. It infact is a disadvantage, a buisiness bank account allows unlimited money transfer for free and you only have to pay a small fee per month. Bitcoin transaction fees are way higher and don't allow the constant cash flow of corporate accounts. And don't even mention how much crypto fluctuates, a currency such as the USD stays at a constant value for a much longer time and therfore more preferable.
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:48:56
That's not how economics works
@_date: 2018-04-30 20:20:12
Bitcoin isn't gonna be the global currency. That 19k was from popularity and demand
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:08:03
Dial up worked....
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:40:37
Smh screw bitcoin.. seems like a fad.
@_date: 2018-04-27 04:47:10
That's pretty bad logic. It's like saying the Lamborghini espada is not a Lamborghini because it was unpopular.
@_date: 2018-04-29 05:50:24
How fucking baked are you
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:50:35
Program your own software, simple. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:48:59
You can't avoid taxes. Unless syou live on jersey or something.
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:37:32
I agree, money by itself has no value. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:44:01
Computers existed since ww2... And cell phone seer epopular in late 90's. Also bitcoin isn't gonna be the main crypto. I think there will be a combination with multiple crpyto currencies and cash for daily use.
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:10:50
Is that TAX free zone I hear? 
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:30:53
I wish I could buy a house with bitcoin, no taxes is nice.
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:29:39
Do what the cool kids do, store them in notepad. I'm not trusting some edgy program.
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:38:52
Yeah you contribute to it and you get to buy other things.
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:54:42
Does no one in the bitcoin community know where money gets its value??? The goverment backs it with the GDP of the nation.
@_date: 2018-12-01 06:49:37
lol i agree. This is the chance. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:51:06
