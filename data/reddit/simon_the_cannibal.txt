I think I'm officially on the side of listing things as mBTC.
I started doing it in my own accounting (for alt coins) and it's so much easier. If an exchange (e.g. Coinbase) were to start, I think we'd see some psychological barriers broken as well (oh, a mBTC is only $16? That's a steal!).

The Moon Boobies appreciate it!

Apparently this is considered spam :(
Maybe I should have titled it with the current price on an exchange?

I meant to keep one when I was there :(
Having fun in Chinatown? The reggae bar is the cheapest spot for drinks if you get the backpacker special.

My thoughts as well - sell a percent to realize the gain, but don't sell everything and leave the game!

They do make it nice - "oh, 75% of my holdings are BTC / ETH / LTC? Let me tap exactly once to see all three"

Well, +0.00000001 at the very least :P

Call *me* old fashioned, but isn't a meme just a propagated idea, behavior, or style?
e.g. comic strips in and of themselves are memes created in the early 20th century.

100% with you

People are super afraid of debt. They don't understand what money in your pocket / invested is actually worth.
Illustrative example:
$10,000 loan at 10% over 10 years: I pay a total of ~$16,000.
$10,000 investment at 10% over 10 years: I earn a total of ~$27,000.
If I had paid off my loan immediately, I would have "saved" $6k at the expense of $11k.

But this is the internet - where men are children, women are men, and children are the FBI.

If only I could remember my personal PIN number...

You mean USD $121k thousand dollars, surely.
Now to find that automatic ATM machine to cash some out! :P

Good catch! What would it be in Canadian CAD dollars?

I thought I was being *extremely* obvious. The parent post said "$121k dollars", which translates to "121k dollars dollars". Hence my over-the-top rib at the redundancy, *complete with a tongue out emoji*.
I'm honestly disappointed I'm still getting replies. I'll accept downvotes (it was a mediocre joke), but if people didn't get it (and feel the need to correct me!?), well, they're far too dumb to be dabbling in crypto.
