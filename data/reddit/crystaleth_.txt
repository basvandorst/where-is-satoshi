To show the power of the public Ethereum blockchain

Yes it did, as it was morally the right thing to do as well as what the community wanted. Bitcoin was designed to be 'digital cash', now it is ‘digital gold’. The way things are intended to be used are not always the way they turn out to be used. 
ETC does not have decentralised governance at all. It’s centralized around a few devs who generally have bad ethics and are censoring the ETC Reddit, just like Bitcoin is doing in her subreddit.
I challenge you to make a change on the ETH ledger atm. It’s close to impossible. With the ETH users and ecosystem growing, it becomes more and more unlikely that a transaction will ever be changed. POS transition will bring even more finality to the system.

And bitcoin was never meant to be digital gold, but peer-to-peer electronic cash. That's just the latest change of perspective to fit into the reality of an expensive and (relatively) slow system to transfer value. In hindsight Bitcoin seems like a proof of concept for Ethereum, which can do the same as Bitcoin, next to a lot more. 
No offence though, Bitcoin is magical and will always be respected. I just think that accepting and supporting progress in the crypto space is a good thing. This instead of trying to clamp onto old believes and trying to make things work the hard way, while there is an easy way.

No system in the universe is perfect. Go with what works and good ethics instead of creating an anti network effect.

Bitcoin was the proof of concept for Ethereum you mean.

Crypto is about giving power back to the people instead of a few ones with privileges and hidden agendas. In the DAO hack, people who got stolen from were refunded. This is the opposite of a bail out, where a party that f*cks up is compensated with money or resources from innocent people such as tax payers. In other words, the DAO hack showed the power of a blockchain: the consensus of the users decided which way to go, instead of a small centralized group of people like in legacy systems. (Please don't start the carbon vote argument as everybody could choose to support ETC which very few ppl from the ETH community did)
