The naked truth behind altcoins.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:21:43
It might be so. Having simpler, more solid, methods of exchange could be an upside for btc. Decentralization and never doing trust deposits longer than it takes to close a sale has a certain attraction. 
High risk derivatives and high frequency trading on poorly coded amateur exchanges is clearly not the future. And it's not clear that they are needed. The world survived before derivatives. And there are other less casino like methods of risk trading.

Bitgo allowed their name to be used.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:58:22
Mostly bitgo. Finex already knew they were swiss cheese newby amateur hour, so they went with bitgo because this is bitgo bread and butter, their whole raison detre.
If bitgo keys did the signing, then bitgo is worthless, and possibly subject to a negligence suit. 
Both firms together can't afford to cover this loss, so perhaps both go under.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:59:53
If that was the case it would be the same as not using bitgo at all. If that was the setup, then bitgo allowing their name to be used was a fraud on the public.

Am address is not a wallet. All deposits were conmingled, by definition, because they had the same defacto owner combination, bitgo and bitfinex.

No, I'm saying you do not cut off your nose if the fed tries to regulate stank.

  They chose not to.

If they dont validate change destinations, well that is a mac truck sized bug in their logic.

Or more precisely, if they don't already know why they need it, then they probably don't need it. 
I don't think it will spread by trying to convince people. Bitcoin spreads when it is the best way to do something. Average people just go with the flow. They'll use bitcoin when they don't have much choice.

No, but he invented two key technologies, the "hearnia", and the famous "whiny ragequit".
Bloom filters are rather a drag on the network, current best practice is to disable them. So in summary: parasite drag, opening exploitable holes in full nodes, no assurance of correctness, and no privacy so spv nodes using bloom filters pretty much fail at all design goals.

The public common inheritance of earth is a non sense phrase. It doesn't even have a meaning. 
The only one advocating theft here is you, and yes it is socialism even though you won't acknowledge it. 
You would deny people the exclusive right to their own bodies, homes, and other properties by the use of aggressive violence.

Don't use single addresses, when you can make a real wallet with dice pen and paper.

@_date: 2016-08-04 23:39:35
If you were right, which you are not, then there would be no point in multisig or bitgo whatsoever. You either have no understanding or else you carry water for bitgo.

Nazis are socialist, but this does not mean they were not also partially capitalist. The same argument covers the usa. The brecon wall was definite evidence of the superiority of caoitalism.
And venezuelas collapse has nothing to do with oil. That's like blaming poverty on being born rich.

That is a perfect example for deregulation. If you were right, everyone would be earning minimum wage, but they are not.
So it is a useless law that only causes unemployment for no good reason.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:41:19
Apparently they signed 120k btc of bad transactions. So the key was by definition not secure.
@_date: 2016-08-29 13:34:05
Deregulation is good, how can you oppose that ? What they want is increased regulation, which is bad. You also have some crazy concept of job security...laws don't make jobs secure...
@_date: 2016-08-30 03:28:28
The value is set by what the employees work is worth, not the minimum wage. If you pay less someone else will see benefit in hiring your employees.
Minwage doesn't raise anyone's salary, it just makes it illegal to employ people who's work is worth less than a certain amount.

Small correction, leave $0 on the exchange to avoid unknown retroactive tax implications. You may be asked to prove something later on and have no method of doing so.
Also, better to avoid identity verification. You can always self identify for tax purposes, and no exchange is secure enough to trust with your full personal identity and ssn. It's better to use an atm or libertyx which have more friendly tracking than exchanges.
@_date: 2016-11-25 06:43:52

You should not do this, you are following a chain of outdated advice. Yes electrum seeds are non portable, but they are still better than paper wallets.

@_date: 2016-09-21 00:37:29

 It's perfectly valid to use dice pen and paper to generate a seed, but there are special steps needed for the last step.

Unless it is kept secret, code has no owner, and neither does the novel. You have no effective power to exclude others from it, even with copyright, it can never be property.
@_date: 2016-05-21 23:25:49
Correct. There is no reason for a block to ever be less than 99% full. It would be a sign that the chain is idle and unused.
@_date: 2016-05-13 00:26:38
Source code cannot be bought. You can buy access to a copy, but you cannot own it anymore than you can own the number "five" or the idea of walking. 
Even if you obtain a government granted monopoly on counting to five, or a monopoly on walking aroung, you still don't really own those ideas.

Assuming it never leaks, you could say they have exclusive information. It's still not property, at least not in the conventional sense. Your password isn't property either.
Edit, it may be in fact soon upon us that all properties are owned via a secret, so I revise the above to concede that secrets are property. Cheers

As long as noone is stealing, or murdering, or controlling people with threats of the same, then you will have the best possible opportunities.
Capital is not evil, and it's a false boogeyman. The real boogeyman are orcs who steal. Sometimes with badges, sometimes without.
