They don't leave because of the violence, they leave because it is really difficult to find a good paying job, the minimum wage here is 52 pesos a day.
The torture videos are members of rival cartels, they are sending a message to the rival cartel and anyone that is considering joining them.
Yes people have died, but if you think that we just lock ourselves up you are wrong. I live in a lower middle class area in Juarez and the media seriously exaggerates. There are bad areas of town that you shouldn't be in at night and as long as you aren't involved in the drug game or a cop nothing happens. The murders here are: cops vs criminals, street gangs vs street gangs, cartels vs cartels. 
Mexico is a big country and you can't just say all of it is a war torn hell scape. I have been to Guadalajara and people are so calm there you can walk through the city at three in the morning and nothing will happen, Guadalajara is safe. Our state of Yucatan only has around ten related drug murders a YEAR. 
That's like me looking at how bad Detroit is and saying, "Oh the US must all be a poverty stricken gang controlled hellhole."
