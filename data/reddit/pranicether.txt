I hear you but a mortgage is not something I ever want to have and I would never "buy a car that's too expensive to save up for", lol.  
I'm actually looking for ways to consume less, cut down on what I have, and cut costs in any way I can.  I've already cut the cord (r/cordcutters) and I'm reading and learning more about self-sustaining practices.  In essence, I'm looking to move towards living as simply and enjoyably as possible...without excess.  I don't consider it civil disobedience.  But I guess I am taking a stand as a consumer.  I just can't anymore...can't consume as I have done as well as being taken advantage of by the system.

&amp; Are you serious? 
[But...but...oh nevermind](
lol, well, let's just say that at 40+ years old, I've had about enough of that type of living. And given the state of the world today, I'm okay with joining a farm or commune and living off the fat of the land for the rest of my days.  I don't want any parts of profit-making (of the nature you mentioned above) in my near future.  
Honestly, I think we could all do with a little "less" but I'm not one to throw my beliefs on anyone.  I would recommend that you be mindful with all the changes that are being made though. I think things are gonna get kinda crazy. This is just the tip of the iceberg.  Hope I'm wrong though.

I no longer keep any credit cards, only debit cards.  I'm not looking toward any type of loan...ever.  I agree about the whole industry being parasitic.

Hopefully, a consumer revolt as well.

Yeah, it's getting out of hand.
