I estimate it will touch 1000 again. Or not. Who fucking knows.

There is a Linux Mint Debian

It should include non anonymous transactions too, and what a hell, fuck bitcoin and why not keep using the same shit we made you use for decades uh?
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:54:13
But only if you have a bank account on the USA, which makes it useless for me... (for now)

I've used it several times for selling and buying BTC with cash, face to face. It's a good tool for finding people who want/sell BTC near you.

Using that same reasoning, how in hell can you trust money, with all the things you hear of it being stolen all around the world! So insecure!

I could use that app too then.

Very nice indeed. Hoping to see the spanish version soon.

You have the localbitcoins.com own forum for this kind of questions.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:49:04
You should visit @_date: 2013-11-21 17:44:16
Nope. I use Linux and I'm pretty sure of what I am installing.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:50:39
No, we just created a valley for you to buy (NOW)

I just heard this in my head with his voice:
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:19:41
20 years ago people paid you to give you their Bitcoins. Good times...
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:31:24
I didn't say it was bullet proof. I said I am not paranoid because I trust my system is quite secure, and I know about Linux enough to know what I am doing. Of course anything is 100% secure, but securing my computer is not one of my concerns when I go to sleep.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:45:38
Aaaand, that was it. Back to 1000. Yup.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:01:18
Really?? A blogger welcome page that jumps to some free forum site?
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:26:21
Seems interesting. A little more documentation/help wouldn't hurt.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:01:56
What kind of news would you like to recieve? 
The ones wildly screaming Bitcoin is the ultimate flawless revolution against all government and banking system, or the ones saying it's just a bubble about tu burst in the face of the few nerds that even know what they are?
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:45:36
It's against the rules of the subreddit to post that question.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:22:35
I am dissapoint by the lack of faith in Bitcoin of the programmers.
