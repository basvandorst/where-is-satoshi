I've never done it myself but maybe you wanna check out [this](
And if you try something like -salvagewallet, be sure to make a backup of the wallet.dat before you do so.

What amount of coins are we talking here? If it's a lot, you might wanna go to professionals.
But if you formatted the partition and probably used the harddrive afterwards it's pretty unlikely that you'll find something. You can try though, there is a lot of recovery programs out there.

oh nice! If you have the 12 words you can generate the private key(s) using electrum for example. [Just download it on their page]( open it, create new standart wallet and tick "I already have a seed".
You can also use any other wallet that supports the bip39 wordlist.(most do) Just look out for scams &amp; let me know if it worked

It's not 1:100. More like 1:10'000

Did you go through the whole verification process? Maybe you surpassed some kind of deposit limit.

This will be so much fun.

what do you need the x86 folder for?
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:48:41
Yeah, if you can recover your wallet.dat, you can restore your coins.

I'm sorry but if you don't have the private key or a seed, it's gone.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:37:34
I think it'll be a big rollercoaster. Lot's of fun ahead!

By passphrase do you mean a 12 word seed or just your blockchain password? 
There is no way to figure out the private key if you lost it. The address can be openly seen by everyone and gives you absolutely no power over the funds in it. You could add anyone's address as a "watch only".

Sorry, but it seems like the address wasn't generated with that seed. Without the specific seed for a wallet including the address you're looking for or the private key for it, there is no way to restore your funds.
