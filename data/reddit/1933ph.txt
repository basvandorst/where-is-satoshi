from the image, how do you get the key back out?
is it the private key that gets embedded into the image?
@_date: 2017-02-17 02:55:26
that's brilliant
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:00:44
exchanges and brokerages are logical temporary onboard ramps for fiat as well as speculation.  they do no harm to the longer term vision of an entirely bitcoin based economy where merchants no longer have to immediately cash out BTC for USD.  you're arguing a strawman.  Liquid, otoh, seems to be trying mask third party risk by attempting to make these sidechains a permanent and acceptable blockchain for long term commerce.  i don't that's going to work.
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:49:21
it's not going to work.  hiding behind some Moxi-Box HW device doesn't stop them from changing the ledger.  what i worry most about is them trying to trap all value into the federated sidechain while cutting off the mainchain.  sort of how the Fed cut us off the gold standard settlement layer back in 1972.

@_date: 2017-01-01 18:44:56
you really are an authoritarian, aren't you?  rewrite?  
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:39:40
the question i have is why even let banks get a foot in the door, so to speak, by tapping into Bitcoin's mainchain value via a protocol adaptor? 
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:41:43
by claiming miners are currently centralized, you imply that there might be a fix to be applied to alleviate this situation.  how about lifting the 1MB since i think that's facilitating centralization in China?  after all, there's no tx fee growth to encourage new mining pools outside of China to compete.
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:27:06
SOV and POW has been definitively shown to be the driving/motivating factors behind the security of Bitcoin's mainchain.  Those 2 key attributes are missing from Liquid's model.  Why should we trust them?
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:20:02


no, the counterparties are who are required to pay for the opening &amp; closing tx's, not the LN hub owner, who is only there to make the fees.
i suppose that it's lost on everyone here that we're talking about a layer 2 soln that is introducing all sorts of new variables both technical and economic to the system all of which are highly unpredictable.
@_date: 2016-12-16 23:02:21
the way i see it is, just like there appears to be hesitance for larger merchants like NASDAQ to enter Bitcoin by booking stock trades into OP_RETURN, there is hesitance to enter mining by miners outside of China.  why?  b/c the rewards are dropping every 4y and tx growth has peaked with the 2TPS capacity that we are stuck at b/c of the 1MB.  what company do you know dares to enter a risky competitive new industry with those types of metrics associated with it?
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:41:50
questions like this are intentionally dishonest. since you spend so much time here and on the other sub trolling.
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:35:49
i'd agree with that.  what do you think the value of a single BTC would be if Bitcoin gained worldwide adoption?
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:15:40


since fees are involved you can easily see how big leveraged players will come in to attempt to make money off this.  after all, what's essentially happening here is that LN is attempting to create a transfer of wealth from miners onchain to LN hubs offchain.  


which really is a terrible solution b/c monitoring services are not free and also creates another trust vector in the system that's vulnerable to attack.
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:02:23
that makes it worse.
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:32:19


you realize that makes no sense?  that goes against every law of economics i can think of.  a larger, more well capitalized LN hub can surely out compete and under price smaller, less well connected and less well capitalzied nodes.  esp when all it takes is to spin up a server.


when 0 conf was more easily accessible, coffee buys were practical and even safe.


like i said, the intent is nice but the practicality of hiring a monitoring service, let alone multiple one's that are supposed to "compete", is way, way beyond the capabilities or desires of the ordinary joe blow bitcoin user.
@_date: 2016-12-10 21:38:32
what do you mean by rebalanced?
@_date: 2016-12-11 18:00:26
prepare for failure
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:06:34
yes, with LN being intentional and PP being not.  and then, only sometimes.
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:37:31
likewise, you should stop pushing for smalller blocks.  is simply giving you an Uber version of them.
@_date: 2016-12-08 16:37:12
or, you misunderstand the subtleties of intimidation resulting from what's happening here.  while, at the same time, apologizing for it.
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:23:11


thanks for mentioning this.  i worry about this.
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:31:27
what?  creating another R3?
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:17:18
ok, "I" want to be the one to do the update.  capiche?
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:05:43
then it's an impractical design b/c centralized LN hubs will be the reality since they'll bring liquidity and the ability to realtime monitor.
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:22:02




miners should be very disappointed to hear you say this.
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:31:18
and you wonder why we never have productive discussion around here.
@_date: 2016-12-11 00:58:01
it's too bad you can't fool us that SWSF is nothing more than a blatant attempt to move users from regular tx's to the p2sh multisig tx's of LN via the preferential 75% discount.  we're on to you dude.  it ain't happening.
@_date: 2016-12-05 21:35:04
Then i would expect the miners to take advantage of the higher volumes by raising fees to make more profit &amp; throttle blocksizes to limit orphaning.  Especially if they get the sense that too big of blocks were beginning to hurt the full node network that they rely upon to maintain decentralization of their all important blockchain ledger.
@_date: 2016-12-06 18:58:04


which will vary depending on the miner.  that's the point of BU; let individual miners decide on what their minimum fee to accept will be.  and there will be a minimum because each will have a different risk tolerance for orphaning.  the HK mining panel had both KNC and f2pool say flat out that they would not accept 0 fee tx's and would impose minimum fees on all tx's.  as they should and i believe them.  the fee market will converge to some minimum without a limit.
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:30:21


you're kidding me, right?
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:22:34
tell us how you really feel about miners.
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:37:11
why would anybody be interested in running a fee-less data hogging full node when they can instead run a fee-generating LN hub?
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:01:50
to expect an ordinary joe blow to open and close a pmt channel with a potential adversarial counterparty and go thru the hassle of self monitoring it 24/7 is impractical.
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:02:36
they could but you don't want them doing so.  POW is THE critical piece of Bitcoin that ensures it's security by tying it's costs to a real world resource.  any diminution of the fee incentives going towards POW is a diminution of Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:43:02
nope what?  recipients need to monitor for the life of the channel 24/7 so the sender doesn't try to settle on the blockchain with a previous out of date tx.
@_date: 2016-12-11 17:58:44
haha, reduced to simple minded adhoms now, eh?  you really don't understand Bitcoin do you?  
@_date: 2016-12-17 16:25:23
obviously they do
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:42:54
b/c you can't be cheated by a counterparty with keys in Mycelium.  and you don't have to monitor your wallet 24/7.
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:38:38
you're mixing apples and oranges.  with LN, you have to lock your money inside the hub for an indeterminate time.  i don't see PP requiring any of that.
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:36:31


you're just being disingenuous then.  after all the debate here and on Twitter, you clearly have heard all the reasons *why*.  i guess you just don't understand them.
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:38:01
so with an avg of 2000 tx's per block, that's $20000 in fees per block.  so miner income tops out there all the while their rewards go to zero?
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:34:13
are you talking about LN hubs?
@_date: 2016-12-05 18:52:03
Where would all the tx's come from to create those big blocks when miners do in fact enforce minimum fees and when their main emphasis is block rewards?
@_date: 2016-12-17 02:01:55




well, it doesn't have to be that way.  a certain small group just needs to get out of the way.
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:16:18
except that it's required.
@_date: 2016-12-09 01:12:28
lol, like the one where miners falsely signal SW support, yet once activation occurs, we find out &gt;51% of them have colluded to rerun 0.13.0 and steal all funds that have been sent to ANYONECANSPEND addresses.  you're right!  that sounds entirely predictable!
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:57:07
that's the hope but i doubt the reality.
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:22:56
you collecting LN fees makes it worse for miners.
@_date: 2016-12-07 00:59:35


why would you expect an asymmetry in connections?  right now, we have small and large miners alike connecting to the relay network and monitoring each other via stratum.  in fact, who's to say that smaller miners may have chosen out of their own internal priorities to buy the highest speed internet connections in existence to maintain these types of intimate connections with larger miners that you speak of?
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:00:05
i understand perfectly.  what you just stated is a problem for payment channels making them impractical.  do you understand?
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:39:47
at least you're being honest about the whole process.
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:24:50
so 1MB is great for you but 100kB is bad for me?
@_date: 2016-12-10 21:17:26


the key words there.  LN is an attempt to change Bitcoin economics.
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:26:07
but if the closing party doesn't tell the counterparty, it becomes an attack.
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:41:10


b/c who knows what can go wrong with LN.  you'll have to self monitor your coins yourself or thru a paid service to make sure your counterparty doesn't cheat.
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:32:41


just?  seriously, why should he have to talk around them at all.  this is serious business, so clarity should be desired one would think.
