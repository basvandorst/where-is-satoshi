Ignore history repeating itself at your peril.

You can only see a sustained rise in hindsight. Over the last 3 years btc has been fluctuating below the 400 mark. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:48:58
It doesn't seem you do either.

Bitcoin is unregulated at the moment, which is why it's been the currency of dark markets. Isn't that what everyone wants? Something that operates outside the financial system? You can't have it both ways unfortunately. People who think the price is on an ever upward tick are going to have to accept market manipulation is going to happen. 
Increasingly liquidity, by it's nature, makes it easier to move the price, as you can shift coin faster and sell offs can happen quicker. Reduced liquidity and slower transactions make panic selling harder. 
I feel like people who think Bitcoin is a new paradigm are going to get a lesson in finance.

Yes, what happened was you had what people claimed were revolutionary businesses, but then people realised that they actually didn't offer very much for their stratospheric stock valuations. They were all just built on people's rush to get rich quick by trading the stocks. 
It's good that we won't be caught out by something like that again...
Oh wait.

Also highly durable as a unit of wealth. Almost impossible to destroy by accident or misfortune. You need an intense fire to melt gold.

True elements of that story
Boss thought I was a moron. Got fired. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:27:52
Then don't, who is asking you to?
You're not checking the price daily anyway are you? If it dropped tomorrow by 99% of its value, you won't mind. You won't have lost anything.  
I took out my stake when my holdings doubled, I'm just riding on the profit now.

There are some people on here that are going to be in the shit big time if this goes bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:42:14
Yes, yes. Someone thought it was going to crash and it didn't crash, it went exponential as it became the latest get rich quick scheme that everyone is talking about.
But of course this soaring value shows that bitcoin the future currency...sorry, now the future gold standard, is a revolution in finance. The fact it's doing the exact thing every other bubble has done should be ignored. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:20:31
When futures really kick in, you'll see volume buying of bitcoin, followed by dumping to nudge the price and encourage panic selling where those with a short position will make money. 
Huge swings should start to happen soon. Those with a vested interest in futures aren't HODLers. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:07:49
Yes, because it's happened like that over the last few times it's bound to keep happening like that. 
Honestly, it's like some people around here walk around with a piece of straw between their teeth.

Zero chance it's working after years in a landfill.

Fine pair of crystal balls you've got there. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:33:58
If you all stick together and no-one withdraws their profit, then no-one will have made any money. There's no point being rich on paper and eating ramen at home. 
If I starts to drop, people will always break and try to crystallise their profits. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:42:01
What's the future for an investment that only ever goes up?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:11:32
Yes, the futures market itself will be regulated, but given the nature of bitcoin it's going to be very easy to pump and dump the bitcoin itself. 
Also the exponential rise at the moment has pretty much destroyed any value as a currency and any volatility from futures trading will make it a worse option. It's like having a market where goods vary hugely in price. Until we establish a solid baseline of value it's foolish to pay for anything directly in bitcoin.

Not for the people running the casino, up or down they get their cut. For them it's a win win
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:31:39
Shorting takes a lot of nerve. Probably more than I have. But it's definitely going to happen. Big players wouldn't be entering the market if they didn't think there was a percentage to be made from futures. 
My stake in Bitcoin is very low. I wouldn't want to cover a short position. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:41:42
In many ways it's exactly what the world has seen before. 
It's an asset class that's being bid up, that's attracting the interest of financial sharks with stuff like futures. But with all the added insecurity of hacks (60m missing yesterday), cowboys (the pump and dumpers taking advantage of the fact that bitcoin, unlike stocks is unregulated) and a faltering exchange structure (coinbase and GDax both struggling to cope with demand). 
It may well have been something different, but at the moment it's useless as a currency and it's just becoming a tool for people to get rich quick. 
Look at the transaction yesterday where someone bought and sold over 14,000 btc and made 200m 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:50:22
Futures trading is just a side effect of the huge hike in the price. 
People can smell there's money to be made acting as middlemen to feed off the bubble, at no risk to themselves. Trade the futures, take a percentage. 
Trading futures in something doesn't give the investment itself any legitimacy. You could buy tulip futures based on the potential future value of a tulip bulb.

That book only discusses the scale, it doesn't deny it happened. 
How about the Railway bubble, the south sea bubble, the dotcom bubble, the sub prime housing crash, didn't those happen either?
When something rapidly gains value and becomes the latest hot thing to put money in, it almost never ends well for most people. Some get rich yes, but most miss the peak and get crushed trying to get out. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:58:41
'Needless to say, the prices were not an accurate reflection of the value of a tulip bulb. As it happens in many speculative bubbles, some prudent people decided to sell and crystallize their profits. A domino effect of progressively lower and lower prices took place as everyone tried to sell while not many were buying. The price began to dive, causing people to panic and sell regardless of losses.
Dealers refused to honor contracts and people began to realize they traded their homes for a piece of greenery; panic and pandemonium were prevalent throughout the land.'

It's not being used a currency at the moment though is it?
What's the transaction volume for bitcoin in terms of goods and services, is it going up or down? And if it's going down and has shifted to being purely a store of value, why the exponential increase?
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:23:00
You're not HODLing because few places accept it. You're HODLing because the bitcoin you have is soaring in value compared to your domestic currency.

This is the photo they'll use when it crashes. 
It's the equivalent of the shoe-shine boy with the stock tips. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:00:15
I'm guessing you have bitcoin yes? 
What are you doing with that bitcoin now? Are you using it to buy things? Or are you holding onto it in order to make money in fiat currency?
Do you think people are out there buying pizzas with bitcoin right now? It's not a useful currency if the thing you're buying becomes radically more expensive in a week. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:25:02
Amazon were building a business in that time. 
Bitcoin is currently in the classic stages of an investment bubble. No-one is using it for anything other than speculating. 
This is bad.
