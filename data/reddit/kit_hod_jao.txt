Yup. the bubble to 1k USD convinced me BTC is going to happen. So I waited for the pop and then bought in after the Mt Gox price crash. 
This is exactly the same. But when you've lived through it before it's easier to relax and enjoy the ride.

Why do you think the words would be a valid seed? If they manually picked words, they would find it very difficult to make it pass the checksum. 
See my other post, I managed to find groups of 12 words, but none pass checksum.

OK I think I might be onto something derived from this list. There are exactly 12 words that are in the bitcoin paper AND in BIP39 that are oriented horizontally within the BTC logo, and exactly 12 additional words that are oriented about 40 deg. to the left.
These two lists of words are (sorted by order in which they appear in the whitepaper):
cash pool rely order next agree zero modify run race gap early 
problem proof attack since ability end entire know sign post fee find
If we use a 24 word seed, again, using the order in the whitepaper we get these lists (depending on which order you combine the two lists, or just all 24 words in the order in the paper):
 
cash problem proof pool attack rely since ability order next end entire know sign agree post zero modify run fee find race gap early
problem proof attack since ability end entire know sign post fee find cash pool rely order next agree zero modify run race gap early
cash pool rely order next agree zero modify run race gap early problem proof attack since ability end entire know sign post fee find
However none of these have valid mnemonics according to  and I've tried to enter them as BIP39 seed phrases in wallets without success. 
Here's a colour markup of all the BIP39 &amp;&amp; bitcoin.pdf words in GREEN:
Here's a spreadsheet showing the green words grouped by orientation:
Anyone got a clue from here?
I find it suspicious that I'm getting lists of 12 BIP39 words...

If we changed it to assume that if "you" had 1 channel to the network with sufficient capacity for coffee, what is the routing probability assuming that the coffee vendor is one of the nodes that has at least a coffee worth of capacity?
I feel like this is a more realistic test, because the coffee vendor accepting BTC wouldn't have channels that didn't support coffee, and the same for the coffee buyer. Whereas currently there are many people on LN experimenting with micropayments, who don't want to spend coffee-sized amounts.
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:28:58
Yes. My understanding is that the LN doesn't work very easily until the whole ecosystem of LN services is fleshed out. This includes things like mapping data (will help with routing by providing beacons) and channel rebalancing services, where a single on-chain tx will allow many users channels to then be rebalanced with a series of LN transactions. i.e. you pay someone (any way you want) to rebalance your channels.
@_date: 2018-06-21 03:30:56
Thankyou, this is perfect. I'm surprised it is so low. Do you have any insight as to why the routing fails so often? To me it implies the network is soft-partitioned into cliques, and routing between cliques is less reliable. Or, perhaps the network has sufficient capacity but current routing algorithms are not able to find the right routes. The latter seems surprising to me, since given the size of the network I'd expect to be able to find good solutions very rapidly (I'm experienced with scheduling/vehicle routing/ TSP / timetabling problems, which are similar in terms of constraints and typically much larger). 
@_date: 2018-06-20 02:51:56
My guess is that this number will be 95%+

So it's just a lag in the miner production-sales system? I'm worried someone is pumping the hashrate only to pull the rug out from under us after the next difficulty adjustment. The higher the average hashrate prior to adjustment, the more damaging it will be if hashpower is removed later.

It's not clear to me that they lost any. If they rode the pump, bought BCH cheap and sold it expensive, they could now be back with more BTC than they had to start with.
This ride could restart tomorrow...
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:35:25
Exactly, I can't see any reason in the near term for a dip. I was previously waiting for the segwit2x fork to cause a dip, then the BCH pump/dump for a dip, at which time I bought BTC (and BCH, stupid me). But now I don't have any reason to predict a dip, other than the meteoric growth past 6 months which you'd think would revert to the mean growth rate at some point. But BTC isn't a normal asset so this probably doesn't apply.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:02:50
It is hard to see through the FUD. Technically I do agree with some of their points - I'd rather have decentralized cash. That was what I bought into.
But it's also true that a layered system may be the only practical way to handle the volume of the world's transactions. 
I've been HODLing for years - bought in at $160 - but this is the first time I've had any doubt as to which is the right coin. 
Maybe I'm just a sucker for their fear campaign.

A lot less than I should've
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:31:41
The first thing is to separate your HODLing stash from your spending stash. Separate wallets on different devices. 
Then, make sure you're topping up all the time by converting more fiat to BTC so it's not a hassle and you don't have the feeling you're missing out on BTC gains by spending it.
Once you've got your HODL safely tucked away and your fiat salary -&gt; crypto pipeline is flowing, spending is actually easy and fun.
But you have to get those pieces set up.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:29:06
Weird thing is that I still get the same issues at off-peak times - e.g. the cloudflare error page or error messages in the UI saying that an order may or may not have been placed and to try again later. 
Something fundamentally broken there.

I believe this guy is legitimate and honest. I dug into his history on bitcointalk and he gave me good advice on another wallet cracking problem I had, even though I didn't use him in the end because I scripted the rules for the cracker myself. He's also been in this game for years.
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:05:42
This is a really interesting point - we don't know if we're getting closer to the destination or not! Still, without knowing more I'd expect LN devs have some ideas how to approach this. 
My first idea for this would be to define some metrics that can be shared between nodes. for example, min-hops-to-X%-of-net (i.e. how many jumps to be able to reach x% of the network.) We can use such metrics to move towards nodes that reach an increasingly large percentage of the network until we are on the trunk roads. 
It might seem hard to compute such metrics, but for any node it's just min( d( neighbours ) ) +1.
We can also avoid edges to nodes with low cardinality and/or low liquidity.
You can see how using such metrics a highway/local streets type network will emerge.
We could also use distance to "landmarks" as a way to trigger a local, exhaustive search to complete the routing. Landmarks could be nodes with particularly high uptime, age, liquidity and degree.  
When your node connects to the net, it can exchange some information with peers to establish its proximity to various landmarks.
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:07:46
I don't think you are right about that. Google maps recalculates routes based on the available traffic conditions. This means the road network changes on a timescale of minutes. Also, the number of routes is much to large to be stored. It's a much larger set than the number of places or roads. Now I'm not discounting the idea that Google Maps uses some caching of route segments as an optimization, but here's a post from 2011 from a guy who worked for Garmin saying they can basically solve this problem to a "good enough" standard just using A* search with clever pruning, and WITHOUT precalculated routes at all.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:33:06
actually they did think of something like my idea, except they call them beacon nodes!
@_date: 2018-03-16 08:50:50
You can't send every transaction to every host, but you can do e.g. a depth first tree search through the nodes. That will only hit a fraction of the nodes but will allow you to explore from the origin very rapidly. Also, once the routing is complete, the information can be discarded rather than retained forever.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:51:30
Thanks. And is this the correct way to count the number of transaction outputs over time (also down)?
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:32:22
Have you ever used GPS navigation? Mathematically it's the same problem. Graph structure formed by roads. Need path from A-&gt;B with various weights on the roads based on capacity, travelling speed, length etc.  
Find a route with minimum time or distance between any two locations... your phone can solve this in seconds across the road network of an entire country. It even responds to dynamic traffic conditions!
The solution is not optimal - indeed, that IS hard - but it's "good enough" and it's quick.
@_date: 2019-01-10 00:46:42
IMO it's more than useful - it's a critical piece of LN infrastructure, that unblocks scaling LN. Without these services, LN channel funding is dependent on on-chain transactions; everyone self-funds. With this service, on, off-chain crypto, even fiat transactions can expand the LN, allowing hundreds or thousands of channels to be funded with only a single on-chain transaction!

see other reply, I cashed out a little bit, kept most. Not that it's a huge amount compared to some folk! But it's become a big deal for me.
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:05:23
I'm really curious why it's not full anymore? Did coinbase add batching? Did someone stop spamming? I've seen plots showing the total number of outputs is more or less what it was Nov-Jan when the pool filled up.

@_date: 2018-03-16 04:29:12
uh .. isn't this the map?
Also not to nitpick but the GPS has a map of all the possible roads, but not a map of all possible routes between any two places. That would be enormous.

Exactly. Reasonable regulation is a good thing.

When I first got into Bitcoin, the price had just crashed from its all-time highs during the Mt Gox fiasco. I'd been watching Bitcoin for a while, considering it. The spike to &gt;1k USD was a sign to me that this thing had real value and had been battle-tested. 
So as soon as it crashed, I knew I had to be ready. 
When I bought in, my cash-out goal was $10k. I thought it was reasonable that Bitcoin could be worth 10k one day, possibly as much as 50k. That was the trade I wanted to make. I didn't have a timeframe in mind - years, a decade potentially. 
Now, 10k isn't a vague hope. I consider Dec/Jan a trial-run for just how big this thing could be. Basically the idea that it can reach those heights has now been proven. 
A recovery from 5 to 10 is easy, compared from the run from $100 to $1000 or $1000 to $10000. Might be months, maybe a year or two.
Still Hodlin'.

Can you back that up with any evidence?
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:46:51
I cashed out 3x my original investment, mostly from the BCH fork. At the time I was up 45x, so this barely affected my hodl.
I had planned to start significantly taking profits in chunks at 20, 25k over the course of this year, but the price has paused that plan! I won't cash out completely, but I will take chunks here and there depending on life events etc. I don't have that much!
I'm also planning to run a LN node this year when it's stable. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:11:03
That doesn't say that there should be no regulation of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:48:47
I like the empirical model - a real-life simulation as you say. I think it's good enough, if the simulation is done at small intervals of value etc; and although they're not explicitly modelled, all the variables that could possibly affect routing success are included implicitly. 
You could also show empirical failures breakdown by reason (e.g. channel imbalance). A good test would have e.g. 100 LN nodes scattered around the network, and then make random pairs between them. You'd have to decide how to handle channel balances between your test nodes and their adjacent peers as these are under the control of the experiment.
Now's your chance to make the definitive LN Coffee test :)
@_date: 2018-07-08 09:26:53
Ah I should've read more closely. The least correlated coins were all ones I'd never heard of, hence my comment. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 02:04:34
Original commenter from the previous thread I think this model better captures the essence of the BTC / LN "coffee test". I also think you're spot on that a formal definition of this metric is really important and could become a benchmark. So far there's no rules, but I think the assumptions here reflect better what a real-world coffee-buying experience would be. 
The numbers look sensible now - it reflects the general experience that we can expect small transactions to work relatively reliably at this point (if you recall, in the other thread I expected the number to be 95%).
I did *not* realize you were using average routing path metric in the results in the earlier thread. So i'm glad you brought that up.
One extension I suggest for this new metric is to introduce a probabilistic model for routing success. I notice you said that the chance of success is either 0% or 100% depending whether the routing succeeds.
I suggest displaying 2 headline figures - the current number you have, which says whether a coffee transaction is *possible*, another number which is the probability the transaction will succeed. For the latter, I suggest a conditional probability:
P(C) = P( R | E ) * P( E )
where 
P(C) = probability of drinking coffee
P(E) = Probability a route Exists with sufficient capacity, under conditions you have now (i.e. current .95 probability)
P(R|E) = Probability a successful route is established given the route exists
We just need a model for the last term.  
As routing algorithms improve, and additional LN hints become available (e.g. distance metrics), P( R| E ) will get bigger.

Should've excluded the ones with such low market cap that they're basically just playthings of pump-n-dumpers.
@_date: 2018-03-16 08:57:33
I see what you're saying, but ultimately our positions come down to shades of grey in the question of whether the map volatility overwhelms optimization heuristics.. I don't think we have the answers to this, but my gut feel is that it'll be OK. (Although "gut fees" are not reliable in this kind of thing, I've previously worked in machine learning applications for vehicle routing, rostering, timetabling and scheduling problems, so I have a bit of a sense of it). Don't ask if P = NP
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:04:42
The advantage is real in more diverse markets - decorrelating the risk that an unforeseen event wipes you out. But in crypto it doesn't make sense, as they're mostly BTC clones with minor tweaks - any systemic event will take almost all out together.
