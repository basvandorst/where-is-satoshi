+1 and thank you for your efforts!
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:01:19
Is This sarcasm?
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:20:36
I'm afraid that would be impossible... But I agree that there should be quicker and easier ways to purchase Bitcoins. But thanks to the Bitcoin ATM "revolution", it's getting easier.
@_date: 2014-08-10 11:58:44
Thanks, I'm using the 2.8" touchscreen from adafruit: 
It's connected to the GPIO in a transparent case (which I had to adjust in order for the screen to pop out)
@_date: 2014-08-10 14:28:02
Well it's actually the same thing and I'm trying to get used to the ISO name. I also recently bought a cool domain name with xbt in it :-)
@_date: 2014-09-01 08:09:32
If the prices rise as much as it did last year, it could possibly move up to or around the 1500 - 2000. But personally I think around the 940
@_date: 2014-08-15 07:24:33
Hmmm, little off-topic here... but... did Karpeles really registered his Twitter account in February 2009?
@_date: 2014-08-22 09:05:03
Thanks for the support! :)
@_date: 2014-08-10 12:03:29
It's quicker and cheaper to check the price on your smartphone. But the "XBTPITICKER" is fun to have. My wife is constantly yelling if the price is dropping or not. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:12:19
hmmm, I'll think about it..
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:22:32
I was already searching through imported csv's :) Also tried to price predict, but there seems to be an upload limit before Mr. Watson melts down :(
@_date: 2014-08-15 07:08:29
I'm also pretty convinced that they are part of a signature... But sadly pretty useless without the public address..
EDIT: Also a good possibility is that he is just trying to mess with our minds just for the fun of it. I guess that cat is getting pretty darn boring after a while...
@_date: 2014-08-10 11:48:12
Do you think there is a market for hardware Bitcoin tickers?
@_date: 2014-08-10 14:11:28
Obviously letting it play Thunderstruck from AC DC when hitting the 1000+ :-)
@_date: 2014-08-10 11:00:02
I finally finished it. Can now enjoy the realtime "last" price using the Bitstamp API. :-)
@_date: 2014-08-07 09:23:55
Well, I think you did a good job. As long as they keep getting the request of adopting Bitcoin as a payment method, they would start to seriously consider using it I presume?
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:49:58
Thank you for the links! The Willy Report was very interesting to read. I hope we'll ever find out what actually happened.
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:14:53
That's a good idea indeed. Ditching the anoying "physical coin" image, so media could also use pictures stored on the site.
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:34:43
We're always last in line :(
@_date: 2014-10-11 23:12:05
It's on bro! Let the games begin.
@_date: 2014-08-20 09:12:12
Indeed, that's why I started searching for addresses, couldn't find any. So tried to contact them over twitter, but I couldn't sent them a message without them following you. So I eventually ended up e-mailing Roger asking him if he could help me, and he replied.
It's really frustrating to find out, that if you're a 'bad guy', and you take a walk over street, they find you instantly. But when you're trying to help, it feels like you have to move mountains just to have anyone accepting your help... Having them appreciating your help is almost not-done these days.
@_date: 2014-08-10 18:54:23
Oh.. it will show a sad face and eventually self destroy :(
@_date: 2014-09-11 16:37:50
Done! :-)
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:34:39
Try it in IE? Or check your browser's security settings.
@_date: 2014-08-10 14:28:12
@_date: 2014-09-23 13:06:15
Great news! To bad the US still has to wait :(
@_date: 2014-08-14 13:16:55
Oh, so they already verified to which addresses these coins went to? I'm sorry I did not know that.
@_date: 2014-08-07 09:35:59
But why are people scared of a "Whale" dumping his coins and taking his profit? When "Whales" sell to eachother, the global price wouldn't be effected right?
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:18:44
How's the weather over there?
@_date: 2014-08-07 08:59:22
I wonder how many orders they've got during their opening. I've ordered 2 devices straight away!
@_date: 2014-08-22 09:03:23
Haha thanks! :-) I'm going to enjoy the drink tonight!
@_date: 2014-08-10 11:41:56
I'm using the Bitstamp API
@_date: 2014-08-10 11:50:56
Haha sadly no. But that's a good idea to have it *beep* when that happens. Maybe even change colors depending on the rising or falling of it's value. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 14:22:26
Unfortunately I only have this one :-( to actually create a bitcoin ticker I would have to use a smaller and cheaper board just like BaurusdB said. Maybe with some extra functions to include more different types of currencies. If there really is a market for these kind of devices then someone in or around the Netherlands could contact me and we'll check it out :-)
@_date: 2014-08-20 08:27:13
As long as you have the "seed" stored somewhere safe and secured, you can always recover using brainwallet or bitaddress's website :-) More and more apps are coming who will support this. In my case I purchased 2 trezors, when one gets broken or whatever, I can straight away recover to the second one.
@_date: 2014-08-29 12:46:44
Another repost...
@_date: 2014-08-10 14:08:39
Looks nice! Just like an alarm clock  :-)
@_date: 2014-09-04 12:38:32
Oh I think I know what that is! Doesn't Mark K. has one of these wallets as well?
@_date: 2014-08-14 13:07:00
You are correct, but wouldn't that be visible? The dissapearance of such an amount of coins? Well obviously not all of the 650,000 coins would be created out of thin air, but maybe a portion of it?
EDIT: to correct myself, I'm not talking about "creating" bitcoins, but I'm talking about database manipulation. So he traded in numbers shown in the database instead of actual bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-09-09 11:25:37
It's fake. The address doesn't exist + name is fake.
@_date: 2014-08-10 11:09:41
Thanks! I'm thinking of using the four buttons to switch between currencies or maybe other feeds/statistics.
@_date: 2014-08-10 11:19:33
That's cool! Problem is only that when I get visitors at home, they'd be seeing my awesome wealth in Bitcoins hehe :-) 
@_date: 2014-09-03 09:38:44
Suggestion: "From New York to Australia in half a second. Sending money has never been easier using Bitcoin." Something like that? Tweak it a bit?
@_date: 2014-08-20 07:50:06
Funny to read this... a month ago I also reported a couple of vurnerabilities regarding to 'direct server access'... The only thing I noticed was that they quickly switched from IP address (behind Cloudflare) and I never received any responce to if they fixed it or not... Although I did not do it using their support system, but sent it through Roger Ver. He forwarded it to them.
EDIT: I just found out that they did not change their original IP address, and they did infact closed the security holes that I've reported. Nobody just ever notified me or thanked me... But yeah... It's done in favour for our community.
@_date: 2014-08-14 13:14:34
Yes, that's exactly what I tried to explain. Thanks! Obviously not all of the 650,000 coins, but probably a good portion of it.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:01:39
If he doesn't want to make wallet software for an altcoin, he has every right not to. You can't dictate what someone should develop, unless you employed him.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:22:26
:') Logical007 should pick a new username.
@_date: 2017-04-09 20:51:58
I only used blockchain.info to quickly check for confirmation. The only thing I can think of is to contact the company/service, and show them the problem blockchain.info is having:
Blocktrail is showing the correct address:
@_date: 2017-04-07 08:59:43
.....Then it probably is a goose.....
@_date: 2017-04-09 20:16:37
Yes, I had the same thing. Sending to a multi-sig address resulted in a wrong address in the blockchain.info explorer.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:51:13
Like this? Is this a covert attack? 
@_date: 2017-04-02 14:24:03
Correct, I was doubting myself first, but I'm personally looking at the Block versioning, if 0x20000000 and coinbase == EB + AD then the signal is BU. If 0x20000002 then I'm dismissing the coinbase text and signal it as SegWit.
My reason for this is that I'm sure BU miners are not going to start signaling for a SF increase + BU... You can see the difference yourself:

Lets cherish this day.
@_date: 2015-10-11 18:26:52
Not that I know of. I do know that Genesis Trading is planning/busy to set up an European Bank account. Just wondering when...
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:05:43
Could you DM me the tx's you're having problems with? Only if you feel comfortable with that of course.
@_date: 2017-05-02 13:25:41
Because they're talking about Bitfinex and not Coinbase.
