Yea, I read it but sorry to say I don't buy into it.  There is a high probability Satoshi is not even American and he may not even know who Ron Paul is.  Economists have been talking about the Austrian vs. Keynesian debate well before Ron Paul.
Ron Paul did not create a group of people to accept bitcoin.  In fact, before any Ron Paul libertarians jumped on board, it was mostly technologists and nerds that bought bitcoin.  If you went to the Ron Paul festival in the video I would bet more than 95% have never, ever downloaded a bitcoin wallet.

I've been asking myself this same question.  It seems like the Intersango guys (Amir especially) was able to do this full time because they opened their own exchange, which funds their projects.  Amir was able to port the bitcoin protocol to his project "libbitcoin".  However, opening an exchange is not trivial so maybe you could ask them for a job.  Your resume with bitcoin is impressive.

Some people prefer to acquire newly mined bitcoins instead of buying them at an exchange.  It is more anonymous that way.  If it is pure anonymity you are looking for then buying hardware to obtain bitcoins is the way to go.  
Also, newly mined coins are worth slightly more.

Tranferring ownership of all or part of a company tends to end up in disaster.  I used to work for a small company that was bought out by a larger company.  The owners of the small company always said they were the startup types guys.  Once the transfer was complete then they bolted.  The small company that was acquired became a complete mess for several months.  There were several restuctures of the company and it was no easy task for the new CEO to pull everthing back together.  So my personal experience is that company restructures are very difficult.
Similarly, I feel the situation between Coinlab and MtGox is typical for company overhauls.  Peter at Coinlab is a startup type guy and you can tell by his track record.  He never planned to stay for the long haul.  Mark at Mt Gox, though, has grown his company after another a aquisition that did not go well.  However they have been hacked free for a while  so I trust my bitcoins more with him than with Peter.  After the Bitcoinica transfer of ownership mess I believe they (Tihan and Peter) decided to let Mt. Gox handle the tech side instead of coding it themselves.  Coinlab may believe that programming another exchange is redundant due to duplicate work, but I believe the real answer is that they dont want to be responsible for the trading site because they dont have the guts or the technical confidence.  If they did they would have programmed their own exchange from the ground up.  After seeing so many exchanges fail or get hacked they were too scared to do it themselves.
So here we are now with a lawsuit.  It was suspected by some that the deal would fall though.  It is unfortunate Coinlab (and Mt Gox) did not realize this until it was too late.

I have a guess.  Mt Gox got REALLY busy when the price went up to 266.  They had to deal with DDOS, hiring people, bank withdraw issues, etc.  So Mt Gox had to work overtime and put the Coinlab deal aside.  Peter of Coinlab did not take this into account and was a baby about it.  Imagine all those lost revenues Coinlab lost to Mt Gox from all the trading at the peak of 266.  I dont blame Mt Gox since the bubble was not planned into the contract.  I blame Coinlab for not renegotiating the contract to deal with the unique circumstances.

WASHINGTON—The world's largest bitcoin trading exchange appears to have taken a key step to comply with U.S. anti-money-laundering rules and potentially avoid additional run-ins with authorities.
A company listed as Mt. Gox this week registered as a money services business with the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, according to FinCen's website. Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which says it handles about 80% of all trading in the virtual currency, couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
FinCen in March started applying traditional money-laundering rules to "virtual currencies" amid growing concern that new forms of digital cash are being used for illicit activities. Those rules mandate that exchanges register with FinCen, follow stricter bookkeeping requirements and report transactions of more than $10,000.
About a month after the edict, the Department of Homeland Security seized an account tied to Mt. Gox, alleging the company and a subsidiary were conducting transactions "as part of an unlicensed money service business."
According to FinCen's website, the agency received Mt. Gox's registration on Thursday. The online form listed a street in Dover, Del., as the company's address.

Thats how lawyers write contracts so it seems like a long time.  There was a due date that was missed.
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:47:23
Perhaps.  Only reason I think not is because it has only been one month since deadline and a detailed lawsuit is out.  Probably took at least two weeks to write the lawsuit.

That's why you renegotiate a new contract so everyone wins.  Some of those profits could have been renegotiated and the original contract appended.  By suing, Coinlab just makes enemies and an lose situation for Mt Gox, possibly Coinlab, and bitcoin in general.

I can't figure out how to buy gyft cards with bitcoin on the iPhone app...help?
@_date: 2013-09-13 18:51:11
Yes, there is a feedback loop here.  You cannot buy ASICMINER with fiat, but you can with bitcoins.  Any bitcoin security that goes up in value not only increases the value of the security but also the expands the wealth generation of the bitcoin economy.

Loans are 5%-10%.  Bitcoin is 100%+.  You win but could have won more.

Coinbase appears to have poor levels of engineering talent based on Zhoutong style coding practices ("I'm the best programmer.  I coded it one week."), which is good for sites like twitter but terrible for financial sites since it is imperative sites work the first time.

The intrinsic value of cryptocurrency is privacy.  Cryptography is for privacy.

~~Ok, So I went to app.gyft.com on my iPhone.  When I get to checkout I am presented with the bitpay QR code.  How do I send bitcoins to that QR Code using my phone?  Is there an "easy" method?~~
EDIT: I did not know blockchain has a wallet that can send bitcoins on the iPhone!  Cool!
