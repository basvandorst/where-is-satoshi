Here's a thought: [icon fonts]( are a common way to shoehorn symbols that don't exist in unicode into websites. Perhaps some people could design a set of icon fonts with all the variations on the symbol for bitcoin at the codepoint for ฿. Showing off the fact that there are renderings of the bitcoin symbol that aren't acceptable Baht symbols could, as I [mentioned above]( emphasize the semantic difference between the two.

Yes! The fact that there are a number of different ways to write it is actually a good thing for bitcoin getting a unicode symbol! Unicode symbols are there as units of some semantic meaning; an "a" is an "a", in every way, but is not the same as ["а"]( The two letters look the same, but mean different things. Knowing the difference between the Cyrillic and Latin letters means you can render them differently. And knowing the difference between "THAI CURRENCY SYMBOL BAHT" and "CURRENCY SYMBOL BITCOIN" means you can render the former only in the ways acceptable to that symbol, but the latter in the superset that are acceptable for it.

The `bitcoin:` [URI scheme]( is a good one that exists right now. You can make a link like `bitcoin:NotARealAddressButYouGetThePoint?amount=1000&amp;label=sample&amp;message=whatever`, and people just have to click it (reddit's Markdown implementation doesn't support them, but that's reddit's problem). As long as your client is set up properly, it'll work. The real hurdle is making sure clients reliably set themselves up properly.

Google doesn't have any exchange operations of its own to get the price from. It has to get that data from a third party. Coinbase is a good source for that data.

I wonder if Dell supports it for their B2B sales, though. It could be only on their retail side. (It's no more arbitrary a line than the numerous companies that only accept BTC in a certain country.)

Pet peeve: git != GitHub. I don't have anything against GitHub - I actually quite like it - but thinking that it and git are one and the same keeps you from realizing the full potential of *distributed* version control. DVCS can do things that are pretty mind-blowing, if you think about it. And while the majority of use cases lead to a process based around a centralized service like GitHub or BitBucket, the underlying distributed technology enables amazing things to be done that could never have been dreamt of under the old centralized systems.
Sound like anything else you know? ;)

Or, if they play their cards right, it'll make them the leader in facilitating BTC payments, especially regarding dispute resolution (and potentially escrow), given their well-established and trusted (among most people, even if it's derided here) name in the retail market. It's entirely possible that PayPal is being a rare, rare example of a big company seeing and embracing a potential game-changer before it happens.

This is a glaring flaw in the protocol. Traditional currencies are far superior in their support for randomized boolean selection operations. I bet bitcoin doesn't even have the built-in [tire wear indication]( protocol that the US dollar does.

95% of users only using Google for the price basically assumes a world full of "casuals", who would probably be using Coinbase anyway. Besides, it's not like Coinbase would be able to move the market by manipulating the price they show (assuming they would have any other reason to do so, which I doubt). The market is moved by money, not by users. Institutional investors will always outweigh the casuals, and they will always be on an actual exchange.

My assumption would be that, if people aren't willing to pay the $30 or whatever for the transaction, that cost will go down. As he says, nobody's going to put more into it than they get out, so as reward drops I would expect the amount of money put into seeking it to drop as well. What the limit as t→∞, and whether it's an acceptable number for retail (as opposed to bank-to-bank) transactions, I don't know.

From what you and are saying, it sounds like Stripe was basically covering its ass with the banks it needs to deal with in order to conduct its business. I get the impression that Stripe's position in terms of what payments it can process is one where the credit card companies and banks basically have all the say. There's a fair amount of hate in this thread coming from that fact, which is unfortunate. I'd rather have an impotent ally than any kind of enemy, any day.
