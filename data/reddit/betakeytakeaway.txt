If you can only run if for 10h/day profitably, you will need at least a year to break even. 
No one knows how things will be in a year, so it's a bit of a gamble.

Bitcoin isn't free of third party trust either and as it grows it will be regulated as well.

That's why gold exchange-traded products exist, they were invented to solve literally all of the problems you listed.
Additionally we know gold is a good long term store of value, bitcoin is not even 10 years old and has not passed the test of time.

I like how it's always "buy bitcoin" and never "use bitcoin".
Everyone is in for speculation.

Even easier:
1) Have no clue about economy
2) Propose manipulation strategy
3) Nothing happens because you already lost you money "investing"

Can anyone explain why increased mining is expected to increase the price? 
Shouldn't more supply do the opposite?

Before that, the precious metal content in coins was reduced to make additional money.

It's actually because Venezuela can't afford to export oil any more because the price dropped and Venezuela's oil isn't very clean.

Why would they add up?
The cap is just price * total coins. The volume is the amount traded during a period.
Let's say the price is $100 and there are 10 coins = 1,000 market cap.
Now 1 coin is traded for $90. Means volume is $90 or 1 coin. And the new cap is $90 * 10 coins = $900.
Means $90 volume and $100 less market cap.
