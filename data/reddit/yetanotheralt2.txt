Also remember the efficient market hypothesis. It's not perfect, but it's close enough that most amateur traders are likely to get screwed.
Of course, that assumes you have linear utility in money, which may not be the case.

Sixty-second version of the efficient market hypothesis:
Suppose the bitcoin is likely to go up. There are a bunch of bitcoin traders that are trying to make money, so they'll likely notice this and start buying. All that buying drives the price up, and this continues until the current price is the same as what the traders think the price is going to eventually end up being.
Similarly, if the bitcoin is likely to go down, the traders will start selling, causing the price to drop.
In summary, assuming there are enough intelligent traders trying to make money at bitcoin, the current price is usually the same as the expected future price, and buying in (or cashing out) is fundamentally a gamble rather than an investment.
**tl;dr: There's no such thing as a good investment, because someone else got there first.**
The first major exception to this is if you think you can out-research the other traders/investors. If you can make a prediction about bitcoin's future *that the other people in the market haven't already also made*, then you can make money off that information.
The second major exception is if you're in an unusual situation where a simple gamble could be a good idea. For example, if you need $10,000 for a life-saving medical procedure, then you may not care very much about the difference between having $0 and having $9000, but you care enormously about the difference between $9000 and $10,000. In that case, if you have $9000 already, taking a risk to try to get the last thousand might be your best strategy.

Bitcoin is volatile. I don't recommend investing totally in it, but it can still have a place as part of a broader portfolio.
Investments are not cleanly divided into "good" and "bad". It's a complex landscape of risk, reward, correlation, and diversity.

Not necessarily, if you assume that "eventually" is constrained to occur before the heat death of the universe.

I do something similar. In my opinion, the main value of Bitcoin is as a medium of exchange, so my general policy is to keep on hand enough that it's conveniently available for purchases, and whenever I actually spend some I take that as evidence of Bitcoin's usefulness and buy a little bit more than I just spent.
