Yes, it’s the anonymous nature of it that worries governments. If it became solely a black market currency, then it’s highly likely laws would be passed that would make ownership of it illegal.

This is utter rubbish

Tired of reading stupid posts about when people get paid or the time of year, thought I’d post some likely actual reasons for the sudden crash:
* Repeated rumours of a potential ban in crypto trading by the Korean government
* Statement by the French government around controlling / banning crypto trade
* Another hack of a different currency reported this morning
All the above will create a lack of confidence for new investors - it will get worse if other governments follow suit as well - and if the hacks keep coming lay-people will not understand the difference between one currency and the next, and it will deter the general public.
When confidence drops in a market it will always fall. You have to decide for yourself if it’s temporary, or whether to HODL!

The transactions are anonymous, true, but you’d still have to keep your wealth somewhere, so it could be seized. And miners could be targeted to slow / prevent transactions. I mean cash is untraceable but that doesn’t stop them arresting people with suspiciously large amounts of it!

It was BlackWallet actually, the headlines are misleading.

Futures themselves are indicative of the large number of new people and international interest in the bitcoin. Couldn’t sell them otherwise. A lot of the news you mentioned will have been about them... they were announced from 1st December onwards, so both the sudden push that created the ATH and the subsequent oscillation could well be attributed to that.

Apparently the Chinese government is also doing a crackdown on mining operations...

It wasn’t though was it, the price rose broadly consistently for 2017 until December 16/17th. It’s only been oscillating since it dropped back from that high.

Perhaps! Who knows?! Trade volume has suddenly spiked, 150% of what it was yesterday. People are likely buying the dip. But is that a good idea? Only you can decide!
