@_date: 2017-12-31 03:43:20
you misspelled "because" on 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:26:32
Well I remember the Dot.com days and every new tech could be seen as "the future" and a lot of them were technically strong and solid, but their management and the market were the things you couldn't control.  You can control whether you agree or disagree with a certain tech.  So even thought block-chain is a wonderful tech, it still has to be tested and the market has not matured yet.  So yes, it's still a gamble.  (But then again, everything is)

@_date: 2017-12-17 20:49:07
I will say this high price makes me nervous . . it's sorta like that "everyone has to have" toy for Christmas that is driving the price up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:23:46
What do you mean?  1. The price was started at $8k+ plus when other exchanges had BCash at $3k.  2. They turned off your ability to sell your BCash for real BTC/LTC/ETH.  You know I don't even have an BCash but I'd be pissed if I did and I couldn't spend it because Coinbase wouldn't let me, thats' not letting the market correct itself so it's manipulation.  Then you have [this tweet from CNBC](
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:23:31
Is there a reason they call Roger Ver Bitcoin Jesus? . . I just saw that in several media spots and I was like . .uh . .why?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:36:34
I'm not a big fan of them . . .but they helped me get in the game so I'm cool with that.  Just transfer your coins over to a wallet or paper storage.

@_date: 2017-12-28 04:12:18
Set your price on GDAX.  I learned this the hard way as well.  When I bought on Coinbase, I was charged the highest price.  It sucked.  I had no idea, but it's a learning experience.

I think you are solid on that . . AND I think that right there is why Roger Ver wanted to keep BCH called "Bitcoin Cash".
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:22:57
Invest in things you believe in . . .do you believe in it?
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:21:36
Funny, that's how I felt about investing in Bitcoin . . "why not, if I lose my money, it will be as if I went to the casino"
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:29:29
It discourages identity theft bro.

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:10:09
You know that's a fake account right?
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:41:54
That sucks.  I don't know what to say.  I missed out on some true .dot com opportunites to have a couple of million dollars and I was very depressed because opportunities like that don't just come around all the time . . .but at that time I was lucky I met my wife and grew up poor so, I've been broke and survived so I had the confidence in knowing if I had to roam around in that bottom of bottom of the financial worth, I can make it.  Life is more valuable than any bitcoin/money etc...
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:35:04
And THAT is one of the major reasons why Roger Ver wanted to keep the "bitcoin" in Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2018-08-31 04:22:18

@_date: 2017-11-29 06:45:41
I usually go to the casino with my wife and we never win but go to have fun.  So for the last few months, I've pretty much told her "let's just pretend we went and take the money we usually spend at the casino and just invest in this bitcoin thing".   It's fun.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:12:36
I sent $20, I grew up poor (still am really) but I growing up I always missed out on the fun with my friends because I didn't have enough money - going to the roller rink, movies, concerts, etc..  so those feelings of having to hear them talk about how much fun they had and I wasn't able to participate came up when I read that comment about not even owning any and still enjoy posting with the group.  Fuck that.  It's not much, but they're a player now.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:36:40

Yes but that bump is based on spending (pump) and stock values going up because of it.  Unless people give out Bitcoin for Christmas . .who knows, maybe that's a marketing push that should be started "Don't know what to give for Christmas?  How about a Lambo (in 10 years)".  =)

Absolutely, but I understand the tech and it's wonderful.  Could you imagine explaining Amazon back when it was cheap and the internet first started.  How about explaining TCP/IP.  Explain web browsing when there wasn't a lot of content, websites or webservices?  Block-chain tech is the value behind it.  Understand what it provides.  If you are in this business for the currency gains, you are looking at the wrong place, once the infrastructure is solid, then you can look investing in companies that utilize block-chain to provide solutions.  Buffet's quote of "unless I understand the business" really means "what solution does it solve? can I understand what it provides because that's it's true value?".   This is spirit of his quote.
