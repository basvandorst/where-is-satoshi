Yeah, I had to pay $11 transaction fee yesterday - why are they so high at the minute?

Who needs a house when you can live in a bitcoin bubble :D

The transaction fee alone would cost almost 10x more than that at the minute.

You'd have to find someone to buy 100k bitcoins from you though - do most exchange websites have some sort of cap of how much you can sell/buy at once? I know the one I use does.

What causes them to be unconfirmed? Just unlucky or is it to do with the processing fee they paid?

1. There is no middleman to send bitcoin to another person's bitcoin wallet though. There are a growing number of shops that are accepting bitcoin payments now too.
2. Yes - the exchanges provide a way to buy/sell bitcoin with safety. If you have a friend who wants to sell bitcoin and you want to buy, there's nothing stopping you from doing the transaction yourselves but I guess it requires trust.
3. Not sure on that myself, sorry. Hopefully someone else can help.

If you're buying and HODLing now is always the best time I guess.

There are bitcoin exchange websites where you can buy/sell bitcoin for fiat currency.

A lot of people who use Bitcoin are libertarians/anarchists who don't believe that governments are a good idea and believe taxation is theft.

If you paid 15k for 1 bitcoin and you sell now for 7k, you haven't made a profit to buy more with?

Many bought at a higher price than it's currently at so by selling, those losses would be realised.

Because there is no guarantee it will go down further. Maybe it will be below 5k next week, maybe it will be back up to 10k, or somewhere in-between.
