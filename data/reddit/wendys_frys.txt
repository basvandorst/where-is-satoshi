I mean you could probably blow it in one day if you like to buy your drugs ahead of time.

Quickly! Everyone start spending money on cryptocurrency greenhouses to mine with so that I can afford to upgrade my PCs graphics card again.

I'm assuming Americans are just stupid. We take any opportunity to make money and run with it. I suspect the prices will drop eventually. It just sucks for me and a bunch of other gamers right now because it's technically cheaper to drop 1500 on a prebuilt pc that has a 1080 in it than it is to actually buy just the card.

Man that's crazy the whole 3000-5000 thing. I saw a bit of that but it wasn't in 09. Wild stuff man

I'm happy for all this depression I have.

But I don't want another console. I wanna play cyberpunk 2077 on a 1080 but they cost like 3000 now ):

This. Durring those seven years you probably would have already sold it. I know I would have because I was young and would have been like "I can sell for $200?!?!?!?" Never would have made it to the 20k point. 
Edit: I also had no money back then anyways because I was a teenager. Like 13 or so.

See heres the thing I dont want to mine. I want a 1080 so I can play my vidya games at a higher resolution. I dont want to pay stupid money though since they were way cheaper before.

YES. The most pain in my life is when people who want to mine bit coin tell me to "just buy a console" when I'm complaint about the price of the 1080 that I was about to buy before the price sky rocketed.

Probably not. On one card I realistically could not mine enough coin to pay for anything.
