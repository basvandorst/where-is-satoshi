where is the bottom
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:23:15
guess btc is no longer hot anymore. I sold my alts for btc when btc was marching towards 16.5k a few days ago. thought I made the right decision, but now seeing btc drops again and the alts I sold keeps going up, I start to doubt
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:43:15
paying tax on capital gain is fairly reasonable
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:24:15
please be back asap.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:53:13
15k for me...
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:38:00
here comes the wise advice
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:35:23
based on mining cost and market involement, I would say the most reasonable price for bitcoin right now would be at 6-7k
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:17:54
I would rather it go straight to the very bottom.,
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:20:03
btc will hit low 8500 and then try to break through 9000. succeed or not, it will turn downward trend again on monday for 7k.   Then a rebounce back to 8k. lastly head wards 4.5k 
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:50:13
no, I dont  cause I wanna buy more at a lower price
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:34:43
im waiiting for sub 4k. it will happen in march, and i have patience
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:32:43
dont really wanna count on weekdays, as global stock markets might countinue going downward and most likely crypto will follow.
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:10:00
comon dude, be realistic. Bitcoin will drop further to 2-3k by June of this year
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:21:18
dont be mad just because you are in a position of losing money. Crypto at this stage to me is no difference from a casino
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:02:46
yeah, I totally agreed. Those who invested early days keep shilling the idea of hodling is what cost people to lose their money.
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:55:04
I dont see it going as low as 8k. I am thinking 8.6-8.7k, and then bounce back to 9.4-9.5k. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:35:12
quite the opposite, we should all start FUD, and let the shit hit the buttom faster
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:03:04
got eaten
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:01:48
yeah , keep dreaming
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:54:14
huge sell wall on bifibex above 7700.  expext a price drop guys 
@_date: 2018-04-01 06:35:54
they always do the trick. When this shit starting to drop again, they will withdraw all the buy orders
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:01:12
u guys dont like flatline, here comes the drop
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:08:03
I think most agree that 5k is the buttom, thats why it wont be the buttom. It moght go further down that
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:47:22
why keep fooling urslef.
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:56:40
