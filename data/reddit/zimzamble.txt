Respectful debate, "shut your mouth". kinda tossed that out the window yourself. You're arguments are really devolving, when did I ever bring up what a convertible bond is

lets say I wanted to move 1k USD between my bank accounts but a decimal gets messed up and I'm now the first trillionaire. Or how about we don't say that because every group that moves money is founded on the basis that they can successfully move money. Bitcoin wouldn't have the following it does if there was a chance a mistake like that can happen. Like everything it was tested to make sure it works. Its intrinsic value like all currency is solely in the people who use it, if everyone stopped using the US dollar it would have no value.

So are you just always this angry when commenting online? And remember we are online its not like you can really test how much i know when I'm typing this on a laptop, a device i can use to access basically all the info in the world. You come off like you desperately want people to think you're smarter than them

There are many online/physical outlets that take bitcoin as a payment method, is that not considered "something real" to you?

Not gonna shut my mouth just gonna give you this advice, I'ts the internet no one believes your back story. Just give your opinion in a non arrogant braggadocious way and people will be more likely to have a nice debate with you on the topic
