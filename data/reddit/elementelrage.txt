It was sent by e-mail. If you had purchased shares on havelock investments, well mine came in.

Did you purchase shares on havelock investments?

I think it would be good for them to give something, even just a small amount. Especially considering the rocky road their shares were on. You're right, it takes money to build a network but restoring investor confidence would be good too.

Agreed, about time. Now if we could only get the dividends they were hinting at.

Ok so I'm still figuring all this out, if you put in a larger transaction free,  then you are more likely to get yet transaction processed?

I used  with good results. Their e transfer service is good. And they are Quite friendly. Based out of Vancouver

I just felt like it might have had somewhere to go. 5 at this value is a bit of cash to loose.

Can't find the 5yr tab...

I figure it is the best place to sell or offer services for bitcoin. It is not like there is a ebay for bitcoin.

This sounds like a religion of sorts 
@_date: 2013-04-02 06:20:54
Bought with as much as I was willing to buy. I'm kind of like eff it. Not worth it to re-buy in
