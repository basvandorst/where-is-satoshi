Looks like the communicated very well, notifying users the system would  be down, and provided multiple updates when things went sideways.  I think they did very well, shit happens.

My local branch of us bank said btc was against the banks policy and it was documented on their website.  I could not find it anywhere so I called corporite and they searched and also could not find any referance and were not aware of any such policy.  For now they don't care.  I could see how coinbase transactions could be flagged as fraud as there are a lot of people fraudulently hijackibg account info and buying coins, the bank will not have any way of recovering such a purchase.  It could be BOA flags the purchase but could be cleared up with a phone call.

Same question, my Ledger Nano box was plastic wrapped and did not have a security tamper proof sticker there was a card inside that explained why it did not have a sticker stating the device can not be tampered with. Seller was "SQ Deals Store" 100% positive feedback in the last 12 months.

Not commenting on the integrity of the device or arguing against 3rd party.  I do want to comment on the Amazon process, the seller can have stock in their hands and then ship it to Amazon fulfillment or they have have it directly shipped to Amazon from the distributor.

I think it's realistically too late for new comers to make a million dollars, with the price being $7k per coin and assuming it will hit $100k you would need to invest $98k now to get 14 coins.

I did, never heard of it.

who was the seller, do they have a list of authorized sellers, and were they concerned that it could be tampered with?

No just part for now still learning, it seems to be gaining ground in the mainstream and it's easier to buy and safer store, I think it's sticking around a while unless governments start banning it.

As a noob GDAX was pretty easy, worth the extra 30 min to figure it out.

Question regarding the paper wallet, where is the amount assigned to the wallet stored as it's obviously not physically transferred to the paper.  What is the risk of the storage association being lost?
