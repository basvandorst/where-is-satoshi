Unfortunately, Bitcoin support is only available for developers that use itch.io's [payout system]( for now. Still, that covers the majority of titles sold over the past 10 days, but as all itch things, it's the developer's choice.
That said, I'm noting down that a "Only show me games I can buy/support with Bitcoin" browse filter would be useful!

Looking for something reminiscent of the DOS era, [The Chaos Engine]( comes to mind - it's a remake of the original [1993 title](
In a completely different style, the 1-bit [Royals]( by the creator of Threes (2048's inspiration) is very good (and pay what you want) - I've spent more hours than I'd like to admit figuring out the rules and all the possible way to achieve royalty.
Not retro at all, but you asked for something addictive, Alan Hazelden's [A Good Snowman is Hard to Build]( gave me a newfound appreciation for puzzle games.
In the FPS genre, perhaps a bit later than what you're asking for, I discovered [Strafe: Speed Zone]( today. Haven't had a chance to play it yet, but the trailer seduced me! Looking forward to confirm that intuition later today.
For the addictive part of your post, I've had the chance to play [Splasher]( (Early Access still) and it very much looks like the kind of game I'd enjoy speedrunning. But at least in the beginning, it pays to take it slow!
The top sellers list is public &amp; available here: [
I'm aware part of your post stems from the fact that discovery isn't entirely ideal yet on itch.io - we're always looking for ways to improve that, if anyone has any ideas, now's a good time to come forward!

Hi Full disclaimer: I work with itch.io. Happy to answer any questions here.
After a quick review of the subreddit rules, I believe it's okay for me to post this bit of news? Should be my only itch.io-related submission to this subreddit. If I messed up, let me know!

Speaking of, do you know who could help get itch.io listed on the Bitcoin FAQ? maybe?

Re time: The actual integration was pretty quick. Stripe has made it very easy to integrate Bitcoin, they provide a seamless abstraction over Coinbase, which handles the really hard part (guaranteed BTC/USD exchange rate, temporary receivers).
We did spend an extra amount of time reviewing the code &amp; testing it, as with every change that touches payments. It's always scary to deploy those.
Re first: That's a very good question! It would be very cool if we actually were the first, but I doubt it. Stripe's bitcoin integration has been out [for a few months now]( but I haven't heard of any other website that makes use of it.
From what I can see, Humble for example uses Coinbase directly, and, as far as I can tell, they only allow Bitcoin purchases for their bundles, not for store purchases.
I'm not 100% happy yet with our Bitcoin integration - ideally, there would be an option for sellers to keep BTC if they don't want an immediate USD conversion. The easiest way would be for them to associate a Coinbase account, but that kinds of ruin the idea of a decentralized currency, doesn't it?
I'm looking forward to extend itch.io's Bitcoin integration to support that use case, but it might be some time because that becomes available.
edit: I accidentally the wrong URL

Nope! However, Stripe takes a smaller cut out of Bitcoin transactions, it goes:
  * 2.9% + $0.30 for credit card transactions
  * 0.5% for bitcoin transactions
Let's take an example $10 transaction.
  * CC: $9.41 after Stripe, divided between dev &amp; itch.io
  * Bitcoin: $9.95 after Stripe, divided between dev &amp; itch.io
Note that devs can [choose how much they give to itch.io]( - they can even keep all of it!
We could add a feature to let devs "pass on" the lower fees to the buyers, that would be interesting :) Feel free to [open an issue]( on our GitHub project if you're interested in following that.
