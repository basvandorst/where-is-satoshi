Please go the extra mile and teach them how to withdraw to their own custody - i'm pretty sure that the "forfeitures" are coming to the exchanges soon as govts start getting really scared which they have already
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:08:04
Purchase wherever you want but withdraw to your own wallet.. check the list of wallets on bitcoin.org

I have a strange feeling, looking at the voting pattern here that either (i) coinbase has deployed sock puppets on this sub or (ii) there's a lot of newcomers here who are simply "investors" waiting to get burnt by an exchange.
You look like you've been around for some time so im replying here.. i really couldn't care less but be careful and take care of the newbies if that's the case.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:46:17
Im not worried for btc but yes you can expect a few titanics to sink in the meanwhile trying to "play" btc
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:24:01
I guess so, i'll let someone else confirm around here (as you can see im not exactly into coinbase lol )

Sovereignty comes with self responsibility - i sincerely cudnt give a shit about ppl wanting to buy a "hot new stock" - theyre anyway the weak hands who'll get burnt at the next 40% dip
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:10:18
Im not calling you a sock puppet unless you want to defend them in this segwit business .. and for god's sake btc isnt comcast if this ship sinks coinbase isnt going to save you so you have an incentive to try and make them buck up - it's good for both you and coinbase

@_date: 2017-12-06 00:16:38
Dont think of coinbase as just a service you use, you need to signal your preferences to them for the overall collective steering of the btc network.
Otherwise they think you don't exist and advocate things like Segwit2x which could have blown up all your btc.
Is that comprehensible ?

I was thinking more of a lump sum one time payment at a price competitively determined by miners posting offers to convert
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:23:51
U dont need 100% of the miners onboard though right? In that case the payments shud go down as the last ones come onboard
@_date: 2017-03-02 11:52:20

Is this happening after a long time ?
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:49:08
If you are new here, for now just make sure you hold your own private keys and don't leave your coins on an exchange.
Segwit is basically a backwards compatible upgrade of the protocol which will be in effect in a few days. It generated a lot of controversy for the past 2 years and got activated on the network after some very pitched battles involving real bitcoin money and the future of bitcoin itself (look up UASF, Bip 91 and August the 1st)
Cheers and may the force be with you

Just keep your coins in your own wallet - look up the comparisons on bitcoin.org.

What makes you think participants here will be particularly honest ? Bitcoin is supposed to be a trustless system right ?
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:31:46
1. If they tell their clients and suppliers to shift for example - i cud be using a node for a number of diff reasons, not just for bitpay, but bitpay could still have leverage on me.
2. I don't know, personally I'm opposed to any hard fork which calls itself bitcoin - we've already crossed that bridge and theres ppl in venezuela etc whose lives depends on staying in sync with the present consensus.

Is there even such a thing as a S2X supporting node worthy of its name ?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:04:41
Let's contact our bitcoin accepting services and ask them what their position is on Bitpay's 2x.
Protonmail for example.
If they want to use Bitpay / 2x, no more bitcoin for them - they can have my fiatcoin instead.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:52:24
Relax man... let these idiots pump and dump their bch before returning to the table to finance the 2x fud.
Bitcoin as it is today is not going anywhere. Run a full node, use the right wallets etc, and watch these altcoins enter your portfolio giving you spare change to spend on your vacations. 
The entire idea of bitcoin is nullified by these altcoins, so nobody with actual money to protect from the banking cartel is going to bother with bch and bitpay / silbert coin and so on.
Peace out and think of the name for your next yatch this we.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:01:17
Yes they will have to give an update.
It's more complicated than ceasing to use Bitpay services. The network has to avoid as many "forks" as possible to it often turns into a game of chicken like it happened with Segwit.
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:50:14
Go away Roger, just go away- ive had to stop going to ur timbuktu sub with all the downvoting by astroturfers and the 10 minute delays to repost.

@_date: 2017-08-19 03:13:25
Yes you mean it's the same anti-segwit fud that meant less than 30% of the miners were signalling segwit.. Until UASF stepped in.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:45:35
That is correct - but to make an agreement on consensus change actually executable in bitcoin land requires more than a handful of signatures - it requires a broad consensus.
Bitpay can very well advance on their promises but it's of no use trying to force others who didnt sign to follow their path.
If it could be done that way then we already have the fiat system.

No this is a few businesses thinking BTC is their bitch v. everyone else
The miners are only incidentally involved because they happen to be rich and have funded a few of these companies - but the real prob is these companies wanting to create a second Paypal at the cost of everything else that btc is abt.
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:25:16
Thank you. I think its time to put out a draft "black list" and finalise it with names of companies still supporting S2X wo replay protection on the day of the HF.

For all the newbies here: not your private keys, not your bitcoins ! You've been warned
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:15:06
Dont worry abt the normal chain surviving.
It is important to not forget after its over, and ensure the timely demise of these S2X companies by starving them of business.
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:10:07
You figure that out if you're a US citizen. The alternatives are :
1. Btc becomes cartelized by these players and it's all fucked or
2. These players win and are then taken down because of their centralization - in that case btc survives long term but your sheep are fucked.
I'm good i dont care in absolute terms but would be a shame to see this die.
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:20:43
Dont be so sure, none of them have actually committed much financially and theyve all hedged their bets - we have to take the initiative of taking them down

You know, normally i would have told you it's ok and it's not dangerous.
But I'm not going to guarantee anything as regards an S2X supporting NYA signatory. In fact I'd be happy to see it go down.
Good luck and be careful.

I thought it was hardware ?
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:00:45
2 possibilities that i could think of :
1. Asicboost (hardware) could itself be thought of as contaminated by the gpl (not really sure that's possible) 
2. All the software / firmware required for interfacing the hardware with btc programs is treated as a dependancy - which means that it must be released under the gpl
Maybe a specialist could go into the details its worth looking at how the privatisation aspect could be limited if not taken down

In general, dont deposit your btc at coinbase or any other third party but hold it yourself, preferably in a hard and cold wallet for large sums.
As for the rest yes depending on what kind of money you're talking abt do some research.. Btc and crypto is about being sovereign and thus fully self responsible haha
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:32:52
Yeah sorry i meant shift ur legacy btc to another address before transacting with 2x coin.
As for the rest im willing to take the risk how does it matter to you anyway ull be giving me legacy btc in exchange for my 2x
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:10:53
At the moment just take your coins off coinbase and keep them in a wallet which gives you control of your keys (see the list on bitcoin.org)
After the HF, come back here and check what to do before moving the btc which you are holding.
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:07:37
Coinbase will not be running regular btc anymore, so the only thing they can give you is 2x (unless they dont plan to stick to the NYA)
A simple way to verify this would be to run a core (non 2x) node and try to recieve a withdrawal on that node after the HF. Such a withdrawal would only go through if the btc attributed to you by coinbase was from adresses existing before the HF, as adresses and balances on 2x post the HF wont be recognised by the btc chain.
Obviously that would involve losing money so i dont suggest you try.
As my own technical / bibliographical competence is limited, I suggest you mail Coinbase and ask them, or keep a track on this sub where somebody might give you better explanations.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:57:34
Maybe they realised bitcoin did't need paypal and was going to destroy it in due course

Hi man im sure uve done a great job all these years and im just a newbie - thanks for convincing the miners on segwit, but don't assume you had me or anybody else on board for the nya 2x part - you can now explain to them why nodes are running 0.15 and have no intention of shifting (probably because they didnt agree to anything in the first place) good luck

@_date: 2017-09-18 19:53:56
Agree.. But uasf was cleverer than 2x given the chances of a block reordering under a soft fork. Under 2x that's basically impossible - in fact without replay protection its the 2x chain that remains at risk not the legacy chain AFAIU.

Yes. There's people in this space expecting Coinbase to be sued to hell over this but if they had some decency, they would come out with a statement before the HF.
Doesnt mean that the statement would be honest though, Bitpay proved that recently with theirs.

@_date: 2017-09-22 20:15:31
Yes move them atleast to a phone wallet and if you have a large amount consider a hardware wallet. Look up the list of wallets on bitcoin.org, i'd suggest greenaddress because they have segwit.
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:00:26
Who told you that ? Of course im not with any NYA company but you cant choose your miner !
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:39:08
We dont know, what we do know though is that 90% of the developers or more oppose it and will do anything to keep normal btc going.
Value being attributed to demand and supply, the results should be clear after the fork (take the bcash case)

@_date: 2017-10-26 18:40:00
He's not denied it yet
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:07:32
I thought of that.. they will normally be able to get out easier than the heavy guys and manufacturers. We're still talking several versions advance notice
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:54:08
Should be fine, but they may not allo you to split and sell your 2x coins
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:34:28
Bitfury deserves the same treatment if it participates in the 2x attack but anyway a fresh PoW gives a fresh start to chip makers and restores user control over miners.
Think of it like a referendum to take out the old congress and instore a new one - with the good and the bad that comes with it
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:40:27
Fully for 2x, but please drop that expression "wrong side of history" it has been corrupted by politicians and means little.
Edit : Fully AGAINST 2x i meant !
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:27:38
Correct me if im wrong this is how to do it:
1. Transfer your btc to a new address.
2. Sell your 2x coins.
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:00:59
Im saying regardless of S2x 
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:02:33
No point in waiting again for them to fall in line - this time its the users who must attack 
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:57:53
Just tell them to buy some first and hold their own private keys. Once they get their skin in the game they should figure out the rest.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:40:32
Thats supposing that miners won't return in a few hours / days and ignoring the redundant miners being reactivated
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:01:09
Flag day, wait for broad consensus.

Why do you believe in what reddit expects nothing is happening don't worry just carry on with your life
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:23:06
Nice ! Whats Roger's reddit username maybe he can take my shitcoins too !

Thankyou for your sagacity Charlie, let's hope CB shows the same ! :D

I though bcash was a pejorative term for those idiots ?

Send them a letter by registered post with proof of receipt - no jokes its what precedes lawyers so they normally respond.
@_date: 2017-10-07 17:04:09
Correct, CB came to its senses finally
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:30:33
Guys, stop using these 3rd party wallets like blockchain and bitstamp you'll live to regret it !
Edit: typo
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:14:02
If you're storing on a core wallet thats good enough for now

Yes after splitting them idk how but its def possible

@_date: 2017-09-23 16:40:28
Let me tell you what i think about how u can secure it yourself (if u identify yourself as a newbie and wish to listen) Not the same thing as what you're saying
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:22:51
Europe is fantastic, the EU is just another politbureau
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:08:43
This my friend is the best narration of the sucker syndrome ive ever heard ! You should make an independant post titled why the general public always get shorted or something and just this extract
"Maybe they did intend to buy bitcoin. But they didn't. They probably thought "hey, I should create a coinbase account. But $2000? Way too expensive, I'll wait until it goes down to $800 and then pull the trigger". You all know how it goes.
6/2011: $30? way too expensive.
3/2012: $4? Bitcoin is dying, not catching that knife.
4/2013: $200? way too expensive.
8/2013: $100? Bitcoin is dying, not catching that knife.
12/2013: $1000? way too expensive.
8/2015: $200? Bitcoin is dying, not catching that knife.
5/2017: $2000? way too expensive.
Rinse and repeat. The vast majority of these people will just miss the boat over and over and over."
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:46:02
Yes thats for sure :)
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:02:16
Yes attack
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:42:09
Point taken. Does rinse and repeat work though ie
1. Move your btc (2x also moves to corresponding adress on 2x chain)
2. Sell your 2x (tx references to a diff block on 2x chain which is not recognized by btc) 
Yeah maybe not (idk what data the tx includes)
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:25:44
Coinbase is nobody if u have your set 1 btc and i have mine. And to hell with set 2 i dont care abt replay protection either because i have nothing to do with set 2
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:51:14
Ive always respected ur judgments here but I don't see how you can call this speculative if CB has signed onto the NYA which does not propose another coin but an upgrade of bitcoin itself to 2x.
The burden is on CB and not on me in this matter.
Edit: call it "presumptive" if u want but bot speculative
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:44:50
Think abt it this way - you tried to help and you got kicked out so now you can profit off those suckers before they turn around and buy bitcoin at 10k or whatever
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:53:25
Withdraw to a wallet where you hold the keys, see the list on bitcoin.org
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:45:23
One of the exchanges might be allowing "no fee" transactions to users on the same exchange if they dont actually put it onchain but just record in their db - in such a case keep a small amount on the exchange for daily txs and do it from there.
For wallets check out the list on bitcoin.org - airbits or bread should be good.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:54:00
Ooops see edit ! :D
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:42:34
Probably, probably not - you don't want to wait to find out. Move your btc to a private key you hold once you've bought it.
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:54:21
Normally yes
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:28:35
Coming from tyler that's simply not up to the mark - nothing wrong overall but a general lack of analytical rigour
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:53:13
Oops typo ! :D
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:58:12
A serious user activated movement to fire the miners not a bgold premine
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:13:18
Yes but cud go down further.. we've moved a lot past few months so id either buy a massive dip or wait for the water to settle a bit before buying again
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:18:05
U could wait for your ledger but in general stop keeping your btc with third parties and hold it yourself (see the list of wallets on bitcoin.org)
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:12:00
Point taken :) let's make a massive UASF edition if enough on board !
@_date: 2017-05-14 23:31:20
Sincerely doubted that word, was planning to use "template" if that helps

Read para 2
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:51:53
U/coblee i think making the agreement conditional upon fork at exact block number gives Roger a free pass. I'll be surprised if the fork happens at that block now. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:46:12
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:30:21
We'll let the money do the talking in due course
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:10:27
How does this sound as a plan of action from here to August 1 :
1. Contacting your service providers ( wallets, exchanges, etc) and telling them to take a clear stand so that you can decide to change if necessary
2. Starting up your old miners to mine some Segwit blocks (i guess we'll have all the time in the world to mine valid blocks and make some btc as Jihad Who's crap keeps getting rejected by the UASF chain, correct me if wrong)
@_date: 2017-05-15 16:06:21
The crux of my proposal was that we need to make all parties put their money where their mouth is and commit funds to some sort of trust account everytime they really have something to say.
That trust account needs to be managed such that nobody can release those funds until parties reach agreement and such an agreement is not detrimental to other stakeholders (esp users) 
Will formulate something more concrete soon.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:27:51
Contact your providers, ask them what they've planned and indicate that you'll have to shift to a BIP 148 compatible service.
I'm talking wallets, exchanges, your coffee shop, whatever.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:01:54
Can anybody out here explain to me if there will be 2 different difficulties after the intial chain split ? Or will the UASF chain have the same difficulty as the legacy chain ?
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:06:18
Because UASF
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:52:33
Haha ! :D
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:52:20
On r/btc an alt-fact is simply a fact :)

Wait but dont take my word for it (see nifty fifty )
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:26:18
U have to put atleast a 10% discount given that ur taking btc
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:47:32
U set up miners and all that for 5 bucks ? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:14:40
Stop it guys this is slander (im no fan of ver)

14 days is a very long time and according to the NYA schedule i guess we're slightly ahead of time
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:39:44
Id strongly recommend not using the blockchain.info wallet, see the list of wallets and their pros and cons on bitcoin.org.
@_date: 2017-07-21 23:16:15
Check if your popcorn supplier delivers on the moon.
LN wallets could be ready by September but no major activity till late 2017 at best - we've got a few comedies that you could tune into meanwhile (ABC, 2x) and maybe a pantomime featuring a guy from China, a guy from Japan and another white guy who claims to have a japanese name like Nakamoto or something.
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:33:45
Try getting / sending a single satoshi from / to anybody running a Core node after the miners mine their Jihan coins after changing consensus rules.
While you're at it, also try running a BCC / 2x node without any serious problem for one straight week.
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:02:22
I concur but what the hell as they say in St. Tropez you're an adult and you've been vaccinated so do as you please
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:35:36
Grow up, be a big boy and stop using Coinbase for storing your bitcoin.
You only buy there and immediately withdraw it to your own wallet (look up the list of wallets on bitcoin.org)
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:42:52
If we have a UASF style holdout even 100% miner support won't make a difference - the miners could get a taste of their own medicine if a considerable % of the economic nodes refuse 2x. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:10:06
You mean Mt. Gox ?
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:39:33
Unless you're dying of hunger, no. Just keep them in a safe wallet and remember them on a rainy day
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:13:37
Nobody could ever prevent a divorce but the question is about economic incentives - a divided btc is bad for everyone which is why the potential UASF chainsplit was a catalyst for the NYA and Segwit activation.
 Imho, we're looking at another game of chicken over 2x in November and I'm not sure 2x will win.
Edit : don't forget the status quo is against 2x this time which means that if users do nothing and keep running core 2x is out.
@_date: 2017-07-21 23:23:20
"could be" 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:43:02
Dude you're preaching to the choir here, say that on r/btc and hope atleast a few newbies are rescued from the scam that is bcc

Never buy more than you can afford to loose.. if that's what you've done and you dont need the money just keep the keys safe and forget abt it your children will thank you in due course
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:51:01
Does anyone know if the Segwit2x code is out ?
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:45:52
Or for 2x to back out to avoid the split.. let's see we'll cross the bridge when we get there.
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:48:53
I pointed that out on r/btc and got downvoted to hell
 
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:49:56
Ur idea requires ppl to have an incentive to pay in btc and not fiat so yes good luck !
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:25:06
Edit: this white paper is really the starting point in blockchain and then theres a few notions of economics which could help too : 
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:03:23
Good news ! As I understand it, you need to turn off those miners a few days before to try and keep difficulty low on August 1
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:53:21
Start with the bitcoin whitepaper
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:26:57
I remember seeing the scaling debate at Consensus 2017 and saying to myself : these Bitpay guys think of Bitcoin development as "deliverables" for their company and theyre going to find out that Bitcoin doesnt give a shit about them
This is what happens when you have a business plan with your corporate lenders breathing down your neck - could work in the "normal" world but not with a bunch of people who've come into the space to avoid that crap in the first place
@_date: 2017-07-23 07:35:04
Both Roger and Jihan have signed it unless you meant that even after signing they don't see eye to eye :

Do read the whitepaper too

I'll trade it is that good enough for you ?
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:41:25
Nooo i thought theyd fork off and let us be this time around ! :D

How would a temp decrease help anyway. Might as well make it permanent. And how do we decide when a temp decrease is req.. it’s when luke runs out of disk space ? 
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:36:27
To be clear: I’m open to a decrease in block size subject to a longer debate.
But it cannot be TEMPORARY. Because you cannot later raise the size without a Hard Fork - unless the raise is already coded in with your reduction code. 
Please correct me if I’m wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-23 02:45:09
Im pretty sure the chinese being a great nation know how to tell what's better and see the difference between btc and altcoins.
Having said that maybe they will be forced to stick to bitcoin cash in the future as segwit paves the way for truly anonymous transactions and the communists start pissing in their pants over it.
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:40:56
Wasn't it 10k ?
@_date: 2017-06-30 23:55:03
Yes, we need to ensure its no longer just uacomment.
Also, shift other wallets to UASF compatible services and get your coins ON the exchanges (increases the risk of no action for exchanges)
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:45:58
Lol i didn't know he actually thinks Wright is Satoshi but he was wiggling out of a 1:1 offer saying the price is 1:5 so i doubled down
@_date: 2017-06-30 23:57:17
Also, is there a way to forward transactions first to UASF miners ?
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:39:51
Wrong sub i guess go back to your daddy 
@_date: 2017-06-05 10:22:20
A chain split will automatically create a UASF coin, whether or not its traded on the exchanges.
The rest ill leave to you to figure, this is my vision but you could have yours too
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:43:01
Dude you need to do some reading on the internets before asking these qs but i'll answer this one for you - bip 148 is about rejecting any block that doesnt signal bip 141. Thats exactly the effect of activating bip 91. 
Now that bip 91 is activated, bip 148 is largely irrelevant except in a few scenarios which are not important for now.
Bip 141 signalling at 95% over approx 14 days leads to segwit activation.
So everything is fine at the moment. Cheers.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:57:01
God and the honey badger move in mysterious ways their wonders to perform haha
More seriously theres multiple possibilities to get there but it looks like the only way out for them esp. after theyve bit the UASF bait and found themselves on everyone's receiving end after their latest announcement.

Yeah whatever as long as theyre listed
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:12:22
Was a tick box UASF option possible or was it too complicated ?
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:37:44
Relax guys and don't feed these trolls
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:33:57
Yes of course, except the coins you receive on the legacy chain after August 1
Edit: Provided you hold your private keys
