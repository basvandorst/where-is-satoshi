They don't really do bulk orders, but I suppose you could try downloading &amp; printing the lower resolution versions that i have on my site here: 
Post your results :)
@_date: 2018-09-22 18:07:29
they're all on my store on redbubble dot com. search for bitcoin propaganda posters and you're good to go! 
@_date: 2018-09-22 16:07:02
If you search bitcoin propaganda posters on redbubble dot com you can find all of them in my store (auto-mod won't allow direct link :)  
@_date: 2018-09-22 22:39:00
Yes indeedy! Some folks in Brighton have been putting them up for a while now.
@_date: 2018-09-22 20:03:34
Haha. I created them. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:36:05
Yeah, I have the whole set on redbubble dot com if you search there for bitcoin propaganda posters. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:47:08
Right on! Glad you like them. Cheers!
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:35:18
Thanks, dude :D
@_date: 2014-06-01 02:56:22
Cool, thanks!

[Obi-wan Satoshi?](
@_date: 2014-12-13 16:43:15
One of my faves too :)
@_date: 2014-05-31 06:57:38
srsly on it.
@_date: 2014-06-07 06:35:30
@_date: 2014-12-16 22:52:37
i believe that's why they call it a tip, not a wage.
@_date: 2014-05-14 05:45:58
frickin' eh
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:06:34
@_date: 2014-05-31 00:40:32
Yeah, it's not a slam dunk, but I actually found it tricky to find high profile 'old' guys that fit the bill. Mark Williams is only 51, which I thought might not go over well either...
@_date: 2014-12-13 06:53:17
me also have that think thing.
@_date: 2014-06-07 08:37:52
lol. nice mash.
@_date: 2014-05-31 02:32:23
he's the guy in the middle :)
@_date: 2014-04-15 23:17:18
that is frickin' awesome.
@_date: 2014-04-15 21:43:04
yeah, i'm cool with it.  hence the watermark.  i'm just getting intro'd to reddit.  in fact, this is my first post!  amazed to see the 10k views via imagur. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 06:17:09
so many people need someone else to tell them what is ok, and what isn't. bitcoin is a rug being pulled slowly out from underneath the host of the party.
@_date: 2014-12-13 23:26:51
Sure, why not :)
@_date: 2014-12-13 23:23:41
Yo!  Thanks, eh!
@_date: 2014-05-14 05:47:07
i see where you're coming from, but i respect their rolling of the snowball...
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:02:12
Indeed! Being paid directly over the internet from strangers is a very powerful feeling. Wakes you up to the serious possibilities of bitcoin. This one took about 30min, i think.
@_date: 2014-12-13 16:39:05
Thanks muchly!
@_date: 2014-12-13 23:56:03
Hey thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:46:23
it's true :)

@_date: 2014-05-14 01:10:36
cool! my first btc tip.  thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-13 20:04:30
Here ya go:
@_date: 2014-05-31 06:21:49
it may come across as a blanket statement, but i think there's room to push the establishment.
@_date: 2014-05-31 06:42:45
i.e. sub in "ideas" for "men". satire isn't always clean.
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:14:53
of course, Krugman, damnit. okay hang on a sec...
@_date: 2014-05-31 02:30:31
i'd need a replacement. any suggestions?
@_date: 2014-05-29 05:26:38
@_date: 2014-05-31 04:07:19
i think we in business now. also now realize joe manchin might also work...anyway.  my first open source satire :)
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:09:47


I'm using that in my next one. Cheers.
@_date: 2014-06-07 07:50:11
i don't see the pun as so much 'crushing' as 'mindful'. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 16:40:04
Haha, right on. Merci.
@_date: 2014-12-13 05:58:14
Haha! Frickin' eh. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-05-14 02:48:50
Right on. Thanks! Bitcoin compels me!
@_date: 2014-05-31 05:42:56
ha ha. on it.
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:56:57
[he's great.  had to make this.](

@_date: 2017-08-15 07:00:28
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:35:21
cool. thanks!
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:00:08
unfortunately 3100×1620 is the largest i could find.
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:38:56
used a clone tool to remove the old pattern on the shields and then superimposed a semi-transparent B symbol on each, with an added bevel effect for depth, and warped each one to make them match the curvature.
tl;dr Photoshop :) 
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:10:32
@_date: 2016-02-13 15:39:15
my development team expressed similar concerns.
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:32:51
thanks :)
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:50:05
yeah, i made this one. the images are scans, but the text is from scratch, which gets you a bit better scaling. mods won't let me post a link to redbubbledotcom, but you can find a larger 24x32 reproduction there if you want. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:11:44
right on! cheers.
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:40:00
You are correct. I made this on a larf one night. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 22:42:27
i saw that scene as him having tears of joy.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:04:05
Almost forgot! Frame pacing goes better with music :D 
@_date: 2015-04-26 18:26:10
@_date: 2015-04-26 18:29:33
cool! cheers.
@_date: 2015-04-26 20:21:41
@_date: 2015-04-27 00:00:35
My pleasure! Keep up the great work :)
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:01:05
Thanks! Yeah, I'm afraid this is the only version. I was trying to do a sequel to my other one: 
@_date: 2019-09-06 14:44:31
Pretty comprehensive collection at 
@_date: 2015-04-26 22:57:06
cool.  thanks!
@_date: 2015-04-26 19:14:40
glad to hear. thanks!
@_date: 2015-04-27 23:02:11
cool. many thanks :)
@_date: 2015-11-21 08:08:50
me too :)   
@_date: 2016-05-12 02:54:46
@_date: 2015-03-21 00:18:44
they should have partnered with Windex to emphasize full transparency of the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-03-07 01:52:08
yeah, here's the (1986!) clip it's based on, fwiw:

Here you go: 
@_date: 2017-06-16 05:07:58
Not enough people pay close attention to the last 4 minutes of Jurassic World and how it relates to bitcoin decentralization efforts, IMHO :)
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:48:39
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:48:52
