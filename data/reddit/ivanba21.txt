Fund your account with coinbase pro with a months total so $600 usd. Then put order in daily. No fees. Then 5 days before end of each month fund it for the next month.

And it's an Emphatic Yes Blockchain is one of the worse companies/wallets for bitcoin you could use. What a shitty company. Still no SegWit support because they like to push scam coins.

Cash app most convenient way of buying Btc right now. Made it so easy for people I know that aren't tech savy to buy Bitcoin. Much easier account set up.

Kraken is good exchange and cash app is an easy way to buy Bitcoin but you pay premium for that convenience. If I were you I'd stop putting it to the side. Do daily cost averaging. Buy small amount of bitcoin everyday say $25-50 starting tomorrow. If we ever get a big dip say 30-40% correction do bigger buys and take advantage to add size to your position. Bitcoin halvening is summer of 2020 market is more sophisticated now so I'm guessing people will be front running that earlier this time around. Who knows what it'll do we have had a crazy run without a breather eventually we get a big dip but what's the top of current run who knows could be 15k, 20k,25k? Why cost averaging in isn't a bad idea at the moment. Best of luck.

Testing out lightning labs beta on iOS here's an invoice for $1 thanks. I'll pass it along to my friends test driving

Don't be a chaser but if you do chase never go all in on a chase. Buy small and add to your position on dips.

Downside is you don't actually own the coins. Cash app is holding the coins for you. Risk is if they get hacked you lose your money. I would say this is a lower risk then you holding your coins if your new. Another risk is if government cracks down, they might force cash app to sell all coins it's holding for people. I recommend learning and toying around with holding very small amount bitcoin with proper wallets. So you get comfortable owning your own keys. Don't rush that. Learn learn learn. Then move all your coins eventually out of cash app.

OpenNode.co makes it easy to accept bitcoin and lightning. I use them. Very simple for a noob like myself.

Helped me recover some funds before they are legit. Def worth a try if you remember anything from that time that could be guessed.

Spending bitcoin is dumb. Credit card works fine. Why spend something that can go up in value 1000%. Bitcoin has plenty of time to build out layer 2 3 etc to help it scale by the time it's stable enough to be a good form of currency for commerce. For right now it's programmable digital gold that can't be confiscated or censored. A lot of value in that. Gold is like a 8 trillion dollar market.

If your on android Samourai wallet is the way to go. If your on iPhone Blockstream Green Wallet is the way to go. If your holding a lot of bitcoin I don't recommend mobile wallets I recommend a Trezor or Ledgar hardware wallet. Or a Nodl if you want to experiment with Lightening network as well.

You learned your lesson. Now be prepared to buy the dip!
@_date: 2019-06-11 23:47:51
I bought a ledger and they did the same thing to be saying I picked to low of a fee. Confirmed within an hour. Bitpay go fuck yourself.

Green Wallet and Hodl wallet are the best two iOS options at the moment.

All fixed it seems. Funds are SAFU

So far during this run up we had a 25% drop earlier and we just had another one today making two. If $10,300 holds maybe 25% retracement is the new 30-40% retracement of this bull market. 30-40% correction would put us at $8200-$9600 range. A dip below 10k and we could see a quick panic down to 9k and below. Maybe quick dip and bounce over. People want into this market. I need sleep so I'm hoping for some sideways consolidation!

Yea let's hope funds are SAFU

Advertising and selling something someone wants would help. But I still think bitcoin for buying and retail still doesn't make sense. Why use something that could go up 1000x to buy something when you can just use fiat for now.
@_date: 2019-04-20 01:47:07
Definitely a rocket ship

I tweeted at them because I was having the same issue. They replied they are working on a fix and aware of the issue.

I thought I got exit scammed took a while but pretty cool he followed through and even gave me an extra drawing for the delay.

Yes they helped me with a dash wallet I forgot password about  at the height of the bubble wanted to convert to BTC. BTC though you need to have the best practices if they help you regain access to your funds. Buy a trezor. Make sure to have a copy of the recovery seed and password. This way your never in this horrific situation again. Best of luck in the recovery of the wallet
