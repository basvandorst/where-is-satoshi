**There's an interesting reason for this, and it has to do with business checking. See, most banks don't handle business checks in the same way they do for consumer accounts. If you try to draw a check against an account that doesn't have sufficient funds, they will simply refuse your check and you have to deal with the legal ramifications. A lot of these accounts don't get dinged for insufficient funds because they are payables and dealing with 200 accountants from XYZ, Inc. when your bank charges for a clerical error made by a temp employee isn't going to go over well.**
**Anyways, a good trick to get paid (at least partially) is to INCREMENTALLY INSERT MONEY INTO THE ACCOUNT you're trying to draw against until the check can clear.**

Looks like [a 1yr snapshot]( Somewhat oddly, they priced their monthly costs in Yen so I ran the numbers:
    Dollar revenue: $337,450
    BTC revenue translated into RIGHT NOW dollars: B52,400 * $5.50 = $288,200
    Total: $625,650
    Operating costs:
    ¥5,000,000 = $65,677
    ($65,677 * 12) = $788,124
As far as startups go, they seem to be in the stage where they establish dominance while sacrificing the near-term profitability (this means there is smart money at play). If I had to take a guess, they will probably secure the long term win as the "brand" for bitcoin with age. Being in Japan helps defray any of the latest U.S. government interference so that's one legal hurdle they hopefully won't have to deal with.

**OP clearly takes bitcoin advocacy in higher regard than solid hosting. Caveat emptor, but Site5 is a good company with good support staff and is actually fairly inexpensive. Man up and do the financial conversion yourself.**
