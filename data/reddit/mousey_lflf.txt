If you bought btc at anywhere under $1000 you're getting it very cheap. I'd call that a steal. 
Edit: my maths was just so so wrong.

Just heard from my dad about the prices it's 0.275 btc for 5 nights currently.

I'm so sorry they had to go through that. My dad didn't leave the island and was there through the whole storm. A truely humbling experience he said. Thanks for the support!

My heart goes out to you man. It's an all too familiar story. All the best for 2018.

Sorry if I'm being a bit confusing - my maths is obviously way off here. 
So let's say you bought btc at $1000. First of all, congrats. If you wanted to stay at the villa for 5 nights the 0.275 btc you'd spend today on affording that cost you $275 when you bought. Nice one. 
This is not 'whoosh' - my dad was in Irma and I'm attempting to help him out. Sorry if I'm confusing people.

We'll be here long after the dips, parabolic moves, mass adoption, burning of the fiat monoliths my friend. See you there one day!

Thanks dude, it's been real these last few months!Not begging at all - just reaching out to the crypto community to see if there's any interest! It's the sort of place you'd think 'boy I'd like a holiday like that if I got rich'. Crypto has done that for some people. You'd get the full service - just pay in btc if you like!

You can send my dad a Facebook message (link to the villa's Facebook is in the blurb of the post) or DM me for more details :)

I'm looking for specifically UK tubers - would be great if there was someone to discuss the think order book on GDAX which saw the price fall to £6,660 last night for 15 minutes! 
Also a few other topics. Meet ups. Like minded people around. It'd be nice to have our own guy or girl who did the sort of things at a community level but in the uk.

No joke! Take a look at the place! It's a beautiful villa.

Hurricane insurance is insanely expensive and doesn't cover a lot of things about the property - it made more sense to save the money and save it for a rainy day, quite literally. My dad made the right decision in not going with insurance because he's been able to repair and get ready for guests in under 4 months where many of his friends are still waiting on cheques which won't cover the cost they've paid since the last big hurricane in 1992 - Louis.

If anyone is wondering it's 5 nights minimum stay and that comes to 0.275btc at the moment of posting this.

Don't beat yourself up about it! It's easily done but you did the best you could at the time. No worries.
