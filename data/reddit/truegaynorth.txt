I'm still confused. Bisq never has my security deposit? 
If I want .5 btc and security deposit is .01 btc. I send seller .501 and seller sends me back the .01 once I verify I have the correct amount?
Or, I buy .5btc from seller. Send the .01btc to bisq and .5btc to seller? Then Bisq releases back security deposit?
I think I'm missing some basics here lol... will wiki/faq... thanks

Which would be when the receiver clicks the "I got this money" button? 
Is the security deposit released by adding the sellers sig? Or does bisq release it their own self. Sorry I don't have the terminology right! (I think I'm asking if it's 2:3 multisig? But that might be something else entirely)
I ask because I'm worried that if bisq becomes big, when all the coin combined from all security deposits is large enough bisq could just walk off with everybody's security deposit. (I feel like the solution is probably obvious and thought of long ago and implemented.) Just like to know for piece of mind and understanding.

Is it bitcoins dream that things be price fixed in btc instead of fiat? 
Like, go to the store and a candy bar is .02 mBTC? Instead of $1.25 or whatever.

Been using coinbase. Just found out I could easily switch over to coinbase pro and have more features and less or no fees. (I know cb might not be  choice but I'm fully validated and lazy.)
Scenario: I have funds in my USD wallet. The price is $6300. I place a limit order that says .1 btc and enter $6000 and submit..  this means I'll buy .1 if the price reaches $6000 right? I just want to be sure. 
Does placing a limit orders on the book effect the market? If tons of people put out limit orders at a low price would it do anything?
Does this work the other way, if enough people suddenly say they'll sell for $9000 would anything happen?

Security deposit is part of the trade? The deposit goes to the receiver as part of the total?
If I put in a security deposit and complete a trade my security deposit will still be at bisq?
How/when do you get your deposit back?
