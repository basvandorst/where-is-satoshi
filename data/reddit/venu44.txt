So now it's been months, and Im convinced OKPAY are in on the scam too. I have complained and opened tickets on both theirs and BTC and both just keep asking for more proof. It's just hilarious. I swear i could snap my foot off up the arse of these cowboys.

Seriously guys your risking it big time using this Russian scam site. There must be half a dozen nerds just creaming it in. They had the audacity to put up a news bulletin with regards MT GOX and then declare how 'good they are'.

Guess what, now after what must be the 20th ticket I have opened, I told one them to f*** Off when asked YET AGAIN to provide a screenshot of the transaction and now when i went to log in, my password miraculously no longer works and i cannot log onto the site. Scammers and dickheads.

These f****ing c**ts have just sent me another email asking for proof for the 4th time in as many weeks. DO NOT DEAL with them.

acnrep2014 is talking the truth - they are faceless Russian scammers.

Still absolutely nothing showing in my account now - it's been two weeks - they are a SCAM and I repeat this again, A SCAM. 
You must be very foolish to get involved with this broker site. They are going to rip you off big time, they will dissapear without a trace soon - just you wait and see.

Just had an email asking to provide screenshots and proof WTF, this is now nearly 3 weeks. I selected their OKPAY add funds button, entered the amount. I checked with OKPAY and its showing as sent. BTC want proof now? this is a joke.

I depostied a test amount of 10 EURO and it still has not appeared after ten days. I sent an email 3 days ago and today i got one that said "Hello... Fixed" and when i checked my account there was still absolutely nothing in the account. I would not trust them as far as i could throw them.
