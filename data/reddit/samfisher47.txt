Price does matter and a loss of value is still a loss of value, no matter how much you tell people you only lose if you sell.
Do you really think that price does not matter and mass adoption will occur when merchants cannot be certain if the $5,000 they got paid in BTC today will be worth $4,500 or $5,500 tomorrow?

Investors who speculated successfully does not make bitcoin successful as a store of value.

What does the security of the main chain or additional layers or side chains have to do with price or adoption or payments to merchants being stable?

Are you serious? So the only people who don't have to buy that crap are people who had already bought that crap (probably with fiat) at some point.


Maybe you should reconsider why you think you don't have to buy **anything** to start using bitcoin.

$5,000 =&gt; $4,500 is still a 10% loss in value. Why do you think that isn't important?


Merchants want to secure the value of the goods or services they provided, not manage risk and adjust their portfolios to prevent loss of profits.
