luke-jr hacked mtgox,what are the chances?
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:20:01
Thats because miners are making free money,they earn bitcoins for processing transactions
Just like how a checkout worker gets paid from the store,its the same princable
It is free money because you can pay off the power bill with your bitcoins exchanged to usd, why would that not make sense?
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:56:56
please dont temm me his death was related to mtgox
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:04:35
Why would you mine at 7gh with todays difficulty?
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:26:56
Earning it by doing nothing,all you need is a high hashrate and everything can pay for it self, "ITS FREE MONEY"
hence free goods from overstock,thats why people are happy
miners wont have this luxary life for much long when the next generation miners hit, that is a fact,by that time difficulty will be sky high and no one will want to keep miners on to process transactions, bitcoin will die slowly
@_date: 2014-01-10 10:27:39
Yahoo will be fined alot for sure
@_date: 2014-09-19 20:32:00
show me a news site with this news then i might believe
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:37:27
Mining works like this,you purchase hardware which is callled asic bitcoin miners.
You leave them on 24/7 to process transactions that are happening on the network
So if you pool mine and you have a high hashrate such as 550gh you can basically make free bitcoins and use them to buy things, its just like getting money for nothing really, you dont have todo anything apart from leave it running and walk away, the currect miners are in for a shock once the difficulty becomes to hard,thats when we say RIP bitcoin

@_date: 2014-03-01 05:57:00
The question is did mark pay some guys in china to login to accounts tomake it look like it was hackers or was it genuie hackers that stole the whole database of user accounts for mtgox.
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:46:40

@_date: 2014-01-10 16:51:04

@_date: 2014-03-29 02:15:30
what are you talking about, the litecoin difficulty has been increased because of gridseed,i dont even think knc have a scrypt prototype yet so how would they be mining with them now, WTF?
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:12:46
You know why right?
Because this gives the people mining more hope
Hence free bitcoins as a reward for processing a retail stores transactions,thats why.
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:22:14
Why not say more than 1 Computer?
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:50:30
It is free money, bitcoins are made from mining

Miners are earning it yes, but the miners are making it free because everything paid for its self , hence the word "free"
