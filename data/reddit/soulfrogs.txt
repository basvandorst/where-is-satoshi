Gonna HODL!

Bitcoin is famously used for pizza though.

Seriously, can you PLEASE think of a new insult? It seems like I see you call someone mentally ill every other day.
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:59:35
That's probably the best, most simple explanation of Bitcoin I've heard.
@_date: 2019-03-09 10:44:52
They've also mentioned Bitcoin in 3 past episodes.
@_date: 2018-10-19 10:53:46
I don't find that surprising, given the sad state of quarter 2.
@_date: 2018-10-29 15:13:13
Heh. Well done.
@_date: 2018-10-29 05:24:37
Try not to broadcast how much Bitcoin you have. It could make you a target for hackers
and scams.

I've been using it for a few months and I'm up to $21.44 (0.0034). Just got my first 5 dollar task. It's easy for free bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:19:17
I love when people give educated, measured responses.
Well done.
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:17:21
Solid plan.
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:32:48
The less miners there are, the smaller the hashrate and vise versa.
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:45:09
Good point, but I'll just hold on to hope that it will be universal.
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:25:00
5 to 7 sounds about right. I'm in for the long haul anyway, so I can wait.
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:42:26
But why sell in 2030? Lol
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:28:18
Bitcoin: Such a good idea, even a litany of hacks won't stop us!
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:23:24
Fair enough.
I'm no stranger to volatility but in this particular case I would caution against giving in to FOMO.
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:42:40
In my opinion we are. ATH doesn't have any bearing.
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:40:05
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:36:55
This improves the thread.
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:21:38
Any good?
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:01:07
and thank goodness for that. Wanted to buy yesterday but couldnt get the funds 'til today.
@_date: 2018-07-19 20:58:54
Are you crazy?! 
Who would throw a perfectly good m&amp;m?!
@_date: 2018-07-12 07:56:16
...But aren't you telling him what not to write?
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:34:54
Delta is great.
@_date: 2018-07-26 01:36:02
But Bitcoin runs on a ledger. Doesn't that mean others CAN see what you do with it?
@_date: 2018-07-21 11:13:09
When the value of Bitcoin quickly rises, holds, then quickly falls, forming a shape that is spiky on top and flat on the sides. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 06:09:26
You can start by reading the whitepaper here
@_date: 2018-12-03 10:43:53
Sheesh. Just trying to improve morale around here, Mr. buzzkill...
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:57:41
If that website existed, members would be painting a target on their back by announcing how much bitcoin they had. That's just begging for scammers and hackers.
