 would fix most of the issues seen on that page.

It is all their server configs. Their C rating has to do with being vulnerable to poodle, using rc4, and not using forward secret ciphers. All easy to fix, but makes it look like they didn't even try to care.

For the unaware, what exactly is inaccurate?

To leach off of the top comment, I work on a tor browser bundle extension named [darkweb everywhere]( that makes it really easy to use hidden services.
You can connect to blockchain.info and it will automatically redirect you to the onion. There are a lot of other sites that have this set up, like Facebook and Duckduckgo. Give it a go. It's easy to use.

Do you have a citation on this?
If it's true that is pretty cool of Microsoft.

I2P has a very active C++ port named [i2pd](
It is not fully ready, but is on its way.

Relevent information is on page 12.
Microsoft signed off on 688 LOC, totaling to 1% of the changes.
It is not clear to me if this means they wrote any code?
I cannot find any information about Canonical or Ubuntu in this document.

There are private keys, isn't there?

Since this is served over HTTP it might be a bad idea to use these addresses for real transactions.
Edit: the github pages version is HTTPS (

Yes. I took a class with a guy who wrote a book on this. If you're interested I can post the book title.

It is. But they are all implemented by people who do not understand computer security.

Paul Graham thought of this a while ago.

Why are you skeptical? (serious)

Good call.

I really don't think this is a Sybil attack. A Sybil attack would be taking up most of a network to attack it (usually DOS or analysis). Everyone already has the information on the blockchain.

Blockchain.info also has a tor hidden service.

Electrum uses a dictionary that has n number of words, so for example:
1. cat
2. dog
3. chair
4. ...
If your password is "dog cat chair", then it really corresponds to 213.
There are obviously a lot more in their dictionary. Assuming they have 1,000 words, that means to brute force the password would take [a lot]( of attempts.
