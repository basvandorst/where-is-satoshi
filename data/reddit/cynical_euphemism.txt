Ars Technica about a child porn honeypot: 
Slashdot article about a carding ring honeypot: 
(Original linked article is gone, I'll try and find a link to back it up...)
I've seen a few other stories pop up in my news feed over the last few years... I'll see what else I can dig up as examples.  (There's a few more stories I think I saw on Ars, and a couple from Krebs On Security)
Edit 1: CarderProfit sting:

Oh, I don't doubt that it's safer than the street... and you're correct, I'm not intimately familiar with how SR specifically is set up - I'm mainly familiar with general encryption / cryptography and network security on the enterprise side of stuff.  
As far as the law enforcement actions &amp; capabilities, I just know what pops up in my tech news feed, and what I've seen so far of the SR takedown and return fits the pattern.  Regardless of whether I'm right or wrong, I'll be curious to see how this shakes out in the next couple years.

My prediction - Ulbricht was offered a deal where if he cooperated, he'd get a reduced sentence.  Some # of the former admins were ID'd and flipped as well.  The new PGP key addition is to be able to more closely tie a specific person to an online account making for easier convictions.
They'll let this run for 1-2yrs, logging and tracking *everything*, maybe making incidental arrests where they can get away with it, without letting on that the site is compromised.  At the end of the run, they'll coordinate a massive global arrest of everyone involved to prevent tipoffs, then we'll see a big news story after the fact bragging about the operation and how they pulled it off.

I think you're giving me too much credit... it's not a "theory" backed by "conspiratard reasoning", as you so eloquently put it.  
I'm not trying to prove anything actually, just making a prediction that could be proved right or wrong in a couple years time.  In terms of credibility, it's about on par if I'd said "I bet $NFL_Team will win the 2015 Super Bowl".  Take it however you'd like.

You might be surprised... :)  But to clarify, I wasn't talking about cracking the encryption, only that if LEOs caught someone w/ a private key on their computer, it would make it easier to prove that person was the one sending the messages / transactions, and not just someone acting as a proxy.  (I.e. The "It wasn't me, I got hacked, I had no idea" excuse)

Of course not - if there were proof, then no one would use the site.  There's also no proof that it's legit.  That's the problem.

How's my month old prediction looking now? :)  I won't say it's confirmed, but it's looking likely.  I'm betting we'll be seeing more of these types of stories pop up in the next few months.

More like what happened with Sabu and LulzSec is what I'm thinking.  Less "tinfoil hat", and more "betcha I'll have a smug 'told you so' to point to in a couple years."
As far as legality - look at the way law enforcement busts carding rings and kiddie porn rings.  They run the forums, do the bare minimum to keep credibility, then use the evidence they've gathered.  Something tells me they're happy to use any legal grey area they can justify.

And you're confident that none of them were caught &amp; flipped, or had their accounts compromised?
