I've been day trading gdax for a week. So far so good earned .103 if these buy orders go through

12-25-2017 8:15 AM. Just as you take that first sip of coffee and get ready to open some presents.

I have it in a market account. Does my wallet receive b2x? Why?
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:00:52
I need it to hit 5k to hit all of my buy orders starting at 6. Scary for a first timer in a dip.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:12:44
It was absolutely the answer your coins are on exchanges you are not holding s***
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:01:14
I just bought :/

I can pull this off in the gdax side of things? I have btc hodling over there
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:53:32
Sold my entire position today at 7800 not holding any Bitcoin was definitely scary had buy orders all the way down to 7500 they have all triggered now I feel much better.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:04:00
Please hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:59:17
In the end isn't that the goal, no more Fiat?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:23:23
Same shit. Cex.io worked for me but they had some serious fees
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:45:57
On an exchange is not in a wallet that you control the keys to
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:57:45
I need it to drop to 7100 just for a min before it heads to 8500

Totally agree with your line of thinking, I just bought my bch hedge too high, but I'll give it time to mature, not trying to day trade except for a small portion I can lose slowly over time as I fail to time the market over and over.

With ya, waiting on a ACH for days
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:52:57
I am on day 3 of waiting for a deposit is ACH wire transfer to coinbase and then move to gdax if I'd known about the $10 fee I probably would have wire transferred it but that was right before this decline, so I guess it worked out as long as they give me my money soon
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:12:37
We can cuddle through this. I just bought, please don't drop.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:59:16
Oh totally,  did it on gdax, the money does me no good sitting as USD right now, so put it all in at once. I understand dollar cost averaging as a long-term buying habit and I do you engage in that however this was one lump and its Destiny was to buy Bitcoin. Is there any reason in that scenario to not just buy in also assuming I have a favorable view of the long-term outlook for Bitcoin

Same story same day my funds  just cleared. Sucks to miss out on the dip but at least we're in before 10
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:08:20
What about gdax?
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:23:29
I saw Bitcoin at 71 and thought I should get in on it I put a substantial amount of money into coinbase through ACH during the pending time I saw Bitcoin go to below $6,000 and now back up to its normal health. My funds cleared just a couple minutes ago while it's been fun watching the action on the sidelines. I just bought in at 7000. Missed out on all the dip fun All I can hope is that it climbs

Totally new to this but how is Bitcoin cash more or less centralized than Bitcoin with bitstream having all the Bitcoin developers in one place? I have no idea.
