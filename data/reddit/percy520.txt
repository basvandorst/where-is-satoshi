what is the real chance (in percentage) of success on this 20% double-spending attack? I think ppc will become much secure when Sunny adds the cold-locked minting feature on PPC. I guess the 20% of active stakes at the moment could well be less than 1 millions ppc because larger stake holders won't risk their coins to mint ppc. I only mint every 90 days. But PPC has a central checkpoint to protect it at the moment. Once cold-locked minting available I believe many of ppc holders will mint ppc which will significantly increase the number of active stakes, so will increase the ppc's security and then Sunny can remove the central checkpoint. Do you agree this?

POS will save bitcoin in the future and at the moment PPC will be a better investment in term of ROI in the next 3 years.

It seems you keep changing mind on ppc. I read some your posts in PPC's very early days and you criticized it heavily. But four months ago you recommended it and now you against it again.

Totally agreed. I don't understand why NXT's developer chose this stupid way to distribute the coins. Even NXT is an awesome coin, its unfair distribution will leave it no chance to success. Personally, I will not invest in NXT  just because of the ridiculous distribution.

If I remember it correctly, you had indicated in the past that it only require as little as 20% something of active stake to make a 51% attack on ppc, is it true?
Also do you mind to disclose that if you possess any ppc? Just interesting to know how much do you actually rate it. You can leave the question if you feel not comfortable to answer. thanks.
