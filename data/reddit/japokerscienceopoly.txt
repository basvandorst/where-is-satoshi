Because the price is still in $ and no doubt he'd be converting it back into USD when the sale is complete. It's just a marketing ploy.

This is why I cannot take bitcoin seriously. As long as regulations are fought against, it doesn't deserve to succeed as a currency.

Still much safer than having money in a digital wallet. How many stories do you hear/read of about people who deleted/lost hundreds of thousands of £'s worth of BTC? Compare that to the number of times the banks have defaulted on their debts. Heck, the  government spent billions to keep the banks afloat. Our money is incredibly safe in banks.

Aren't they all selling via third parties though? One's who take BTC from A and pays B in $?
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:39:35

Yeah don't listen to this guy. Fraud isn't something you want to be getting into.

Why would you walk down the street with $3,500 in your pocket instead of on a debit card? That's the equivalent of having no password on your BTC wallet.
@_date: 2014-08-25 23:51:17


Why not? If a bank has 20m BTC in reserves from people who are saving, they can loan out 10m BTC fairly safely, as it's unlikely that the people who are saving are all going to withdraw their savings.
The bank will have 10m BTC in reserve but owe 20m BTC. Same as it is with $ or £.
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:32:24
Don't listen to people begging you to hold/sell. Treat it as though you have $9k and you have the choice of gambling on BTC or not. If someone gave you $9k in the street, would you put it in BTC? That's what you have to ask yourself. Just remember that everyone on this sub more than likely has BTC so will want you to hold to help increase the value.
I'd probably take it out as $ if I were you.

Reads exactly like an answer for one of my exams. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 23:11:39
How else would i mean intrinsic value other than in the literal sense? 
~~USD has more intrinsic value currently than BTC as it is legal tender and can be used to pay debts. Nobody has to accept BTC, but everyone has to accept USD if a debt it owed to them~~ ~~(with some minor restrictions).~~
~~That's where the intrinsic value lies.~~ BTC's value is wholly based on trust and speculation. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 23:23:13
Fair point. Still, BTC does not have intrinsic value whichever way you or anyone else wants to word it. (and being *really* pedantic, USD has the intrinsic value of the paper it's printed on, but yeah, that's being silly)
@_date: 2016-06-16 23:55:04
Nah one from last year. One of the ACA exams.

No. Transfer initial investment to a safe and stable investment like USD. Gamble with the rest if you like 
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:17:39
I'd cash out your original investment if I were you
@_date: 2016-06-16 23:25:15
Yeah, but that is not intrinsic value. Intrinsic value means that it will serve a purpose even if it wasn't being used as a currency. Eg: Gold has intrinsic value because it is useful as an electrical conductor, so even if people completely stopped investing in gold, it would still have value. If people stopped investing, spending, etc with BTC, it would be absolutely literally worthless.
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:26:59
Does BTC have intrinsic value? What is it?
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:22:34
You take how much one Bitcoin is worth and then make it zero
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:03:29
Because it holds genuine value rather than just perceived value. Gold can be sold as a commodity to be used, even if it all goes tits up. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 17:45:06
So you're selling it in $, not BTC...

So someone has to man every single road in the country? That's an incredibly inefficient use of resources. Also, how do you stop people charging extortionate amounts because local residents have no other choice than to use their road?


Yep, but the free market doesn't allow for those who simply cannot afford it. A free market means that someone who can't afford cannot get healthcare, meaning that we are condemning the poor to death.


The army in 1776 didn't have jets, missiles, international surveillance (incl. satellites), nuclear weapons, etc. I don't know how much it would cost, but I'm sure as hell that people won't donate enough to keep it running nowadays.

I've got a Santander account and can send money within seconds. Don't have a NFC card with them though, got Coop for that.

Do you know the difference between inflation and deflation? BTC is deflating rapidly due to hoarders and the nature of BTC itself. 
The value of the BTC halved in value overnight, the value of the LTC increased in value by 150% in as little as 10 hours few weeks ago. Has the USD or GBP done this?
@_date: 2013-07-02 20:19:09
I hope this is sarcasm too. Are you saying that society would be better if we didn't have a structured, well-funded government?
@_date: 2013-07-02 20:17:28
Yes, but the roads would not be repaired, universities would not be subsidised, the poor wouldn't receive welfare. Everything that the government pays for will go to shit. Taxes are good for a society, as it funds the things that people aren't willing to pay for themselves if they had the choice.
@_date: 2013-07-03 00:09:45
...okay? I was just responding to something that was posted (and highly upvoted) on Why use the roads argument in the first place if you're just mocking people for using it themselves.
How will we pay for repairing the roads then?

All this proves is that the only time hyperinflation occurred was when there was huge political turmoil in a country. Out of the past century and with hundreds and hundreds of currencies, only 6 of them have suffered hyperinflation. I'd say that paints fiat in a good light.

But we need more expensive equipment nowadays. Universities are doing much more detailed work than they have been doing. Scientists are exploring the minuscule details of our universe with the LHC that was funded by [about 20 governments]( (I know that isn't a university but it's still scientific advancements).


I doubt that most of the population would be that willing to donate. I've heard many, many people complaining about people receiving benefits, saying that they should "just get a job" etc.


Emergency services, welfare, education, healthcare, laws &amp; the justice system etc.

Hardly anyone would pay because "it doesn't matter if I don't pay because enough people will so it won't matter."


Nationalised healthcare is the primary thing that the UK is praised for, and are you saying that we should get rid of the army? No army means we're basically saying "we can be easily invaded" to the next crazy foreign leader.

I got to the third post on the all-time top and found [this.](
The final statement is completely true. Taxpayers would have no hope in hell of paying for an organised road system without some sort of middleman to pool together everyone's payments to pay the construction company.
But there are 350m people to collect payment from. How do we judge who pays what? Do we split it up evenly? No because then the poor will not be able to afford it. Do we split up how much each person pays based on how rich they are? That seems fairer, let's set up a way of finding out how much each person earns/spends and charge them accordingly.
Oh look, we've formed a taxation system similar to the one we've got.
