You are correct. Holding all of your wealth in USD cash under your mattress is a bad investment strategy.
[USD returns on bonds and stocks have far outpaced inflation](
Holding U.S. Stocks is one of the best *historically proven* investments (yes, bitcoin returns have been stellar, but will bitcoin be around in 100 hundred years? No one knows, but the U.S. economy sure will be around).

If bitcoin is forever deflationary then borrowing it is a bad decision. Your future debt payments will become more and more expensive. Ask Asian emerging market countries in 1998 how borrowing U.S. Dollars worked out for them.
My view is fiat and bitcoin will do to some money what "veggie lovers" and "meat lovers" pizza does at Pizza Hut. I.e. create market segmentation.
For transactions where near instant final settlement and immutability are paramount, then bitcoin will serve this market segment. 
For transactions that require long-term trust, or matching cash flows generated by an asset with borrowing (e.g. [borrowing money to get a college degree that increases your lifetime earnings by more than the cost of the debt]( then people will use fiat.
[Market segmentation is already happening within crypto-currencies]( Most sovereign nations print their own currency (natural segmentation), why not segmentation between crypto-fiat?

Yes. I am skeptical of Ethereum’s smart contracts (we have already seen two high profile blow ups - Parity and DAO).
I just wanted your thoughts on on-chain v. off-chain. My view is on-chain gives the benefit you know how much money is being created through the M0 to M2 money multiplier. Off-chain I don’t see as different from today’s banks.
All this said, you are correct, lending is inherently a business of trust. So crypto-currencies may be relegated to zero maturity money only.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:47:59
Yes. Elsewhere in this thread I concede this is possible. If so, then bitcoin fees are too easily gamed, and the transaction capacity constraint is a flaw in the codebase.

In economics, the universal arbiter is [marginal benefits equals marginal cost]( This is how money will be distributed and allocated. 
Interestingly, I just noticed arbitrage may be a derivation from the fact if marginal benefit does not equal marginal cost, then an arbitrageur will act to correct the situation by exploiting the profit opportunity.
Now whether or not the individual actor is incorporating all the correct costs and benefits (i.e. externalities) is another issue.
Yes, prices are a signalling mechanism for money allocation.
A stock is a claim of ownership on a future stream of cash-flow. I am not seeing how bitcoin can replace this. What do you mean?

To quote a conclusion of Robert Mundell, Professor of Economics at Columbia University, on "Uses and Abuses of Gresham's Law in the History of Money" (1998):

No. You are ignoring opportunity costs.

@_date: 2017-12-23 04:37:23
You can't cancel, but you can replace-by-fee (i.e. pay more money in transaction fees to accelerate the transaction). Look up "bitcoin transaction accelerator."
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:47:40
No. Margin on bitcoin futures is greater than 30% meaning for every $1 worth of bitcoin exposure, the futures trader needs to maintain at least $0.30 of equity. Margin is cash-settled daily. For the trader to be forced liquidated, bitcoin's price has to move by more than 30% in the time between daily settlements (assuming they are using maximum leverage).

@_date: 2017-12-24 06:01:37
Right, but this seems plausible, and more importantly only possible given the transaction capacity constraint. Is this a fatal flaw?
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:28:16
That’s part of the thesis I have. If there is no lending of bitcoin (fractional or otherwise), then is bitcoin only useful for zero maturity transactions. If transactions have multi-year cash flows, then people will use fiat and traditional banking.

By the way, to me *the* finance problem is the [problem of inter-temporal choice]( Or in other words, what to do with your money given the time value of money :)

I agree with you. There is moral hazard in today’s financial system.
My naive view is a banking system with on-chain loan contracts will solve one of the problems that created the last financial crisis. Last decade there was too much off balance sheet borrowing and lending, and no one who was lending to whom.

I agree there is scope for collaboration. However, bitcoin does not need a top-down authority coordinating activity. Bitcoin works best when you have self-interested actors (developers, miners, holders, merchants, etc.) all seeking to earn a profit. It is emergent order. 
For example, if SegWit can lower transaction fees, but an exchange has not implemented it yet, this is a good sign the costs of implementing it exceed the benefits (i.e. not a profitable use of resources). Exchanges compete fiercely with each other, if SegWit provided them a competitive advantage, they would all rush to implement it.

Yes, my opinion is cypto-fiat will live symbiotically. Each serving a different market segment the way macOS and Windows live symbiotically - you can transfer value (files) between the two, but at heart, they are different animals with respect to user experience.
I am not familiar with Gresham's law. A quick wiki search shows it only applies to physical commodity money (i.e. money like copper, gold, or silver that can be used for pipes, and jewelry)? Does this apply to bitcoin? Please explain to me Gresham's law. This seems to only apply in the world where you can "clip" your gold coins and make a good coin in a bad one.
Also, by logical fact, the converse of a true statement is not necessarily true. Only the contra-positive of a true statement is necessarily true.
If my theory on market niche is true, then hyperbitcoinization is impossible. If my theory is false, then who knows what the future holds.
My view of crypto-currencies occupying a niche (albeit this niche could be trillions of dollars) stems from the fact different people have different preferences.

Yes, bankers know lending in an inflationary environment is bad that’s why they charge you a premium to the inflation rate when you borrow from them. At least for long maturities.

A bank is a specific financial institution that matches people with too much money with those people who need money.
Bitcoin the protocol can have a banking layer built on top of it as bitcoin is sound money. But the protocol itself does not facilitate borrowing or lending.

Not quite. I am happy to help clarify. Please read [this article]( that explains what I described above.
I don’t know how to answer your questions because I don’t understand them. 
Note: arbitrageurs will buy spot price and sell the futures price, and speculators will buy/sell the futures price only and speculate on price movements just like how a spot price speculator does.
I fear I may only confuse you further until you understand what is being bought and sold by the arbitrageurs.

See the futures pricing equation [here](
When the asset does not pay dividends, and assuming the cost of storing bitcoin is no greater than LIBOR, then the futures price *must* be greater than the spot price due to the interest rate on borrowing money.
A futures price greater than spot price will result in net buying pressure on the underlying. 
But you are correct, it *can* work the other way (net selling pressure on bitcoin), if and only if the cost of carry is greater than the money market interest rate - which I see as highly unlikely based on my experience.

Yes! 
It took me a while to reconcile this in the past. The economics of  bitcoin mining are fascinating.

See the chain of comments [here](
The price of gold (or any physical commodity) is set by the marginal cost of production - i.e. the cost of extracting gold from the least efficient gold miner sufficient to satisfy demand. [Marginal revenue equals marginal cost](
If the price of gold was manipulated in any material way, the world's most valuable company would be a gold miner as that would indicate they are earning an "economic rent." The world's [most valuable company]( is Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil enterprise). It should be self-evident the price of oil *is* manipulated by [OPEC]( but again, oil price manipulation is not conducted via financial futures contracts - it is manipulated through cartels of physical production.

The CME Group, arguably the world's most liquid futures exchange, will begin listing bitcoin futures within several weeks. Futures contracts are financial derivatives, an asset whose price is determined by an underlying asset. CME's bitcoin futures will settle in USD, thus, traditional financial institutions will be able to effectively trade bitcoin - i.e. speculate on the price movements of bitcoin.
You will note: the futures contracts settle in USD. How does this affect the price of bitcoin? The answer lies in the arbitrageurs who will straddle *both* the futures market and the market for the underlying bitcoin. 
This is getting technical so before proceeding, I want to provide an analogy. ExxonMobil operates in both the market for physical oil and the futures market for oil. ExxonMobil is in the business of drilling for oil, and not speculating on the price of oil; thus, ExxonMobil sells (short) oil futures contracts to mitigate the price volatility of the oil they own (and are  long) before they can physically sell it.
I hope this idea of hedging is clear. Now, here is why the CME bitcoin futures contracts are bullish for the price of bitcoin in the coming weeks to months. The bitcoin futures arbitrageurs will hedge in a manner similar to ExxonMobil. Arbitrageurs are not in the business of speculating on the price of bitcoin, they are in the business of lending money to people who buy futures contracts.
Buyers of futures contracts are using [margin]( (i.e. borrowing money). The interest rate at which arbitrageurs lend is determined by the market (but my guess it will be slightly greater than [LIBOR](
What happens in financial markets when you can earn interest rates higher than LIBOR effectively risk-free? Large financial players make trades worth billions of dollars.
Here is the punch-line (or the **TL;DR**), arbitrageurs will sell short bitcoin futures contracts and buy the underlying bitcoin. This buying of underlying bitcoin will be bullish for the price of bitcoin - billions of dollars of new money will seek to buy bitcoin.

The CME futures launch this December is not a guarantee. There are regulatory and operational hurdles to complete. Nonetheless, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) is also looking to create a bitcoin futures contract. It is a race between CME and CBOE since whoever gets the first launch will have all the volume and network effect. Hence, the ambitious time table by CME.
If bitcoin futures launch, I will not sell thereafter. I am neither a “trader” nor a holder. My interest (no pun intended) with bitcoin is margin lending, and researching bitcoin money markets.

See my other comment here, but here is a bonus economic fact: the price of bitcoin satisfies the “quantity theory of money” equation - I.e. Coinbase multiplied by velocity of coins = (BTC per unit of value) multiplied by units of value transacted per unit of time.
Rearranging the equation to solve for market capitalization you will find “value transacted per time” is the key driver of price.

Thanks for the context. I agree with you that article (the chart in particular) is awful.

The twitter post is misleading. 0% fees are for market makers (i.e. the standing orders in the book). Every trade is between a maker and taker (i.e. when someone's bid hits an ask or vice versa). Thus, every trade is paying 0.075%.
By definition, there can be no trade between two makers. Thus, no trade can execute at 0% fees.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:44:20
Correct. It is a one-time thing. Once the arbitrage money is in, it won’t push the price any higher. Think of it like the gas pedal on a car, if you don’t press the pedal (I.e. new arbitrage money coming in), then the price won’t go higher. 
This makes bitcoin sound like a Ponzi scheme, but it is not one. Instead the price of bitcoin is dictated by the quantity theory of money: coinbase multiplied by velocity of bitcoins = price of bitcoin multiplied by value transacted on-chain.
Thus, as long as the value transacted on chain is growing, then the price of bitcoin will rise. (Note: arbitrageurs will transact on chain, but their pushing on the gas pedal is finite).

The analysis presented suffers from survivorship bias. It's conclusions can not be relied upon to draw any statistical inferences. The author is finding successful assets, then arbitrarily highlighting they suffered large draw-downs in the past; thus, implying bitcoin is "hardened" by it's previous draw-downs - this is a false conclusion. Bitcoin's value will grow in proportion to the network's value as a medium of exchange *and* a store of value.
