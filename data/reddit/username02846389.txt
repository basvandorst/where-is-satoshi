I lost 1000 BTC i bought way back in 2006 Anyone welcome to donate me : 
What happened is that my cat took my ledger because somehow he got access to my keys, He tried to open my safe but it was locked by 10 satoshis. He then used a hard fork to open it . Then stole my ledger. My cat knows who Satoshi is. Hint: hes not my dad. 
Anyways anyone welcome donate to me .
(If this is a true story , sorry for mocking you OP) 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:37:27
TLDR: is your cat ok?
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:23:21

@_date: 2018-02-14 06:01:32
Nah, maybe? But .. i dont see it . Im not even talking about just BTC, im talking about blockchains distributed ledger in general. 
Decnetralization of information and such, read ENIGMA Protocol Whitepaper . It tells the reason why something needs to be decentralized and the importance of decentralization. 
In thw future, nodes are gonna be used to run a blockchain, BTC has always been the gold standard, to buy other cryptocurrency , i doubt it will go away, it dropping down to 900$ would squander all the potential for other blockchain tech . 
1 Satoshi is gonna be the basis . 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:37:52
69 %
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:51:15
Why will it go to 900?
When it wont hit 1000$ because everyone is bullish on it and will just buy more as soon as it hits 5000
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:52:15
