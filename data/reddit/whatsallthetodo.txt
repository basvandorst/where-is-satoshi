And so should the UK police have these powers, the UK doesn’t want more and more dirty money buying property and pushing up house prices.
And why should hard working people have to sit back and watch criminals, live the high life, while they all toil at work.

Aren’t those OTC trades more ghost trades I meant, I would also want a good deal if I was buying 150 BTC I agree, not doubting your plan.
Just wondered how OTC trades effect supply and demand, if I buy of coinbase they’re sales and buys are logged, we can see from those sales real time supply and demand metrics in action.
Aren’t I right thinking I could buy 10’000 BTC (OTC) and not effect the price upwards because it’s an un recorded sale?.
So like BAKKT who have declared settlement in physical BTC to their customers, they will have to buy either OTC, directly from the miners, or off an exchange like coinbase.
Am I wrong thinking that exchange sales increases price faster and higher?
I know sooner or later if BAKKT is successful supply will decrease because of the set mining limit per day of BTC globally, basic common sense says if you sell more than you mine price must increase.
But surely if those are always ghost sales (OTC) no one really does know what the true supply out their is?.

@_date: 2018-10-28 11:31:26
Yes but those bitcoins came from miners, all BTC originally come from miners.
OTC counters buy from miners direct, or can do.
And you’re answering the same question you claim i’m in correct about (supply and demand), not being funny but isn’t that what I wrote originally.
The price anyway isn’t collapsing it’s been trading sideways for months, it’s more stable than its ever been.
How are you working out it’s collapsing.
You said there are more sellers than buyers right, now change it around, more buyers than sellers, you seem to understand supply and demand after all, as I told you originally, yet you bizarrely said i don’t understand it.

Those tiny countries, that need the US military to back them up.
�� Like that tiny country in Asia called Vietnam, as far as I can remember I saw footage of the Americans fleeing the Vietnamese with their tails between their legs, because Americans being Americans they’d started a war they couldn’t win and they didn’t have the taste for long term.
IMO and probably most military historians, it’s not clear whether the US has ever won a war ��.
Started lots but winning those wars isn’t what I’d call it, I mean take a look, show me one war you’ve started with a foe that has a decent airforce?.
Oh and read the dates in the history books, in the Second World War you never entered the war until the end, the Europeans and the Russians basically made things easier for you to enter.
And then there was the Japanese, well they would have beat you eventually if you’d have not resorted to nuclear weapons.
No while Europe was being attacked you the Americans were sat on your arses building up the American dream, you had a financial head-start on the rest of Europe and elsewhere.
NOW FUNNILY ENOUGH, look how most of those small places are better off than you hahah, you know small places like Germany ect.
Isn’t that where the yanks buy their cars, you know BMW AUDI ect, not TESLA, proper cars, I think it is, go and look at their sales then look at Tesla.
Anything else you’d like to get completely wrong, most don’t fancy your chances if you take on China in a war, you’ll end up loosing.
Medical advancement ummm, you should be able to lower your huge debts then through tax on those new drugs.

Presumably the sell off when the bubble burst last xmas would have made a lot of BTC available, but I can’t see why anyone would sell any significant amounts yet.
You could be right about miners not having access to that amount, I’d like a miner to say yes or no.
Interesting though.

That’s why trumps started a trade war with China, because the US is potless.

But even if that’s the  case and you were dismissed, there are tribunals here in the U.K. that you could use to sue them for wrongful dismissal.

Would you like to explain your thinking on that, I can send you some links to explain to you how supply and demand work, I don’t think you’re very clear about it.
I reiterate, if the demand outstrips supply  available the price must increase, if the price doesn’t increase that market is being manipulated so that the price is subdued.
You can read into this link and then explain why i’m wrong about price will increase if supply is low and demand high, personally I don’t think you have a clue?
@_date: 2018-10-28 09:16:25
No thank you I find it very interesting indeed as I cannot myself work out why BTC price isn’t rising firstly.
All I can agree with or think is that these are miners stocks that are stored and sold later when the price increases, as mining isn’t always as profitable when prices crash, so logically they store them and sell at a later date.
But yes please inform me after you’ve spoke with them again, I do wonder how BAKKT are going to buy their BTC, how confusing.
Good luck.
@_date: 2018-10-28 14:06:31
So the 25,000 OTC order won’t impact the price upwards if bought through an OTC desk, instead it will just be a large purchase that goes reasonably unnoticed ?
If I understand you correctly and what I’ve said is right in response, wouldn’t it be better for BTC price if all trades went through regulated exchanges then, surely the price would go up faster.?
@_date: 2018-10-28 09:03:57
Very interesting and as I said also I’m not an expert, in fact I thought OTC worked differently, I thought I could buy OTC cheaper because I was buying volume.
If I put a buy order in on an exchange I can only buy at what someone is willing to sell at, depending on the day I may make or lose, but OTC I would want that BTC cheaper period, one BTC is 6400 and you want” 150 “so let’s say you are willing to buy at 6200, I thought because those BTC were effectively not logged and they must have been bought cheaper in the first place, you the client should save and do a deal with the OTC counter desk that sells them.
Otherwise why not just put a buy order in on an exchange?.
Maybe someone will come on this post and clear this up as I want to know also,there are meant to be 15 million BTC in storage by hodlers, then their are the loses and thefts (hacks), BTC reward is 12.5 BTC per block reward each 10 minutes, “SO if BTC is being adopted” and these figures are correct, surely we should already be in a situation of limited supply, yet the price is stable.
I cannot work it out?.
Anyone else please join in.

The network effect of private keys, if Bakkt have 100’000 investors and those investors all buy and keep their own coins and keys, the hackers have 100’000 wallet challenge to gain access to those BTC.
If you have an institution keep those BTC in 10 different wallets they have only 10 now to hack for the same rewards.
I understand your problem, but coinbase will be hacked it’s when not if, and of course traders have to keep a balance in wallets on an exchange(risk for reward) that’s different to a hodler, a hodler should always be in charge of their private key.

@_date: 2018-11-29 16:32:36
The best thing anyone can do, and I mean anyone who’s involved in BITCOIN is to convince all these so called OTC (over the counter buyers) to stop fucking buying OTC, and buy on an exchange.
It’s so simple, this pushes the price up, the pubic follow because of fear of missing out FOMO, and everyone gets rich.
While people are supposedly buying OTC expect flat stagnant or not existent price rises. ��‍♂️

You may find this article interesting, I mean you say the government can’t get your BTC, yet they’ve managed to get the BTC and the private keys from many a criminal.
Here is why, because if they wanted your private key which you declare they couldn’t get, all they have to do is lock you up so you’re systematically bum fucked nightly in your cell, it wouldn’t take much for you to spit your private key if they wanted it.

I’m not convinced by 2 issues you’ve brought forward.
Firstly the start part satoshi’s vision, well BTC doesn’t work as satoshi envisaged because it didn’t scale.
The next part is that you see a BITCOIN being worth a lot of money as a hurdle for adoption, this isn’t correct as buying a small part anytime could make you wealthy, you not I, nor anyone else can say BTC is too dear, as no one knows how much a satoshi may be in the future.
And I’m not convinced that centralisation will happen.

That’s what we call shooting yourself in the foot, all that mining business has to do is relocate elsewhere, crypto is always profitable to mine.
Also they’re management are short sighted and narrow minded,  because it’s not about the fact that BTC mining will go on till 2140, but that it will carry on indefinitely due to TX verification and network effect.
This mining group should pull the plug move on, leaving this Norwegian utility company with less end of year profit IMO.
They’re  not the first power company to get greedy, or the first not to have a longer term profit view, they won’t be the last, but their loss will be some countries gain in the long term.

Probably not in the respect that you are referring (material wealth), but let’s take into consideration in all modernised countries, the wealth poor divide is vast and getting bigger, already in most westernised societies there is no more middle classes, this shows that the wealth growth really does only benefit a few.
If you were not talking on material wealth, then I’d say no to your question, because there has been more death and destruction since the Vietnam war than as a human I care to think of, and all created off the current monetary system.
What you need to analyse is what you would have lived like with a sound money system, you may not have false growth like you have now, that will come to an end, but you would be enriched in many other ways as society wouldn’t be breaking down like it is, and the earth wouldn’t be sending out warning signs.
False growth is pointless as it will burst sooner or later and you end up worse off than you were originally, due to the fact of using resources you may as well of not done.

@_date: 2018-11-29 06:57:26
We keep hearing all of this but it doesn’t mathematically make any sense, there are 21 million bitcoins by 20140, 1800 per day mined.
So if these people are buying up huge amounts on mass WTF are they getting it from?
Most hodlers have masses of it stored, then there’s the big wallets that are on show, and we know how much they hold, so there can’t be masses of investors buying large amounts “ITS BULLSHIT”, what has happened to supply and demand rules as you can’t have it both ways.
Even if OTC trades don’t show up and reflect price rises, sooner or later they must because there won’t be enough BTC, in basic terms that means the price must sky rocket.
Some one is full of BS, and we are sucking it up seems to me.
Seems realist to say there are masses of BTC available at present with very few takers, as the price is at record lows, there’s no way on price evidence that they’re buying.

They have made seizures earlier in the year, it was only 500 BTC, how they seized it I don’t know, but it did say they were using z cash, but i believe from what I’ve read it’s more about the centralised exchanges and not the Blockchain, they can target transactions it seems because the exchanges daren’t not comply.

Wrong wrong wrong, firstly *debt* allowed that growth, it’s false growth because yes you guessed it, it created more debt.
Why is this true well, you state the paper fiat is backed by the goods it produces (GDP) when this isn’t correct because the Gross domestic product of say the united states falls well short of the amount of fiat needed to run society there and pay the interest on the debts they’ve created via inflation.
So no fiat doesn’t represent that product and nor does produce = fiat.
Not really following your gold and silver are worthless if there is nothing to buy, as there is always something to buy and by nature gold and silver are a global store of value and good ones, where as the fiat in your pocket is worth less year on year.

I would agree, supply and demand always tells the truth, but I do think that the manipulation can make things not so clear.

I thought price stabilisation came with liquidity or higher prices, since OTC doesn’t effect the price up, and also there are already many OTC sales aren’t we getting to the stage where the price will keep being stagnant because of more and more OTC sales.
If they’re rich make them buy on exchange and push the price higher in real time, God knows BTC needs a boost.
There was estimates done that BTC tokens would need to be 280k (thousand) each before stability was gained, how does OTC help that?.
Plus also if OTC is so good for BTC, I mean people buying large amounts, surely with all of this going down how come we are not seeing demand outstrip supply?
We clearly cannot be seeing the former or the price would be sky rocketing, in fact we are seeing more sold than bought, it don’t make sense.

Oh I see, am I write in thinking then if that is the case, that because BTC is the underlying asset used to determine who wins and who loses, wouldn’t owning the BTC directly and selling out or buying in do the same thing as owning an ETF?
I get that the ETF is designed for people who don’t want to own BTC directly, I just want to know if my train of thought is correct?.
Also if this is the case how do ETFs make an impact in price rise for BTC or other crypto coins, if the gains aren’t settled in BTC or other, I’m thinking supply and demand?.

Having faith in BTC is becoming a losers game, holding coins that don’t increase in value or only by as much as they’ll allow, while they make massive profit from their fake paper BTC contracts.
You have to hand it to them, because they’ve found away to own BTC, no matter what anyone thinks.

Question, what does mining empty block achieve in simple terms?
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:44:07
Yes I’ve been thinking about that and can see it now, do you know why mining empty blocks disrupts the other coin or chain?
As I understand it this is a kind of war between BCH and Bitcoin SV, but because the miners are having to choose or support one or the other, they the miners are taking hashing power away from BTC making BTC TX slower and BTC chain less stable for the time of the fork.
Which in effect is hurting the BTC price because traders may sell off and wait out and see how low and what the price consequences are.
Is this your take on the situation, or am I wrong.
@_date: 2018-11-24 05:07:41

Well if those mining farms aren’t profitable they will have to let the algorithm adjust down, in theory there is no reason why you can’t go back to home mining.
Of course you’d need hell of a lot of people to participate to make the network secure, or secure as it is now, but IMO there will always be people ready to mine if BTC has value.

These futures are settled in cash and not BTC, all this basically does is suppress demand for BTC, which will lower the price of said BTC.
They are basically selling paper BTC futures contracts and settling with cash.
Think about it, they don’t need BTC, hardware wallet, private keys or any kind of insurance, it’s corrupt but genius enough to cap the BTC price for as long as they like.
It’s like buying gold and getting only a piece of paper to say you own gold, when you come to sell the gold you get dollar price, not the physical shiny stuff, they can then sell as many paper contracts as they like and lower the gold price.
If they had to give each client physical gold they would cause supply issues because you can only mine so much per year, so the price would go higher and higher through demand.
BTC likely would have achieved this prior to xmas 2017 if these people hadn’t manipulated via these futures contracts.
Plus I think this guys post is spot on, as so many people on reddit have not come up with real evidence to say why the BTC price crashed, and more over why it’s been suppressed for the last 12 months.

If someone can show this info, and take in to consideration all the BTC held in other wallet, and miner supply per day, and show that this so called huge volume is being bought I’ll believe it.
But I know they can’t, because the maths doesn’t work, even basic supply demand maths says there is something not quite right about these statements.

Bitcoins in the U.K. are just over £3k, they’re peanuts for big money investors, one of the reasons these people haven’t invested yet is BTC has been the Wild West of finance.
Enter BAKKT and these people are more likely to invest, they’ll already know it has use case, if not now in the future, they have money to burn, hold on to your hat, because your going to be shocked how much BTC price will increase.

Hahaha, isn’t that a contradiction of the fact, you’re words *i know one point of Bitcoin and crypto is to get away from banks*, then you believe in the future their will be banks that hold your BTC.
The whole point of crypto is to own your own key and leave your tokens on the Blockchain, they’re safe as long as your keys safe, *your key, your coins*.
But he’s right, your right, it is hard.
HW wallets are all that’s needed in my view, and more eduction from the likes of Andreas and other computer geeks, they know the dangers more than laymen.
But he’s right when he says, any exchange that hasn’t been hacked, will in time unless things change.

Wrong bitcoin didn’t fail as a payment on tor, in fact most people who used it to make payment found it effective and they received their goods, that’s not failure, also Silk Road wasn’t taken down because the FBI traced bitcoin to dred pirate Roberts, “do your homework.”
As for no use cases, BTC is being used daily, there are also many future use cases for BTC that are ahead of their time.
Debating such issues with fools isn’t my game, I’d suggest you watch some Andreas talks, and maybe read a few books.
Here is a link so you can start your education now, it’s about silk roads inventor and how he got caught, and he didn’t get caught as you may think through” BITCOINS”, if it was so easy to catch someone through bitcoin payments, why then brainiac didn’t they use that avenue?

That’s probably because most of them are on slave wages and have debt and high living expenses.
Most people in the U.K. live wage to wage packet , and even those that don’t, most wouldn’t last more than 4 months living on their savings.

You’re correct from this article it’s clear, also haven’t you like me and many more thought over the last year there is something not quite right about the price of BTC, no one can give clear answers, it’s meant to be being adopted, there are large buy orders on exchange and people buying OTC, yet nothing on the price.
Seems clear they’re in complete control of the market price using this printing technique, it’s not Whales wallets like some people apply, in fact most whale wallets are inactive.
They’ve basically got round the hodlers technique by printing their own BTC, this is clearly why there is no demand issues, because they don’t settle with physical BTC.
Good luck suing them, they’ll have it all legal beagle I think, before they moved.

They’re falling because they always were over inflated, they’re out of kilter with wages and that’s always a warning sign.
Foreign money and most of it dirty money is what props up London prices and the fact that foreign investors are causing a supply problem by buying up all the properties for rental.
In the U.K. the government likes high house prices, as no1 its the easiest way to control population growth, and it brings in more stamp duty tax.
No ones a winner as all prices go up in parity, unless you down size or move to a cheaper area.
House prices should collapse and I’d personally love to see it, it’s never never money as you’ll always need a home and place to live.

High risk, high reward if it pays off.
Wouldn’t say he’s stupid at all, some individuals have the balls and belief to take huge risks, no one will say he’s a loser if BTC hits the big bucks.

Colonialism is exploitation of another race or their land, just like the white Americans stole the land they call their own now from the Indians.
Just like the British empire colonised many countries around the world, so the irony for the un-educated racist out there is that because you’re banging on about immigrants with marches and silly comments, you little realise that these people are only doing what white people have done for centuries.
But I get it the narrow minded though that because we are white we are superior and it’s ok for us to do what we like, but if you’re of a different race, belief, or colour you can’t.
Does that put it clearly into perspective for you.

That’s pretty much true, but the biggest irony of crypto haters, is that they’ll still get up on a Monday morning and head off to their low paid jobs 6 days a week. 
And you can be sure they don’t consider that a scam, yet their bosses are laughing their asses of that they have such a large pool of slaves to call on.
I know this is true as I met this arse hole on a job I was working on pre xmas 2018, well it was October, told him to speculate on BTC and put a £1000 in, any way he didn’t as he thought it’s a scam, I went onto show him it wasn’t and there is money to be made, I invested £1000 and before Xmas I took a profit out of £5000 and showed him just what he could have have, I’m sure he felt STUPID at that moment.
Then I explained if the price does go down you can buy up more BTC at a lower price, eventually you’ve got free BTC because you’ve taken profit and the money you’ve originally invested out.
BTC isn’t a scam I just believe most people are either dumb or ignorant, like the guy above, but hey ho those people will be using it in the future and they’ll not even KNOW so the argument against BTC is void.
It’s not people who buy BTC that are sheep, sheep is the general public as they led by their masters.

Your optimistic that the BTC supply is being raised indefinitely via paper manipulation, meaning any institutions or investors don’t need to touch physical BTC, meaning they make profit still, and suppress the real BTC price?
You’re also optimistic are you that because they’ve seen BTC as I direct threat to the dollar, that they’ve found away to own it and keep it where they want it, and it’s price?.
I don’t see anything cheery about this post, because everything about it shows bitcoin has failed to do what it was meant to, and that’s decentralisation.

I mean financially if they are going to be listed on two exchanges, sounds like free money.

Why don’t you get a decent accountant, I spoke to my accountant about BTC but he didn’t know much, but he said to me you should be able to offset any loses against profits, and also on reddit recently I read a post where a UK solicitor or legal representative had found a loophole in the law, which stated that because BTC is electronic money, it’s can’t be classed as property, because you don’t really own it.
If that’s true then HMRC can’t tax you on a capitol gains basis, they would have to accept it as currency, so if that was the case no tax would be liable.

@_date: 2018-11-06 05:20:57
Probably not no, you would need another device (new one), then all you would have to do it enter your 24 word seed phrase and your coins would be back.
It’s the seed words that are important not the device, you can have as many as you like, but lose your seed words and you have no access then to your coins.
All wallets have a back up, some are only 12 words, the reason is if you lost your mobile phone with an app wallet on it, you’d need it back in most circumstances , so same again buy a new phone, re load wallet app, and enter master seeds to get original wallet back.
DO NOT BUY A CHEAP ONE OR A USED ONE, only buy from LEDGER, and only accept one in a sealed box that has not been tampered with.
The only thing a hard wallet does is store your PRIVATE KEY on a special chip, that is in a secure off line environment, YOUR COINS, are in a wallet linked to the private key and they stay on the Blockchain, which is the most secure place of all.
When you connect your device to the computer via an app and a USB cable, your wallet on the Blockchain syncs with the device via the private key stored on the device, so when synced you can see your balance and send and receive crypto payments.
I’m afraid it’s as secure as it gets and I’m afraid we all have to be responsible for our pass phrase words.
The best place is a safe deposit box at a bank, personally I would use two banks and two safe deposit boxes for peace of mind, remember you only ever need them if the device is destroyed, lost, or stolen, oh and the latter isn’t a problem as you set a pass code on the device when you set it up, so the thief would need to know this passcode, three wrong attempts and the device wipes it’s self.
@_date: 2018-11-05 13:55:50
That’s a decision only you can make, but a hardware wallet like ledger and be responsible for the 24 master seed words, at least you know they are your coins.

Ok, I’m not convinced still, also I don’t buy the bank analogy, what use is BTC to banks?
imo nothing, BTC does nothing for them, plus if that was the case, then IMO BTC would be finished because with their great wealth they could crash it down to zero by dumping all of their stored BTC on the market, regardless of losses as they hate BTC and would love to see it go away.
Thing is reddit has all these posts, yet no evidence.

You see the whole point in society is not to have a society which benefits only the wealthy, as this one does, it’s a deeper conversation that I don’t want to have right now, based on growth = a better standard of living, or growth decimating society and the planet, based on that is growth the key, well I believe it can’t be as sooner or later any wealth created will be swallowed up on infrastructure repairs caused via global warming and a changing climate, growth isn’t the be all and end all.
I think personally that crypto being sound money is a better system as it promotes saving and responsibility, I guess when trump asks his adviser about money and his adviser says we need more, trump will say do what ever it takes, this debt  cycle doesn’t go away.
In fact the united stated created 1 trillion more in debt each year, do you call that growth, I call that suicide.
If you’re not putting up taxes you aren’t getting more money in the coffers, and based on a lot of countries GDP even if they increase tax they still fall short of their yearly out goings (GROWTH ��).

But what I said originally, I still stand by, take profits when BTC rises, and buy back when the price drops, all you need is patience.
BTC price is only going one way long term IMO and that’s up and up, suppressing prices so you can buy more BTC is good business, and yes you’ll need to be a big holder to have that influence, but there will come a time soon where the BTC price will be let run, and anyone who’s not invested soon will be FOMO.
One of the reasons shit coin exist is the people buying them are looking for cheap entry level crypto, obviously they won’t be around long, but the irony is because BTC is so divisible they’d have been better placing their funds into BTC from the start, I also agree with general consensus that 97% of the coins around today will die soon, and all that money will come into BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:21:08
Firstly the BTC price has large volatility, that volatility means it’s ideal for trading.
So even if it’s a bear market as long as you buy low and sell higher after stoppages (tax, fees ect) you have made profit.
Each trade will be unique, so some you’ll win some you won’t, obviously a bull market will make it easier but there will be gains now, some people will be trading hundreds of thousands.
I neither know US tax law as I’m not from the states, but I know your tax will be due by a certain date and traders sell off some of their holdings, to cover the costs.
Yes of course loses can be claimed against gains, and not all trades will be profitable, but over all they’ll make money, that’s what they do.
@_date: 2018-11-11 12:16:18
Explain why it’s a wonderful thing, explain why having your wealth eroded through inflation is a wonderful thing, or any other reasons you think paper fiat is superior to BTC.
Or read this and realise from it that inflation and fiat are not wonderful, they = death and destruction, as wars can’t be fought through tax payments alone as those taxes won’t cover the costs.
In basic terms lots of good people die for silly causes due to this (read).

Problem with selling is always when these sell offs happen, crypto moves many time the bottom value, when the bull run starts.
Meaning unless those profits taken aren’t absolutely necessary, those people often look back and see how much they threw away by selling, especially the panic seller.
Most of the biggest winners are going to be those who constantly buy the dips and won’t sell until the big bucks IMO.
But it does take balls of steel, when there’s blood on the streets.
Or those people will become huge losers, that’s the gamble “high risk, high reward, low risk, low reward”.

I’m not saying the earth is made entirely of gold, I’m telling you a fact about so called finite resources, they’re manipulated for profit, facts are global mining corporations can mine tonnes more gold if they choose, you work out why they don’t but don’t be fooled.
The same applies for oil, if you want oil prices high you cut production, you want them low you increase it.
Next you’ll be saying diamonds are rare ��.
BTC is limited to 21 million that is core BTC not other, please work out which is rarer, this should be valued higher.

I can’t see bitcoin SV surviving long, those price above are just after the fork. It will be sold off on mass over the next few weeks and it’s price will be pennies.
I remember Litecoin Cash fork, and now that’s worth pennies, think the facts are none of these shitcoins are really supported like BTC, and BTC hence again has shown resilience to these forks.
These shitcoins will die as they won’t get the support or money invested to send them forward.
Just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-11-30 07:15:00
Sell your bitcoins, because like the article says, they’re not needed, there will be no demand issues for physical BTC, and the BTC price will probably go well lower when people wake up to this manipulation and sell out.
Crypto is dead on this news.
And of course everyone once said BTC is incorruptible, that now is the biggest joke this century.
@_date: 2018-11-08 06:00:17
This is where it falls down for me as I know nothing about trading, I’d get eaten haha, that was my thinking to dump the new coins and re invest the gains into BTC, increasing my BTC stocks.
It’s the coin swapping taxable event stuff that worries me most as if a BITCOIN has a 20% tax cost, then a £5000 BITCOIN swapped for BCASH would incur a £1000 tax bill for me as soon as I did the swap.
That would mean that the 10.5 forked coins id get free would have to be worth considerably more than £1000 for me to pay the tax and make a decent profit.
Hope I’m making sense.

3)buy orders (well yeah ��)
4)BTC is sound money, sure there manipulation, in time that will be dealt with that’s why BAKKT are coming in, that’s also why there is SEC, financial stability comes from more liquidity (higher prices) that takes time, all currency is volatile in the beginning, BTC is more than money but still only 10 years old, you work it out.
5)people who sell at a loss are fucking stupid, and shouldn’t be in the market, you should never sell at a loss, instead be patient, don’t listen to FUD spreaders or amateur economists on reddit.
6) and technological advances are and have already been added to the Blockchain, more are already coded and ready for deployment, 2019 is a big year for BTC, cleaver people are buying, mugs are bitching.

It’s a fake for sure, and has been made one by the same institutions it was meant to circumnavigate.
It’s hilarious.
You can’t print bitcoins ehhh, well they always find away to use their printing presses to go work.
And clearly this is all a ploy to keep supply of physical BTC in check, meaning the price won’t rise, they’ll make profit, but BTC won’t have any supply and demand issues, because they’re not buying physical BTC, they’re printing them.

@_date: 2018-11-30 06:08:45
Exactly the point, bitcoins meant to be seamless unstoppable, anonymous ect.
What do these idiots on this post think will happen if the Iranians are using BTC payments to built nuclear weapons so they can attack their neighbours?.
The point is sanctions on countries that are threats must be effective if they’re not the worlds in trouble.
So here’s the deluded deal of most people on here, the US can’t do anything and BTC will always win, wrong they can clamp it with a vice, shut all exchanges, make it outlawed and illegal to interact in, make banks not process payments for individuals and exchanges.
Wait now and pause already the effects of such news, ahhh the BTC price it tanking down, looking at the charts, even the hard line hodlers are lining up on the cliff getting ready to jump (sell) like lemmings, this is what the effects would be, loss of confidence and  a government that won’t take anymore.
Sure these people will say you can’t shut BTC down, but the G20 can collude under severe circumstances like sanction avoidance, and globally make mining facilities shut down with immediate effect.
Once there is no confidence, no investor would participate or risk their money, no individual would believe this technology incorruptible.
Facts are the global policing authorities won’t let money laundering and criminal activity thrive, I’ve put links on here for people to check showing how many BTC the United States and others have confiscated.
Forget the BS my keys my coins for a moment, and remember you’ll spit pass words and private keys if threatened with an extended prison Holliday for sure.
So all in all no  one knows just how far the US government may go if they believe they’re being laughed at, my advise from this article is be wary, as it’s not all about the two addresses it’s more about what they may do if they need to rebalance authority.

It depends which country you’re in?
If you’re in the uk, they can’t make you destitute, if you use your vehicle for work and depend upon it, they cannot take it away from you either.
The money you owe on the credit cards probably didn’t exist in the first place as they also rely on a form of fractional reserve lending system, so morally you buying BTC and either saying you’ve lost the private key, or spent the coins is no different to them letting you get so deep in debt.
There was a court case in the USA when a guy took the credit card company to court, stating that he owed them nothing as originally they had not the money to lend, now we know this is true, but you can’t win in court neither did he, as the implications for these corrupt institutions is to great.
Morally you’re doing nothing they don’t do, whether it’s immoral or not.
Go for it, good luck, don’t have credit cards is the moral of this story.

I know that but your missing the point.
Firstly you can have as many verifiable BTC as you like, but as this post shows the price of those BTC are manipulated in this case via paper issued BTC.
That means in simple terms they’re in control of the BTC price and they don’t even need to own it.
If you can’t see how destructive that is to Bitcoin you’re a fool, because, BTC is reliant now on how high price wise they’re willing to let it go.
Thinking that institutional money would bring big bucks to BTC seems untrue, as they’re not interested in inflating it’s price to those levels, that will either hurt the average public investor or fiat currencies.
Saying bitcoin can do this or that is irrelevant if it has little value, the only reason people are here is because of what they may make, where the institutions and their investors are taking the cash in.

It’s been done, but the court ruled in favour of the bank (credit card company), I think it was a bank, he claimed they had no money to lend for a mortgage he took out.
So when the bank wanted to reposes his home, he claimed they couldn’t because originally they had no money to lend, because all cash is created through accounting procedures or fractional reserve banking.
He lost in court, even though he was right, they’ll never open the flood gates in cases like these.

Surely by 2140 the idea would be, that miners would make way more than they are now in fees,  because by then BTC could be the global payment system.
There are only a few million at most using it now, if you think billions, then the miners have incentive and bigger pay days than now.
That doesn’t mean fees would be higher, as the fees would be more numerous.

Yes I think that is what’s happening, another post I’ve just read mentions, if hash power is taken away from BTC in effect BTC becomes less stable and slower, I think the Bcash hash war is taken BTC hash power and using it in this civil war.
For this reason I see the sell off, but I just poised the question on there, does it mean when this BCH fiasco is over and the miners put the hash power back onto Bitcoin, logically the price should rise back up to pre BCASH fork prices.
What’s your view?.

Now anyone who believes you can join the BNP and not know what they are about, with their ties to groups also like combat 18 and the national front must be pretty stupid right.
Well Robinson isn’t stupid so he clearly new he was in a white power group, it’s usually people with below 40 IQ that follow him, take a look at his marches and the chav following, these aren’t middle England suburbia people, they’re deluded un-educated council house dwellers who stereo typically wear stone island clothing, keep a Staffordshire terrier or fighting dog and go to the football on a Saturday.

I think BTC is being allowed to be regulated so the higher rewards can come by letting in investors.
But it’s not being helped to become decentralised if those individuals are not keeping their own private keys themselves, letting Bakkt or and exchange be in control of your key is centralisation, and Bakkt will be another honey pot that eventually they’ll get hacked as they’ve stated they’ll settle contracts in physical BTC tokens.
Problem they have (governments) is they can’t ban it or control it, and when it goes more decentralised they’ll have less power.
Yes it’s interesting times.

Fiat isn’t very divisible, compared to the 100 million divisible places of a Bitcoin, BTC can also serve for internet micro payments, normal money cannot.
Fiat currency is meant by design and government policy to devalue each year, this is why they set an inflation rate, this Spurs people to spend and not save as their savings are worth less year on year.
BTC is the opposite your savings will increase in time.
Cash fiat is dirty, labour intensive, has to be counted,  stored, it’s a vector for thief’s like bank robbers, it’s the best tax avoidance tool on the planet, and also most narcotic payments are processed in cash.
BTC is traceable and recorded, there is a trail, unlike cash.
There are many debt ridden countries in the world, the only way they can function is to create more money and add to their never ending debt pile, these are facts and sooner or later they’ll fall, taking down most of the populous with them.
BTC is the first incorruptible sound money ever, ignore the rest of the shit coin pack, BTC is the real deal.
@_date: 2018-11-13 06:15:15
Let’s put this into perspective, you’re not going to get a lot of these people buying BTC because they either won’t have spare money, they are not risk takers, they don’t understand it, or they’re lazy.
Just read an article about 7000 people still watching black and white TV (FGS), so I think BTC has a long way to go before it’s main stream.
But BTC doesn’t really need all of those people, it’s doing just fine without them.

I have missed the boat in BCASH price gains there is no doubt, but I didn’t know about the fork as Bcash doesn’t interest me.
I can see that buying it a few weeks ago maybe would have given profit, but always for me the problem is cashing out BTC for other coins and causing a taxable event, not knowing whether you’ll be out of pocket or that it’s worth the risk and time.
So as some have said on here that in their opinion it’s not worth it for certain reasons, I am not going to buy any, but o will monitor the price and fork out of pure interest to see how things work.
As for BTC I’m sold and always have been, I do believe there are cleaver people who will make it work out there, it’s a risk I will take and I do buy BTC as regular as I can afford.
Trading I know little about, so I’m not ready for that yet, but I would like to dabble in the future after more guidance.

When you invest money, cleaver investors take out their initial outlay once prices rise up, taking profit.
Once you’ve taken out your initial outlay, in this case BTC you are then into free money or free BTC, in this scenario which all investors should follow, if the price goes to zero you don’t loose anything.
So yes if you can see it, it’s free BTC and profit.
As I said I clearly could see prior to this point you are clueless about investing or potential opportunity, I could go further and educate you how to make money even when there is blood on the streets but it would be wasted on a non believer��.

@_date: 2018-12-01 07:51:17
You may be talking about physical bitcoin, you’re clearly not understanding the impact the CME futures are having on those physical bitcoins and their price.
The more they create and put into circulation the more BTCs exist albeit not all physical, but never the less extremely damaging for bitcoins and their price.
Just like the gold markets they can print as much paper gold as they like and again either lower or suppress the price.
Same thing, same deal, that’s why you have a lowly BTC price because they’re dictating it,
In fact CME futures contracts finished yesterday, last Friday of the month, as like most other times there is a solid BTC price decrease.
Try thinking about a contradiction in terms, there can only be 21 million physical BTC, but institutions don’t need them or their investors, oh and they can increase the supply via paper BTC.
Not really 21 million when you now think about it.
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:58:49
I agree with what you’re saying in general, I know there is a huge difference between the two (BTC paper contracts and BTC the digital coin) but considering BTC wasn’t meant to be corrupt-able it sure seems to me like it has been and is.

Well the first paragraph is talk for the sake of talk, and I’m my opinion drivel, children learn far easier about fiat money basics than they do BTC.
And what crap about volatility, you’ll find 15% inflation is controllable, in the U.K. in the 1970s Interest rates were 17%, higher then the the 15% you quote, any self denier into BTC always try’s to cover its ridiculous volatility up with lame excuses, instead of admitting that is not useful other than for speculation.
And more rubbish about how bitcoin is only young and needs time to be able to do all the things it can’t do now and never  could.
Also it’s losing its battle in the regulatory sense because each piece or regulation is making it more centralised when it’s meant to be decentralised, and if you haven’t noticed,  if the regulators pass a law bitcoin world does what it’s told, it’s such a joke ��, if you don’t deny it, or can see it.
Plus LN has been promising for a long while, it’s major flaw is people don’t spend BTC they hoard it, why is LN a game changer, then you talk of killer apps that may or may not come.
All in all your reply has no substance, BTC price is manipulated via wall st and paper futures contracts, it’s value only holds up through hodling and speculation.
Period as there is no productive element to it, plus it pays no dividend for an investor.
It’s a joke.

You said you already knew they had been refused, through your funky website you keep spouting about.
To reiterate I said I don’t think they will on the evidence and what granting such a thing would do for the BTC price.
You are the one that stated they have been refused, sure you’ve not proven this but I don’t care, as I know of the evidence about BTC paper futures it’s unlikely.

Can’t be inflated, what about all the paper BTC IOUs that CME bitcoin futures bring to the table?
Whether they are physical or not they are inflating supply and lowering real demand for the real BTC tokens as they’re cash settled.
So yes they can inflate supply, just like in fiat and just like in gold.
Plus the post is utter crap, if said whales were buying huge amounts supply and demand would have kicked in by now and BTC price would be high.
Bit-coiners lie about this buying up of BTC by saying it’s all OTC so won’t show up, if it doesn’t show up and they can’t show the wallets these huge amounts of BTC are being moved to its clearly lies.
Lies to keep people interested that the low price tide will change soon, and don’t sell your coins.
Because we know holding is the only thing that supports the BTC price from total collapse.
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:46:29
If it’s neutral to demand for BTC then it will have the same lowering effect on the price.
It’s simple supply and demand, what they are doing by not settling in BTC (rather settling future contracts in cash) is to suppress demand, hence they lower price and can even crash the market by the amount of futures contracts they make available.
Note: Andreas Antonopoulos did say these futures contracts and ETFS isn’t what BTC is about and they will be more detrimental to BTC than not having them
(I see his point now) probably he knew these contracts would be cash settled.
The only way BTC price rises is demand, because supply is low, they are and still are manipulating this via paper BTC.
Bakkt say  their futures contracts are BTC settled, some say it’s lies as the price will sky rocket if Bakkt settle in BTC, this high price will become a threat to the dollar or may do and government will act.
Especially because FOMO will again kick in and people in the public arena who buy in will eventually become burnt again when they crash the price again, it’s common sense to see they don’t want the dollars hold challenging. 
Remember also Bakkt haven’t had the SECs approval for physically backed futures, IMOA they won’t get approval either and they will sell the same shit storm deals the CEM are doing.

Ummmm��, they effect the supply because the CME aren’t settling with physical BTC this effects demand in the wrong way and gives them a tool to manipulate the price, they’re already doing it.
If BTC futures contracts are settled in physical BTC it means they’ll have to buy them, thus reducing supply and increasing demand and price.
They know as long as they use the paper substitute they won’t let the BTC price sky rocket, but they’ll still feed of profit.
Sucker hodlers just help them achieve their goal.
You can hold for ever, but they’re manipulating the price down.

That’s not how limited token currencies work, if you can’t create more and there is a disaster for instance that needs a cash injection to help the people or country sort that disaster, BTC would be a terrible source of funds, there would be none in reserve to help.
This isn’t debatable, every economist on earth has pointed out this flaw from day one, even Andreas Antonopoulos admits he’s not an economist or knows the real outcome of a BTC based economy.

The whole point everyone seems to miss is, apart from owners of Bitcoins and people on reddit who spread the word like a religious cult, “NO ONE ELSE “can be arsed to learn about it.
When people start using money they don’t generally have to learn a technology book on the subject, what they do is get money (paper fiat) and spent it, this system is so simple thats why it’s so successful.
If you talk to anyone who owns BTC they make out this system is better, easier, and more secure, all of which are proven not to be true, because if this was fact people wouldn’t need educating.
patronising people with this education crap about how bitcoins  works and why it’s better, how it’s going to change people’s life’s is in fact why most people shut off at the mention of it.
After 5 minutes of hearing someone drone on most people are making excuses to leave the room.
Plus it’s price is just so volatile, that no one into crypto knows whether it’s Zero tomorrow of stagnant, but every holdler talks of mythical MOON, this is utter crap because we know Wall Street dictate the price, only bitcoiners are to dumb to see it and dumber not to admit it.

Still a 10 minute block reward so it’s just the same, easier is misleading.
If it was easier you’d mine them faster which isn’t possible, bullshit post.

The real dollar supply is unchanged since they came of the gold standard then also, even though they’ve created trillion of fake ones.
Sorry that doesn’t wash with me, as it is or it isn’t, it can’t be both, they are creating fake paper BTC with devastating effect, watering down the original supply is the aim and it’s working.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:58:38

Why will you win, they don’t need to buy BTC, they’re printing paper copies of BTC to use in futures trading.
Plus they can print as much as they like. This means in simple terms they don’t effect the supply of BTC and price rise.
They’ve been shown to have manipulated the 2017 crash and subdued the price all year, while still getting richer and fatter.
They are in control, and taming BTC for sure, and no one can stop them.
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:08:23
You didn’t even know the CME were directly crashing BTC prices, and you’re getting paid in BTC, that’s not a wise investor in my eyes.
Yeah come back in, that’s a cop out meaning it’s shit and can’t do anything because it’s manipulated and out of your control.
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:13:37
It won’t be settled in BTC, they’re not going to let bitcoins price run away, as it would of this was granted.
Bitcoin futures payed in cash is all they need to make money, note I said they.
The hodlers just hold the price up slightly within this ecosystem, they control the overall price via paper BTC contracts.
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:38:25
I clearly understand the technology, I also clearly see that’s its price is corrupt-able by external forces, that’s hardly ground breaking, and hardly offers people that buy in security.
Hacking on about what it can do in the future that it can’t do now is a lame excuse that cries out I’m failing.
Good god even Andreas Antonopoulos said bitcoin ETFs would be hurtful to BTC, and he’s bitcoin god.
Really stop making excuses look at the evidence and see, they’re winning the war.

@_date: 2018-12-02 06:29:19
They’re getting involved to cap the price of physical BTC, they themselves don’t need to own or buy BTC to make money of its reputation.
But what they are doing is stopping it going mainstream and becoming a threat.
Supply and demand, if the price isn’t rising there isn’t the demand, or something is stopping the demand rise.

@_date: 2018-12-04 05:37:30
CASH SETTLED, expect the BTC price to be sub $1000 dollars soon, with all these cash settled products they’ll just keep driving the price and demand down.
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:14:07
But considering the United States can’t go bankrupt that won’t make any difference.
Plus if you knew anything about economics you’d realise the the US economy overall is in good shape, they’re owed globally virtually as much in payments as they have debt on their books.
Debt in an economy is part and parcel of the structure and managing it by different means and tools is the game.
You most certainly would be bankrupt and in trouble soon enough, in a non spending BTC deflationary economy.

No body said they’re not third party, I said I think now probably for the 5th time they’re vulnerable for attack.
I can show you many instances also of people private keys being being got hold of in one way or another.
You shouldn’t be so cocky either about your private key because it only takes one mistake and you are the perfect candidate to make such a mistake because you think you’re cleaver than you are.
Anyone can spout Andreas Antonopoulos videos and make out they are a computer scientist buy the truth is in the detail and I clearly see via you knowledge you are not.

No chance and if it is it will be more cash settled futures contracts no physical bitcoin.
Expect more real bitcoin price losses.
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:34:13
No it doesn’t, it bypasses demand because you’re not settling with bitcoin.
Please read supply and demand, cash settled contracts don’t create demand ��, in fact it’s tantamount to creating paper bitcoin and in essence increasing supply without even touching a real bitcoin or the Blockchain.
That’s why the price is low, manipulation.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:19:02
OH PLEASE *what a prick* maybe one day you’ll have a whole buttcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-02 08:46:28
The reason why all this is just more crap to get you to buy more BTC, is mathematics, over and over and over we hear all these people buying all this BTC and there is only “21 million right.”
So it cannot be possible not to effect the supply chain, in fact it’s so impossible that every article like this you should if you have any sense dismiss.
You would have dried up OTC supplies by now, you would have depleted any stored BTC that miners may have had, and you would have pushed the price up via supply and demand metrics.
@_date: 2018-12-04 11:39:40
Haha that’s so true, guy who posted this is a dick, says he gets paid in bitcoin, that says it all ������.
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:46:16
Yes seriously, go read the white paper and tell me this isn’t a contradiction of the facts about what BTC is.
For example bitcoiners always say about inflated US dollars or other fiat, yet via this transmission route, the CME are now inflating the BTC supply, if you don’t think this kind of devaluation is totally the same, then that’s your view.
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:39:34
Yes I know, talk talk about miners selling to OTC counters, where then is the supply and demand issues if so many have been sold.
It’s all lies that’s why.
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:23:31
So how many lessons is that I’ve given you today, how your education has come on, soon you’ll know about crypto currency.
Well, let’s start with the basics first I know how slow you are on the uptake �� ��‍♂️.
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:24:01
Well there you go by your own admission and via what is previously said the public and business have no appetite for being hacked.
Can’t understand why you argued differently in the first instant, you should have clearly seen that this is a flaw to adoption and agreed.
See how I’m teaching you now.
@_date: 2018-12-03 07:50:34
Yet again I see you can’t read.
I said I can show you examples where people’s private keys have been exposed online and hackers have used those keys to transfer their dingle berry coins.
Please keep up.
@_date: 2018-12-02 07:08:44
Only an idiot would have all their money in crypto.
@_date: 2018-12-01 08:39:18
You can see it how you like, I’m just pointing out the facts about paper BTC futures.
My honest opinion is i think more corporate institutions will cripple bitcoin, they’ll compartmentalise it, make it their own because they have the means the government support and the know how.
Keeping wealth in wallets that’s not appreciating because the promises aren’t coming true is a mugs game, you could be making money elsewhere with that money.
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:52:44
Ring fenced projects aren’t revolutions, that’s what BTC is, that’s what governments do “RING FENCE “them until it’s theirs.
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:56:30
I’m literally trying to do you a favour with some advice, that advise is sell your bitcoins, because I can see you have limited knowledge of how an economy works, you’ve limited knowledge of how money works and for that matter what money really is.
On the tech side also you seem to be late coming to the table or haven’t kept up with the news, which is lethal seen that you are investing in that tech.
All in all you seem like a supermarket checkout boy, that’s wasting his money and time.
Sell before you lose more of your money.
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:06:05
Mining blocks every 40 minutes doesn’t matter and high fees I suppose don’t matter.
This guys a nut job, he needs to go back and listen to the moaning people did when TX on the BTC chain were slow and high cost.
It’s a virtual failure in those circumstances.
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:54:51
What utter crap, you‘re invested in bitcoin and you’ve not got a clue how the price works.
Paper bitcoin futures settled in cash, cause the BTC market not to have demand LOL because their settled in cash.
Transaction volume causes price increase, no it doesn’t, demand increases price and price increases TX volume.
Why don’t you look and see how many TX at 17000 dollars compared to now FFS.
And if your talking about TX increasing BTC price on the open Blockchain then you’re saying that “LN”  TXs wont add value obviously because they are off chain hahaha ����.
And the last bit of drivel you’ve sent is not worth my time, but just for you, no one is debating there are 21 million shit kicker coins, we all know that, what we’re say is that’s easily inflated via paper IOUs just like the Comex does in the gold market, this increases bitcoin supply and lowers its price.
It’s simple supply and demand, and institutions like CME certainly know how to influence the price.
They’ve been doing it all year, while little mugs like you have been looking for answers in the wrong places.
Never mind ��.
Please don’t msg back your not worthy to debate an issue with, you don’t even understand simple supply and demand.
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:55:09

They’ve already done it, the 2017 crash was all about CME futures contracts, go look at the charts, if you can’t see the decline line down to where we are today you need glasses.
And yes they can print as many as they like just like they can print as many gold IOUs as they like.
It’s pure government backed price manipulation period.
@_date: 2018-12-02 07:54:39
Bitcoin isn’t escaping the global banking cartel, because that banking cartel and Wall Street are manipulating it, either way people who believe BTC to be pure freedom are deluded.
BTC won’t bring freedom, because the money makers are taming it and controlling it.
BTC is all about making a profit, getting in and getting out at the right times.
It’s no different to any other investment on the planet.
Plus do you really think the global governmental system is going to let their currencies and their banks fall to a crypto token they have no means of regulating through lender of last resort.
Believe me it’s not ever going to happen, it’s a libertarian dream that’s utter nonsense.
A room full of libertarian ideas isn’t the global populous, and they untimely are the ones you’ll have to sell BTC to and at present they’re not buying in.

It just made me laugh.
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:40:30
What do you mean cop out, what is it your asking exactly?
You do know that Bakkt haven’t been granted a physical bitcoin settled futures contract, right, and the SEC are very unlikely to grant it.
You do know solid x and Gemini and all the others also have been denied the same physical BTC futures and ETF contracts, but told they can settle with cash right.
Now if you read the links I sent you retard, you’ll see why they only want BTC settles in cash FFS are you stupid.
It means that they aren’t willing to let the price rise or run away, it means they have a pretty good weapon at controlling these price rises, and that is through paper BTC contracts.
Please try to understand before you msg people as you look really stupid.
@_date: 2018-12-03 10:17:58
The express, yeah like anyone’s going to listen to anything that’s said in this paper.
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:40:48
Their are two kind, those that are real coins IE gold or silver, that have a redeemable QR code and value attached by either Cassius or the Titan mint.
Or there are those digital BTC that are connected to and stored on the open Blockchain.
None physical BTC or fake ones would be BTC (IOUs) connected to futures by the CME, or any other cash settled future or ETFs that don’t pay out in BITCOINS that are connected to the Blockchain.
The term physical directly means Blockchain linked, one of the 21 million limited supply.
So when someone says an ETF or a futures contract will be paid out in physical BTC it means they have to buy real BItcoin and settle these payment in real BTC and not cash.
At present they only pay out in cash, this is to stop the Bitcoin price rising, but at the same time still make a profit for themselves.
@_date: 2018-12-02 06:58:08
More people out there have stopped accepting BTC payments than are signing up, basically because there was either NO demand or little.
Can’t see how your going to get people paying with something that could be worth more tomorrow, doesn’t make sense as a currency.
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:10:47
Yep more buttcoin dreams.
@_date: 2018-12-02 10:35:00
Bitcoin wallets are hackable their vulnerable to malware, the Blockchain isn’t hackable but that’s irrelevant to the public as they have to store their coins somewhere and for everyday use that is a Mobile wallet.
My point is all you’ve said equates to nothing more than conjecture with no guarantee or substance.
Like most people into BTC they think they know more than they really do, only rarely do you speak to people with credible qualifications in computer science.
Oh and like you have clearly done and shown, you think people who only have an account on reddit that only shows a few weeks must be a newbie and know nothing of the technology or economics, which is blindingly narrow minded.
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:37:01
Price high is what triggers FOMO, people’s greed, as for Xmas 2017 but FOMO will only stand up a couple of times.
Meaning if BTC crashes again and again, no one in their right mind would touch it after so many people have been burnt.
@_date: 2018-12-02 10:02:24
It’s irrelevant if you take a close look, card payments didn’t ever go backwards they always increased.
BTC on the other hand has seen shop after shop shut down crypto related payments because no one was using it.
Comparing cards which are insured ect and have less complications, with bitcoins that’s volatile, hackable, and generally complicated tells you why it’s failing to catch on main stream.
Bitcoiners  deny this by using future arguments.
@_date: 2018-12-02 10:57:20
Well this is the whole point, as soon as a bitcoiners has no answers to any of the subjects the call you a troll and run for the door, not because your a troll but more they don’t want you making them look more foolish than they already look.
Yes bye.
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:32:52
That’s absolutely correct, Exchange’s and everyday wallets will always be vulnerable to hacks, this is one reason why the general public who aren’t tech savvy run a mile from anything crypto.
I mean we even have fake trezors now floating around, it gets worse IMO.
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:08:31
You believe that just because someone who has an account on reddit that’s a few weeks old, holds less BTC than someone who has a longer time account?.
If so do you know how preposterous that sounds, satoshi has nearly 1 million BTC, but probably doesn’t have an account on reddit.
If this is the the yardstick used to know or judge someone’s BTC holding or knowledge of the subject the I think that is a little silly do you.
Try to think before you speak.
May I also add I’m not new enough not to have seen first hand markets collapse and the perusing devastation, unlike the majority on here.
@_date: 2018-12-02 07:00:43
Well done, well pointed out.

Bitcoins can’t be hacked that’s what you said. Would you like more examples of hacks, I’ll send you all the links and the means by which the hackers gained access, not that you’d understand any of it as your clearly asking the most stupid question I’ve ever heard.

This is hilarious, miners finding times hard “RUBBISH” how can they be, every other post on here is saying how much OTC (over the counter) BTC they are selling to all the institutional billionaires.
�� yet they’re hard up having to scale back because the BTC price is tanking and they can’t afford the electric costs, sound like they’re not selling huge amounts of BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:00:17
Piece of advice, rats and sinking ships is the best analogy for a market decline.
1) the price tanks, but it tanks  lower than the believers thought it ever would.
2) the market is raped with panic, the hodlers have fear of being bag holders.
3) the wise or lucky dump their stock and exit.
4) the rest  lose all, as the exchanges stop letting people sell or withdraw.
5) by now the price is zero as all faith has gone, the miners are bust the system has fallen.
6) BTC becomes a thing of the past, governments usher in their own crypto.
The end.
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:56:34
They’ll not be settled in cash that’s for sure.
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:44:58
No the link I sent you shows a vulnerability that was in the BTC coding this was found by a guy, I forget his name now, but that vulnerability would have meant miners could have double spent on the Blockchain.
The definition of a hack as stated on Wikipedia is, “taking advantage of a flaw in the code of a system or network”, usually for financial gain and usually that is an illegal activity.
You’ll find that that is a vulnerability and if it had been used it would have been a hack, your view of what’s safe and what can’t be hacked Is ridiculous, because most hacks don’t seem possible until you read the news.
Bitcoin Blockchain has already could of been hacked the link shows this, anyone in BTC know this.
Wallets are hacked daily, through one means or another.
And as I stated originally before you went off track, the general populous won’t ever use BTC because they’re not stupid and don’t want hacking of their hard earn money.
@_date: 2018-12-02 10:40:29
Not at all because government taxes don’t cover economic costs, they never have, that’s why more money needs to be created to cover those costs and give citizens a reasonable standard of living.
Take a look at countries world wide who are already in a situation who can’t create more wealth and have little tax income, I certainly wouldn’t want to live there, as economists have pointed out its means you’ll be poorer.
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:09:44
Nobody mentioned 51% attacks, I sent you two links showing you the bitcoin Blockchain could of been hacked in the past, you’d said it couldn’t.
If you knew anything about BTC and it’s network you’d have known these facts without a link to guide you ��.
I reiterate for you, I said people don’t want bitcoin because it’s everyday wallets are vulnerable to hacks.
It s you that is a moron because you can’t read properly and you can’t take in information and make an informed decision, I’m afraid you’re a dunce and I don’t want to spend anymore time trying to educate you.

Oh well know your tiny brain may be able to join the dots, if you go back and read the link, if you can read, suck in the research the author has done.
You’ll realise what I’ve been telling you all along is correct, BTC price won’t rise, it’s manipulated and controlled by the CME.
@_date: 2018-12-01 07:52:51
Have you seen any ETFs other than cash settled approved? 
Van x, Gemini, no is the answer, just pointing out the obvious.
@_date: 2018-12-02 11:26:09
I’ve not mis quoted anyone, I’ve said more retails have stopped accepting BTC than are now accepting it, I said this did not happen with visa and debit cards.
BTC is going in circle sometimes it’s even going backward, and for the record I said hacks are a problem for BTC through wallets and apps and also exchanges.
You seem to think I mis quoted you when what I really did was put you right on stuff.
@_date: 2018-12-01 08:22:05
You’re not seeing it clearly, you’re IMO confusing your self with jibberish, because BTC for your information and all crypto is priced in fiat.
Bitcoins are by definition at the moment in time worthless without the fiat link.
Yes your correct that people can buy lower, except how do you know how low it will go or how long you’ll be holding something that doesn’t have any real price movement.
Take a look at gold, it’s static price puts off speculators off, it’s more a store of wealth.
Do you see what this guys saying now
WE WILL TAME BTC, and they have, they’ve stopped run away prices, in fact look at the charts and you’ll see a slow steady decline to where they want it.
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:20:54
It only has speculative value, the price is only propped up by hodlers as is just as likely to go down to Zero, than go to a million.
It’s the same as white dog shit rare but has little use over all.

Here mr bluethunder is another example of flaws in the Blockchain, albeit patched now.
The point is though people at this time were saying the same thing BTC Blockchain can’t be hacked, when all along there was a security flaw that could of been pounced upon by a bad player. 
Would you like anymore examples off me, if you do I can oblige, I just hope you can see from this now how the general public view bitcoin and Blockchain, obviously with great mistrust.
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:14:31

Even the Blockchain failed in early days due to a bug with with you could create unlimited BTC, it’s maybe secure now, but it only survives by the skin of its teeth so to speak.

Secondly not that many people own it, and it’s to complicated compared to their trusty plastic card.

I have been all year and made reasonable profits, BTC is a shorters paradise ��.

Just like bill gates said, if he could short it he would, and he’d of been right, because if you go to the link I sent you, look at the price decline since $17000 dollar xmas 2017 down to now, you’ll clearly see it correlates with when CME brought out futures settled in cash.
So any brain dead could short BTC all year long and make a killing.
Like you’ve been shown, they have tamed it and are in charge, irrelevant of how many dingle berry coins you hodle in your wallets ��.

$200 more like.

Nope your right, but those bitcoin futures predict the price of those bitcoins, whereas the fake dollars are worth as much as the real ones.
See the point yet.?

I will agree to disagree, knowing full well BTC won’t ever become a world currency, it’s already failed as a currency and its verging on failing as a payment system, the only value it has is brought by hodler mentality, and speculation.
It’s not an asset that produces anything and it doesn’t pay out a dividend for anyone who does own it.
Pipe dreams are cheap, but they never work long term.
