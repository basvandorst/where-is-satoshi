You're leaving money on Cryptsy?   Man, if you thought MtGox was shifty...
I ain't gonna even feel bad for you when it goes down.

You've just proved her point. Congrats!

I'd take lindens over litecoin any day.
In fact, from best to worst:
Dogecoin &lt;- Auroracoin &lt;- Fedoracoin &lt;- socks &lt;-Lindens &lt;-Litecoin

Oh, no doubt. I'm pretty sure that the all the trolls are maybe one or two people with a bunch of accounts.  I'll get about 4 downvotes within a few minutes on an otherwise inactive thread.
Funny enough, the same thing happens when I make fun of a litecoiner/dogecoiner.  "Oh yea, all twenty of those downvotes were completely organic!"

I don't know if it's exactly what she meant, but the fact that bitcoin was created and became popular in a group that is not exactly welcome to women and non-white groups is a problem.
If you don't believe me, just look at any link that features a picture of a woman here. You'll usually find half a dozen comments by sperg-lords that say nothing but "Dat woman iz purty." That sort of shit is creepy and not welcoming.
Acknowledging that you are part of a group that has been systematically given a leg up opportunity here doesn't mean you're a bad person.  
Acknowledging that our community has elements that would like to shut out non-white non-males, whether active or passive, isn't a bad thing. In fact, we should work harder to shout down the dummies and work harder to welcome these other groups.

Ugh. Can't tell you how many people I've gotten interested in Bitcoin only to have them drop it the second they hear about Dogecoin.  The mere idea of a meme-coin casts a very stupid shadow over Bitcoin and makes them think that Bitcoin is itself a worthless meme.
Fuck dogecoin. Fuck "shibes". This is actually bad news.

Downvoted for obnoxious title. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:20:22
This is why we know that anti-bitcoin trolls are really just sad, pathetic people.  You are not a "skeptic". Just pathetic. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:40:23
Ah. Usually "stupid cow" is reserved for insulting women, so if you were actually referring the that Michael guy then I take it back :D

You're not gonna be happy with the short reply to your wall of text, but every thing you just said is complete and utter bull.  You might have a few personal anecdotes, but that doesn't amount to crap.
The whole "Women are just into feelings" is the narrative that men have built to maintain the status quo.  And this is exactly what the woman in OP's post is talking about.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:50:37
I literally can't roll my eyes hard enough.

A more diverse group involved in Bitcoin will lead to more diverse ideas and that's always a good thing.
I was going to type "In before weird comments about how women just don't "get" bitcoin yet" but I see I'm already too late :(  Guess what everyone! Lady brains are just as capable of understanding things as Man brains! WHOA!  What slows adoption of BTC by women, in many cases, in a general dismal of women and the *generally creepy nature of guys on the Internet*.

Wow. Your definition of "not spammy" is fucking retarded.

You've just proved her point. Congrats!

At least he isn't wasting his life trolling a subreddit about something he claims to not believe in. I'd be lying if I said I'd be interested in hearing whatever hand-waving explanation you have for yourself though.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:12:40
What a human piece of shit you are.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:15:25
If you value pieces of shit, then you're even more disturbed than I had even imagined.

Your services should be applied more frequently. Not just here, but across all the Internet.

I keep trying to warn people away from BTC-E, but people keep going there.
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:29:43
Downvoted.  All altcoins are scams, so why should we pick and choose which scams to support?  Ripple is just as good as LTC which is just as good as Dogecoin.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:45:44
I'm curious if you are consciously trying to legitimize bitcoin and the experiment as a whole on purpose, or you just don't know better.
Honest question.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:47:26
So, you get mad that someone makes a valid point about someone, and you're rebuttal against calling out someone's mental state is to totally flip out and call THAT person childish names?
I'm just gonna go ahead and put your name into the crazy pile. Thanks for playing our game, better luck next time.

Hmm, I guess you do.

The mental instability of the creator is a window into the awfulness that is Mastercoin, so it is relevant.
Also, I'm not about to spend time looking up posts from two plus years ago. Ain't worth the time. Believe me or don't.

Why bother making this post?
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:55:01
Uh, yea really.
As of right now, LTC and NMC is 8% lower than BTC over last 24h. The highest cap coin that is higher than BTC is quark.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:27:41
Hehe, I remember that one too.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:30:34
Metart does, but as far as I know it's "just" naked ladies being naked.  Not sure of any hardercore websites do.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:17:37
The guy behind mastercoin is an absolute crazy.  I remember on the bitcointalk forums way back when he posted some crazy rant using only memes (and, surprise, it didn't make any sense) and then would popup in any unrelated thread where someone posted a meme image and claimed to have inspired the poster.
So, in fact, he was claiming he had invented memes.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:58:45
If you think BTC is crazy you'll want to stay faaaaaaaar away from the other coins.
