Assuming that a channel is open then the problem is easy to solve. The issue here is if there's no channel open, which would require the buyer to open one. The TX fees could invalidate the payment entirely if the value of the item is small.
On top of it the buyer and seller would have to wait until the payment channel is open (in case there isn't one), I'm not imaging someone waiting for 15-60m just for wait for the confirmation of the payment channel since its on-chain.
All in all I personally don't see BTC suitable for small one-time transactions and unfortunately LN doesn't seem to address this. So, given this, how can BTC be broadly adopted?!

Meant to say a few sorry, comment corrected.
I guess it will basically depend on the overall adoption of layer 2, so far doesn't seem very promising but future will tell..

Makes sense, but in any event, comparing with the real world, LN would be the equivalent of an ATM system instead of a payment system. Since you would have to charge or maintain a balance whenever you want to make any payment using LN. And all charging a LN wallet would be subject to the conditions of the blockchain (block time validation &amp; TX fees).

I know ~~many~~ a few merchants that accept BTC and don't have a LN wallet. It doesn't necessary mean there's going to be an adoption.

True, I like to make difficult questions :)
