That's very true. Is your target audience people that are just looking to buy one or two bitcoins as spending money? Because it's almost the same concept on your end. They're coming in to buy a bitcoin and then spend it. Whether it's on gambling or it's on clothes, they're buying one and then spending it and there's no way to tell if this person is going to create a claim or not.
I'm not saying this is a bad idea, and I'm not saying this is any of my business. I actually like it, and I think it could be very, very secure. But I will tell you to be careful when you launch and REMEMBER. Always remember! "Just because it's your favorite idea, doesn't mean it's the best idea".

Print them out on ten different paperwallets, each piece of paper being 25 BTC each. (from a LASERJET printer! Ink runs!).
Make one copy of each paper. This will mean you now have 20 piece of paper (1 copy of the original 10).
Put the original copy in a security box and bury it in your backyard. Don't let your neighbors see you burying something in your back yard. They will snoop.
Put the other 10 papers in a house safe. The idea behind having two copies is if you wake up one morning and they were dug up, you can quickly withdraw from the ones in your house. Or if your house is on fire and the ones in your safe burn up, you can quickly withdraw from the ones you burried.
But one thing is certain. GET THEM OFFLINE ASAP. ASAP. A. S. A. P.

What part of "What's your opinion on BFL ship times" says "I'm treating this like a game"?
What part of saying "I'm skeptical about this company" says "this is a game to me."
What part of saying "I'm not sure if I should trust them with my money" says "I'm being careless, this is a game"?
What part of saying "I'm concerned about difficulty rising, and I want to be able to profit off of this new miner because this is money we're talking about, not a game." says "this is a game"?
Where was I asking for "some quantum amount of respect"? Where did I display absolutely none? I asked like 2 questions and got some responses from people with their opinions, then there's you just filling my inbox with "you're stupid i'm smart". Sorry, I didn't realize there was a subreddit for Oh wait, there isn't? You should create one. You'd make a great moderator. There's your respect, now quit being such a jerk.

I understand what you mean here. A player could just watch the blockchain and wait for a donation and say "yeah that was me".
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:04:33
We don't make much money, if any, off of donations so we can't really afford to pay for something like that. It looks like bitpay is, while cost effective to most, still out of or league. Anything else?

What he means is that users that don't have security issues won't feel threatened. But the moment it happens, you will feel immediate remorse. Like me. I have my GSXR sitting in an unlocked garage. I've never had any of my motorcycles stolen from me. So I will say "NBD" when thinking about security. But it probably will disappear if I don't do something soon.
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:36:37
Well that is slightly irrelevant and almost counter-intuitive as it completely misses the point. But I thank you for the effort anyway!

Not too long ago bitcoins were $13 each. That's when I took interest in them. When they hit $30 I caved and bought one and turned it into 15 playing Martingale on Roulette.
I gave one of my bitcoins to my buddy who turned it into 22 bitcoins playing Martingale on Blackjack.
What we didn't realize is that bitzino has a limit of something like a max bet which WOULD have screwed us. Our odds were 50/50 on the first bet, then something around like 75/25 on the second, and then 87/13 on the third, and so on and so forth. The math suggest that unless you lost 9 to 11 times in a row, you would be fine.
Well guess what? I was up to 14 btc. It took me 1 hour to turn 1 btc into 14 btc. Then I lost. And again. And again. And again. 11 times in a row, lost it all. My friend still had something like 20 btc, so he sent me one and I built it back up. Got it up to 7, and lost it all. Went to check the status of my friend - he had 22 BTC. Then he lost it all.
Martingale was fun as shit. It made me so much money. But I got stupid and didn't quit. If we had stopped, we would have made roughly $9300 if we sold them at 250/ea.

I'm more curious where they're shipping FROM.
Where is this warehouse at.......
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:48:35
I gave you my skype info, but I'll also hit you up on here.
Heard about them in November of 2012 but lost interest. Around February when the price was like $23/ea, my buddy bought like 3 and gave me one. Being the skilled player I am, I gambled it up to 214 bitcoins. Then I lost it all. Oh well, win some lose some right? I was slightly upset when I found out the price made it up to $265. That was rather infuriating, but whatever. I didn't pay for them to begin with.
After I gambled them all away, I ended up buying 2 or 3 from Bitcoin OTC's IRC channel. I gambled them away, too. I currently have 0.8 bitcoins. I have a gambling problem, and I am glad Bitcoin showed me that because otherwise I would never have known.
@_date: 2013-05-13 16:22:22
Good call. I just have that fear, though, that I'm never going to see this ASIC miner and when I finally do, it's going to be way too late. But live and learn, I guess.
@_date: 2013-05-13 16:18:43
Why would I send them my money after I just learned all that about them having a record of putting off ship dates? Man Reddit is facetious this morning.
Edit: Thanks though, I hadn't known that about them. Fuck BFL.
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:32:05
Tell ussssssssss!
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:02:58
I really don't think that's a good idea. A lot of people buy their bitcions then gamble it away and want to buy more. I understand you are being as secure as possible, but I am still more fond of the 12% the first time, 10 the next, and =/&lt;8 every following transaction after that.
Saying "you can only buy one per week" or something just seems so limiting to me. But that's just me, and this is not my business.

Right because an ASIC mining device is more like a roulette table then a piece of mining equipment? Sounds to me like you WANT to view bitcoins without seriousness. Good luck with your future, I'm done with this. At least the other comments are helpful.

I'm hearing a lot of this "they're not going to ship". But the estimate BFL says in that recording on the phone is they will have them shipping by June or July. Of course, they added a "at the earliest" so that probably doesn't mean shit.
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:15:03
Oh I thought maybe there would be a set-this-up fee or something! Coolio! :D
It doesn't seem likely that I will be able to (with my low skillset in programming) get it built so that as soon as they make a purchase they recieve their in-game perks. I believe it will all have to be done manually. The host we have, enjin, has a plugin for the server so that as SOON as a donator makes a donation, it issues a server command of my choice. If I want to give them the ability to fly for $5, then as soon as they buy that perk the server issues the command "/pex add user {name} essentials.fly" or something like that. I don't remember.
But that will be really hard to figure out with bitcoin payments. Unless Enjin starts using bitcoin as a payment method :) So far they have paypal, onebip, and something else.

Same here, only because of that 10% fee. Otherwise I would use it all the time. I know there's nothing he can do about that fee, same with any company, but shizzzz. Y'dig?
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:50:30
That works! :D Or I could, if they don't sign a message, send them .0001 BTC and ask the disputing users "How much did I send you back?"
Then they----Wait. They could just watch the blockchain :P

I bought in at $30 each. I bought two of them. Like this guy - for shits and giggles. Between a friend and me, we gambled it up to 36 bitcoins. Then lost it all. :)
It was a $60 lesson I learned and I regret nothing. It tought me that bitcoins were not only easy to get (unlike real money), but VERY easy to lose (much like real money).
After watching the market skyrocket in the past few weeks, I also learned something else: BTC are an investment.
@_date: 2013-05-21 04:54:47
If I were randomly given 100 BTC, it wouldn't leave Reddit. Everybody that did an IAmA that made it to the front page would get a bitcoin tip. Anywhere from .5 to 2 BTC per person, to try and get it even more mainstream.
I think somebody tipped Bill Gates a whole bitcoin back when it was something like $25. I don't think he even noticed. That's where I got the idea.
@_date: 2013-06-03 16:36:51
Very clever. I would tip you if I had bitcoins.

This isn't a casino, and this isn't a game. This is bitcoins we're talking about. I didn't go into a casino, I walked onto a field and asked the farmer how he likes the new model John Deere and whether or not they're reliable.

You are a very mean person. I got into BTC partially because of the widely accepting community. You sir have just put a damper on that. And I'm sorry, but I would have to say "speak for yourself" when you say "we will say told you so". I think maybe YOU would say that, but not the others.
When people come into my minecraft server saying things like "I need help with portforwarding" I don't say "USE GOOGLE SHITFACE. IF U CANT FIGR IT OUT THEN U SHOULDN USE MINECRAFT SRVR FUCKING MORON". Instead I explain what they need to do, and how it works, and exactly what it is they are doing. I'm not going nto get into this flame war with you, but I will tell you that if you can't say anything nice, please refrain from saying anything at all. All it does is make you into a bully.

That's because he didn't understand the importance of it. My buddy gave me a bitcoin once when it was like $18 or something, just for me to play around with. I turned it into like 20 bitcoins by gambling, then lost it all. I didn't even blink or care. It didn't matter to me because "who cares"? Now, if I could go back in time and see myself doing that I would kick myself in the teeth. I didn't think bitcoins were a joke back then, per say, but I was extremely careless with them because I didn't understand their worth and stuff. As it started climbing up to around $60 I got more and more interested. Now I'm obsessed.
But I digress. Your friend just didn't realize that it is literally ~$500 in his pocket. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:32:07
But you do understand why that exists, right? I mean, I'm sure his payment processor is charging out the ass, especially because of security reasons. I wouldn't be surprised if they're taking 8-9%. So I do fully understand why he must charge 10%. But I think that that digit is definitely going to throw a lot of people off. People want a bitcoin for 113, but end up paying 126. The buyers that are buying to hold on for a long time would surely go for this. But the buyers that are looking to spend their btc almost right away? Get back, jacc. No way would they spend an extra $13. Chances are whatever they're buying is ALREADY charging like .1 BTC for shipping and handling.
So he's almost backed into a corner here. I'm curious to see how this plays out. On one hand, he can go live at 10% right now and see how things play out. See if Reddit was just bitching or not. On the other hand, he can drop his rates, get probably the same traffic (because if people will pay 5%+$5 (something around 9%) then chances are they will pay the 10%), and lose a few bucks. But either way I am so deadly curious to see how this plays out. Hell if he needs an extra body to man phones, I'd be there to help. My main curiosity, though, is he stated this is a U.S. based company. The U.S. government doesn't like Bitcoins.

I was in a debate with somebody about 6 months ago over ATI vs. NVidea. He finally conceded and agreed with me that NVidea was superior, but said AMD cards are better for bitcoin mining. 
I was like, what the fuck is that? And I've been living in the rabbit hole ever since.

Well I have been playing with bitcoins for a long while now and I see all of these companies posting  here like "We're now taking bitcoins!" and I thought "well shit. why don't we?" Unfortunately our player base is like 12-17  year olds (hence why we have made ~$15 in the past month). But that shouldn't limit much :) If anything it will get them wondering.
