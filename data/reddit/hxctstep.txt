I had to watch the movie twice to really get it, because I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to any of this stuff. However, after seeing it for a second time, I realized how screwed up the whole thing was and can understand my family's frustration back then when I was too young to understand any of it.

I have been watching GDAX for the last couple of days and was contemplating buying a small portion of bitcoin. Once I saw it go up $1k in the last 48 hours I said "fuck it, now's the time"

I’m wanting to put more in as well. In my mind, it’s now or never. Luckily at this point it’s pretty stable, but let’s hope it keeps going up and up.

This was me, except I bought at $11.8k haha. Still gonna HODL.

Yeah, I no longer check the prices multiple times a day, maybe once every other day. I consider it my contribution to the technology whether it succeeds or fails, I’m not too worried.

I figured that was the way to do it, I bought from CB then transferred to a wallet but then I was like “well I don’t know what to do from here so I’ll hodl”
