Well, the issues *are* very technical. The transaction malleability issue that has recently become widely known is *very* technical, and difficult to understand by anyone who doesn't know the protocol inside and out. If you want to firmly grasp bitcoin's *technical* risks, then yes you should be in IT or very familiar with IT concepts. There are many other *non-technical* risks associated with bitcoin, however, that are described in this thread.

The problem with MtGox is that you can't save to a paper wallet because withdrawals are disabled. The fact that you save to a paper wallet means you have the bitcoins. Once you do that the bitcoins are no longer controlled by MtGox so whatever happens to them is up to you. If you buy MtGox coins right now MtGox will simply show you an account balance on their site but you won't be able to transfer them anywhere.

I disagree that this market is a lot older than the RIAA or Hollywood. Prehistoric man drew on caves for free for all to see. Pharaohs and Kings commissioned artists to create work to be put on display for the public. Only since the last 50 years or so have private corporations commissioned art and withheld it from the public until they paid. This model is recent and is due to die now that the internet has matured. Society will always demand art and will commission it (see BBC, PBS, CBC, Kickstarter etc) but distribution is now free and nobody will pay for something they can get for free.

I see. I did not test on linux unfortunately but I will see what I can do. For Chrome in Mac when you right click text it automatically highlights the entire word.

Ok let me try and answer everything.
You can encrypt your private key using open source CryptoJS AES. An attacker will only be able to decrypt it if they get your password somehow.
The extension keeps your private key (encrypted if you set a password, otherwise plaintext) in the browser, so Google takes care of it. If you sign in to multiple Chrome browsers your wallet will be synced to all of them. 
You send funds to the wallet by pushing a transaction to the block chain :) Not sure what you mean by that. It's just a private key and address, and it is used to send and receive transactions.
As for 2fa, it's been requested in the video post as well. I will definitely add this in the near future.
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:26:37

No no 2^256 which means 2 to the power of 256. The number of possible values in a 256 bit number is 2 to the power of 256. It is an insanely large number that we can't really comprehend because there's no reference in our minds that is a number that large.

In your second example, if you do that the dollar will still be spent first because people will try to get rid of them as fast as possible. I think the more accurate result will be merchants refusing to accept dollars and only bitcoins.

Sort of. What happened is this:
Attacker has bitcoin in MtGox. He withdraws bitcoin, and gets the transaction from the blockchain. He then decodes the transaction and mutates it by padding one of the non-signed values. This padding will completely change the transaction id hash. Now the attacker takes this new transaction and submits it to other nodes in a double spend. Since both transactions are identical except for the transaction id, only one will be confirmed. The attack is successful if the attacker's transaction is confirmed, which is partly due to chance and speed of propagation of their transaction. Now, MtGox's wallet software tracks wallet balances by their *transaction ids*, which is the flaw. So now the attacker contacts support saying the transaction never went through, even though if MtGox was tracking the inputs to the address instead of the transaction id they would see the funds actually were sent. So MtGox will credit the attacker since they can't verify the transaction went through.
Now try explaining that as if I were 5 and didn't know how Bitcoin works.

This is like breaking down all the technical risks associated with using the internet. All the different protocols that the internet runs on (UDP, TCP/IP, HTTP) are very technical and cannot be explained in layman terms. Exploits in Bitcoin will occur at a very technical level as well which cannot really be explained to laymen. Just because someone doesn't understand how attacks can happen on the internet, doesn't mean they can't still follow proper safety like not clicking on dodgy links and not divulging personal info.

So up about 90% in 10 days in 2015. Let's have a look in the past shall we?

* June 9, 2011 - $29.58
* ~333% in 10 days
* March 31, 2013 - $92.59
* April 9, 2013 - $213.72
* ~230% in 10 days
* November 19, 2013 - $494.68
* November 29, 2013 - $1,132.26
* ~230% in 10 days
How is it getting more volatile, not less?

Yeesh this is really too tough of a requirement to register your node. Anyways, the :wq command should be entered in the screen with all the ~ characters down the side. It stands for write and quit, so you create a new index.html file. You seem to be doing it back on the command prompt. Pressing escape should only take you out of edit mode. As for your server not running, I'm not sure I can debug that. Try any other simple server and run it in the directory where you created the index.html file.

Actual value of volume is not up. That is only the volume in bitcoin. Since the value has dropped to about a fifth of it's all time high the volume of bitcoins has to increase to move a fifth of the value.

Originally full nodes were also miners. Hence the incentive to run them. However, after the difficulty increased and it was infeasible to mine without a pool, there was no longer a reason to keep mining with a full node so they were decoupled.

There needs to be a new use case that makes sense for more people to want to buy bitcoin. The only real use case right now that requires people to buy bitcoin is if they want to buy illegal things off the darknet markets or pay hackers bitcoin ransom. There is literally nothing else other than speculating that gives people a reason to go buy bitcoin. Everything else is still better using fiat.

Yes but you can only purchase something with confirmed coins. If you receive coins from someone else and then want to buy something you have to wait until they get confirmed. If a block is not mined for half an hour then you have to wait half an hour to spend.

It's a penny stock, not a pump and dump. If you look at the [price charts]( and zoom out to 2 years, you can see on Feb 10, 2014 it was trading at $4.57 then crashed and got down to a bottom of about $0.06 a few months later. You're over a year late for the pump and dump. It is currently trading at about $0.17.

Well no, you can't spend unconfirmed outputs that didn't come from your wallet. So if you receive funds and they don't get confirmed for an hour you can't spend them for an hour. This is essentially the same problem when Ripple goes down.

Not sure why nobody has given the real answers, but here goes: 
Your 20mb blocks limit is not correct and not at all what Gavin proposed. You can see his proposal [here]( and the graph of what the max blocksize will be [here]( In 2020 the max blocksize will be over 100mb. 
After the block size is increased, other optimizations like invertible bloom lookup tables and optimizing verification code in nodes will increase the transaction rate even further. 
Stop with your concern trolling.

Yeah I get what you're saying but I think that number of nodes isn't entirely indicative of popularity either. Running a node doesn't really provide a benefit. It's really just for enthusiasts to do because they can't mine anymore. Whereas trading on an exchange can make them profit.
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:26:06
Previous block was 14:55:55 and this block was 14:56:42. What happens is that as soon as a new block is mined the mining pool operator needs to construct a new block and send it to the miners. Between this time the miners will be idle, so the operator just sends them an empty block in the meantime. Sometimes they get lucky mining this empty block. This doesn't have anything to do with smaller blocks being more likely to win the race since the most time is spent trying to mine the block, not transmitting the data.

Instructions on how to set this up:
First, you need to be running a full node and have the port open. Instructions [here](
Now you need 3 things: your IP address ($ip), your port ($port) and your bitcoin address ($address).
Next, open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following:
    curl -H 'Accept: application/json; indent=4' -d 'bitcoin_address=$address' 
You should get a response that looks like this for the request:
    {
        "success": true
    }
Now in your command prompt type the following:
    vi index.html
    i
    $address
Hit escape.
    :wq
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
Now forward connections to your router from port 80 to port 8000 of the machine where you entered those commands. To test that it works, enter $ip in your browser and you should see $address.
Then you are done.
