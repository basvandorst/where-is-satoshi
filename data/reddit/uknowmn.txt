Hmm... **1,74 BTC** not great, not terrible.

When using Coinbase, do this to buy a coin
Guys -
When buying a coin on Coinbase do this:
1. Close a tab with Coinbase website
2. Open Binance website
3. buy bitcoin on Binance &amp; transfer coins to your cold wallet
That is all. Run free my children.

In my particular case, Polkadot is a multi-chain framework platform developed to facilitate interoperability and scalability of blockchains that can plug into its 'Relay Chain'.  
Amoveo is a blockchain for the enforcement of investment and insurance contracts (Its founder designed Augur and Aeternity).

We saw that Bakkt and other institutional investors-focused services failed to impact the price of bitcoin. These days news doesn't have much power as it used to be back in 2017. 
Binance lost its KYC data  — **no one cares**;
Libra failed wit support from giants like PayPal, Visa and etc — **no one cares**;
Telegram TON is about to postpone its project due to problems with the SEC — **no one cares**.
I would suggest keeping an eye on small but still highly-potential projects. Prediction markets, DeFi and so on.   
Don't expect much of a skyrocket surge of BTC in the upcoming future.

While there is uncertainty with the BTC market, better take a look at small but potential projects like Polkadot, Amoveo and etc.
