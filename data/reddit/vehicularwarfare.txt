Theoretically, can we blacklist all of the attacker's addresses as they are known? What would be the consequences for that? Sorry if noob question.

If everybody rushes for the exits via BTC you won't have to wait 3 months for $10k/coin.It would happen in minutes. Until arbitrage kicks in, that is. What they really should do, is buy BTC on OTC markets and reimburse everyone who lost BTC, in BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:46:11
That means 61.5% of Btc WERE stolen.What they need to explain is why they're using just the customers' assets for the bailout and none of their one.

They are going to give us shares in their "wonderful" company.I mean, what more could you possibly want? Isn't that contributing?
Ask Zane he'll [tell]( you. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:52:56
With that sweet 36% haircut across all of the customers' assets, of course.

Given the centralization of mining today, I would say that would be quite possible.Has someone from BFX contacted some of the top pool operators?
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:42:46
Can confirm, both on sms token and honeydicked part.Also site seems to be down again for now. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:35:36
That would sound like a total flustercuck to me.People would rush for the doors liquidating their unwanted assets at the same time and ending up with far less than 64% of their original holdings. 
I have no idea how they will try to pull this off.
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:23:52
64% of the original amount.

A quick mining calculator reveals that an Antminer S9 with 0.01 $/kWh outputs about 88 dollars per month in profit at current BTC prices (6600$/BTC).And that excludes any kind of additional operational costs like cooling, wages etc. So unless you have  electricity much cheaper than 0.01 $/kWh I don't see how you guys are making any profit from this, let alone your clients.

182k btc is like 2 months worth of LBC volume.Not sure where he got that number either.
@_date: 2017-02-26 10:19:17
Holy cow! Since late November, they've been having more volume than the EU. Probably one of the catalysts of the end of 2016's rally.

Then why does stage 1 devaluation appear to have an inverse correlation to BTC than stage 2 does?

Looks like your blockchain is about to brake loose right after the genesis block and might just hit USS Federal Reserve which is known to navigate the treacherous waters of memepool.

I suggest they try to ban the purple blockchains and then immediately ban the pink ones too.Do these idiots even know what they are talking about? I've had it with these retards trying to ban math every couple of months. Is this where our tax money goes to nowadays?

Sure. I'm done arguing about fictional numbers anyway.

Does she really think Hash rate equals throughput? She clearly says "1.5 EH/s allows the bitcoin network to achieve  7 tps". WUT?

The video suggests that 24% of the world population **knows** what bitcoin is.That is an insane amount of people. 1.7 billion to be more specific.And out of those 1.7b, just 250k had the disposable income to actually invest in it? Let's just say the WatchMojo guys are pulling numbers out of their asses.  
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:28:27
If they truly understood its potential, yes. 24% might have heard of it but I really doubt they understood what it was.
@_date: 2019-08-13 15:12:37
There was also a joke about bitcoin on "Real Time" with Bill Maher recently iirc. Something like "How do you get rid of the ghosts in your house?
You start talking to them about bitcoin". Badum tssss.

Looks like the CFTC has seen the light. Can we please get a bitcoin ETF now? 
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:53:27
If 24% of the population knew what a bitcoin was, then 24% would own at least 1 bitcoin or at least tried to.There are enough satoshis for everyone though..
@_date: 2015-08-05 21:32:50
You expect mining to still be profitable at anything less than $500/coin?I don't see how.
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:16:41
Just make a reminder for this time next year and post the current price.We'll see who has the last laugh.. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:51:09
I should now mention that my issue got "settled" as bfx support called it, and I was able to withdraw my coins.
Those negative 18 dollars were subtracted manually by them, from my BTC balance, but I can't for the life of me figure out how they got there in the first place ,nor was I informed by their staff.Probably one last fleece before they decided to let me escape with my coins.
P.S. There is no way those 18$ were exchange fees as I had nowhere near that amount in BTC. Fees were usually 4$ max for me. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:58:18
I'm sorry for anyone's losses, but opening a leveraged long position without any stop losses in place is irresponsible, to say the least. Especially when everyone saw those huge ask walls being torn to shreds way before the actual dump to 162.
@_date: 2015-08-18 23:16:07
Finex had a 10k btc wall at 250 that just got destroyed by the latest shorts/closing longs.I don't think that 700 wall on Kraken will save us for much longer.
P.S. Look at the orderbook of the exchanges with bigger volume than Kraken.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:05:50
Eversince the runup to 315 price was steadily declining anyway.Unfortunately, i don't think we have seen the bottom yet.Hopefully, devs will reach some kind of compromise soon or else it will get rough out there...
@_date: 2015-08-08 16:53:00
Meanwhile the price tanks.Thanks Louis.
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:55:53
So if demand is maintained at 1,000,000$/day, is it safe to assume that we'll have at least $555.55/BTC by this time next year, after the reward halving? 
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:28:47
How hard is it for the increase max amount proponents to  grasp the term: infinitely divisible?It could have been 10.5 mil just as 5.25 mil max cap. It really doesn't matter as long as those coins are infinitely divisible.
@_date: 2015-07-29 03:10:04
There's currently a spam attack going on.If you didn't use a fee larger than 0.0003 you'll have to wait a few hours.
@_date: 2015-07-29 00:02:22
That's bullish a.f. in my book. I mean with 10% annual inflation the price keeps going up.Next year after halving, if demand stays at current levels price will easily double.And that would make mining somewhat profitable.My guess is that we will stay above previous ath but stable.
@_date: 2015-07-28 22:58:38
Yep, my Finex withdrawal also took 4 hours.Is there a
 "higher than usual fee" spam attack going on?
@_date: 2015-07-28 16:15:36
Umm... Wouldn't it be more profitable for miners to mine the full reward and you know... NOT sell their remaining 11 coins until they're happy with the price?
From what I've read most miners sell only to cover for the costs of operation anyway.The rest they hodl.

If anyone wanted to do a PR attack they would get Bernie Madoff to do it.Tyson is still an idol to millions regardless of his financial decisions.

And now coins from the Bitfinex hack in 2016 are on the move again. Coincidence? Nah, that totally wasn't an inside job, was it? This has the potential to royally screw the market for a long time. At least that den of thieves that was BFX will be no more..
@_date: 2019-04-25 17:11:53
So if your stupid shitcoin went over 5k dollars per coin, fees wouldn't become the same issue for those people, since they are calculated in sat/byte?  It's easier to have low fees when your shitcoin is valued at less than 6% and you have no onchain transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-28 18:41:23
Does anyone know what % those 3600 daily mined coins gets sold?

Riiiight.Let's keep bitcoin on life support by raising the 21mil cap.Let's maintain enough inflation as other world economies do.Great thinking, guy!
Get it through your skull, dude, if bitcoin doesn't get enough adoption in the next 10 years, to incentivize miners through transaction fees, then it would have been a failed project.

Even if they succede in creating a successfull blockchain, witch i very much doubt, they are still tethering it to the good ol' fiat inflationary currency.
Good riddance you greedy bastards! We don't need you anymore!
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:51:03
Why wouldn't he predict 1 mil a year after the 2020 halving? The supply shock allways takes full effect the year after, like we had in 2013,2017, potentially 2021? Or does he predict an even bigger increase after that? If it were my dick on the line I'd go with 2021, just sayin.. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 19:21:19
Where would they do that? OK coin? Bitfinex? Puh-lease.

I think you got it backwards.They are borrowing bitcoin to short it and will need to cover that short as soon as they receive their BCC. Good luck covering 43k shorts without causing massive slipage to the upside.It's going to be a bear slaughter out there.     
@_date: 2015-10-05 20:13:46
I don't think those are fiduciary for institutions.
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:00:26
Great timing as 5k BTC shorts were squeezed(liquidated) on Bitfinex alone just the other day. The motto should read:"Be the next "hero", short Bitcoin today on Etoro!
