@_date: 2018-09-13 18:01:54
and 76,000 nodes up - 
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:00:56

listening means it's open to the internet and anyone can connect to it and use it.. the non listening are private and usually only the people that put them up can connect to them and use them. think merchants or anyone that needs their own node they can trust 100% to verify transactions. even though they are not listening they still communicate with other nodes and help keep the network secure. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 18:05:43
I'm betting on Bitcoin because it's 100% decentralized and already at 95,000 nodes. nothing will stop it and it's growing stronger every day. taproot and schnorr soon !!!! prototype code has been written, testing now - 
@_date: 2018-08-23 17:58:33
all the legal cannabis shops in the US should switch 100% to Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-24 03:41:56
the petrodollar needs to die already
@_date: 2018-08-29 08:33:35
this map only shows listening nodes. there are far more nodes up - 
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:59:01
generate a bunch of addresses that only you have the keys to, and store them in a database and assign them to users
@_date: 2018-10-19 19:35:14
I can do API with node.js !! **edit** okay got this so far - 
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:05:27
my Bitcoin transactions cost half a penny. I'm happy.
@_date: 2018-10-27 01:00:37
hahahaha I'll be so happy when Bitcoin destroys MasterCard
@_date: 2018-10-29 19:41:30
it's on the todo list. I have users testing other stuff once I get that feedback and fix those issues I'll work on advertising and stuff like the front page
@_date: 2018-10-23 03:49:54
you guys are so dume. you can't give a nobel prize to an artificial intelligence. besides, it probably went back to its timeline.
@_date: 2018-10-20 18:28:27
add node counts! you can scrap from my site - 
@_date: 2018-10-30 16:48:58
almost 69,000 nodes online. I think the Bitcoin network is more safe and secure than ever before - 
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:30:51
YUP. massive.
@_date: 2018-10-19 18:07:11

@_date: 2018-10-21 08:09:05
it's the trump tariffs
@_date: 2018-10-13 05:23:41
I'm 100% Bitcoin. They'll have to nuke the whole planet to stop it.
@_date: 2018-10-13 18:18:17
fuck yes! I'd trust a blockchain voting system over this corrupt pile of shit voting system in the US
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:32:25
countries all over the world are dropping the petrodollar. it's fucked. good riddance.
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:26:31
I really hope so. right now in the US there are 6 vacant homes for every 1 homeless person. pretty fucking disgusting if you ask me.
@_date: 2018-10-23 00:06:37
my website is Segwit! uses Bech32 addresses -  transactions are about half a penny right now.
@_date: 2018-10-23 07:23:01

@_date: 2018-10-22 19:03:11
don't atomic swaps make shapeshift irrelevant anyway?
@_date: 2018-10-17 05:51:56

@_date: 2018-10-17 04:20:47
I think we'd just abandon the system and start a new one at that point, no?
@_date: 2018-10-19 23:29:26
okay here for now
**edit**  
node.js -   
PHP (not tested yet) -   
@_date: 2018-10-19 18:56:45
oh cool, thanks. hey how can I put your total node count on my website to say how many total nodes up?
@_date: 2018-10-22 19:09:07
should I feel less bad that ShapeShift wouldn't hire me then?
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:36:26

@_date: 2018-10-14 23:03:55
enjoy friend - 
@_date: 2018-10-25 17:15:26
100% the NSA has a copy of it. I'd say about 2% chance they'll do anything with it. but even that small 2% would concern me.
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:56:13
UI is what I suck at. will hire a proper designer when I have enough users. I'll be adding lots more features! working on built in music player and video player right now
@_date: 2018-10-14 23:06:05

isn't like 85% of his net worth in Bitcoin? I've read everything about him I think he is just against people that blindly follow Bitcoin without knowing anything about it - like with anything else? I dono. I like Voorhees. but I'm trying to get a job working for him so I might be a little bias.
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:03:23
recent stability is only because the shills and FUD pushers are busy with midterms
@_date: 2018-10-19 21:53:30
PHP sure! whats your db? or where are we scraping the data from
@_date: 2018-10-21 23:34:12
