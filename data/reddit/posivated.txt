Is it even worth attempting arbitrage with the fees the way they are?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:03:58
If anyone can come up with a good explanation that the average person would understand without having any reference to a stock then please say it
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:36:49
Lol that is why we have a sticky for investing recklessly.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:19:11
I do believe you posted this a short time ago and deleted it because you are either getting scammed or misunderstood what you have been told.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:39:24
And what are you free from?
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:38:46
Well damn, why don't they advertise that on the popup!
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:21:26
Bitcoin isn't a currency, it is an asset that can work as a currency. &lt;- taken from wikipedia.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:20:51
Maybe he does and we just don't know about it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:41:34
I think if I had someone that would trade for me and with a 45% return I would stop working forever.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:11:01
An actual example of a correction was 2 days ago when it spiked to 19.5k and dropped 15k.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:55:04
Your coins aren't insured but money in your wallet is.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:58:16
Lol ALOT more coins but only loses 10k
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:29:36
Uh Andreas Antonopoulos is on the oversight board for the CME, pretty sure they fully understand the tech.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:56:36
Except it isn't all or nothing, some of these people are making even more money than just hodling...You do understand that bitcoin is only a thing because people buy and sell? Bitcoin doesn't inherently go up just because. If everyone held you would make 0$ and lose money.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:14:26
So then explain it to the average person...you seem to not be capable of doing that without referencing stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:28:45
Because that isn't a guarantee...
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:03:06
I asked this a few days ago and was told by one person no then two people immediately said once you sell the bitcoin you are liable for taxes even if you keep it in your gdax usd wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:17:46
Keep dodging
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:08:40
Well if that's the case then he really isn't spending Bitcoin, it would be no different than cashing out what you need
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:29:26
If you don't think they are already doing this then you may need to take a better look around.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:22:39
Even if it is, the amount of information and time Wikipedia has saved the internet is priceless
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:33:45
I think you think its way more complicated than it is, do a little research and you'll see it's all pretty basic as far as paying taxes go.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:12:51
I'll be sure to send that to the average person, hey, hold on and go to this website and fuck around with this for 15 minutes, then you'll understand bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:14:08
There is plenty of talk about it but we have a lot of fanatical bitcoin followers here so it usually gets downvoted and then people delete said post.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:53:05
Well there is one thing I can say for certain, this will not happen, both ways.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:18:27
Because they don't believe in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:25:15
I'm with you there but there are plenty of people who think it's a problem
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:21:37
They absolutely want bit coin to fail.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:37:12
Well it has gone lower than 11,300 earlier today so it is possible.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:06:47
You sound like a person who doesn't live in the real world. Debt is going to exist forever even if the world uses bitcoin. Debt isn't some concept the banks created, it's been around for thousands of years. You are also confused if you think the banks are scared of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:45:08
It's always interesting here when someone tries to have a realistic discussion about whats actually going on with bitcoin people like you think people are upset or salty, why would I be salty? Do you know my financial situation? It sounds to me like you are actually the one who is scared of what could happen to the price.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:05:25
Being very new to the scene I can already see issues with transactions all over, not just with coinbase. The idea of 10% of your savings is probably sound advice and I looked at my initial investment like he says "you’ve got to pretend you’ve already lost your money".
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:31:03
A 5k drop in a matter of hours isn't a natural movement.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:30:57
If we go off what happened during the 19k Spike it doesn't actually look that hard to short it if you have the right people doing it
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:17:07
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:19:20
The entire idea of bitcoin is fucky though, the fact is the price was 19k, there were trades being completed at 19k. Gdax crashed when whoever it was decided to sell.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:20:53
It happened in Thursday so not yesterday. It was the day a guy made 200m usd, there was a post about it. It didn't Spike to 19 and trades were made at over 18.5k
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:17:23
If it went up to 90k and you didn't sell and decided to hodl then you would be an idiot because 90k isn't even remotely imaginable for this coming week regardless of what wall street does.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:16:08
Very curious to see where its going, wonder why its blowing up. I'm assuming its because of futures stagnating the bitcoin price this week.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:43:29
So like coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:42:47
Never paid a fee for an account ever in 10 years with regions Bank lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:19:39
Well that's dumb, seems counter to the whole global decentralized currency.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:20:50
Just did lol, hurt a little but it was hard not to
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:52:54
Well that's great if you aren't in the US because as soon as you cash out, exchange Bitcoin for altcoins the IRS knows. It is worth the risk
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:11:03
While that show is popular there is no way we made it to 19k because of it
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:22:11
Jesus, please don't bring the word millennial here. We have enough garbage here as it is. It isn't going to disrupt the system, the rich are going to stay rich and in fact many of them are probably invested in bitcoin, so while you want to "devalue the horde" you are actually probably making them more wealthy.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:49:03
I'm not being salty but there are people who will look at this and think "let me take out a loan and do the same thing" which isn't helping anyone. It's great you have allot of crypto wealth but it could all be gone tomorrow. For anyone reading this please read the sticky, it's incredibly informative.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:36:27
There is a wide variety of reasons the banks and wall street want Bitcoin to fail
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:07:35
He has a very informative video in the front page
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:50:59
This is sarcasm right?
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:12:03
What do you mean it wasn't real? One person made 200 million USD during that time.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:57:25
If you are in the US you aren't going to be legally avoiding taxes in any way, it's all sent to the IRS. So either hodl or pay taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:47:25
You are probably better off looking through old couches for cash people hid and forgot about. This has happened more times than people finding hard drives with bit coins on them.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:28:49
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:43:22
What are you trying to say here?
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:13:13
Yea and on that same street you can be robbed of your bitcoin and theres nothing you can do about it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:59:51
Actually completely ignore this and read the sticky post about investing recklessly.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:25:55
What would stop them from doing the same thing there? This isn't just going to be about Bitcoin at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:16:25
Went to Europe about a month ago, the volatility of the euro to dollar is less than 1% of bitcoin. Still waiting on that explanation.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:02:18
Another form of currency that has no static value that you can't actually exchange for anything physical which has no static exchange rate that is incredibly volatile that most businesses don't support nor the government but it is traded and it's value is based on the market... It's a fucking stock guys
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:02:04
Well idk much about all this but the 24 hour volume on gdax is double what's it been in weeks. That's allot of coins to be throwing back when the time comes.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:05:46
Someone said that 15 minutes ago when it was at 13k lol
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:08:16
Eh, at this point it looks like theres no stopping litecoin lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:15:27
And what US Ban would that be?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:29:18
So being close to the end of the year I at one point cashed out and left my money in the gdax wallet, have since bought back in with my additional profits. Do I need to pay taxes this year on those profits? if I don't cash out again or do cash out and have lost more money than my original investment how do I go about paying something on less?
Edit; Trying to word it better.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:25:15
I just hope people are smart enough to sell at the spike and buy at the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:07:39
There isn't a chance of it not spiking, it will certainly happen and as long as gdax doesn't crash it'll be a good time to make some money because it's going to correct. I'm most certainly a believer and a skeptic, and invested.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:20:56
Just did lol, hurt a little but it was hard not to
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:45:00
Also since no one sadly mentioned it, pay your taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:23:21
You have officially failed at explaining what bitcoin is to the average person.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:47:30
Uh pretty sure the community wants bitcoin to be mainstream, all the talk is about making bitcoin a valid currency and guess how you do that, mainstream. Without money coming in bitcoin will not grow, cannot grow. Don't be so stupid in thinking bitcoin grew because of a niche community, it grew because more and more people started investing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:46:43
Explaining to the average person what Bitcoin is, is nearly impossible without referring to stocks. You buy them like stocks, on exchanges like stocks, you invest like stocks, the price of them fluctuates and functions like a stock.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:28:15
Coinbase only insures what they keep online which is 2% of total funds. So, while unlikely it is possible someone could get a hold of the offline funds and do some major damage and that is not insured.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:41:53
What about if you purchase something with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:53:49
For the love of god please claim this on your taxes, you are going to screw your self over in the long run (or short run) if you just cash out 100k and not pay a cent in taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:51:43
So how would you explain what bitcoin is to my girlfriend who has no idea what it is
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:14:54
So obviously those bitcoins aren't insured and with bitcoin being the way it is they are completely screwed then?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:03:05
This was a terrible explanation to give to anyone interested in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:03:24
If Andreas says there will be dips then I feel pretty confident that there will be.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:18:50
That's exactly how I thought and for some reason have had a lot less stress about owning litecoin since the swings haven't been huge.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:31:00
I would never buy anything with bitcoin, it's like selling.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:56:03
I too love steam and valve but they are stopping support for now for what I feel is a good reason. Half this sub is about people bitching about fees and now someone is making a stand and it's a problem? You should be standing with Valve, not against them.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:44:44
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:12:18
Until you cash out, you aren't avoiding the IRS in the US
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:17:56
Ah, didn't realize that was new. Was looking into it a bit ago and found I couldn't open an account.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:40:28
I have never bought anything with bitcoin but if you pay rent with it are you actually giving your landlord actual bitcoin or is it being converted into USD (Or whatever money) at the time of payment?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:19:20
All I asked for what an explanation of what bitcoin is to the average person that they would understand, you have failed thus far and I'm not even the only person on this post that has asked and you haven't delivered.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:56:07
I wasn't into bitcoin back then but the capital letter and special character thing on passwords doesn't feel like it would be that old. And jesus how do you have texts from 2013, I don't even have texts from a month ago.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:44:11
Those damn millennials might finally be good for something, interest in gold...gtfo
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:57:14
You must not live in the United States or be completely blind at the current narrative. I've seen more overwhelming support for businesses that are doing something against gun violence than the minority of people who advocate for guns.
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:45:32
Money in the bank is the only reason most people can even buy bitcoin lol
