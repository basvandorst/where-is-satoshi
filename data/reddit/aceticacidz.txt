Yes, but the stronger evidence that it's legit is that when I sent in another support request through Mt Gox basically saying "What the fuck is wrong with your support team?" the request was merged with my earlier question and the same Dennis answered, apologized for the inconvenience, and modified his request to not ask for the password.
I see this as a severe lapse in support operations, and makes me very wary of the whole service. I'd like to send this up the chain, any leads?

Just created the account last night

I'm happy to forward any other information you need. Unless it's my password.

Yep, that's it. Idiot support confirmed, absurdly elaborate phishing scam denied.

Gox just sent me a full mea culpa: 
Happy that they're acknowledging their mistake and the seriousness of the situation. Very disappointed that it happened in the first place, especially from a financial service.

Is it safe to send this via PM?

How do I double check? Happy to provide any relevant screenshots. The certificate is verified by Chrome.
There's no way they would've found my actual email if it was a scam since the only time I entered in was during sign-up. When I asked for an email change request, I entered in an alt and not my original. It would be quite the elaborate set-up and that explanation makes a lot less sense than a dumbass tech support guy.

It was in response to a simple email change request I was having trouble with, fyi.
