There is secular objective morality, so you definitely can say those things without god. You're arguing that it's just *opinion* to say something like 'absolute unrelenting maximal suffering for everyone' is 'bad'. Well, if you can't say that, I'm not sure you're sane. 
I could throw the argument back to you and say that basing your morals on god is arbitrary at best. Does god command us not to kill because killing is wrong, or is killing wrong because god says it's wrong? If the former, you don't need god for morals. If the latter, then why call what god commands 'good'? How do we know that god is good? Isn't that just your opinion?
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:34:00
Ha. Is there anything objective to you? We didn't have (and still may not have) a universally acceptable definition of several areas of mathematics. They weren't objective before? They're still not objective now?
Edit:

OK, so you think there are no facts about health? It is simply unknowable whether an obese 103 year old with multiple cancers is less healthy than Michael Phelps? Got it. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:56:04


Do you disagree that 'maximal unrelenting suffering for all conscious creatures' is 'bad'?
Edit: And are you implying that health is subjective? I'd call that... controversial, at best.
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:46:28
That's a rather odd view. Imagine if a sizable group of people claimed that god dictates what health is, and that includes removing your left leg. Meanwhile, 'secular health' people claim that health is just maximizing your physical potential (or something along those lines). 
Now, translating your argument, there'd be 'widespread disagreement' in what secular health is if there is no god, since all views on health are now secular. 
I'd rather say that secular ethics are those that do not have a (real or imaginary) god as axiomatic.  


This just makes my point. You can have an objective view of health (and morality) without god.
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:57:56
Oh boy, this is getting bizarre. I'm out. I'll leave you with this: secular morality is as objective as secular health. Neither require a god to make factual claims. Both have broad agreement in many (most?) areas. Take from that what you will. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:18:22


I would imagine something like a universally accepted non-contradicting definition. 


Something along the lines of "good" = maximizing well-being of conscious creatures in the long term, and "bad" = opposite of good (eg - maximizing suffering of conscious creatures in the long term). Well-being and suffering are fairly well-understood in general terms, I would think, and are obviously subject to better understanding in the future. Compare them to 'healthy' and 'unhealthy'. 
Again, do you consider health to be subjective or objective? If the former, I'd rather not continue the conversation since it will be fruitless. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:01:19
I'd say that's a decent first-pass definition, but probably too simplistic. As a note, a perfect definition isn't required to yield facts. NB - health. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:36:12
I wouldn't say they're *all at odds* with each other, as if there's no widespread agreement. Even a relatively 'settled' definition of 'health' permits a ton of disagreement. All things equal, is it healthier to be able to jump higher or run faster? Give me a non-disputed definition of health.

My point is that it's *incredibly* weak evidence, and contemporaneous corroboration would have been the only thing to really substantiate it.


Right, so they realize that it's weak evidence. Again, the entire thing is to get a settlement, because they know Craig won't be able to prove himself. 


Sorry, I don't buy this line. You may have archived a few things, but surely you're not responsible for *all* of the things Craig left, and the assertion that he deleted all the incriminating evidence is unfalsifiable.


I hadn't seen that. I'll have to take a look. But, yes, pretty weak evidence.


The facts are different, however. It has less evidentiary weight for Szabo for two reasons: the fact that he was so interested in nearly the *exact* same topic means it's more likely that it was purposefully ignored. Also, as mentioned, his overall output went down significantly during that time period. Not the same with Craig.
I do 'bite the bullet' and admit that it *reduces* my belief that Szabo is Satoshi, but not by as much (and my prior for Szabo being Satoshi was orders of magnitude higher than for Craig anyway).
I'm not sure if I ever got your opinion on the faked PGP keys and blog posts. Craig has defended both of them as being authentic, but they've been proven to be backdated beyond a reasonable doubt. What do you think the most likely explanation is? 
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:02:03


If he remembered the logo (B with lines) and 'digital money', one would expect that he'd at least have **mentioned** it to *someone* at some point. It's just yet another suspicious element of the story.


But, as you know, there is literally zero evidence that either of them mined a single block, despite that evidence being **exceedingly** easy to proffer. (Instead, he tries to prove his involvement in [less convincing]( ways.) In fact, almost all the bitcoin addresses Craig claimed to own have been shown to belong to others. And as for Dave, like I said, there's no evidence he had any relationship to bitcoin, let alone mined it.


I beg to differ. This is an unsubstantiated claim. He appears to have deleted some of his blogs/linkedin/etc., but not before the majority of it was captured on archives. To believe that he managed to get **any and all** incriminating evidence before 2013 is a bit of a stretch. 


Can you elaborate on this? This is the first I'm hearing about it.


Sure, but 1) Nick is far from proven to be Satoshi, 2) he had an incredibly strong interest in digital money pre-dating Satoshi (where Craig's interests were almost completely unrelated), and 3) his **overall** blog output was practically nil during the Satoshi period. So it's not like he was ignoring Bitcoin specifically. Finally, at least Szabo got the spelling right, unlike Craig (multiple times!).

@_date: 2018-05-31 00:06:39


I truly do appreciate that.


Fair enough, but my confidence that Szabo is Satoshi is low (~10%) anyway.


Why do that when he claimed to have the keys to the first nine blocks? (I know you're not defending the claim, but it just rings false to me.)


Thanks for the theories. I don't see how this would have helped there, though. 


Yeah, I tried to slog through it as well. Like almost all of Craig's stuff, it was unremarkable. 
I've tried to compile a timeline of publicly available events related to Craig's claim. I've pasted it [here]( if you don't mind taking a look. If there's anything notably absent, or incorrect, please let me know. (Also, I don't have an exact date for the 'leak' - I assume you have better information there.)
Edit: Also, can you make heads or tails of Craig's [sworn affidavit]( from October 31, 2013 where he claimed that he controlled an address that's [almost certainly not his]( This is over a year before any 'leak'.
Edit 2: If you 'discouraged him' from certain things, I assume you have some personal contact with him. Can you ask him why he didn't do something like [this]( or whether he can do it for you now?
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:18:19


Do you find it odd that Ira only 'remembers' this conversation (that occurred almost 5 years previous) after Craig tells the remaining Kleimans that Dave was part of Satoshi? He apparently didn't even think about it after bitcoin had been in the news for *years*. Witness recollections are *notoriously unreliable*, especially for someone in a suggestible state. 
This lawsuit is completely based on them [attempting]( to get a settlement out of Craig or nChain:


They even admit that Dave and Craig being Satoshi is not critical to their case. 


One of? Are there any others? From what I can tell, there is *literally nothing* linking Kleiman to bitcoin other than this and Craig's fakery. 
Also, don't you find it odd that, despite Craig leaving elephant-sized digital footprints dating back to the pre-Satoshi era, the *only* stuff that's publicly verifiable that links him directly to bitcoin start in 2013, right around when he first started trading BTC on MtGox? (And there is a metric **ton** of it from that point (mostly faked, of course).) There's even a smattering of 'Bit Coin' mentions previous to that, but only in ways that make it clear that he doesn't have real interest in it.
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:24:05
Many transactions will be created to spend the 0.01BTC, but only one will make it to the blockchain. It's just a simple experiment to see which one will make it. Will it be the one with the highest mining fee? I expect the transactions to enter the system from different nodes. Which will win?

@_date: 2014-03-11 18:38:36
Right, I get that this is how it works currently. But imagine that I'm a miner and I see one transaction with a 0.0002BTC fee and then an otherwise valid one with a 0.0003BTC fee. I'd prefer the latter. If someone sent that transaction **directly to the mining pool** which used a modified client that accepted that type of transaction, it would work just fine if they mined the next block. 
I also understand TX priority, but those are guidelines. Once a block is mined, other clients won't  reject it if it didn't follow TX priority guidelines.
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:04:18
[This]( is a decent starting point for an explain-like-I'm-five version of the Bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:04:34
A hash function takes any number and turns it into a number in a certain range (0 to 2^256 -1 in Bitcoin's case). If you use the same initial number, the 'hashed' number will be the same, but if you use a different initial number, the 'hashed' number will be different. 
Example: 
hash(283) = 23777203982
hash(284) = 9837403792814839
Hashes are often called 'one way' because it's normally impossible to guess what the first number was by looking at the 'hashed' number. In this example, you can't guess that the input number was 283 if you were only told that the output number was 23777203982.
So with Bitcoin, the miners are trying to get an output number lower than a certain threshold. Say that threshold is 5000 (this is the 'difficulty' in the Bitcoin protocol). They have to keep trying numbers until they get a number such that hash(num) &lt; 5000. For example, they try the number 3829. They see that hash(3829) = 2770, so that means they won! They show everyone their number (3829) and everyone sees that its hash is below 5000, so they 'win' this block.
Now, they don't just get to pick any number they want to try. The current 'block' they're trying to solve has a structure where they can change a few things about it. Since the block is just binary data, it is actually just a big number. But they can change parts of it. (The nonce, etc).
Imagine that the underlying block binary data (in decimal) is: 90007000283720. They are only free to change the '7000' part, ie (9000**7000**283720). So they keep trying hash(9000700**1**283720), then hash(9000700**2**283720), then hash(9000700**3**283720), then hash(9000700**4**283720). All of those hash values were over 5000. Eventually, they see that hash(9000**7355**283720) = 4809. That's less than 5000, so they show everyone their number and collect their bitcoins.
Note I'm using much smaller numbers for simplicity. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:57:03
Thanks for the feedback. I did expect this outcome, but sometimes experiments are fun even if they yield the expected result. If any miners were using custom clients that replaced transactions in their pools with ones with higher fees, then the result would've been interesting. I expect that will be the default sometime in the future. Otherwise, miners are just leaving money on the table.
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:45:12
I think you're a little too optimistic about the ability to track the purported hackers via the blockchain. [Mixing services]( (tumblers) can make it nearly impossible to trace bitcoins. Of course, it would be much harder to mix 750k BTC, but if the hackers did it over an extended period of time, it would still work.

From my perspective, the conclusion that Ver 'lied' is an overreach. It's possible that he did knowingly spread misinformation (ie - he did lie), but I think the more likely explanation is that he was repeating what he'd read elsewhere, as he claimed in his btc post. 
*However*, I personally find that behavior unacceptable given his position in the community. He has a responsibility to verify these facts for himself rather than just pick up the local mud and sling it. And rather than acknowledge his mistake, he doubled down and accused Wirdum of ['twisting the truth'](  I try to apply that standard to both sides.

A soft fork makes the rules for valid blocks *more restrictive*. That is, all blocks after the soft fork are still valid under the old rules. However, there now will be a set of blocks which *would have been accepted* under the old rules, but will now be rejected. 
So your last sentence is right in a certain way. Miners **must** follow the new, more restrictive rules for blocks. However, they can still mine blocks that don't contain any segwit transactions (but they still must mark segwit compatibility, AFAIK. EDIT: this does not appear to be the case. Version bits for soft forks are unset once the fork is Active according to BIP 9).

This isn't really an optimization though. It's an exploit of a weakness in the current bitcoin protocol. It basically lets you do SHA 1.5 times instead of 2 times, like the protocol intended. So the choice is to just let this keep happening, and 'freeze' the coinbase, which would prevent SegWit along with a whole host of other potential upgrades to the protocol, or stop it and keep the proof of work working as intended.

It's incompatible with the upgrades I'm talking about. So if all miners used this 'optimization', it would block those upgrades.

Maybe in this sub, but there are a **ton** of true believers in &gt; So I wonder if CSW was in some way connected to SN, or at least knew who he was, and therefore knew that he would not be able to respond for some reason.
I think the more likely explanation is that he realized Satoshi had been gone a while and hadn't moved coins, so it was just a calculated risk. 


Not that I know of, and not that I'd trust anyway since there'd be no way to check with Hal. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:17:34
It's *much harder* to prove something like "Kleiman didn't have C++ skills". Most people don't, so the default assumption is that he didn't have the skills. But it would be *very easy* to rebut that assumption by providing a sample of his work or something that indicates he had those skills. 
If it helps, read the other post as "there's no indication" instead of "he absolutely didn't".
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:27:23


Nope. It’s just a calculated risk. And the truth **is** out: he’s a fraud. And lo and behold, he still has true believers. 


Why would the real Satoshi care? Craig is already a laughingstock for 90+% of the bitcoin world. 


And I’m certain that you won’t actually show your evidence, so it’s worthless. 


I haven’t seen any evidence that Craig had even **heard** of bitcoin prior to 2011. So, yes, there is denying. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:54:43


If one chain gets like 99% of the hashrate for a few weeks, it's pretty clear that this chain will be considered 'bitcoin'. 


I don't see it happening, but it's possible. 


The miners and economic majority will decide. Hopefully, after a short time, nearly everyone will be on the same chain. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:13:38




@_date: 2017-09-20 14:39:35
I haven't considered every possibility, but I think there's higher potential of chain re-orgs, causing your transaction to disappear even if it gets confirmed in a few blocks. Imagine if there was a fairly even split of hashrate, but S2X had marginally more. If you sent a transaction and it got picked up in a S2X block only, and even got confirmed a few times. Now imagine that the non-S2X chain increased their hashrate. Now all miners will build on the non-S2X chain (since all non-S2X blocks are valid to S2X miners, but not vice-versa), and the blocks your transaction got included in now get orphaned. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:31:52

Same here, but Craig is a horse of a different color, so to speak.
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:26:24
As a strict holder, it probably won't affect you much other than price changes due to uncertainty or something. However, if the S2X fork becomes the de-facto 'bitcoin' according to the economic majority, you may have to change wallets. (This is **far** from clear, though. In fact, most here think this is *highly* unlikely, or even impossible.)
The difference between this situation and the BCH fork is that the BCH fork included replay protection. If you made a transaction in BTC, it wouldn't show up in BCH's blockchain, and vice versa. In this case, if there is no replay protection, any transaction you attempt to send could be included in either (or both) blockchains, if they differ. Some people think that S2X will dominate the hashrate and therefore become the default 'bitcoin', since unmodified SPV nodes will follow the strongest chain. Others (including many here), think that even if it gets more hashrate, it will still not be 'bitcoin' since the blocks will not be valid according to (non-S2X) full nodes.

I have more than that. In addition to him being a proven liar:
* Wrong time zone to be Satoshi
* No evidence that CSW can code
* Writing style completely different
* Financial motivation to claim to be Satoshi
* Lost a bet on a simple technical question related to bitcoin mining
* No evidence of his even having *heard* of bitcoin before around 2014
In short, I'd bet more money on a *random programmer* being Satoshi than I would on CSW being Satoshi. And there are thousands of programmers.


This is bizarre. So you're saying I can't prove that a (now) ten year old child isn't Satoshi? Your standards of proof are ... nonstandard.
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:13:31


Yeah, not really sure. My best guess is that it means all blocks are under 4MB weight. Maybe they'd say bitcoin is *more compatible* because it has stricter rules, though this is a strange argument.


Not that I've seen, but since they appear to have implemented [opt-in replay protection]( won't any block that has a 'forbidden' transaction be invalid from the 2X point of view? So any user that gets such a transaction into a bitcoin block will force a fork, right? It makes my above scenario even more unlikely.
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:53:02
Good question for specifically. I suspect (though have no proof) that he has financial ties to Craig or nChain, so he's taking the coward's way out and refusing to give his opinion of CSW, even though he has one. It's a morally bankrupt position.

It wouldn't necessarily mean the coins would be lost forever. If you were the *spender* of the coins, you'd just see them back in your wallet. However, if you were the *receiver*, they would no longer be in your wallet, and would reappear back in the wallet of the sender. You (or the sender) could potentially rebroadcast the same transaction and force them back into your wallet, but if they were already sent to someone else in the (now re-orged) chain, you'd be out of luck and wouldn't be able to get them back. It's an unlikely scenario, but it's not impossible. 
Edit: I think the bottom line is that you'll want to wait a bit to see how things work out before you start sending and receiving transactions. Or at least wait until many confirmations to consider a transaction 'safe'.

He was deep in debt and took a calculated risk. If the real Satoshi came out, he wouldn't be much worse off.

This is not fabricating things? Did you see her example? 
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:27:35
Craig Wright is a serial fabricator and liar. Here's just some of the evidence:
1. He faked [blog posts](
2. He faked [PGP keys](
3. He faked [contracts and emails](
4. He faked [threats]( 
5. He faked [a public key signing](
6. He has a [well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related]( (see numbers 88 through 102)
7. His own mother [admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things](
And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:
1. He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
2. He is not [technically competent]( in the subject matter
3. His [writing style]( is nothing like [Satoshi's](
4. He [called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011]( when Satoshi never used a space
5. He [actively bought and traded coins]( from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
6. He was [paid millions]( for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive

[No way he wrote it](
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:35:16


He literally made things up out of whole cloth. Comparing my paraphrasing of her quote for brevity to concocting a story is pretty lame.

Aren't those posts the ones he edited the timestamps for? They're originally from April 2008 and December 2005. Compare the URL and timestamp on the page: [
This makes it more likely (IMO) that he's Satoshi. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:19:13
It really could be several different explanations. We don't even know if we have the full, correct story of what happened. It's like trying to figure out a magic trick based on a description from an audience member. 
One plausible theory is that they used a modified WiFi to download a custom version of Electrum.

In order to generate the same amount of new bitcoins at the same rate as today, you'd have to solve hundreds or thousands of blocks every 10 minutes. This would be a giant waste of bandwidth and processing power. It would make the orphan rate enormous, and generally make the blockchain unstable.

Jesus Christ those links are trash. I don't have a strong opinion on Tesla, but those articles are tabloid-level bullshit. Did you read the one from 2015? [Here's]( a quick rebuttal to that garbage.

Shocking that someone who went to the trouble of using a pseudonym would not willingly identify himself.


I wouldn't put too much weight on nationality here, especially for someone who used the pseudonym of *Satoshi Nakamoto*!
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:54:19


OK, bud. I said those links are trash, then gave an example of their trashiness. How's that ad hominem?


Nice ad hominem, buddy ;)


You really think it makes sense to use that metric (net loss averaged per car sold) to determine the viability of a new car company? Oh my poor dear child.
@_date: 2017-07-07 01:44:53
No. Zero evidence for that. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:23:34
No prob!

Szabo's reaction around 1:50.

Comment didn't age well, did it?

I would imagine his claim to be Satoshi.

The lady doth protest too much, methinks.

It's pretty clear that Satoshi was in the Eastern or Central time zone, though, from the metadata on the whitepaper and the timing of his forum posts.
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:36:57
You read wrong. See [here]( and [here]( Also, a few months before the whitepaper came out, he [posted]( that he had some time for freelance work, and included "software architecture and engineering" as one of his skills.

Nick Szabo had known Hal Finney since at least 1993. Either Hal Finney made up a bunch of emails back and forth between himself, or he was corresponding to someone who wanted to remain anonymous. I think the more likely scenario is that Hal suggested to Nick to use that name as a pseudonym (if indeed that's where the name came from).
