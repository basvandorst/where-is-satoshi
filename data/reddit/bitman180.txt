Good job for the beginning, but I wish that in the near future Microsoft will keep the coins and pay their employees with bitcoin. That will be a perfect and complete use of bitcoin.

Why go through all the trouble with banks when you can use for example Cryptocapital for this matter and not be limited only to the UK or even Europe.
Cryptocurrency related business should support others by using their services and not, like in this case, going back using a limiting banking system.

That was the most pathetic video I have ever seen!
All that was said against cryptocurrency were actually the flaws that the credit cards have.
