I posted this further down in the comments, but I think this might be a good start for the design: 
I'm sure since you're a graphic designer you can come up with something a little bit more eye catching than this. Maybe italics? I don't know. Go at it! :D

Not yet. I need to find a reputable graphic designer to come up with a design. I've been playing around with a couple ideas in my head though. Any suggestions you'd like to put forth?

Hey, thanks! I'll try to get the message out enough where we can raise money. Spread the word!!

I'll message you after posting this comment, but I didn't think about going for smaller, but more advertisements, but think about the audience. Bus stops are typically used by people of lower tier incomes, and would really have no idea / interest in using Bitcoin. A large advertisement on one of our two main high ways (I-71 and I-75) would reach more people who would be interested, than those who, for example, ride the bus.
Just a thought about getting a large one rather than many small ones.

Yeah, simple is definitely the idea. We don't want to have a billboard with a whole paragraph of writing. I was thinking about the Bitcoin logo, with "What is Bitcoin?" Next to it in large letters. Then a find out more part, with the addresses for Bitcoin.org and Weusecoins.com under it.
here is visual representation about what I'm talking about. (note: this is not the final decision!!!!!!!)
