Uh, your paper wallet assessment is a bit shaky, but you really lost me at this bit. Trezor, Ledger etc are extremely quick and easy to use, and I've yet to hear a single case of someone actually losing coins on one - only highly theoretical attacks.

I don't think the government has thought this through very well. Half of Americans live paycheck to paycheck and are unaffected. The rest will do *anything* to preserve their wealth. For the rich, you've got tax havens, offshore accounts, insurance policies and dummy companies. For the middle class, usually the stock market or real estate, but both are seriously overbought and approaching bubble territory again. If banks start charging people for deposits, a safe full of cash would be fine for most people. 
If cash was outlawed, you could hoard another country's cash, or gold or jewelry. Anything that holds its value over time - art, land, home improvements, collectibles, vintage cars. 
As you continue to squeeze people, that wealth just goes elsewhere. People would start growing their own food, raising chickens, and bartering for goods and services more. Hell, a $100 Amazon gift card is essentially the same as $100 for most people.

"We really like this Bitcoin thing, but we noticed it puts us out of a job, so we're going to call it 'blockchain tech' and add in some regulation, oversight, laws, inflation schedule, KYC and set ourselves up as middlemen - for your safety of course, and for a small fee.

Eh, I just get the impression that people have factored in the cost/risk of exchanges exit scamming. 
If you can get in and make 2-3x your money margin trading/shorting over six months and get *most* of your profit off the exchange before the CEO replaces your Bitcoins with tokens and retires to the Caribbean, you still come out ahead. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:15:47
I feel like a broken record, but if you just want Bitcoins and aren't a margin-trader:
 - Buy small amounts on Coinbase or Circle on dips, transfer the coins to your own hardware/software/paper wallet as they arrive in your account.
 - Do the same thing in reverse on spikes to sell. Transfer small amounts, wait for them to clear in your bank account.
The worst that can happen here is losing one 'small amount' if you're super unlucky and an exchange goes belly up in the middle of a transfer. I've had zero issues in four years, and due to cost averaging I'm still profitable even having bought quite a few coins in the run up to $1200.

I agree with the points about 'confidence' which points towards markets and [supply/demand]( but I never really understood why people get hung up on the terms 'money' and 'currency' and have to have a debate about money vs stocks vs bonds vs commodities... 
Humans crave objectivity, but many things are subjective/based on the observer, and many systems are massively interconnected and complicated. [Nothing has 'intrinsic value'](
How about we just stick to 'value'? In a [free market]( something (dollars, euros, oil, stocks, bonds, gold, cars, bitcoins, tulips, Beanie Babies, carrots, houses, baseball cards) is worth what someone is willing to pay for it.

I think people should just assume *software* wallets are always at risk of being compromised at any time, and just keep small amounts (&lt; $200) on phones. In a year or two we'll see a story about a hacker that can sweep coins from iPhones via NFC just by walking by strangers on the street. 
If you have an amount of BtC where if you lost it you'd start punching holes in drywall, it needs to be on a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger) or for the utterly paranoid, in cold storage in a paper wallet in a safe somewhere.

Which means you don't own that money, your bank does. Ask the people of Cyprus what that could mean for your deposits in the event of a bail-in. If you're in the US, Google 'Glass-Steagall'. 
The main advantage of Bitcoin isn't that it's digital - it's that it's a digital bearer instrument. Bitcoin is the first currency outside the control of central banks and governments. They can't inflate away your purchasing power with negative interest rates, endless quantitative easing or money printing/bailouts given to banks and the 1%. 
As long as you have an internet connection you, and you alone, have access to your wealth. It can't be seized, taxed, frozen or skimmed without access to your private keys.

Nailed it. I'd add protection from money-printing as a key use case as well. 
It's going to be very, very clear over the next 2-4 years that the world's central banks and governments have absolutely every intention of inflating themselves out of the current [100%+ debt to GDP deficit]( every country is running. 
People with an understanding of wealth (vs money) are going to take every precaution possible to preserve their stored wealth.

The masses are, by definition, not early adopters. Coinbase alone has 3.5 million geeks, Libertarians, gold bugs and techies that are interested and buying enough to keep the price stable at a 9.68% inflation rate. Which will (drum roll) halve in three months.

@_date: 2016-04-05 17:32:00
Right. For those that need to be caught up to speed:
1) Bitcoin - a digital currency is created to remove trusted third parties. You can now send value directly over the internet to a recipient. 
2) Commercial/investment banks, brokerages and insurance companies realize this disintermediates them as middlemen, destroying one aspect of their business model.
3) The companies decide to band together create their own cryptocurrency where they're still needed as a trusted third party, preserving their status as middlemen, and business model (ability to take a cut of all transactions).

Yeah, it's weird when I think this through. 
If the idea is a publicity stunt for Bitcoin, then you sort of need to get caught so the media does a whole Op-Ed piece on it and the libertarian billionaires see Bitcoin as a useful tech. But if you get caught the perception is 'Oh, this guy broke the law smuggling money, Bitcoin doesn't help there, they still track you.' 
We'd need someone to successfully transfer the million and then... afterwards admit to breaking money transmission laws? Maybe they can transfer to/from a country that doesn't have laws restricting money transfer? Do they exist?

That means the market has been optimistic (bullish) for the past year and a half, unless you're going to suggest the price crash wasn't due to MTGox losing 650,000 coins and was instead caused by people selling due to the blocksize limit.

So, first question: The Bitcoin blockchain is trustless by design - how is Tierion 'anchoring' files to the blockchain such that we don't have to trust them not to edit/modify/delete files? 
Second: they're centralized, a single point of failure. If Tierion goes bankrupt, local government seizes their servers, an employee goes rogue and deletes everything, do I still have access to everything I've 'anchored'? 
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:09:37


(Arguably) the reason the price is spiking is due to several solutions on the very near horizon - SegWit, Lightning Network, Schnorr Signatures and an old-fashioned block size increase. If any one of these pans out you're looking at a doubling of capacity, if they all work out... 
By the time we know for certain the capacity has increased, the market will have already priced it in (it's too late to make money on that cycle, and you're back to day trading).

Solid overview here. Personally I stopped reading at:
"Corda has no native cryptocurrency"
I.e this has nothing to do with markets, currency, money, central banks, cryptocurrencies, altcoins, etc. It's Bitcoin minus the thing it was solving for in the first place (open, distributed, trustless) while   leaning as heavily as possible on 'blockchain' as a the new hotness marketing buzzword du jour.

I don't think this sub realizes the sheer amount of *money* that these banks/companies can bring to the table to fight Bitcoin if they decide it's a serious threat to their business model (which becomes more likely as the price rises). Trillions, with a 't'. 
That money can/will be spent on:
 - Building competing products (private blockchains)
 - Lobbying Congress for protectionist laws
 - Discrediting/purchasing/attacking companies using Bitcoin, crypto exchanges and our developers (hiring a long-standing developer and having them say Bitcoin is a failed project is a bargain at twice the price) 
 - Marketing/advertising about how R3 is the greatest innovation in FinTech since the credit card, and campaigns/articles about how Bitcoin is used only by drug addicts/pedophiles/terrorists 
 - Hackers to bring down dark net markets, companies and exchanges to show Bitcoin isn't 'safe' to try and herd people into bank-approved ETFs or Coinbase/Circle (see also: Ransomware)
 - Other, weirder, shadier things that won't come to light for years

I've posted this guy once a year for two years now, might as well repost for the newbs for 2018.
Seriously guys, avoid day-trading. There's a reason HODL is a meme here. You can agonize over if Ethereum is syphoning off market share, the DAO will impact prices, exchanges going offline, governments outlawing it, pending scaling upgrades, private bankcoins, hacks, thefts, political forking and overhyped alts all you want, it's all just noise. The concept is solid, proven, but adoption takes time.
The way you make money is to wait for the next spike, i.e. years. We've had ~~three~~ ~~four~~ five major 10x (or higher) bubbles and crashes. I stressed and theorized like crazy watching things crash from $214 down to $88. I had friends call me up yelling/crying because they lost thousands of dollars, panicked and sold, and friends who thought they were geniuses making an extra $400 timing a dip... and it was an utter waste of time and effort. The two friends that don't handle stress well sold around $100 after chewing me out on the phone, and then watched in horror as Bitcoin went from $90 to $1150.
The friends that did a little research, bought what they could and just went on with their life, not checking the chart every day, assuming I'd let them know if something interesting happened made a lot of money. (Ok, to be fair here, one got Gox'd.)
Bitcoin is still in relatively few hands. These whales wait for anything resembling bad news and cause 20% crashes to buy in lower. Ignore it. Get off r/bitcoin and go play video games and drink and try new restaurants and stuff. The next spike is coming.
Carry on. :)

Good stuff all around.
22:43 Max Keiser: "Give me some good news on Bitcoin."
Richard Heart: "Bitcoin is the only product that has good, legal backing. So there's laws which specifically name Bitcoin that allow you to get banking relationships with it, to get good custodial services for instance through Gemini, where a larger institution could purchase a bunch of Bitcoin and have an licensed, insured, bonded reason to believe it couldn't get stolen or hacked. Other cryptocurrencies don't have that. We also have CME futures, the largest market on the planet, the CBOE which does about a quarter of the volume, which is still quite amazing, we have the best developers in the entire world working on this, the first mover advantage, the greatest liquidity, the most secure platform, software that isn't buggy, really works, doesn't have emergency down targeting problems like the fake impostors have had, and a few problems, like a unit bias problem where people want to own a single coin, and since millibits isn't popular, they choose things like Litecoin or BCash because they're 'cheaper' and that puts Bitcoin at a disadvantage."

You've added some negative spin, but what you've described is called a 'free market' and they're actually awesome. Something (dollars, euro, stocks, bonds, houses, cars, gold) is worth exactly what someone is willing to pay for it. 
Most of the markets above are manipulated to some extent. Bitcoin has no interest rates for the Fed to tweak, and a fixed supply cap that can't be 'quantitatively eased' inflating your value away. It's worth what the market thinks it is (currently 88% more than a year ago).

They absolutely get the point. They want everyone to think that Bitcoin is for insane terrorists, hackers and virtual drug dealers, but that their own privately controlled R3 blockchain is safe, secure, warm, fuzzy and downright patriotic to use. 
Also, they'll control those private keys for you, because blockchain/DLT is really complicated. You don't want to mistype something and lose all your money do you? They'll peg it to the every-inflating fiat currencies, dole out your money when you need a little, charge interest, monthly fees, transfer fees and everything can proceed as usual. 
Add in a few billion in advertising/marketing talking about how the banks have revolutionized FinTech, and some cool news segment talks with bought-out developers on Fox News and CNN talking about how Bitcoin was just a test-run, a proof of concept, but this new R3 tech is the *real deal*. 
This game plan has been in place for years now. If they can get enough people to believe this crap narrative, they can stay relevant and not have their entire industry get Ubered. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:36:23


Really good question. We don't know - like everything in economics, it's super messy/complicated/interrelated. Historically, as transactions per day has gone up, price has gone up, which makes sense, that's basic adoption. Likewise we see price dips  when exchanges are hacked, negative press is released, competitors start building private blockchains, altcoin pumps, developers rage quit, etc. 
Overall though, it seems clear that more capacity means more adopters means higher prices. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 21:57:23


Yeah, that's true. In the process though, an awful lot of people lost their life savings - the stored equivalent of years of hard work.

I'm curious how you're measuring that statement, I'm assuming there's a strict economic definition. The stock market is reaching all-time highs for sure, but 90% of stocks are controlled by the wealthy elite. 
For contrast, a few quick stats (I'm in the US):
 - [50%]( of households make $30k a year or less
 - [1 in 5]( households have no members actively working
 - [47%]( of all Americans do not put a single penny out of their paychecks into savings.
 - For each of the past six years, [more businesses have closed than have opened]( This has never happened before in US history.
 - According to the New York Times, the typical American household is now worth [36%]( less than it was worth a decade ago.
 - For those Americans that don’t own a home, [1 in 4]( spend more than 50% of their paycheck on rent and utilities.
 - [43%]( of people with student loans aren't paying them at the moment.
And so on. I'm sure there are stats out there showing GPD growth, low inflation and so on, so it's possibly to say 'we're not in a recession' but in general, since 2007, the middle class is getting utterly wiped out. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:39:40


Fair question. I guess it depends on the degree of collapse. If it's a massive worldwide default on on that mountain of debt, Great Depression style, then yes, like the Great Depression hedging outside of fiat will still help. Many people throughout history made their fortunes in such times. 
If it's more of a zombie apocalypse, complete infrastructure style collapse, with the internet and electricity grids down, food shortages and Mad Max style roving gangs of mutants, then no, of course not. Only the insane preppers in their underground bunkers stocked with MRE rations, antibiotics and bullets will get the last laugh.

I posted this half a year ago, might be helpful - 
I've explained Bitcoin many times to people, and when it goes awry, reactions fall into three buckets:
**1) They don't understand what money is/how it works.**
I once explained inflation to someone - 'Whoa, you don't have a 401k, do you realize that if you just keep cash in a bank, you're slowly losing money?' They looked at me like I'm insane, and I had to go 'Ok, when I was in elementary school, chocolate milk was $0.35. Now it's a dollar. Why the difference?'
If you're starting there, you can stop. That person isn't going to understand currency vs gold vs stocks, inflation, markets, let alone Bitcoin. That's hours of explaining how the world works just to get to Bitcoin - nobody has the interest or patience for a six hour lecture on economics.
**2) They don't understand the tech.**
Everything in software can be copied. Your cat photos live on your iPhone, your iMac, the Mac's external Time Machine backup, iCloud, Dropbox, in gMail attachments... the idea of a piece of data that can't be copied is not intuitive.
If they're tech savvy, you can spend 10-15 minutes explaining basic cryptography, mining, blockchains and so on, and if you do a good job, they'll get it. If you're getting questions like 'What about software bugs?' 'What if it's hacked?' and 'Can I mine for them?' you're on the right track. If they're glazing over, it's too much in one go or you're explaining it poorly. Then they walk away thinking it's basically World of Warcraft gold (which I did too at one point).
**3) They think the government will stomp it into oblivion any second now.**
These guys have a solid grasp of everything so far, also believe the government has an absolute stranglehold on wealth/value, and refuse to think there's any way around that. The government is an omnipotent shadow society of guys with guns and black vans that you absolutely do not screw with, and they hate Bitcoin. With these guys, you need to explain that Bitcoin isn't illegal, we have legit exchanges like Coinbase and it isn't just in the US, it's in every country. It could be outlawed, but then again, so was BitTorrent and music/movie sharing, and that isn't going so well either.
With these guys you're generally fighting public perception. Remember the media spent about two years associating Bitcoin with the 'deep web', dark net markets, drugs, contract killing and so on. It's only in 2015 they shifted over to 'oh well, a lot of new companies are actually investing in it now, interesting.'
If you explain poorly with this group you come off as a weird fringe libertarian anarchist type.

This. You can't cook the books on a country-wide scale with a transparent ledger thousands of people worldwide run copies of.

For the long-time holders, we've seen this so many times we barely bat an eye. We're up 1,000% percent in 2017, and are now experiencing a 50% drop from the all-time high. I had friends freaking the hell out out in the $32 -&gt; $2 drop, and again in the $260 -&gt; $80 drop, and another batch of people in the $1100 -&gt; $300 drop, and now... after five 10x (or higher) bubbles and drops you have news articles with writers that are just *convinced* it's all over now? Spend a little time reading the [hundreds of articles]( predicting Bitcoin's demise from CNBC, Newsweek, Wired, Techcrunch, Washington Post, Bloomberg, etc etc.

For me as well. Future generations of children are going to ask their teacher "Why were people ok with having 2-4% of their money stolen from them every year via inflation?"

[Governments]( could slow it down by outlawing or putting extreme KYC/regulations on the exchanges, but there's really no way they can stop it any more than they can stop file sharing or torrents. You can send transactions over satellite, SMS and TOR now. 
At this point crypto is basically a financial [prisoner's dilemma]( on a global scale. Countries, like Japan, that embrace cryptocurrency are going to leapfrog ahead, countries that attempt to ban it will miss out on what's arguably the largest fintech revolution in 50 years.

Apologies to all the altcoin fans, but it's just not a useful metric.

I think people on this forum will be surprised at just how much wrath a fully mobilized US can bring to try and fight an actual competitor to the petrodollar. If the US was willing to fabricate stories about 'weapons of mass destruction' to invade and destabilize other country's governments to secure control of oil, they'll absolutely be willing to scoop up Gemini or Coinbase under the auspices of 'national security'.

It's painful listening to this. As someone who's been in the space since 2013, it's rough listening to Congressmen get basic things wrong about cryptocurrencies (assume they're the equivalent to digital dollars) forget that they're global (assume they can be easily regulated, because of course the US can regulate anything it wants) and not understand why they're better than a bank account (they don't understand the massive savings involved in having computers automate manual banking procedures, or circumvent taxes and fees). 
On the plus side, they're probably going to spend the next few years arguing about how to regulate Facebook and Libra, which has volunteered to throw itself under the regulatory bus. In the meantime, Bitcoin will continue its slow, worldwide digesting of fiat, one dollar, euro, yen, peso and yuan at a time.

Seriously guys, avoid day-trading. There's a reason HODL is a meme here. You can agonize over if Ethereum is syphoning off market share, the DAO will impact prices, exchanges going offline, governments outlawing it, pending scaling upgrades, private blockchains, hacks, thefts, political forking and venture capital all you want, it's all just noise. The concept is solid, proven, but adoption takes time.
The way you make money is to wait for the next spike, i.e. years. We've had four major 10x (or higher) bubbles and crashes. I stressed and theorized like crazy watching things crash from $214 down to $88. I had friends call me up yelling/crying because they lost thousands of dollars, panicked and sold, and friends who thought they were geniuses making an extra $400 timing a dip... and it was an utter waste of time and effort. The two friends that don't handle stress well sold around $100 after chewing me out on the phone, and then watched in horror as Bitcoin went from $90 to $1150.
The friends that did a little research, bought what they could and just went on with their life, not checking the chart every day, assuming I'd let them know if something interesting happened made a lot of money. (Ok, to be fair here, one got Gox'd.)
Bitcoin is still in relatively few hands. These whales wait for anything resembling bad news and cause 20% crashes to buy in lower. Ignore it. Get off r/bitcoin and go play video games and drink and try new restaurants and stuff. The next spike is coming.
Carry on. :)
EDIT: TL;DR: HODL

That's about the size of it. Satoshi built Bitcoin around greed, with each system relying on self-interest. Miners aren't going to 51% attack, and holders aren't going to push through software updates that could destroy their own investment.

That's fair, and it wasn't my intention. I've edited my comment and put it in. My original point about fiat being as much a confidence game as crypto stands though, moreover I think Chamath *wanted* viewers to think about currencies in that way. 


I disagree, I think crypto is a massive improvement simply because it's a fixed supply. I firmly believe money-printing [causes wealth disparity]( Yes, I realize that's a rabbit hole of a discussion involving Keynesian versus Austrian economics. Obviously I'm in the second group.

You’re skipping over the most crucial part here: shortly after the housing/financial crisis, caused by these CDOs, the government went on to print *$90 billion a month* for three years i.e. [quantitative easing]( inflating the value of the dollar and effectively [robbing everyone]( who held dollars of their purchasing power. 
With Bitcoin, you can’t inflate the supply, it’s permanently capped at 21 million coins. The people making those bad loans would pay for their poor decision and business, not everyday citizens. This mission statement is embedded as a link (Chancellor on Brink if Second Round of Bailouts) in Bitcoin’s [genesis block]( to remind people why it was created in the first place.

My fear as well. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to free an entire generation of wages slaves toiling away for imaginary funbucks. The thing I worry about is that system may not be due to some oppressive regime hell-bent on enslaving, but just human nature, i.e. 'the machine' is just giving people what they want, Chipotle burritos and Netflix. 
I heard the same arguments about the Internet in the 90's, how it was going to revolutionize everything, open communication, free information, everyone can be a news outlet, equality, etc. Then given twenty years, people gravitate towards watching porn and funny cat videos, liking photos of waffles on Instagram and tweet wars about which corporation was the most racist this week. 
Give humans highly advanced tech if you want, they're still humans. With Bitcoin, we've started down the path of toppling central bank's stranglehold on wealth and money printing, and still a not insignificant number of people in here are still going 'yeah, but when's the stupid ETF, I want muh Lambo' and posting memes.

It shocks me how much people are willing to talk about how crypto, a $500 billion market cap is 'like, totally a bubble', but they're unwilling to talk about 70 years of kicking the can down the road as monetary policy.
The root problem here is the top-heavy nature of society due to the baby boomer generation. They're retiring in one gigantic lump, punching a massive hole in the economy. With productivity decreasing, everyone panics because without that 2% growth, that [$20.5 trillion in debt]( becomes a massive freaking problem. We've been printing money and strangling the life out of the younger generations. The elephant in the room is: you have two choices, the debt must [default]( or the [value of the currency]( must be destroyed. 
There isn't anything we can do but ride it out over the next ~20 years. (As a whole) people are going to have to get used to a drop in standard of living. Quantitative easing [increases wealth disparity]( and creates asset bubbles. Stocks are [absurdly priced]( at the moment. [NIRP]( punishes savers and the [War on Cash]( is going to pan out much like the War on Drugs - i.e. police raids, only they take your safe instead of your pot, or just [outlaw higher denomination bills]( People with any sense will store wealth elsewhere - overseas, precious metals, (cough) Bitcoin, collectibles, art etc.
People are also switching to services instead of purchases: [renting instead of owning]( bartering, cooking instead of eating out, Uber and a bike instead of owning a car, Netflix instead of cable, [delaying marriage]( and kids, [living with their parents]( or with five smelly roommates and so on, i.e. a lot of the stuff Millennials have already figured out.
Markets will crash regardless of all these antics, much of this debt will default, the elite will scoop up 'real' assets at bargain-basement fire sale prices, and things will slowly recover. But it's going to be a while.
Given this backdrop, is it any wonder there's a ridiculous demand for Bitcoin driving transaction fees through the roof? Those fees are basically lifeboat tickets for a Titanic that's within visual range of that iceberg.

These products try to introduce trust back into a system that was expressly designed to remove the need for trust. It's as simple as that.

'Informed.' A nice way of saying "this is too complicated for you to understand, here's some research that favors my viewpoint." We have conflicting theories at the moment, and no data. There's no point in time we can point to and say "Bitcoin was too centralized here, and it broke x, y and z."
A lot of people on this forum have a hard time buying this premise, mostly because the original Satoshi limit was 32MB blocks.

So just so I'm following the logic here, you think Bitcoin is up 1160% from a year ago because of some combination of hype and branding? That it has no actual utility you know, moving massive amounts of money around the world outside the control of governments? Or as a hedge against inflation and poor monetary policy? Or as a way to pull wealth outside the banking system back into your own control? Or as a way to invest in a brand-new type of FinTech that's just starting, and will continue to innovate for years to come? 
If the counterargument is 'fees are too high', do you realize you can buy a million dollars worth of Bitcoin on Coinbase, sell a year later for massive profit and it never touches the blockchain?

Strictly speaking, nothing is ever ‘backed by’ anything, it’s a phrase used to give the impression something should hold its value. Unfortunately nothing has [intrinsic value]( 
If you want to switch to ‘what gives Bitcoin value?’ then it’s the same as anything: [supply and demand]( in the market. ‘Why the demand then?’ Some people collect bitcoins to protect themselves from inflation due to government policies of rampant money printing, some want the freedom to move money anywhere, instantly for pennies without needing ‘approval’ from authorities, or to avoid taxation and tariffs, and many collect bitcoins because they’ve rapidly increased in value over the past nine years, i.e. [speculating](

I appreciate the opinion here, it's a clear, logical presentation of the other side of the argument. Personally, I think that's fussing with semantics to fit an agenda. 
By example: 'Average Joe' is not fluent in technology, programming, blockchains or elliptical curve cryptography. He just bought as an investment, and has 3 Bitcoins on Coinbase. There's a hard fork raising the block size to 8MB. (Assuming) things rapidly settle down in a day or two as people flee the smaller fork. He logs onto Coinbase a week later and still has 3 Bitcoins. Not Litecoins or Dogecoins or an altcoin... Bitcoins. 
*Aside: In a worst-case scenario: if the assumption above is incorrect, several developers were indeed correct, users/miners/nodes were socially engineered to back a bad decision, and the hard fork utterly destroys Bitcoin. Well, then Satoshi shouldn't have created a system where the 51% wins, i.e. Bitcoin was flawed from the start.*
Hence the debate. Right now it feels like we're being censored from talking about Bitcoin's future, raising all sorts of questions about why, who benefits from preserving Bitcoin's current status quo, etc.

Uh, unless you're a bank, you're not invited to the party. In fact, even getting multiple banks to agree on a protocol, number of coins, inflation rate, initial premine distribution etc is probably impossible - they'll each make their *own* cryptocurrency only Chase or BoA can use. 
Meanwhile even the employees working on these projects will continue to tell the execs how innovating and forward-thinking they are... and quietly buy Bitcoins on the side.

I've always wondered about this. When someone makes a transaction, ~7 confirmations is considered 'extremely secure'. But for nodes, they need to download all 387,000 blocks to be sure? 
I would have thought the last 50-100 blocks would be more than enough. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:22:02


Clarification - Satoshi chose [33.5MB initially]( and dropped it to 1MB as spam prevention.
Quote from Satoshi:
*"It would be nice to keep the blk.dat files small as long as we can. The eventual solution will be to not care how big it gets. But for now, while it's still small, it's nice to keep it small so new users can get going faster. When I eventually implement client-only mode, that won't matter much anymore."*
The narrative of 'larger blocks threaten centralization' is a relatively new development. Just to give both sides of the issue equal airtime in this comment, here's a quote from Gregory Maxwell: 
*"Two years ago, there was a soft maximum size (initially put in by the system's creator) of 250kb where miners would accept blocks bigger than that but wouldn't create any bigger. Virtually no blocks were being made bigger than 250kb. Then Mike Hearn went and made public calls for people to switch to pools making larger blocks, and some pools started producing 500k. On the basis that there were many blocks over 250k, Bitcoin Core was changed to make that soft limit 750k.*
*Since then node count has decreased almost monotonically, and mining centralization has ramped WAY up-- right at the time of the change we went from the largest pools being 30% to the largest being nearly 50% hashrate. The changes in mining and node count sparked a bunch of frantic development trying to cut back on the disproportional advantage to larger miners, resulting in the invention of things like the relay network protocol, cutting delays out of Bitcoin Core and many other things.*
*We cannot be completely sure that this was causative, but it is very likely that it is at least somewhat causative. Simulation results show the same effects, and measurement on the network indicate there is a significant advantage to being higher hash-rate that goes up with larger blocks."*
Hence the blocksize debate. Decide for yourself.

You're jumping ahead a bit. Statistically with stocks, people cash out ~20% of their holdings each time it doubles (or halves).

Fair enough, lower level then: 
The transaction fee market isn't set (yet). Hypothetically, if a transaction costs $10, and doubling the block size cap would lower it to $5 by distributing the costs on to nodes as a bandwidth cost,  we should still consider that option, especially if we want to prioritize new user adoption over market price.

That's a big jump. Imagine if the US reduced inflation from ~3%/year to 1.5%/year. That difference compounds over time. 
Bitcoin is stable/increasing in price at 9% currently - halving the supply is equivalent to doubling demand. I think we're going to see at least a doubling in price (similar to the last halving).

We don't have to worry about this. If mining becomes less profitable, for any reason, the highest-margin miners drop out, the difficulty drops and it becomes more profitable for the remaining miners.

Look at it this way - Internet speeds increase by about 20-30% a year. I'm old, so I still remember waiting 30 seconds for a 30kb webpage to load over a 2400 baud modem. Twenty years later, I'm streaming Game of Thrones in 720p, my Mac is downloading Yosemite and I'm playing games on my phone on a $50/month connection. 
Unless you envision a population matching that growth rate  (~100 billion people on it 20 years from now) Bitcoin can and will scale. In the meantime, if Bitcoin grows quickly, people will have to compete for limited transactions somehow: transaction fees, lightning network, centralized services.

There's no 'stuffing' 1MB blocks - we approach that limit daily and chug along fine. Higher block sizes *may* slow down the network for nodes. 
Second, transactions didn't stop. The higher-fee transactions went through fine. The problem is wallets don't know what a 'higher fee' is at any given moment, they have fees hard coded in. So concern here in a worst-case scenario - you buy your PS4 from Best Buy, pay too small a fee and have to wait around four hours looking at DVDs waiting for your transaction to go through.
@_date: 2015-12-22 23:57:17
It's not a formula, is a trend. 
We *do* know that full blocks ratchet up fees as people compete for space. Raising the block size cap allows for more transactions and more users to enter the system. We have to push the limits as far as we can, for as long as we can. 
If we're really calling it quits at 1MB blocks because 'let the market decide' or whatever the reason, I think we're done. People can/will cash back out to fiat or maybe dump a little into larger block altcoins.

No sarcasm tag needed here. 
Their altcoin may help speed internal settlement between bank branches. If it's wildly successful, it might help settlement between banks, assuming they can come to an agreement regarding things like inflation rate, premine, initial distribution of coins, and so on, but it's probably possible.
What it can't be is open to everyone, free to innovate and build on, or decentralized.. governments won't allow that. 
Bitcoin was created as a reaction to endless money printing, inflating our way out of market corrections and taxpayer money bailing out reckless, over-leveraged Too-Big-to-Fail banks. It's money outside the control of banks and government. The idea that those same TBtF banks could turn around and make a cryptocurrency they can control/inflate again and everyone will suddenly go 'Oh ok fine, we'll use that one' is sort of absurd. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 19:00:42


Ah, a capitalist. 
Fees are in BtC, not dollars. If market price goes from $400 to $4,000, a $0.10 transaction is now $1.00. Multiply that out a few bubbles: Bitcoin becomes a decentralized, borderless, unstoppable wealth transfer system for ~1-2 million early adopters and people with mountains of money who can buy in. I.e we've radically empowered tech nerds and the 1%, and shut out 99% of the world.

With all due respect this is crazy talk. You're suggesting a hard fork for a problem that doesn't currently exist. 
In the event of your hypothetical Mad Max style dust storm, the miners will include or ignore transactions - as in the stress test, higher fee transactions will go through fine. At worst, we could look into filtering solutions for nodes, but a hard fork crippling free transactions and assuming we'll never figure out microtransactions is nuts.

Banks can't adopt Bitcoin because they're fused at the hip with government/fiat. If/when Bitcoin has a large enough market cap that millions of dollars are being flung around the world outside of capital controls and taxation they're going to perk right up. 
The reaction to that will vary by country. Some may embrace it, finally happy to be untethered from Too-Big-To-Fail monoliths that keep breaking the economy and needing bailouts, and some will freak right the hell out and try to clamp down and control or ban it. Some might walk a middle road and tax the on/off ramps into fiat. 
Countries with crappy currencies that get bossed around by the petrodollar will have a lot more to gain from adopting Bitcoin than countries with strong local currencies.

This is some very clever marketing/annoying semantics on the part of the TinyBlock™ people. No Bitcoin owner will view things this way.
If I buy $500 worth of Bitcoin off Coinbase and have been buying stuff with it, there's a hard fork raising the cap to 8MB, I don't suddenly have an altcoin.

I'm not sure why you think that example doesn't apply. Bitcoin runs on the Internet, and is stored on hard drives. Bitcoin will be increasingly adopted, Moore's Law will outpace the growth rate of humans, and more and more transactions will go on the blockchain. 
I agree with you - if Bitcoin isn't scaling fast enough for coffee to go on the blockchain, then it won't, and other services will fill the gap. I'm just pointing out that in 20 years, 200x (1500 tps) growth rate is completely doable.  (If we don't intentionally hobble Bitcoin by leaving the block size capped.)

You're confusing software/server centralization with development centralization. The Bitcoin network can't pay developers to work on it.
Satoshi's original code had a 32MB limit. He envisioned GB blocks as internet speeds/hardware increased. I'd rather see the block size raised, gradually or otherwise, than have this whole thing collapse/logjam due to politics over this minor anti-spam rule.

Original quote is [here]( Emphasis mine. 
"It would be nice to keep the blk*.dat files small as long as we can.
**The eventual solution will be to not care how big it gets.**
But for now, while it's still small, it's nice to keep it small so new users can get going faster.  When I eventually implement client-only mode, that won't matter much anymore.
There's more work to do on transaction fees.  In the event of a flood, you would still be able to jump the queue and get your transactions into the next block by paying a 0.01 transaction fee.  
However, I haven't had time yet to add that option to the UI.
Scale or not, the test network will react in the same ways, but with much less wasted bandwidth and annoyance."

The only difference is - with Bitcoin you have a choice. You can use those services if it's important to you, or not. Currently I can't go to my credit card and say 'I'd like opt out of your fraud protection in exchange for a lower interest rate.'  (Or if we want to trace it further back, paying 1-2% less per purchase.)

You make it sound a foregone conclusion. The banks are also sitting on a lion's share of the world's wealth, which they'll use to push their agenda  (read: try to save themselves), particularly on people who aren't tech savvy enough to parse the differences between cryptocurrencies. 
It should be interesting. Would a few trillion in marketing dollars have pushed a Zune above iPods? Keeping in mind the narrative will be  "Patriots use Zune because they love freedom, iPods are for drug dealers, terrorists and pedophiles. Get yourself a Zune, pleb."

There's basically no chance of this. Limited supply - 21 million coins, period is one of Bitcoin's core value propositions. Changing this would permanently tank the price to pennies a coin. Miners aren't that reckless. 
We don't have to design for miner profitability. The system is self-correcting and will always be at razor-thin margin. If miners drop out because it's no longer profitable, the difficulty drops and it becomes more profitable for the remaining miners.

Miners don't need to know what the 'right fee' is, they want to be profitable, and include transactions top down, highest price first.
Wallets could benefit from knowing, and offering a user a choice of 'high/medium/low' priority fees. You could guess these numbers by looking at the previous n blocks to get an idea that would work in most (non spike) circumstances. 
For bonus points, the wallet could add 'if spike then double fee for high priority transactions'.

Buy Bitcoins on Coinbase, transfer to a wallet you control like every damned PSA on this forum suggests. Coinbase helps get more coins into more hands on a scale order of magnitudes higher than LocalBTC hand to hand transfers.

Bitcoin derivatives are not a good thing, people should be extremely wary.
There is no 'almost' owning Bitcoins, you either have the private keys (you own Bitcoins) or you do not (you own IOUs). 'Paper Bitcoins', ETFs, or coins left on an exchange aren't yours. Most exchanges won't even regularly post proof of reserves to show they're not running a fractional reserve. If anything happens, the parent company goes bankrupt, is hacked, exit scams, a rogue developer moves the coins and flees to the Caribbean, the business follows the wrong fork, your local government outlaws crypto etc, you may be left with nothing in your retirement account.
'But I'll just sue them in that case!' Right, see also: MtGOX, four years later and zip, nothing. At best, customers will get pennies on the dollar after the lawyers take their share. I also see a lot of 'this is fine, we want things to be easier so Average Joe can buy in!' I think that's setting ourselves up for a large market crash in the future when invariable some ETF has lax security and the coins are stolen and dumped back on the market.
TLDR: Don't buy IOUs or ETFs. Buy actual coins and move them to a wallet you control.

Half the posts on this subreddit are variations on ‘What’s going on with the price!?’ or ‘’Where is the price going next!?’ 
It’s pretty straightforward, here’s some light reading on the [Wyckoff trading method]( The TLDR is: large players slowly establish a position without substantially moving the market, then wait for a sentiment shift or bad news to switch to shorting and dump, often while colluding with other big players to clear out [stop-loss orders]( on exchanges, then buy in lower and repeat with a larger position. I’m sure you’ve already noticed the social media fudsters come out of the woodwork at each drop to further drum up panic. 
It’s harder, but also possible to do the reverse as a cascading [short squeeze]( and clear out all the ‘Bitcoin is doomed, it’s going to zero!’ shorters on the way back up. 
The solution is to stop being an emotional investor and ignore the FUD, drama and resist panic selling. Bear markets are fantastic buying opportunities, if you have the guts to go against the prevailing sentiment, both by buying when everyone is convinced the project is doomed, *and* by selling small amounts when everyone is convinced we’re going to $200,000.
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:56:34


Strictly speaking, nothing is ever ‘backed by’ anything, it’s a phrase used to give the impression something *should* hold its value. Unfortunately nothing has [intrinsic value](
Is you want to switch to ‘what gives Bitcoin value?’ then it’s the same as anything: supply and demand in the market. ‘Why the demand then?’ Some people collect bitcoins to protect themselves from inflation due to government policies of rampant money printing, some want the freedom to move money anywhere, instantly for pennies without needing ‘approval’ from authorities, or to avoid taxation and tariffs, and many collect bitcoins because they’ve rapidly increased in value over the past nine years.

No, it [really can't]( Somewhere around the [200%-250%]( debt-to-GDP ratio things go all Zimbabwe/Venezuela/Weimar Republic. If you're lucky, maybe you can pull a Japan and lose [twenty years of productivity]( in a deflationary cycle. 
Money printing (quantitative easing, competitive devaluation, currency wars) [increases wealth disparity]( because the [65% of Americans]( that live paycheck to paycheck can't purchase stocks, ~~bonds~~ commodities or hedges against inflation. 
Countries have two options: default on the debt or destroy the value of the currency. Right now, the US is hanging in there because it's destroying the value of USD slowly, hoping nobody notices, and they're able to [outsource inflation]( to other countries (somewhat) due to being a reserve currency other countries use to stabilize their crappier currency.

Shorting: 
Imagine I borrow your Playstation 4 to play some God of War when the price of a PS4 is $300, but instead of playing games, I immediately sell it on Craigslist for $300. A week later, Sony drops the price to $250. I then buy you a new PS4 for $250, replacing the one I owed you, and pocket $50.
That's shorting in a nutshell. You borrow a stock, commodity or asset, sell it, and agree to give it back at a later date, making money if the price goes down.
Short squeeze:
That ‘buy a PS4 back’ on an open market causes the price to rise, which can trigger other investors to have to buy as well, which can cascade, rapidly driving the price up.

It doesn’t matter if a company swears up and down on their mother’s grave that something is ‘physically backed’ you have to trust them. Bitcoin was *specifically designed* to remove the need to trust third parties. 
Large pools of coins are targets. There is no 'almost' owning Bitcoins, you either have the private keys (you own Bitcoins) or you do not (you own IOUs). 'Paper Bitcoins', ETFs, or coins left on an exchange aren't yours. Most exchanges won't even regularly post proof of reserves to show they're not running a fractional reserve. If *anything* happens: the parent company goes bankrupt, is hacked, exit scams, a rogue developer moves the coins and flees to the Caribbean, the business follows the wrong fork, your local government outlaws crypto etc, you may be left with nothing on the exchange, or with an ETF, in your retirement account.
'But insurance!’ Or ‘I'll just sue them in that case!'

I think that's setting ourselves up for a large market crash in the future when invariably some ETF has lax security and the coins are stolen and dumped back on the market.

Fixed supply currencies were used for thousands of years. The fall of the Roman Empire is pretty closely correlated to the [debasement]( of their currency - over time the coins were minted with less and less gold and silver. It's ironic that the main argument against crypto is that it 'isn't backed by anything', that's *exactly* what fiat currency is. First rule in politics, accuse your opponent of doing what you're trying to hide.
Today, the [powers that be]( wrestled the ability to print money away from the populace methodically over the past hundred years by manipulating the gold and silver markets with [derivatives]( then by gold confiscation/[outlawing]( and finally by the 'invention' of fiat currencies (currency not backed by gold or silver). The ridiculous, $90 billion a month [quantitative easing]( madness didn't start until recently though, under the auspices of the 2007 financial crisis, and populace just hasn't woken up to the scam en masse yet. There's also a *lot* of 'trust us, everything is fine' Keynesian nonsense injected into the system via the media, and a carefully cultivated social stigma against sound money, both precious metals and crypto. 
The playbook is always the same, wait for a severe crisis then pass 'regulation' that carefully strips away power in a manner too complicated to parse. They've overplayed their hand this last round though, even Average Joe is now starting to realize something is very wrong. It doesn't take a lot of deep thought to realize your parents could buy a house, two cars, support a wife and two kids and retire early in the 1950's off one median-income salary.

Bitcoin has very specific rules, one of which is the longest *valid* chain, or 51% wins. The assumption is people won't vote to wreck their investment. 
I used to think the hashrate was enough to protect it from manipulation, and it is, at the transaction level. Lately I've been wondering if Bitcoin may be vulnerable to social engineering. 
Bitcoin *must* tackle challenges of all type head-on while we're growing, including the non-mathmatical, messy, human variety. If this system has flaws, including swaying users into manipulating the system via appeals to emotion or whatever, we might as well test that now in the early stages before countries/banks/half the world are using it.

If the price drops to $350, I buy one and give that new one to him and I've effectively made $50.

Good grief, tough crowd. Well, it's not 'all my money' it's $804. 
I'll admit 1 in 2 is optimistic - but the lottery? Your odds are 1 in 176,000,000 that Bitcoin will exist, and be above $402 in five years? Why are dozens of businesses investing hundreds of millions into it?

The title pre-supposes that Bitcoin needs to submit to legal scrutiny. It won't, it can't. There's no owner, it's distributed, decentralized, global - which country's laws do you even want to try to be compliant with?
Everyone is still thinking in the old paradigm. The genie is already out of the bottle, and it's a freight train, [$120 billion]( market cap, almost [10,000]( nodes worldwide, [22 million of users]( hundreds of developer submits per version, the lightning network growing at a clip...

I think you need to read a little about money, supply and demand and fiat currency. All currencies are 'nothing' in your sense of the term. Shells, beads, gold, silver, oil - they're are all placeholders for 'value' when enough people believe they are. 
If I deposit my paycheck into a bank, that's just ones and zeros in a ledger on a bank computer. When I deposit my paycheck, those ones and zeros are tweaked. 
I'd also suggest reading about quantitative easing. That's more in line with the 'psychological games' that are being played to transfer wealth from citizens to the government these days.

My personal conspiracy theory utterly missing a single shred of evidence: Some diabolical Wall St types didn't want to be left out of a potentially revolutionary new global market, and decided to hunt down a few of the early miners and pay them to slowly, inexorably crash the market by periodically dumping  thousands of coins, perfectly timed to drive the price back down on any bump up. Squeezing out every last weak hand by driving the price into the toilet... before they call up their buddies at JP Morgan and buy things up.

Excellent question. Usually yeah.

Or the absurdly wealthy 2% with millions of dollars lying around? Who own ~80% of the real estate, stock market and corporations? Or you're envisioning the Winklevii giving 1/500th of a Bitcoin and a new smartphone to everyone on the planet, rather than becoming the 2% v2.0?

$0.02, but Bitcoin is still in too few hands to be correlated to things like the stock market, recessions, depressions, currency fluctuations and the like. I also wouldn't think it's correlated to US political party affiliation either, as it's global. China, Japan and Europe all have large shares of coins.
IMHO Bitcoin's price and volatility is still mainly influenced by a few hundred whales with thousands/tens of thousands of coins. The current market really only exists to get them to sell/diversify them to a larger pool of holders and slowly decrease volatility. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:47:39


Price fluctuations take time to trickle through the economy. If we create a few trillion dollars of a currency, it will take years for that to filter through everything, but eventually that shopkeeper notices that his profit margins are getting slimmer, the wholesaler in China he's buying from is raising the price of gum again etc, and is forced to raise prices. Short-term, the differences in price could be due to currency fluctuations, supply and demand, ingredient/packaging costs, shipping costs, VAT taxes, tariffs or whatever, but long term it's generally just inflation.
A pint of chocolate milk cost $0.10 when my parents where in elementary school, $0.50 when I was and $1.49 now. Inflation allows the government to syphon off wealth from people without it really being noticed. Or put another way, anyone that worked hard but stored their wealth in US dollars, they have the same number of dollars, but those dollars lost about 80% of their purchasing power. 
'Unit of account' is simply saying 'for comparison, let's treat this thing thing as the baseline, and measure fluctuations of something else against it'. As a thought experiment, you could consider Bitcoin the unit of account, and view dollars, euro or gold as the thing that's changing in relation to it. This leads to thoughts like 'maybe Bitcoin isn't becoming more valuable, it's just the rest of the world overprinting' which are a little weird because it's  hard to separate from 'countries are overprinting, so people are buying Bitcoins to hedge against that, driving the price up'. See also: [currency wars]( a.k.a. 'competitive devaluation' because that sounds a hell of a lot better than 'race to the bottom'. :)

Just to clarify, governments can't tax Bitcoin. At best, they could tax the transition into and out of fiat currencies. If that tax becomes something significant, like 10% or more, people will simply:
 - Spend them on stuff they need anyway 
 - Use bitcoin to buy particularly liquid/tradable things like gift cards, gold, commodities 
 - Sell them on foreign exchanges where they aren't taxed and wire the funds home
 - Use LocalBitcoin to transfer directly into cash

Apologies, here's a repost from six months ago for the newbies:
Seriously guys, avoid day-trading. There's a reason HODL is a meme here. You can agonize over if Ethereum is syphoning off market share, the DAO will impact prices, exchanges going offline, governments outlawing it, pending scaling upgrades, private blockchains, hacks, thefts, political forking and venture capital all you want, it's all just noise. The concept is solid, proven, but adoption takes time.
The way you make money is to wait for the next spike, i.e. years. We've had four major 10x (or higher) bubbles and crashes. I stressed and theorized like crazy watching things crash from $214 down to $88. I had friends call me up yelling/crying because they lost thousands of dollars, panicked and sold, and friends who thought they were geniuses making an extra $400 timing a dip... and it was an utter waste of time and effort. The two friends that don't handle stress well sold around $100 after chewing me out on the phone, and then watched in horror as Bitcoin went from $90 to $1150.
The friends that did a little research, bought what they could and just went on with their life, not checking the chart every day, assuming I'd let them know if something interesting happened made a lot of money. (Ok, to be fair here, one got Gox'd.)
Bitcoin is still in relatively few hands. These whales wait for anything resembling bad news and cause 20% crashes to buy in lower. Ignore it. Get off r/bitcoin and go play video games and drink and try new restaurants and stuff. The next spike is coming.
Carry on. :)

You're completely missing the point of this post. Governments would *love* to have everyone in their country consider their particular currency to be 'the unit of account', meaning (in the US at least) everyone just prices everything in dollars, they have a good idea of what a dollar is worth, and call it a day, and generally people do.
But holy crap is it more complicated than that. As you start to learn about economics you realize that *everything* exists in a free market, including US dollars, which fluctuate against [every other world currency]( commodity, bond, security, precious metal etc. A market where people are buying and selling things for other things, arbitraging little differences to make money, and converting into and out of currencies only if it makes them money, or is more convenient to do so. 
Currencies are stable until they're not. When a government screws up, say in [Venezuela]( via corruption and/or overprinting, the currency hyperinflates, rapidly approaching worthless. You then have people paying for groceries with wheelbarrows full of bills. 
Like your post, people assume the US dollar is a universal unit of account because it's generally stable, but even that ignores a ton of crap going on behind the scenes - China/the EU working find a replacement for the petrodollar or the FED printing $90 billion a month for five years of [quantitative easing]( Governments will generally print money if they think they can get away with it, but eventually get carried away and destroy its value. [The average fiat currency lasts 27 years]( 
TLDR: Just because this post is succinct doesn't mean it's not correct or insightful.

The price drops. At some point people start going "Oh wow, $100 coins, I'll get a few and make a quick buck" and the price flatlines again... then the weak hands that got out months ago go "Oh crap, this might be a bottom, I should get in again" and people pile in again... the long-term iron-willpower hodlers ignore all this like Zen masters.

@_date: 2015-05-20 19:36:20
This is a pattern over months, not a single trade, and it involves significant amounts of capital to pull off:
 - Select a shallow, volatile stock, slowly acquire a significant amount on small dips.
 - Wait for drops and sell, especially on bad news, forcing the stock lower to shake out emotional investors (which further drops the price). Short the asset, so you profit on the drop.
 - Repeat much as possible, magnifying the drops, shorting, forcing the stock lower and lower, forcing out more and more people who can't stomach the losses and cash out. Meanwhile wait for some event/news that would increase the price.
 - On the news release, sell your shorts and buy back a ton of the stock, sending it rocketing back up, cash out slowly at the top to preserve as much momentum as possible. 
 - After the new high stabilizes, repeat the process on the way back down. This is basically it - you make money off emotional people that buy high, panic and sell low.

Eh, I can see both sides here. Googling 'should I use stop loss orders?' has compelling arguments for both.
You can show a stock plummeting 30% and rebounding, then going on over the next year to double again, 'costing' the investor thousands in missed opportunity. Or you can show a stock plummeting 30% and then steadily dropping over the next year to pennies a share, 'saving' the investor 70% of his principal.

Jobs, investing, tax evasion, investing, startups, freelancing, saving, theft, get-rich-quick schemes etc. People and businesses as a whole are obsessed with accumulating money, it quite natural to assume people are trying to find ways of taking yours. 
So it's just plain easier for someone to dismiss Bitcoin as a ponzi scheme or scam designed to fleece people of their hard-earned cash than stop and consider 'cash as I know it may slowly switch over to this new format' which has never happened in their lifetime.

Sure, but they don't realize they're just laying the infrastructure for us. They'll hire a bunch of crypto guys, build out all the tools, back end and hooks into the existing financial system and set themselves up with a nice walled garden where they're still able to collect fees as middlemen. Then in a few years they'll realize China has their own blockchain/coin where they maintain control, and so does the UK, EU, Russian and every other country, each with its own incompatible system bogged down by oversight, taxes, fees, commissions, KYC, blacklists, rules and regulations. 
And a few years after that, some bright soul will go 'Damn, it's such a mess converting from one coin to another and complying with ever-increasing regulation. All we did was make yet another digital FOREX market, if only there was one global blockchain, not controlled by anyone we could pin all of these country-specific blockchains to...' 
And meanwhile in the background, the fiat leak continues as more and more people squirrel a little bit of money outside the existing precarious system, and Bitcoin's price and market cap continue to inch upwards.

Agree. 
 - I've watched perfectly reasonable, informative posts go from +10 to -5 in the span of a few minutes 
 - The same leading questions being asked by one-month old accounts: When Bitcoin forks, can I spend on both chains? If four miners own 70% of the hashrate, how can Bitcoin be decentralized? Oh noes I 'forgot' a fee, is my money lost!? Can the Chinese firewall break Bitcoin? What happens when quantum computers break SHA-256? What happens when Bitcoin is full and everyone switches to Ethereum and the price skyrockets and because I got in early I get rich and buy an island in the Caribbean? 
 - Repeated character assassination attempts
 - Refusal to agree on approaches, nitpicking proposals without suggesting solutions, timelines are always too fast or slow, inability to even agree on terms like 'spam' 'full' 'centralized' and the like. If someone suggests the devs are steering the ship, sidetrack the conversation by saying nodes or miners should be...
 - Sockpuppets talking to themselves using the same word choice, grammar, tone, punctuation, ignoring people who answer their questions and instead steering the conversation towards specific talking points
 - Generalized FUD: Mike Hearn quit! He's helping the banks build a totally sweet walled-garden Bitcoin killer! Blockstream bought up  the blockchain so they can make bank with the Lightning Network! SegWit is too complicated and probably buggy and I hate it! China just banned Bitcoin again! If we don't immediately fork to ~~32MB~~ ~~16MB~~ ~~8MB~~ ~~4MB~~ 2MB then everything will come crashing down and everyone will move to (altcoin I bought a crapton of last week)!

Ok, this really isn't that big a mistake to make here. Most people on the planet have spent their entire life equating 'digital' with 'able to effortlessly copied'. We've spent the last twenty years sending documents all over the place knowing that copy and paste left the original somewhere. Computers crash so you make backups everywhere, you put email, photos and videos on the cloud, you send contacts around - copies everywhere. The music industry is in toilet because people are just copying and pasting the work of artists all over the damn place. 
People are going to assume 'digital currency' can be copied. Or possibly that 'mining' is process of duplicating it. Or that 'the Bitcoin software' can crash and vaporize your money. Decentralization is a rough concept too - ie that 'the Bitcoin company' can't just print more money if they want. It's a lot to learn! Help them!

This forum man, I feel like I'm taking [crazy pills]( The vast majority of people know we need more bandwidth, and extremely talented minds are busy working on it. SegWit is an increase to 1.7x increase as wallets adopt it. There are also talks of a hard fork to 2MB in 2017 once that's rolled out. And in the meantime, we get to gather actual data about what happens when blocks fill up and see how a fee market would work. 
If you think Bitcoin is *OMG doomed* there's nothing anyone on Reddit can do to help you. The developers are not coming on here and tallying up Redditor's opinions to see what they should be working on. Sell your Bitcoins and dump it into Apple stock. Your mental health will improve. 
On a scale of 'how much does this affect the world' repeating one-line complaints on Reddit is about a 1.2 out of 10.

I respect the points and arguments laid out here, but I have to disagree. From what we've seen in two years, the altcoin market is shrinking - they end up being premined scams, attempts to re-centralize control for companies, or just plain fail to reach a scale where they're secured by enough hashing power. 
Bitcoin is several orders of magnitude larger, more valuable and more publicized. Could an altcoin dethrone it? Possibly, but I doubt by just copying Bitcoin and changing a variable - that's already been tried hundreds of times.

This is borderline FUD. China is 1.3 billion people - it's no surprise that they could control the majority of hashing power. The solution to this, if you care, is to spin up some farms in other countries, i.e. 'compete'. 
Second, these are pool - if they do something shady, the individual miners point their hashing power to another pool, which has happened in the past when one pool gets too large.

Not progress, supply and demand. Switch out a bus for Disney World - you're managing an amusement park. For the first few years people come in, ride the roller coasters, eat cotton candy and everything is awesome, then it slowly gets more and more popular.
At some point, you can't keep letting people in. If you just let everyone in they end up waiting three hours for a single ride and they're pissed off, leave crappy Yelp reviews and tell their friends not to go. There are plans to expand the park and add a couple rides, but it will take a year or two to build them. In the meantime, what do you do?
You increase the entrance fee. Maybe it's cheaper on weekdays, or in the winter, or you have coupons or whatever, but just having a dynamic entrance fee based on demand solves this problem. If you raise it too little, people scalp your tickets. Raise it too much, you lose money and have a half-empty park. At some point the market tells you an ideal price point between making everyone happy with short lines, and making everyone happy that it's cheap to get in. 
Yes, this prices out poor people. People saying 'we can't price people out!' is the same as saying 'everyone should be able to get in to Disney World for free!'

We've never had a country that's tried a fixed/deflationary currency, it's always been too tempting for those in charge to print more money. The US was chugging along fine on the gold/silver standard until it *cough* needed more money to pay for the Civil War.

First off, solid post. 
Sort of a side point, I think we're already quite a ways from Satoshi's invention. I don't think Satoshi anticipated the separation of nodes and miners, or pooled mining. I think he wanted Bitcoin to be a little app you run in the background on your laptop, using 2% of CPU resources to route transactions and mine for blocks with a *very* slim chance your computer ever wins a block reward (with an eventual max of 1-2 billion computers worldwide routing/mining). 
In that form it would be the tiniest of resource drains, extremely decentralized, impossible to shut down, and trustless - everyone already has a full node and wallet ready to go. 
Then as the market price increased, there's thousands of dollars on the line every ten minutes. Someone decides to devote 100% CPU resources to up their chance of winning that lottery 50x. Everyone follows suit to not have their odds reduced. Then someone figures out how to get their GPU to search for solutions 200x faster, then the ASICs arms race, die shrinks and warehouses of ASICs built wherever electricity is cheapest. 
Greed, man. Tragedy of the Commons, race to the bottom, wealth disparity, whatever you want to call it. It's the history of companies, markets, governments... most of what humanity does. It makes me want to not leave the house.

Not really - they could shut down the on-ramps from fiat. Close Coinbase, seize the coins there, and outlaw fiat transactions to offshore exchanges like Circle, Bitstamp, BTC-E etc. Then we're back to LocalBitcoin deals in alleys like drug dealers. 
There's a few possibilities why this hasn't happened yet - maybe they like crypto, and approve of FinTech innovation, or will allow it as a potential hedge against too-big-to-fail banks. Maybe they see it as a potential threat (per the RAND analysis), but think it's too small a market cap ($6 billion) to bother with at the moment, or it's too difficult for average Joe to ever really get on board.
Maybe they're engaged in brinkmanship with other countries. If one country outlaws it, other countries could suddenly have a massive head start, should cryptocurrencies take off. 
But don't think they can't outlaw it and/or monitor transactions, which would massively slow adoption. The average user isn't going to risk incarceration, encrypt his home computer, install TOR etc, and Wikileaks has already shown the degree to which governments can monitor Internet traffic.

There isn't a market. This is *the* critical distinction. The DTCC will claim a BankCoin is worth $x million because 'they say so' and use this private blockchain as a digital clearinghouse, updating legacy technology. Settlement will take hours instead of days. 
There's no supply cap. We plebeians don't get to buy BankCoins. Banks will either be sold or given them by a trusted third party. Disputes, rollbacks etc will be handled by a trusted third party, and so on. It preserves the existing power structure (the banks are obviously not going to create or use something that disintermediates them.) 
It's the same thing people have been saying in this forum for a year. This is a walled garden - a closed, monitored, company-wide intranet, not an open, free to innovate, nobody owns it, everyone can make a website, Internet. It's an interesting test of the technology, but in this form at least, it's as much of a threat to Bitcoin as a bike messenger is to FedEx.

I wouldn't even want to know how much power the NASDAQ uses each day for trillions of stock transactions. 
Or, how much resources are used mining gold out of the ground, refining it and shipping it around the world when transactions are needed?

Solid post. For me personally? Because the tech is revolutionary. We've never had a digital bearer asset before. It's wealth you alone control that can't be seized, monitored, taxed or inflated away. 
Take the closest analogy, gold. $10 million in gold weighs 500lbs and requires a secure building, vault, cameras and ideally a few armed guards. Transporting it requires an armored truck, plane, armed escort, insurance forms, approval (taxes paid) from two governments and another building, vault etc at the destination. 
$10 million in Bitcoin can be disguised as a grocery list. It can be transported anywhere with Internet access in ten minutes for a nickel with zero chance some bank/government/middleman can take a 'small fee' to make sure you're 'compliant with local rules and regulations'. If that doesn't get you thinking I don't know what will.

This argument doesn't pan out longer term. Cryptocurrencies are trustless/uncensorable at the cost of efficiency (massive redundancy).
If Bitcoin's network is maxing out at ~1-2 million users, how many altcoins would you like to make to support the six billion people on the planet? You're envisioning how many tens of thousands of altcoins/blockchains with miners gobbling up the world's power?

"That error is the assumption that long-term value is what makes a currency good. The truth is it’s almost the opposite."
This is so wrong it makes my teeth hurt. That chart is showing how since 1974, the government has "only" taken 2-6% of your savings every year. So eventually, Uncle Sam [takes all your money]( 
The working class has been conditioned to 2-4% inflation for so long (multiple generations now) that they just accept this skimming as a law of physics. *Of course* you can't save cash - it will drop 50% in purchasing power in 20 years. You need to put that cash in the stock market, or a retirement fund, or buy a house if you want to break even. (Please ignore those stock market crashes every eight years, and that housing crash, those are uh... market anomalies.)
The idea that *everyday people* would benefit from a currency going up in value rather than governments or bankers "managing" those rates for the 98% is now seen as impossible, absurd. A ponzi scheme. 
Bitcoin is a way of moving wealth out of this system. As it turns out, people are actually pretty damned psyched to watch their currency go up in value every year, for seven years (yes, with one year as the exception). The bankers are going apoplectic over not being able to stifle adoption. If associating Bitcoin with drugs, terrorism and child pornography, exchange collapses, declaring it dead dozens of times, dragging the developers through the mud and blocksize debates didn't kill it, now they're trying out 'it's so popular it's completely full, i.e. broken'. So start selling - it's all over because it's in such high demand it's breaking! (Let's ignore that someone buying $50k on Coinbase and selling a year later doesn't actually touch the blockchain.)
Of course there's going to be spikes and crashes. You can't go from a currency being worth $0 to $50,000 without high volatility. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:10:11


Hmm, so a fee of $0.006. Let's do the math. 
At the [going rate]( of 200 satoshis per byte, and an average transaction size of [250 bytes]( or $0.61 per transaction, at current demand, you would need Bitcoin's price to crash to $12.05 to get down to that fee.
Assuming my math checks out.
EDIT: For the people downvoting, yes this is sarcasm. If you want lower fees we can do a few things:
 - Lower the price, since fees are in satoshis/byte
 - Lower demand, i.e. kick out users
 - Increase the block size (BU, a.k.a. 'just kick the whole problem over to nodes to deal with')
 - Increase the block size and set stage for a secondary layer (SegWit)

I mean this as respectfully as possible: it's just not that simple. We fork to 2MB, and in a year we're back against that cap again. If we do the same solution and fork to 4MB, we push out nodes on the majority of home broadband connections. 
Even at 2MB blocks you're looking at 300-400+ Gb a month in bandwidth with the default number of peers. In the US, broadband soft cap is 250Gb for most providers. 
I suppose the counterargument here is 'then home nodes will go away and that's fine, move them to larger businesses.'

Banks are businesses - they pass that cost on to customers to remain profitable. I'm old enough to remember when you'd get [3-5% on CDs]( now it's more like [0.3%](
[70%+ of a country's economy]( is consumer spending, which is [declining]( In the past, central banks could ward off recession by lowering interest rates to encourage people to spend and borrow, but they're now at a wall. Stock are already [more overbought than at any point in history]( and *way* overdue for a correction.
NIRP, in my opinion, is a psychotic overreaction. Many aspects of our financial system make zero sense at negative interest rates, and everyday people will just pull their money out into cash, which is 0%. They're setting their own populace up for a bank run.

The free market will determine Bitcoin's price, and the transaction fee, as it should. It would be too much of a mess to have any person or persons in charge of that. 
But we can certainly optimize the software. We're at $0.06 with ~a million users. SegWit will roll out soon, and once implemented across various wallets and exchanges we'll see a 50%+ reduction in fees, and possibly another 50% reduction if developers/miners/nodes decide a hard fork to 2MB is safe in a year or two.  
I can live with $0.02-0.04 for the next few years as we scale to 2-5 million users.

No. If you're concerned, wait for the fork to resolve before moving coins.
The odds of having two supported chains live for more than a day or two is basically nil due to the hashpower being divided. If a fork gets 20% of the hashing power, time between blocks goes up to an hour a block, and hundreds of days until the difficulty adjusts to compensate. Miners, not wanting to lose the block rewards that keep them in business will quickly drop that chain and move to the majority one, compounding the wait.
The idea of forking Bitcoin into Core and Classic chains is a fairly recent concept people are kicking around, and extremely unlikely. Market value will rapidly shift to the longest chain. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 22:47:41


Solid post, nice distilling of views here. I've watched this debate for a while now, it's tense.
Personal opinion, I think fees should be kept as absolutely low as possible, for as long as humanly possible to get more users flowing into the system. We should butt right up against the edge of allowing spam/weird tests/bloat/weird use cases, and *measurable, threatening, systemic risks to centralization*, and only then ease up - increasing the block size cap slowly, in lockstep with advances in average internet bandwidth. 
That probably lives around ~4MB blocks, but I'm not an engineer. Treating SegWit, with an (eventual) 1.75x increase as acceptable scaling for 2016 seems too conservative to me.
Your mileage may vary.

Purchasing power. It's a shadow tax. If you raise tax rates too quickly people revolt. Instead inflation makes it so your money purchases 2-6% less each year. Average Joe with no understanding of theories of wealth is left scratching his head - "man, $100 barely buys two bags of groceries now" or "damn, I got a $5k raise this year, but it seems like I keep falling further into debt" and "my dad had no college degree and bought a house at 23 and raised two kids, why can't I or any of my friends do that anymore?"

The backlash that would ensue if an insider walked away with millions of dollars of people's retirement, (MtGOX 2.0) with no recourse, only to be sued and settled via some insurance company for pennies on the dollar five years later after the lawyers got their cut, would be a nightmare.

Not likely at all - one chain will die off *very* quickly. Even a 1-2% advantage would snowball to 99% as miners scramble to get off of the losing fork. No miner wants to be wasting thousands of dollars in electricity on coins that are rocketing towards $0.

The argument of 'people will switch to alts' doesn't quite hold up to scrutiny either.

You make it sound like a bank heist. :) 
There's no 'gaining control' of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the longest valid chain. Developers from anywhere in the world can offer up tweaks to the code base, and if enough nodes/miners adopt it, it's integrated. Extensive changes require hard or soft forks, but again, if a majority wants it, it's in. This process is by design. 
It turns out math doesn't care about politics, hurt feelings, government borders, censorship, exchanges being hacked, market prices, developers rage quitting, regulatory oversight, or whatever.

Well... sort of. It complicates things that you need Bitcoin to buy Ether. In that sense all the altcoins are like kids that need to go to dad for their allowance first. Andreas said it better - each success or failure affects the value and public perception of cryptocurrency as a whole. 
I personally don't see a future where an altcoin replaces Bitcoin as the main store of value. The *process* of Bitcoin failing and an alt taking over would cause a majority of people, myself included, to pull out their investment, most likely for good.

People who want Bitcoin to succeed agree, but this is an attack vector. What's to stop the people that *don't* want Bitcoin to succeed from spinning up thousands of Classic nodes to vote for raising the 21 million coin limit just to freak everyone out (and maybe short the market to make money on the way down)?

I was honestly trying to get away from the current block size debate. 
Suppose someone came up with some awesome new type of encryption to replace SHA-256, and the compression was better, it computed 10x faster or whatever, and everyone wanted to switch, but Core 'this isn't safe for x/y/z reasons' with opponents saying 'those aren't valid reasons because of a/b/c counterpoints.'
Then another pseudo-political shitstorm ensued, and everyone took sides and entrenched, name calling, sky is falling, etc. 
How would Core, the proponents, and the technically not-quite saavy users resolve it?

I'd like to add - this article only works because you're rewinding the stock market back into the 70's for investing. For younger folks, like myself (graduated in 2000) the 2007 crash wiped out all gains - basically 0% interest when it (statistically) is supposed to double your money every seven years. 
We're poised to do that again this year. The Millennials are *screwed* - they're missing out on *two* doublings of their savings, assuming they had the ability to save to begin with, [half are living with their parents]( That's the difference between retiring with a million bucks and $250k (again, assuming the stock market rebounds back to what it used to do.)

It's just basic professionalism. Be constructive, what's the point of trying to demoralize everyone?

Ok, that's a valid counterargument actually. Here's a few more stats: 
[Five million users]( The most conservative estimates put adoption at about a million people worldwide. 
[811 million GHashes/s]( up from 295 a year ago. You're suggesting miners are interested in investing hundreds of thousands in mining hardware in a dying system.
[Price is up to $376]( it was $200 a year ago. In fact, it's been up every year, sometimes 10x a year, every year since inception, with the exception of 2014. 
Venture capital almost topped $1 billion in 2015, up from [$410 million in 2014](
[Segregated Witness]( is rolling out. It includes a 1.75 increase in effective throughput, a permanent fix for transaction malleability, a fix for OpSig bugs that could cause 10+ minute verification times and modifications that will allow all sorts of tweaks to the script system, which open a path for sidechains, confidential transactions and more]. 
So... I'm seeing 2x growth nearly across the board. Shouldn't a dying system be headed in the other direction?

It's obvious to us on the subReddit, but probably not so obvious to others - Bitcoin isn't a company. It doesn't have a marketing team with millions of dollars to promote a positive brand image and raise public awareness. It's up to us to put some work into educating people and dispelling myths/fighting trolls.

This is getting repeated frequently, and isn't really accurate - the odds of having two supported chains live for more than a day or two is basically nil due to the hashpower being divided. If a fork gets 20% of the hashing power, time between blocks goes up to an hour a block, and hundreds of days until the difficulty adjusts to compensate. Miners, not wanting to lose the block rewards that keep them in business will quickly drop that chain and move to the majority one, compounding the wait.

At this point in the debt cycle separation of money and state seems inevitable over the next few decades.

However, don't expect the powers that be to go quietly. Nearly *all* governmental powers, including the ultimate one, violence a.k.a. the ability to wage war, are derived from the ability to print money at whim, devalue all existing holders of their fiat, and kick the can down the road as an ever escalating [balance sheet]( future generations are supposed to somehow pay off.

For all the skeptics, I’ve been in this space since 2013, I heard all the same arguments and wailing and wringing of hands after the drop from $280 to $90, the drop from $1250 to $300, and now from $19,500 to $3500. Just be patient, bull runs are born from bear markets. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:38:10


He's close, but more accurately, it's a drag on *using* the currency. If someone bought 10 coins in 2011 as an investment and hasn't touched them, they're not using up block space. You could argue that they'll have to transfer them to an exchange to sell, and what if blocks are full because of a price run up, but well, pay a higher fee. 
Nearly everything I see on this block size debate keeps pointing this way. Is Bitcoin supposed to have ~5 million people owning coins, and competition to be one of those 1% drives up the price (digital gold)? Or is Bitcoin supposed to be in the hands of billions of people using it for everyday purposes (VISA 2.0)? And if it's B, is that even technically possible?

After state-mandated chipping, they'll add more and more draconian laws until it's impossible to not routinely break laws just existing, and 100% of the populace is in prison. However, you'll be allowed to have a job while in prison earning the government-approved minimum wage to pay rent on your cell, meals and government-approved entertainment, minus appropriate taxes, surcharges and fees.

**Bitcoin 101:**
Buy *small* amounts off an exchange and move them to a hardware wallet you (and you alone) control. Make sure each amount is secured before buying another. 
Wait a few years. Ignore the drama, negative media press and armchair economists telling you inflation is like, totally awesome because it 'keeps money moving' or some other Keynesian nonsense. Resist the temptation to tell all your friends, family and coworkers how much money you're making, or they'll come to your house, duct tape you to your office chair and take your coins. Also resist the temptation to make a quick buck trading some shitcoin that's promising the moon but will vaporize after the developers dump their premined share and move to the Caribbean. 
To sell, send *small* amounts from your hardware wallet to the exchange, making sure it clears to your bank account before sending another small amount. Or you know, just buy things with Bitcoin directly. 
Retire in comfort.

If 'vanish' means 'the keys are lost' then suddenly everyone else holding Bitcoin just got richer, as the total supply dropped. If vanish means a hacker steals them and drops them on the market for fiat a'la MtGox, that's already happened a few times, and the price has always slowly recovered. Honestly I think most thieves would be inclined to hold and trickle them into the market slowly to maximize their value. 
Bitcoin is slowly being distributed into more and more hands every day, meaning over time volatility will decrease (and it is).

I agree with both sides of that, but you're opening a can of worms here that rapidly veers off into an almost philosophical [Austrian vs. Keynesian]( economic debate. 
I tend towards the Austrian side, I'd guess most Bitcoin/gold fans do as well. Savings are a good thing, saved money is eventually spent, and the general populace has been brute-force conditioned over decades to just accept a 2-4% 'inflation tax' per year because 'it's good for the economy, it uh... keeps money moving.'

Ok, mildly longer post for the newbies.
Seriously guys, avoid day-trading. There's a reason HODL is a meme here. You can agonize over if Ethereum is syphoning off market share, the DAO will impact prices, exchanges going offline, governments outlawing it, pending scaling upgrades, private blockchains, hacks, thefts, political forking and venture capital all you want, it's all just noise. The concept is solid, proven, but adoption takes time. 
The way you make money is to wait for the next spike, i.e. years. We've had four major 10x (or higher) bubbles and crashes. I stressed and theorized like crazy watching things crash from $214 down to $88. I had friends call me up yelling/crying because they lost thousands of dollars, panicked and sold, and friends who thought they were geniuses making an extra $400 timing a dip... and it was *an utter waste of time and effort*. The two friends that don't handle stress well sold around $100 after chewing me out on the phone, and then watched in horror as Bitcoin went from $90 to $1150. 
The friends that did a little research, bought what they could and just went on with their life, not checking the chart every day, assuming I'd let them know if something interesting happened made a lot of money. (Ok, to be fair here, one got Gox'd.) 
Bitcoin is still in relatively few hands. These whales wait for anything resembling bad news and cause 20% crashes to buy in lower. Ignore it. Get off r/bitcoin and go play video games and drink and try new restaurants and stuff. The next spike is coming. 
Carry on. :)

This is possible, and of all your worst-case scenarios, probably the most likely, if still unlikely. I think there's a balance between Bitcoin's market share/first mover advantage but slow-to-innovate ethos and altcoin's technological innovation. 
I used to worry about this and buy a few alts to 'hedge my bets' but after years of watching 100% of altcoins crash and burn, I now view altcoins as a testbed for new ideas that, if they were radically successful, could just be folded back into Bitcoin's code.

Most journalism is.. pretty bad. 'News' is more about steering the cattle and swaying public opinion than actually informing people. Years ago journalists would do weeks of research, study and interviews on a subject before writing a piece. Today they don't have a fraction of the time required, so just do a few Google searches and hope for the best. Not to mention 'big media' has advertisers to consider, plus the agenda or political affiliation of the owners of the company and so on.

Bitcoin is decentralized, global, and transactions are open to everyone. A bank is no different than a person on the blockchain. 
Political entities can and will try to control local markets, create monopolies, crack down on exchanges and monitor traffic, but it will be a waste of time, money and effort. It just increases local price and interest which, once high enough, creates arbitrage opportunities for enterprising locals.

At bare minimum, all businesses (exchanges, banks, web wallets etc) will have to run a full node to verify all their transactions. They can't afford to trust someone else to do it for them. Likewise any investor holding a large amount will as well, as the cost of dedicating a cheap laptop and some bandwidth to a node will be minor compared to their investment. 


Mining is self-regulating. As miners drop out due to it not being profitable, the difficulty readjusts every 2016 blocks, or about two weeks, which makes it more profitable for the remaining miners. This is how we can have 10,000x increases in difficulty over Bitcoin's lifetime and still find blocks every ~10 minutes.

This is why people discourage address reuse - using the same address to receive multiple payments ever so slightly increases the risk of an address being brute-forced far in the future. But if SHA-256 is ever cracked by quantum computers, we'll have other issues than Bitcoin, as communications, banking software and nuclear launch codes are based on that encryption. 
Short answer, we should switch to another encryption standard if SHA-256 was ever at risk.

Shorting: 
Imagine I borrow your Playstation 4 to play some Last Guardian when the price of a PS4 is $300, but instead of playing games, I immediately sell it on Craigslist for $300. A week later, Sony drops the price to $250. I then buy you a new PS4 for $250, replacing the one I owed you, and pocket $50.
That's shorting in a nutshell. You borrow a stock, commodity or asset, sell it, and agree to give it back at a later date, making money *if* the price goes down. In this case however - the price went way up, and the Bitcoin exchange wanted their Bitcoins back (a 'call'), forcing the guy to buy a *ton* at market rate and give them back to the exchange at a ~~giant $10 million~~ loss.

Spoken like a customer. Bitcoin transactions are final after a confirmation or two (10-20 minutes). For merchants, credit and debit card transactions can be disputed and reversed up to 90 days later, causing all sorts of issues for them and encouraging fraud.

If your currency is based on faith, you, as a government, do absolutely everything you can to condition people over decades to trust it. Most people have never thought twice about how money works.
The FED spent five years printing $90 billion a *month* while saying 'trust us, this will totally fix things!' Finally a few people here and there are starting to wake up and wonder why only the rich are getting richer. 
Zero interest rates, banning cash and so on will not save us. This tidal wave of debt will reach the shore eventually.

**Standard PSA:** get your coins off the exchanges. If you're not the *sole* owner of the private keys, you don't own bitcoins, you own IOUs for bitcoins that the company may or may not honor. Don't get GOX'd. 
Suggestion: buy *small amounts* and immediately transfer to a wallet you control. To sell, transfer *small amounts* and wait for each one to clear. If privacy is a concern, use LocalBitcoins. 
Suggestion number two: buy things directly with bitcoin.

Guys. It's done. It's over, it's a live fork. Liquidity will increase, and then you can vote with your money.
I made this handy guide. Based on your own personal research:
**Option 1:** Do you think BCash/Bitcoin Cash/BCC has the superior feature set? Or do you think the Core developers or Blockstream are playing it too safe, stifling development or not adhering closely enough to the whitepaper and ruining the project? 
Sell your Bitcoins for BCash/Bitcoin Cash/BCC.
**Option 2**: Do you think Bitcoin has the stronger feature set, or you like those developers more because they're more talented, or have better beards, or you think 8MB blocks or ASICBoost will reduce node count or are otherwise dangerous or could cause centralization? 
Sell your BCash/Bitcoin Cash/BCC for Bitcoins.
**Option 3**: You have no goddamned idea, it's all too confusing you can't read code and there's too many arguments, counter arguments, ad hominem attacks, fanboyisms, cheerleading, politics, frankenquotes, back-room deals, cat memes or you just don't have time to read and research or you don't know how to read. 
Do nothing. The market will decide anyway.

Better yet, could we Kickstart a node with a modest ASIC miner integrated? 
Most of our decentralization issues started when we separated nodes and miners, so maybe a $100-200 device that's plug and play, auto configured not to eat up all your bandwidth so you still watch Netflix, and ready to point to a pool of your choice would help smooth out the ecosystem.

Right, because it's just taken for granted US dollars should be the [unit of account]( This is part of the 'system', by design. Governments very much want their citizens to 'think' in terms of their local currency (and ideally be bad at math). 
In the US, Average Joe assumes he has a good idea of what a dollar is worth: what a gallon of milk, shirt or new car costs. Average Joe is also probably statistically bad at math, so that [2-5%]( yearly inflation isn't factored in until he's had a job for 15 years and suddenly realizes that his groceries, rent and health insurance have all doubled, but his salary did not. In fact, he probably still thinks that $50k/year is a decent salary, not realizing he'd now have to make $100k to have the same amount of [purchasing power]( 
This is [baked into the cake]( so to speak. It's a system that mysteriously always seems to rig things against Average Joe.

Exactly this. Bitcoin absolutely must be able to withstand *all* attacks, including attempts to hijack its brand, or social engineering attacks designed to get newbies to install an 'alternate' client with 'lower fees' or 'larger blocks' and no developer support. 
It's the wild west out there. Do your research:
 - Know what you're buying. 
 - Don't let the FUD rattle you into panic selling. 
 - Protect your own keys. 
 - These scams are getting more sophisticated every generation. Don't let someone convince you to trade your bitcoins for some [altcoin]( Yes, they may even call this alt 'Bitcoin' or even 'a performance upgrade'. 
Once your coins are gone, they're gone. You'll have to rebuy your rollercoaster ticket at an inflated price or go chill on the Sad Panda ride, and that ride *sucks*.

So, to recap. 
Bitcoin becomes massively popular, 100x price increase, blocks fill up, 3-4 tps limit hit, competition for space in the block drives up transaction fees. 
Rogue splinter group becomes convinced that the block size limit is arbitrary/hindering growth, if only it was removed the price would skyrocket and they could cash out. FUD campaign to gather support and cast doubt on the existing developers, and a spam campaign to max out capacity, forcing the issue. Alts rise rapidly as people 'hedge their bets'.
Bitcoin XT, Classic, Unlimited, Emergent Concensus fail to gain support, so they force a miner-supported hard fork. BCash eeks out 15% of the market price and falling.
SegWit increases capacity to 11 tps, fees fall, tech is now poised for secondary layers. 
Am I missing anything? This space moves quickly.

Which is another way of saying 'your Bitcoins will become increasingly valuable.' This starts to verge into an Austrian vs Keynesian economic debate, but I don't think this is a concern, especially if you consider free markets to be better at self-regulating than centrally controlled ones. Governments eventually all make a complete mess of fiat currencies by overprinting, and personally I think a limited-supply currency matches nicely with the finite resources of Earth, encouraging saving over spending.
People always will need to pay rent, bills, buy clothes and food, investors will profit-take, parents will pass on wealth to their children, and other fixed-supply assets like gold have yet to crash the economy. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:08:11


This is a solid use case. In my case I use it as a hedge against government monetary policy of running the money printing press at [full tilt]( causing some of the highest inflation rates I've seen in my lifetime, along with attempts to [ban cash]( [ZIRP]( [NIRP]( and 'competitive devaluation' a.k.a. [currency wars](
With government-issued currencies going down in value, stocks at [all-time high P/E ratios]( and [bonds]( near the zero-bound, fixed-supply assets like [gold]( and Bitcoin are going up. I just find it more convenient to store a hardware wallet than a safe full of gold coins. 
Bitcoin is 100% opt-in. A fully open, permissionless protocol, and people can use it for whatever use cases they want. If your *absolutely critical* use case is spending $3.46 to send $1 somewhere and then complain about high fees on Reddit, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say Bitcoin may not be for you.

You're presenting this last drop as 'Bitcoin investors are a panicky bunch and sell at the least little bit of bad news, true or not.' 
Like everything involving money, things are way more insidious than that. From what I've seen in the past three years, these cycles are regularly spaced, and carefully manufactured. Whales in the space slowly accumulate over time and wait for 'good news', in this case the release of SegWit promising to double the blocksize, to push the price to a new high, then coordinate with other whales to dump at once on 'bad news', in this case a fake ZeroHedge article about China banning Bitcoin. The splash tanks the market price. 
The idea is to shake out weak hands and strengthen your holdings buying back in at the bottom so you can repeat the process later with even greater effect. It's a pretty basic strategy called the [Wyckoff trading method]( and traders have been running this playbook since the 1930's. Read up, it's interesting stuff.

You guys are viewing this short-term, rather than strategically or longer term (and sprinkle in a little more tinfoil hattery.) Who cares about finger pointing?
My guess is this is more of a strategic move to denounce the Bitcoin blockchain as 'not scalable' and offload customers buying and selling to Coinbase, who have a more robust exchange (GDAX) and I'm guessing, are probably much more KYC compliant for the IRS.
Then in a year or so, Circle is suddenly going to announce their own, or a strategic partner's *new and improved* blockchain project, R3Coin or FedCoin or PatriotCoin™. 
They'll have already laid the groundwork to say 'well, we tried to use Bitcoin but ~~we couldn't wrestle control of it, and Uncle Sam was up our ass~~ it was unable to progress due to developer infighting, so we stepped in, improved on the technology and are now launching this new product you can now buy and trade on GDAX!

This has been going on for nine years, this is the fifth or sixth bubble depending on what percentage you consider a rise/drop. $32 - $3 was absolutely insane, $240 - $90 was a fun one, but over pretty quickly, $1200 - $250 was a long slow capitulation due to MtGox exploding, the fallout of which is still going on. Once you've gone through one bubble, hodling is much easier. 
All the information is there if you go looking, but there's so many newbies that absolutely refuse to focus on anything but the price, thinking that number is someone end-all be-all of Bitcoin's health. That's how end up with ridiculous things like the media calling Bitcoin dead [315 times and counting]( 
Yes, price is absolutely being manipulated by whales to shake people out of the market so they can buy into a larger position at the bottom. It's been going on in the stock market since the 1930's as the ['The Wyckoff Trading Method']( read up. Hell, [try it out yourself]( if you have the capital, what you'll realize eventually is all your chart reading, tea leaves and line drawing doesn't matter when the next bull market bumps the price up 15x, your most ill-timed buys are suddenly runaway winners. 
Metrics for measuring the Bitcoin network's overall health:
 - is total [node count]( going up? (decentralization) 
 - is total [hash rate]( going up? (security)
 - does the codebase have [constant commits]( from dozens of developers, or is it basically dead like some (*cough*) altcoins (innovation/improvements)
 - the rate at which new accounts are being [set up on exchanges]( (user adoption)
 - are [new]( [companies]( entering the space? (corporate adoption)

It's interesting, matching up stocks as an asset class against crypto. 
On the pro-crypto side:
 - There's limited issuance, i.e. the company can't [dilute]( existing shareholders by issuing more shares, or split the stock, or decide the company's growth has flatlined and switch to penny dividends.
 - The stock trades 24/7 instead of during business hours, preventing a privileged ['after hours']( set of traders. (Who are able to sell based on that 8pm quarterly earnings report which tanks the stock 20% in the morning.)
 - [High-frequency trading]( and more importantly, [front-running]( isn't possible (or possible on an exchange, just not on the blockchain.)
 - [Settlement/ownership]( occurs in ~10 minutes instead of 2-4 business days.
 - Trading fees are $0.50 instead of $5-$10.
 - It's just math, you don't need TDAmeritrade to 'handle things for you, for a small fee.' Nobody can freeze your account because there's no account, or social security number, or even an identity needed to move your money around, just an internet connection. A four year old, a computer AI, a dog or a refrigerator can buy and sell at will.
 - Popular (FANG) stocks trade with ridiculous, unsustainable earnings multiples. Tesla, for instance, is trading at 125x future earnings. With a market capitalization of $47 billion, Tesla is valued at about [$435,000]( for every car it delivered last year, and about $47,000 for every car it *hopes* to produce in 2020.
*'But like, stocks are stable man! Bitcoin is down like 50% since December!'*
Yep, and up over 200% year over year. I mean, 8-9% a year is fine too, we haven't had a 50% ~~haircut~~ correction in the stock market since... oh [2008]( or so.

Out of touch? The data is right there for anyone to look at. Bitcoin has appreciated [every year of it's existence]( except for one (2014). Most years 10x or more in value. Why?


Bitcoin isn't a ponzi scheme, that was debunked years ago, there's even a [TED talk]( on it. For it to be a ponzi, the original authors would get a cut of every buy. Unless you want to say 'early adopters get rich though!' which is... how all stocks work. 


Store of value, or simply 'better money'. Do I want the currency that's depreciating 2-4% a year, or the one that's going up?


Well, the genie is sort of out of the bottle here. They can't ban Bitcoin transfers any more than they can outlaw filesharing, TOR, or math. They could try to clamp down on the fiat on/off ramps, but so far governments are happy just taxing capital gains. Likewise if a country outlaws it, but others embrace it, the ones that adopt it get the benefits of this new technology while the others miss out. 
Could it theoretically go to zero? Sure, so could Apple's stock. That doesn't make Bitcoin or Apple a bad investment.

I really doubt it. I'm starting to get the impression there's this inverse relationship in cryptocurrencies between market cap and how 'baked down' the code is. The more money at stake, the more skittish people are and the less likely upgrades/tweaks/changes become. Investors don't want the coin they bought to change properties any more than they want a company's stock they bought to pivot from biotech to try and become a software company or whatever. 
I won't be surprised though if a group of developers decide to leave Bitcoin to put their expertise to work creating an altcoin. If Bitcoin doesn't want it, maybe SegWit can find a home on a new chain, with people buying in if they like it.

Yes, you're correct, Bitdigester phrased that wrong or maybe just awkwardly?
The suit (purchasing power) is the unit of account here, not the dollar. If $20 (or an oz. of gold) buys you a suit in 1913 and $1000 (or an oz. of gold) buys you a suit today, then gold *has* kept up in terms of purchasing power, while the fiat currency is worth much less. You'd need the same ounce of gold, but 50x more fiat to buy that suit 100 years later. 
What the OP is implying then is that gold and Bitcoin *retain* their purchasing power, while fiat is perpetually losing 2-3% a year.

So, Bitcoin was created as a reaction to the 2007/8 financial crisis, Satoshi left us a link to an article in the [genesis block]( itself as a reminder. 
Banks had essentially gambled with customer deposits, chiefly in the form of subprime mortgage-backed securities (CDOs), repackaged as 'safe' by (regulatory captured) ratings agencies, and were on the brink of a systemic round of bankruptcies that had already closed down Lehman Brothers and [25 other banks]( pushed Merrill Lynch, AIG, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, HBOS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Fortis, Hypo and Alliance &amp; Leicester to within a hair's width of bankruptcy, requiring [$4.6 trillion]( in taxpayer bailout money, dropped the DOW [777 points]( the largest drop in history, wiped out [5.5 million jobs]( peaking unemployment at [10.1%]( to settle at 8.1% today and of course, spiked foreclosures [88%]( kicking 860,000 people out of their homes and wiping out [$19.2 trillion]( in household wealth, with [7.5 million]( or 8.6% of all homeowners underwater on their mortgage. The people were robbed to paper over this emergency, the world still hasn't recovered, is still in a recession, and banks are just as over-leveraged now as in 2007, some more so. We fixed nothing. 
This is the [history of banking]( and the origin of every liquidity crisis, some entity going 'we'll just hold and protect your x for a small fee, and dole them out when you need them.' Then loan them out in a fractional reserve environment, and crash and burn if too many people request ownership at the same time.
Bitcoin attempts to solve this systemic threat by taking the control of wealth away from the banks, and putting it squarely back in the hands of the people. To your point, yes, we can't stop people from giving up power for convenience, but... you shouldn't. :)

Bitcoin is a completely new asset class that we're bootstrapping from $0. It's impossible to do that without these cycles of volatility. I didn't hear any merchants complaining through all of 2017 when they were gaining 10-20% a month, retroactively on all Bitcoin sales they'd *ever made*.
Wait for the market to rebound if you want, or hedge for fiat, or whatever else you'd like to do to smooth out volatility for your own business. If/when Bitcoin achieves worldwide adoption, it's going to be incredibly stable, and the same people complaining about volatility will switch to complaining about how they can't make money off it anymore.

If you mean 'one entity that settles to Bitcoin for the benefit of us plebeians' then I disagree. There's no reason to accept that degree of centralization. The hundreds of thousands of people who already hold coins aren't going to give them back to exchanges for safekeeping. 
If you mean 'thousands of companies like Coinbase, Circle, ChangeTip etc, with more slowly being added over time as bandwidth increases' that all settle to the Blockchain periodically, then cool. In the short term the network supports fewer people/companies. Over time we can expand and support more and more.

 - Digital cash, you control your money 
 - Transfers fast, from 0-10 minutes
 - Programmable money, on the blockchain nobody cares if you're a toaster, or six years old, or have poor credit

Coinage had value due to the precious metals they were made from. Universal coin sizes made it so people didn't have to carry scales around with them. During the gold rush, entire towns used raw gold as currency - no coin sizes, and no state stampings, just metal.

But as pointed out, crypto is a protocol. Just as MySpace and Facebook run using TCP/IP, and websites come and go, exchanges can disappear without affecting the Bitcoin blockchain underneath. 
Software *is always improving*. Using Bitcoin today is equivalent to email in 1997, logging into a UNIX prompt, learning basic text editing in PINE, and dealing with all manner of strange computer-specific hurdles.

There are people working to make sure Bitcoin sneaks into the corners of the financial markets to work its magic, and people with a vested interest in it tanking to preserve their seat in castle status quo. 
Gentlemen, place your bets.

Jstolfi has a point here. There is no such thing as 'intrinsic value' we can't have value in a vacuum - something has value only in relation to something else (dollars, euros, gold, shares of apple stock, houses, collectible stamps...)

Yeah, no need to proselytize. I have plenty of friends and coworkers that snicker if Bitcoin comes up in conversation. The general attitude is as if you'd suggested chipping in Warcraft gold to pay your share of the bar tab. 
These same people come out of the woodwork asking how to buy and use them when the price starts rocketing up.

It certainly is interesting watching this develop. The least little scrap of doubt is echoed on every media outlet driving the price further down.

Nah, it doesn't have anything to do with the price, people were buying at $100, $1,000 and will continue to buy at $10,000 and $100,000. That's just people kicking themselves for not buying earlier. 
People crying about "greed" are ignoring that the incentive structures in Bitcoin were specifically designed around greed and 'rational actors', for instance, that more than 51% of nodes or miners would not seek to destroy their investment.

You're seeing resistance because most people on this sub are firmly in the 'they don't' camp, and it's already been debated repeatedly.

Also funny because Bitcoin was designed to mimic gold digitally, ie 'mining' based on a finite/dwindling supply, minting into 'coins', highly divisible, store of value (can't be inflated), not tied to a specific country, economy or ideology.

Eh, ok fine, this is indeed a use case. If I'm a hacker and can remotely crack a server and hold it hostage, yes, Bitcoin is preferable to a bank account or meeting in person to hand over a briefcase of money. 
It's a tool. I can use a hammer to hammer nails into drywall or helpless, fuzzy bunnies. Or nail bunnies into drywall in sequence around my apartment. In this case 'bunnies' represent transactions, and the nails are proof of work. Once nailed to the wall, a bunny can't be un-nailed, it's a permanent record. The trick would be convincing everyone to duplicate this sequence in every apartment so you don't have a single point of failure for the Feds or SPCA to shut down your Bunnychain.

You're forgetting something here - value is relative. In the  spectacular endgame event of Bitcoin gaining this sort of widespread adoption, the dollar (and most currencies) would be experiencing extreme hyperinflation. 
Nobody would be willing to part with their Bitcoins for fiat, at any price.

Dear god man. If the blockchain splits the fork is coded to not happen until 75% are using the new XT codebase. The hashing power splits with it, so at 75%/25%. Confirmation times on the new chain are now 13-15 minutes, and 40 minutes+ on the old chain.

I agree with this - for the record, I think it much more likely that Bitcoin becomes 'another place to store purchasing power' outside of fiat like stocks, commodities and gold rather than replaces all fiat. Even 1% of the gold market is a huge bump in Bitcoin's price (napkin math - gold is a 6 trillion market, Bitcoin 6 billion, 1% of 6 trillion is 60 billion, divided by 21 million coins is uh... $3k a coin?)
People buying Bitcoin right now don't need to be sure it will be around in 20 years to make money. The just need to know if it's over or under valued to place their bets. And admittedly the conversation about figuring out what a Bitcoin is worth rapidly devolves down to 'it's worth what people think it is'.

Satoshi *did* leave us a link to [this article]( in the genesis block. You can interpret that however you like, but I think it's pretty clear Satoshi was sick of citizens being forced into using a currency the state [regularly inflates]( at whim. 
A payment system would be selling ourselves short. They can be built on top of any currency - you can cash out your PayPal account in dollars, yen or euros. Bitcoin is a new, decentralized *world reserve currency* not under the control of any one government. That's never been done successfully before, it's revolutionary. The ever-increasing flow of fiat into Bitcoin is central banks getting Ubered. 
Scaling problems don't really worry me, we just doubled the throughput a few months ago, and have all manner of altcoins for smaller amounts.

I keep seeing the narrative that in the event of a hard fork we'll end up with two versions of Bitcoin, with the ability to use and sell on both chains. This is incorrect. 
*All* hard fork proposals include the condition that no fork occurs until a 75% threshold (or higher) is reached. In that case, the time to confirm on the 25% chain immediately goes to hours a block, and months for difficulty to readjust. Miners, not wanting to receive a tiny fraction of what they were making will rapidly switch to the larger chain, causing even slower times on the losing chain, and a vicious cycle as more and more miners abandon that chain. 
The smaller chain will die in perhaps a day. With more coordination, a matter of hours.

Ha, I agree, but there will be backlash. Even average Joe suddenly gets some mighty crafty ideas when his hard-earned money is on the line. I think it would take years, if not a generation to phase out bills. 
In the meantime as they increasingly ban smaller and smaller cash  transactions and increase (decrease?) negative interest rates, that wealth gets increasingly pushed into gray/black markets. People will start aggressively paying off debt rather than leaving money sit in banks, pay bills yearly instead of monthly, doing little trades with their neighbors for goods and services, selling household stuff on Craigslist in person, growing their own food in backyards, stocking up on things that hold value well - prepaid cards, metal coins, jewelry, cars and so on. Hell, even an Amazon gift card for $100 is pretty close to $100 for purposes of barter. 
I think the banks will be surprised how creative people can get when squeezed like this. People *hate* the banks. Wall Street syphoned off people's home equity and retirement in 2008 and now with that gone they want to skim off my checking account? I doubt people will just suck it up and go 'oh well, I just lost 2% of my paycheck due to negative interest rates this month, what can 'ya do?'

Yeah, this has nothing to do with convenience. 
Recap: first Wall St. got average Joe investor used to a 30-50% 'haircut' on their retirement every eight years via the stock market. Next the government socialized losses after the banks went after house equity - "Oh oops, maybe we went a little overboard with those subprime loans! It's cool, I've got some friends who can help out there." With ~50% of Average Joe's investments and equity syphoned off and the economy wobbling, we started cranking up the money supply via quantitative easing forcing wealth into riskier investments to prop up the stock market.
With the stock marketing doing another eight-year dump and Average Joe cleaned out they cooked up another idea, NIRP. Slowly get people used to having a little skimmed off their savings and checking accounts. The only catch - this doesn't work on cash hidden under a mattress, and a true bank run would cause another wave of too-big-to-fail crashes... so, as insane as it sounds, outlaw cash. 
The publicly stated excuse they're going to repeat ad nauseum until people start to believe it: 'only criminals and terrorists use cash!' 
@_date: 2015-07-07 19:54:20
This is essentially it. This attack rapidly becomes more expensive over time as people raise transaction fees. Average Joe doesn't care if his transaction costs $0.10 instead of $0.02. The attacker probably cares that it just burned half a million dollars, and will have to keep doubling it each day to keep up the attack. 
In the meantime, the attacker is burning through money, and people holding Bitcoins watch the price go up. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 18:33:51


This is borderline racism. You can't say Bitcoin is borderless and global in one breath and then complain that China is embracing it. China is huge, 20% of the world's population, has extremely cheap government-subsidized electricity, and a strong manufacturing sector, so mining equipment doesn't have to be shipped as far.
It's a perfect environment for maximizing revenue from mining, so market forces have pushed it there. If China cracked down, the hash rate would fall, individual miners would point to other pools and mining would shift to other countries. If you don't like it, compete. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 22:23:34
If one country cracks down, other countries can adopt a more tolerant attitude and leapfrog the dollar. People holding Bitcoins will  just to other countries.

Bitcoin becomes stronger with more adoption, not weaker. 
Another minor point - the block size is a limit on the currency/commodity's velocity, not adoption. The fee market proponents have a point - as fees go up people will think twice about doing transactions unless really necessary. The second layer of exchanges and services start to look more appealing. 
As an extreme example - someone pulls a pile of money out of our crashing stock market and buys $100k of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge off Coinbase, transfers to a Ledger wallet, then back to Coinbase to sell five years later has done a whopping *two* transactions. 
Depending on your own estimates of 'users' vs 'hodlers' the 70% capacity gains from SegWit, and potential 100% gains from a future 2MB hard fork could allow for quite a lot more users (and associated market cap increase) than the implied 3-4x gains. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 21:48:11


Of course, this is ideal. The people invested in the current corrupt system, the status quo types, the clueless, or those susceptible to media FUD get left behind. Meanwhile those capable of understanding the tech, the forward-thinking, innovative types embrace it, help build out the infrastructure and hoard coins, more adopters get exposed and keep trickling in and the price keeps ticking up. 
The more they try to tie Bitcoin to drugs, terrorism and so on, the more people's ears perk up. The brighter folks go 'man, the FED, banks and gov are *really* going out of their way to demonize this thing, I wonder why it's such a threat?' 
@_date: 2016-02-27 00:19:41


At what market cap do you think they'd take notice? I think they're already taking a healthy interest in the technology considering [they paid RAND a few million]( to do a thorough assessment of the tech, particularly with an eye to strengths and weaknesses.  
Bitcoin is a pretty easy way to move wealth outside of the current system where it (potentially) can't be tracked, hence the use in dark markets. That represents a potential threat to all manner of capital controls, taxation, domestic and foreign monetary policy and the efforts of the FED to maintain inflation targets. 
The more people watch the price rise the more likely they'll want a piece of the action. I don't think it's a conspiracy theory to suggest world governments are taking an interest, or that there could be groups trying to slow adoption by various means.

Well, with SegWit rolling out we'll have room for roughly twice the velocity. With the halving, we're looking at half the supply/inflation rate. Either way you slice it, we're looking at longer term growth of 2x to 4x the market cap this year.

Risk. Real or perceived. Metal markets are just as manipulated as anything else, most people would opt for cash and just take their 2-4% inflation hit a year. Governments know this and keep trying to limit hoarding.
As the masses panic, basically *everything* tanks as people scramble for the exits. These next few years are going to be a clusterfuck no matter how you slice it. We tried to buy our way out of a market crash in 2008 and just raised the stakes. Expect all manner of bizarre crap: zero interest rates, Chinese businesses deleveraging, currency wars, oil prices crashing, stocks crashing.  'Safe' assets like bonds are next on the chopping block, and precious metals and real estate will get their turn later on. 
There's nowhere to hide - no place to put wealth where someone can't screw with it. And re:Bitcoin, it's still a long-term bet. Until liquidity goes way, way up by getting coins into more hands, a few whales can move the price on a whim.

Eh, it's basically a stock tip. Once you get out of your 20's and have a little extra money to play around with, you look for investments, and there's always that one guy at the party telling you he knows a guy who knows a guy who got inside information on Pollo Loco, or Tesla, or whatever and that you should buy.
80% of the time the stock goes down of course, you go back to the guy and ask 'so... I lost a grand in three months, why did you think it would go up?' and find out there was literally no metric, analysis, fundamentals etc involved whatsoever, just a rumor, or someone pumping their own investment. So now you sort of hate that guy.
For friends that actually express some interest in the space, I'll go through the basics of how the tech works. If they want to invest, you need to be extremely clear: it's extremely volatile, expect 50% or higher price swings. The downside is a complete loss of your investment. The upside is... potentially *really* high if adoption continues to increase. 
There are a group of investors during the 2014 run up to $1200, I'd guess most were shaken out of the market on the slide back down to $200, but most people have done quite well. Bitcoin has gone up in price every year of its existence except for one.

I don't know why people get hung up on this comparison. It's like saying an F-16 goes mach 2 (1500 mph), while your BMW goes 1/10th that speed, therefore cars are useless. 
VISA is a way of moving fiat around, quickly, and encourage consumers running themselves into debt. It's perfectly fine for lots of small payments. It has all the risks of the fiat currency it's denominated in, as well as all the risks of VISA being a corporation (assets can be seized, monitored, tracked, rejected, turned over to the government etc). 
Bitcoin is digital gold. It's outside the reach of governments, pseudo-anonymous, fixed supply, market-based price and is a bearer instrument. It's a hedge against things like quantitative easing/inflation. My credit card charges me 7.9% APR. My Bitcoin balance just went *up* 3.8% in the past 24 hours. 
Bitcoin transactions are poised to double this year, possibly quadruple, and scale along with increases in Internet bandwidth (~15-20%/year). I'd be curious how many transactions per second physical gold has, worldwide, but I'd bet it's less than five a second.

This is actually a pretty solid post, here are my own thoughts on things going down. 
1) The US continues QE to the tune of $90 billion a month, eroding the value of the dollar by 2-5% a year. The EU and most countries follow suit, and we have a few more stock market crashes a'la China, where the wealthy *were* trying to preserve purchasing power. 
2) Regarding technological limitations - Internet speeds and hard drive space increase about 15-20% a year. In 20 years you go from a 9600 baud modem that takes 20s to load a BBS to a 50/50 Mbps FIOS connection for $50/month. 
I'm the first to admit in 10-20 years a *lot* of things could change. Snapchat valuation sure - Bitcoin is currently just a little campfire sputtering in the wind, but I was around when it was a tiny little candle (taco truck valuation) and didn't think it would make it this far either, so we'll see.

The [whitepaper]( was written both before miners and nodes were separate entities, and before CPUs were replaced by ASICs, but there's nothing in the whitepaper alluding to some democratic voting process for upgrading the software. 
The word 'vote' appears three times:
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it."
"Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."
In both instances 'voting' is referring to agreeing on the current state of the blockchain, not upgrading/changing software. 
I don't think Satoshi thought through the ramifications of splitting nodes and mining, but I'd say pb1x is correct here. Per Satoshi, you 'vote' by proof of work (mining/hash power).

Worth mentioning, parts of Bitcoin stand up better than others, and there's no scenario where someone just sweeps everyone's coins into the void.
[Here's a decent overview]( of the topic.
"ECDSA is most definitely broken by QC's, as well as just most asymmetric crypto algorithms on which internet security relies.  But Bitcoin is better prepared to deal with QCs than most other crypto systems: (1) if you never reuse addresses, then no one knows your public keys and thus there's nothing for a QC to solve.  By the time someone gets your public keys, you've already spent the funds, (2) the crypto algorithms in Bitcoin can be changed to quantum-resistant ones.  Given that we'll probably have two decades advance notice before QCs with enough qubits exist to even threaten Bitcoin, we'll have plenty of time to make the switch."

This is so backwards it's borderline 'blaming the victim'. The powers that be screwed the pooch decades ago - instead of raising taxes years ago, austerity measures and getting budgets under control they decided to print more money and erode the dollar's purchasing power slowly enough that people hopefully wouldn't notice. Then in 2009 they jacked up the printing presses to 11 printing [$90 billion a month for three years]( 
Well guess what, that debt is now [$21.7 trillion]( and counting, or $66,000 per US citizen, and there's arguably no way to pay it back. If they can't, option two will be 'destroy the value of the currency'. 
Imagine you had a friend who instead of getting his life in order just decided to party and live it up and put everything on credit cards until they're maxed out, then starts borrowing money from friends. When you decline to give him money, he says 'you're just hoping my life is ruined so you can gloat about how successful you are compared to me!' Right, good luck with that.

This is my own (borderline tinfoil hat) opinion, but the blocksize debate has all the trappings of a classic [Divide et Impera]( technique used to slow or disrupt discussion and encourage infighting. It was all but spelled out in the [RAND report]( on virtual currencies. 
Which is strange right? I mean, I can't think of any corporate or political entities that stand to lose anything by the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Not a single one. /s 
We're all on the same team here. The code is open source. Write some code, draft up a BIP, promote it. If you think Bitcoin just needs a 2MB or scaling block size to be perfect, make an altcoin. If you're correct, value will naturally flow over into it over time.

Ok, I can't believe I'm doing this, but to play devil's advocate for the FED (!) - this isn't really their fault. They don't have any options left. 
The root problem here is the top-heavy nature of society due to the baby boomer generation. They're retiring in one gigantic lump, punching a massive hole in the economy. With productivity decreasing, everyone panics because without that 2% growth, that [$18.8 trillion]( in debt becomes a massive freaking problem. We've been kicking the can down the road by printing money and strangling the life out of the younger generations. Per [2cool2fish]( above, the debt must be destroyed or the value of the currency must be destroyed. 
There isn't anything we can do but ride it out over the next ~20 years. (As a whole) people are going to have to get used to a drop in standard of living. Quantitative easing increases wealth disparity and creates asset bubbles. Stocks are absurdly priced at the moment. NIRP punishes savers and the War on Cash is going to pan out much like the War on Drugs - i.e. police raids, only they take your safe instead of your pot. People with any sense will store wealth elsewhere - overseas, precious metals, (*cough*) Bitcoin, collectibles, art etc.
People are also switching to services instead of purchases: renting instead of owning, bartering, cooking instead of eating out, Uber and a bike instead of owning a car, Netflix instead of cable, delaying marriage and kids, living with five smelly roommates and so on (a lot of the stuff Millennials have already figured out).
The markets will crash regardless of all these antics, much of this debt will default, the elite will scoop up 'real' assets at bargain-basement fire sale prices, and things will slowly recover. But it's going to be a while.

 - The Dow dropped [777 points]( the largest drop in history.
 - Wiped out [5.5 million jobs]( peaking unemployment at [10.1%]( to settle at 8.1% today.
 - Foreclosures went up [88%]( kicking 860,000 people out of their homes and wiping out [$19.2 trillion]( in household wealth, with [7.5 million]( or 8.6% of all homeowners underwater on their mortgage.

Tell that to Greece and Cyprus. And in case you think the US would never do bail-ins, you should Google the Dodd-Frank Act. As of 2010, depositors are now on the hook in the event of another 2007 style bank run.
"Statutory bail-ins, as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, amount to forcing a failed institution’s shareholders back into a similar double liability exposure situation should a financial institution fail—and by extension, the bank depositors as well. Is it really possible that our current laws could subject the public to this sort of unexpected dilemma? Unfortunately it is."

This is an important point, governments play a bit of a shell game here reporting actual inflation rates, frequently changing the basket of things they measure average prices on.
I received a 4% raise this year at work, and I’m basically just treading water. My three largest expenses, which comprise about 2/3rds of my income: rent in a major city, groceries and healthcare are all up well over 5%, closer to 10% year over year, yet if you haggle with your employer they’ll swear up and down inflation is only 2% a year, citing ‘official’ government stats.

This post x100. 
Bitcoin was created *expressly* to replace these rent-seeking financial middlemen that act like having sole control of your own wealth is *like totes a bad idea, just trust us ok?* while double-dipping selling your purchasing habits to companies. If you go back to using a credit or debit card for the sake of convenience, congrats, you've just utterly missed the point of this revolutionary technology, given control of your wealth back to the overlords and put your shackles back on. 
It's not difficult: buy Bitcoin from one of the dozens of exchanges, move them to a wallet you (and you alone) control. Buy things directly with Bitcoin. The fees per transaction are about [$0.10 each]( right now. For anything under $20, maybe try out the [Lightning Network]( for tiny sub-$0.01 fees. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 01:13:52
Ok, so someone here needs to say this. This is not how you will improve your life. Buying Bitcoin with money you'd need for an emergency, bills or savings is akin to gambling.
The breakdown goes like this. First, get a job and start saving for 2-4 months salary liquid. That's your 'oh crap' emergency fund in case you lose your job or have an unexpected medical bill, car repair etc. You should really be saving 5-15% of every paycheck. If you can't save that much, you're living beyond your means and ease up on the lifestyle stuff: restaurants, video games, vacations, new phones/computers/TVs, drinking, smoking... all the fluff that's just 'nice to haves'. That stuff will come later. 
Second, with an emergency fund ready to go, next split that 5-15% 50/50 between a 401k or IRA (usually depending on if your employer matches contributions) and paying off debt, starting with the highest interest rate debt first, usually credit cards, then car payments, then student loans. Some people put their mortgage next, but it does depend on your circumstances. 
Third, once you're debt-free, you can start investing in things that are at a variety of risk/reward profiles like individual stock picks, index funds, mutual funds, bonds, metals, CDs, starting a business etc. Risk tolerance varies greatly from person to person, but generally low risk means low reward and likewise high risk high reward.
Lastly, once you have all these ducks in a row, an emergency fund, 401k, IRA, stocks and *still* have money left over you don't know what to do with, *now* you can start to consider extremely risky investments like Bitcoin, venture capital investing and the like. These are your 'shoot for the fences, I don't care if all this money vaporizes' investments. They're *dead last* on this investing/money hierarchy, and most people even with solid careers don't get here until their 30's or 40's.

Of course, it goes against everything they've learned their entire career. 'Companies' are a centralizing play in the market. Think up your product/service, protect it with patents and copyrights, hire your MBAs, programmers and sales team, then gobble up as much market share as quickly as you can, squash/buy competitors. Hang in there long enough to get that stock exit before some market shift or new technology puts you out of business, then repeat. The TBTF banks added in some extra sauce - government lobbying and protectionism, and have tried to tell the populace 'no seriously, you can't let us go out of business or the world will collapse. [Nine  trillion]( in taxpayer money should do it. Sweet, thanks.' 
The very notion of decentralizing - that millions of individuals using Bitcoin have massive advantages over a company just doesn't make sense to them. It's not how they think or view the world. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 01:58:01


So, I pretty much refuse to believe this. If you're really in that boat, you've likely made lifestyle choices you couldn't afford, running up debt to the point where you should consider bankruptcy and starting over, inability to hold a job long-term (usually physical/mental health issues),or you just have never learned to hold yourself accountable to a budget instead of impulse purchasing. 
There are *really* drastic things you can do to reduce your living expenses: living with your parents, or five smelly Millennial roommates, riding a bike to work instead of owning a car, getting a second job, eating rice and veggies for every meal (buy in bulk), going to a library instead of buying books, games and movies and/or just plain literally turning down every opportunity to have fun. 
Even one of these drastic measures will likely mean you can save 15% of your income, doing all of them is more like 50% depending on where you live. Instead, people just go 'oh I could never live with my parents' or 'I absolutely *need* my morning latte' and keep falling behind.

I see this argument a lot, but Bitcoin is an Internet *protocol* like TCP, UDP or SMTP, not a website. While websites like MySpace, Facebook or Twitter come and go, all of them run via those basic protocols. 
The lure of the altcoins is always the same: everyone missed the boat in 2010-11 and desperately wants a do-over where they can get in early on the new hot thing that then rises exponentially, and it’s not going to happen, Bitcoin would simply fold that innovation or new feature back into its code base. It’s been ten years, and Bitcoin still is the most decentralized, strongest security, most developers, largest market cap, most merchant adoption, etc.

This sounds harsh, but it's correct - you can't save people from themselves. 
Anyone remember Oprah? She would have these guests come on with sob stories - families drowning in tens of thousands of debt, credit cards, medical bills, layoff, or just unlucky circumstances. She famously took a bunch of them and paid off all their debt for them - it's a drop in the bucket, she's worth billions. 
She stopped doing it after a couple of years, because something like 80% of people ended up with the *same* amount of debt (or more) within 1-2 years. The debt was erased, but they hadn't learned to budget. Hell, they probably learned that when things get tough, someone just bails you out. 
Bitcoin is an amazing technology, but that left slice of the bell curve is never going to understand how/why it works. They'll never understand inflation, wealth, quantitative easing, fiat currencies, macroeconomics or why commodities/stocks/metals/real estate has  'value' in the first place.

Well, lets do the math. The current blockchain, after seven years, is about 82GB, and growing by a maximum of 1MB every ten minutes, 144MB per day, or 52GB a year assuming completely full blocks.
A 4TB hard drive is [$130]( or $0.0325 cents per gig. So storing the existing blockchain will cost you a whopping $2.67. But - don't forget to set aside another $1.69 per year. 
On the bright side, hard drive prices per gig are always going down, so these costs should improve over time.

Honestly? Probably never. There's money to be made in this FUD. For those of us that have been in this space a while, we've already seen a half dozen attempts fail: Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, 'Emergent Consensus', Bitcoin Cash and now SegWit2x. 
Notice how these failed forks always seem to contain the word 'Bitcoin' in them? They're fighting to control the brand name, which has value. Bitcoin isn't a corporation. It doesn't have a team of marketers to file for trademarks, copyrights, and logos, or a team of lawyers to send out cease and desist orders and sue people for trying to pass off an inferior clone as the real thing. 
Bitcoin software updates require support from nodes, exchanges, developers, users *and* miners, *by design*. It's hard to update Bitcoin *on purpose*, i.e. a feature, not a bug. Some people bought in to the narrative of 'OMG we need bigger blocks now or the sky will fall!', but it was an carefully orchestrated attempt by one large miner to fool users into giving them more power. 
SegWit2X is headed for the dustbin with the rest of these failed takeover attempts.

Seriously guys, avoid day-trading. There's a reason HODL is a meme here. You can agonize over if Ethereum is syphoning off market share, the DAO will impact prices, exchanges going offline, governments outlawing it, pending scaling upgrades, private bankcoins, hacks, thefts, political forking and overhyped alts all you want, it's all just noise. The concept is solid, proven, but adoption takes time.
The way you make money is to wait for the next spike, i.e. years. We've had ~~four~~ five major 10x (or higher) bubbles and crashes. I stressed and theorized like crazy watching things crash from $214 down to $88. I had friends call me up yelling/crying because they lost thousands of dollars, panicked and sold, and friends who thought they were geniuses making an extra $400 timing a dip... and it was an utter waste of time and effort. The two friends that don't handle stress well sold around $100 after chewing me out on the phone, and then watched in horror as Bitcoin went from $90 to $1150.
The friends that did a little research, bought what they could and just went on with their life, not checking the chart every day, assuming I'd let them know if something interesting happened made a lot of money. (Ok, to be fair here, one got Gox'd.)
Bitcoin is still in relatively few hands. These whales wait for anything resembling bad news and cause 20% crashes to buy in lower. Ignore it. Get off r/bitcoin and go play video games and drink and try new restaurants and stuff. The next spike is coming.
Carry on. :)

IMHO, the 2017 altcoin rise was an organized pump and dump, a reaction to the threat of Segwit adding a ton of features, secondary layer scaling and removing the [ASICBoost]( mining advantage. A rogue group engineered a social media campaign, paid articles, an 'alternative' Reddit forum and [transaction spam]( to claim that Bitcoin couldn't scale, fees were too high and that any minute now some altcoin would replace it via 'the flippening'. 
FUD piled on, and the threat of multiple contentious forks like [Segwit2X]( and BCash, again with a narrative of 'Bitcoin is dying! Diversify into altcoins now!' then as people watch the price of alts slowly creep up, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. BCash allowed a group of miners to keep their ASICBoost advantage and Coinbase to sneak in a little [insider trading]( but the coin offers nothing a dozen other alts also have, and now needs constant cash injections to keep market share. 
The Lightning Network is now at [818 nodes]( and growing by a dozen a day or so. Fees on the main chain are around [$0.50 - 1.00]( a transaction again. 
TLDR: I can't see into the future, but my money is on the Lightning Network, sidechains and new privacy-related tech and scripts replacing *most* of the altcoins within the next year or so.

Don't get me wrong, I own a substantial amount of Scamcoins, and I still feel that warm fuzzy satisfaction each time they help expose another scammer, but I'd really suggest everyone look into PonziCoin. 
The developers here have finally worked out a way to harness the power of Ponzi schemes into a blockchain. When a new investor buy an amount of PonziCoins, the software automatically creates additional PonziCoins and sends them to the earliest investors. For instance, buy 50 PonziCoins, and the earliest 50 investors *each* receive an additional PonziCoin.
And, as you can imagine, it really pays to get into this system early. Check them out on Bitfinex, don't buy more than you can afford to lose!

It's not about ideology, political posturing or personal attacks. The lack of thinking through the EDA in BCash has doomed that coin to the altcoin trash bin.

If Coinbase (or any exchange) still try to pass of that fork as 'Bitcoin' it could cause replay attacks, lost coins, stolen coins and a generalized lost faith in crypto, dropping the whole market.

The last Bitcoin Core update had about 80 developers from all over the world contributing to the project, thousands of commits, dozens of programmers discussing ideas, writing and reviewing code, regression testing, beating on TestNet etc. 
Scratch the surface, and these scamcoins have a developer, sometimes two, being paid by one scam artist (usually made rich by Bitcoin in the first place) that thinks they can make a quick buck fleecing newbs, forking off and dumping coins on the market before people can figure out how to split their coins. Features and development are done behind closed doors or invite-only. In some cases Bitcoin developers have had to go in and nicely point out bugs in the code so the project doesn't explode right out of the gate.

It re-introduces counterparty risk and the need to trust back into a system designed to allow you to transact P2P trustlessly. 
There is no 'almost owning coins' in Bitcoin. You either have the private keys (you own Bitcoins) or you don't (you don't own Bitcoins, you own IOUs). People that want bitcoins but don't want to shoulder the responsibility of safeguarding keys are going to get suckered into derivatives - ETFs and other 'paper coins' for retirement thinking they're equivalent.
What if your government outlaws cryptography, or seizes the coins, or an insider or hacker steals them, or there's a fork and they choose the wrong side, or the ETF parent company goes bankrupt? 'Oh then I just sue them to get my money back!'
Yeah, sue them. Remember MtGox? Hackers stole [$460 million]( All the yelling, lawsuits, trials, drama, news headlines, conspiracy theories and so on can't bring back those coins, the keys are gone, the company insolvent. It's already been three years, and in another 4-5, after the lawyers get their fees people will get pennies on the dollar, if anything.
This is the [history of banking]( and the origin of every liquidity crisis, some entity going 'we'll just hold and protect your x for a small fee, and dole them out when you need them.' Then loan them out in a fractional reserve environment, and crash and burn if too many people request ownership at the same time.

"What is it admiral?"
"Comscan reports are in, it looks like we've shaken out pretty much all the weak hands forcing the price down to $5500."

I see this a lot: in short, because you have to guess correctly twice in a row, in a random market. The shorter the timeframe, the more randomness is involved. How often do you think you could correctly call two coin tosses in a row?
Say Bitcoin is $5500 and for some reason I just *feel* a crash coming on because eh, it's gone up 25% in a week. So I sell hoping to buy in lower. If I mistimed this sell and Bitcoin goes to $6000, I have to panic buy in at a loss.
But suppose I called that top right and it crashes... well now I have to call the bottom correctly. Do I buy in at $5200? $5000? $4500? If I guess wrong this second round, hoping to buy at $5000 but it bounces at $5200 (like it did today), again I have to panic buy back in at a loss, or wait patiently for another crash which may or may not happen. 
There's a reason that [90% of day traders lose money]( 'Technical analysis' is really just reading tea leaves - humans are biologically [wired to see patterns]( in random data.

Close, this war is about controlling the brand - the name 'Bitcoin' has value, people want them. If you could get enough exchanges to pretend that Seg2X is an 'upgrade' instead of an altcoin you can pass off that altcoin *as* Bitcoin, and as a side benefit wrestle away control of development/github and shift development into corporate hands. Seg2X proponents will bend over backwards trying to claim 'nobody owns the name Bitcoin!' ignoring that newbs entering the space would be pretty pissed if some exchange gave them Seg2X coins instead of the Bitcoins they wanted. 
The plan with all these attempts (Bitcoin Classic, XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, Emergent Consensus, BCash) was to wrestle away control at best, or failing that, sow enough discord and FUD to make people hedge their bets, driving up altcoin prices. Which, looking at the charts this year, is to some extent working. 
PSA: get your coins off the exchanges (especially Coinbase) into a wallet you control, [run a 0.15.0.1 node]( and if this fork actually happens, sell your Seg2X coins for actual Bitcoins.

Full 1MB blocks were around 4-5 transactions per second. SegWit is roughly an 80% gain if/when the ecosystem switches over, so if we go with 9tps, that's (9 x 60 x 60 x 24) 777,600 transactions a day.

This is a common misconception, particularly in the US and Europe who have enjoyed (relatively) stable currencies. The average life expectancy of a fiat currency is [27 years]( That's roughly enough time to scam each generation once. 
The US dollar has had a pretty good run, but the clock has been ticking ever since FDR took it off the gold standard in [1933]( And by 'pretty good run' I mean, it's lost about [95%]( of its purchasing power.

Whew, oh boy right out of the gate we're off to a rocky start. He dives right into the [intrinsic value fallacy]( Nothing has intrinsic value, value is established by supply and demand in a market. If we discover a new billion ton vein of gold, or asteroid mining or whatever, the value of gold goes down, or a breakthrough in solar cell and battery technology could make the price of oil go down. 
Second, while correct that gold is a [commodity]( fiat currency, 99.9% of the currency currently used, is not, it's debt based, and still functions (relatively) well. Fiat means 'faith' and even [small changes in public confidence]( in the government issuing fiat money can make the fiat currency worthless. (To be fair, the same is true of Bitcoin.) 
Third, *most* industries benefit from non-physicality. This was the shift from paper money to digital money in the first place, only about [8%]( of money is now physical, and decreasing. There's a reason the highest net worth people are from the technology industry now, everything is shifting to leverage the Internet. Uber doesn't own cars, AirBnB doesn't own hotels, Wikipedia vs physical encyclopedias, more people get news from websites than newspapers, social media, etc. 
Schiff isn't open to cryptocurrency, it's a threat to his current business model. This is a salesman pitching us on the product he's selling, gold.

Based on the price this seems like early 2019 then. 
Then some poor high school kid discovers an old wallet from 2012, and has to spend several days painstakingly splitting and selling his Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Seg2X coins, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Advanced 2.0 ECC, Bitcoin Extreme Blocksize Edition, Bitcoin Emergent Consensus Tokens, Authentic Bitcoin, WrightCoins, VerCash, Satokens, and Bitcoin 2 Extreme Turbo Edition coins which combined allow him to buy 1.6% more Bitcoin off the 'any minute now Bitcoin will get MySpaced by this new ICO!' altcoin true believers.

Bitcoin derivatives are not a good thing, people should be extremely wary.
There is no 'almost' owning Bitcoins, you either have the private keys (you own Bitcoins) or you do not (you own IOUs). 'Paper Bitcoins', ETFs, or coins left on an exchange aren't yours. Most exchanges won't even regularly post proof of reserves to show they're not running a fractional reserve. If anything happens, the parent company goes bankrupt, is hacked, exit scams, a rogue developer moves the coins and flees to the Caribbean, the business follows the wrong fork, your local government outlaws crypto etc, you may be left with nothing in your retirement account. 
'But I'll just sue them in that case!' Right, see also: MtGOX, four years later and zip, nothing. At best, customers will get pennies on the dollar after the lawyers take their share. I also see a lot of 'this is fine, we want things to be easier so Average Joe can buy in!' I think that's setting ourselves up for a large market crash in the future when invariable some ETF has lax security and the coins are stolen and dumped back on the market. 
TLDR: Don't buy IOUs or ETFs. Buy actual coins and move them to a wallet you control.

Holy Christ. This comment boils down to 'if everyone would just pipe down and give me control of their money, this would go a lot smoother!'

Same here, some around $800. I was very, very clear with them though: 'This is experimental tech, and it directly takes on big banks and governments.

You know, after working with crypto, credit cards really start to look maddeningly insecure.
 - Your name and private key are *printed on the front of the card* making it impossible to do anonymous cash-style payments
 - All purchases are then tied to your identity, allowing the bank and merchants to track all purchases and sell the aggregate data to marketers
 - Personal information and credit card numbers are stored wherever you buy something in giant, typically insecure, honeypots. 143 million people in the case of Equifax, or roughly half the population of the United States
 - To increase security, they started requesting expiration dates to *prove* you owned the card, solving nothing
 - Then they added a second 3-4 digit code on the back, in case someone got a hold of the first two, again solving nothing
 - Now they're adding chips into the card to create a one-time use [encrypted code]( that couldn't be used for another transaction, solving nothing, because it can't be used for online transactions

TLDR: two statistical (auto-regressive integrated moving average) models predict $60,000 by 2020, and $1,000,000 by 2022-2023. 
I still think a million dollar coin is a little high, I’m not keen on seeing worldwide fiat hyperinflation, but $250,000-500,000 is doable. Then again, there are 21 million coins and about [36 million millionaires](  in the world, so that seems oddly balanced. YMMV.

You might want to consider doing a little more research here. This was debunked with the [failure of the R3 consortium]( A blockchain without a valuable token is a rather uninteresting data structure. It just pegs you as uninformed, like saying 'I'm really interested in this linked list technology.'
Here's a [straightforward four minute explanation]( at the 0.29 
mark. 
"And, in a desperate attempt to co-opt, embrace and extend this technology many of the companies and governments out there who are really looking at opportunities to create centralized version of this [Bitcoin] and are missing the central point which is decentralization, are grasping at this 'blockchain technology' and trying to circle the square. Trying to change this. So, there's a bit of bargaining going on, and when I say bargaining I'm referring to the five stages of grief."

Large players (whales) have been running this playbook in the stock market since the 1930's. It's called the [Wyckoff trading method]( 
It's dirt-simple:
 - Slowly buy up an asset over months to establish a position, the more illiquid/thinly traded the market the better 
 - Wait for a psychological peak/plateau ($5k) and/or a bit of negative news (China bans ICO's!)
 - Sell on multiple exchanges to give the appearance of weakness, trigger stop-loss orders to further tank the price
 - Buy up your original coins at a lower price for a substantial profit
 - Repeat the process, now with an even larger position 
It's even more effective if you can collude/organize with other whales. So seeing as traders have been doing this since the 1930's, what do you think the odds are this *isn't* being done in the new, basically unregulated, crypto space?
The solution? Move from the newbie 'panic sell' side to the Hodl/'buy the dip' side.

This is what [supply and demand]( looks like. Every time a government tries to 'regulate' a market, it wastes taxpayer money, taxpayers open up a black market, and ultimately the initiative fails.

People refer to counterparty risk as a need to trust a third party to make a transaction. You pay for my comic book collection via a third party - say PayPal, and PayPal can arbitrarily freeze those funds. 
The Bitcoin network is not arbitrary, it's all math. To change the software would involve a massive amount of agreement on a hard fork. It's unlikely thousands of people would collude to stop you from paying for comic books (or inflate the currency). 
In your example that's like saying that two banks exchanging money depend on the Swift network, which is a risk because somehow people could wrestle control of it.

For those just tuning in, here's a brief update. 
Humans did a pretty solid job of tracking who owed who what for thousands of years, until Roosevelt in [June of 1933]( decided the US was so big and powerful, its money didn't actually have to be backed by gold anymore. People would just trust  everything was working totally fine, and various people that didn't, were imprisoned, droned or freedom-bombed until their desert countries were a sheet of highly compliant glass.
A central bank was entrusted with the job of ~~fucking with~~ 'regulating' markets by both 1) adjusting interest rates, under the auspices of 'stimulating' or 'cooling off' the economy, and 2) printing more money, with no ability to audit how much is printed or why, a plan just as utterly insane as it sounds. 
To nobody's surprise whatsoever, the money printers and their friends and colleagues became fabulously wealthy, the economy always seemed to need 'stimulus', rates slowly creeped down to zero and stayed there, and with only one tool in the box and a looming [financial crisis]( central banks turned the money printers up to 11, roughly [$90 billion a month]( because YOLO, the next generation can sort this mess out, I'm going to play golf. 
Japan, the UK, EU and other countries were intrigued by this new 'print metric shit tons of money cause YOLO' technology, and created money printers of their own because well, who *wouldn't* want an ATM in their living room shitting out $34,722 a second in perpetuity. 
I'll refer to this scenario as 'The Trap', where the day-to-day effects for 98% of the population involve this strange, nagging doubt that no matter how hard you work, how far you advance in your career, or how much you save, it's like trying to blow up an inflatable mattress with several large holes in it. For the 2% that are making absurd amounts of money, their 'job' now is chiefly convincing the other 98% that everything is totally fine, unemployment is great, that [tsunami of debt]( shouldn't be a problem, [debt-to-GDP ratios]( can safely be ignored, Keynesian economics is 'on fleek' and inflation is only robbing you if you're a complete idiot and keep your money in cash instead of stocks, real estate, businesses and the like, and no, it's not their problem that [63% of people can't write a check for a $500 emergency]( maybe you should get a job you bum. 
Escaping The Trap is a nightmare that only a malevolent, vengeful God could have ideated and executed on. 
The easiest solution is to be born one of the 2%. Boom, problem solved, your life is now on easy mode, like an endless series of birthday parties that everyone knows you don't deserve.
Barring that, you can also get educated, learn about economics, game theory, foster a healthy skepticism for governments and corporations who want to 'help make things easier for you', fall into a well-paying job, save money, don't get sick and somehow, due to that nerd-friend taking about it until you just want him to shut the hell up, invest in a highly volatile, experimental, risky, brand-new asset class while ignoring all your clueless coworkers, friends and family telling you 'wait, isn't that illegal?', 'the Feds will just outlaw it' and 'you're throwing your money away on that ponzi thing', and invest a bit.

Honest question - why do we assume 7 transactions per second isn't enough? I realize say, Visa has 100x that, but I always figured we'd have Coinbase-type middlemen that would transact off-chain and update to the blockchain every hour or two. Bitcoin then becomes a giant, global Swift-style network across countries that takes 10-20 minutes to settle. 
Or another way - I doubt physical gold has more transactions than that per second, and it's worked fine as a store of value.

Bitcoin climbed from $0.01 to $1200 in a matter of years, purely through some esoteric grassroots combination of techy tinkering, greed, venture capital, black markets, speculation and FOMO. Now that we've gone from $1200 to $200 in a year people are calling fad/bubble (again), but this is the fourth 'bubble' to date. Personally the crash from $32 to $2 was more exciting imho. And there will be more. :)

Consider for just a moment if this is deliberate. Engineered. If Bitcoin is a threat to the status quo (a big if, sure) and it can't be bought out, hacked, regulated, lobbied, intimidated or carpet-bombed into a sheet of glass, it's going to have its reputation drug through the mud, and then it will be socially engineered.

I see this argument a lot, it's not a very good comparison. Bitcoin is an internet *protocol*, like TCP, UDP or SMTP. While websites like Facebook and MySpace and Twitter can come and go, *all* of them run on those basic Internet protocols. 
Everyone wants a 'do-over' where they get in at ground zero with a new coin that takes over. It's not going to happen - Bitcoin would just fold that innovation back into its code base. After 9 years and hundreds (thousands?) of altcoins tweaking the Bitcoin formula in various ways, Bitcoin still has the highest market cap, most nodes, developers, strongest security, user adoption, merchants, and decentralization.

Sure, why not? Free market, ie the blockchain is agnostic. I'm curious what the big players can step in and do here - consider it a stress test. If they can break everything, Bitcoin wasn't meant to last anyway. Pumping the price up to $20k then down to $50 again is fine by me.

Alts are purchased *with Bitcoin* which means they [rise and fall]( with Bitcoin as the unit of account (versus say, dollars), in addition to their own pump and dump arcs pushed to clueless investors via social media. 
In case you're just getting into the space, alts are basically a testbed for new code and ideas. 98% are 'we're totally Bitcoin 2.0!' scams. The few that have a legitimate use case (smart contracts (Ethereum), privacy (Monero/Dash), and scaling (Litecoin) will eventually be replaced when Bitcoin integrates that feature via new tech, sidechains and the Lightning Network.

I could be wrong, but if I'm right, they won't stop even after BCash and SegWit2X are dead in the water. We can then look forward to yet *another* takeover attempt.

This is massively understated. It took a genius to come up with all the moving parts and interrelations of Bitcoin. You need a high-level grasp of programming, cryptography, decentralized networks, race conditions, torrenting and game theory just to get started. 
And now Coinbase is going to patent years of Satoshi's work? Because she chose to keep it open source, decentralized and remove herself as a single point of failure? 
This is pretty abhorrent in my opinion.

Quick explanation: *all* the alts are dropping as people crowd back into Bitcoin to maximize the free dividends in November courtesy of the Seg2X fork. 
Minus Ripple, which has been on a tear lately. PSA: Ripple is completely centralized, it's barely a cryptocurrency. 
(EDIT: alternate theory: exchanges are starting to indicate Seg2X will be listed as an altcoin, dooming it to the trash bin with BCash. One more threat to Bitcoin falls by the wayside, people nervous about that buy back in, and the price continues to rise.)

In other news, the Great Depression never actually happened, it was just internal accounting, "a transfer of wealth from one location (the populace) to another location (the wealthy scooping up real assets at bargain basement prices, massively increasing wealth disparity). 
The [$90 billion]( a *month* the government printed to smooth over the 2008 financial crisis created bubbles, including in the stock market, as it always does. When those bubbles pop, it's going to cause massive suffering across the board. [Unemployment spikes]( bankruptcies, mortgages default, pensions can't be paid, depression, suicides increase.

According to the top Google articles, there is zero mention of a 'poorly run gold standard'. Top reasons include:
1. Stock Market Crash of 1929 - Many believe erroneously that the stock market crash that occurred on Black Tuesday, October 29, 1929 is one and the same with the Great Depression. In fact, it was one of the major causes that led to the Great Depression. Two months after the original crash in October, stockholders had lost more than $40 billion dollars. 
2. Bank Failures - Throughout the 1930s over 9,000 banks failed. Bank deposits were uninsured and thus as banks failed people simply lost their savings. Surviving banks, unsure of the economic situation and concerned for their own survival, stopped being as willing to create new loans. This exacerbated the situation leading to less and less expenditures.
3. Reduction in Purchasing Across the Board - With the stock market crash and the fears of further economic woes, individuals from all classes stopped purchasing items. This then led to a reduction in the number of items produced and thus a reduction in the workforce. As people lost their jobs, they were unable to keep up with paying for items they had bought through installment plans and their items were repossessed. More and more inventory began toaccumulate. The unemployment rate rose above 25% which meant, of course, even less spending to help alleviate the
economic situation.
4. American Economic Policy with Europe - As businesses began failing, the government created the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930 to help protect American companies. This charged a high tax for imports thereby leading to less trade between America and foreign countries along with some economic retaliation.
5. Drought Conditions - While not a direct cause of the Great Depression, the drought that occurred in the Mississippi Valley in 1930 was of such proportions that many could not even pay their taxes or other debts and had to sell their farms for no profit to themselves. 
Note that *all* of these conditions could easily happen again.

More blocksize/TPS FUD.
At 4TPS you can't currently put humanity's latte purchases on the blockchain, or 'Bitcoin is crap! It can't even compete with VISA!' which I always thought was a weird comparison. I doubt Satoshi set out to make 'a credit card, but like, with no middleman!' 
However, 4tps is far more than all the physical (not paper) transfers of gold, which governments/companies/people previously used to store wealth. Bitcoin is then used as a digital equivalent to gold. The counterargument here is if transaction demand outstrips supply, transactions go off-chain and Bitcoin becomes a settlement layer for a new crop of crypto-banks. Centralization is evil etc. 
The problem slowly goes away anyway as bandwidth/hard drive space increases, but well... we'd all like to be rich sooner rather than later.

Ok, so imagine a table with the 500 largest corporations and governments drafting up a new cryptocurrency with a 100 million coin cap. Start with:
 - (Premined) How many coins does each corporation/government get? 
 - Do they buy them? Who gets that money? 
 - Distribute them evenly, or based on some other metric like economy size? Won't larger countries expect a larger share? 
 - Fixed pool or constant inflation? Say a new country or corporation springs into existence. How do they get coins? (Otherwise we've massively advantaged the existing countries and corporations in existence. )
 - (Not premined) Who gets to mine? Is it just a land grab for who can build the biggest datacenters the quickest? Doesn't that favor the US again? Does the whole world shift all computing resources to mining because it's the most profitable thing to do? 
Etc. Governments literally kill each other for tiny shifts in power, control and resources. How in the hell would they resolve this?

I see less of that in the real world, and more just general misunderstanding about the tech. I had a conversation with a CTO and a developer of a large company yesterday over lunch, and Bitcoin came up (not by me). The conversation quickly went:
'Bitcoin, (eye roll). It can't last - it's just a matter of time until it's hacked.'
'Can it be hacked?'
'Of course, that Japanese exchange was hacked last year and the price is a fraction of what it was. That will just keep happening.'
This is a CTO - a very tech savvy programmer who still hasn't really understood the tech going on. And they're... not entirely incorrect. Thieves hacking the exchanges and dumping the coins will tank the price.

They're saying we can't currently use Bitcoin as a currency due to current transaction per second limits, we'd need 1000x or 10,000x the bandwidth, but we could use it like a digital bearer asset like gold. The amount of 'physical' (not paper/electronic) transactions of gold on the planet are way less than four a second.

I think we stand a chance at upgrading Bitcoin under the hood if it preserves the money people have invested in it. If we throw everything out, investors lose thousands, and then we expect those people to buy an altcoin, people are not going to invest anywhere near as much (if any) into buying v2.0 coins, knowing it's just a pump and dump cycle until version 3.0 comes out. 
Fewer people buying means lower market price, less adoption, less incentive to mine, which means less security, and so on. 
@_date: 2019-09-13 00:15:11


Alright, I'll bite here. The main difference between Bitcoin and all the altcoins is: Bitcoin was 100% fairly issued, there was zero developer pre-mine. Everyone that owns Bitcoin either mined for it, was gifted it, or (the vast majority) bought it at the market rate at the time. 
Bitcoin is sound money, it was not invented to solve wealth inequality. If you had the insight, intelligence or luck to mine or purchase a mountain of them early on when the project was in its infancy, and successfully hung on to them (no small feat not losing the keys, leaving them on a shady exchange, formatting the hard drive or selling once you're up 10x), you absolutely deserve every penny. If you want to dump that pile on the market to clean out stop-loss orders, go nuts. That's called buying and selling in a free market.

This reads like a 30 second spot for someone running for Congress.
"Mike Hearn vigorously worked against the interests of users. Is that the sort of man you want running your Bitcoin? Vote 'NO' on BIP 101."
It's like it's ingrained into people's minds to appoint representatives and choose sides and have them square off and debate and do battle. Bitcoin does not need representatives, or champions, or evil villains bent on destroying it, or plan A vs plan B. Bitcoin will carry on and adapt/adjust/fork to what the economic majority wants, completely by design. Think XT is evil? Well if 50% of people disagree, guess what. That's what Bitcoin is now.
There's no point to framing this as a political drama. If you can program, offer up a BIP and let miners and nodes decide. If you can't program, run a node to vote on existing BIPs.

Your answer is right in this statement. If an investor dumped in $50 million right now with such small order books/volatility the price would skyrocket and people that have been holding for years would sell, dropping the price back down. Smart money is not in the habit of giving millions to early adopters for the hell of it. 
Instead they're testing bottoms, collecting slowly on dips in an accumulation phase. These strategies have been around since the 1930's, they're designed to panic emotional people into selling:
After accumulation, then you pump things up, dump at the top, short, and repeat the process. The solution is not being emotional (a weak hand).

Bitcoin is not a new credit card or PayPal, it's a replacement for *fiat currencies* that, due to lack of competition within their respective countries, have adopted a monetary policy of rampant money-printing. 
Just as Visa, Mastercard and PayPal allow you to convert between dollars, Euros, pesos and yuan, in a few years they'll also allow you to convert in and out of Bitcoin. 
It's 100% opt-in. If you're happy with your credit card and fiat currency because you prefer the existing system, or can't see the benefits of a borderless, permissionless, un-censorable, un-taxable, deflationary currency, by all means keep using them.

I've seen napkin math about taking 1% of gold reserves,  theories about the collapse of fiat, theories about collectible markets on eBay, technical analysis about resistance, cycles and breakthrough, 'it has to be higher to move larger amounts of capital' and most recently 'I think $50 per transaction per second is about right.
How did we arrive at this (or any) price?
@_date: 2015-09-18 21:15:24


Of course. Bitcoin enthusiasts here are assuming this is a potential threat - that evil banks are trying to wrestle control of or create a new altcoin.
What's actually going on is marketing/sales types armed with the latest buzzword going to clueless suits and going "Dude, blockchains. It's the next thing, like the Internet. (Points to Wired article featuring shiny gold 3d coins.) You need one or your competitors will leapfrog you!"
"Oh man, our CEO reads Wired. Ok, we need one, where can we get blockchains? Can our current team of brogrammers make one?"
"Nope, too complicated, and you want that early mover advantage. Luckily I know some people. I'll have my people draft up a contract. Only a few million to get up and running and you'll be poised to revolutionize uh... money, banking. FinTech."

Good points on buyout and bankruptcy, I'd also add change of leadership, but more likely is just the natural life-cycle of a business. A small company starts off all agile, wades in fighting and innovating and either dies out, gets acquired or grows bigger.
After years of growth, corporations are just too big to really innovate and start coasting on their own hard-won market share, consumer sentiment and IP (branding, marketing, trademarks and patents). There's literally zero chance that at some point, given enough time, Coinbase won't use these patents to force smaller, more nimble companies out of the space if it stands to make them money.

It's a hobby of mine sending Bitcoins into the void. I get this Nietzsche-esque rush of nihilism, then a wave of solidarity/warm fuzzies knowing I just made everyone's coins slightly more valuable.
I imagine the Bitcoins meeting and hanging out in some mathematical black hole, beyond a spendable financial event horizon. Monetary ghosts that can no longer interact with the free market.
The problem is I need to burn more and more each time to get the same level of rush. It's not enough if I destroy a few hundred dollars worth anymore. :(

Most point to technical limitations in hard drive space and Internet bandwidth (which are both increasing fairly quickly).

Ha, I'm quoted in here. I'm Internet famous!
The printing press analogy is way off. If a blockchain is a press and coins are books, then these banks just made a press that only makes books you can read if you work at that particular bank.
Andreas said it pretty well in his last talk answering Max Keiser's question. It's like comparing your company-wide intranet to the Internet. If a walled-garden altcoin allows banks to settle fiat debts quicker or easier than Swift, of course, go nuts. But it's not competition - it has none of the advantages of Bitcoin (p2p, no middleman, open, borderless, permissionless, uncensorable, instantly transferrable, deflationary) and all of the disadvantages of fiat  (basically the exact opposite of all those).

If there's one thing I've learned from Bitcoin, it's never tell people how to invest their money. I all but begged people to invest at $200, friends, family, coworkers. Most took a look at the chart, saw it sliding down from $1200 and were like 'dude, looks like I missed the boat, this thing is done.' 
So now I have a dozen people pissed at me because they watched it climb 100x. Literally. They would be retired now, and Bitcoin is a forbidden topic lol. 
There's another group that did invest in the low hundreds. Those people are.. also pissed at me because I didn't flat-out order them to sell at $19,500, assuming I could see into the future precog-style. So they're pissed because their insane six-figure gains are now more modest five-figure gains. 
And there's a third group of friends who remember me talking about Bitcoin, watched the meteoric rise, and then bought in on the way up to $19,500... and are now pissed. I explained to them that I sat on a 70% loss for almost three years, from my initial buy-in around $800 down to $200, and... they don't care. They're pissed because, I don't know, they're going to have to get rich slowly.
Now I get to watch the *exact same thing happen* just with the numbers 10x higher than the last round. FUD, gloom and doom, Bitcoin is finished, it's all over, I mean, just look at that chart! Sigh.
TLDR: You can't win. Just buy Bitcoins and sit on them, act clueless when the topic comes up, get rich and tell no one, or everyone will hate you.

Not idiocy at all. As near as I can tell it's a concerted effort to derail (or possibly co-opt) the project, or at minimum slow adoption by applying a coating of fear/uncertainty/doubt. We've got one-month old accounts repeating the same talking points using the same tone, voice, grammar, even arguing with themselves, character assassination attempts on the most talented/influential devs, accounts attacking SegWit, nitpicking, trying to find flaws in code they have no hope of understanding, accusing it of being vaporware when the code is already there in front of them being reviewed...
I know it seems confusing, angering, even annoying to have the project attacked like this, but for me it's *really* exciting that people are so worked up over cryptocurrencies that they're actively trying to stifle its adoption. It's the most bullish signal I could ask for. Meanwhile, the price is up 3% in 24 hours.

Ha, some of Andrea's statements are so blunt I worry about him being 'disappeared' mysteriously. 
This was the eye-opening part of Bitcoin for me. Realizing that fiat currencies were decoupled from 'real' wealth allows governments to print money at will. 
I'm sure that tweak was originally well-intentioned, i.e. 'to smooth out boom and bust cycles' but it's now being used to enrich the wealthy 1% by robbing the other 99% of their purchasing power. It's already been shown QE *increases* [wealth disparity](

That's about it. No entity or group of people should be in charge of money creation.

Even assuming the Fed's [original intentions]( were good (debatable) you get things like "Oops, we thought Quantitative Easing would help, but it actually [wiped out the middle class]( It's like giving Trump the Infinity Gauntlet.

There's nothing to work out, this is marketing droids selling snake oil to suits that can't parse how/why blockchains work.

If you don't have sole control over your private keys, you don't have Bitcoins, you have I.O.U.s for Bitcoins. The exchange decides to honor your request or not.
If you leave coins on an exchange and they decide not to keep you as a customer, not to honor withdraw requests, go bankrupt/insolvent, get hacked, DDOS'd, get regulated/taxed/confiscated/shut down by their government or just plain decide to go rogue and steal everyone's coins and run, your coins are gone.

So, inflation, Quantitative Easing, Competitive Devaluation, Currency Wars, whatever the current marketing spin, it's just money printing, and the data is clear, [money printing causes wealth disparity]( 


Newly printed money is used to pump up asset and stock prices. The majority of Americans who can't afford to invest, the [57% that can't write a check for $500]( are converted into wage slaves, fighting with their boss for raises just to catch back up to inflation every year. 
Bitcoin has no inflation, it's fixed at 21 million coins. I have no doubt that can and will cause a myriad of other problems, no nation has ever attempted a deflationary currency, but it *will* fix the problem of an elite class of people enriching themselves at every financial crisis opportunity, syphoning off the purchasing power from a helpless majority.

Bitcoin was created and pitched as digital gold, a store of value outside the control of corporations, government and  inflation. 
Bitcoin could hard fork as long as people still have their x Bitcoins on Coinbase to spend after everything settled down, but a complete market collapse as people switched to an altcoin would be it for me and people I know that  invested. A tiny fraction of people might invest a tiny fraction of what they previously did hoping to pick a winner, but most would throw in the towel and put their money back into stocks.
If an altcoin can take over, tanking your investment, it could happen again a few years later with yet another altcoin... the remaining people actually trying to invest would live in fear, jumping ship at the least little perceived issue, or over to some shiny new feature a coin offered, getting suckered into pre-mined scams and pump and dumps, and volatility would make nearly all coins unusable. 
Sorry guys, we should avoid this. It would ruin cryptocurrencies' already wobbly reputation and set things back years.

Shorting (the post above me is totally solid, but more of an ELI18):
Imagine I borrow your Playstation 4 to play some Bloodborne when the price of a PS4 is $300, but instead of playing games, I immediately sell it on Craigslist for $300. A week later, Sony drops the price to $250. I then buy you a new PS4 for $250, replacing the one I owed you, and pocket $50.
That's shorting in a nutshell. You borrow a stock, commodity or asset, sell it, and agree to give it back at a later date, making money if the price goes down. In this case however - the price went way up, and the Bitcoin exchanges want their Bitcoins back (a 'call'), forcing people to buy a ton at market rate and give them back to the exchange, pumping the price a grand or so. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 21:02:17


Wot? This makes my brain hurt. If you have a handful of people in charge, you concentrate power, those people abuse that authority, are corruptible, charge for access and generally, inevitably fuck over the majority for their own gain. 
If you decentralize to where the 51% control things, the majority always wins. You have no central point to attack or corrupt, no king to sit in his castle and tax the masses. 
The idea here is the majority is never going to vote in something that will tank their own investment. The block size will be raised to allow Bitcoin to grow, we're just arguing about how much growth is ideal.

We have banks trying to make their own competing product before they experience their Uber moment, hackers emptying out exchanges due to half-assed code (or exchanges pretending to be hacked and exit scamming), various governments waffling between embracing it and viewing it as a threat, copy-cat altcoins trying to rob the clueless via pump and dump schemes, rogue developers trying to hijack the project to max out the block size and Wall St. holding back adoption by keeping ETF's in a perpetual bureaucratic limbo. 
So uh, don't buy more than you can afford to lose. For me I use 'the drywall test'. If losing my investment would require patching drywall in my living room, I need to sell a bit.

It's painful to read stuff like this. It's like some bizarre [Stockholm syndrome]( you're defending the people that are robbing you.
Imagine explaining this Johnny to the five year old. At the beginning of the year, his $10 can buy him $10 worth of candy. At the end of the year, that $10 can now buy $9.50 worth of candy. The five year old is going to ask 'Wait, where did my $0.50 go?'
The answer is quite simple: ['to the people that printed the new money']( Because clearly Johnny should have invested that $10 in stocks, bonds, commodities and other inflation-resistant assets.
Everything else, all the bullshit about markets, CPI, quantitative easing, interest rates, competitive devaluation, LIBOR etc etc is a shell game to keep money moving around in the system in a sufficiently complicated manner than when people ask questions there's lots of hand-waving and 'trust us, we're like, economists'.

I'd add that it will most likely be quite popular in countries that have experienced multiple bouts of currency mis-management and hyperinflation in the last century. Bitcoin's current volatility is nothing compared to three and four digit annual inflation rates in Brazil for instance. 
If it gains traction, stable countries would be the last to adopt Bitcoin - the Euro second to last and the US dollar last. In the mid-term, if the US bans it it will cause China-style capital flight as people with millions in Bitcoin simply move to a country that accepts it.

This is a pretty common misconception for mining. Miners are always going to be scraping by because it's a self-correcting system. As the price drops, miners that are no longer profitable stop mining. You figure if it's cheaper to just buy Bitcoins than mine, you'll just do that.  Likewise if you're buying instead of mining, the price slowly goes back up, finding an equilibrium there. It's actually pretty well balanced. 
Mining has slowly gravitated towards areas with extremely cheap/free or subsidized electricity. [The largest mine in China]( is working off hydroelectric. Also helpful is a really cold climate - you save on cooling costs.

This would entail the banks and the US admitting it's a threat to their monetary control instead of the current narrative being pushed by the media - i.e. 'a cute little interesting project thought up by Silicon Valley that doesn't really work' or 'an obscure, basically unused currency for dark net markets'. 
That would be the biggest BUY signal imaginable. Hell, just the nervousness and emotion this CEO showed when it was brought up tells volumes.

I agree completely, at least under the current climate and in the US. But we've started to get wind of crazier things on the horizon - negative interest rates for instance. That's a pretty insane 'fee' for safely storing money, as if inflation wasn't enough to worry about.

This is fine, the system is self-correcting. If miners drop out, the difficulty decreases, and mining becomes more profitable for those still mining. Mining is always going to be on the edge of profitability, and always going to favor those with some advantage (cheap or subsidized electricity, economies of scale/farms, etc).
Miners dropping out would not cause a backlog, or transactions to be mined faster or slower (after a [difficulty adjustment]( every 2016 blocks, or two weeks).

I think what people are saying is that decentralized, secure, trustless blockchains don't exist without miners. Miners don't mine out of the goodness of their hearts, they mine for rewards. If you want a huge number of miners securing your blockchain, the currency portion of your cryptocurrency requires a proportionally high value.
If you don't care about distributed security or think you can manage trust yourself, you don't need a blockchain - go create a centralized SQL database. 
If you do care about decentralization and security but think that the price of the coin isn't important? Go create an altcoin.

Bitcoin is an existential threat to debt. Originally the idea was shorter time frames to solve an immediate liquidity issue. 'I'll pay you for your labor after we harvest and sell these apples.' (Ignoring that you could have saved up to start your orchard in the first place.)
At some point that time horizon lengthened to 'I'll live like a king and pass on the cost to future generations., but it's ok because they can just do the same thing to their kids!  Fetch me my money press!' 
Right, because that doesn't sound too good to be true at all. Somewhere around debt levels of 200% GDP people start wondering about your ability to repay, and your country goes tits up. There are literally hundreds of historic examples of this.

Bitcoin is valuable *because* it's extremely hard to change. 
I frequently see variations of this argument on this sub. It's very easy in conversation to take 'stable, immutable, reliable' which are absolutely attributes you'd want in a new form of proto-money, and casually recontextualize it as 'stuck in the past, difficult to upgrade, uninteresting, not bleeding-edge, boring' which are absolutely *not* attributes you want in a run of the mill software project. 
The shorthand is often 'if Bitcoin can't keep up, the altcoins will cannibalize it'.  Which ignores that any innovation in an altcoin could be integrated back into Bitcoin if everyone wanted it as well. 
Bitcoin is not a software project, it's a completely new thing, and 'extremely difficult to change' a.k.a. 'decentralized', 'requires consensus' are positive attributes which were very carefully and deliberately baked into the structure from the beginning.

It's not about market size. Most people on this sub believe Bitcoin is worth far more because it's 'open' in every sense of the word: everyone can use it, innovate/build on it, it's trustless, inflation-proof, decentralized, permissionless and borderless. 
What the banks are creating will be the opposite of all those things: only banks can use it, they'll peg it to an existing fiat currency, which means it can be easily inflated, then add in the walled garden, some KYC laws, government oversight, gatekeepers, and you have yourself a nice little safe, crippled altcoin/settlement layer.

It's not, but I'll give you the public perception at the moment:

 - Various governments ban it. Banks laugh at it. Exchanges steal it from customers. Price climbs. Early adopters cash out, get rich. Exchange owner buys Cappuccinos, prostitutes, lavish lifestyle, goes to prison. 
 - (On the downside of a bubble crash, where we currently are) People that bought into the hype from the previous bubble are left holding the bag, get irritable. When they start asking questions about price movements, they get "well, uh, Bitcoin is capricious, we don't really know why the price moves, and uh... supply and demand. Yeah. Cough."
 - New awesome technology that solves scaling issues, makes the stock market fair, solves international remittances/property rights/etc always seem right around the corner.. 
 - *If* Bitcoin were to tank back to around zero, early adopters that made money would shrug it off as 'a cool experiment' while the bag holders would view it as a ponzi scheme. Telling them 'nah, it's more like a stock that crashes' probably wouldn't make them feel any better.

This is a pretty awkward comparison. Bitcoin is a currency, not a payment network.

You can use your credit card to *transact in* dollars, bolivar, or Bitcoin.

Again, I think you're forgetting that this currency is global. [Iceland, Bolivia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan and Vietnam]( have banned Bitcoin, while Russia and Thailand have banned and then waffled - all with little to no effect on the price, because Bitcoin owners in those countries can:
 
 - Buy/sell on another country's exchange and wire transfer back to themselves, or just leave that money in a foreign currency. 
 - Purchase items directly overseas and ship them home. Your government has no way of knowing if you purchased something with Bitcoin vs a credit card. 
There's no way for a government to limit the options you have to spend Bitcoins without banning the Internet. See also: TOR.

This is a loaded point of view here. 'Can't handle it' implies your own expectations. Quite a few of our developers are leaning towards Bitcoin as a settlement layer, with services built on top rather than thousands of nodes recording gigabytes of 'coffee shop transactions' into the blockchain forever. 
As much as I've tried, my girlfriend can't handle a dozen sessions of sex a day. That doesn't mean I need to train her up or switch to an altcoin. ;)

Thanks for the reply, it's appreciated. 
If I understand, you're painting a picture here of 'Bitcoin is artificially limited to 1MB blocks, another coin that doesn't have that limit will be at an advantage, and supplant it.' 
I realize it's a hotly contested topic, but from the development, analysis and data I've seen so far, I'd say 'blockchains don't scale well' due to the one-to many nature of distributed communication. The same reason a World of Warcraft server can't handle 100 on 100 battles: going from 99 to 100 players all having to communicate to each other multiple times a second is 100x the strain on the network. This is a fact not many in this community want to consider. Altcoins never gained enough popularity/scale to see if they could handle the higher bandwidth allowed, minus Ethereum, which has no limit, is getting fairly popular, but is already at a massive 80GB chain size, and growing alarmingly under its own weight. Their suggested solution to this problem is a switch to proof of stake from proof of work, which is untested (to say the least). 
Given that viewpoint, which I understand you probably disagree with, I think the only way forward is to use Bitcoin as a final settlement layer, and built services on top of it a'la Lightning Network or something similar. If no Lightning network or equivalent surfaces, we're in for a rocky ride - I don't think any POW blockchain can handle more than a few million users.

Dollars only if you're in the US. There are people trading BtC in  euros, or yuan, pounds sterling, Litecoins, Dodgecoins and hundreds of other currencies. Everything has a relative, fluctuating value to other currencies, commodities, stocks, gold, beanie babies and so on. 
Bitcoin is no different, and it is indeed 'money', with all the [properties of money]( a medium of exchange, a measure of value, a standard of debt, a store of value etc.

"When somebody wants to transact in the system, instead of you trying to acquire a bitcoin, you simply say, here are some U.S. dollars," the source said. "It's sort of a bitcoin but without the bitcoin."

'We really like this new 'car' technology, but the world is so used to horses. Can we have the horses pulling the car maybe, or stack the car on top of the horse?'
'I checked with engineering, they gave me a lot of pushback for some weird reason.'
'Hmm, is there some way to have horses driving the cars?' 
'Hey that's a good idea, I'll ask - ' 
'Great - while you're down there find out if there's a way to have a car engine power a horse's circulatory system.'

I agree with both sides here - Andreas is saying Bitcoin is vulnerable to social engineering.

I also agree with the people in this thread that are sick of what's now been years of waffling on the block size debate. Raise the stupid thing already - raise it some small amount like 4MB and gather some data about what was affected (if anything).

Ok, I understand the comparison to stock so Average Joe can compare Bitcoin to something familiar, but it's a bit off base. Commodities or gold are actually closer.
Imagine a stock where:
 - There's limited issuance, i.e. the company can't dilute existing shareholders by issuing more shares, or split the stock, or decide the company's growth has flatlined and switches to penny dividends.
 - The stock trades 24/7 instead of during business hours, preventing a privileged 'after hours' set of traders. (Who are able to sell based on that 8pm quarterly earnings report which tanks the stock 20% in the morning.) 
 - High-frequency trading and more importantly, front-running isn't possible. (EDIT: yes, that's possible on an exchange, just not on the blockchain.)
 - Settlement/ownership occurs in ~10 minutes instead of 3-4 business days.
 - Trading fees are $0.02 - $0.05 instead of $5-$10. 
 - It's just math, you don't need TDAmeritrade to 'handle things for you, for a small fee.' Nobody can freeze your account because there's no account, or social security number, or even an identity needed to move your money around, just an internet connection. A four year old, a computer AI, a dog, or a refrigerator can buy and sell at will. 
 - The company literally can't go out of business, or be sued, or miss an earnings estimate, or have a CEO quit, or a union strike, or be broken up as a monopoly. Nobody says 'Oh man, looks like gold missed their quarterly estimate, they'll probably go of business soon. Silver is going to eat their lunch.'
The FANG stocks above trade with ridiculous, unsustainable earnings multiples. Tesla, for instance, is trading at [125x future earnings]( With a market capitalization of $31 billion, Tesla is valued at about $620,000 for every car it delivered last year, and about $63,000 for every car it hopes to produce in four years, in 2020. 
Yet Bitcoin, which is on track to become the world's reserve currency, with a fixed supply, immune from government inflation, quantitative easing and the ability to effortless cross borders without being taxes, seized or skimmed, is considered 'too risky'? 
Man, I'm bullish. When people finally wrap their head around this it's going to be *nuts*. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 17:29:45




This isn't a fallacy at all. You've just described how all stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities work, i.e. supply and demand are king, sentiment and perception affect buyers and the market price *is* the reality. 
If people want Bitcoin for any one of its various use cases, the price rises, as it has for seven years (minus one). As the price rises, you add in speculators who are buying for that appreciation alone.

I envision a future reduction in the size of government. 
You've got it sort of backwards here - governments have gotten so big they now want Orwellian-level surveillance out of their populace, and the ability to levy federal/state income tax, sales tax, VAT, gas tax, capital gains tax, etc. The average American already pays [over 50%]( in taxes at the moment, and rising, and that doesn't count stealing stored wealth via 2-4% inflation a year. It's absurd. 
Without getting into a lengthy Keynesian vs Austrian debate, personally I believe that if Bitcoin can put an end that 2-4% inflation, quantitative easing, bank bailouts and the like, and instead encourage savings, the world will be vastly improved over the current crony capitalism that enables ridiculous wealth disparity.

I'm seeing this comparisons a lot lately. There is a big difference between a company like MySpace and a protocol. 
The protocol for email, SMTP has been around since the 60's - there were numerous attempts to improve on it that didn't catch on because it works 'good enough'. You could also look into IP4 vs IP6, no contest, IP6 is a massive improvement to the address space that rolled out in 1996, and we're still seeing mostly IP4 traffic. 
Companies like MySpace, Napster and Facebook and the like are built on top of Internet protocols, they come and go. Companies like Coinbase, Circle, MtGox, BTC-E, ChangeTip, Bitpay and the like are built on the Bitcoin protocol, and will likewise come and go.

I think on this sub, more people are worried about the existing government monopoly on *currency* more than corporate monopolies in various markets. Bitcoin was created as a reaction to  too-big-to-fail banks being given trillions by the government.

It's not a decision or ideological position on what Bitcoin is/could be, it's a statement about how the tech fundamentally works: a blockchain without a reward token is a slow, distributed database. We haven't seen any software, so there might be some advantages to that over SWIFT, then again, I don't expect your average banker to be able to parse how blockchains work. I wouldn't be surprised if they're be being pitched a super high-tech sounding (but useless) altcoin. 
All of the interesting parts of Bitcoin revolve around being trustless, distributed, deflationary, permissionless, not-debt based etc. ChaseCoin, JPMorganCoin and BOACoin will have none of those interesting bits. 
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:07:56
Gold has a lot more appeal because it's been around for thousands of years, Bitcoin is seven years old. I'd have a hard time convincing my parents or grandparents to own Bitcoin, they'd cite all the reasons you listed. But more tech-savy people that can parse Bitcoin's strengths over gold might prefer it.
 - With any large amount of gold, you now have to pay people to store it for you, or pay to turn your house into a fortress. Bitcoin is free to store for any amount, and (arguably) harder to steal. 
 - I can cross political borders with any amount of Bitcoin without worrying about it being seized, stolen or taxed.

The same reason venture capitalists have a hard time pitching Bitcoin to investors, but everyone perks up when you mention 'Blockchain technology': branding.
Various media outlets have spent about two years associating Bitcoin with illegal activity: Silk Road, drug dealing, contract killing, money laundering, shady exchanges stealing customer funds and so on... and now they want back in and can't easily undo that perception. So they've decided to rebrand the term so they can be associated with it again. 
At least I hope that's the issue. The alternative - that clever salesmen are fleecing clueless banks of millions of dollars for incomplete tech that will 'usher them back into tech relevance' - is much worse.

Next up, price. 4chan used to tip people 5-10 BtC for image requests, $0.50 at the time, now thousands. It is not a stretch to imagine Bitcoin's price spiking again, it has four times already. Your hundred in tips could be 5 or 10x that in a few years.

You're both correct. Precious metals have been used worldwide as a store of value for thousands of years. Coins as we know them date back to the Greeks around [700BC]( It took a long time - multiple generations, to convince people that fiat currencies had value even if they're no longer made of precious metals. 
It will take a long time for Bitcoin too I'd imagine. 
What ztsmart is alluding too is that once free of the ties to metals, a government can inflate their currency until their hearts content (or until hyperinflation). At least being 'backed by gold' placed some restriction on governments just springing money into existence, essentially robbing future generations of their productivity and saddling them with debt.

 - Act like a technophobe. Tell him you're confused about how to send your info for verification and could really use easy-to-understand step-by-step instructions. Ask for URLs that you should be using. Tell him you could really use the money, and is it possible to get a bonus if you refer other people to him?
 - Tell him you use Breadwallet now, but still have an old Blockchain wallet, but would Breadwallet work?
 - Send slightly wrong information, resend slightly different wrong information. Send an empty wallet, or two. 
 - Ah crap, you forgot that there's only $0.83 in this wallet, you'll need to buy more coins from Coinbase to load up that wallet again, which takes two days to clear, you'll have to get back to him. 
And so on.

[Iceland]( tipped over and had a banking collapse in 2008 just as it crossed that mark. 
"In 2007 Iceland's three main banks made loans equivalent to about nine times the size of the booming economy, up from about 200% of GDP after privatization in 2003."
[Japan]( managed to regulate itself over to the deflation end of the scale, opting for a 20 year depression... which honestly isn't really all that much better than hyperinflation.

This is dangerous thinking. Bitcoin is the test - the flagship product.  If it crashes, a few hundred thousand people are out thousands of dollars. They're not going to go 'Oh well, guess I'll get a few grand of Litecoin next!' They'll start telling friends and family crypto is a scam. Banks, big media and governments go 'we told you so!' and over regulate, and a tiny fraction of people would ever consider investing again. The remaining altcoins would have barely any market cap and insane volatility - with everyone trying to get out first at the least hint of a crash. 
It would set crypto back years, we have to avoid it.

Personally, that's a non-starter for me. And that's even before you get into the bigger issue of 'if a cryptocurrency's price/value comes from it being a 'store of value', but a fancier altcoin can come along and replace it every few years... well cryptocurrencies aren't a store of value then.' 
I'm not saying you can't make money. Obviously you can if people are buying, driving the price up, just do some research - know what you're buying and why.

Ok, heated topic, and I'm speaking for nobody but myself having followed this for months. For me personally, it's because Satoshi coded a 32MB limit, and later added the 1MB cap as a quick-fix for spam.

Yes, I realize the counter argument du jour here is 'Satoshi isn't perfect!' Or something, but still. So many systems, game theory and checks and balances work out so elegantly in Bitcoin, I think this was a shoot from the hip decision she thought could be easily lifted later.

Of course not, there's been dozens of altcoins. To be fair, none of them have approached even 1% of Bitcoin's userbase/hashing power/security, but that's not to say it's impossible. 
I think most people here agree that if the banks can use some sort of premined altcoin to improve on legacy systems, cool, more power to them.

This was exactly the conversation I had with a coworker that convinced me to buy my first coins at $80/each. She said "imagine a stock where"
 - There's limited issuance, i.e. the company can't dilute existing shareholders by issuing more shares, or split the stock, or decide the company's growth has flatlined and switch to penny dividends.
 - The stock trades 24/7 instead of during business hours, preventing a privileged 'after hours' set of traders. (Who are able to sell based on that 8pm quarterly earnings report which tanks the stock 20% in the morning.)
 - High-frequency trading and more importantly, front-running isn't possible (or possible on an exchange, just not on the blockchain.)
 - Settlement/ownership occurs in ~10 minutes instead of 3-4 business days.
 - Trading fees are $0.10 instead of $5-$10.
 - It's just math, you don't need TDAmeritrade to 'handle things for you, for a small fee.' Nobody can freeze your account because there's no account, or social security number, or even an identity needed to move your money around, just an internet connection. A four year old, a computer AI, a dog or a refrigerator can buy and sell at will.
 - The company literally can't go out of business, or be sued, or miss an earnings estimate, or have a CEO quit, or a union strike, or be broken up as a monopoly. Nobody says 'Oh man, looks like gold missed their quarterly estimate, they'll probably go of business soon. Silver is going to eat their lunch.'
 - FANG stocks trade with ridiculous, unsustainable earnings multiples. Tesla, for instance, is trading at 125x future earnings. With a market capitalization of $31 billion, Tesla is valued at about $620,000 for every car it delivered last year, and about $63,000 for every car it hopes to produce in four years, in 2020.
Yet Bitcoin, which is on track to become the world's reserve currency, with a fixed supply, immune from government inflation, quantitative easing and the ability to effortless cross borders without being taxes, seized or skimmed, is considered 'too risky' by many? Once enough people wrap their head around the tech, it's just plain going to skyrocket.

I've explained it many times to people, and when it goes awry, reactions fall into three buckets:
1) **They don't understand what money is/how it works.** I once explained inflation to someone - 'Whoa, you don't have a 401k, do you realize that if you just keep cash in a bank, you're slowly losing money?' They looked at me like I'm insane, and I had to go 'Ok, when I was in elementary school, chocolate milk was $0.35. Now it's a dollar. Why the difference?' 
If you're starting there, you can stop. That person isn't going to understand currency vs gold vs stocks, inflation, markets, let alone Bitcoin. That's hours of explaining how the world works just to get to Bitcoin - nobody has the interest or patience for a six hour lecture on economics. 
2) **They don't understand the tech.** Everything in software can be copied. Your cat photos live on your iPhone, your iMac, the Mac's external Time Machine backup, iCloud, Dropbox, in gMail attachments... the idea of a piece of data that can't be copied is *not* intuitive. 
If they're tech savvy, you can spend 10-15 minutes explaining basic cryptography, mining, blockchains and so on, and if you do a good job, they'll get it. If you're getting questions like 'What about software bugs?' 'What if it's hacked?' and 'Can I mine for them?' you're on the right track. If they're glazing over, it's too much in one go or you're explaining it poorly. Then they walk away thinking it's basically World of Warcraft gold (which I did too at one point). 
3) **They think the government will stomp it into oblivion any second now.** These guys have a solid grasp of everything so far, also know the government has an absolute stranglehold on fiat, and refuse to think there's any way around that. The government is an omnipotent shadow society of guys with guns and black vans that you absolutely do not screw with, and they *hate* Bitcoin. 
With these guys, you need to explain that Bitcoin isn't illegal, we have legit exchanges like Coinbase and it isn't just in the US, it's in every country. It *could* be outlawed, but then again, so was BitTorrent and music/movie sharing, and that isn't going so well either. 
With these guys you're generally fighting public perception. Remember the media spent about two years associating Bitcoin with the 'deep web', dark net markets, drugs, contract killing and so on.

Sort of along the lines of stock, but a stock is tied to the fundamentals of a company - as the company grows, the stock is generally a multiplier of assets, profit, times a multiplier (usually based on the industry, 2x to say 30x+ for small companies with a lot of potential upside). We see swings due to quarterly earning reports, product issues, new research and development, growth, management shake-ups and other issues that could affect profitability. 
Bitcoin is not tied to anything. It (arguably) has value due to scarcity (21 million coins), and utility/usefulness - being able to instantly transport it for extremely small fees. Oversimplified, like anything, it has value if people think it does. There is a chance it could collapse due to software glitches, government regulation, large-scale exchange hacking/theft, or on the upside become a default currency for the internet, or even potentially compete with or replace fiat currencies. Nobody knows, so we see large fluctuations based on rumor, news, government/local regulation, adoption by large companies, alignment of the stars, phases of the moon, manipulation by the hollow Earth people, etc.

Or you can Google ‘Elliot Wave Supercycles’ if you’re a technical analysis type.

You're still assuming people will *always* eventually want to convert back to fiat - once you have Bitcoins, even if it's blocked/banned/outlawed or exchanges are shut down, you can still purchase things directly with it.

Ha, so much gloom and doom here. From a miner's perspective, a halving is no different from a doubling in difficulty (it halves their income), which happens multiple times a year. According to the charts, already [twice this year]( which is about half over.

The concept is similar to precious metals. 
If I have stacks of gold coins in a vault behind a painting, they're 'mine'. I 'own' them in the physical sense. If I have a contract from a company saying I own a stack of gold coins in *their* vault, that's not the same. That's an IOU, a promise from the company that they'll give me my coins - they may not (they may not even own them themselves). 
Bitcoins are entries on a global, distributed ledger (spreadsheet). I can 'spend' them with a private key which is on a [paper, software or hardware wallet]( (the equivalent of the vault). If someone else has that key, I don't have Bitcoins, I have IOUs for Bitcoins. I'm at the mercy of Coinbase or Circle to give me my coins when I ask for them.

I can't speak for everyone, but the people I know who have Bitcoin are speculating on it as a digital form of gold. They also like the bearer bond nature of it - that it can't be seized, taxed or stolen, and that you can transfer it to anyone without permission. They're mostly geeks playing around with new tech. 
Could the price crash again? Of course, it has four times already, hence speculation.

And this here folks, is why you invest your money in Bitcoin instead of centralized altcoins. Bitcoin is far too large and distributed to be 'hijacked' by some rogue developer group, and, even assuming you plea to the judicial system for some sort of punitive/injunctive relief, too large for a court or government to alter or tamper with it.

The upside to the crypto world is unstable, inflationary fiat money being replaced with mathematically-provable sound money, and the removal of a 'money cartel' that can print fiat at whim, enriching themselves at the cost of your purchasing power and life savings.
That's a *massive* sweeping reform which will clean out the middlemen, optimizing nearly everything that touches money, freeing up billions, if not trillions. You literally can't have the US military go 'oops, we don't know where [$2.8 trillion went]( in a world where all transactions are public on a blockchain. 
I appreciate the reply, and can understand where you're coming from, but you're still thinking pre-Internet and pre-crypto. All of the minor issues you discussed will be slowly sorted out.

Reddit similarly has its own... quirks that can be exploited. 
Anyone that hangs out here long enough starts to see the pattern in the comments
 - Perfectly reasonable, informative posts go from 5 to -5 in the span of a few minutes
 - The same leading questions being asked by one-month old accounts: When Bitcoin forks, can I spend on both chains? If four miners own 70% of the hashrate, how can Bitcoin be decentralized? Oh noes I 'forgot' a fee, is my money lost!? Can the Chinese firewall break Bitcoin? What happens when quantum computers break SHA-256? What happens when Bitcoin is full and everyone switches to (altcoin) and the price skyrockets and because I got in early I get rich and buy an island in the Caribbean?
 - Repeated character assassination attempts
 - Refusal to agree on approaches, nitpicking proposals without suggesting solutions, timelines are always too fast or slow, inability to even agree on terms like 'spam' 'full' 'centralized' and the like. If someone suggests the devs are steering the ship, sidetrack the conversation by saying nodes or miners should be
 - Sockpuppets talking to themselves using the same word choice, grammar, tone, punctuation, ignoring people who answer their questions and instead steering the conversation towards specific talking points
 - Generalized FUD: Craig is Satoshi! We should do what he says! Blockstream bought up the blockchain so they can make bank with the Lightning Network! SegWit is too complicated and probably buggy even though it works fine on Litecoin! If we don't immediately fork to SegWit2x then everything will come crashing down and everyone will move to (altcoin I bought a crapton of last week)!

Unlikely, why flat-out seize people's life savings when you can just debase the existing currency?
If governments created some law allowing them to straight-up seize people's life savings, there would be all-out rioting, requiring militarized police to contain things, people would stop working, flee the country, start hiding wealth wherever and however they could (art, precious metals, Bitcoin, collectibles, bearer bonds, Amazon gift cards etc). 
However, it seems if you [print money]( even at some insane rate like [$90 billion a month]( for a few years, creating asset bubbles and rapidly devaluing everyone's savings, well Average Joe doesn't really seem to notice that. It takes years for that to filter down and say, double the cost of your rent, health insurance and groceries in 4-5 years. 
The amusing part (as always) is that money printing doesn't help, it actually exacerbates the issues and [increases wealth disparity]( Japan led the charge here, buying over [$3 trillion]( in bonds in a desperate attempt to end decades of stagflation, with the end result being twenty years of deflation *and* the country struggling like mad recently to even get to a 1% interest rate and get markets chugging along again.

Sure, I agree with this. People will still need credit, car loans and mortgages, and there will probably be a crypto equivalent of a credit card unless a distributed equivalent becomes common (an open-source LendingClub would be pretty cool). 
What crypto will do, and is doing, is open money up to everyone, eliminating the entire class of rent-seeking middlemen who nickel and dime you to death just moving ones and zeros around, i.e. what the Internet does, removing the banking equivalent of AOL Online trying to charge you $9/month for Internet and an email address.
Things that are going away: remittance-based businesses like [Western Union]( monthly/maintenance fees that charge you $10 for not having $1,000 a.k.a. 'minimum balance charges', ATM fees, overdraft fees, returned check fees, foreign transaction charges, lost card fees, inactivity/account closing fees, etc etc. 
Lastly, at the highest level, central banks are going to have an interesting dilemma. Wealth inequality has [already been linked to excessive money printing]( When that's common knowledge, there *will* be public backlash, and people are going to have the choice between holding their hard-earned wealth in a fixed-supply currency, or an [ever-deflating]( fiat currency. It's no contest.

If you're envisioning Tom Cruise hacking into a computer like in Mission Impossible, you're not being creative enough. Much more likely scenarios include:

 - Incompetence/negligence, software is made by humans. Do a little light reading on [Mt Gox]( For the people going 'I'd just sue Coinbase if they lose my money', it's been what, four years since Mt Gox exploded, and people will likely get pennies on the dollar after the lawyers take their share. 
 - The US government decides Bitcoin is a threat to the dollar, and 'socializes' Coinbase in the interest of national security.

What they're not thinking of is why anyone would use FedCoin over Bitcoin, which would be global, have a fixed release rate, total coin cap and market size in the hundreds of billions at that point. If pressed, I'd guess the answer would be some variation on 'oh, we'll just make them use it!'

A financial Wild West is awesome until you get shot. 
Now I'm seeing the same thing with the codebase. The concepts, incentives, game theory, economics and code itself are so complicated 99% of people can't understand them and rely on other people's simplifications/interpretations. All someone had to do was cast the competency of the developers in doubt, come up with a semi-plausible new direction, repeat ad nauseum, astroturf, and Bitcoin grinds to a halt. We can't move forward unless a critical mass agrees on a direction, and per this pie chart we're basically split evenly across four incompatible directions, with smooth-talking evangelists, politicians, drum-beating zealots and philosophizing armchair engineers on every side. 
I can almost visualize the greedy bankers breathing a collective sigh of relief. I don't know, it's an ideological mess really. Freedom I guess means freedom to make stupid choices too. 
I'll buy some Bitcoin 2.0 if the core devs design it. I'm sure they have some interesting ideas if they could start over from scratch.
