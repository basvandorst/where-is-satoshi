OK so they could limit large ingress and egress out of exchanges. 
Limit real estate transactions on this administrative technicality, block legality of recorded transactions. Ok. 
Prosecute transactions made in person using undercover agents. 
And surely there are other high-dollar scenarios. 
But if I like go buy a used car and pay in crypto, how the fuck are they gonna stop that? Patrolling undercover car buyers?
And how long til the non-terrorist, non-money laundering, beleaguered, irritated populace says “enough”?
If someone wants to transfer money overseas, how the fuck are they gonna stop that?
Later once the stuff gains critical mass it becomes fully fungible with the addition of some code, decentralized exchanges happen, etc.

That's the problem. Tax cuts for corporations do work, but then the corporations don't turn around and take care of their people. And there are iterations of this the other way around in engineered systems.
All you have to do is read a history book and then look around you to know that capitalism has produced the highest standard of living in human history, and yet what it now needs is abdication of  racism and the acceptability of unfettered greed. In other words, further stages of human inner growth.

Last year it was 15-17 pesos to the dollar. Now it’s approaching 40. The prior year it had been like 10-11. 
 A lot of people seem very in-the-moment, and approach facts emotionally. Macri is the devil because my sueldo (salary) is worth less, but when the government was printing pesos, my life seemed OK I was paying less for electricity and gas, and dollars were cheaper, so that system is good. 
 Never mind it was all being bought on credit cards, the bills for which were about to be ignored. Eventually the credit card gets shut off.

@_date: 2018-09-25 02:20:01
There is not any huge dialogue about bitcoin in Argentina right now because the pain level on the street is not high enough, people are hurting bad but not completely panicking. 
People suffer percentage buying power losses quietly or buy dollars — by way of this, those who do will be OK. 
To be honest, I think it would take lack of ability to buy/acquire dollars to really make this happen. Or for the on the street exchange rate for dollars to skyrocket. That would shift the dialogue.
Further, Macri could still always pull off a victory and stabilize the economy and lower the exchange rate. 
But, if the news eventually ends up being horrific, which is well possible, I think this place would be ripe for it.
I don’t know where this article is getting its information, I don’t see this necessarily on the street, but the perfect storm for adoption in Argentina would be the following:
Inflation shoots up again significantly
The government or other factors somehow restrict the ability to buy dollars
Bitcoin price remains stable
...And then of course what would really speed adoption is bitcoin price rises, perhaps at least as much as the peso falls. You would see a bum rush into it I reckon, which if a big Argentine buy-in occurs may be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:40:23
To me it’s people throwing a fit in the streets when Macri tries to be responsible, because they are going to have to pay five dollars more for electric this month or 30 cents more on the subway. They don’t want any part of their lives inconvenienced in any way. Never mind that their whole system and it’s currency is on shaky ground. They don’t seem to understand the gravity of it all. 
 But then again Argentina has always been about sucking up whenever possible from the land, without any real investment in any kind of future.

So, I think they are doing us a huge favor. This is a juggernaut that, practically speaking, they can only slow. 
Their ONLY way to stop it is make it irrelevant by massive reform of the monetary supplies and systems such as some kind of return to responsible gold-standard-like backing of currency — which, come on, we know will never happen.

No one is directly answering this. Basically, when someone wants to buy, the market software sets the current price shown to them a touch higher. At the same time, someone is selling and it sets the price given to them a touch lower. 
Therefore, if there is an equal amount of product offered and bought, the price will hover in place, roughly balanced out. If one outpaces the  other, the price will rise (more buying) or drop (more selling) respectively via this incremental increase or decrease mechanism. In stock markets, used to be by hand by for quite a long while but for a long time now has been done via software. Crypto markets have obviously always been run on software. 
But basically the same principles are in play in crypto markets as with stocks and crashing currencies. Kind of an entropy/momentum/weight type concept.

Yes, zero say. You can buy one coin from a guy in person for $1 (possible) or from an ATM at 25% above a certain market's price (common). 
Same thing with stocks or goats or vacation tours. 
But basically the markets work like a joust, kind of: tempt me to sell mine at $3999...I attack. Tempt another to buy at $4001...he does not attack. Price in that marketplace is $3999. 
They both attack, its roughly $4000. 
Only the buyer attacks ($3999 was too low to tempt seller to attack) process $4001. And the joust tempts start again until players attack or leave the arena. And prices shift accordingly based on type of action more frequently requested/desired. 
Then, arena to arena (different marketplaces) action and therefore prices will be different, where you can buy in one marketplace and sell in another at a profit  This further promotes acting in a given arena to make profits that way. Etc.

If sellers can buy necessities / pay rent here with the pesos now, they will. 
I think the problem that will stop mass adoption is safe storage. Things get imported here and are double the price, and the people make half the salary or less. A $50 cold storage key is $100 when it gets here and most people I don’t think have home computers. It’s smartphones they do have. 
If there was a device:
Made in Argentina (so it’s cheap)
Simple to use as whatsapp 
Separate from your steal-able phone (keep some funds in hot lightning wallet, rest locked up at home)
That could plug directly into an android phone to add or remove/store funds 
Btc has the best chance of taking off here. 
I think phone-only software wallets with the phone thefts here and so on will chill adoption. 
If someone figures this out, it will tee up the first big real historical shot at mass adoption. The people are smart but lack the resources above.

Yeah this is the Spook Show, I am convinced: 
Some whale or whales dump to spook everyone, reliably shaking out weak, greedy, scared hands — rebuying again in a week or two with the price in the depressed pits. Wash, rinse, repeat and - with such discipline - massively profit with zero additional investment. 
It’s a game of the very bold to fleece the very weak.

Rich people will store coin on their expensive (for here) imported cold storage devices and small amounts could be put on smartphones that are common but vulnerable to being stolen. 
But until either balances on stolen phone wallets can be immediately locked and assured AND this is as easy a whatsapp automated backup and no more complex...
...or there is a very cheap, very safe cold storage device that will plug directly into an android phone to add or offload funds for safe storage...the absolute ideal... 
Bitcoin will not take off widely in Argentina. 
Only rich people will use it as store of value. 
This is marginally ok...but not the absolutely amazing thing it could be if one or both of the above conditions were fulfilled. 
One or both would set the stage for mass adoption and widespread, common use.
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:39:25

No, they are one brilliant chess move ahead — they post this stuff knowing they will look like weak, greedy, get-rich-quick plebes, which scares away any speculative sentiment in the at-least-mildly-educated masses. 
This then delivers long-term sideways motion, which then looks like stability to the same reasonable, respectable, investment-interested group, who then gradually, responsibly pile in. 
The change to slower headwinds avoids dramatics dips and spikes in favor of eventual long term steady rise. Same ultimate amounts, but greatly reduced volatility with less trauma and large numbers are delivered net sooner. 
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:51:07
Ok so I think this would also work:
Opendime-type devices made Argentina (to avoid price-doubling import taxes and make them as cheap as possible). Or Chinese but who trusts the those fuckers. 
Hideable on ones person. 
The taller order(s):
Can plug into phone directly and add and offload funds. Process must be super straightforward and easy. 
Use phone as low-balance hot wallet. 
That would work, I believe: leave major balance on storage opendime at home, hide moderate balances on another maybe connected by tether in riñonera (hidden pouch belt Fanny pack thingies), hot wallet on phone. I’d do that!
So, if phone is stolen - no pasa nada - no big deal - moderate storage was in hidden waist pocket and full account is at home.
Have a hole for a tether on device to allow for on-person carry securely. 
Wow! That would be exciting. There is a good chance the ground is fertile for this here. Elections will bring a freewheeling populist, probably irresponsible government and the peso may well continue to plummet, driving adoption. 
Someone would do well as first mover and prove safety with constant independent checks.

The (thankful) truth is that the hidden purpose of their existence is to provide liquidity to this market now. It encourages new entrants when they can easily exit, like easy returns at a retail establishment. The greed will ultimately be looked back upon as having generously greased the wheels of adoption. 
I think the system, whether designed knowingly or not, is an inspired rechanneling of human nature and thusly accounts for all comers, including these avaricious liquidity providers.
Plus, look at the patterns now: they shoot up, then quickly shoot down. The ranges are getting relatively tiny. Overall, stability is coming, brought on by greedy + fearful bots.

Until it’s solved I’m calling that bitcoin never gets mass adoption in this country. Only amongst the wealthy with disposable income to sock away as well as to buy hardware wallets in the first place. 
Well — or invent some very cheap LN keychain dumb device that can send and receive but that keeps accounts 100% recoverable in case of theft and non-usable to the thief. 
If such a device was say $25 or less and easy enough for grandma to use and there were point of sale payment processing units available — yes, it would take off this way alternately. 
If people could go to an atm or use localbc and load it, see their balance on a screen or mirror on smartphone, never lose the funds in case of theft or loss and spend with it with compatible point of sale devices, it could easily take off here. 
It’s different than the first world. Many things are much harder here - acquisition, wealth building, life in general. The vast majority are not so free financially and are scraping by.
If someone figures this out, it’s chances of mass-adoption increase dramatically and I mean dramatically. 
So — great mobile software or great clever cheap devices with payment processing hardware ecosystem.

I’ve been here a while. This is what will have to happen:
Funds will not be kept on computers — too many don’t have. Will largely be a cell phone wallet-only culture. 
A mobile wallet app that in the case of phone theft doesn’t matter — the person keeps their funds no matter what. Will not be adopted otherwise. Phone theft common and would be worse with the temptation of stealing valuable funds. 
App must be as easy to use as Whatsapp, if not easier. Most are not super tech savvy, especially the mature folks. Like anywhere. 
Hardware wallets will largely not be used. The vast majority cannot spare the $50 for a hardware wallet — which with government import taxes as they are, will double to $100+ and could easily be barred from import if the government feels its a threat. It’s the Wild West a bit here with reality distortion, subtly bent rights and corruption. A good solution needs to be created, as above. 
Documentation / website / YouTube videos of all of this in ELI5 Spanish with clear instructions and practices laid out. 
If all of the above can be 100% accounted for, it has a chance of being the first country where it takes off — everything is as primed as it gets right now: still some wealth to put somewhere, but potentially very near a cliffs edge. 
But if only 99% of the above is cared for, it will not at all. Especially the mobile wallet-only funds security in the case of theft, key loss, new phone, etc.
@_date: 2019-06-30 07:01:12

Circumstance is on our side. Maybe governments and world politics suddenly go full humanistic and suddenly began to serve us benignly from top to bottom. But what are the real chances? 
They are already tipping their cards, like American officials saying “Libra is a threat to national sovereignty” — if that’s the case, then Bitcoin is an existential threat. 
But the truth is that they are saying it’s a threat to their ability to control money, markets and people, to print money to prosecute lucrative wars, etc. It’s an existential threat to out-of-control governance, nothing more. 
Then I firmly believe we will eventually be voting  issue by issue using open source blockchain, and political parties with their bundled policies will be unbundled and fallible humans prone to corruption will be made obsolete in governance. 
There will be overseers — like your county property tax collector: administrates, oversees. maybe lightly advocates without authority, but really is just counting up and monitoring pre-determined numbers, payments and that the resources are being allocated per winning plans. With his or her results shown on blockchain as well. A full circle of transparent, mathematical oversight.

Yes, someone or some group in the first world gives away a bunch of bitcoin but it tips the first domino.

That it dilutes is a misreading. 
It creates money based on promises to pay — to work or somehow otherwise deliver something the real world values enough to pay for. 
And as long as everyone keeps their promises, the system functions. Instead of the gold standard it is the promise-of-delivered-value standard. 
The trouble is it can be risky and when enough don’t or can’t keep their promises, it fails. 
But it is not diluting anything.

One, yes, two, who knows, three, really who knows. 
Leveraging like this caused 2007/8 but one level is empirically a far lower risk of catastrophic promise-breaking/default. 
So, how much can we get away with, in a scientific, useful-regularity sense? They still don’t know because it’s either way underused (strict gold standard) or quickly overused (fiat untethering).

You’re describing it like it’s some great Ponzi scheme, but it’s not because people earn money (produce something for which someone pays them to receive) and pay debts back all the time. 
It’s the rule not the exception, unless the practice of lending would end. And it hasn’t — because they do fulfill their promises. 
So lending and money printing continues, and, well-regulated, things work.
Overleverage is what causes 2007’s by amplifying sensitivity to temporary economic challenges. Lack of regulation of leverage. There is a reasonable sweet spot in the middle.

It doesn’t dilute anything if it’s backed. In this case, it’s backed by promises, which, if made good, makes it practically as good as gold.
@_date: 2019-04-29 13:47:45
Almost all commentators here have a fundamental misunderstanding. Or missing piece.
Yes they don’t have the reserves. It’s like how the Federal Reserve doesn’t have gold. 
What they do have “of value” is the promise to pay, which is either from work or some other form generating value, from the borrower. If the borrower keeps this, it is this valuable, just like gold is valuable, and thus is it as good as gold.
This is why civilization hasn’t collapsed after leaving the gold standard: the borrowers promise and they later make good. It works. 
We put ourselves at risk that it will fail, promises not kept, value not delivered, and thus all of us here reckon it’s not ideal (myself included), but functionally, in general, it can function.
@_date: 2019-04-30 16:55:02
You’re describing one aspect of the economy. There are people that grow tomatoes and sell them. Different ways to do the same thing. Not everything is endless fractal-style leveraging of paper.

It will still work for me, started early last year. And in x years after, it will still work for those who bought in at 8k, etc. Some get in high in a cycle, some low. Up down up down...but always manages to wander UP, and for nearly a decade.  
I mean, you have your opinion, I have mine...and maybe you're the smarter one, who knows...but if you can't see that this is going to be absolutely huge (or replaced by something similar that becomes absolutely huge), my opinion is that is a huge failure of imagination and my opinion is you are going to sorely, sorely miss out. But to each his own opinion.

No laws against it. No enforcement of anything in any way. Most people can’t buy 10k a month anyhow, even those considered richer in the “rich” city, Bs As. 
This restriction was designed to stop capital bleed-out in the business sector. Still bullshit in first-world terms,  but this is not the first world.
In the argenbitcoin sub, there is acknowledgement of technological illiteracy. The culture is such that if the pain or motivation is enough and dollars become less available on the street, people will learn and switch. Dollars could get bought up, get clamped down for smaller amounts that do affect the people, etc. Not before.
That said, it’s well possible this happens in the next couple of years. 
Lightning network will help adoption. $90 or even $60 to begin with hardware wallet, a price already hard to swallow here, marked up double due to import taxes will be tough to swallow. Crypto I’d bet will be largely kept on phones — so their security, reliability and recoverability will be key. Dudes on motorbikes snatch phones from hands in the street all the time, must be accounted for. If it’s as easy and standard as whatsapp, it would catch on. 
Visibility-wise, I’ve seen bitcoin buying sites advertised on the subway. It’s not that some are not trying. It’s just going to take worse dollar-peso sliding *and* unavailability of dollars to motivate the population to learn. For now, those with extra to save will buy dollars.

You sell house bitcoin that they loan you. Later, you return the bitcoin to the house at the current market price. 
So -- you sell the loaned bitcoin, they drop, sell them back to the house at the new lower price, you keep the difference.
But if you sell and the stocks go up, you sell them back to the house at current higher market and lose money. 
Either way, you're on the hook. 
That's how it works.

They are tipping their hands. They cannot stop bitcoin — hence the silence. They can stop centralized Libra, hence the swift action. But they are utterly tipping their hand. 
The minute the majority decide, however good or bad they might think government is or isn’t, that they nevertheless don’t mind government not having control of printing presses and banks no longer having agency to charge crippling overdraft fees and the various other ways they treat people poorly any longer, that will be that.

Whales are so fucking dumb. They’ll keep doing this, and getting soaked up a little bit more each time. Eventually they’ll run out of whale meat. 
The more the value of the asset is realized worldwide by more people, the more the dip will be bought, and each time we buy the dip we loosen that much more whale grip. 
It’s going to increasingly be a dangerous game for them to play as purchase-redistribution slowly eats them alive, they’ll be stuck with ever more fiat. 
Always wait — always buy the dip, because each time we are disciplined awaiting times like this, it erodes the big stores of coins that can unilaterally do this.
@_date: 2019-09-05 13:33:41

I'm becoming more and more convinced the daily masturbation over price is a very short term thing for the greediest. It's a game the vast majority will never win.
The people who win long term (in both holdings and mental health) are intuitive holders (yes, I refuse to misspell it), meaning those who can smell what's cooking in the distance: governments all around the world up to their usual, probably only marginally deterred by something that will majorly disrupt their money-printing capabilities.
Something that they won't be able to stop. Something that will bring stability to the unstable, accountability without any concentration of power and transparency where there was only varying degrees of human energy-sapping obfuscation.
And once one currency falls to it, other dissatisfied populations will see what's possible and understand.  All it will take is for grocers, landlords and gas stations to take btc and for bosses to give the option to take pay in it, and we are off to the races, no fiat conversion, and the most friction-free, lossless commerce ever known to man.
Banks will gradually close or be wildly diminished and the "energy consumption" of bitcoin will look like a bargain. 
Widespread adoption will drain whales and leave them stuck with ever greater amounts of fiat, and ever shrinking amounts of btc as their game gets wrecked, and with such distribution, prices will normalize and steady.
I am only just now grasping the implications, worth and utility of the Lightning Network, etc. It is truly, truly fascinating.
And ultimately anyone with decent balances won't be immune from taking the temptation of swapping holdings for property, lifestyle, etc. and the wealth will thus distribute itself.
It's all brilliantly engineered to mesh with human psychology and bring sovereignty, safety and their personal benefits to all people. Truly a huge gain for humanity.

Speculative right now amongst nerds that get it. 
If price/adoption/use cases go up, it will be bought in small amounts widely, massively re-valued (upward) but also massively stabilized. 
Next, through the smashing of sell walls and the like by organic demand, the coin reserves of the mass-manipulating whales will be drained, further stabilizing it.

The way he trumpets freedom via thematic liaisons with money laundering — decidedly not smart. The non-funny, not-really-even-wry garden-path nerd humor leaks badly and deflates with a whimper.
