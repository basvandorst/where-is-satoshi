Then what exchange you talking about?
@_date: 2018-09-25 11:09:13
Big if true
@_date: 2018-09-29 14:07:13
Very good question. Adoption comes from usecases. Usecases can be anything from store-of-wealth to daily purchases, the more we use it the higher the adoption will be.
@_date: 2018-09-13 20:42:26
You are correct 
@_date: 2018-09-12 12:17:32
Walmart is selling chocolate which named “bitcoin” for 1$

I like anarchy

So, Coinbase... but with your own wallet... I am not too sure that banks would want to do that, I bet they’ll be pushing to control your wallets, like Revolut does now
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:31:14
I prefer send 0.015 BTC and you send me 15 BTC back, will that work for you?
@_date: 2018-09-15 09:51:15
Do you have your written analysis somewhere?
@_date: 2018-09-13 10:29:46
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:13:57
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. It’s always better to hedge your risk, if loosing 20k won’t make you go crazy - then it’s ok to take the hit. You’ll be laughing once/if BTC goes to $20k
@_date: 2018-09-10 11:22:59
TL;DR critique might be:
- 21m can
- Deflation
- Dev. incentives: ICOs
- Energy waste
- Small blocks: scaling issues
- Volatile
- No Turing (completeness)
- High fees
- Selfish mining
- No KYC
- Toxic fans

Bitcoin exchange? All you need is a wallet to store your bitcoins in, unless you talking about actual trading
@_date: 2018-09-29 16:32:04
Looks like some need to learn how to photoshop better
@_date: 2018-09-19 05:54:12
Go with classic “Hodl”
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:30:23
How did you calculate this?
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:20:47
DJ KHALID
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:16:39
How about $1000000 double spent?
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:47:11
I was only highlighting the scam above
@_date: 2018-09-12 19:49:44
How would you feel if you loose that 20k?
@_date: 2018-09-19 05:57:25
BTC -&gt; exchange -&gt; USD -&gt; your bank -&gt; his bank
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:39:40
I have, was just curious about what math exactly you talking about
@_date: 2018-09-12 08:55:48
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:34:37
Ah typical Michael and his trying to get rich quick scheme
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:27:41
LTC, dodge, etc all similar to BTC as in they are opened source ones and unowned as such...
@_date: 2018-09-12 09:23:07
Using that analogy, why would I use when lifts are in working order?
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:14:58
Also typo: “See the information page to learn more about Subjects like Bicoin,Blokchain,Altcoins.” It’s - bitcoin and blockchain 
@_date: 2018-09-14 06:09:22
Did you sent 0.091 btc and expected 91 btc back?
@_date: 2018-09-15 20:19:19
Mine too
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:23:27
You right, is there a website tool to see address and activity in general?
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:15:23
Yes, but if I run my fold for few days, eventually it will get accepted no?
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:06:11
In other words: future tech would bring the end to our current tech. If miners would be using quantum computers then the difficulty would be sky high for our current ASICS
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:15:25
Very good
@_date: 2018-09-19 05:54:52
Here we go again...
@_date: 2018-09-15 11:20:53
Take a picture of your paper wallet and shows up here, in order to answer your question

@_date: 2018-09-15 20:18:05
So a bank will control your keys for convenience sake... bitcoin was invented to get away from centralised banking system... and if banks start doing this then what’s the point, you might as well use fiat
@_date: 2018-09-13 10:28:05
So what does it mean? Article doesn’t say much apart from BTC being more popular
@_date: 2018-09-14 06:07:51
Buy high, sell low
@_date: 2018-09-22 21:04:48
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:43:30
I was making a point about the security of paper wallets, if you don’t understand this you can easily disclose to the whole internet and your money can get stolen very quickly 
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:18:19
The last Bitcoin is estimated to be mined in 2140. Move along now 
@_date: 2018-09-15 17:11:06
This is gold
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:37:19
BTC has developers now.. you right about they wouldn’t have happened without Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:49:42
It might or not
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:12:09
Hold on, you create a fork, and since your fork will be longer and longer, after a while (few days maybe) other miners will eventually accept your fork and discard the other, so you can stop your attack, this might take few days though 
@_date: 2018-09-08 12:11:18
“In Bitcoin since 2005” would sound even bette
@_date: 2018-09-30 20:30:44
Would you drink ketchup if wrong?

We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land, and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: It is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be.

Why do I need to hit enter button on that site? I already entered the site?
@_date: 2018-09-14 10:38:07
You create a fraudulent block and start chaining to it, since you have the majority, statistically you win more and chain more blocks to it
@_date: 2018-09-08 15:12:31
 - very good intro to bitcoin and crypto in general, although a little bit dated
@_date: 2018-09-28 12:39:23
Fifty fifty 
@_date: 2018-09-12 12:25:51
Wallmart is selling chocolate called “bitcoin” for $1 
@_date: 2018-09-13 10:17:27
I love crypto, one guy is chosen to eat dick, another drink ketchup 
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:23:37
You right, is there a website tool to see addresses and activity in general?
@_date: 2018-09-29 21:17:56
Not the first time. There were good old days when some people were having sea shells as money
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:40:08
First mover advantage 
@_date: 2018-09-14 10:26:46
So you saying once it became something it was already too late for 51% attack, possibly 
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:17:25
Usually it’s the other way around, buy at $7000 then sell at $6000
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:34:44
The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin. The Crash. 
Ah, the rollercoaster of crypto world
@_date: 2018-09-13 20:51:51
Would you drink ketchup if you are wrong?
@_date: 2018-09-30 11:56:09
@_date: 2018-09-29 16:33:35
If we entertain that thought, how is bitcoin crashing this simulation exactly?
@_date: 2018-09-13 10:36:19
Perhaps, until next bullrun, when alts always outperform btc 
@_date: 2018-09-12 12:08:14
Good luck Chinese girl

Thanks, reading now. But there is nothing stopping me to double spent those fake bitcoins
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:48:29
Me neither

@_date: 2018-09-13 10:08:11
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:35:57
My bad
@_date: 2018-09-15 17:23:00
How can a bank accept bitcoin? You mean store it in their safe?
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:11:44
Big if true
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:47:29
You must be new. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 20:45:33
He hasn’t mentioned “eating dick”
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:18:06
Then you have your answer
@_date: 2018-09-12 08:58:34
What are the laws exactly?
@_date: 2018-09-14 10:29:46
I find bitcoin fascinating too, simple on one hand but extremely complicated on the other. However world is full of scammers who just need profit and don’t care about the tech, so I find it strange when bitcoin was $1 nobody tried to create some sort scam and claim $1m worth of bitcoins
@_date: 2018-10-03 06:04:46

@_date: 2018-10-01 20:12:11
I am sceptical
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:51:42
@_date: 2018-10-01 11:23:49
I say $10,000,000
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:20:14
Buy high, sell low is the only way, brother
@_date: 2018-10-06 20:58:56
Seriously? You posting it here?
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:28:43
