There are expected to be 21 million Bitcoins, and infinite dollars. One Bitcoin is not worth one dollar. However, a Bitcoin may be worth many many dollars and is pretty much able to be divided as much as you need it to be.

You mean give away their money?
Probably because it actually has considerable value now and people do whatever they want with their money?

I could probably bet my entire portfolio (and win) that he doesn't actually understand crypto.
Also, why not provide a link to the article..?

I was saying the same to a friend just now.
Warren Buffett can be directly quoted saying he stays away from investing in tech because he tends to not understand it. If he passed on Google and Amazon (which he totally did), how can I expect him to understand Bitcoin and the wide uses of blockchain?

If only things were that simple, my friend.

The main thing is having access to your private keys. Which an exchange wallet would not provide you.

Because one Bitcoin =/= one USD, but one Bitcoin can = $1,000,000 if the market wants.

It's already behaved like gold in countries where their main currency has been wrecked by inflation or tanked by some sort of centralization. You see people look to store their money in other places, and Bitcoin has been one of the places. As for my sources, you'd have to do a web search perhaps.
