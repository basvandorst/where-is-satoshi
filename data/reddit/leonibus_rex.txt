That is a very valid point but at the same time news reporters who follow bitcoin are on other forums, and digital currency sites and that propagates into larger media formats.

PT shares are full shares. You are thinking of TAT.Asicminer shares which are 1/100th of a full share.

Those ASIC's have to be made and shipped first. With the current rate of production (for all the companies minus ASICMiners) that could be 2 years before all planned hashing power comes online.

1. Yes it does decrease output for the existing miners but it also fortifies the overall network helping to prevent someone attempting a 51% dominance. If you look at existing Avalon/BFL (not to mention the new ASIC players out there) pre-order numbers they could easily overtake the network if those units where in a single person/groups hands. I say keep shipping ASICs the more power the end users have the more secure the network.
2. How would you restrict access for an open source application? Even if pools rejected new miners you can still solo mine at your own discretion.

How do you figure that? His profit potential is based on the amount of time he mines with them. Granted if he is trying to make a profit within the next 90 days, then yes this is a bad investment, but if he is looking at a long term scenario (ie. 24+ months) he has a good chance at turning a profit.

Passthrough and full shares are the same thing. A passthrough just denotes that your shares are held at a trading company. 200 x 4.3(current rate on btc-tc)= 860 BTC to get where you want to be.

All you can do is wait. Even if there is no Tx fee it will still get confirmed. It just may take a little longer.

These are all 2012 orders. At their current rate 2013 orders should start shipping around November December

Let me guess. You have a lot of Bitcoins and no companion.

You agreed to pay a price for a service. Stop complaining because they have a high profit margin on the service. It's call capitalism!

Approximately 200 based on a .02 dividend.

Not really about depreciation more so about gaining wider acceptance in mainstream retail markets. Most large companies will refuse to do business with things associated with nefarious activities.

I'm not inferring that bitcoin can only be used for charity or legal trade. I'm just saying some things are better left in the shadows unseen and unheard. FYI if the US would reevaluate it's arcane and inadequate drug policies we probably wouldn't be having this conversation, but that's a topic for a different subreddit.
