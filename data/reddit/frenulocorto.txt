yes, address is changed, i updated it in the post, please retry now

Interesting post.
The obvious limitation is that you can't send more than $10 a time.
Also, i think there is a limit on max size of a channel, something like 0.014 if i don't remember wrong, so probably you can't open a $1000 channel, but i'm not sure.
Let's see if someone more expert on LN will respond.

Thanks, i updated the tutorial removing the electrum installation part.
However, why do you plan to remove electrum support on desktop version? Do you suppose all desktop users running a bitcoin full node?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:35:53
sure, just 18 months TM

At the moment it's not released to pubblic for mainnet use, only some tests beetween developers. Also, it has limitations, for example what if you get that 6500sat and the channel get closed for any reason? All lost in tx fee. I hope i'm wrong but maybe LN is ovverrated here. But let's see.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:03:23
signature from that address or it didn't happen
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:13:39
don't thinks devs want to increase blocksize...transactions on mainnet are going to be more and more expensive. Also LN needs transactions to open/close channels.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:43:50
What a stupid post, so why we don't use a blocksize of 50kb? The blocks will be full in any case lol.
Yes, but with more blocksize, fees will be lower and more people can use it. There is here a user from venuezuela, he said average montly income there is about 4-5 USD, and we have 10$ fee for a tx? Ridicolous.
Regarding LN, it still need tx for opening/closing channels. So if it will be widely used, a blocksize incresase will still be needed.
So, we need a blocksize inrease, not like "8mb tomorrow", but a schedule like "double the blocksize every N years" or some similar rule.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:48:12
ok. So closing a channel will always take hours, to prevent this scam? How many hours exactly?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:07:26
hey, checked signature and it's valid :). Good for you, I was just sceptic because there are many trolls who says similar things. If you feel generous: bc1qtlh5uqltpjcj043qc7s5n0r08v24k9xs5jtksf. Don't ask too much, also 0.01 or less will be very good. Note it's also a segwit wallet, and we love segwit, right?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:22:02
please stop these shit thread, 6500 satoshi is basically impossibile to transfer because of fees

I made a guide on how to test lightning on testnet: 
If someone wants to try some transaction in testnet, give it a read and try. I had strange results in my tests, some transaction did succeed, other had routing problems. Don't know if i'm noob or if there are still some bug in the software (that would be normal for an alpha version)
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:55:32
UPDATE: seems routing problems are gone now, i can send without problems to all addresses in yalls.org, here are some examples 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:45:29
Thanks for your feedback! Yes, I know that also setting up bitcoin core is not coplicated, but i preferred using electrum because there is no need to download the blockchain. Testnet blockchain is lighter than mainnet blockchain but it's still many GB, and I thought dowloading it may discourage many users. Of course this guide is intended only for testing, not for use in mainnet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:47:17
Read here: 
"The testnet is an alternative Bitcoin block chain, to be used for testing. Testnet coins are separate and distinct from actual bitcoins, and are never supposed to have any value. This allows application developers or bitcoin testers to experiment, without having to use real bitcoins or worrying about breaking the main bitcoin chain."
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:42:08
I don't know the reason of that error, i didn't had similar errors. What version of electrum are you using? I used 2.8.3
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:16:50


please explain why this is necessary, i've never well undestood this point. Is it not safe to open a channel and then go offline? If not, it's a serious limitation.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:12:57
Very useful post, thanks.
If someone wants to do some tests, post here your address and i'll send him some testnet-satoshis

very interesting, but please do a fucking gui, nobody will use it without a gui, so do it. Not "soon", but NOW.

best thing to to is:
1) move your BTC to another paper wallet (better do all on an offline pc)
2) install "electron cash" and import keys of old paper wallets in it (these andresses will have 0BTC, but have the BCH)
3) now you can sell them on an exchange
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:55:15
Can you mine a non-standard tx if I provide the raw transaction?
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:15:06
you don't have to send all your btc to a single exchange in one time.
Use multiple exchanges and little amounts a time.
You can also exchange with private users on bitcointalk, but be very careful to scams, only exchange with very trusted users.

Best thing is a paper wallet with electrum.
1) Use a secure machine. For example:
- a pc that will be always offline
- a live-USB secure linux distro like Tails ( disabling all network connection in the initial menu
2) generate a new wallet, and manually write down the seed on a piece of paper (that will be your paper wallet). Never store that seed on electric devices (ex. cell phones etc.)
3) open that wallet and do a photo with your cell phone or camera to the QR codes of one or more addresses of that wallet.
4) turn off the machine
5) using the QR code of addresses, retrieve the addresses strings and send the BTC to them
Hardware wallet like trezor are also a valid choice but a paper wallet is cheaper and simple. Personally i'd buy a trezor only if I would need to move that coins frequently.

good, it's a good paper wallet, very easy to import to many software.
Simplest thing is using electrum to import it.
Using electrum:
file --&gt; new/restore --&gt; standard wallet --&gt; use public or private key.
Here you can scan the private key's qr code using webcam by clicking on the "read QR code" icon (on bottom-right). If you use windows the scan by webcam will not work, so you'll have to enter it manually in the textbox or use third-party tools to read the QR code (however it will be insecure to use online QR reading services!)
After that the key will be imported in electrum and you can spend the BTC on the paper wallet.
For better security, expecially if you have many BTC, best thing is not using the OS you use every day, best thing is using a live-USB linux distribution, like tails: 
Tails comes with electrum included, so you'll not have to install it.
But want do you want to do with your BTC? Move BTC, sell BTH, and move all resulting BTC to another paper wallet?

using your paper wallet, make a transaction that moves BTC to the addres of the new paper wallet.
If you tell me exactly what kind of paper wallet you have, i can give you more detailed info on how to move that BTC

It's because reddit is full of normies.
I certainly like when bitcoin goes up, but it's not the only reasonon why i like bitcoin.
I like bitcoin because of freedom (as in "free speech", not "free beer" lol :) )

how much is bitcoin "famous" in your country? Do "normal" people know about it?

How to run electrum on testnet? Is there a particular server to choose?
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:46:31
I assumed he started to buy bitcoins 3 years ago. If he started earlier than that, yes, he probably spent much lower than 100k$
