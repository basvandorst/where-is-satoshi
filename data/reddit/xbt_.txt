You need their id too. Steal someone’s wallet and you have their credit card and ID card which is enough to buy some bitcoin on Coinbase. Credit card transactions are pretty low the first week though on new accounts probably for this exact reason.

Forced liquidation sounds like one reason to instead prefer a salt loan. If he has enough bitcoins to handle a down market and still make payments on his salt loan while bitcoin recovers then he might lose less money or even still profit in the long run.
Either way, sounds risky.

One thing I’ve never seen mentioned is how although bitcoin isn’t tangible it very much has characteristic of a ‘thing’ that is real and must be protected. When you obtain a bitcoin you own its private key, which is what gives it its value, makes it unique and makes it similar to a file on your computer where if you lose it or destroy it then it’s gone. Similar to an object in the physical word. 
Whenever I hear people say bitcoin isn’t something real, I have to disagree. Private keys are absolutely real and without them there is no bitcoin.
Edit: spelling

In the latest episode  of LetsTalkBitcoin they aired guest Peter Todd. He had a very pessimistic view of Bitcoin's future due to fundamental problems in Bitcoin. Such as, Bitcoin being too inflexible to change if there is a problem arises. In the future there will not be enough incentive to mine. Scaleability. Threats of large mining pools and a number of other real concerns. I'd love to hear his thought on Peter Todd, his comments and if he agrees that the fundamentals of Bitcoin are such that it's doomed to fail. I'm not speaking of crypto currencies as a whole, strictly Bitcoin itself.

Whoa that link took me to him stating the following 
“In reality,  I ran for California state assembly in 2000 as a Libertarian / Voluntarist.
I said enough to upset the feds so much that I became the only person in the USA to be prosecuted for selling a legal product 
that was also being sold by hundreds of other companies across the USA including 
There is no freedom of speech.
This is why the world needs Bitcoin, and this is why I support bitcoinfoundation.org”
Didn’t know he ran for state assembly. I wonder what he said to upset the feds.
I’m not a Ver fan but if the above is true then his character assassination over that incident seems pretty unfair and if anything that incident supports everything bitcoin is about.  To not have to worry about upsetting the feds and taking some control away from them.

Doesn't change much other than slowing someone down a tiny bit tracing the transaction backwards to the original source. It's literally like drawing a bunch of lines backwards from point to point until complete and now there's software that does that. Don't use bitcoin for anonymity.

This is the correct answer. Long been solved.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:04:49
I think you mean blockchain. Bitcoin itself will never disrupt the whole world and financial system. We need intermediaries who provide services around investments. Bitcoin alone doesn’t provide that and doesn’t function as a global currency. At least not until the largest central banks can more easily convert their currency into bitcoin instead of USD and we work out all the number of problems that face bitcoin.
Right now it’s primarily speculative asset and an amazing store of value.
We already see large institutions trying to fork bitcoin to take control. I’m not saying bitcoin won’t be under attack, it already is. But I don’t believe it’ll be regulated out of existence (it can’t be). It’ll be hostile attacks through the network, nodes, hashing power, 51% attacks, large actors that’ll attempt to take control of it for themselves. 
Until then, we’ll continue to see it climb in price.

I'm sure their support is better. Their interface looks better as well, although it doesn't appear they accept credit cards (which some people prefer for the miles/points etc). 
I do like they only require 3 confirmations for BTC transfers to appear (coinbase is 6).
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:32:00
I agree with you except to call Bitcoin better forms of money over fiat.. i can spend fiat anywhere while only some places for bitcoin and it’s becoming less fungible with its huge transaction fees and congested network. 
Otherwise yes, fiat is completely manipulated and we had no idea who owns what or how many shares actually exist of a thing.

@_date: 2017-11-04 05:51:51
I guess it depends on what you mean by meddling. Or control. They can’t control bitcoin, it’s decentralized and secured by currently unbreakable math. That’s the whole point. They could regulate exchanges out of business but I doubt that would happen at this point. 
People have been saying the US government would stifle bitcoin for years but it hasn’t happened. China has banned bitcoin (among many other countries) in various forms multiple times and they were a dominate force in the price in the beginning and now even with it banned the price is still going exponential. 
With so many companies, Silicon Valley, financial institutions lining up to implement Blockchain technology or use bitcoin in some fashion its not something that is going away. I liken it to the creation of the internet. There will definitely be a blockchain 1.0 bust, but I don’t think governments are going to be the cause. 
My 2 cents.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:53:50
RemindMe! 28days
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:39:04
I think it’s optimistic to believe that people will suddenly have more money to put into bitcoin during a US stock market crash. If anything people will liquidate what they can. When stocks crash so do profits and companies end up laying people off to bear the squeeze. Unemployment goes up and there is less disposable cash available to flow into things like crypto. Everything gets squeezed when companies and people aren’t making the same money as they used to.
I don’t believe bitcoin is going anywhere I just think market crash would slow down the available funds into it. Stocks and our economy are doing better than ever right now so it’ll be less than what we’re currently experiencing.
But besides a US stock market collapse... if something more globally happens that causes distrust in all currencies then maybe that could cause an even greater influx to bitcoin (although what we have now is pretty damn impressive). Not sure what that would look like but I feel like we’re headed that direction. Many countries have negative interest rates so it seems something global is brewing.

First, use GDAX to set limit orders. It has the volume and stability you’ll want for orders to actually execute. Limit orders are considered market makers and you won’t pay trading fees.
Second, be willing to accept that you’ll sell and the market will move up higher than you have limit orders set and not come back down, or faster than you can place new orders and you’ll now have to buy back in at that higher price.
You’ll later look back and realize you would’ve just made more money buying and holding with much less stress. 
I’m sure you’ll execute some good trades though and have fun and sometimes that’s more than worth it. 
Good luck!

It worries me a bit when people believe bitcoin provides much beyond pseudo anonymity. I would use cash or something like monero if I was after privacy in transactions. That would make this app more interesting to me. 
Pretty sure the average consumer has no qualms sharing financial data considering the use of social financial apps like Venmo, or even apps that log into all your bank accounts or track purchases like mint, personal capital even gmail. Convenience wins out.

I guess what got me thinking about 401K is lalicat and others who mentioned they're dipping into theirs. And made me want to do the same, but not suffer any penalties doing so. The upside problem will be that if in 6-8 weeks the price is significantly higher, it'll be another gamble to just let it ride if it makes sense to pay the taxes and penalties and keep the BTC bankrolled.

Everyone except coinbase. As that's the number for merchants. If you're not a merchant then you're now increasing the wait time for everyone as you're calling line not ment for everyday support and they have to take time to answer it and explain to you to simply write in a support email. 
If they wanted you to call their support team then they'd provide a number.

Optional? Aren't major exchanges like Coinbase going to be reporting to the IRS as good tax paying citizens, thus any BTC profit you move back into your checking account will count towards capital gains? Maybe we need a lawyer in here. I'm also worried the Senate meeting this month could also cause some serious waves in the US as they crank down and try to regulate as fast as possible to try to control loss taxes.
edit: Coinbase does not report to the IRS, the onus is on you to do that. (Coinbase support)

You should watch Coinmarketcap because while I agree with you long term, altcoins have been out performing bitcoin by large numbers this past week. I believe money trickles downwards into other cheap coins as psychologically it feels much better to own many of some random coin than to own .1 BTC. This alone will keep many of these altcoins around not to mention people can actually try to mine them which is part of the fun.

Yeah, this is a tired debate and don't want to comment beyond explaining the counter argument is those who say cash is more anonymous because there is no transaction recorded in a public leger. Apparently FINcen agrees as stated in the Senate hearings, that cash is the preferred method of buying drugs for a long time to come. They had no trouble shutting down silk road and Bitcoin it's not nearly as anonymous as it was first claimed to be. That's just not a quality of Bitcoin. Actually it's quite good for tracking, profiling and analysing senders, receivers and track the flow of money. Governments only wish to have that sort of public intelligences with cash transactions. Just saw a white paper today called BitIodine that explains how to pull lots of detailed information from the blockchain.

In the same vein, it pains me that Coinbase fees are so high. The first time I mentioned that I got down-voted to hell by all the Coinbase fanboys, but if you buy BTC nearly any other way (avoiding the word exchange since coinbase isn't), you'll quickly see you're not getting gouged so hard. They just have a stranglehold on the US market being the only ACH transfer point. Congrats on moving your business elsewhere with lower fees!

Look, as soon as you put your toe into Bitcoin you're going to see the astronomical returns and wish you had put everything in. So depending on your situation (family, mortgage, debit, etc) I'm of the mindset to put way more in that you're normally comfortable with. Feel it out, then pull your initial investment out in a few months. 
Or you can always play it safe ;)

When silk road was seized the market came back even strong proving that illegal activity was not the majority of the market. It's speculators that fuel the bitcoin ecosphere, you can see this by how new user signups everywhere are exploding right now. How much of the market is illegal activity is unknown but I wouldn't say it's a majority. I just interviewed a random guy at work today and he briefly mentioned he just bought an ASIC. I think it's clear that Bitcoin is mainstream, it was mainly the underground market that helped start it in my opinion, which for that I thank them.

@_date: 2013-11-22 15:37:58
Agreed. I use SF Fire credit union and have had weeks with a few 10K+ transfers in a row in both directions with no trouble at all. I called them and asked about it, and they said unless its 100K+ or looks unusual, they generally won't stop the transaction. Since I started small with coinbase and built up, must not look unusual.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:58:39
Disclaimer: I'm very bullish and do believe BTC will exceed at least 5K this year. 
But I worry that people are put off by it's high price for 1 coin and much of the spectators are already in the market. We've seen that the exponential rise already has had a major dip and is slowing. I don't think mBTC is enough to solve the psychological effects of knowing how much a whole coin is since we've been yelling about it in the press. New adopters (such as my family members) are much less enthused about buying into bitcoin when they know how much cheaper it use to be and thus buy less or don't want to buy in at all at this point. Thoughts?

Every security option has it's trade-offs. Do you trust someone else more than yourself? I don't. Exchanges are bigger targets for coins than the individual because the payoff is larger. Also, the breaches can come from many angles, someone 'internal' running off with the coins IE exchanges running off with ALL money, MITM attacks, someone exploits their servers or website and once in control ALL coins available vanish. OR external attacks, password cracking, phishing, etc. 2FA only helps a limited amount of situations.
Cold storage obviously has it's trade offs. You better make sure you have multiple secure copies in multiple trusted locations and that you can access your money if a natural disaster or theft strikes. 
There's no perfect solution, it's what works for you.
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:25:26
that's exactly what I did. Instead of pulling out my bitcoin profits into fiat, I diverted that amount into a couple altcoins a few days, and glad I did. It's earning a lot more money than sitting in my bank account.

Same, doesn't really matter the price, I tend to buy when there's a dip of at least 10-15%. Or a couple times when I had sold some coins before the last double top prediction or when I was very confident the market was headed down and I needed to buy back in afterwards lower.

That's good advice. That's the one variable I CAN control is waiting to withdraw the money via ACH. So although I won't be able to catch a flash crash, I could use the money to buy in with a 3-4 day window if the market stayed down a bit. Although it seems to rebound quicker and quicker these days.

I dealt with this exact thing yesterday trying to buy a whole foods gyft card while standing in whole foods. 15 minutes later, payment never received and I'm still standing there with my groceries and phone in hand like a fool. Installed blockchain app and transferred money to it so that won't happen again. Block chain lets you increase the transfer fee too if you want to so that you can get your confirmations much faster. I'm still waiting on my refund from bitpay and coinbase saga. They actually owe me two refunds. Which I've had to do in the past and I do eventually get them.

With every disruption there will be new opportunities for many new businesses and jobs to emerge. The old fashion banks will be affected by Bitcoin in many ways, but new Bitcoin financial institutions will emerge out of this. I personally don't think we need to try to get any of the old style financial institutions 'on our side' per se. They might very well fight us to the death like the music industry fought napster, but ultimately those who adopted the Bitcoin protocol and help institutionalize the crypto-currency industry will come with us into the future and succeed. But it's not going to be overnight.

No, the majority are PRO coinbase. It just sounds anti-coinbase because reddit has essentially become their second support forum because they're so extremely popular. You don't hear much of their success stories, because those people have nothing to complain about but people use them successfully all the time. Myself included. And I have had many of their transactions clear bitpays confirmation window near instantly. There's not always this delay, it's just unpredictable.

What's wrong with you? You have no idea when I invested or how many coins I have. I've diversified much of my BTC portfolio into altcoins because I have coins to spare. You shouldn't make such blind assumptions. To give you some perspective, I was a miner in 2009 and I also mine many coins before they're on exchanges. I have many protoshares for example, mining them the day they came out. Also, nobody can predict the future so for all you know bitcoin could fail and another one take it's place, just like myspace. So don't be so naive and narrow minded.

Nothings forcing you to use Coinbase. You can always wire money to a non US exchange or even trade for free at BTCChina, others are doing it.
But currently, they filled the void in a country that is regulation heavy and hard to exist. So for now, they're the best we've got.

triangular btc/altcoin arbitrage seems doable, leaving fiat out of the picture until the end to cash out.

Maybe I don't understand the right length of time to gain an advantage from dollar cost averaging but I'm beginning to think it's a terribly bad idea for most people. I made a spreadsheet of all my BTC buys over the 8 months and for me, I could clearly see the longer I waited the more I was paying. Bitcoin is much too deflationary. Now I just try to buy in whenever there is a 5-10% dip in price and ride it up! But the sooner the better imo and hold long!
