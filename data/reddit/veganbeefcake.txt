I tried using VARIOUS bch wallets, including the original btc.com wallet that was put out to help people recover their BCH after the fork. I tried asking various people, on various forums and got sick of people who kept giving up and thinking I was retarded. After being helped, I was shown that Coinomi is the only app (only offered on android devices) that will work if you send BCH to a BTC paper wallet.

Yep. More complicated than it appears. The people who tried to help me kept saying “just do this!” or “just do that!” as if I was completely ignorant, so I figured I’d reward the person who didn’t assume and proved it instead :)

Come on.
Not a scam. Simply need help :(

It appears insanely simple, BUT I had tried MULTIPLE wallets with the BCH sweep feature and they would not work with the BTC paper wallets... including the original BTC.com tool that was put out to recover BCH after the fork. 
Apparently Coinomi is the only one that works and I️ would not have known without I’m thankful.

We’re both quite happy now.
That’s how it should be :) 
Still kinda ticked someone called it a scam though hahah... whatever :)
