I'm a wrong? When I think that when 10 times more people want to own and use Bitcoins, that it's harder for those new people to get all those wanted coins if the current free-flow available coins, which are only enough for the current 1 time amount of people? Doesn't it force the price (much) higher just by a 10 fold demand?

further: laws of arbitration, will result in an equilibrium between BOTH: Bitcoin and Litecoin...so NO over-price BTC nor over-priced LTC: they will slowly grow to the same prices on both exchanges (a small difference will be caused by their trade-fees and transport-fees).

"Tyler Cowen's" piece is flawed in many ways. Two of them, I will try to debug below.
 Two flaws are pregnant:
 1) he mixes Centralized and Decentralized economics.
 2) he doesn't reckon the differences between SHA256 and sCrypt networks.
 The first point: he writes "But then the QuitCoin company comes along" and this one (central) company competes with a lower price, forcing Bitcoin (decentralized network) to lower its price. Well, this may work in a centralized economy, where the one supplier can set his price, but this isn't possible in a decentralized economy. First of all a Central-Coin cannot compete with a decentralized Coin (it misses essential features). And secondly, if QuitCoin would be a decentralized-coin then it cannot set its price (price is pure on Supply-of-many and Demand). Actually, to become a real competitor to Bitcoin, QuitCoin's supplier-profit (the miners in the decentralized network) should be much higher than Bitcoin's. The incentive for miners should be higher in order to persuade miners to switch from Bitcoin to another network. Which means an upward price pressure instead of a downward as Tyler Cowen argues.
 The Second point: He doesn't understand what it takes to issue a new decentralized Coin. Sure, Bitcoin is open-source, can be copied very easily, and use top class marketing to promote it. But that will not make a new Coin, let alone be a serious competitor to Bitcoin. No! a decentralized coin needs an as large as possible P2P network of miners (the larger the more secure). This means that tens of thousands, geographically separated, individuals need to invest in costly equipment and electricity to connect to each other and mine the new coins. It took Bitcoin 5 years and more than $200.000.000 (in 2013 alone) to create the network of today. It should be clear that any new coin who wants to compete with (nearly) the same copy of open-source code has a nearly impossible task to gather enough miners for its new network: professional Miners will only join if incentives and success-rate are better than Bitcoin.
 I see you thinking: but why do we have so many copycat-coins?
 To answer this you need to separate the two encryption families: The SHA256, which needs extremely expensive ASIC-hardware. And sCrypt which can be mined by common PC's with a gaming-video-card. Bitcoin is member of the SHA256 family, and because of its hardware costs ($5000 to $13000 per Miner) is run by professionals. These professionals will not easily switch their expensive hardware to a new Coin. And this is why Bitcoin doesn't have any serious competition within the SHA256-family (PPC is a runner up, but I'm not aware of any shop that accepts them). And be aware: SHA256-hardware, physically cannot be used in sCrypt-networks, the opposite is possible but not profitable at all.
 The major coin in the sCrypt-family is Litecoin. And yes, Litecoin is a competitor to Bitcoin (which is a good thing). Litecoin is a keeper, it was the first in the sCrypt-family and its network has grown in 2 years time to more than 40.000 Miners (a stable and secure network indeed). 
 In contrast to the SHA256, the sCrypt-family has many copycat-coins. But they all compete with Litecoin (not Bitcoin). Many Litecoin-copycats try to lure Litecoin sCrypt-miners to their coins, but that proves to be hard (but much easier than Bitcoin, due to the fact that many kids and amateurs, switch their relative cheap sCrypt-hardware for a few days to new networks to make a quick buck). In order to succeed, new coins need to attract Miners permanently (for security and supply) and it needs demand (which doesn't exist if it hasn't any major improvement). These copycat-developers try pump &amp; dump schemes and are in no way competitive to Bitcoin (in contrast to what Tyler Cowen suggests).

(3600 coins per day) x $580 = $2,088,000 divided by 100,000,000 Ghs = $0.02 per day per ghs
Edit: as the post I replied to is deleted, I will add the following for danster82 below:
Indeed if costs and difficulty-increase will be added: those CEX contracts are NEVER profitable.
If hashrate grows to 1,000,000,000 Ghs in one year from now, then the average earning will be $0.011 per day per Ghs: then a $4.35 contract will need 394 days to earn it back...which is a lot more then 1 year (meaning impossible to earn it back) and then we haven't calculated the costs/maintenance fees yet...
Without costs, a "fair" price, only to break even would be $4.01, but with costs/maintenance about 40 cents needs to be subtracted (I have copied this 40 cents from a poster above, without checking)... so everything above $3.60 per CEX contract is hugely overpriced, as it will ONLY give you break-even after one full year of risk.

Again: my Dutch fiat Bank doesn't ask any questions if I move around less than $25000. That's just the Dutch law... as is in many European countries. 
Now, when I move only $2000 value from bitstamp to my same Dutch bank, it's Bitstamp asking these ridicules questions and blocks my funds. Bitstamp is very aware of me being Dutch complying to the Dutch KYC rules, so I don't want to be bothered with USA kind of KYC issues which hampers my financial freedom. So: I chose Kraken if they treat me better.

I wonder if Ripple gives them a much better system than SWIFT, my guess is that the blockchain technology holds more useful features.
What about this idea:
Their goal is to offer their clients "nearly immediate bank transactions between different banks, even in the weekends". 
A solution could be to use the Bitcoin blockchain to transact Micropayments in Euro-tokens (think about 0.00000125 BTC to transmit 1.25 Euro), then balance/process these transactions on both sides of the banks, and once a day process one big SWIFT transaction to settle/clear the difference (in real Euros).
Such a system has many advances:
1) it uses the blockchain security, speed and inexpensiveness.
2) doesn't have any price volatility issues (Euro tokens)
3) Banks don't need large BTC holdings
4) works 24/7
Drawback, is that this will not support BTC as currency (only its blockchain technology).

You should ask him, to put his money were his mouth is!  If he's so sure that THIS summer Bitcoin dumps below $10 then ask him why he hasn't the balls to go Short (and he can at bitfinex.com and icbit).

You can explain scarcity better by explaining that the Ledger has a limited number of pages (excel sheets) to account the debt. The Miners are in essence "Accountants" who add each 10 minutes a new sheet with debt-transactions. And for this work one lucky Accountant get 25 units for that page of work. This 25 units is debt (and there by money) "given" by all users of the Ledger to the accountant, for his work.
Understanding this, gives you the way to explain scarcity. As there are only a small number of ledger-pages with 50 and 25 debt-units. And each 10 minutes only one page is added, and the total number of future pages is fixed (the Ledger will never have more than xxx pages after 150 years of work with 22 million debt-units maximum ).
As there are currently only 12 million debt-units (called Bitcoins), their value will rise as many want to own these useful units, to administrate the digitally ownership of debt.

I don't like this Doc that much.

This documentary doesn't explain why Bitcoin will/can attract mainstream in 2014/15, but shows too much the 2013 feeling of illegality. CNBC is still too slow to catch the vibrant fast moving reality of Bitcoins eco-system.

In the Netherlands we have 3 Boxes, with each their own taxing regime.  Box-1 is for income-tax, Box-3 is for possessions (bank-accounts, stocks, houses). So for the Dutch-IRS, the Bitcoin-possessions are in Box-3.  (Mining for as a business, would be in Box-1: income-Tax).
It's most economical to have as much as possible in box-3, as box-3 is a Property-tax: only taxed at 1.4% and below 42k (if married) no tax at all.
There is no "profit-Tax" in the Netherlands. So if your Bitcoin-possessions have a 100% value increase next year, then you don't pay a profit-tax.  You only have a (much) larger possession (in Euro's) next year, and pay 1.4% over the total.

The floor is determined by the Physical-network, its costs to keep it running. Miners invest in expensive ASICs and pay electricity-bills: they aren't willing to sell their mined coins below this value
