Problem is that most people who dont know about Bitcoin/Cryptocurrencies only hear that criminals use it.  However i use this same argument that criminals mainly use cash and have done since it was invented thousands of years ago.

"just do encryption, run core, back up, airgap, timelock" 
You do realise that this sentence alone is like an alien language to 95% of the worlds population? Most people are not going to fuck around with all this shit EVER. Good useable tech will need to do all this for them without them even knowing its happening, for true mass adoption.
