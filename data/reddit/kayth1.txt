I used to trust Ledger and Trezor somehow because there are well known person behind the company, but your quote let me think about this again :) 
*"Prediction: there will be popular hardware wallet brands compromised by insiders.*"
Thank you cointastical.

Sure, paper wallets are fine if you don't want to spend your Bitcoin. And if you know how to create them properly. But even if you are a hardcore hodler, one time you (or your kids) have to spend that Bitcoin and then they need to trust a piece of software. At least if you don't want to build the transaction by your own. And the question is, how you guys deal with the the issue, that then you have to trust in a software you didn't write by yourself and therefore cannot be 100% sure that it's not malicious.

So you trust in Trezor. Ok, but why? Because a lot of people are using Trezor? A lot of people trusted in Bernie Madoff as well.

I had the same issue, I stopped app through Android app settings, after that syncing was fine again.

Thank you :)

Thank you! Yah I know this situation as well. :) But... I keep on going.  
I used the common and well known paper wallets you can find on Google. Be sure you know what you do because there are a lot of pitfalls with paper wallets. Meanwhile there are bech32 generators as well, so next time I will check them for sure.

Satoshis are Bitcoin, so you can get ut on every exchange (like Bitstamp, Kraken...) and you can get as well only few Satoshis there usually. But be sure transaction fee is not eating all the Satoshis you purchased ;) 1 Bitcoin = 100000000 Satoshis. It's like Dollar and Cents.

Oh I run a full node, don't worry. :) I even made an app for that as well by the way [  
 If people like the app, I (or maybe anyone else) will be happy to improve the app in a way that you can do this checks to your own node instead to Blockstreams API.
@_date: 2019-10-13 23:50:49
Sure, you can do everything by yourself. It's just less user friendly and needs more knowledge and time.
@_date: 2019-10-13 13:46:20
yah, you have to trust the app (but it's opensource, clone it, review it and build it on your own) and you have to trust Blockstream that they do not analyse your requests (because the app uses their blockchain explorer API). If I see that people like this app, I (or maybe anyone else) will be happy to improve the app in a way that you can do this checks to your own node instead to Blockstreams API.

You don't really know a lot about the timelock feature, right?
@_date: 2019-10-13 16:20:35
The app uses Java Time API, which was introduced in API level 26   [ I will think about it how I can deal with that.
@_date: 2019-10-13 23:18:39
:D Thank you!

If you just want some Satoshis, get a Lightning wallet e.g. Breeze, I can send you some then.

Thank you! But it wasn't that big deal actually. No server part, no logins, simple UI.

Nothing prevents them. Or not much. Have a look here as well, I asked the same question few weeks ago.

A Satoshi fountain? :D Tell me more.
@_date: 2018-12-31 01:36:32
Oh... cool! I think that's the point I missed! So it may will be possible to go to the nearby store and get some Lightning BTC by cash directly instead of get BTC onchain first and then open a funding channel which needs an onchain transaction? 
@_date: 2018-12-31 01:18:25
Ok, thank you. So no plan yet, time and development will tell us.

I probably have to adjust my posting. Primary goal of Bitcoin is to hold decentralization. Decentralization over scaling. Agreed. And transferring gigabytes of blocks is not a solution. Agreed too. But still I think there will be a scaling issue with the current setup..

"A single 10k bitcoin transaction could give a million people .01 each"
Without increasing that funding transaction size? How? Any link appreciated. Thank you.
