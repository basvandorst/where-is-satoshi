Stepping back from how this impacts bitcoins or whatever.
Doesn't this introduce all sorts of loopholes for campaign contribution limits and such? (if those even still exist?)
Say I, John Doe, can only contribute $2,000 to each candidate each cycle but if I'm donating via bitcoin is it not anonymous? Isn't the point of bitcoin that the transactions are anonymous? What's to stop me from making 100 $2,000 bitcoin donations and playing dumb about them all being from me?
I am probably oversimplifying that by a staggering amount so feel free to ELI5.

You said over 50. Does under 50 get a pass? If they get 2000 donations of $40 there is, I would think, no way to say whether that is one person or 2000 people.

seeing someone on IRC first hand make that claim there's a 99% chance it's bullshit
seeing someone on reddit say they saw someone on IRC make that cleam means there's a 99.99% chance it's bullshit.

"actual money" = about $5 a week? That amount is probably not worth the electricity it takes to run at full tilt and then jack up the ac to compensate. Plus having a hot office. 
I think I just want to do this until I get 2.5 the. I'll be done.

playing a single game of dota 2 raises the room tempt 5 F....running it 24/7 I imagine would be even more substantial

a bank branch? .... i certainly have never seen one of those...
@_date: 2012-03-26 20:17:48
naw i dont live near any big cities so i doubt it
i would love it if someone here would just buy a steam game from me for the coins or something...that seems like it would be less hassle than mining
@_date: 2012-03-26 20:24:29
yeah...for mining all i have to do is download a few programs and hit go while i'm at work and sleeping for two weeks
otherwise i have to set up accounts, figure out how to transfer the money...because they all use sketchy ass bank transfers and stuff....
it's much easier to just run my computer for two weeks imo.
obviously the easiest thing would just be to sell someoen something for 2.5 btc but it would seem nobody on the internet has any interest in that
and yes...i would totally mind paying 2x face value....who wouldnt??

i thought you meant there were bitinstant bank branches...you mean you deposit cash at ANY bank? how does that work?
@_date: 2012-03-26 20:15:58
cool, thanks.
thanks for the sources too
now i guess the only question is can i stand my house being hot for 2 weeks O_o

So how long does it take to confirm? Is that the point I can send it back?
@_date: 2016-07-30 21:56:58
Does the fee affect how quickly it gets processed? And the miners get the fee in exchange for running the network?

thanks mate -- i've sent you a PM. the address would be the one on the receive tab, right? Or one from the "addresses" tab (there are like 40!)

What's that
