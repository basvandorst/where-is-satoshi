But you do get a present for doing your job. That is what getting paid is. My parents gave me a gift for graduating highschool and college. I got a well paying job afterwards and am doing just fine. I don’t exactly see the correlation between getting a gift for graduation and not functioning when you “wen’t to work in the real life”.

Your father sounds like an asshole.

Fine, if you see it that way. But you still fail to address the other 90% of my comment.

We will see, people could get excited and sell back down to $6000 range, or they could get excited and make the decision to hold either I will by back at 6,000&lt; or 7,000. The only way I won't make money is if there is no movement at all.

It was a calculated decision. I saw it jump 10&amp; and I wanted to guarantee I would make that 10&amp; so I sold. I was going to short it if it went back down again.

If there is no actual current reason bitcoin would be used as currency and not just held onto that is a problem with bitcoin not the people who are HOLDing.

If it was useful then people will use it. You can not blame people treating it like a comodity when that has been its best served purpose so far.

If someone bought at 20k and held all the way down to 6k then you are a dumbass. They could have sold at any point and rebought at 6k for a profit.

I’m interested in buying a couple pairs of your shoes, but I noticed sizing only went up to US size 10 do you have any larger sizes?

That's my point. If I could use bitcoin at the grocery store at check out, as easily as I use cash or a credit card I will. But currently it's just not there yet.

Yes I do.
Say you put 10k in at 20k.
If you sold at 10k you will have 5k left.
If you wait till 5k your 10k is now worth 2.5k.
If you sold at 10k (Now you have 5k), and bought again in again at 5k with that 5k you know have more bitcoin if you just HOLD, obviously you would want to buy in at a better number, but holding all the way from 20k down to 5k is retarded.

I’m so sick of hearing this. If there is no advantage to spending bitcoin people will not spend it. That is not a flaw with people. That is a flaw with bitcoin for not being useful enough.

"Obviously you would want to buy in at a better number, but holding all the way from 20k down to 5k is retarded."
Perhaps "For a profit" was the wrong phrasing.
My point is-
If you hold from 20k to 5k you are losing more money then if you sold at 10k and rebought at 5k.

I took the wait and see approach because it went up 10&amp; to 6,300 that is when I sold. So not that big of a deal now that I think of it if it goes back down. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 17:09:52
I knew this was going to fucking happened because I sold last night
