Yeah, the word cunt is as flexible as the words fuck or shit over here, it’s ingrained itself in the vernacular...
The only country where it’s possible to be a “good cunt”, which has gotta count for something, right?

Well then, why haven’t you all taken your guns outside and sorted all of this out? I mean, it happened 16 years ago and I’m yet to see one American shoot the government responsible for that atrocity, which in itself is atrocious!
Arm yourselves, kill the government. Isn’t that the entire reason why your guns are stockpiled 20 high in your gunsafe?
What are you waiting for...? Maybe it’s just taking you all a long time to coordinate your attack, I guess...

The conspiracies are strong within you, young Padawan...

Sounds like poor construction workmanship. Somebody call the union!

I was trying to, but I had to settle for a glass with minced meat and olive oil in it, wedged between the couch pillows.
Perfect height.
Excellent counter argument, by the way. You’re really good at this.

I’d have to go out and purchase some shitty furniture, first. Where did you get yours?
May I also reiterate how much better at this you are than what I originally assumed, if you don’t mind?

How funny would that be? 
I’d have a good laugh since I got my cash out at $AUD23k

Geez, how big is your house?
Good news though, Merry Christmas!

From a psychological point of view, you can see how people would rather own 100,000 of an alt coin as opposed to owning 0.768221 of a bitcoin.
I just purchased 75 million of an extremely low value coin (AUD$0.000004 per) for a measly AUD$300 and, strangely enough, I was like “haha, fuck yeah, I own 75 million of something!” even though it is only worth a pittance.
Had I purchase Bitcoin with that $300 I’d have received a “paltry” 0.01386349BTC, which wouldn’t have been as much fun.
Both worth exactly the same amount in fiat, but psychologically vastly different effects.

what would you like to learn?
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:45:58
Not out of mine, but it did come from an anus, yes.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:48:25
yes, yes it was. That was the point, to get you to admit it.

So by “recovering” do you just mean that those who sold last week and forced the price down are just buying it all back again at the cheap price and keeping the profits made?
Because that’s what it looks like...
