I find it very difficult to use bitcoin, compared to other ways to buy or sell goods. Therefore I'm trying to find out if there are actually people who prefer this method for legal activities. 
So how much do you spend per month on average?

They're actually making an effort to deal with this messy situation! Good to see. :)

So you think that financial sovereignty is the real value of bitcoin? If I observe most people, they don't really care about that. Heck, most of us click away our privacy because we're to lazy to read the "terms of use" of any app. 
Perhaps a very small group really does care about financial sovereignty. So did you trade everything you own for bitcoin to be your own bank and now only use this method of transaction? 
How do you use your bitcoin to be financially sovereign then?

Oh boy, he made three correct predictions within three months?! 
Try three years of correct predictions and it might be interesting to consider reading charts as a working method.

Ah yes the low transaction costs are certainly a bonus! However I noticed that in my daily use I rarely need to transfer money internationally, this is specific for me though but I do see this as a good point for added value. 
So did you eventually get some bitcoin after your initial research?

Haha, nah just curious about your actual use. Thanks for sharing your thoughts and experiences.
