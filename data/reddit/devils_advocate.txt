BIP65 will solve this problem for you anyway.

This is actually exactly the opposite of his point of view.

when Peter Todd's CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY gets added within two years (requires a soft fork), this won't be an issue anymore.  will work seamlessly

whether or not you agree with him -- few here will -- give the guy credit for taking a very unpopular view in silicon valley and at least  articulating a reasonable anti-snowden case. better than most fox news pundits anyway.  his life could have been a lot easier by keeping quiet on the subject, like most folks would in that spot, but he'd rather explore such topics in public arenas like twitter, etc.   EDIT: I have no opinion or thoughts on the snowden case

OP's premise is wrong. For example, see [BIP 65]( In 16-24 months when BIP 65 is added to core, the "7 transactions per second" will be a false constraint.  Like folks who argued the internet wouldn't scale in the 90s and would fall over.

Sorry, I didn't mean about Snowden. I meant this idea about lining his pockets with money. He genuinely cares about a lot of things, but making money isn't his top priority. He's passed on a lot of opportunities to make a lot of $ when it wasn't right.
