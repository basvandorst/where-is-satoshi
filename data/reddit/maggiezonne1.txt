Of course you're trashing bitcoin. Have you really investigated exactly how it works? And?

Am just worried that google and government has become one and the same thing? And… before you know it, that $5.00 mac meal is registered by the NSA? But what do EYE know, I'm an ass.

why would you give them your wallet address? I understand the initial purchase when your bank will reflect something but after that? No-one on G-d's earth knows about your piece of paper, or do they?

sorry, I'm out of the loop here… how does a bank become involved with btc? when really it's not needed at all? why wld one use a bank2bank system using btc when btc operates by itself. Btc to me is a simple system, until i hear the word bank?

Well, here in good ol' south africa, we have SAFES, as in WALKING STUFF. Plus we have electric fencing, plus we have 3 steel gates inside our homes in every passage, plus we lock every single door, plus we have alarm systems - drat! still they want to come and kill us. Sometimes they DO get in - it's not a metaphor - this is true, but use the same principles I'd say. Plus we don't do gardening when alone, so I'd say the moral is, do not play with your coins. stash them safe as possible. Oh plus we hve guns, big guns.

Haaa ha ha ha love you for that! Am going to stock right now for Christmas chowing. Why are they usually made from such bad chocolate? Is there a analogy here for some coins? ;)

HEY, when did you touch a bitcoin? what does it feel like? Great I bet. Got very nervous with that $900 this morn. And kids, quitting a job is not all it's cut out to be. So glad you've made gains! Cheers

Hey kid, (well you did say you were 30 and my son is 31) - well done. You'll go far. I am really rooting for you! please let us know how you're fairing. I think this day you are quite the happy camper! But hang on to them!

Can someone tell me into how many bits these coins will be divided in the end. Surely one would have to call it something, else the maths will become to intricate. You think?

Why the aggression?

What the hell is this guy doing on that foundation? I listened to that foundation's podcast and it seemed awfully American-accented. That to me was worrying. Global surely should mean global representation.
