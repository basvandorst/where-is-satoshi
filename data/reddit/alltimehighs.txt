Rhetorical answer: because long ago Bitcoin was a community project. Now it has become a power/dominance tool from which you can generate wealth. 
Obviously no one is going to share their secrets or tools. 
Next time I visit, I want a Poutinery to have their gravy bubbling over an Antiminer :D

I think he means the ALT run-up needs to cool down. IMHO, when Bitcoin wakes up it's month long consolidation, it will shake the ALT tree.

I agree with you, I don't think that's what the market/community should be. However, whenever anything starts to get attached to wealth, people will find ways to manipulate it towards their own interests.

Quebec has one of the cheapest sources of electricity in Canada! 
Too bad unless you drive a Tesla, it's going to cost you an arm and a leg to move there. Housing is real cheap compared to Ontario though!

Sounds like he's in too heavy in Fiat/BTC, and you're too heavy in ALTs
Gotta be able to win regardless how the market moves
