passport, id and drivers license are the only things gdax accepts.
we're only required to have an ID, you can apply for a passport to travel outside the EU, which costs 50€ or 90€ if you're older than 24. takes two months and you only need to show your ID to apply for it and to collect it.
no idea why we need to pay for it, kind of a dick move tbh..

they want two additional official documents to proof your identity when you're a european citizen.
passport costs 90€ to buy and I don't have a drivers license. gdax can go fuck themselves.

and under european law, where euros are used, it's completely fine to fuck around with your money. some people might not accept it, but banks exchange it for you.

then you're buying from the wrong market place my dude

they questioned 3100 people - out of 82.67 million. call me crazy but that's not really representative.
it's also only 29% and fuck websites that want you to signup so you can read their articles.
I imagine a lot of response were also flawed by unknowing and uninterested "call center agents". 
    what's bitcoin 
    - it's like money but on the internet
    oh okay just like paypal yea I would invest in that 9/10 stars

I just question the results and think it should have been conducted way more times. it's a subject with lots of awesome buzzwords and a lot of superficial knowledge. knowing what it's about requires actual interest and isn't covered by googling for 3 minutes.
surveys like these are done over the phone and call center agents just don't give a shit, period. you have a scale from one to six, one being very good and six being very bad: how well do you know crypto? you answer with "I know a bit about it" like people do in polls cause they're too dumb to understand school note system answers. then the call center agent notes a random number between 2 and 5 because they need to get their interviews/hour quota and they don't care about the quality of the poll as long as it looks correct, they don't care about explaining the rating system again, they just don't want to get shit from their overseers.

maybe we should all take a break from being edgy until the the value of bitcoin stabilizes.
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:06:28
