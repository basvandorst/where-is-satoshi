Penislite? Where can i buy that coin?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:52:55
Naw i was talking with friends, good people
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:45:37
I went out tonight and converted two of my brothers friends. Made sure to tell them that if they dont have a hardware wallet they dont own shit. Also explained the hodl. I feel like a missionary.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:04:44
Sats, love it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:04:09
No shit? Maybe drink a glass of water and go for a walk. Usually helps me drop some heat
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:55:14
They do online sports betting so they are used to having an online account and moving hat in and out of their checking accts. I just said itd be good to move your coin offline eventually.

I agree here. My dads friend has been asking me about it since thxgiving, and he still hasnt opened a coinbase account yet. Talking about etf’s and shit. People are scared of new things but once he gets started the obsession will take hold

This did not age well

Dont use a credit card to fund your investment, but yes.
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:23:49
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:29:25
I guess we're measuring in mBTC now?
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:03:53
Probably just rmc, government crypto with that 18% return
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:07:45
I have actually, you may need to call them. I got fed up and just used my citi cards but had to call them too
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:13:47
The normies are catching on
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:32:48
This guy sucks, political hack.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:12:35
In japan. Fucking clickbait title.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:03:40
Then whats a satoshi?
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:59:06
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:47:03
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:58:55
Yes because you are using usd
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:23:26
If you spend your bitcoin do you have to pay capital gains tax or something? Or is it just sales tax? Or is it fuck-the-government-no-tax?
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:51:44
Man and i felt bad cause i sold my b cash a few weeks ago at 600. Sorry about your loss ��
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:03:44
Dude vancouver doesnt even have uber yet.. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:50:04
I dont understand this. If I get 20 machines in a data center, my math shows i eventually turn a profit even at .07/kwh and paying rent.. it takes a year but year two will be great
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:25:53
Maybe i need to learn more about difficulty increasing. Where would be a good place to read up on that?
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:43:33
Not in US, you need tier 3. Be sure to follow the direction on ID confirmation. If you have glasses, take em off for the picture.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:43:22
I like iost, no ICO and real talent on the team
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:30:59
Cnn, is that you?

Even worse, the inauditable Federal Reserve
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:30:15
Personally i love binance, and if you buy their coin and pay your fees with it you get a 50% discount. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:43:45
So this will be happening until he runs out huh
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:04:24
Oh i thought you meant exchange btc for other coins. Who cares about fiat lol
@_date: 2018-03-04 16:12:11
What do you mean by “bitcoin is a protocol, and thats very important for taxes”? 
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:37:30
Thats a blatant mischaracterization of my comment. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:10:32
This is the lamest mccarthyist shit and you should be embarrassed. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:51:28
Behind a paywall, no thanks
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:41:56
Awww dont get me wrong i love my bitcoin, im just cynical and trolling a bit. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:49:37
It’ll still be around it just wont be worth as much as ethereum.

It’s time to hire a lawyer and send a stern message on letterhead via certified mail. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:25:20
I just bought at 4888. And i'll buy again at 9999
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:54:19
No its reddit as a whole, not just here. Heaven forbid you should admit to liking trump or anything...
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:12:10
Underrated comment
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:25:33
Ahh thank you
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:15:20
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:23:12
You could just say its a theory instead of using the C word.
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:38:43
Yes, a red line for sure. If anything it let’s them know you are serious. The squeaky wheel gets oiled first, am I right?
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:40:21
My actual birthday is today too! Happy bitcoin birthday! 
@_date: 2018-04-14 00:58:47
It may be the only place to find coins soon.. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:13:31
Especially when you’re dealing with the religion of piece(s).
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:42:32
That is literally the exact same case i own
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:46:44

What, like if someone purchased bacon online with tokens that ended up in their hands? Tainted tokens?
