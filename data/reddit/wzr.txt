It could go much lower yet
It was MT.GOX who handles transactions as a third party on other websites, if it really does go, literally the price could role back to what it was this time last year.
The truth is that not leaving your coins in an exchange is also a gamble, you have to pay to withdraw and you could also need to sell them quickly if the price is crashing etc.

I doubt they are significantly overvalued (they probably won't go below $100/BTC) and this shows potential for growth rather than a share in a fully developed company like Apple of Microsoft.

It lost over $400/BTC in a few hours, it was a crash, if this happened to more serious stocks, that would be frikkin huge, much more talked about than the dotcom bubble. Something doesn't have to go to zero so crash, heck if apple stocks declines by 10% that would be a crash.
The only toxic mentality here, is the denial of reality (cough bull-trap cough)

They could ban its use within the United States and possibly (probably) in US-sphere countries, EU, South America, parts of Asia.

You should put all your money into Bitcoin, then use some of that Bitcoin to buy silver and gold from Amagi metals, so you own 70% precious metals and 30% Bitcoin (roughly). Just because Bitcoin *has* performed better than silver or gold, doesn't mean it will continue to do so. I'm not an Amagi rep, but at least that way you are using the Bitcoins as currency which will slightly protect the ones you keep.

I think the point is that the media always says things like

When an online wallet wallet gets passwords leaked, or MT GOX gets ddos'ed and the prices falls to what it was two days before hand. It must be pretty frustrating considering how scared people usually are to try new things when the media prints titles which are borderline lies and this damages the reputation of something many people have put a lot of time, effort and their own personal savings into.

To be fair, anyone who bought in hoping to cashout a week later with thousands of dollars of profit, deserved to get his fingers burned.

A currency which you couldn't use to buy anything would be basically worthless.
I never said Bitcoin would have no value, it's just its value would go back to what it was before you could use it to pay for legal goods.
@_date: 2013-06-07 11:46:16


You mean I should buy something for over £70 which 6 months ago was going for around £10? There isn't all that much holding the current price up.
@_date: 2013-04-05 08:58:16
Er, no because Bitcoin actually has an underlying benefit. People might adopt it to avoid inflation or because it is a better way of paying for goods and services, I'm not promising massive profits but a side effect of increased adoption is the price going up. The most important thing however is that once over half of the  world is using it, it doesn't crash whereas in a pyramid it can't survive (it's mathematically impossible) once over half of the world has bought in, this does not apply to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:47:45
It won't crash to zero, but this is of little comfort to those who bought  at $275.

I am one of these people who has been less head in the clouds with regard to Bitcoin than most but that really is pathetic.

So the comparison is completely invalid.

Bitcoin is well under the radar right now, the US government has just enough of an eye on it and that's fine, it's probably market manipulation.

Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme
The Dollar is not a Ponzi scheme
Neither fulfill the definition of a Ponzi Scheme (stupid word gets thrown around way too much, and wrongly too) however I can understand why someone would be apprehensive about paying you in Bitcoins. If the price crashes, could you claim he paid less than minimum wage? If you used them to avoid tax could he be indicted as well? If he pays you in anything other than Dollars he could be breaking the law.
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:13:25

Bitcoin is still inflationary currently, in fact it is more inflationary than the dollar.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:04:53
The look at the graph argument makes no sense. Look at the  evidence. I do think many of the orthodoxies of speculative trading become self-fulfilling prophecies rather than having a rational reason behind them, if everyone looks at the graphs and concludes that a crash is  imminent based on rapid growth, that is what will happen.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:03:17
"It's a conspiracy"
Christ. People want to see negative news as well so they know to sell if China opts to restrict buying of BTC. What OP actually wants is people to downvote negative news and upvote positive news so that the price of Bitcoin is manipulated upwards to he can take a profit. That is market manipulation in itself.
I mean do you take the same attitude towards people who repeat the mantra that at some point Bitcoin will be worth $1,000,000/BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:04:34
It has everything to do with supply and demand, it has few uses it is valued by people and if the supply were to increase rapidly the price would depreciate. There are pretty looking stones (quartz) which used to be valuable until it turned out to be very plentiful.
@_date: 2013-03-01 16:24:02
This is one of the main reasons why it will never be adopted as a mainstream means of exchange, however it might end up as an inflation-proof investment at some point.

@_date: 2013-05-07 15:26:11
It's traded, most people into it are looking to take a profit...and losses 1/5 of its value in a few hours is significant. I wondered why, sheesh why does this subreddit get so defensive so easily?
@_date: 2013-02-27 16:30:22
Yup, using the wallet is slightly inconvenient but it provided anonymity and let people be on control of their own money. This just seems to weaken the main reasons for using Bitcoin, I hope it's bull.
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:14:01
The major problem now is businesses like Paypal lobbying to ban it, so I would just suggest sending polite emails to businesses which could benefit from accepting Bitcoin payments, to the point where a ban would piss off so many people and crash the economy that the government are forced to tell Paypal to GTFO.

It's best not to think of Bitcoin this way. I recently read some "expert's" analysis of the Bitcoin situation asserted that Bitcoin was a bubble based solely on its recent growth this year. Sure compared with a company if its share evaluation was as insane as the price of Bitcoin, then yes eyebrows would be raised, but this growth follows adoption and interest and in fact in the past month or so it has taken media bashing, ddos at MT.GOX and mass sell offs with only very slight dents to the price which recovered quickly. The actual evidence suggests this is not a bubble.
@_date: 2013-03-19 16:29:01

The whole 51% attack would go against the interests of the mining elite. The Bitcoins themselves wouldn't be worth anything if you were abusing your majority of the hashing power and then diverting them to yourself.

@_date: 2013-04-09 15:58:53
Never said it will get that high, but at the same time it is highly unlikely to fall below $100/BTC unless it is either banned or something supercedes it.
@_date: 2013-03-04 17:17:38
I don't think it's to do with unpopularity, the confirmations take about a quarter of the time that Bitcoin does because of the coding. They're also more commonly mined using the CPU rather than GPU which is double edged sword, since on the one hand it would remain possible to normal users to mine them using their PC's rather than buying a rig but it means that you can't really juice things up as much when the proofs of work become harder.
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:40:18

Neither are necessarily pyramid schemes, in fact some people see Bitcoin as a currency rather than an investment opportunity. Yes if it crashes and dies tomorrow early adopters who sold would have benefited at the expense of those who bought, but the exact same applies to people who buy shares and sell them only for the company to go bust.
Litecoin has enough of a difference from Bitcoin for the two to coexist, although Litecoin fanboys trying to make money by attacking BTC while promoting LTC are becoming tiresome indeed.

@_date: 2013-04-02 13:03:13
The problem is that not giving consideration to potential problems and just acting like excited school girls makes Bitcoin seem less safe rather than more safe. I mean if loads of inexperienced users buy now then sell out because of, say the weekend crash, this could harm BTC's chances of going mainstream. The posts need to consider risks so the dev community can solve any potential issues before they arise and allow increased natural growth, because the potential is absolutely huge.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:01:14

Over the long term I certainly predict an upward trend, but given that the recent spike happened too quickly to be new adopters opening accounts on Mt. Gox so was probably just the early adopters speculating, thinking they'll become Bitcoin gazillionaires when Reddit and wordpress jumped on board; I think you could get away with it.
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:57:14
They are just old people, honestly I've seen so many Wall Street analysts who can't even understand the system itself let alone be expected to make accurate predictions (I'm sorta concerned about what will happen when people actually understand what this is). Fiat is backed by nothing but force, she was so oblivious to how close to the pound her description was unless she didn't hear about countries dropping the gold standard.
Gold isn't backed by anything tangible as much as people think, it has limited use but its only value comes from trust in the thing itself which is where the value in Bitcoin comes from. If people lose all trust in Bitcoin then it will lose all its value, the exact same applies to gold.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:56:36

When doing this point out the advantages of the Bitcoin system rather than how much it has gone up by because that sounds very suspicious. However since it does seem quite novel, make sure they know that it is now a $1,000,000,000 market so it does has some stability.

Bitcoin can rise in value this fast because it is a means of exchange, companies which took years to grow can in a day start to accept them and this creates confidence, so it just is wrong to compare Bitcoin to shares. Dot com was a bunch of investors speculating on a bunch of companies which were mismanaged debt ridden and seen as infallible you can't compare it.

So there are no places where I can give them the money, the other party gives them the bitcoins and they cross them over to make sure nobody gets cheated? Obviously I would be trusting the third party.

This. For a long time Bitcoin had tiny value (a couple of dollars at most) and was used on the Silk Road for buying and selling drugs, it's only gained value because its users managed to persuade big businesses to accept it and if the government makes accepting it illegal, that would be enough to destroy it without having to hunt down individual users.

I don't think the WW2 + The Holocaust was a mistake.
EDIT: Mistake = Not intentional

Approximately 3600 new Bitcoins being mined daily and interest moving away, in the short term Bitcoin is going down.

Get rid of the political affiliation.

That's part of why they are deflationary, once the limit has been mined each Bitcoin lost (as things being equal) drives up the value of the rest and since they can be divided more and more it shouldn't be a problem.

I'm not so keen. It looks gimmicky, I saw a more conservative looking proposed layout which was black with the orange Bitcoin badge which looked professional and nicely tipped its hat to the Austrian School.

First point, Mt. Gox reserve the right to freeze accounts and request the authorities launch an investigation and **if** the speculation that they are getting closer to Wall St. is true this will only become more the case. The second point is that while there are only a limited number of Bitcoins in existence, a Bitcoin has no intrinsic value (unlike a useful metal) and there is nothing theoretically stopping anyone else bringing out a different cryptocurrency. It's good but people get a bit too excited I think.

Or we could wait for the price to fall to its true value, then buy.

Oh dear. Look at how people who used to criticise Paypal now say how great this is and are almost pro-Paypal. Yes I own some Bitcoins, yes I hate Paypal, but consistency guys.

I thought it was a licensing issue.

These are good questions, theoretically if they catch on their value will continue to slowly increase as the users of currency increases. 
However if everyone fled then the price wouldn't necessarily eventually bounce back, because there are lots of limited things which nobody wants which will never gain real value (my pet cat for example).


There are online calculators to test whether or not you can mine profitably (factoring in price of a miner, electricity, price of Bitcoin etc), there are no guarantees, there have been times when the price of Bitcoin was so low that miners were making a loss, but right now people who have been mining with lots of hashing power, seem to have been doing rather well.

That's because deep down you know it's a terrible idea


Christ, there are lots of things which have a hard limit on their supply, it doesn't mean their value will go up because they are not that useful.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:05:29
yup, cheap coins in a months time though

Keep it simple and don't try to sell Bitcoin by talking about the price.
Explain how it is a public ledger like online banking, and works like a bank wire transfer but that it is peer2peer rather than needing a middle man and that it takes minutes rather than days to transfer funds.
Lower transfer fees.
Lets you make transactions to other countries without having to change denomination which usually incurs a charge.
1.5 billion dollar market cap so you can actually buy stuff with it.
Anyone can view the source code so it isn't shady like the media says.

I fail to see how criticising another company makes me part of the Bitcult.
@_date: 2013-04-05 09:11:27
They can rewrite the transaction history i.e. move Bitcoins round arbitrarily.
@_date: 2013-04-06 14:54:36
Why? Companies have overheads, are not fully transparent with shareholders, can be outcompeted by other companies. Bitcoin is a means of exchange. Like I said, Bitcoin is backed by each company which accepts it.
