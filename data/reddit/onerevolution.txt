Why insist on not answering the question?
@_date: 2019-09-24 03:16:34
Which ones apply here, mark?
@_date: 2019-09-24 03:11:33
A lot of computing power, not profitable considering how many other costs there are, I could go on for a little bit.

How can I win anything, if I don't even make enough to cover how much I spent to run the machine? I still have to pay for the energy it takes to run the hardware and it's more than the earnings I'd get mining alone. Please stop.

If it were that easy, you'd be rich from doing it.
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:34:06
But what does this mean for bitcoin? Will it be easier or harder to mine?
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:26:59
Why hasn't a moderator stopped you yet?

Maybe talk to your wife about the large investments you’re making first. Who knows she may have better answers than Reddit, she knows you more.

what is a node, let’s start there...

First, they aren't people. Second, Fear keeps us alive, uncertainty keeps us inquiring. And third, I never said I doubted the capabilities of Bitcoin.

I agree with you 100%, I think that manipulating technology on a quantum scale is just trying to play God. 
I don't a lot of people around me understand though, what can I do so that they understand that faith in technology ultimately just faith in man?
@_date: 2019-09-22 13:11:34
thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:37:57
That's for you to decide.
@_date: 2019-09-24 04:01:56
I believe you. But I said rich from doing it, as in from mining.
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:22:42
Mods! He’s right here.
@_date: 2019-09-24 03:15:52
So what pools do you recommend?
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:26:26
Yeah if by greater pastures you mean a dystopian grassland? Then sure.
@_date: 2019-09-24 03:31:42
TL;DR,  but worth it if you did like me.
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:29:04
The humans behind it are.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:47:06
Very helpful, thanks.
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:30:36
What's FUD?
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:13:35
It’s always wise to buy.
@_date: 2019-09-24 03:37:39
I'm not the confused one here, math in theory is not the same as application. You cannot consider something profitable if the energy it uses costs more to run than it collects.
When a computer is mining for a full node, it uses energy (kW to be exact), someone has to pay for that. This no longer math and has now become physics. You're not worth it.

Mark of the Beast in my opinion and unstoppable at this point.
Centralizing and creating a uniform currency is genius for the one world government regime, think about it.
