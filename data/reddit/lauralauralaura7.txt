Hi again,
Just to confirm, after 1 more day or so, I finally got what I expected. Meaning the actual value at the time of selling, so all went well :)

Thanks for your reply, something to think about.

Hi and thanks for your reply.
I dont think I quite understand this :(
So I sent 1 bitcoin to my exchange 2 days ago and expected 6500 usd sent from them to my bank account.
Right now 1 bitcoin is appr. 5850 usd.
So if 1 bitcoin is for example 5000 usd in 2 days from now and my transactions (that I made 2 days ago) will have to wait 2 more days to be confirmed..... does that then mean, that I will only get 5000 usd sent to my bank account or will I still receive the 6500 usd ??

Thanks a lot for your reply ! :)
So just to make sure I understand it 100% correctly:
A. If I just do absolutely nothing, meaning I just continue my life, just leaving my coins on the Trezor and I don’t need access to them until for example 1 year from now, then I am totally safe ? :)
Another question (regarding the same issue):
B. If the answer to question A is “YES”, then how safe am I, in regards to the actual value of the bitcoins…. I will explain what I mean:
If now it turns out, that segwit2x will be the core bitcoin, then what does it mean for me ?? Meaning will I then also receive the same amount of the new Bitcoin ?  Or will I only have my original Bitcoins, with a potential MUCH MUCH lower dollar value ? Or how is all this ?
Sorry for not understanding this fully and thanks for your help :)

Sorry I forgot to mention, that I of course would require a fee for this :)

Thanks for your fast replys :)
Ok so I will just wait a couple of days.
But the actual Bitcoin value at the time of sending, is still valid, correct ?  Meaning that the value of Bitcoin has dropped from 6500 (2 days ago) to 6000 usd (right now).
So if I for example sent 1 bitcoin 2 days ago, it will still have that value (6500 usd) when the transactions are confirmed, correct ?  If you know what I mean .

I sold my bitcoins to a local exchange and therefore moved my bitcoin from my trezor to the local exchanges public address.
And they immediately sent me a confirmation email.
So I sent them an email today, asking where my money was, because I had not received them on my bank account yet. Then they tell me, that the transaction was still "Unconfirmed".
So you are saying that when the transactions are being verified (hopefully within a couple of days from now), I should recieve the 6500 usd pr coin, which is the value it was at the time of selling ?
For your info, on blockchain.info it says "Unconfirmed Transaction ! - § 5.767.08" and I notice this usd value is changing on this text continously. At the time of selling that text said  "§ 6.500.00"
