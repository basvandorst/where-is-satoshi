I have an issue with relying on 'hub-and-spoke' transactions (e.g. changetip, etc) as a solution to keep small blocks. I would much rather transact directly on Bitcoin's blockchain, rather than send my coins to another entity so I can get access to their internal database. If you don't hold the private keys you don't own the coins. Side chains are another option since you would still control the private keys then, but that brings its own negative aspects to it (much easier to 51% the smaller side chains)
Personally, [I'm all for taking some risks]( Bitcoin is still just a giant experiment, and hard forks will need to happen for some reason in the future.

Order 1: 4 items, only 1 is actually shipped, buyer says all were sent. Purse verifies only one was sent, refunds other 3 items.  
Order 2: 1 item, user buys then says it's confirmed to have been delivered. Check and it's not here, so he insists it is and provides a tracking # showing a delivery for that day to an address on different side of the continent. Goes silent when I call him out on the wrong address.
I may just have bad luck, but I'm going to wait for the refunds then just order directly from amazon for now.

Without watching the vid and just going off the title it seems like Rand Paul just repealed/ended the Patriot Act and it is no longer law.  
I'll just happily believe that.

Note that DM guide is listed in CDN as well, not US. &lt;waiting for it to arrive&gt; :)
I tried to do a  4-piece order and only 1 item showed up. The shipper said all items were sent, but the amazon order disagreed. Gave the shipper the benefit of the doubt and let it sit for another 1.5 weeks or so. Eventually Purse.io staff looked into it and found only 1 item was shipped, and refunded me the BTC in escrow for the unsent items. Apparently only sending one item from a wishlist is a common con, so would recommend doing separate item orders.

Not if it includes a free gift, from my understanding. You can test this by adding another card without a gift to bring it up past the 300/500 limits and see if the discount applies as you would expect.  
I'm including an nvidia card with the gift in my order, but all the other parts total over $500 so the bitcoin promo still applies, the card is just kind of on top of it all.

Also ensure you have a backup of the wallet in another place, e.g. export your keys and copy them to a couple USB drives, or write down the multi-word backup phrase, depending on what the wallet app supports.  
If your phone suddenly explodes and you don't have a backup of the wallet your BTC are gone.

Overstock.com didn't completely shift to bitcoin-only ordering after 50 days of accepting it. We failed; shut it down guys.

Some items don't count towards the total, like items with gifts on them. Eg. my order just over $500 with a video card that included the $150 gamecodes free gift didn't count, so it only did a $75 discount rather than the $150

And yet their bitcoin promotion on the canadian site says it doesn't expire until Sept 1st (bottom): [newegg.ca/bitcoin](

Don't know about recently, but I bought from the canada newegg site during the last labour day sale. Then the bitcoin pay option wasn't until the page after the initial CC/paypal, etc options.

Not sure, I've never run into transactions classified as cash advances - I'll be paying it off right away though, just in case :)

Yep was using that one. Deal definitely still going for Canadian customers as per support chat, but they are having server issues atm.

Country: Canada  
Buy with TD visa - working - 2.9% cc fee  
This blows away the other options I've had for buying btc since I'm not within driving distance of any ATM's.

Perhaps a BATM from [GeneralBytes]( I've been considering getting one, but hard to justify it since I'm sure the area I'm in wouldn't generate much traffic.  
If it is one of those, I've found very little info about owners of them - it seems most of their deployments are in central/eastern europe.

I've used [virwox]( to buy SLL (Linden dollars - Second Life game currency) via credit card/paypal then exchange it for BTC. The site mentions having to login to Second Life to verify your account, but it's not actually required. Have done it 5 times so far without issue - once they did hold a withdrawal for a day until they manually verified it, but they have notes saying they do that for withdrawals sometimes. &lt;shrug&gt; 
You do lose a bit due to slower volume (so prices catch up slower) and the deposit fees-&gt;SLL-&gt;BTC transition, but I'm alright with that since I don't currently qualify to register to an exchange, and I'm too lazy to fix it. 
Plus giving my passport, drivers license, recent bills to prove address, first born, and left testicle in order to buy bitcoin is hilarious.
edit: many typos

If you pay via credit card or paypal your personal information (address, etc) is included in the process, even if the store doesn't have direct access to it ... just the hackers who break into the CC databases every year'ish :p

Maybe you're trying to link a bank account? I haven't tried it in a month or so, but confirming it worked on my Visa then. I've never linked a bank account though - just sign in, Buy, enter CC details. If you have a Visa debit someone else said that doesn't get the $5 cash advance fee - haven't confirmed myself yet

Canada support? Last I saw it wasn't supported.
The [International Support]( page has bad links for the US, Canada and UK entries.

Contacted support an had a chat confirming that they are having problems at the moment. They issued me a $5 gift card for mentioning it, and to try again later today. :)

Looks like it. I would recommend reading [the whitepaper]( by Satoshi which is an easy read of the inner-workings of Bitcoin if it interests you. It outlines the framework of Bitcoin and the original problem it was meant to solve, plus some of the main concerns people have about it like double-spending.

Just checked, and for watch-only wallets in Mycelium once you select Receive to show the QR code it has a big red warning saying you do not have the private key for this address, so you cannot spend the coins.
@_date: 2015-04-23 22:51:07
No other site/info or eta on this?
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:51:31
Add your cold-wallet as a watch-only address on your mobile wallet. This way you have your 'spending' account accessible, and your 'savings' wallet viewable in one place. If your phone is stolen it's impossible to access the savings wallet since the phone doesn't have the private key to control those funds.  
If you wanted all funds in one lump wallet accessible at any time you could just do that ... but it provides a wider attack surface against you. I'd rather have the bulk of my assets that I don't immediately need in safer location.

* order now button links to wordpress themes buy page 
* need pictures of the actual device(s) being offered without having to dig through the site to find them, for the lil'bodega looks like it's just the small gallery icons on its page.
* didn't see this, but assume it's more a vending machine you refill ala vanilla skyhook, and it doesn't sync up to an exchange and re-buy coins after selling from its balance?

Network speed/upload isn't a problem for some places, but it is for others. After 1 day of 200GB upload every ISP in my area (Canada) would be either a) throwing a fit telling you to stop or be disconnected b) gleefully watching the total upload amount then billing thousands in overage fees.
