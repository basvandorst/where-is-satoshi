I believe the limitations to scalability stem from technology, not from the bitcoin protocol. Bandwidth and storage space are the main limiting factors. If it is profitable, then I believe the technology will be developed and can keep up. I don't think we will reach your proposed transaction volume for at least 10 years. Considering we have terabyte hard drives today, I think the technology will grow fast enough. If it's possible at all, this is how it would be achieved I think.

What if bitcoin cash can accommodate just as many transactions without all the added extra complexities of lightning network? A second layer can only be as decentralized as its base layer, so to say lightning network makes bitcoin MORE decentralized doesn't make sense to me.

Shouldn't it be implemented simply because it's beneficial to everyone? Why does it have to be forced?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:22:49
The first reason is Bitcoin went through an unsustainable spike in price in the past few months, driven by greed, fomo, media attention, trading, and speculation. This dip is a price correction after all that mania settled down. 
Bitcoin was below $10,000 at the beginning of December, which means it is still up %20.
The other reason is Bitcoin is no longer useable for small transactions. 2 types of people hold Bitcoin. 1) to hold and and get rich 2) wait for lightning network to enable transactions.
Confidence in these two areas are diminishing and people are moving to other coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:38:52
Then I guess no one will use it and the price is just a bubble. I never said it's useful. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:41:39
This is stupid. If the price only depends on everyone holding you're fucked. Bitcoin isn't about the price but that's all anyone cares about right now. If it's useful then people will use it.

I like to compared the blockchain to the internet. I feel like altcoins are creating different versions of the internet for their own application. However, there's no reason why their application couldn't be ported over to the most secure, reliable, and widely accepted blockchain, just like how there are different web applications running on the same internet.
I think there will be one dominant coin, and altcoins might be used in private applications like how organizations might use a private intranet.

Don't tell her about the BTC. Ask her what she would do if she won the lottery and have a thorough conversation about it. After that, make the decision for yourself about how much you want to reveal to her. DO NOT feel obligated to tell her just because you're married. Money changes people and you seem to be well aware of that. It doesn't mean you don't love her or don't trust her. 
If you can pay off the house in cash, that leaves you with much more disposable income or time on a monthly basis to put to better use. If you stay in a mortgage, 1) your BTC is volatile and 2) you're still committing every month towards the mortgage. Opportunity cost of mortgage is very high IMO. Less stress on your marriage, more time to pursue career opportunities without risk. Your wife can pursue something she enjoys or raise your child better.
Good luck!

I think the solution is to make wallets complex, like constantly changing addresses and splitting the total amount across multiple addresses without the user noticing. 
I don't think keeping bitcoin in one address for long periods was ever the intended use because of the risk you have presented. 
@_date: 2016-09-07 09:52:04
That's true, if all the addresses are managed from one source, they could all be hacked at once through that source.
I'm imagining some sort of wallet-device that can't be accessed by a password. Something more intimate like retina scan or fingerprint scan.

"But who audits the miners?" is a very legitimate question and Joe answered it very well in very simple terms.
Tom's just playing the role of leading the discussion. He takes the point of view of the intended audience (those who don't understand or those who are skeptical), and allows the audience to take his side. The answers Joe gives are very good. If you come out super pro-bitcoin all the haters are just going to immediately dismiss you. They have to appear to be uncertain about bitcoin in order to appear objective, reasonable, and unbiased.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:17:07
Like I said, he's taking sides with the intended audience. He presents these stupid thoughts disguised as a professional opinion so people who actually think this can relate to him. This allows Joe to counter it with reason and the intended audience can actually accept it. You are not the intended audience. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:18:38
Anyone from the Bitcoin space is obviously biased to praise Bitcoin. That's not what their audience wants to see. Anything a "Bitcoiner" says is going to be dismissed as propaganda by a skeptic. Just like how a car salesman is going to tell their car is great. You need a mechanic who isn't associated with the salesman to tell you the car is great. (It's not a perfect analogy I know.)

That's uncalled for. You don't have to identify her this way, as if being female and Indian is the reason for her actions. Maybe her circumstances and environment from being a female Indian lead her down this path but they are still not fair grounds to judge her by. Her actions are enough. Anyways, coders often copy and paste code all the time. Perhaps she went too far in this instance.

He's taking a lot of credit for the value of bitcoin by saying it's the developers who give bitcoin value. It's partially right in that developers of wallets, exchanges, etc... allow more users to use bitcoin, but he also points to the developers of other cryptos and saying how they're doing it wrong. It's the code of the alt-coins that is wrong. It doesn't matter if the developers are good. At the end of the day developers are still people. "Developers are the heart of what bitcoin is" and saying bitcoin has the most and best developers isn't reassuring, especially coming from a developer. Of course you'd say that about yourself.
I feel like this interview is boasting the greatness of the developers working on bitcoin than the bitcoin protocol itself.

I'm kind of concerned as well. Been hodling just before the​ Mt. Gox debacle and it seems like a frenzy right now. All this talk about transaction fees and confirmation times, I don't actually know how useable Bitcoin is right now. I haven't tried recently and I don't understand the fork. I haven't moved my coins yet.

Although I agree with you, he is purposely renaming bch to bitcoin, knowing full well that the majority of people associate the name Bitcoin with btc. I'm not sure if it's worthy of a lawsuit but it's kind of misleading. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 02:50:04
I literally just explained why blocks are not random and yes, it's very basic.
Also in your situation it sounds like RBF is the problem, allowing you to replace your transaction. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:29:27
Even if you are right, lightning network is subject to the same risks. You still need to transact on chain to open/close an LN channel. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:30:51
It's not random at all. Transactions are prioritized first by fee and then time of broadcast. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:45:10
Yes I explained the average, which means the individual values fluctuate. I never said they're exactly 10 minutes. You said confirmation times are random which oversimplified and misleading, quoting times like 30 minutes to 3 in 2 minutes like it's the norm. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:26:52
Why do some blocks take 30 minutes? Block difficulty automatically adjusts to maintain 10 minute blocks depending on network hashing power. Any divergence from this is due to a sudden change in the hash power of the network. It is not random. 
More miners will choose transactions with higher fees to make more profit. That gives the block a higher chance to confirm due to more hashing power. If miners work together to choose transactions due to other motives, that ends up compromising the network and the chain loses its integrity. No one wins. 
Time of broadcast allows the transaction to propagate throughout the network first before later transactions even exist yet. Miners only 'choose' transactions because the mempool is backed up and they can pick ones with higher fees. The mempool creates an opportunity cost for each transaction mined. With an empty mempool, there are no opportunity costs and the first transaction that is broadcasted is put into the next block immediately.

@_date: 2016-07-06 17:51:41
The absolute best possible way is to generate your keys on a computer that never goes online. Store your bitcoins on those public keys.
Once a private key is used even just ONCE to withdraw bitcoin, it becomes traceable by hackers. Just generate a new public key and transfer any remaining bitcoins to the new key. It's not convenient but it's secure.

I made a transfer the other day and it took 24hrs to be confirmed. You could argue that the transfer is irreversible so it doesn't matter, but the BTC is in limbo and the receiver cannot utitilize those BTC until the transfer is confirmed.
The volume of transfers is relatively small. I feel like this could be a problem in the future. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:28:19
Big picture, the earlier you get in the better. Just try to time it so you get in during a small dip.
Exchanges are like gas stations. The prices are generally the same, but their volumes are different and demands are different. That's why the prices are different. There's nothing stopping people from going to one gas station/exchange to another.

Any time you spend wondering if you *should* buy it or not is a waste of time. Decide exactly why you are buying it, and then do it. Don't think about the price. Just think about how much you can afford.

Bitcoin is not an investment. It's a gamble.
There's more to it that just the money. You can learn a lot and it feels great to be involved. You probably won't get rich, but there is obviously potential to make a good return. Think of it in % and not in $.
Or think of it this way. You could lose all $100 (you probably won't lose every penny of it), or you could make some profit.

Regardless of how divisible BTC is, it is possible that a lot of people can't get a hold of any reasonable amount of it. Assuming BTC becomes widespread and is the *only* cryptocurrency used, it's price will be incredibly high, to the point where only miniscule fractions of BTC or even fractions of mBTC will be useful on a daily-basis. Altcoins will help spread this around.

Are you worried the current price will drop? Or if your investment is too small to provide a good return?
If its the first, then it depends if you are willing to lose $200. Chances are, you won't lose them right away, and you won't lose every penny.
If it's the second, the current price has nothing to do with your investment. No one knows how far the price will rise/fall. 100 was mindblowing a few months ago. 600 was mindblowing a week ago. Don't bother thinking about the current price. Whatever you invest, you start at 100%.
