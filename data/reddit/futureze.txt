If you are happy with the risk that’s fine. As someone who has business partners to pay etc accepting crypto in USD value is the only practical option. I agree nice to see BTC stable for now, it will become more stable over time too

Obviously their servers are under heavy load, because they are the biggest exchange, lol. If you don’t like it trade somewhere else it’s a free crypto world. Is it just me? I don’t understand the point of this post

Very revealing when Lee talks about how everyone is happy after big price increases in last 12 months, and Roger says: “I’m not happy I’m pretty mad”.  Roger has more money and coins than 99.9% of people on Earth, yet here he is saying he is angry and upset. I used to hate the guy for endless BCash promotion, now I just feel sorry for him. Some people just need endless drama I suppose and won’t be happy no matter how much money / freedom they have.

If BTC halved in value you’d only get half price for your condo. USD is used as the benchmark for stable value while the transaction takes place with actual crypto, at 99% of crypto merchants!

I agree with this actually, of course it’s your choice, although having crypto accepting partners is awesome. I would rather everything was 100% crypto it will happen soon enough

A simple google will reveal the truth,  he acquired it 1-2 years ago, I can’t remember exactly when it was very controversial as it should be. He makes crypto look so bad so many people think bitcoin is crap because of him. He is responsible for so much of bitcoin’s problems spreading his disinformation and confusion
@_date: 2019-02-07 10:11:35
That’s BS it was bought by Ver Bitcoin Satan 
@_date: 2019-02-07 10:09:31
They are confusing people on purpose because they are cunts that have contributed to the current state of the market spreading disinformation and confusion I hate them so fucking much

When market is going slowly / low volatility people’s predictions reflect that, such as this one showing 2 -3 years of relatively very low volatility. It won’t be this smooth, there’ll be more down and more up for sure though �� Upside usually starts before a block halving too, generally this is probably right except there’ll be more volatility and upswing probably be sooner 
@_date: 2018-11-17 15:43:44
It signals a bear market which we are in. When it starts rising again as a trend, bear market will be over so look out for that
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:54:30
Yes, but if you have invested millions you’ll take time before making the final decision to switch it off, sell up (if you have a buyer) and cut your losses

Hashrate has been trending down since September, that might account for anything in last few days, but not since September! However they are totally crazy and burning money although that is a different issue ��

Oh no his idiotic “let’s shoot the global economy in the foot, because I’m too retarded to perceive that all national economies are now inextricably linked because of globalization and I really want a time machine back to 1950’s America” Trump’s tradewar is also part of this problem, stocks collapsing and crypto collapsing too... I am mostly out for now but I think long term we’ll be OK, sometime before next halving there’ll be another big run, start in 6–12 months probably, but the crypto market is full of manipulation too imo 
@_date: 2018-11-18 10:26:55
Thanks for detailed explanation it’s very helpful! I hope now both BCH forks tank, if what you are saying is true, regardless if it was “smart” monetarily Bitmain and these guys have done so much damage to ordinary crypto investors / the industry it should be a crime. If what you are saying is true they have destroyed so many lives 
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:25:50
Yes it should lag that’s correct. So hashrate going down means we are in a bear market, when it’s trending up it means we are in a bull market (and probably have been for a while before it trends up). This is what the charts signals though, when mining becomes more profitable (price is rising) hashrate goes up, when price has been depressed / dropping for a long time hashrate  goes down
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:47:16
Wow what a genius is this guy!
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:33:18
Smart good long term thinking. Be mentally prepared for up to 12 months of sideways before anything happens though, just in case 
Oh and congrats for owning 1 BTC!
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:45:27
Wow guys these comments make me realize we are near the bottom for real, maybe 3K or so. See you all in the next bull run in 2 years!
@_date: 2018-11-18 07:15:46
Ok I got over enthusiastic there! Trying to account for why some miners with high electricity costs kept thinking market would get better / would become more profitable for them before finally switching off in September. I assume it’s because they thought price would rise / mining would become more profitable again soon, hence taking some time before finally switching off, as BTC average price from May - Sep only had small fluctuations around 6-7.5 K
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:40:42
Feels like we’re all heading into the hole right now, crypto and non-crypto, hope you’re right though, funny pic too!
@_date: 2018-11-17 21:10:33
That is because general sentiment (and most probably mining profitability projections) was that BTC was not going to go any lower, no one thought bear market would last this long and price would keep going down. Only when that started to sink in, did hashing rate drop as people realized mining may be unprofitable. It takes time to deploy / switch off significant hashrate. I don’t think hashrate is the best indicator/ fastest indicator of market sentiment at all. OP asked what it means though, and this is what it means as far as I know. Also means smart money says the bear will probably continue now for quite a while, arguably useful for reaching that conclusion, although the latest dump also signaled that very quickly

Bitcoin ATM, localbitcoins website, trade your work or a product direct for BTC on bitcointalk or another freelance site

I am pretty sure Buffet said to Buy when there’s blood in the streets i.e when everyone else is panic selling, that is when he can buy the undervalued companies at more of a discount, but you are right he also does buy in all market conditions too really. There is no evidence we are at the final bottom, no one can ever call the final bottom for any asset, but if the OP keeps buying over time, he will buy at the bottom too and might make a huge return from that. Of course crypto is risky as f and like I tell everyone never put in more than you can afford to lose. Oh and utilization yes has still been rising this year for BTC with number of active wallets, institutions entering, and now the ETF, it is growing and sometime near next halving the next bull will come most likely, and it’ll be a monster
@_date: 2018-11-18 06:43:37
You think so? Accumulating more when you believe price has bottomed rather than panic selling, is actually the smartest investing that many pros like Buffet etc recommend �� 
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:21:01
I agree, Wright and BCH crowd and co are a cancer on crypto, without them BTC would still be at 10-20K
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:43:11

@_date: 2018-11-18 19:51:10
Yes that as well, Satoshi wanted to remove the politics and power structures from money, and these guys all on huge ego trips and trying to manipulate the market and retain / grow their own power. It is ironic and to me sickening!
@_date: 2018-11-17 15:21:26
I thought the split was bad for crypto generally (made us look childish and immature have you seen Wright’s twitter? Oh my god.), but now I think it’s great. BCH has now split into 2 coins making it worth half as much as before, seems they are both unprofitable to mine and a very real chance they both might die soon or at least become relatively worthless. Love it
@_date: 2018-11-18 06:31:15
This sounds about right thanks for filling in the blanks 
@_date: 2018-11-15 09:07:37
Why? Between these guys, the banks, and whoever else is manipulating BTC behind the scenes to tank it (bank whales trading futures) BTC is being clearly manipulated downwards and destroyed. Without this happening (and the SEC and no one caring it is happening) BTC would be much higher, that is a fact not conjecture
