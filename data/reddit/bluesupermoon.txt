yup actually somebody beat his record last time  
Anonymous donor gives $100M to Canada's largest mental health hospital.. You see i have been watching and supporting Pine on his project and the majority he supports medical projects, teaching kids to read and write,water projects, life extension causes like the SENS research Foundation, gender equality, clinical trials of psychedelics for PTSD and other things that can do good things in this world~

this is cool!

Hi there! very well said. it is so sophisticated. but yeah you are right on that!Thank You. the thing is i noticed in US that it's a lot easier to support with this 501 c 3 structure coz its legitimate in that concept and i think they are exempted in some things in IRS. it still depends on each country. but anyways you mentioned BTRIC is it  ? i checked on it its pretty good especially on the science and discovery addressing its energy and environmental challenges. this is cool!

Hi everyone Check out Pineapple fund at  and follow him in reddit at u/PineappleFund  He donated $1 million to EFF since Dec 13 2017. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:46:30
yeah You are definitely right. I hope that this breakthrough therapy will go global but as we all know the government in any parts of the world is still going to decline depending on the laws... as they are more willing to support tobacco , alcohol industry in  which in my opinion caused more deaths and problem to lot of people combined.My partner used to be in a Marine Corp and he told me stories about the effects of war. They have fought for freedom and I think it's about time to help them out and I completely respect all the US soldiers whether in Air Force, US Marines or Army Aviations, Special Forces!  hoorah!
 but if you even mentioned about the just the word cannabis in my country. (Philippines) you might end up getting killed which i think 80% of the population here are st****d and hypocrisy at its best, 
DUDE! i think they need to try it first and probably they might get enlightened and see the "REALITY". I can can "neither confirm nor deny" just being on the safe side. the Eyes, ears are everywhere lol! and I would really like to thank to those heroes that support these type of programs to make it happen and it will definitely bring impact to peoples lives that it ain't easy to go through these traumas that they have experienced in the past. Thank You Pine for your great kindness for these people that are in need.

hey there, i know how you feel, however i don't know if you have seen his comment 13 days ago that due to 10,000 applications he might get in touch with us until next week and He/she said that we don't need to follow up because i believe that he will get back to you and us. He even mentioned that he haven't emailed his shortlisted applicants. time just flew this month I remember his announcement after the New Years he might extend until end of month but I had a feeling he might extend.. He need to take a break too you see. &gt;
 He is pretty much consistent in replying here personally and I believe in him. I have been watching all his announcements since I found out about his project and gave me a lot of hope and even though I will get turned down it is still ok. it just motivates me even more to continue with my mission.  Let's just give him time because he does his homework really good. I wish he is listening and consider my Organization too. lol!  but Yeah pretty much he made good choices and I am learning too with these big organizations on how i can improve mine and still don't lose hope in helping people with limited resources. don't loose hope mavuno. what is your organization anyway? you can put it here.. i bet he will take a look at it. :)
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:13:51
Hi i actually also applied 1 day before the submission, if its ok can you please send me the links, websites so i can refer it to Mr. Pine? I noticed that there are higher chances for some if its referred by the community. I know that he might reconsider, and he might do another batch. I am still one of the hopefuls but it's ok if i get turned down too. he chose wisely for everyone and he is the best! i wish a lot of people do these for the organizations. take care.

@_date: 2018-01-14 14:25:51
Yes I would Definitely contact you regarding this. I was quite behind on some of our latest technology or maybe i just refused to embrace it. however i pretty much work on this internet world for a living. I need one day to read everything regarding your Organization and it's quite interesting. Hope that Pine will support you guys too!  I don't know if Creative Commons Org applied and i also highly recommend them too! Good luck! I wish you all the best and for the rest of the hopeful applicants here. We all have the same common goal to help people. :)

I prayed to the super blue blood moon awhile ago to make my wish come true and hope that it will come true so i can continue with my mission and that's for real.. It won't happen again in the next 100 years. im serious. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:12:08
I agree both of you u/smoothad and u/Hyperlash  and in fact it's a lot easier for them do to crowdfunding and fundraising if you have the 501 c 3 status in USA. with the country like mine just to establish and register as what they called Foundation it will take $20,000 for you to do that which its really unfair. and most US organizations they have all the resources and the support with the government. I live in the Philippines live here all my life and I am planning to Move to USA but it's hard nowadays so my other options are in Canada, Australia or NZ but going back to Organizations it takes money, dedication passion and time too. I have a startup organization just last year and pretty much i do all the work. living in the 3rd world country is a lot harder to continue with attaining your goal and mission just like our country that is so behind on everything just like my husband said coz he grew up in California almost all his life. I have known a lot of Organizations not just in my country and some orgs in Asia and other countries that's doing good things for their people. some of them got lucky because of some volunteers from other country and it will spread out. but attaining the standards what Organizations in USA  comparing to mine and others are not on the same level.  and it will be hard for these people to fund us because we live in the third world country...its just a statement
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:02:29
another thing to add up on your guys statement, being in a corrupt country with my own countryman that asked for helped like in the Yolanda victims in 2013. We all have the question where the money went? and as a citizen i didn't see some sort of change. and I kinda understand as to why Pine would trust US Organization because of the transparency However all it needs is a chance for us because if you grow and live the way you are at the moment then you would know how it's like as to compare with Organizations from other country and they are well educated, know the possible solutions but still as what i am pointing out that we know more about the areas of the problem and the solution but we need support to make it happen. My country is behind with a lot of things just like 10 decades behind. i am not here to argue but i bet once my countryman find out about this statement they are going to react on this. Just like with expats coming to my country living pretty good life because of their pension from US they think they know better and my country is good but i don't understand why they don't see that their country is really good when it comes to opportunity. the worst thing is these expats are enjoying life here coz they don't want to live a stressful lifestyle back there but if i get to trade i would choose America still. if you lost your job here then you're done, no unemployment benefits, and if you retire then you're done and life is over pretty much unless you establish some business or your financially stable that will support you. I want to change the impression of my countryman as being beggars  and don't do something about how they can change their lives other than crying and complain about it... i understand it completely because of the society and the government. i know it doesn't have something to do with this... but that's what it is. a lot of country need support too... like the countries that get caught up too with war and political issues but we don't need to go further there coz it still the government.
but anyways let's just hope for the best. have a good one.

@_date: 2018-01-30 22:15:05
he wants to stay anonymous and it defeats the purpose if you actually know the person and disclose it anyway? would you guys rather called as "IT" lol!  hey guys check

@_date: 2018-01-30 22:33:07
Hi there yep you're right! it wouldn't matter to Pine anyway. This Person is cool! Pine was pretty much consistent replying to Us on his page... I gotta say "he" is way cool! im serious. He just donated $2 million  to ACLU just yesterday too!

Epic! ��
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:29:53
You are right on that! i think we need to focus on saving our own environment and these animals and other creatures on earth coz we all have role and share this home we live in. Most people focus too much in technology and looking for another planet to possibly live in its gonna be the same as what we have now which is too sad. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:37:50

I am new to reddit i don't know how to actually use this because i'm busy too. i don't know how to post something can i repost the summary you have? i don't know if this message is in public or private message lol!thanks 
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:25:28
Hi guys! need some info here. since most of the well known non profits in USA are i think registered as 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organizations which i think to file for this and eligibility is cheaper than in my country and The initial fund contribution to start a foundation is P1,000,000  --that is around $20,000 in our money in which maybe  less  than 10% of the population can afford it to qualify and to obtain this status which its really crazy. lol! I mean I have met people that do good things to other people but it just difficult because of these things. Is there such thing as getting the 501 c3 status for non-US residents? there's a lot of barriers to be considered as a non profit organization in my country. Thank you guys for any advice. --
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:01:47
The Article was well written, they kept an eye on each donor.. very detailed.. from the beginning and as of time being...  beat me to it!as i follow this journey and will still support Pine after all!   bottom line. Pine is a good man. and the story is not yet over..Thanks Pine for inspiring Us.
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:40:06
another thing out of all the organizations that You donated with i think the best one really touched my heart is the Tennessee River Gorge Trust. You know why? I live in the country side of the Philippines but you are not gonna see it like this and that made me so sad. That is why America and other countries are great because they care about preserving the environment and hands down and no argument about it. I always dream to go to there one day and it will be soon. Thank You Pine for donating to them and For the people who started this before i was even born. THank You for this truly inspiring Mission. this will benefit the future generation and wish that people appreciate it today because we don't know if you can still see and experience the air we breathe and the water we drink someday. thank you Pine for supporting them.
