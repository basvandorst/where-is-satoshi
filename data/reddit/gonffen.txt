That explains why transaction fees increase. The supply demand relationship here is transaction space.
That does not explain why bitcoins valuation would increase. It should decrease because a full mempool means less usability/utility/etc.

If you ask Satoshi, it's an experiment.

Is there some special rule in place here?
Long term capital gains area taxed at 0% for taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets, 20% for those in the top bracket (39.5%), and 15% for everyone else.
Short term gains (holdings held less than one year) are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.

If transaction cost is too high, people will not use Bitcoin.

You wouldn't have a new wallet. Each tip would be a separate input to your transaction though. Each input requires data in the transaction, increasing the transactions size. Not in value, but in bytes. The larger the transaction, the higher the required fee.

You could obviously do deposits by using pre-generated paper wallets ala Casascius Coins. I have no idea how you could do withdrawals, but I can't be the only one who is regularly surprised by what is possible with bitcoin.

Isn't that the case with all modern currencies?

Eh it would be nominal though.

That's a parking meter. :3
But ya I mean, in my world we call that a solar panel.

lol I think you seriously overestimate the power provided by calculator cells.
EDIT: That said, this thing isn't that small. You could probably mount a decent sized panel that paired with an adequately sized battery should work fine. At least in ideal conditions anyways.

How are you the only one bringing this up?
The project is cool, but the headline is definitely deceptive.

Security tokens don't have motors in them... I looked up a random bill acceptor and [and I'm pretty sure it uses more power than a security token.](

Motors can go two directions bro.

I think we've got an issue with semantics here. When I said deposit, I meant deposit cash into the ATM and get bitcoin in exchange. The paper wallets would be loaded prior to being placed into the ATM.
This wouldn't be that different from traditional ATMs. I know it has become commonplace for ATMs to dispense singles, but you still can't get coins.
