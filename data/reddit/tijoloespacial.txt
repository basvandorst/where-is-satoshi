If they do plan to cut fiat wires to Bitcoin, then why are they also buying Bitcoin?

A rules based trading bot cant learn. A machine learning based kind of can.

That would be like 8 months working on minimum wage and spending nothing in brazil

For around 6.000 reais or 1500 euros.

Please also make possible to extract trajectory data. This kind of data is highly concentrated in few hands and allows multiple applications.

Auxiliary data (such as route choices) for origin destination matrix estimation which usually depends on very expensive field searchs or traffic sensors.  These route choices are usually achieved by user equilbrium procedures which is not the perfect solution. Origin destination matrices  are used for urban planning.
There are some other applications like traffic speed monitoring.
Spatial or temporal anonymization must be aplied but dont restrain the data aplicability. Also, users could monetize their data.

Car centric individual transportation. I got your point. Also, everything is far away when the ideal situation would be by foot or bike etc.

I like that one when people say "that was the last day below 10k"

Exactly. Then you could try again with more limit. Or Just create a new channel. Maybe it would be the better option. The LN network size doesn't matter that much, other graphs/networks characteristics do. Being a small world and even scale free network (hubs, few nodes with lots of channels and lots of nodes with few channels) is more important.

You dont need to know all nodes and edges to make a route. It will problably use a maximum deept limit.

Debt without interest rate? What the actual fork. Also, it has been 2 years since my salary is the same amount of monies, but price of things are higher.

Maybe i will sell half at 150k, but i expect to use it as a currency and not selling into fiat
