interesting i've never used a btc client that needs to download the blockchain. I use paper wallets, and import them to blockchain hotwallet with 2FA and change addresses to further paper wallets.
I find it a lot easier, and a damn sight more mobile.
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:16:50
Wow that is literally infinitely more profitable!

A multipool like Hashcows works well if you're only after BTC payouts, but I found just sticking to mining a coin like Doge is more profitable medium term. I would get ~0.012 BTC per day with Hashcows per Mh/s, but with Doge I was getting ~0.016 BTC equivalent. Also, you frequently have to wait 2-3 days to get the payouts from Hashcows.
Obviously exchange rates vary and all that, but mining doge is more fun IMO.

If you want to do some insider trading you could just announce that withdrawals are suspended, buy a bunch of coins on your own exchange for cheap and sell them on bitstamp for instant profit (since you i.e. mt gox owns the exchange, they can presumably move coins around however they want).
It would be a mighty easy way to get out of whatever hole they are in..

transaction fees are pretty low, i think you would do better to buy as much as you can as soon as you can, rather than save up $500. $40 today may well be $80 worth next week. At the same rate, you might get lucky and buy during a crash and get more than usual.

The first chart is my favourite, since the price was at the exact same spot the month before - a drop from $145 to $122.
How do people this retarded become financial strategists?

While i agree with most of what you said, my main point of difference would be that bitcoin is more like a stock than you think. It's value is largely derived from people's confidence in it as a currency, and therefore subject to the same problems as companies that face scandals and bad press.
Conversely, it's also subject to hype-induced unsustainable growth - this growth makes investors jittery when they see other investors start to take their huge profits. They don't want to get left out of the profit orgy, so they begin to sell. What follows is an exponential selling off rate, much the same as the exponential buy in rate.
Bitcoin is much more of a market than you make it out to be.
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:07:09
haha what.
how did you get get coins, did you mine them? If so, guess what - right now they have value because other people want to buy them. If no one is selling coins (trading), do you expect everyone to mine for their coins?
Get real, it's an economic ecosystem. If you want to get angry at something, get angry at the fact that there are credit default swaps in bitcoin.

so your prediction is that the price will either go up, or down.

If you just want to store some btc:
1. Go to bitaddress.org and print off 2 copies of a wallet (this is cold storage)
2. Buy some bitcoin from localbitcoins.org or coinbase or coinjar.io
3. Transfer your purchased bitcoins to your cold wallet address
4. Keep the two copies of your cold wallet in separate secure locations.

"The dollars... are being reinvested into computational power."
What a bizarre and awkward quote to use for the breakout
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:24:42
coinjar is great, but they are taking forever to verify my identity which means i am locked in to $500 a day limit, which will soon not even cover 1 btc. 
I wish they would hurry their asses up.

just buy 30mBTC, they are still less than 50c each. Bargain IMO.

While I agree, I think full workforce automation is a lot further off than my own lifetime. Not because of technology, but economics. 
Anyway, it sounds cliche, but I do enjoy my job to a degree. The part I hate about it is the fixed 9-5 paradigm that is still overwhelmingly prevalent. I feel it's quite antiquated by now and really impacts your feelings of autonomy and freedom.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:49:45
it takes upward of 3 months (reportedly) to get fiat out of mt gox, which devalues it as a currency. The effect is that people take their bitcoins and sell them on bitstamp for fiat - flooding bitstamp with undervalued coins

is this at Bitcoiniacs?
