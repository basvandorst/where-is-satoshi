Ok I got your point. I will research more about that particular situation. 
Thanks a lot for the feedback!

Noted. Thanks for the info.

If you go back 25 years ago and try to explain what the "Internet" is to an average Joe it would be essentially the same. Back then BBS, Gopher, IRC, etc. seemed like black magic to common guys.
It's just matter of time to let the technology mature enough.
For the moment, tech savvy's and geeks (like us) should take care of protection measures like these, while we still are in the wild west stage.

You are right, but still encrypted with TrueCrypt.
Cold storage only applies to the USB sticks I guess.

* I have a mental map to remember them all, and more obviously I won't explain it here, but actually I use between 30-40 different passwords.
* Good point, I do make a backup after every transaction. It is a routine that I force myself to do.

As noted by out beloved troll XxStoudemire1xX, it is too risky at this time, I suppose I will lose the money. I can't imagine explaining the whole procedure to my mom or gf.

Just say "OK Google: Show me the price of Bitcoin"

I backup the encrypted TC file in:
  1. Another USB Stick
  2. Cloud storage service
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:08:17
can you elaborate more?
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:10:34
I have the TC file encrypted (4096 bits), and Two-Factor auth enabled in Dropbox. Would that be secure enough?

Gracias, ahora me uno y te agrego, saludos!

Good point, I'm planning to print paper bitcoins as well.
And the TC key is, of course, stored in my mind only :)
