Just wondering, if the blockchain won't be congested and on-chain transactions will be relatively cheap, will mining still be viable when the block reward dries up? There might be a delicate balance between on-chain transaction cost and mining viability...

1) The 21 million cap and its emission schedule is built into the protocol. The bitcoins are "emitted" as rewards to miners that mine the blocks. After 21 million bitcoins have been mined, miners will no longer get any *fixed* block rewards, but they will still get fees for including transactions in the blocks. This should, in theory, motivate them to keep mining.
2) The 21 million cap can, in principle, be changed. But, it doesn't really matter if it is supported by 51% or 49% of the network. What really matters is whether the support is nearly unanimous or not. If the support is not unanimous, it will lead to the chan forking into two: one where 21m limit is preserved, and one where it is changed. Presumbly, the chain with the majority support will get to keep the name *Bitcoin*, although it will be contentious if the support is near the 50% level. We have seen something similar recently with the fork that lead to the new BCH chain, which had a lot less than 50% support, and still tried to contend (unsuccessfully) the original *Bitcoin* brand.

I don't know much about MMM, but I googled it and it doesn't look like your typical scam. For example, they explicitly warn everyone -
 
"There are no rules. In principle! The only rule is no rules. At all! Even if you follow all of the instructions, you still may "lose". "Win" might not be paid. Without any reasons or explanations."

I think the essence of the joke is in that the banks do not literally take your money, but devalue the money you have by continuously printing more money, through quantitative easing etc., so if you just keep $100 in your account for X years, it will lose value by having less purchasing power.

I don't think it would be good to start earlier, because the price behaviour was indistinguishable from chaotic. At least in the last 2 years the price exhibited a more-or-less consistent pattern that could be modelled.
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:43:17
We don't know where the point of inflection will be, and there are yet no signs of it.
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:23:18
Price behaves chaotically, while hash power appears quite deterministic.
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:19:45
The hash power does not correlate too strongly with the price. For example, the price crashed somewhat since December, but the hash power showed no sign of the same.

To me, it shows miners do not hesitate investing in mining and upping their hash power. I saw the figure somewhere that the current price of 1 BTC is close to what it costs to mine it in electricity. So margins on mining are quite thin. And yet the hash power growth is not slowing down. It is almost as if miners have a strong belief in bitcoin success and are prepared to mine at a loss, in anticipation of a moon in the future.
EDIT: whether the forecast will play out is a question in itself, but the current growth rate is impressive, despite the recent bubble pop and everything.
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:37:14
Sorry for this blunder (was mistakenly looking at the log-transformed relationship when I was posting it), I have edited the post. The non-linear model is *exp(-110.06) x Day^17.1*
@_date: 2016-12-14 13:51:49
Nothing. As someone has put it, all statistical models are wrong, but some are useful. Models/forecasts of financial markets are notoriously unreliable, so all of this has to be taken with a big pinch of salt.
Edit: apparently [George Box]( said it.
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:45:10
The model is **exp(-110.06)*Day^17.1**, where *Day* is the day number beginning at 3-Jan-2009 = Day 1.
The model explains 96.4% of the variation in hash rate so far, which is a very solid fit.

@_date: 2018-06-09 16:39:33
Oh, it will certainly not go on forever. Noone is doubting that. It is has just been going on since 2009... so continuation from now, middle of 2018, until at least the end of 2018 is kind of likely.
I should have made clear this kind of extrapolation is to be taken with a pinch of salt, but it is interesting to contemplate...
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:34:02
It is impossible, as there is an infinity of sigmoid curves that could fit the existing data prior to the inflection point. Basically, sigmoid curve is of course likely, but we don't know when the inflection will happen and we cannot determine it yet as the current data shows no signs of it.

Each BTC is divisible into 100 million smaller units called Satoshis. So, to re-phrase your question: is 21 trillion Satoshis enough? Yes, probably for awhile. If we find we need mote divisibility in the future, thes can be done via a protocol upgrade.
