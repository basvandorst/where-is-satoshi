A thought: the rapid conversion of this quantity of BTC to fiat will almost certainly affect the price. In order to preserve the value of the donated BTC, is there a schedule for distributing them to the approved organizations? Also, everyone else needs to do their part for these charities and continue to hodl or participate by buying more.
Edit: Then again, maybe not. 24 hour volume on coinmarketcap shows &gt;800,000 BTC today. This donation would be &lt;1% of that. Carry on and ignore!

I did actually look at the app. Clicking "receive" defaults to BCH which may be confusing to newcomers expecting to be using a BTC app as this whole post presents. For that reason I'll jump on this bandwagon with a clear conscience. Btw BTC is technically a commodity and because it's wildly deflationary and volatile, it doesn't really make sense to treat as a currency to exchange for goods and services. Not any time soon at least.

Pretty simple to protect others from this app and stay safe yourself ... 
. Download the app
. Skip all registration steps
. Double check that the app has no permissions (none requested in current version as of 11.20.17)
. Leave 1 star review
. Flag as inappropriate in App Store or Google Play (copycat or impersonation option in GP seems applicable)
If the rating falls enough, even unwary newcomers won't go for it.

That might be true if it's like a Hydra that just sprouts more heads when one is killed, but shouldn't a forced take-down blacklist a dev for future contributions to the store? That might make it more difficult for things originating from bitcoin.com domains to make it through at all. Not sure if low ratings or reports are best for a lasting impact.
