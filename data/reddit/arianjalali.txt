six of one, really.. our CIA orchestrated a coup and helped install a shah, dramatically disrupting Iranian state of affairs. perhaps we should be directly comparing the US government with the Russians

It‘s unfortunate that big-wigs alwaysss magnify the “bad actors” using BTC, or other cryptos, for nefarious purposes.. it’s a double standard! That is an inherent issue present within all currency systems. Politicians have just been biding their time, trying to figure out how they can best regulate this new class of digital assets. Facebook’s involvement seems to be catalyzing the process, though..

You should read the book American Kingpin, in case you haven't. It's a glorious retelling of the entire story that I've found to be so fascinating

Regarding the Cybertruck's aerodynamics: a drag coefficient as low as .30 might be achieved, which would be outstanding for its vehicle class.

if one said the memblock was *full* from November-December, then what would that make it right now? is it still full? a few thousand transactions is nothing when they are confirming within minutes, and fees are back down to pocket change
