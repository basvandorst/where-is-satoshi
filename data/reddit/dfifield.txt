Ye it is a good way to invest now as it will go only up in some close days.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:00:00
It should be illegal to use bitcoin name in other coins that are not related to bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:27:00
ahahah , poor guy a few more millions to count.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:09:20

@_date: 2018-01-30 18:07:15
Possibly fake accounts.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:46:56

That is true.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:01:49
50?? It's a bit to much no ?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:24:57
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:12:01

@_date: 2018-01-07 20:34:31
Some people out there doing the right thing.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:17:33
Well lets not forget bitcoin was 20k.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:31:44

Is this the creator of Sponge Bob?
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:25:13
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:22:32
That is a real bubble.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:13:47
Well ye if you live in USA.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:34:09
Whats the point to make the same movie.
Its the same history nothing new.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:29:54
They all in panic, for goodness sake, breathe,Bitcoin will rise up in short time.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:00:43
No risks , no money.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:49:37
I saw anything that would accept bitcoin in Miami as well, i think was homes for rent.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:41:38
Sounds fake
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:13:55
Find other partner. But with jokes aside try to find a group that have same passion as you.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:28:45
Well we just need to hold right now it will be going up soon.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:22:42
Yes, a video could be int interesting.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:37:07
That is a nice billboard.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:40:10
Well that is something it gives us a sign there is being done a lot of transaction in India.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:57:20
Not all, a few currencies already have their own plan to grow like ETH and EOS...
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:29:47
Well that is not good.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:18:29
Thanks for this information it will be really good for people that want to learn more about bitcoin in general.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:17:55
Are they trying to kill BTC???! Scare of the future i guess. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:16:27
Good analogy.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:41:20
So we are being fooled? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:14:08
Not only bitcoin as any other crypto such as EOS is looking awesome to buy right now!
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:16:43
Nice story must be nice to wake up and see you are a millionaire.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:09:19
Hope man have hope!!
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:37:31
Thanks for this video. It is cool.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:28:45
That sucks for India.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:29:17
Draft or not it's a start.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:41:34
If anyone thinks bitcoin is a bubble just buy EOS.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:10:55
That is a lot of money being donated but if it is for good cause its good.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:21:37
Well everything is going up now that is nice.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:24:37
Where is all other cryptos they need to list them all.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:08:42
Maybe they have so many people and can't control everyone? The thing is they have so much costumers that maybe be not enough people working for them.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:45:58
Well bitcoin is being talked everywhere that is not a surprise.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:00:07
Nice some good news for the crypto world.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:33:04
Well its pretty possible but people is now panic selling it will go up for sure.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:59:04
Well now you can invest in other coins such as EOS that will go up when they launch its product, it is coming close.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:58:19
Ye I also buy in not long ago. Got some EOS tho not btc and also some ETH.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:37:14
Nice work dude, it's cool.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:09:52
Hope not reach 5k.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:13:40
LOL. 
Times of desperation call for desperate measures.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:49:58
Its fine we will go up soon do not worry.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:01:49
Do not panic it will be going up soon its just a dip a little bit longer than others.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:28:40
That is only one month time that is nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:33:51
That is a country believing in crypto right there.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:02:04
Looks good.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:24:11
Oh wow that is a big one.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:25:00
Everyone  is starting to shake,be safe, this is going to be a troubled trip.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:22:17
Its a start, good luck to you.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:03:46
Lol he was a noob as all are when they start.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:59:35
Exactly just chill and look at the long term of the things.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:27:31
Where did you get the info? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:57:55
I really hope he does it.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:29:13
And that is what I call profit.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:11:37
Debt to who?
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:50:33
Well it has been going like that for some time right now.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:22:34
ahahahha so true. At first no one was paying attention and now everyone is going after the same.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:56:21
I mean, 50k it's a lot money...a lot of profit.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:14:57
I hope so but things look pretty rough right now but the market cap can still go 3x or even 5x.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:49:26
Well time will show on how it will work.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:57:28
Coming soon..
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:15:53
Thanks god!! Facebook it was a good way to fool people.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:53:11
Its a meme from a world war photo.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:04:26
Haha that is actually sick lol.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:56:43
That is good news for sure.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:23:50
That is a good tactic indeed.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:10:06
Well bitcoin has been going up this last days.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:12:36
They know whats up.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:21:44
And they are launching new cards.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:39:49
ahhahaha nice one.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:42:58
Oh nice to see progress on crypto in real world.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:53:47
Please hold for a few more months.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:31:27
Less users now and better tech getting updated.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:48:04
Well that is a lot of money tho.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:34:49
Are not they losing money by doing this ?
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:26:41
Haha, use that everywhere on each paper.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:15:54
Oh I see what you did there.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:52:25
The coins are almost all the same, only those that have more benefits and structure will reach the top.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:12:58
Happy birthday bitcoin :)
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:36:37
Well there is anther reason to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:29:23
Exactly less people using banks better for people but worse for government as they lose control.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:47:51
Ye that is true bitcoin became really popular lately.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:37:06
Best pizzas in the world must be.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:48:46
Wow that is a lot of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:00:44
wow. starting new thinking about the future.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:12:38
Wait did someone lost this paper?
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:49:41
Nice to see bitcoin is helping people out in real world and the crypto currency in general.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:36:39
That is nothing comparing what advertising bitcoin had before.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:38:00
It's look interesting if it's true. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:11:32
I have only heard bad things about kraken idk.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:52:04
More than what this year?
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:30:19
That is actually genial, there won't be safer place than this.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:03:27
Yep I actually use this a lot in real life when talking about investment I always say it is in your hands on what you decide to do when I tell people to invest in to EOS cause it is going to blow up soon after they launch its product.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:05:54
Looks good where you get it from?
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:54:16
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:56:09
This is spectacular for BTC. Good job!
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:05:47
Yep I saw that happening way before.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:25:14
Can I be the grandson ? Goo for EOS grandpa.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:52:48
Lol that means it will go to the moon?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:55:43
Ye I also had a friend telling me the same as John.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:06:50
It's very difficult to see the money running away and doing nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:20:32
Good job man.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:26:24
I think I speak for all when I say that HOLD is the right decision.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:33:14
Subtitles is very useful.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:32:24
Not the first one. Must be one of the lucky ones who picked up the BTC train to the top.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:49:58
Why only 14 year old can make memes?
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:27:59
Or paper wallet will be good as well.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:16:40
That is a lot of money.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:14:11
Thanks for the warning.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:48:42
They should have a part on their site that focus on crypto in general.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:39:51
That is to show us on how the transactions fees of bank are so high. But there is coins like EOS that are working for high amount of transactions with no fees and will come in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:37:01
It will be go up soon do not worry look at the long range of things.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:11:09
Well it is nice to see big people talking good about crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:10:14
How it is declared dead when it is going up.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:13:13
Your wife must be very good at math.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:03:29
You can laugh cause you know but there is people in new york that got fulled by a guy selling cheese tokens as bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:50:52
Oh boy he messed up right there.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:52:31
I think it is steady right now.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:58:13
Don't tell me what to do! But jokes aside ye think before you invest and invest what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:30:21
A way of living ahah
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:55:30
It is going back up so do not worry.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:17:04
Crash it's a strong word, they drop a bit, that is all.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:51:19
Daym man that is unlucky :/, you should check other coin that will be way safer than bitcoin in terms of transactions coins such as EOS.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:07:19
Hope he knows about the fees and transactions time lol. It is getting better tho. Hope in the future he will accept EOS.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:26:38
Here is some of software wallets available right there.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:18:38
Oh lol what a story.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:37:46
You can invest in other coins that are not so popular but will be big in 2018 like EOS and be part of a great community there.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:34:25
Well if you do not have enough money for hardware wallet yes just go for paper wallet as it the second safest method to store your coins, to send from paper wallet to coinbase is easy just put you coinbase address and that is it, paper wallet is just keeping your private key in a paper from instead of keeping a file on your pc.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:33:06
Well ye if the amount is not good enough do not spend your money investing on hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:09:44
Makes me happy to see this happening.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:06:45
You can use desktop wallet and have a good antivirus software to stay protected.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:15:21
You can read here for different wallets and decide your self.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:29:00
Oh wow I actually didn't knew he had such an illegal activity going on.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:29:59
That is why net neutrality is so important for them.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:52:09
I think you need to send one more Hello so they reply, already tested.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:12:05
He must feel bad after that lol.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:01:25
Well we will see what will happen you can not predict the future looking in the past all time.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:18:10
Perfect car for they guy that owns almost trillion of dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:48:45
Going to member this and come back if it is true I will be shocked. You should ask him about EOS prediction as well for 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:40:47
Just hold your coins in a hardware wallet so you feel completely safe about it and have some other things to do that does not involve crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:56:50
Is this all banks doing this or the minority? Did it happen to anyone else?
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:10:54
Well storing your coins on a digital wallet also can be lost so I would suggest you to use hardware wallet all this time as it is the most safe method to store it right now.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:10:32
Paper wallet is basicaly you keep your private key there instead on your pc so hackers can not steal it from you.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:47:14
Do they know about the fees bitcoin is having now?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:41:32
I agree getting a hardware wallet of what coinbase have done recently is almost a must.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:28:27
Hardware wallet is a best place to keep your coins the safest way possible to store your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:21:53
It won't ever hit those numbers even tho it already hited as some guy payed 800$ for high amount of transaction but the things are looking better right now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:32:06
Why is he called cryptocurrency boss lol.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:26:20
Nice, those fees on coinbase are crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:01:45
Having a big amount of your money in cryptos and not having it super secure it's a big risk.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:15:40
Don't tell me what to do.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:17:20
Nice now you can keep your coins safe.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:14:32
Well now we know where he got that money from.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:10:52
You did the good thing sir nice.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:33:19
If you have a good amount of coins I would suggest in to getting a hardware wallet as it is the safest method to store your coins at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:03:37
That is a lot of money, one question why?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:08:48
We all hope that bitcoin goes up and everything will be fine but with this transactions fees and delays is not looking great.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:03:26
Hahaha, you need help cause of the dip just be calm and let it go.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:19
What bitcoin is helping right now is other alts becoming better coins to be used in the future such as EOS that allows fast transactions with no fees.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:03:29
Just use hardware wallet and you will be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:13:54
Oh wow what a heart warming story, sometimes it doesn't need a big think to make a person smile.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:38:10
If they fix its problems it can for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:13:12
Agree also it is the most safe method to keep your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:12:56
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:44:08
We will see what will happen in 2034.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:43:12
Well depends on what amount the person got in their btc if it is a high amount telling them to store it in hardware wallet is not such a bad idea is it is the safest method possible and if your read a simple good you will know on how to do it, if a person is not great technically it is possible that he or he will lose the btc faster saving it in a software wallet than hardware one.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:43:48
There is no free hardware wallet as you need to buy them the free ones will be only the software wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:42:45
With the time everything will be more user friendly.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:54:12
Have you looked at new Ledger Nano S?
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:19:59
That is really possible and not a big deal, look at the 2016 prices no one would guess it would hit 20k.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:38:04
Exactly that can lead to mass miss information.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:52:00
Yep agree, if you want the most security possible you should get hardware wallet indeed.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:21:35
Maybe because he has other things to focus right now than crypto and money.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:06:33
That is interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:02:01
Indeed when I invested in ETH and it became 4x more than it's price that is how I feel.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:15:33
Hey here is a link that may help 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:22:39
Classic mistake. Buy and sell in other day instantly cause panic.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:05:49
Well people should acknowledge this by the number of negative posts.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:18:52
Ayyy that meme.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:19:58
Man I understand that those country's are hard to earn money but scamming is not good those people scam old people as well from Europe that do not understand much about computers and they send like 1k$ to them thinking they will get something from it...
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:17:06
Congrats that is a nice purchase.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:20:27
Depends on how much you have there if you have a little amount you can transfer to other software wallet if you have a big amount I would suggest you to get it to a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:47:14
That is good start nice to see you using hardware wallet clever from you.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:32:20
Agree the fees are crazy high right now and will be with the bitcoin going up like that in price.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:12:14
Oh thanks for the information.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:42:46
Coinbase but there is some fees so be careful the fees are like 3%+-
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:02:34
Moving btc right now takes time no matter where.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:08:51
It is because bitcoin became more popular that LTC and more people that got in to crypto currency only knew bitcoin and invest on it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:30:28
If he got to this point I am sure he is using not even one and couple of hardware wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:07:10
Haha I am glad that someone made this.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:36:53
Hm strange way to sel la car for way less than it is worth.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:05:23
Try other platform where they allow to buy more than $250.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:09:31
Dude having debates about crypto in general is so stressful i don't know why.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:22:58
Oh wow that is a great new years story.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:38:26
What is this humorous article?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:41:04
Ye agree but EOS will be the ETH killer with what is coming up at what it will offer in 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:57:55
Well I think the transaction fees also made people sell their btc for other coin.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:04:51
They also have to not forget the pin that they are given to access the hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:49:19
Ye some banks like to control people money, almost all of them.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:47:49
You made a good decision in to switching to hardware wallet as it is the most secure one.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:02:20
U agree when you have a good amount of cash having a hardware wallet is a must as it offers the best security possible out there a this moment.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:45:29
It is nice to see that bitcoin have helped so many people in this year.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:42:09
No one knows certainly but it seems going up and will be keeping it as I don't think more people will sell so much bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:53:19
Here we go starting a revolution against coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:57:41
Exactly people want to take back what they invested in start but I am sure people will buy more after the new years and price will go up again.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:42:55
Yep the fees are high everywhere right now but there is some places you can find lower fees.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:42:42
Oh wow what a sad story I am glad that advice from people in internet hep you out that is nice to hear.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:25:13
The whole point is that the key never leaves the device (except thru it's LCD screen). If the key comes from an online source, it could've been copied somewhere. Using an online key on the wallet "defeats" the purpose of the hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:35:30
Even tho the explanation wasn't for me I appreciate and thank you for your time.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:00:09
Is it good ye but kinda expensive as well.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:08:28
Hahah, I guess this is what you always say to your family right?
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:45:50
That is pretty possible when dealing with money.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:31:23
Unlucky, in trading you have to do your own research and think before panic.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:15:46
He prob made quite a bank if he is a holder from 2013.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:16:08
Oh wow what a cool present nice.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:49:36
Funny you didn't even think this was possible back then.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:29:14
Oh wow thanks for this guide and your time.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:12:40
Yes exactly to those people that lost money do they still have to pay the taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:52:24
Indeed, just don't panic and be patient.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:33:29
You can look any platform that allows it there is some you just have to research about it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:25:33
Well if your store your keys in your pc next to your hardware wallet it's quite possible.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:58:10
That is true most people use coinbase as it easy in some way to use and allow to trade instantly for other coins.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:34:28
SO wait they did not wanted to accept bitcoin but when they saw prices going back up they start accepting it back?
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:48:30
Is there a possibility to print physical bitcoins right now? I think I saw some vouchers that allow to do that.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:48:11
Ye the media can have big impact on peoples minds.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:08:47
Nice, happy to see you got your btc back :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:09:41
If it will do its job and be most secure yes I would use.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:05:28
Haha nice, I also get surprised when I remember some password that I didn't use for quite some time.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:21:01
Well that is true that is why banks exist but here we are talking of total control of your funds.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:28:28
Depends in which country you are if your country has a law about crypto and money form internet then you have to pay it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:58:06
Just wait after new years.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:12:50
Thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:17:53
Well he was right by 50%.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:43:28
Daym being an US citizen is not easy.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:00:48
Here is some desktop wallets for you to look at 
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:02:15
Well ye I also agree that investing 76$ for store safely 1.6k is worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:40:49
Oh nice find thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:02:48
Nice do not stop over there look always to make more money with cryptos I would suggest you in to looking at EOS it is in token right now but when this coin will be out and it is almost time for it in start of 2018 it will be worth way more than it is right now. It is like garbing free money.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:18:38
Nice to see it is working.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:48:26
Well dividing your coins to keep it in different place is fine but you must to be sure that you do not forget all the access to all those places. Keeping your coins on hadware wallet itself is a really secure method in to holding it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:20:34
The most easy way to explain is cause it is going down but people will buy it so it will go up and be worth more.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:57:18
EOS  will enter the highlight for 2018 for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:51:34
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:06:27
Who have millions in bitcoin I am sure they know on how to keep them safe.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:39:53
They do it not only with bitcoin but with other topics too. I don't know how people can be so ignorant about a topic and discuss it like that.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:07:54
Thanks for the warning.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:13:53
Ye just do not panic and HODL !
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:18:22
Thanks for the guide.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:00:28
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:49:11
Exactly with friendly interface coinbase became really easy to use.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:50:04
Exactly that title is really miss leading.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:41:45
Lol you made me giggle sir.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:16:46
Exactly people think if they made money from this we can too.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:15:30
I knew they were the right people.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:07:33
Well it is quite possible yes that the price will go up.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:56:07
Hm for some reason I can not even open that website so I am not sure how you paper wallet works, but the term paper wallet is from keeping your private key in a paper form so hackers can not steal it from your computer. You still using a digital wallet in the end. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:07:58
Ye a lot of people are having problems with their transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:31:56
Exactly how I see it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:16:43
Well depends if you get it in the lower price on the dip you are wining right now.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:20:55
If you have a lot of it you must use hardware wallet as it is most secure method but is also the most expensive one if not just get a desktop wallet and you should be fine also use a good antivirus.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:12:18
We will see in the start of 2018 what will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:41:32
Agree, if you really want to feel secure use hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:22:16
Never panic when price drop just keep calm and hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:46:41
You are doing right get the password in a paper form and delete it form drop box as if someone gains access to it can gain access to your wallets, you also can get an hardware wallet and always keep it with you.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:47:23
Any hardware wallet will be a good choose to store your coins right now as it is the safest method out there.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:14:16
Why you think bitcoin will destroy you?
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:46:37
Wait he is not even a good guy himself from what I understood. If it is like that. What goes around comes around.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:48:55
Yep agree especial with EOS it will blow in the start of 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:08:18
oh 2010 daym I thought a person with so much bitcoin should know everything about management of those.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:01:30
Nice story, you can cash out from coinbase directly to your bank if your bank allow it or to your paypal account.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:33:52
After its price went up everyone looking at how much money people made and everyone want it right now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:55:03
Thank you for this gift to the community.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:12:23
Not only bitcoin get hat discount price as other coins do it as well coins such as EOS grab while you can boys and girls!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:08:05
Yes that is one of the reasons to hold in crypto is to not pay tax but as it comes more popular government will implant tax to it as well.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:41:25
Well the first rule is do not panic sell it just hold.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:14:44
You can't always look at the past and that means the future will be the same.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:37:24
It is santa for someone indeed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:37:28
Ye so do not worry if you do not trust coinbase send it to other software wallet I don't think people will try to hack you unless you have a malware on your computer already.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:40:50
Thanks for this!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:53:29
Well with those transaction fees and the time it takes that would be the only result. That is quite sad as bitcoin is suffering from this and people that want to make it bigger can't use bitcoin cause of this problems.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:04:28
Well you can wear that and not be a millionaire.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:39:15
That is such a big mistake he had to wait a little bit an he had his money back. What he was thinking I don't get it he only could wait 3 days or what?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:10:33
Yep the one rule is do not panic when dip happens.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:49:12
Oh well there is good amount of people that have no feelings for cyrpto or I mean they have feelings that is a scam and not trusted.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:40:27
I do not see why people hate this thread so much.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:58:53
Well depends on the family you are on.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:04:45
Maybe you got hacked and it wasn't the wallet it self that stole your cash but try to contact the support idk.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:58:13
That would be a nice solution.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:18:32
How people think btc came from wall street lol.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:13:27
For bank it takes 1 to 3 max days for paypal it is instantly.
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:09:37
Who would have thought we'd get here.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:24:41
Strong mind to hold for long time.
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:24:04
Good days.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:42:04
That is a bit impossible.
@_date: 2018-05-06 16:02:41
I think Bitcoin found his price.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:17:28
Exactly all the problem that have been lately are killing bitcoin and make it impossible to use it.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:37:03
This is not the super market. Lol.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:30:29
Great news for Bitcoin , was taken so much time.
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:40:26
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:59:49
Just have to know how to use.
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:39:35
Only one fish on the sea.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:24:49
You should get a better storage for your bitcoin by better I mean more secure. Like a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:25:39
That was only to introduce new people it was lie new years sale.
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:28:27
Bitcoin will be forever the 1 cryptocurrency with success. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:31:19

Let's go people all on sale.
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:43:34
Damn that is a big investment and a good one.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:11:07
Was all a plain, the market of Btc it's well control.
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:42:18

It's your fault to be honest, you have to pay attention when you are moving money,even more now, when are scam in every corner .
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:12:34
It's kinda happen already don't you think.
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:20:31
Well it's one opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:02:48
Well looking go until now, don't think BTC will die.
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:13:41
Another shop with BTC nice.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:35:17
From the point you invest your money on BTC or other cryptocurrency that exist, you are putting your money in risk, you know you can lose all of you money, and no one is pushing you to do it. So you are accepting all risk when you invest in something like this, either it's good things or not.Deal it.
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:34:52
It's better than nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:17:38
Smart one.
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:51:57
Just the first one of many.
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:15:57
Of course , they are afraid .
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:11:48
Oh man, I feel sorry for you.
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:13:03
Not everyone have the courage to get out of the comfort zone, but once you get out , you can be much more. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:11:00
You can't not kill the king.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:18:36
Maybe this will be the 2 train to the top, get ready.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:17:09
This is going to be a headache to resolve.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:00:29
All the banks line up to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:32:01
Not a smart guy.
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:49:05
That is a good thing no?
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:12:36
Why you need a Crypto banking if you wanna your own wallet...
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:23:42
That money will be stuck for a few months.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:13:34
Shouldn't work like this.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:14:00
It's a start, but still a long way to go.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:24:29
Great video, very informative.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:31:25
ebay it's a huge company , if BTC pull off this one, that would be great for them.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:54:08
Great new for BTC never give up.
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:22:07
Or investing on Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:09:57
This reddit have so many false news.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:22:56
Bitcoin it's the king right now.
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:47:59
They can not do much.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:22:05
That's cool.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:40:44
Paypal don't work with Crypto but believe in her.
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:53:01
 Probably.

@_date: 2018-03-09 13:02:38

And a new brand was born Cryptomatoes.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:20:54
I don't understand that much, but I'm pretty sure to do that is very hard to do.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:16:14
Soon? ahahah maybe in 5 years or more.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:16:20
BTC became fashion, since it reached 19k in December.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:15:49
Just fake news probably.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:13:09
Last year was worst then this year, just hold!
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:14:13
Great advance to bitcoin owners.

@_date: 2018-03-10 12:02:57
Don't mess with BTC!!
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:42:34
You move a good amount of money, and you do things like that? you should make sure 1x,2x,5x before doing anything..Try do talk with the support it's the only thing you can do.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:53:25

@_date: 2018-02-12 12:15:23
It's starting rise already.
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:09:09
Like the Government can stop Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:53:54
American? That exist in all over the world.

Wise words this man share.

Well played.
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:32:17
BTC it's what you want it to be.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:11:17
This guy put a bit of hope on the hearts of BTC users.
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:20:51
Lets see what they have to us.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:27:53
So expensive to built a pc for games now...GTX 1080 sooo expensive.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:22:20
2020 to more years to hold easy right.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:34:18
Yh what a dip especially for BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:28:52
Why would be , cryptocurrency is here to help everyone.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:33:47
Like you say on the title "Old" money...What we have today that is old? We are always looking for innovation.
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:50:44
10 it's a long long way on the top.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:37:32
LOL! Not everything that happens is related to BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:26:32
Sad days.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:38:38
No man just no.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:17:41
LOL, rich guy with empty pockets.
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:24:42
A massive increase of users.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:58:19
It's not suppose to be easy, right.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:07:46
Hope so , but it's early, more few years.
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:57:26
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:45:30
I don't like this , more and more regulations at some point what was good on cryptocurrecy will be gone.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:12:56
Buy Bitcoin and be happy in the future.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:23:51
UP UP UP Get up.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:48:30

@_date: 2018-02-08 13:12:26
Of course not...
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:22:55
Mining the news heaters.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:14:37
Once BTC stabilize that people who left the work and live of cryptocurrency will stop make profit.
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:40:41
As every Cryptocurrency .
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:35:50
For those who did not sell it's sad.
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:43:33
Bitcoin it's a risk everyone knows..either for good or bad, at least we got a chance.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:32:31
Good posting, it's good to people who are thinking about investing in cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:00:23
Good news for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:49:51

Good article.
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:12:26
Let them came. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:14:28
Cryptocurrency it's free!!!
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:36:49
No way, BTC is not that big yet! BTC have to provide security and balance currency first.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:22:42
Now we have rules, should I write on google"Rules for Crypto" xD.
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:29:59
Oh nice work its very handy.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:26:20
It's called strategy.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:44:18
That's true more important than BTC it's the blockchain in itself, the future technology.
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:46:26
You mean money...It's normal.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:39:03
Ahhhh we are falling. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:34:33
Was a good opportunity to make money.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:43:12
Why don't we have all the same currency??Bank will lose a lot of money,if bitcoin have a balance market probably would be easy.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:21:00
Greatness achievement of 2017, after December Bitcoin was a massive attraction.
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:37:10
I mean BTC has super popular since December. I hope all country made Cryptocurrency legal.. That would be awesome.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:02:57
He was a great man!
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:09:53
The man of this month.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:31:05
Bitcoin is starting being legal everywhere.
@_date: 2018-03-04 22:31:56
Always aim for better.
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:14:53
Until they get divorced,Bitcoin is worth 20k, what a nice way to hold.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:12:40
Damn Dubai's not kidding around.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:13:41

@_date: 2018-02-13 13:16:58
Very unlikely that happen.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:22:07
Bitcoin will survive don't worry.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:47:51
LOL. Many people lose the opportunity to make profit that is true.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:56:56
It was too good if it was ever to climb.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:20:37
They are here to stay and conquer.
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:58:57
Why banks would hold bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:03:20
9k again, still rising...
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:34:05
Bitcoin it's still alive and can reach 18k or more , so it's not over yet.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:37:35
I think he meant Blockchain itself, and came with BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:23:08
And now everyone want Bitcoin...as a new currency.
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:57:37
Faith on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:02:49
BTC survive until now , now way they will die.
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:04:50
Of course they will.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:06:22
In a few years the sound of coins on your pocket will be gone.
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:04:34
Let them dream a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:07:36
Hold for god sake.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:53:40
Of course if Bitcoin gonna be a real currency , they all going accept.
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:22:18
What she answer ?
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:21:25
That's is not the real problem..the real problem it's not the internet or bitcoin or whatever they gonna say, in the end they have to blame same one...The real guilty it's the human being.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:30:24
They bigger things do..?Join life.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:37:25
If it were easy, then everyone would do it.
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:18:18
It's a nice way to live.
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:19:21
Bitcoin, bank what is difference, the laundering will happen no matter what. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:45:19
Much better performance.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:03:21
ohh but if you see the movie the demon fall into the darkness xD. I'm sure BTC will survive.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:44:53
Most...because we have to many doing the same.But BTC EOS ETH NEO they are here to stay.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:47:32

Congratulation, need .5, more keep the good work
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:50:45

@_date: 2018-02-11 11:54:58
Bitcoin will rise again.
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:57:50
Bitcoin is pretty solid right now.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:43:09
This Government is always the same thing...
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:34:29
The safest is the best.
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:15:26
It's a gambling, that is what this is.
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:52:20
Increase all, rich are more rich the poor are more poor.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:32:20
They just need something to blame...
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:04:53
Good improvement, good job.
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:22:59
It's starting to spread Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:10:04
Bitcoin it a job.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:24:57
That can't be good coming from Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:34:08
Cool , end with the scams.

@_date: 2018-02-12 12:38:27
You can study Bitcoin anywhere you want.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:37:11
Blockchain it's the future technology.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:00:47
Maybe in the future, right now i think it's impossible, the valor of bitcoin it's always down and up.
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:07:07
So complex stuff!!
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:31:11
The marking is rising again.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:23:43
It's just a phase on my opinion, the market will rise up at some point.

I don't like when you say "yet".
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:14:26
Way better than January. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:11:09
Ya BTC it's low right now, and seems to me it's starting rise now..So now it's a good time to buy some.
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:53:51

@_date: 2018-02-13 16:22:29
New currency , new way to make fraud.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:17:03
BTC is a investment , if it was so easy everybody could do money easy right...
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:31:51

@_date: 2018-02-17 22:23:01
Some day in the future some one will do a Documentary movie about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:52:37
Looks cool, good analogy.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:19:10

@_date: 2018-02-13 12:56:58
So smart I guess.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:30:10
At some point Bitcoin must stable.
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:03:15

@_date: 2018-02-17 09:42:06
One thing it is true, Bitcoin gonna rise.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:14:14
Wow something go wrong, it's weird they don't answer nothing, probably a inside mistake, and know no one wanna get blame.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:59:55
The stronger will stay, meanwhile the weak ones will panic.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:11:54
He know blockchain it's the future and it came with BTC.

So many prediction... what the point..
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:09:34
Nice bitcoin it's coming for the rest of the world.

@_date: 2018-02-18 22:17:49
How much they are paying?
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:41:29
It's to early to hit 50k, but it's working for it.
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:46:17
If he gets back the money, he will get the amount of Btc corresponding the price when he lost it. But I don't think he will get back.
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:58:47
Something beyond ours selves.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:51:30
And new jobs will appear.

@_date: 2018-02-07 10:16:46

@_date: 2018-02-18 22:13:32
Hell no,Bitcoin was the best thing that happen last years.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:29:46
Blockchain, the number of users, and the advantage she provide to the users,but the valuer of the cryptocurrency it's not something constant , it's full of downs and ups, for some  people is a investment to get money, for other is more than that, is about the future technology "blockchain".
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:08:12
Bcash is dying already.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:36:45
Of course,security first.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:01:01
What a waste of money.
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:12:11
Sound about right.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:54:26
The end of banks system.

@_date: 2018-02-11 00:24:01
It's not impossible. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:29:52
That's true I don't know how we gonna pay with BTC if the market is not constant, the price is always going up and down.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:37:07
No one know that.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:54:10
That's why banks have the option to say no to you...when they know you are a risk..
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:14:10
Probably not, Valentine day have to take care of the woman.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:44:59
Nice probably most people don't know about this, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:09:58
Sure thing future car can travel into the space.
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:43:19
Wow 90&amp; its a lot.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:27:48
Record its the time you spend to press f5.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:21:48
Bitcoin is everywhere,spreading so fast.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:07:25
Hope and perspective continues to grow I see.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:58:07
Most banker are against crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:22:32
Agree, I guess money move the world.
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:54:52
Still long way to go, but if you look back, you can't see the start that is a good sine.
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:30:57
Good investment.
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:12:40
Coinbase it is cool , but have a lot to improve.
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:32:01
Look at that, drop to 5k and now is 9k.
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:04:20
It's may start be balance market.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:38:27
Like the whole market, I personally am anxious to see where Eos stops.
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:58:35
Nah,It's to late to invest in BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:36:19
Hey if you get money, you follow.
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:43:03
Quite big.
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:28:15
Wow that is something from another level.
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:52:59
Lol it is quite bad.. if you are investor , it is because you believe on the project.. More then 50&amp; don't believe on BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:59:18
Now you just need to HOLD, and pray to rise again.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:40:38
Almost there, keep rising please.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:17:39
But the problem is that BTC already grow immense which indicates that the probability of growing back is small which in turn causes the profit to have the same destination. I prefer to invest in EOS that are currently growing rapidly.
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:32:27
You have to try if you wanna rewards.
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:27:46
It's a bad time for all market.
