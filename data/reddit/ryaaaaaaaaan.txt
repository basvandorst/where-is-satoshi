But fees, right?
For the internet a fee free currency is for sure the better choice. I won't tell the names now, but you know the coins I assume :)
Furthermore, a none profit organization would be way more suitable to controll the protocol than a private company. And IBM in the background has for sure unique interests.

Same holds true for money or e.g. gold.
If nobody wants to give you something for it than you can just sit on it. 
Now you could say gold is useful in some industries, but if they also don't want to give you something for it, you're also screwed. 
Your argument fits to everything that's just meant to be exchanged but not being used by itself.
Question: What do you do if you already own a palace but have money to buy many more. So they are all not worthless but you cannot live in every palace. I think owning lots of palaces doesn't make you happy. But then it gets philosophical...

In one word: Yes, it could.
Shit, that were three.

Difficult... US market is kinda overvalued currently. Check the Shiller ratio.

For p2p credits, there is usually also a middle man. There is someone who collects money on platforms like mintos and offer a credit. You don't really give money directly to a person. In that case it would be problematic if the person refuses to pay back.

We have to put it into relation to how many people invest in the stock market, which is way less risky. I don't think we will hit the same number with crypto.

Lykke exchange: No fees for trading. No fees when using wired transfer. Only fees when using credit card.

True story. But also here we can never be sure that history repeats. Of course poor people need to pull out money. But there has never been more money invested in speculative markets than nowadays and this is also done by e.g. retirement fonds which won't pull out.
So it could be that the pull out effect is weakened by institutions.
Furthermore, bitcoin might be used in future bear markets as a hedge by larger investors. We just don't know.
Sadly my gut tells me the same as you said for 2019 and nobody should underestimate GUT POWER.... Hell yeah!!!
