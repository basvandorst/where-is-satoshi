**I want to make my reply short**
I'm arguing gold is a better and more favored investment than bitcoin.
Current governments will be in place for many more generations, and I'm interested in bitcoins ability to compete with bankers. Have them back down from their current stance on policy, to succumb to competition pressures. This is what made me buy bitcoin. Furthering the inevitable subvert of their system. (managing interest rates)
The intrinsic value of gold is on the basis that it doesn't tarnish, it's conductive, rare, will continue to be rare.
How is the bitcoin network dissimilar from torrents? They're becoming less popular, I understand how it's used for illegal downloading, but is it fair to factor in the possible taxes, regulations to be placed on BitCoin? Similar to those being used to try to weaken Uber?
My presumption is that bitcoin will gain a fair price and be a fair place holder until a rally against bitcoin starts.
The reason why I brought up Peter's background is that this thread is based on his criticism. His usual line of reasoning would end with him supporting alternatives to FIAT, but also bearish keeping in mind limitations specifically towards the perception of its destined future. Why wouldn't govn't consider ways of balancing out competition?

I'll admit I'm wrong. Very excited at the optimism as I'm willing to be invested in bitcoin for hobby's sake. I don't have interest in gold, but his predictions have been valid from the podcasts I've followed after me getting into bitcoin.
