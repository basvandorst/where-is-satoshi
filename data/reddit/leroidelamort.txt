I would like to say the question could be asked in regards to stocks. But BTC has not only a fixed supply unlike the U.S dollar it also is a new technology similar to how Facebook was revolutionary in the world of social networking. Bitcoin is a revolution in finance and as such our way of thinking about it in terms of contemporary currencies are slightly wrong. 
While it is related to the dollar it can be used as a store of value similar to a house, a currency similar to the CAD, an investment like a stock, and in reference to ether and crypto in general it can be used to create other use cases where it can be utilized. 
It’s like a stock and a fiat currency had a baby and that baby is BTC to put it simply. And that baby still has to fully mature that’s why everyone who is interested in bitcoin who aren’t too interested in the technological aspects tend to expect higher gains at the price than anything else and seeing as price is a result of demand and the demand for crypto hasn’t  quit reached its peak or at least a new peak compared to winter 2017.  Many can say with confidence that the price will go up mainly because overall we really haven’t fully developed BTC or our understanding of it in 10 years I’d be truly surprised if this technology feels and works exactly the same as it does now, maybe by then we’ll be wondering if a million dollar bitcoin is too cheap or if a 5 dollar bitcoin is even worth selling. It can all go either way depending on time and public opinion. Think Facebook vs MySpace when MySpace was in its prime I doubt anyone would think Facebook would become the multi-billion dollar juggernaut it became and I’m sure plenty thought it’s original stock price wasn’t worth it.  But alas value is all a matter of perspective. 
At least that’s my opinion on the price. Maybe it’s expensive maybe it’s cheap time will definitely tell.   Cheers.
