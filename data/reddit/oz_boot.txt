Do you have any updates on this? Curious to know their reasoning and the outcome if any.

I imagine they are using P2Pool, otherwise it requires an account on multipool etc, meaning they could get traced. Least with P2Pool it pays out directly to your address and doesnt require an account and password

Come to LTC Rabbit. A multipool that pays out in LTC but the last week or so has been only mining LTC and payout is much much better than P2Pool.
P2Pool wasnt working for me, for 2 days i got .14 payout. When i was mining with 900kh/s i was getting .11 payout. Now I have 1.8 and only getting .01

I would be shopping around to other banks or credit unions and make sure they are well aware of the type of business you are. Do not just deal with a bank manager. Be a little proactive and contact their fraud department 1st to work out what the red flags are and work with them. The more forth coming you are and even if it requires you to do some of their work, it may go towards building BTC's reputation with Australian banks

Yup, platter HDD however it is separate to the OS SSD.
This will be come a massive hindrance to the network, the network has been active for 7 years, what's is it going to look like in another few years? How are vendors supposed to handle this when adopting Bitcoin to transact?
There needs to be a seamless, fast option from willingness to adopt a technology to being able to use it. People will opt to not use it if as a small business it takes upwards of a week or 2 depending on the internet connection they have.

No other services like streaming media from this hdd or other wallets are impacted, only Bitcoin and I am assuming it is due to blockchain size.

No, i7 CPU, 8GB ram, SSD OS HDD and a separate HDD for wallets. Bitcoin is the only wallet open though

Whats the point in having them then, limited places to purchase with and worthless if holding.
This is jsut the banks way of dealing with it as they know it will hurt them and expose their system.

Anyone notice the % is out on the pic down the bottom?
I only count 55%
@_date: 2013-06-26 08:27:43
But is that % representing how that million downloads is split between OS's?
