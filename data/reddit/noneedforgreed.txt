Not going to store much value when everybody understands the consensus that it's useless and becoming less functional by the day.

I sold and doubled my money because I no longer believed in bitcoin the way I did years ago. On the way to 1200 I heard nothing from my peers except, get out, it's a Ponzi scheme. I never listened to them because I believed in bitcoin as a currency, a store of value and an pseudo anonymous method of communication. Everyday there was a new store accepting it or new way to use it.
Now there has been two years straight of regression in adoption, civil disputes about forks, major retailers like steam refusing its acceptance, prolonged confirmation times and conspiracies about market manipulation like we all experienced with gox.
I sold and doubled my money. Damn, I'd have easily 50x profit now, but I can't look at it like that. I said I'd sell after college, I stopped believing in it for what it's supposed to be, and now I'm sitting back watching people buy and push others to buy just to get rich. Advocates now push it as a store of value, when that's never been the intention.
Fuck me for saying it, but this is a Ponzi scheme now. I'm the dumb one as long as it's on its way up, and I'll be one of the safe ones when it's on its way back down.

They've got a great reputation. Dealt with them in November and will in the future!

Seems like bits developed to compete with the high volumes of doge tipping occurring on their sub.
 (because 1 doge is worth fractions of a penny).

Credit to an post I saw on the front page.  Thought it belonged here to show accessibility of bitcoin,  new user mistakes,  and how bitcoin and pizza share a symbiotic relationship.

I'm breaking even again since the Canadian dollar crashed.  Using bitcoin as a store of value actually worked.
