If anyone has tried multiple Bitcoin price widgets for Android, which one would you say works best?
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:32:42
If you withdraw to fiat first and then buy the drugs, yes. If buying directly with Bitcoin, then do so in a manner that the coins aren't traced back to you (coin mixers).
@_date: 2019-07-04 02:37:09
I would DCA, but quickly. Like, the entire amount within a week or so.

What Android lightning wallet do you folks recommend? I figure it's better to keep my spending stash in a lightning wallet than Samourai, for the sake of transaction speed.

I got a VERY nice 6.5mm moissainite engagement ring for my girlfriend, and she loved it. Only cost me $2,000 CAD. Just something to think about, moissainite is cheap and almost exactly like a diamond.

Just make an account with a Canadian broker and transfer your crypto there, then withdraw. It's simpler than you may think. Shakepay, Coinberry, Bitbuy, etc. they will all work just fine. Check their KYC requirements, fees, and so on and make an account.

@_date: 2019-02-06 01:05:33
I'm in!
@_date: 2019-02-27 04:53:49
Nope. Since I'm more financially-versed than my girlfriend, she decided to invest a bit into Bitcoin as well since she figured I probably know what I'm doing... do I, though?

At this point, assuming regular electricity costs, is it at all possible for independent miners to make any profit in the current market?
@_date: 2019-02-08 21:49:19
Well let's say someone had zero electricity costs, but only used their computer hardware to mine (a mid-range GPU). Would they even be able to solve any blocks? Or would the odds of that happening be ridiculously low?
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:35:03
Ok but, what did Becky say though?
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:45:51
I use Trezor, my girlfriend uses Ledger. After seeing her set up and use hers, I can comfortably say that I highly prefer Trezor. It is easier and more intuitive to use.

Fun fact: Anysia Bates is a crypto billionaire today.
@_date: 2019-02-02 06:16:28
Yes, you have to buy the device. You can make it yourself because everything about it is open source, but that takes time and technical ability.

How does it work? Do you enter your own wallet address for the ATM to send it to and just pay with debit?
@_date: 2019-04-18 03:04:31
Just use Localbitcoin then if your bank is such a dick. Or better yet, switch banks.
@_date: 2019-04-18 02:53:57
Just to be clear, I did NOT give him permission to do this.

How come hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger don't have flash-drive-like USB "slots" which would allow them to plug directly into a system without a cable? Does that pose an additional security risk? Just curious.

Doesn't Coinbase still charge you some sort of deposit fee for funding your Coinbase Pro account?
@_date: 2019-01-15 04:06:39
Does a lightning node need to be run parallel to a full node, or separate, or either?
@_date: 2019-01-09 08:47:46
I see some people saying that the Ethereum Constantinople fork will cause selloffs across crypto markets, including Bitcoin. I don't really see how they're related. What do you guys think? 
@_date: 2019-01-15 07:48:19
So I don't need to have a full node running in order to be able to operate a lightning node? Huh... 
@_date: 2019-01-15 03:18:44
If Satoshi Nakamoto gets involved in a sex scandal and is forced to resign from Bitcoin, we're all screwed.
@_date: 2019-01-06 07:23:28
I'm using Bitbuy, it's got its downsides but it's better than coinbase and quadriga, which I've tried. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:41:09
I thought so. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:55:49
May I ask how much you're paying in fees for deposits? Is it flat 0.75% on direct btc purchases?
@_date: 2019-01-11 04:41:12
Am I missing something, or does the VanEck application clearly have a better chance than this one? Bitwise claim theirs is different and yet it really isn't.

There's a strategy in there somewhere, we just really need to put our minds to it. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 19:30:50
A few questions:
1. When approximately will you roll out support for other wallets?
2. How do you determine the conversation rate?
3. Where do you take the profit? Fees? Price spread? 
@_date: 2019-01-14 08:42:58
The importance of running your own full node, setting my own up at the moment. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 03:03:14
I had a similar thought. I'm hoping someone may have some technical insight on this.
@_date: 2019-01-22 23:09:35
Thank you for the replies. If I may make a suggestion in regards to your answer for my first question... if you could first implement support for the Electrum wallet and several of the most popular mobile wallets (ex: Samurai), I believe this will make your application much more desirable. Best of luck, looking forward to seeing where this goes.
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:54:44
Could you please explain what you mean by that? 
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:32:41
What do you mean by "I tethered everything"? 
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:29:03
Hey just to clarify, running this will be considered a "full node" right? 
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:17:36
1. A long-term investment, and will be a mode of payment once it's more widely accepted as such.
2. Yes, absolutely.
3. Nope, no stories.
@_date: 2019-01-15 09:04:32
The trick is to accumulate Bitcoin, cash out at the next peak, and then head over to r/wallstreetbets to "multiply" those gains even further. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 07:12:25
It still doesn't have receiving though, does it? 
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:41:44
Don't do this... 
@_date: 2019-01-01 07:07:26
I'm ready! 
@_date: 2019-09-06 06:20:23
I wonder how many times that person checked and re-checked the wallet address.
@_date: 2019-09-05 00:03:08
I would create a new wallet on my Trezor, then use a coin mixer to send the received Bitcoin into there. Then, I would sit on it for at least a year and see what happens. If nothing, then I would assume they are now mine.
@_date: 2019-09-21 19:05:36

I'm here for both, is that really so bad?

Fund exchange account, exchange for Bitcoin, transfer to hardware. This process takes 5-10 minutes, and I never leave funds/coins on the exchange for longer than that.

That says "Mr. Wright made the confirmation. The correspondence is part of the public record." Do you happen to know where to find this correspondence?

@_date: 2018-12-21 04:56:30
Bitcoin is a relatively new, highly-volatile asset. The idea of saying "classic signs", which were gathered from data of well-established assets, is rather nonsensical.

Great meme.

"I hope you're right!", I yell as I sprint-walk to the bank to refinance my mortgage yet again.

What I mean is, what would they gain from taking over more than half of the network? Just that they would mine more than half of all future blocks?
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:46:37
Oh wow, okay thank you for that explanation.
@_date: 2018-12-20 00:22:11

@_date: 2018-12-15 17:33:12
Hell yeah. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 03:57:32
Is there a way to "earn" Bitcoin without mining? Like, handling transactions or something through my home system? Similar methods that don't require powerful hardware?
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:41:37
Oh, I thought it was like 1-2%. That's cool.
@_date: 2018-12-12 04:01:21
When you say "average in until the bottom hits", do you mean buying a little bit every week/month/etc. as the price continues to drop?

I know more about Trezor then Ledger, but I am about 90% sure that yes, the same applies to the Ledger.
And yes, malware, trojans, viruses, etc.
@_date: 2018-12-20 00:09:34
May I ask how you access your Trezor on your mobile? Can you do it through the [wallet.trezor.io]( site? Or do you have to use a separate app?
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:33:56
It seems this exchange does things a little differently, even funding the account isn't the same as others. I've contacted them and I think they have the option of making a temporary address for a coin deposit so my address doesn't need to be listed. Hope that works.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:29:25
I hope Bitcoin can't melt steel beams...

Once Bitcoin hits the limit of 21 million, how do you think the dropping supply will affect its stability and price? By dropping supply, I mean the fact that every day, some of the currency will be lost due to mistakes, death, etc. and cannot be replaced.

Look through many exchanges and you may find one that works well in your situation. Shakepay, Bitbuy, Coinmama, etc.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:08:09
I can't tell whether this is really the start or just a test-push
@_date: 2018-12-21 03:16:47
Thanks for putting a list of these together.
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:38:53
As was previously mentioned in another comment, all transactions are signed inside the device, so the private wallet information is never shown to the system that the device is connected to.
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:55:10
If you never sell, you never pay tax on your profits.
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:01:03
Trezor can be connected to an infected system and still keep your wallet information safe. An external HDD would need heavy multi-layer encryption to say the same about it.
@_date: 2018-12-20 03:07:45
The hardware wallet has a recovery key which can be used to restore your wallet if the device is lost, stolen or broken. It's not super cheap, but one of the best methods for holding cryptocurrency as of today. If you don't need it daily, you can hide it somewhere secure and not carry it around.
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:30:40
If in 2018 someone only bought Bitcoin through an exchange and transferred it offline, does it need to be listed in some way on tax documentation for the year? Does it matter if the value of the Bitcoin investment rose or fell from the time of purchase to the end of the fiscal year? This is all assuming no withdrawals were made, and no purchases were made using the Bitcoin which was purchased.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:18:39
That explains it, I am in Canada. Hope you guys expand this way soon.

I'm insane and I'm proud.
@_date: 2018-12-15 02:52:00
Depress the price to profit on shorting, and then buy low to ride the profits up on the bull run. BTC is volatile, relatively easy to manipulate and almost impossible to kill; so, it is an amazing opportunity for well-funded market manipulators to make money on.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:24:42
What exactly does "acquire more than 50% of the Bitcoin network" imply? 
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:40:00
Drop to 3000, bounce back to break previous resistance, then go up to 6000-8000
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:08:32
Even for those holding a small amount of Bitcoin, is it advisable to transfer holdings to an offline wallet? Is it worth the "miner fees"?
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:55:23
@_date: 2018-12-28 00:24:19
Is there any particular exchange whose price the majority of this sub follow? Or is everyone seeing different prices and thinking everyone else sees the same price as them?

@_date: 2018-12-17 21:21:08

I was gonna use blue but... why doesn't it have lightning receiving? 
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:42:08
Would you mind clarifying for me how you can later transfer the Bitcoin from an offline wallet back to an exchange? I'm unclear on that part.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:03:07
Well, profit doesn't mean converting it to fiat currency. You can use the high-value Bitcoin to buy things you want/need, you can use them to get a fiat currency loan (on something like BlockFi) while keeping ownership of the Bitcoin, etc. More ways to spend Bitcoin are being introduced every day.
