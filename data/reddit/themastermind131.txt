I'm pretty sure it's the same price but coinbase doesn't update it as often as gdax does.

Did anyone record the bitcoinity.org 14k gif if any?

I think what you are referring to is segwit 2x. This hard fork was supposed to happen around last month but it failed. The idea was that since the hf was going to create a new coin, many exchanges offered to "split" the funds on their exchanges. For example, if you had 0.005 btc at the time of the fork, you were credited an equal amount of the new coin.

I don't know which one you saw but there was a definite fake going around. The actual press release from their website has better grammar.

I guess I'm asking should I move my coins over from legacy to Segwit. Is there any reason to do so other than lower TX fees?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:00:15
To be fair I did look at it myself and both have grammar mistakes. It's just that the one on the fake Facebook page was a lot worse than the official statement.

It depends on what fee you payed. Where do you transfer the coins from? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:19:15
Most exchanges don't accept Paypal or any third party finance service. However, you still might be able to use any of those payment methods if you use localbitcoins.com. The only downside is that your buying from individuals which can have a large impact on the price per btc.

Not entirely true as this price includes the coinbase fees for a market buy. Hate to brake it to ya.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:28:20
Same here. Knowing that I will always have a transaction on this date feels great!

From my knowledge, what you entered looks to be an extended public address. This address is used to generate public keys associated with the private key. I don't personally use electrum so I wouldn't know how to obtain a regular address.

If you plan on storing for the long run and /or have invested in a lot, consider a hardware wallet

Moving your coins to a paper wallet means printing both your keys on a piece of paper. That way you have complete control over your BTC. As far as I know you shouldnt keep any coins on exchange websites (Coinbase,GDAX etc.) for very long. [Here's]( a link to create a paper wallet.

If it is that important to you then yes choose either one that is faster. Just remember that the higher the priority, the larger the fee.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:36:39
Considering you can live with just one I'd say at the VERY least 2-3.5 BTC!
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:55:05
It just lets you decide what to do with your coins instead of having a site decide for you. Also as long as you back up your private key on your pw in person, than its the second safest place to store.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:12:47
If you plan on buying any BTC now and/or around the fork be weary as it might take around a week to obtain the funds on some exchange sites. Personally I would wait to buy any until the fork is over.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:06:22
Most of these large buys/sells are an accumulation of others and not just one person.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:08:44
But what if that website goes down/gets hacked? How will you recover those coins? That's why cold wallets are important.

If you plan on hodling then get a hardware wallet. They are the most secure place to store btc. If you can't afford one, consider a paper wallet instead. As for sites to buy from I would recommend either gdax or bitfinex. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:04:16
I use [Bitcoin Ticker Widget](

Last time I checked the average TX fee was around 11-12 dollars. I think you'll be OK. If it gave you an address you can check the number of confirmations with blockchain.info.

Does anyone think that there will be another bear market soon? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:09:05
Most of the time of not all the time you can reuse previous addresses and transactions sent to that address will still show up. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:41:25
I'm not doubting you but I'm just curious, was this directly with bitcoin or did you exchange it?
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:02:08
The weird thing is that I sent some to the second address not in the window and those coins show in the app(unconfirmed). However maybe around 2 hours ago I sent some to the First sc address but those aren't showing up at all even as unconfirmed. Should I be concerned or is this normal?
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:40:31
How would I do this? Does this method keep the same keys but just reprints everything else?
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:35:49
Lets say I have my BTCs in coinbase, should I transfer them to a software wallet or keep them inside of CB?
