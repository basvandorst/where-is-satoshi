I’m sure you’re right – that’s exactly the point I was making, as it applies both ways.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:53:31
The first is the underlying technology, the second is the use case.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:26:06
Yeah exactly, that’s what I meant: if you sell your btc but keep the usd on the exchange you’re still subject to capital gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:28:28
Right of course, didn’t think of that somehow! Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:29:18
Don’t give a shit about the money I put in so don’t really see a point in selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:09:02
Yeah I didn’t claim otherwise. The comparison’s still solid. 
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:18:50
That’s a blatant generalisation both in favour of libertarians and to the detriment of the unemployed. 
I can play this too: I’ve never met a hard-working libertarian.

I see where you’re coming from. The way I see it, though, is that let’s say you bought 1 BTC at $1000, and then bought something for 0,05 BTC ($500) when bitcoin was at $10.000.  The bitcoin that you spend has increased tenfold in purchasing power since you bought it. That, as I understand it, should constitute capital gains, as only 10% of the bitcoin you spend represents your initial investment in that same amount. So 90% of your 0,05 btc purchase should be subject to capital gains. 
I’m from Finland though so we might regard capital gains differently. 
The spending and replacing part I totally agree with.

Well sure but I’d rather pay the premium of not stressing about that. Playing the market is stressful and I’ll be just fine regardless.

He’s arguing that the reason for the selloff is the same in both instances but that the effect on bitcoin’s value is more noticeable because of the differences in liquidity/volume. 
Not really contradictory.

I bought a Ledger Nano S with btc yesterday but it got me thinking... the way I see it that should count as realized capital gains, as should all purchases with bitcoin at the moment. Someone care to correct me? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:50:48
Even if you don’t withdraw you still now possess USD instead of BTC, so yes you’re subject to capital gains.  
@_date: 2019-03-13 14:55:44
Well yes they create it, but every unit created dilutes the value of every other unit, so they’re essentially ”stealing” a fraction from everyone who’s holding the currency in question. 
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:04:52
Nah you’re just completely clueless.
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:07:16
Probably because it makes no damn sense.
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:38:23
Only 21 million people at once can hold a whole bitcoin.

Fascinating take on IOTA there. Will have to reconsider my position.
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:32:40
There are plenty of replies already explaining this in detail; surely you’ve read them?
@_date: 2019-06-03 09:40:10
I did that and now I spend more time than ever on reddit reading the comments with a broken screen.
@_date: 2019-12-10 23:50:38
Yeah that's exactly the point I was making. This post is just as dumb as the assessment of the commenter you responded to.

The effects doctrine has mainly been cited in anti-trust cases (see Cases T-102/96 and C-89/85), which is what it was originally developed for, but it’s a widely accepted extension of the objective territoriality principle and can be applied in e.g. criminal proceedings relating to cybercrime.
On the other hand, of course, this doctrine could hardly be applied against the U.S. by pretty much any country at all, as the U.S. does whatever the hell it wants and doesn’t need to comply with anything.
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:22:20
Like looking at the yearly lows and basing something off of that?
@_date: 2019-04-11 18:26:10
It’s rather effective in action regardless of the countries in question. Don’t pretend you know shit about this.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:21:05
Trust me you’re not getting hate for what you’re doing but for being an overall asshole. I’m just saying tho - more power to ya. 
@_date: 2019-09-01 20:02:33
I hope you’re not serious because that’s not how it works at all...
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:58:30
Plus the end is from 2001: A Space Odyssey. The whole thing's a work of art for sure.

I’m no fan of Peterson but his point about enforced monogamy is completely misrepresented. He’s not suggesting that monogamy should be legally enforced; he’s merely saying that a society where cultural/societal pressures promote monogamy is a more healthy one. It’s still a dubious point but not in any way as malevolent as *de jure* enforced monogamy.
Edit: missed a word
