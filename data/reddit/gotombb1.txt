Why do you care so much?.  A major reason for creating BTC was for anonymity. Also you can't pair fiat currency on binance so they will be reinvested in other coins

I understand why Twitter would do this but you have to be a certain type of stupid to send money to ANYONE and think you get anything back

So 2 things about CME from that link you just sent me. You have to put up a minimum of 5 BTC with them and 2nd they pay you back in USD not BTC. If I was in the UK I could short BTC on Bitmex for any amount and get BTC back on that short

That number is now though right? After the 1 million percent inflation

What is a reddit coin? Is it from reddit?

I agree with you 100%. We need Bitcoin and other cryptos to be used on daily goods and services. The investment will pay off if that happens but the problem is that the people that have bitcoin don't want to spend it cause they chase the dream of 1000% ROI. I have fallen in to that trap also where I would look to spend dollars over BTC so that I still have my bitcoin

I have looked at trends and charts and think the bottom is $3200. Why would you give them to me for 2500 in 2 months? I live in the US where I can't short BTC

If you listen to Tele-Sur funded, propagandist American Abby Martin you would think everything is just fantastic right now in Venezuela. In fact according to her their system of socialism is much, much better than Americas capitalist system

I dont trade stocks but I been in crypto since 2014 and just go with trends. I taught myself by watching and reading, but I dont know the waves and stuff like that

And 1 thing to not forget, they chopped off 5 zeros of the Bolivar over the Summer. I know this is r/Bitcoin but this is another example of why socialism DOES - NOT - WORK!

Me too, I want to see if they can actually use BTC to purchase anything in Venezuela

Where did you get that number of 13% on hand? Is that for a individual bank? 
Reason I asked is it's become very hard to get your money out of banks lately. I seen 2 instances, with 2 different people over the past year where they wanted $30K and $20K, the bank said they needed 3 days for the $30K and had to go to a different branch. 
I said that's crazy that a bank in NYC does not have $30K on hand to give a person out of their account. They will write you a check without hesitating but not cash

They are a socialist country so the government has a lot of control over everything. I was just speaking to a woman who has her 70 year old mother still in Venezuela, she said it is much worse than what we see in the media. Her mother is not in the best of health and traveling would be very tough for her

I dont get it . I am not the least bit of experienced trader. That would be the same as I going in on a short position right now?
