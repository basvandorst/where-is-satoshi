Fees should be relative to the cost of running a node. 
You can still run a node on a raspberry pi if you have unlimited broadband. That is kind of close to zero.
Lightning transactions do not require mining with high maintenance, expensive equipment, nor they compete for limited block space. 
The highest cost might actually be opening and closing a channel wich requires 2 on-chain transactions but I'd expect the total fees to be close to zero if the channel is kept open for long enough.
As adoption increases, relaying millions of *almost free* transactions/second might actually be quite profitable.

The networks of altcoins are not so busy.
If they were, they would probably either hit a 'transaction/second' limit or end up being centralised, without a second layer solution like lightning.

Yeap yeap. [Similarly on android](

Also PaySafe closed for this week.
PayPal does withdraw funds from my visa, with a fee around 11%
Now there's that ATM that opened recently in Athens where you can exchange Euro to BTC. Gonna check that out

You can use any of the 8 adresses. You can name them and use each one of them for a different purpose.


Afaik there is no such feature in electrum.

I just buy from exchanges and send them to my bitcoinqt wallet on my pc. I used a really strong password encrypting my wallet and made backups. Safe.
Edit: A keylogger virus could see my password but i keep my pc clean, until i use some cold storage.

51% is the main danger but i dont think it's such biggie. If i'm correct, the attacker would have to buy something and then his 51% mining power has a good chance of not including the transaction to the blockchain (in order to be able to spend the BTC again). But the transaction will stay bradcasted to the nearest nodes of the network so they will be flagging and banning the malicious node automatically when he tries to double spend.
As for the first and only victim, the seller, better not ship expensive stuff if the transaction is not complete.
Worst case, even if double spend becomes a problem we could switch to Vertcoin (then we would worry about gpu/cpu farms :P).
Anyway, decentralise and we'll be fine :)

Welcome. I was explaining bitcoin to a friend. She downloaded electum wallet on her pc, i sent her some btc and found out that suddently it all seemed simple.

"Bit" is a microBitcoin(uBTC) = 0.000,001 BTC
A shatoshi is 0.000,000,01 BTC

Personally, as a cavalier i would be happy to use a coin with a different algo if we come to the point 51% attack occur. Or maybe we could hard fork a big protocol change. I wish there was something better we could do but at least...
there are safe storage solutions. Takes some research so you dont have to trust sites or banks, but its feasible. Also, new ideas are always welcome around here.
Bitcoin's inflation == Modern money mechanics's inflation? Omg.
@_date: 2014-06-22 00:37:00
51% is the strongest possible attack but even this can not rob everyone by creating new coins. Which banks do every day. 
Cryptocurrencies are an important technological advancement because they make powerfull hierarchical institutions obsolete.
Also i'm a bit careless and personally, after hundrends transactions and dozens of wallets the last two years i lost much more cash, than btc. I just keep them on my pc and phone.
@_date: 2014-06-18 06:37:53
By mistake. If you loose your keys, your btc stay inaccessible foreva.

Funny story, I recently paid 15 Euro to transfer 55 Euro from Ireland to the UK. Just a normal international transfer through e-banking. :O
But yeah, I do get mildly annoyed with Bitcoin wallets that focus way too much on getting the transaction on the next block. 
0.0001 BTC/KB is good enough for me

Did exactly this a few years ago. Downloaded the checksummed bootstrap from a torrent site and the node downloaded the latest blocks only.

Greek here. Banks have extremely low limits for fiat withrowals and international payments.
Also, it got harder to open up new accounts, get loans or interact with banks in any way.
The average Joe, doesn't grasp CCs but technical people have definitely started dipping their toes in crypto by now. Not so much commercially (shops have to pay bills and taxes) but as regards to savings and even profits from mining.
Greek banks are obviously in a lot of trouble and it's only getting worse so for many people, the sum in their bank account feels as solid as an IOU on a paper towel. I really wonder what's going to happen in Eurozone in case banks start going bankrupt... Europeans don't expect anything like this and hopefully I'm wrong but it could get really ugly, really fast.

0-conf and 0-fee are different things.
0-conf means the transaction request has not been included in a block by a miner, so it hasn't happened. Even if you've paid a high fee. That said, if you're the receiver of a low value 0-conf, youcan see the fees and you can assume it'll go through and accept the risk.
0-fee transaction requests could be spam attacks or attempts to scam a receiver accepting 0-conf for goods or services. You can create 0-fee txs, but people's nodes usually won't store them for a long time, if at all and miners won't mine them for 0 profit. That said, a miner could include a 0-fee transaction in a block if they wanted.
I think that many years ago there was the notion that there could be organisations that make 0-fee txs between trusted parties and mine those transactions every now and then but later on mining started becoming more of a specialized tech niche for non ASIC manufacturing companies to be worth to get into.
PS, Mastering Bitcoin is a great read. 
I'd like to get my hands on the rest of Antreas Antonopoulos's books.

B2X took a snapshot of the blockchain when they forked.
For every wallet with BTC, there is an identical wallet with B2X. 
You will already have B2X no matter what. 
The problem is, unlike Bcash, 2X has no replay protection, so no way to transact 2X without loosing your BTC. Exchanges and trezor would not be able to do anything.
I'll just ignore 2X for now. I'll only sell if they ever add replay protection and trezor is able to split the funds.
Edit: typo, wording

[My raspberry pi]( just finished syncing the blockchain.
[Really good guide](
Mind blown by how underutilised the pi's resources are. 
I wasn't even arsed to sync the chain from somewhere else, I was waiting for a week for it to crash but it never happened. 
Props to the Core devs.
