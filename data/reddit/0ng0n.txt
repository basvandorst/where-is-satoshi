42 people own more wealth than the 3.7b poorest in the world. This isn’t a Bitcoin problem.

What makes Bitcoin immutable when miners can easily create coalitions that amount to &gt; than 51% hash rate?

Alright, I guess I am just pushing back against the idea that the development talent for Bitcoin core is insurmountable by other teams. I'm sure myspace had great development talent, but at the end of the day, development talent focused on the wrong ideas doesn't trump less skilled developers working on the right ones. Just an idea.

Does Bitcoin have the best developers?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:14:01
Immutability refers to the shared ledger and the inability of a single actor to alter the ledger without consensus from others in the system. From my understanding, if I have more hashpower, I can alter the history of the chain by splitting, mining more blocks, and then reintroducing a new chain. Is that not the case? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:17:13
Gotcha, that would definitely be a positive development!
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:09:55
But why do we act as if Bitcoin developers are gods? Are there not other competent developers (dare I say "better") working on other coins?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:11:31
Interesting. So the assumption is that over time it will become far more decentralized than its current relatively centralized state?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:20:47
I won't argue that one. I am just saying, holding up the idea that "best devs = best tech" is faulty logic.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:17:56
If people attack and succeed, that negates the idea that it is immutable.
Immutable: unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
That is the assumption, but that assumption is predicated on the idea that an attack on that immutability would be overly costly to the actor. However, what if the actor sells their stake in the token (limiting loss to them), and is willing to take on the cost associated with destroying trust in the system?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:03:57
Is Bitcoin decentralized? Aren't miners pretty tight knit and able to create coalitions representing &gt; 51% of the hash rate? Doesn't that mitigate the immutability idea?

Economics is reflexive. Obviously It’s all circular. However, money as money is not binary. Not all fiat currencies even remotely fit the academic definition of “money”. It’s a continuum and if at the margin people are moving towards something as money rather than away relative to other mediums as money, then eventually it will be widespread. The classical definition of money comes after maturation, not before.
I think the intrinsic characteristics of non-sovereign money are attractive and in some cases necessary for people around the world. Because bitcoin has liquid markets and some merchants accept it as payment, it is along the continuum of a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. Hell, bread is on that continuum as well. However, I think it’s intrinsic characteristics give it a great chance (compared to something like bread) to mature into “the” store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. 
However, this new money will be instituted by the people rather than a sovereign entity.

Not sure why throwing stale bread can be valuable but divisibility/transferability over a digital network is not.

Only 100 years from now, will we look back and realize the magnitude of Bitcoin’s importance in the arch of human development.
For the first time, individuals are seizing monetary monopoly away from the state. For a long time, the monetary authority of the state was necessary to establish ubiquitous value systems that enabled efficient trade. 2009 marked the invention of a commodity with intrinsically valuable characteristics (divisibility, verifiable scarcity, ease of transfer, openness) that will push extrinsic characteristics (network effects) and the benefits (stability, liquidity, value storage) to take hold given time. As superpowers continue to wield their monetary weapons (USA/China) at the expense of less powerful nations, self-interest will drive individuals and eventually those nations to adopt Cryptocurrencies (most likely one) as the standard for value.
2009 marked the beginning of the revolution. What we will see 100 years from now as the natural evolution of money, today seems radical. What does a world look like where fiat regimes are reigned in and every man, woman, and entity is held accountable for its fiscal deeds? Most people use simplistic mental models framed by the structure of their world today to assess the likelihood of events in the future and as a result, they miss the first principles that are driving Bitcoin’s story.
Don’t let price day-to-day make you forget what is already set in motion. We are privileged to be apart of such an important moment in the human story.

You are caught up in semantics. “Intrinsic” means belonging to naturally. A natural characteristic of Bitcoin is its divisibility etc. That is not debatable. I’m making the case that these intrinsic characteristics are valued characteristics for the money use case by extrinsic actors. Price appreciation is related to extrinsic actors increasingly (not binary) forming consensus around bitcoin as money largely because it possesses intrinsic characteristics that make it “convenient”/useful/valued for the money use case. Bread on the other hand, does not possess intrinsic characteristics that make it “convenient”/useful/valued as money.

I agree with almost everything you said besides the attribution that my words are “crazy hyperbole”. Maybe strong, but not exaggerated. 
Also, fraud is easier to carry out under a cash based system. Immutable ledgers don’t lend themselves well to fraud.
Modern currency is an incredibly valuable technology. I think bitcoin is a superior form of that technology. The counter-party risk under the current system is too large. Any system that allows irreparable destruction of generational wealth in &lt; 6 month through debasement carried out by a central party is not sustainable in the face of a viable alternative. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:13:33
I’m not assuming it has value. I’m saying those characteristics give it a level of intrinsic value. Although, Extrinsic factors drive the majority of the value that results in price appreciation.
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:47:09
I think you’re misunderstanding what I’m trying to convey. Divisibility and the other aspects mentioned are valuable for the money use case and are intrinsic characteristics of Bitcoin. The extrinsic network effects are what make magnify and make these intrinsic characteristics extremely valuable.

If you have a deflationary currency, you are incentivized to be a saver/creditor. The reduction in demand for credit denominated in an inflationary currency would be offset by the increased supply of credit in a deflationary currency.
Basically I’m saying the effects would be equivalent/cancel out.
