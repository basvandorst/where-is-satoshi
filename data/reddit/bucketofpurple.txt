How decentralized...
@_date: 2016-08-02 11:57:27
A meeting took place that will probably decide the course of action for the near future of Bitcoin, and nobody yet knows what happened. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 13:08:13
Can you elaborate please?
Do investor regulations affect the company they're invested in?
@_date: 2016-04-27 06:06:43
Sorry if this is a noob question, but how did they figure the possibility of a tumbler being used?
I cannot tell that from the link above...

Can you recommend a book you like?
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:58:33
Thank you, I've purchased it and will start reading as soon as I finish "Beyond Democracy" which was also recommended on this sub.

@_date: 2016-06-04 08:34:22
Which backyard? Zipcode etc
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:53:08
Or the newbies who do not understand the system completely yet.
@_date: 2018-10-01 18:22:23
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:49:19
Noob question but can you elaborate on how someone with the seed can't just swipe the BTC?
@_date: 2018-10-01 12:10:49
For you guys asking:
- Socks are Kimchi socks
- Show is التأمين on CNBC Arabia. Episode is here: 
- Our startup is called Addenda and is based on Hyperledger fabric. More info:  
P.S: Kimchi people, if you're reading this, you should send me free socks!

 &amp; 
twitter is not very active yet but is 
@_date: 2018-10-01 18:22:12
1) no.
2) Why would you assume this was done in Saudi Arabia? You know there are 22 countries in the Middle East, right?

Your asking because you wish to trade Second Life to BTC via VIrWox?
@_date: 2015-07-02 11:06:49
"that pimp" ahahahahahahahaha
@_date: 2015-07-17 12:04:23
It should still be an option.
Customer convenience comes first
@_date: 2015-07-05 06:11:15

@_date: 2016-09-22 06:29:17
I'd walk in just to steal some of your burger patties.
Best burgers ever!
@_date: 2016-09-05 05:55:32
It might be a Rubicon Jeep Wrangler
@_date: 2016-09-20 08:20:36
Hmmm... It will be difficult to implement. 
How many confirmations would be needed before you can truly "buy" or "sell"?
Perhaps unless there is some configuration between Ledger and Bitstamp where whatever transcations between Ledger and Bitstamp would be placed in a 2-3 escrow or something to prevent any form of 0 confirmation double spending... But I'm just thinking out loud here
@_date: 2015-04-01 06:11:31
Sent you a PM!
@_date: 2015-04-01 06:11:16
I might do just that. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-04-14 08:59:35

I was there haha! It was so cool
They got 3D printing downstairs... and the top floor has an anonymous video conference session with others every two weeks or so?
@_date: 2016-07-30 15:19:19
Are you the guy talking in the video?
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:32:01


Pardon my ignorance, but why would a country want to devalue their currency? I've read this everywhere... China buying stacks of USD and storing them in facilities etc... What use is it to China to have their currency at such a low number?
Also, aren't they losing money when they buy BTC at such a steep price in comparison to other exchanges? Why aren't chinese investors just purchasing BTC on the cheaper alternatives like BTC-E?
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:33:19
Yeah, I've heard that before.
Keep in mind that the Chinese TV stations are owned by the government, and they were the ones promoting BTC in the first place.
Is it even possible for a country to "horde" BTC? Wouldn't hording the currency make the difficulty less and mining produce more of it?
Is BTC finite?
I hope I'm not asking too many questions, folks.
