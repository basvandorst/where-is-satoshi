Thanks you, as always this is a great read!

This is a sad story. You had an opportunity to bring wisdom and instead haphazardly stumbled through an awful conversation. You could have let them know you were going to gift some to them but if they wanted to opt out they could get the cash equivalent. In future years, when mass adoption happens you can offer again and see what happens.

My apologies, can you elaborate? Why would they implement a reduce traffic options if not for this scenario?

I'm Canadian and have tried QCX and Coinsquare, I can tell you Coinsquare has been much better and safer. Hope this helps and welcome!

Was anyone else expecting them to end the article with "Hodlers" instead of "holders"?

Please wake me up when Bitcoin ETFs become available.

I have a quick question about: 08: The SegWit2X contentious hardfork gets called off. -- What did Bitcoin Gold accomplish by forking?
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:25:12
I laughed so hard! I'm debating re-posting this as I think half the people watching this would actually think there's nothing wrong with the video while the other half would laugh out loud.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:29:59
Thank you. At one point, did they want to integrate Segwit2X?

Thank you for this amazing recap, we need more posts like these. It may be easier to read for some if it were bi-weekly. Thanks again for putting this together.

Though I really enjoyed the joke and agree that we don't have to tell others about our power levels, I do think it's important to talk about this revolution. The more it's talked about, the more people begin understanding this revolution.

Super relevant actually. Did the same a few months ago and you're right it will all be profit at one point. Best of luck, thanks for the great post.

We'll have a moon landing event! The entire planet will be watching.

Thank you, I was actually looking for this. I'm happy to run a node, but last month it cost me $50 in overage fees. I'll tweak the node and start running it again.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:56:50
Take us to the moon!

I believe Coinsquare works in Autralia too.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:11:50
I've heard horror stories of Kraken. Coinsquare has been the best for me so far.

When you speak 5 languages and wait to see if they say "over 8,000" or "over 9,000".

I'll be hodling until we can purchase day to day items with Bitcoin. The idea is that the price will eventually stabilize and we'll be able to attribute a Bitcoin value to experiences or purchasable items.

Agreed, I always transfer to my wallet after. But I'm still waiting on a transfer and it's taking much longer than usual.

Thank you for your response QuadrigaCX. Are you able to provide ball park estimate of time as to when we will see the money wired to our QuadrigaCX account? Thank you in advance.
