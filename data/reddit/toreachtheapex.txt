Hows it feel to be stupid and miss so many opportunities to make profit?

I can't even access my money because I have to go through a 2Fa to sign on but my phone that they text the code too is broken and I can't change the phone # because I need a webcam and I'm currently overseas on a mission.

Had 90 dollars in, watched it blow up to 2000, then go a the way back down.  
Never bought more, never sold.  
Just watched it happen.

I have many shares of NVDA so everytime crypto goes up, my stocks go up. They're interconnected. Haha.

If Russia actually did this, would that mean war?

Well if it wasnt safe it wouldn't be as popular as it is

Stupidest mindset ever because people are so fucking spoiled and ignorant and forget about their mortality.

Ive made 10k with btc as a casual long term trader. I bought at 450 and sold at 17k and bought at 3.6m and sold at 8k and now I buy at 8k and will sell at 16k
@_date: 2019-09-30 18:42:10
Im pretty good at it.
@_date: 2019-09-30 04:16:07
I'm just here to buy low and sell high
@_date: 2019-09-26 01:16:13
I was, and many people were, down to buy bitcoin at 3-7k but I really dont think a lot of people are down to buy bitcoin at 8, 9, 10, 11k. No one has that type of money. If youve been hodling for awhile now and have that much accrued, its a lot different for first time buyers. Its an intimidating investment.

I was panic selling but my hotel WiFi was so shitty it wouldn't let me click the button lmao and then the price started going back up
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:09:40
After the crash I said fuck it and bought it when it was low. Now all these months later its actually looking like it might blow

Good run, boys.

Its what a majority of people would be using and that's why this currency sucks.
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:55:23
20,000 BUYER HAHA I REMEMBER THEM
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:46:18
I mean yeah I can imagine how that would be the case. Did you sell at the peak?

Can't buy a new car in Bitcoin tho
@_date: 2019-05-15 07:26:14
I take full credit for this. Been searching "BTC price USD" ten times daily for the past 4 months
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:53:41
I'm going to be out of the country for 5 months starting in january so I'm kind of building my stash before I take off and hope to get home to see it have grown.  
Just like last time.
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:43:36
I did too. Dream I sold at 30k. Last night
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:39:05
I'd have way more confidence?
@_date: 2019-05-09 10:58:30
No idea how that works
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:28:44
All the miners are already getting out. It's time to get out.  Even your family thinks so. It's time.

Totally. I would've bought a car.  
But I get what you mean. If you sell that much BTC, it's hard to get that much back at any point.  
That's why stocking up now is crucial right?
