Is that a smooth transition though? If most of bitcoin is currently seen as investment funds, once it shifts to a store of value these people will want to move their funds to a better investment. If there aren’t enough people buying for it to be a store of funds won’t there be pretty big problems?

Kudos to you for being able to do that, but I would assume that you are faaar from the majority.  I don't think anyone in the majority will have nearly enough money that this is feasible. For the majority of people a 10% fluxation in the buying power of their currency will make a huge impact on their lives.

To clarify I think that the vast majority of the demand for bitcoin is as an investment not as a spendable currency. Which brings me back to my point that this will eventually need to flip where the demand is for a spendable currency first and the supply is for people moving their investment funds elsewhere. But to me this seems like a double edged sword unless this shift matches up evenly b/c it will cause volatility which will ruin what was causing that shift in the first place.

I see this as a chicken and the egg type scenario though. Bitcoin is never going to measured against everything else at this scale until it has become a stabilized currency that majorities uses to purchase "everything else" you are measuring it against, right?

Can you elaborate. Buying power of fiat currency is waaaay more stable than bitcoin is it not? Maybe I'm missing something but while yes fiat currency does fluctuate and has it's significant moments as well but relatively bitcoin has a long way to go to be comparable right? 


I think this is a little overzealous. 1. a guaranteed(yeah yeah I know it's not guaranteed but relatively) -3% vs a small sample size of +800% could very well be worth 0. I don't think it will be 0 but I think at this stage of the game purchasing bitcoin should come with the understanding that it cooould end up at 0, or at least has a much better change of being worthless than the USD does.
