dude that looks great  with the lights hooked up 
love it

I could cut it mild steel but then it would be more expensive to ship so it's kind of a wash
I could make it smaller

Sign sits slightly proud of the wall and comes with hanger spots to mount it.   can be painted or left with a brushed aluminum finish
@_date: 2019-10-31 00:56:13
I know it's a bit pricey
Half of the cost is shipping.    Weighs 4 pounds
Anyone interested if we make some smaller ones.    Say the size of a piece of paper.    Maybe be able to do that for half the price 
Would have to double check the post office
I'll look in to it

its all cut out of 1/8 aluminum.   weighs like 4 pounds       not much at all

I was thinking something similar.   Was going to set it out from another circle and put some LEDs inbetween.        But ya your idea would probably give off a more even light
@_date: 2019-04-29 13:05:25
I have some clear acrylic that I'm going to mount behind it and then install some LED's in that.     Just trying to figure out how to do it properly.

@_date: 2019-04-24 12:21:22

Going to router the acrylic. Just not sure if that's going to give me a nice enough edge.     Have to polish it some how
