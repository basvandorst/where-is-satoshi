The IRS document says this:

I might have been confusing about someone else I'll defer to your memory
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:20:02
It's gleaned from the IRS document. To quote:


A-12: A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the 
same extent as any other payment made in property. For example, a person who in the 
course of a trade or business makes a payment of fixed and determinable income using 
virtual currency with a value of $600 or more to a U.S. non-exempt recipient in a taxable 
year is required to report the payment to the IRS and to the payee. Examples of 
payments of fixed and determinable income include rent, salaries, wages, premiums, 
annuities, and compensation.

Technically correct. the best kind of correct.

I won't go for less than 6 bananas. At $1.50 per issue, and $0.24 per banana at Target, I see no reason to charge any less than 6 bananas.

Some could have more than one. And all that's needed to open an account is an email address so they don't have to all be american.

"Temporarily unavailable" I think was the language used in the alleged IRC chat logs.

They're just temporarily unavailable.

You don't have to, but it takes technical skill to generate new public keys, tie them into orders you receive on your website, and track when payments are made/confirmed. Not everyone with an ecommerce website has that skill.


I'll agree that they're not strictly necessary, but that's not to say enabling Bitcoin payments for thousands of existing sellers would do nothing for the Bitcoin economy as a whole.


I disagree.
These services are already providing payment processing for websites all over the world. If 'old-market' payment processors can handle Bitcoin payments for their customers transparently, how is that NOT added value?

If you look at the [BitPay press release]( they link to a [YouTube video]( (in finnish, I'm guessing) of a news report that discusses BitCoin's status as legal currency in Finland.

You'll notice it's called 'Featured Merchants' and lists one merchant per category. Still doesn't explain why there are 6 pages and not four.
It would seem that the complete list of merchants is unavailable.
@_date: 2012-09-06 05:14:36
Actually the full message has another @ symbol at the beginning.

Nope. 
A statistical dead heat. One poll shows Obama up one point, another shows Romney up by 3.
@_date: 2012-09-11 17:26:10
Based on the links provided by below, it would seem a complete list is unavailable. Bitpay's website lists about a dozen 'featured' merchants. The press release on their blog lists at least two additional businesses.

Probably same as any refillable debit card: SSN.

Wait, I thought I read they were claiming there was NO breach. I'll be back with a link one way or the other...
Edit: Everything I'm seeing for the past few hours of news postings all have the same quote from PWC: [no evidence of a breach](

Nor do they have to tell you they're federal officials or knock on your door announcing their presence when executing that warrant.

It won't necessarily always have the top result. There's no way to gaurantee that, but the google algorithm does factor in link backs.
Simplistically this means the more sites linking to bitcoin.org, the higher the result. Since every bitcoin site should link to bitcoin.org for an explanation of how bitcoin works, it should be at least near the top.
@_date: 2011-12-13 14:10:39
Have you told them that?
@_date: 2011-05-24 14:33:12
Terrible idea. You can only send BTC with your private key. Anyone with access to your private key can take all of your BTC.
The real solution is to have an app on every smartphone that can scan a store's QR code containing their payment address. The app would then send the payment out from the wallet stored on your phone.
@_date: 2011-06-21 13:37:41
A "buy at 0.0101" would likely be 0.0102
0.01 * 1.0065 = 0.01065 ~ 0.0101  
0.0101 * 1.0065 = 0.01016565 ~ 0.0102
@_date: 2011-06-29 13:31:51
Well, they could offer services to merchants where they guarantee quick processing of payments. This idea has been floated around on the forum in the past.

Looking at the [all-time]( chart is interesting. The past month or so hasn't been too far off from the baseline as seen before the spike in popularity in June. $3 might be about the right price for now.

@_date: 2011-06-10 15:01:58


If there aren't any buyers, no transactions happen and the money stays in the accounts. The money doesn't just disappear because no one's buying. It just becomes impossible to unload what you have. You're stuck with BTC if no one will buy it back.


They gross 0.65% per transaction. Estimated at $30,000/day at one point. How much of that goes towards expenses (current and future) and how much goes in their pocket is anybody's guess.
