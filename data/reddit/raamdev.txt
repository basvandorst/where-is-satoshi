I found this part about "after tax pay" most interesting:


If you work for a company that accepts payments online, it might be better to get your company to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for the service/good they sell and ask them if they'd be willing to pay part or all of your salary with the Bitcoin received, before it's ever exchanged out of Bitcoin. I'm not sure how employers would handle this from a business tax standpoint though. 
In any case, if companies could offer employees the option of receiving some of their paycheck in Bitcoin, that would be awesome--a great automatic investment feature for those buying and holding Bitcoin regularly.

This is great! Thank you! I added two new features to this plugin: a WordPress shortcode that lets you display the tip box manually and a new option to disable automatically inserting the tip box on all posts.
You can find my fork with these new changes here: 
This plugin inspired me to add a new "Tip" button to the bottom of posts on raamdev.com. Cheers!

Only time will change that sentiment.

Thanks for the update. I withdrew 50+ BTC and it's been over an hour with nothing showing up on the blockchain... trying not to worry.
Scratch that. Just as I was typing this it showed up as unconfirmed in my wallet... phew! At least I know it's out of Bitfloor.

Thanks for this plugin! As mentioned above, I added a few features here:

I'd say be patient... at least that's what I'm doing. I transferred a large amount of BTC a little under an hour ago to my Bitcoin-Qt wallet. Bitfloor balance shows 0 and the transfer no longer shows as pending, but blockchain.info has yet to see anything about the transfer to the address I used. If they have a ton of people transferring out, it could be the reason for the delay. I just hope somebody didn't shutdown outgoing BTC transfers too...

This is awesome. I live in Boston and have visited Veggie Galaxy a few times in the past few months. My other favorite destinations are 1369 Coffee House and Life Alive a few blocks away, the latter of which I personally know the owner (and Life Alive has three locations now). 
Do you have any advice as to how I should go about pitching the idea to them? Or would you guys be interested in doing the meeting if I could set it up?

I opened both of those links (clarkmoody.com and Sierra Chart wiki) and then quickly closed both tabs when I realized they are *not* going to help with my lack of productivity!

I withdrew 50BTC+ and it took over an hour to go through... all the while I was trying not to panic. It felt weird to have so much money moving in a way that, if lost, I could do absolutely nothing about. 
On the other hand, it felt really good to see my Bitcoin show up as unconfirmed in my wallet. It suddenly felt safe, knowing that the blockchain knew about it, like it was back in "the hands of the people", people who are, for all intents and purposes, good. Thank you, Bitcoin. Thank you humanity for being inherently good.
This event made me realize why there are still a lot of people who prefer their gold, or USD. When you don't understand something, it's hard to trust it. I grew up with technology. A month of reading and I understood Bitcoin well enough to trust it, but just think about all those people who are still figuring out how to plug in their computers...
