From Remitano website: "Remitano provides a service that allow you to send money to friends and family across countries within hours or even minutes, at a very fair fee."
They do take fees, not from the Exchange, but from their unrevealed remittance's service

They don't reveal much, but as far as I know. Remitano is announcing that they can solve the fundamental problem for bitcoin remittance: "The entry point". Many people still can't lay their hands on bitcoin because they can't find an entry point. Wiring money to exchanges take around 5 - 7 days, and in some country they don't even allow you to do an internatonal bank transfer.

Remitano already switched to segwit for all of its addresses and transactions since last week.

As long as we don't make bitcoin transactions, they will leave us alone.

Where are the coins? I thought there must be tons of coins inside the ATM. Where did they go? Did somebody steal them?

We are a group of iOS and website developers and we love Bitcoin. We are already developing an app for bitcoin on iOS. More ideas would be interesting.
