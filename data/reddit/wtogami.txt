It is also important for everyone to better understand the purpose of Gitian and how it relates to GPG signatures.  Gitian is a tool that allows anyone to build a given GPG-signed tag from git and get bit-for-bit identical binaries.
For example, here you can see several independent persons signed the same gitian hashes.  This suggests that several independent people all built the `v0.13.0rc3` git tag for themselves and got the same binary output. 
Part of the community-based immune system is for many different people to build.  If their outputs do not match others submitted to `gitian.sigs` then an alarm can be set.
It is important to note that the concern expressed on bitcoin.org here has nothing to do with the Gitian deterministic binary build process.  It appears to suggest that download sites or TLS certificates used for "secure" communication could be compromised.  This is a general risk with any site when users download any binary.

*Don't Trust, Verify*
Folks should exercise caution.  Much like how block explorers may seem convenient it is generally dangerous to rely on any third party to check anything on a blockchain.  For example, If you have an automated service that uses third party verifiers for things like checking the status of incoming payments, then you run the risk of such information being unreliable by accident or intentionally one day.  The entire point of Bitcoin is everyone can and should verify every record for themself in an automated fashion.  The cost of verifying everything is not high, especially compared to the potential size of fraud losses or losses of reliability from unnecessary reliance on third parties.  It is also notable that you unnecessarily leak a lot of information when you query third party services.

More importantly, Litecoin years ago discouraged the creation of spam outputs by imposing an additional fee for each spam output.
Bitcoin would have had a measurable amount of additional room now if we had dealt with the UTXO externality issue years ago when the problem was identified.  Doing so would have imposed a cost on creating millions of uneconomically small outputs that bloat the blockchain both during creation and again when they are combined in transactions.  There are a few easy steps like this that we could still add to encourage more efficient use of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Elements are the individual feature experiments that are under investigation in a collaborative open source project.  "Alpha" just happens to be a collection of the first group of experiments conveniently smashed together to run as a single chain because it is too inconvenient for people to test many different chains for each individual feature.
The long-term intention is anyone can choose whatever Elements they want to include and make their own sidechain for specific purposes.  This could be quite powerful as they can do so without permission of the Bitcoin network.
Over time additional experiments will be proposed and developed in the project.  I would imagine that improvements in those experiments will sometimes be incompatible.  Since this is testnet there is nothing lost in abandoning the previous chain and starting a new dev testnet chain.  The next dev chain will be named Beta, followed by Gamma and Delta...
So I can guarantee that Elements will pass beta.  Just not in the way you were thinking. =)

Similar warnings of recklessness were raised in this drama a year ago.  Since then we've seen major preventable accidents what happened in ETH or ZCash stemming from people rushing or changing things that they do not understand.  These disasters were not only foreseeable, they were foreseen.
Blockchains need to be treated like aerospace engineering.  In "normal" modern startups it is often fine to rush to market with whatever code you've got as such systems can be patched later.  That doesn't cut it with blockchain technology where trust in the system relies on rock solid reliability.  We've seen many examples of these systems exploding during flight due to poor design or engineering practices.

You advocate for a future where the world's asset transactions are on the Bitcoin chain.  Others advocate for the world's coffee purchases to be on the Bitcoin chain.  There is a fatal inconsistency of logic in the position that everything should be "on-chain":  If everyone used it this way, no blocksize would be big enough.
Blockchains do not scale.  This is especially true of decentralized blockchains.  The best chance Bitcoin has to sustainably grow to serve global use cases is through a combination of layer 1 performance/efficiency improvements and several different interoperable layer 2 solutions.
Your competitor Rootstock understood these truths long ago and thus targeted themselves on the sidechain approach.

**Why It's OK for some "Valid" transactions to never be mined**
Say you want to buy something online with the cost of $100k.  You have the money to buy it, but you broke it into 10 million 1 cent coins buried in locations around the country.  You give the vendor a complete list of GPS coordinates to find all 10 million of the coins.
How should the vendor respond to your payment method?  Is this a valid payment?  You insist that they could collect all the coins and obtain the face value thus this is a valid payment.
In reality the vendor would ignore you because the cost of realizing the face value of your "payment" greatly exceeds the value they would receive.  Your payment might be "valid" but it's OK for the transaction to never complete.  Eventually everyone forgets about it and life goes on.
In the case of Bitcoin, these spam transactions are meant to disrupt the network by artificially inflating the cost born by all full participants.  **It is OK for such otherwise "valid" transactions to be ignored and forgotten** because they were never meant to be an actual payment where a receiver is expecting to realize economic value.
Note that this is a different issue from real non-spam payments that were mistakenly sent with a fee that is too low.  That is generally the fault of wallet software that must become smarter in awareness of market conditions.  I think good wallet software should also give options to users to choose a fee rate based upon their appetite for confirmation delay.  Over time wallets will become smarter not only in fee estimation, but also utilizing more advanced ways of reducing the global network cost of transactions like cut-through, signature aggregation or payment channels.

Regarding  it may be wise to acknowledge recent studies by jtoomin and others in consultation with Chinese miners which found that 2-3MB is roughly the current safety limit.  The Core roadmap does include the necessary work on IBLT and weak blocks that would improve block propagation in the average, expected case.  That work must happen to allow for most blocks to traverse the network more efficiently.  Unfortunately it does not solve the problem in cases when "miner's behave strategically", so keeping within the known safety margins is necessary to avoid hazards.

I think the esteemed panda is referring to the GPLv3 or LGPL of the qt library used by the GUI client.  I am not familiar with qt in particular, but I'm guessing this company behind qt is able to offer dual open and paid commercial licenses because that is their right when they have copyright ownership of the original work.  Companies like this are in the business of being very permissive with Open Source uses but they expect payment for closed source licenses of their work.  I think that also means they are the only party with standing to make copyright demands.

Some developers theorize a future flex cap could hypothetically be safe if the miner had to somehow pay a cost to allow for increasing the cap. Examples were Maxwell's flex cap and similar presented by Friedenbach at the 2015 Scaling HK conference.
Other examples of a flexible block size were fundamentally flawed:
* BIP100 was dangerous to centralization in that miners could choose a block size at a whim without any cost to themselves.
* The so called "Adaptive Block Size" was explicitly defined to enable there to always be excess capacity ... which should be LOL to anyone who subscribes to reality.

To be clear, this is one of 3+ possible proposals in the works among people who work at Blockstream.  There is no "party line" where the company can tell the developers what they should believe.
* There is a lot of merit to Pieter's draft BIP.  We should openly discuss it in public alongside the other draft BIP's.
* Others are in favor of an entirely different approach to increasing the block size that would more in line with actual transaction demand while making no guesses about what things will look like in the future.  This proposal is a bit more complex and is currently under development.  I'm personally working on getting this stuff written down so it would be easier for everyone to understand, to enable developing this approach with the global developer community.
* Some hope the drama can calm down to allow for a return to a constructive, collaborative technical process as is common in Open Source development.  The recent environment of incivility and personal attacks has led them to be highly reluctant to agree to any controversial changes while under duress.  A meta-solution in favor of bringing professionalism and academic discipline to the questions surrounding Bitcoin Scalability is currently under proposal between developers, academics and commercial stakeholders.

Herd mentality can often convince the ignorant public of technically poor solutions, so the real experts need to be strong enough to resist bad ideas backed by large pressure.

I woke up now and the first thing I read is this bullshit.  This Medium post completely full of intellectually dishonest half-truths and outright lies.  Beware: The writer has long been a "big blocker" who blamed other people, especially the Bitcoin developers, for the failure of his company.
So many points need a complete rebuttal but I need to leave for work right now.  I hope people can expand upon this.  Here are two points that popped out for me:


It is well known that the newest generation of the antagonists' ASICBOOST capable miners contain a powerful onboard FPGA.  With the right firmware it can indeed do this pre-processing.  (I think earlier models also had a less powerful FPGA which formerly was for the purpose of generating work fast enough as software running on previous "wifi router" type embedded CPU's could not keep up.)
 


He should know very well that nobody is proposing a HF to eliminate ASICBoost.  It is simply not necessary.

I think for now the satellite service broadcasts only the recent blocks so you will need a different source for the historic blocks. Might be easiest if you ask a buddy to sync the historic blocks and put it on a disk for you. After you are fully synced it is a low-cost way of keeping synced thereafter without using your monthly bandwidth allotment.

While this is outrageous and people are right to be offended by abuses of this and other antagonist entities, it is unproductive for us to only express outrage on social media.
The way to fight patents is to identify and submit prior art as part of "interference" proceedings. Prior art is anything published that anticipates the claimed invention prior to the application.  Anticipation can also be possible in cases where the claimed invention would have been obvious to a person skilled in the art prior to the application.
Ordinary people can do this but it would be more effective if the ecosystem were to coordinate its actions. For example, the ecosystem can jointly fund one or multiple efforts to hire tech attorneys experienced in this type of research.
Even if this ecosystem were to somehow agree to jointly fund such efforts, money is not the biggest problem. Ordinary patent attorneys would need a significant amount of education in this technology in addition to guidance combing through the many years of cypherpunk posts and poorly organized tribal knowledge scattered across the Internet.

Be careful about how you explain IBLT.  Block compression of that type pre-forwards known transactions, making the final transmission of the found block super fast with a tiny amount of data.  IBLT optimizes the average expected case while it can make the worst case of unexpected transactions worse.

The dust threshold was an improvement but in my opinion it didn't go far enough.  Segwit will soon improve it a bit by reducing the cost of cleaning up UTXO's relative to the cost of their creation.  But the problem remains that it is still too cheap to make UTXO's.  I would have preferred that the cost be front-loaded to discourage creation of pollution to begin with.  For example, last year during the so called "stress tests" somebody burnt tens of thousands of dollars to create millions of UTXO larger than the dust limit as part of the Hearnia political campaign.  That type of pollution of creating many tiny UTXO should be prohibitively more expensive.
This is a flood network.  No blocksize is big enough to make feasible all the world's microtransactions in values of subpennies or pennies.  Anyone who told you otherwise is naive at best, or at worst should not be trusted with what needs to be high reliability engineering.

While I agree with most of your post, the reasons to be cautious about growing use of precious resources go well beyond merely political.   The L2 payment layers like LN have huge potential to grow the real economic activity around Bitcoin, but it relies upon the underlying blockchain to be immutable and as resistant as possible to attacks of all types.  Those attacks could be political, as you theorize, or could be from other causes of disruptions to the global networks.
Consider one example: As we've recently seen with global DDoS attacks crippling large parts of the Internet, the Internet itself can be fragile.  How would the health of the Bitcoin network be in the event of an even worse disruption like if the major intra-continental links were to be cut?  In situations when the fiber links are down, it could easily take hours or days for service to come back for ordinary people.  It is possible to adapt to backup methods of communication, but they tend to be not easily obtainable, relatively slow and very expensive.  The traditional finance world has their own preparedness plans involving dedicated satellite and microwave towers for reasons like this.  Are we similarly prepared?
In engineering it is always prudent to keep actual usage below the theoretical breaking point.  It has taken years for many of the world's top engineers to improve the efficiency, speed and robustness of the Bitcoin Core codebase.  That hard work has improved the theoretical safety margins, perhaps enough for the coming cautious block size increase with Segwit.  Further improvements like Schnorr, cut-through and signature aggregation will allow us to achieve even greater efficiencies of economic activity per unit of storage.  Achieving efficiency gains in this way allows for prudent, gradual growth without compromising the reliability and safety of the underlying network that the Layer 2 solutions will depend upon.

Here are facts regarding my past involvement with the forum ...
* I first met theymos online late 2013 when the forum had a security incident.  Due to my previous experience working on the Linux operating system I was well suited to help lockdown the new server.  I occasionally helped as a sysadmin during 2014 and early 2015.
* After joining Blockstream mid-2015 I was too busy with my day job so my involvement with the forum ended, with the exception of helping him to recover from the mid-2015 incident  when the hosting data center was compromised.
* I worked as a part-time contractor for Slickage during early 2014 for which I was paid a total of $7,035.  I worked on Baron, the self-hosted payment processor, and also conducted some training for their engineers and their summer intern.  I did not work on the software that became Epochtalk.  All of this is public in git history.
  * Note: Baron was originally to be used by an automated ad auction system but by mid-2014 the project was abandoned.  Since then I occasionally had been adding some commits to keep it working as it is somewhat useful as a basic Open Source demo of receiving payments with bitcoind.  As Slickage had ended their involvement with Baron more than two years ago, I moved the project to its own github org today  to enable others to be given access to the project.
The underlying tone of this rbtc drama is from the theory promoted by hysterical scammers that theymos had embezzled donations to the forum.  The allegation is completely false.  As others have thoroughly debunked it for years, I have no need to comment further on that issue.
It is disappointing that a journalist would report on the drama without making any attempt to confirm facts in a situation.  If he had done so, he would realize that there is no legitimate controversy.  Failure to attempt any fact checking makes me wonder if the writer is more interested in promoting a political agenda.
It was amusing to witness the dramatic, factually wrong behavior of the antagonists in that rbtc thread.  They are desperately grasping at straws to find any "evidence" in support their crazy conspiracy theories.  How does it make any logical sense that theymos paying for forum software means Blockstream controls theymos?
Now someone is trying to pose as my name.  I don't know what they attempted to post because it was subsequently deleted.  How desperate are these people that they need to pose as me to make things up?

Responding to uChairmanOfBitcoin in that other sub.
**The antagonists have been trying to promote the idea that Blockstream is somehow exercising some grand conspiracy in concert with prominent community members like theymos.  The reality is a lot more boring.  There is indeed a grand conspiracy ... against a few bad engineers and those who appeal to religious doctrine instead of think for themselves.**
**The tl;dr story below is about how I cared about efficiency of scarce resources in the context of a flood network long before Blockstream existed.  It should not be shocking that many developers would come to similar technical conclusions and end up working together.  It should also not be a surprise that others would happen to agree with those developers because they understand sound engineering principles.**
I was asked how did I find my way into Blockstream?
nullc and I have been part of the same Linux &amp; Open Source Software communities and IRC chat rooms for something like the past 10 years.  We had multiple friends in common and chatted in IRC a few times.  Early 2013 I had to pick a topic for a law school course on Internet Law &amp; Policy to teach to the class during that semester.  I discovered Bitcoin and was instantly intrigued.   nullc was kind enough to answer my technical questions.  That semester I became a contributor to Bitcoin, did significant work toward modernizing Litecoin, and also worked on p2pool.
Very quickly upon joining Bitcoin development I realized there were serious issues pertaining to efficiency.  I was angry that Satoshi Dice was polluting the UTXO set with many 1 satoshi outputs.  The problem is a design flaw in the original Bitcoin where the cost of creating UTXO's and SIG ops are not in line with the cost to the network.  In the case of uneconomically small outputs, it costs far more to spend than to create.  This can be compared to a negative externality like pollution, where private actors externalize costs onto everyone else.
Litecoin is not innovative by any means, but I think their survival while most others had failed is in part because of a historical accident pertaining to how they responded to a UTXO spam attack.  Early in their life they were hit by a massive  spam attack where at very little cost an attacker rapidly created millions of 1 satoshi outputs.  That attack was stopped with a policy-level mitigation: relay would require an additional 1000 byte fee penalty to be paid for every TXO of a value smaller than some economical value.  It simply became expensive to attack the Litecoin chain in this manner so this kind of attack stopped thereafter.
(Note: I am not promoting Litecoin.  I have done nothing at that project since early 2015 and I own zero Litecoin today.  My point in mentioning Litecoin was only in describing the difference in how it handles uneconomically small outputs.)
So early 2013 I felt this was a flaw in Bitcoin.  It was a terrible shame that much of Bitcoin's "startup capital" was being wasted as the result of widespread inefficient use due to broken alignment of incentives.  I tried to discuss this with the then-project leader of Bitcoin.  I was surprised how actively disinterested he was in discussing this issue.  Coming from my background in Open Source, I quickly realized how bad of a job he was doing as an Open Source project leader.  Effective OSS project leaders are not only good engineers but also effective facilitators who coordinate the activities of many developers and help to establish docs and processes to ease the learning curve for newbies to become productive contributors.  This project leader was doing none of this.  The project has been much more productive after others who were doing the actual thankless work were given the opportunity to be lead coordinator.

Warren Togami here, Technical Project Manager at Blockstream:
What is possible right now for anyone who deploys a sidechain based on our open source code release (Elements Alpha) is a federated security model. In a federation, keys are utilized by a set of functionaries for at least two separate purposes: 1) To sign blocks after incoming pegged bitcoin and other internal transactions are verified, and 2) To sign the outgoing peg transactions back to the Bitcoin chain.
Ordinary servers running the sidechain daemon are full nodes that can verify transactions are properly signed.  They can have their own wallet and transact in a manner similar to how people currently use the Bitcoin wallet.  The only difference in a federation-secured blockchain is instead of PoW miners, full nodes verify that blocks were signed by a particular multisig of functionaries.
For this type of federation to be secured, it is important that the private keys necessary for the multisig to be independently controlled by different entities and also difficult for those entities to get access to in order to copy.  If those entities are different leading companies who each host their own functionary, and a supermajority of functionaries are necessary in a multisig for a block to be considered valid, then this arrangement can be very difficult to compromise.  If the keys are generated in a hardened HSM and very difficult to copy without destroying the hardware this could be even more difficult to break.  There are other fine details here that can help but these are the basics of the how and the why.

Segwit reduces the cost of combining UTXO's relative to the cost of creation.  This is an improvement.  I would hope that we later think of ways of front-loading the cost of expanding the quantity of UTXO's, as even after the IsDust() threshold it has continued to be too cheap to create large quantities of uneconomically small outputs.

 was written as a demo.  It seemed to work back then but it has since been unmaintained and may not work with the latest versions of node.js npm modules and the newest Bitcoin Core.  If people want a self-hosted Bitcoin payment processing solution it would be ideal to rewrite it using modern tools and supporting the watch-only wallet now possible in Bitcoin Core.  I would be willing to advise anyone willing to work on this project.

Warren Togami here, Technical Project Manager at Blockstream:
The specific details are not yet set, but it might work something like this - The leading companies who host the functionaries of a federation contractually attend a "potting ceremony" where verified deterministic binaries are loaded in front of witnesses and private keys in a hardened HSM are generated. In this way, everyone knows everyone is running the same code and the keys are not inappropriately copied.

This is a fundamental truth central to the reasons why the safety critical engineering process has strongly resisted calls to change the rules to allow for unbounded growth of raw storage.  It is plainly evident that second layer solutions are needed because the base layer alone cannot scale if everyone were to use it for intended purposes. The base layer must be maintained in a conservative manner as it is nothing if it cannot be relied upon.
People have talked about Bitcoin as "anti-fragile" as if that is a natural property that can't be ruined.   We as a community only make it "anti-fragile" by the rigorousness of process involving peer review and testing.  Bitcoin has a history of original flaws and newly introduced flaws that threatened its existence or at least its reputation for reliability.  It is up to us the community to not accept anything but changes made by the safety critical process.

Please read how the user community has an objective path toward reducing the risk of BIP148.  Core developers will not make decisions.  Users have the real power and need to step up with actual effort to conduct critical advocacy activities right now.
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:44:04
People should not defer to core or wait for the project to decide by the merging of BIP148 right now.  Doing so means the project makes decisions when it really must not be their role.  In some recent IRC dev meeting it was mentioned that merging BIP148 should not happen now, even disabled by default, because it would put users at risk.  The top priority of the peer review process is safety.  You will note that Bitcoin is terribly boring when compared to the repetitive disasters of unrealistic-design-gone-wrong or emergency hardforks like what you see over in ETH-land.
**At the moment it is the correct decision from a safety point of view to not merge things that put users at risk.** Remember this point because I suggest a solution below.
Luke-Jr's recent unscientific Twitter poll showed majority support in favor of BIP148 at 60% with another 20% choosing "Defer to Core."  In my opinion, users should stop begging "Core" to lead in a controversial decision.  Instead users must realize that they have the real power and they need to step up their advocacy game.
**What would it take for the merge to not be construed as putting users at risk?**
It would be objectively less risky for the developers to merge if genuine grass-roots engagement from many individuals and community advocacy groups were to convince exchanges and other major economic nodes to support BIP148. Know though that movements can also be dangerous as people can be too easily driven into mass hysteria.  In this situation however it can be argued with the plain truth that:
1. The abuses of the monopolist cartel and its allied antagonists are far beyond defensible.  These abuses include covert ASICBOOST, patent exclusivity further un-leveling the playing field, forcing customers to follow certain rules or they are cut off from future hardware, threats to destroy forks that disagree with their will, reckless disregard for safety-driven engineering, gaslighting, paid shills and rampant dishonest tactics, and the list goes on. Such blatant, coercive acts cannot and should not be condoned.  Some like Luke-Jr argue further that the users are already at mortal risk from such abuses stalling deployment of already well-engineered improvements.
2. This particular change is the result of many minds of science and engineering, through a **long** period of careful design and peer review, resulting in many benefits to the Bitcoin ecosystem. This was done so while holding safety as the highest priority.  None of these other proposals have come anywhere close to a similar **standard of care** necessary in preparing for and effecting such real and meaningful improvements.
If economic nodes were to agree with the users it would be a snowball-effect of everyone joining.  It is hard to be the first to agree.  Perhaps they might be more amenable to agreeing conditionally on others also agreeing.  It is up to advocacy groups in the user community to organize and execute on some plan to effect the necessary snowball.
Stop waiting for the developers to decide.  You the user community have the real power.

Does this sound like the value proposition of Bitcoin, or centralized policy making?




The only way Bitcoin will survive a hundred years or a thousand years is if the ecosystem defeats power grabs like this.
I believe that safe hard forks are possible in the future.  Acting against the advice of the vast majority of industry experts in a rushed manner only to beat the timeline of a community-driven revolt in no way resembles a "safe hard fork".
