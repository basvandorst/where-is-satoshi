Yes OP, please bring this up re grading him on his effort/skill, not belief. The topic is an opinion piece, no?

So is it worth buying some shares? How does one do that?
@_date: 2014-12-01 02:34:15
Ah thanks for the detailed explanation. The separation of the payment method and the accountability party is a great idea. 
Isn't eBay and Paypal the same company? 
@_date: 2014-11-30 23:07:13
I don't understand, what does reversing the payment method mean?

Can you explain what colored coins are?
@_date: 2014-11-30 23:22:56
Can you explain this more? I didn't know it was even possible to say "no, i said pay for that months ago, but now i change my mind and want my money back, dearest bank"

But it is then possible to end up with someone else's private/public key pair, then? And there is no checking of that?
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:11:18
What i am not understanding is that would there not be a record of sending the coins to another address, or someone saying "these addresses were mine"

Thanks, I really appreciate that!

Was the original post edited? There are a lot of comments about this being an 8th grader and such, but I don't see the back story...
