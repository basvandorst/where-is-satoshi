Looks like reaction to the media has caused another dip, though.
Still, Bitcoin has hard-working developers and a very supportive community. I think that, for a start, many people have misinterpreted it as a way to gain money quickly as opposed to an actual currency. Awareness is always good, although it helps if Bitcoins aren't misrepresented. Certainly, Bitcoin trading volumes increase as more people hear about them.

In other news, however, meme quantity seems to be decreasing now people are complaining about them. If we keep downvoting them, we might be able to boot them off the front page for good.
Keep up the good work!

Bitcoin value seems to be back up, at least for the moment. Hopefully that should convince people to cling on the next time it takes a dive.
Upgrading exchanges is a must, certainly. The whole point of cryptocurrency is that it's hard to manipulate - however, exchanges seem to be the weak point at the moment.

I'm not sure if the DDoS is because of the investors freaking out, but the investors freaking out is certainly because of the DDoS.

You can guess that events like this could happen, yes, but telling when and preparing for it is much harder. That's why it's best to just take it easy.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:28:31
I'm sorry for your loss, mate.
Only advice for dealing with bitcoins or similar exchange services is this: make a small exchange, maybe just a few dollars, to test how the system works before your first major purchase with that exchange. Keep an eye out for fraud, as always.
Question: are you planning to buy any more bitcoins from a different provider now the cost has dropped? If so, I wish you good luck.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:42:33
Well, yes. People have taken this incredibly seriously (as is wont to happen around money) and as such they have lost money, at least in the short term. Knowing Bitcoin I would say that by this point you should probably leave some money in the system just in case anything ridiculous happens again. However, if you don't care what happens to the value of your Bitcoins (as is the case with me) then you can't really lose.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:18:32
To be perfectly honest: It's Bitcoin. It's a highly volatile market. We have next to no idea what will happen. Sure, the price may drop, but it may also go up again. So long as you're not actually taking this too seriously you have nothing to worry about. After all, investing in anything is a risk. Bitcoins have just had bigger risks and bigger rewards so far.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:49:57
Those are beautiful! I would pay you myself if I actually had any money.
But yeah, as it is Bitcoin seems to be going up as a general trend, so who knows? If you do take payments in bitcoins, remember to keep a bit of fiat currency with you as a failsafe. Still - you may as well go for it! Good luck.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:36:27
Well, if you can find someone who needs art I would say go for it. Expanding the range of Bitcoin services available is always a plus, and your art isn't too bad. All I would warn you about is that bitcoin value does fluctuate, so it's not such a safe option as USD commisions. But if you're happy with that, then go for it!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:55:51
Well, maybe you're right. I guess we'll see. The bubble's second failure to pop does look promising, though...
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:40:56
Well, that's nice to see. I guess it's all the people capitalising on the low prices, or else someone really wants to push them back up.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:20:04
Ultimately, nobody knows. If you had an ASIC right now, it would be worth it - however, not only do you have to wait for delivery, many other people will also be getting their ASICs at the same time as well. This leads to a difficulty increase on blocks and as such an equivalent reduction in the frequency of payouts.
Although ASICs may look attractive now, the profits will be smaller. You have been warned. What we don't know is how much smaller.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:54:09
Yes. All I was saying is that large investors may have been hurt somewhat. I hope we get more newcomers, though, because if they drive more price increases we may be able to see Bitcoin value stabilise and maybe start skyrocketing again.

What it really needs right now is a good exchange. At the moment, I feel Mt. Gox mucking about will just put people off.
And since the current wallet's already pretty secure I guess Escrow is the way to go.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:16:06
Okay, so: Whenever you get coins from any site, they'll be sent to your Bitcoin wallet.  You'll need one of these before you go about purchasing any bitcoins. 
Your wallet will have an address in order to distinguish it from other wallets, and to direct where the payments travel to. If you buy bitcoins at an exchange, registering will allow you to enter a wallet address somewhere in the site's settings for your bitcoins to be sent to.
Getting bitcoins from anywhere essentially involves giving them your wallet's address and then doing something to make them give you bitcoins, whether it be filling in surveys or giving them money.
If you plan to buy bitcoins, buy a small amount (maybe a few dollars' worth) from the website before making any big purchases. Ensure you recieve something in your wallet (this can take a few hours). This will help protect you from scam trading sites, who will take your money and give back no bitcoins.
More secure wallets are available by download. These aren't vulnerable to the website hosting them being hacked, but you have to download the blockchain to use them.

Well, the news is a bit behind now. It's on the way back up.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:57:56
BCT-E is telling me that Bitcoins trade for $188, back up from their recent drop to $100. I'm not sure why yours doesn't agree. Did you seriously sell for $58? That's below even the lowest MtGox prices!
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:35:59
Oh, yeah, sorry. I've been working too much with Litecoins recently.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:31:49
Well, that's a pretty impressive chart if you tell me. Planning to keep this updated as the price drops even further?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:39:33
Well, yes. At the moment, I think the only thing keeping them in the game is that many newbie coin-buyers were reccommended Mt. Gox when it sucked less and don't know about any other exchanges. And at this point, I doubt closing down temporarily would do much to redeem them unless it came with a massive apology and a big increase in performance afterwards.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:24:03
Simply put, the exchanges take a fee on all transactions. If a transaction takes place - even if it is panic selling - then the exchange stands to make a profit, despite the massive lag. It is in the exchange's best interest to allow as many transactions to happen in order to allow as much money to go to them as possible.

Fair enough. So, our ideal bitcoin mining setup is this:
- You're never going to do anything else CPU-intensive such as video games on the computer anyway.
- You're going to replace the computer soon anyway.
- You rent the place, or have tapped directly into a power cable, or some other method that gets you free electricity.
So what we're essentially saying is that if you don't spend anything, you can only make a profit! Well, at least that's sorted.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:30:32
Wait till it just starts to rise again, then coin in. That way you can always make something of it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:19:52
I would argue that most of investment is a mix of psychology and luck anyway, but I suppose that's another argument. It's true that that is the curve for bubbles that burst suddenly, however, and I appreciate your insight. Any thoughts on what you're going to do with the bitcoins that I assume you have?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:52:24
The chart is simply one example of what can happen to any investments. Not all investments neccessarily follow that chart: that would just be silly, and make finance insanely predictable.
I'm saying right now that we don't know what to expect from Bitcoin. Some people are quite obsessed with it by this point, so I expect that the price can't drop below their investments' combined value, and in addition Bitcoin gains value when other financial problems happen (such as in Cyprus). On the other hand, the value is currently plummeting. Nobody knows what's going to happen, but I hope it's not that graph. I have seen that graph far too often on this subreddit, so I refuse to let it have the last laugh.

The most valuable folder on my computer is worth like 45 cents.
Here's hoping that my computer decreases in value, or bitcoins rise in value.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:54:14
I believe it's simply because MtGox is already the most popular exchange for BTC, and there are a lot of new Bitcoin users recently. Many of them will ask what other people use and go to that service even if it isn't the best, because they don't know about any others.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:00:02
If you're going to be buying new hardware anyway, as many people do (to keep up with rising hardware and software reqs) then is there any reason to give up mining then?
Also, even if mining may not be profitable assuming you sell at the time, you have to take into account the fact that you're getting Bitcoins, not USD - changes in value may mean the mining you did when it was unprofitable is now worthwhile, or vice versa.
