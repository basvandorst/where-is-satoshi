Have you tried [purseio]( You just need a credit card and you can easily but bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-11 08:08:42
Have you tried [purse.io]( You can use  prepaid credit card or an amazon gc and it's really easy to use.
@_date: 2014-11-20 06:06:34
Try [purse.io]( Really easy to use.
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:28:56
Yeah, it was just a suggestion. For me nothing beats waking up to a fresh cup of coffee before i start my day, makes mornings more tolerable. But i can see how it not be ideal for everybody. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 06:44:52
Maybe try amazon trough [purse.io]( You'll get a nice discount using it.
@_date: 2014-09-04 23:53:32
I agree with oldskool and i would probably wait until it's worth a little more but if you really want to spend it i recomend using something like [purseio]( to make your bitcoin worth a little more.
@_date: 2014-11-04 08:04:11
I think it would be easier to to use [purse.io]( than to convince amazon. You could also try using gyft.
@_date: 2014-11-05 00:56:47
Have you tried [purse.io]( You can use you prepaid visa there and it's how aquired my first bitcoins myself. Really easy to use too.
@_date: 2014-09-03 01:41:51
Well you can already buy a lot of things with bitcoin already and with [purseio]( you can buy things on amazon and get a pretty good discount. But i agree with you main point most people wont really get into bitcoin until it becomes mainstream, although with the amount of people that this has attracted i can see a good amount people researching bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-04 23:19:26
Solid advice, the price is looking like is going back up slowly so it may not even drop as some people have expected. But it  for people who are heavily invested in this, probably shouldn't stay too far away for too long.
@_date: 2014-09-20 04:41:07
I kinda was in the same situation as you as you a when i wanted to make my first purchase. All the verification you have to go through to use coin base seems like a big hassle just to possibly be denied. But made a purchase once i found about [purse.io]( since could buy some bitcoin really easily using a credit card. The exchange rates are not as good a conibase though but i guess it could be worth it when the price is pretty low.
@_date: 2014-09-15 00:06:54
Amazon using [purseio]( You'll also get a pretty good discount. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:36:47
I'm not sure you can buy bitcoins with prepaid cards on circle.com but you can with [purse.io](
@_date: 2014-09-15 23:01:33
You can shop on amazon on through [purseio]( and use bitcoin. But other than that im not aware of any other sites that sell camera equipment for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-05 05:28:23
So, i can't recommend a website if i use my affiliate link lol. I'm not seeing how this contradicts my point.
@_date: 2014-09-22 02:45:49
Ahh, i see. Well you probably wont get a discount higher than 30% on purseio, so you wont be able to make a huge profit. But cryptothrift sounds like a great place to score some good deals.
@_date: 2014-09-22 01:55:20
Oh sorry but im still having a hard time understanding your original post. Did you want to buy gift cards at a discount with bitcoin? Or were you looking to sell them? Or both? 
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:05:37
Yeah, i can't believe they have the nerve to blame it on the "consumers" while, the culprit for so much of out problems come from their selfish actions.
@_date: 2014-08-31 00:52:14
This is a really great idea, im sure lots of musicians on bandcamp would love to get paid in bitcoin. Not sure if this exists yet but it should really be a thing.
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:37:20
Yeah that's the draw back of getting bitcoin so easily. I suggest wanting a until you see a better price, since i've seen some pretty good prices. But other than that you might want to try other ways to get bitcoin a better price.
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:16:09
Well it really depends, what you're trying to accomplish. If you're really pushing bitcoin to become a popular currency then it's probably worth but if your not too worried about that and are just trying to save some money/bitcoin then it's probably not worth it.
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:28:51
You can easily buy bitcoins with a credit card on [purse.io](
@_date: 2014-09-08 22:45:17

@_date: 2014-09-04 22:42:22
Well if you like making your own you could buy it from amazon through [purseio]( and get it cheaper than you would by paying with cash.
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:46:48
I'm not sure this is quite what your looking for but you can buy amazon gift cards(and anything on amazon as well) at a discount on [purseio]( I think you might also be able to find some other kind of gift cards on amazon too.
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:42:56
Just use [purseio]( You can even get it for a little bit cheaper.
@_date: 2014-09-08 22:34:21
