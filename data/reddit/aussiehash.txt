Mycelium iOS would remain on your device, even if removed from the app store
Storing more than a cash wallet amount on a phone app is a bad idea (malware, backdoors, 0 day exploits, etc)
Deleting a wallet from your phone or desktop (whether mycelium, breadwallet, etc) is a bad idea without first moving your funds.
iTunes does backups to iCloud and to your desktop, if you restore a device backup it will restore your apps and their data.
Not keeping backups of your desktop and phone is a bad idea.
If your seed backup is the correct number of words, then probably you hand transcribed one word down incorrectly in your backup. The dictionary of valid mnemonic words is quite short, so you may be able to find the misspelt word.

The **only** source to download the electrum binaries from is 
The design of electrum is that rather than connecting to bitcoin full nodes, it connects to ElectrumX servers, and these can be malicious and instruct people to download malware when you try to spend.
If you installed a malicious fake electrum from any other website, then you might still have malware on your PC, which could have a rootkit, keyboard logger, clipboard address replacing trojan, teamviewer trojan ....
Even when using a hardware wallet, trojans could keylog your passphrase, mnemonic if you do a hardware wallet recovery, and alter your clipboard, etc

A hardware wallet is a enclave for your private keys and a signing computer.  There still needs to be a wallet to generate the transaction, in the case of Coldcard that is Electrum or Wasabi running on your computer.  
* 1) you export your Coldcard's xpub wallet skeleton to your Electrum/Wasabi via a MicroSD card
* 2) you generate an unsigned spend transaction on Electrum/Wasabi and save it as a PSBT (partially signed bitcoin trasaction) and copy it to the MicroSD
* 3) sign the PSBT on your ColdCard from the MicroSS and save the signed transaction
* 4) broadcast the signed transaction from your PC (Wasabi has the best privacy as it broadcasts via tor)

Smart cards/secure elements have been around for 40 years from Satellite TV boxes, payphone cards and credit cards.  The most important feature for our purposes is that they are designed to store secrets, and not trivially hackable by a physical attacker by glitching and level escalation attacks.  Nothing is unhackable.
The Ledger secure element might have supply chain auditing and government body certification but requires the user to trust a "black box".  The supplier specification states they have a secure hardware random number generator, but who knows if a USB battery pack powered Ledger has enough physical entropy (analogous that a PC OS image running in a virtual machine may not have enough physical entropy), or if the hardware random generator is flawed and predictable.  At least Shift and Coldcard add unique factory salt to the hardware random generator.
Regarding Trezor T, I admit I haven't unboxed it, but bought them because of the Trezor One passphrase entry.  It could work well, like trezor one advance recovery, or it could involve the touchscreen needing small fingers / a stylus.  I haven't found a youtube video demonstrating Trezor T passphrase entry.

Armory links to your Bitcoin full node to index the blockchain, depending on your hardware, RAM and dbcache setting it can take hours to weeks for the initial block sync.  It is about 240GB of data, then Armory will have to build it's own index.  If you are using a USB external hard drive you're probably looking at weeks, if you increase the dbcache and use an SSD/NVME, less than a day.
If you made a transaction in July 2019, you wont see it if you're node is years behind in the initial block sync.

Pool operators don't necessarily own all of the hash power in their pool, so if large pools colluded to push a political agenda or to attempt a 51% attack, individual miners would sensibly move their hash power to another pool.
Bitmain does sell mining contracts so they are not necessarily free to do as they please with all of their hashpower, and they have new leadership now.

Trezor mixes PC and Hardware wallet mictocontroller entropy to generate the seed.
Coldcard's latest firmware takes this to another level where you can input dice rolls to add entropy to the secure element entropy, or just use dice rolls alone to generate the seed.

Only [6-7% of transactions are RBF]( I think it is fantastic. I sign in electrum the same (non time critical) transaction with 4 sat/byte, 10sat/byte, 20sat/byte and 40sat/byte.  I check the mempool stats, send the low one, if it hasn't been mined in 8-12 hours, check the mempool again and rebroadcast with a higher fee if necessary.

With crypto the security mantra is trust, don't verify.
If you keep your coins on MtGox or Quadriga, how do you know those coins even exist ? There is no blockchain address you can look up to see of they have moved/sold.
Governments and agencies can confiscate, seize and tax your property (gold, bank deposits, property, superannuation, shares, inheritance) or debase your savings with money printing.
Bitcoin has an enormous unforgeable costliness. No matter if every military pointed their tanks, drones and nukes or spent billions building mining farms, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins.
A full node verifies every bitcoin, from genesis to transaction from the first mined bitcoin block, to the coins (UTXOs) in your wallet.  Go to  and download the Bitcoin Core software, it will start downloading the entire bitcoin history (250GB). 
This is not practical on a phone or ultrabook, in which case you will probably want to trust a 3rd party's full node. In the case of Trezor/Ledger **you** control the spending (private keys) and they provide the wallet software and backend node.

There was a twitter post where somebody made a few PCB mods to a mk1 and attacked the PIN. I believe the PCB trace layout has been modified to make this kind of attack more difficult in mk2.  With the tamper evident "cashbag" packaging and translucent shell, you will be able to see if there are extra wires soldered to the PCB.
I doubt the secure element secret are exported to the microcontroller, that would defeat the purpose of having a secure element in the first place.  Coldcard's technical docs and whitepaper are very detailed.  The PIN secures the pairing secret between the firmware and secure element, so an attacker with your device and PIN can sweep your funds (but that is the same with Trezor and Ledger) unless you have a passphrase.

I have Trezor Pi shield, Trezor one, Trezor T, Keepkey, HW.1, Ledger nano, Ledger nano S, Ledger NFC, Coldcard mk1 and mk2.
You can't go too wrong with any of the top 3, however the passphrase, PIN, recovery and physical security are increasingly important.
Trezor One has a good new advanced recovery method where the mnemonic words are entered with a mouse by random assorted predicting letter grid boxes which is very good, surprisingly I found it easier than even keepkey recovery which randomizes the keyboard every letter.
Trezor one PINs are fairly weak, only 1-9 and their weakness plus the lack of secure element means a passphrase is mandatory.
The Trezor One initialization combines PC and hardware wallet microcontroller entropy (2 sources) to generate the seed which is a nice feature, but means the device must be initialized on a computer.
Trezor One mnemonic passphrase is entered in plaintext in the web browser which is bad for security, especially since Chrome tries to memorize the passphrase, and still shows the plaintext passphrase as a address bar icon after you explicity tell chrome not to memorize wallet.trezor.io passwords.  There is no way to keep the passphrase cold/airgapped, short of having 2 separate PCs.
The need to use Trezor bridge / removal of winUSB is annoying for use with trezor web wallet.
Trezor T by default only uses 12 word seeds which is a downgrade.
Keepkey is always 6-12 months behind Trezor's security so they are probably multiple defcon talks behind.
Ledger Nano S has mushy plastic buttons and a tiny screen, the device runs slower than Trezor and needs to connect to Ledger's own HSM to firmware update and to install apps, so if Ledger ever discontinues Nano S support your S will become a brick (like microsoft's DRM server for music/zune/etc).  Typing the passphrase in to Nano S is a nightmare, especially if you have symbols, mixed case, etc.
Ledger Nano S can be initialized airgapped by battery, because it only uses one source of entropy, with closed source firmware and secure element code.  It wouldn't be difficult to add extra entropy as seen with bitcoinpaperwallet javascript/mouse movement, shift wallet add user touch/timing entropy and factory added unique salt, also coldcard add factory salt and optional dice rolls.
Coldcard is bigger than the others, you'll need a larger storage space. Its translucent plastic shell is far more rigid than the others, and allows you to inspect for evil maid modifications.
The firmware can be built from source and flashed, but it is harder to verify the factory bootloader, but (according to the docs) not impossible.
What I like is the coldcard contains without doubt better physical attacker security, with a secure element and open source bootloader/firmware (unlike Ledger), it is designed to run airgapped 100% with microSD PBST skeleton wallet export and airgap signing, it has 2 sources of entropy like Trezor but without a PC, you add dice rolls to the secure element entropy (or rely on 99 dice rolls as your only entropy, which you can audit with python/sha256), it has tamper evident packaging, it has the best PIN security by far (2 PINs in sequence with a 2 word check half way), far more duress options including a brick me PIN, and the best Passphrase support by far.  Nano S passphrase is painful, Trezor passphrase is exposed to the PC in plaintext. Coldcard passphrase entry is seamless for letters/mixed case/numbers/symbols and BIP39 dictionary words.  
If you are paranoid, use 99 dice words to generate 24 extra seed words (then reset) giving you 4-6 fragments to use as passphrases.  Some prefer seedless security, like Casa, coldcard allows seedless mnemonic backup via encrypted 7z archive on microSD.  The coldcard handles the backup and restore, so the 7z never needs to touch a computer.
The only negatives for coldcard are : no vendor webwallet (must use electrum/wasabi), larger size (harder to hide), crap mk1 touchpad (replaced in mk2 physical buttons) and no shitcoins (which means less profit, less income for coinkite).  Coinkite is a 2 man company, unlike Ledger with &gt;$100 million VC funding and 1.6+ million units sold

Cash meetup = using the site's escrow is fine, you will get a text message saying the funds have been released.
If you meet person to person, that is like meeting someone on Craigslist, except you could be waiting a long time for the bitcoin transfer to be confirmed.
With escrow the bitcoins are locked by LBC and are released to your account off chain (if you use it properly)

Allegedly Satoshi was well aware of the Transaction Malleability issue, but it was not critical as transactions require confirmation via the blockchain, not tx id.

Yes Ledger desktop Chrome Wallet and Android mycelium + Ledger should be equivalent/interchangeable.
Concurrently there shouldn't be a problem - both wallets will broadcast transactions to the mempool, and worst case scenario a clashing transaction will fail if there are are spent inputs. This wouldn't happen unless you tried to spend the same UTXOs as another broadcast but unconfirmed transaction.

The entire blockchain is about 60GB, and depending connectivity can take days to sync.
There is no sum tally column in the bitcoin ledger, so a sync starts with transactions made in 2009 and works forwards to present day. You transaction will not show up until your node syncs to the date of transaction.

Once you add a "wallet" to Mycelium, you will always be able to view balances, even if your Ledger is not plugged in.
Coinkite is a web wallet, so if you log into their site you will be able to view balances. You could also add your multisig address to a block explorer (or blockchain.info app) add the web page to your home screen to check balances.

Keepkey and TREZOR are safe to initialize on an infected machine. KeepKey is the safest to restore as the mnemonic entry is scrambled.
So yes both are safe to use on an infected machine, but because you need a Chrome extension for both tobuse with a browser they won't work in an internet Cafe (where you probably can't install a Chrome extension)

Several new features have been added including USD/BTC price to the LCD, data sent and received to the dashboard and blocks loading status (in addition to the STOPPED and RUNNING status).  Addy may have also disabled verifying blocks as startup post update seems to reach RUNNING status much faster.  Only after you're fully synced will you see the connection count rise, I've seen up to 42 within 3 days.

    $ ssh bitnodes

Ok, that's interesting .....
I haven't done as thorough a look at Trezor given I have thus far been unable to [deterministically build their bootloader](
The SerialNo does persist between device_reset, [despite this]( code.
Edit : still trying to get to the bottom of this ....
Edit 2 : Looks like [serial.c]( gets the [unique ID from the Microcontroller.](
Assuming it cannot be modified, one would have to trust your vendor doesn't keep a database of MCU IDs and buyers. It does mean that someone can't just swap your unattended Trezor, but an evil maid could still make a fake Trezor with an evil bootloader/firmware and display any SerialNo
Edit 3 : it looks like [only Trezor's bootloader_loop]( mode queries the MCU Serial Number and not the Trezor firmware, [unlike bwallet's firmware]( as pointed out [here by slush0](

There are 3 million Coinbase account holders and only about 6000 Full nodes at the moment so people are voting with their feet.


If you want to trade USD/BTC online you will still need an exchange or matching service like coinbase/kraken/localbitcoins/local trader/IRC. If you want to trade person to person you could do so at a bitcoin meetup using your laptop/phone schildbach wallet.


Cold storage can be done with a paper wallet. To transact in bitcoin and maintain your privacy you can do that via your own node (Bitcoin Qt). There are alternatives, Coinkite is incorporated and hosted outside of USA, they have a tor server and don't ask for a real name, phone number, address etc.
Coinbase on the other hand links every transaction you do with your personal identity.

The security card was an ease of use design choice for Ledger Nano. In fact adding that code dumped some existing APIs out of the firmware for space constraints.  They've also decided that future firmware upgrade will not wipe the secret seed as current firmware upgrades to.
The old HW1 firmware used a HID keyboard replay.  You make a transaction on your PC, instead of a screen, you plug the HW1 into your phone/tablet/etc where the transaction amount/recipient and confirmation code are displayed. The same method was used for the initialization hardware generated private seed (which was base64 so not as easy to backup as a word list)

Full nodes verify transactions and relay transactions.
If you want to spend bitcoin your wallet needs to tally up your unspent inputs to determine your net wallet balance. From there you can send funds by generating a transaction and broadcasting it to the network.
If you use a web wallet like blockchain / mytrezor you are trusting their full node. If use a mobile wallet like mycelium you are trusting mycelium's full node. If you use an SPV wallet like breadwallet / multibit you are trusting the random full nodes your wallet connects to.
If you run Bitcoin Qt +/- Armory you are running your own full node, using your local copy if the blockchain to tally account balances and to broadcast transactions. 
Running your own node  let's you connect to yourself with the Schildbach wallet (and potentially also with electrum if you run an electrum server.)
Broadcasting transactions yourself is something you might need to do if you are signing transactions separately on a cold offline device, as well as if you desire privacy for your xpub when looking up balances.

thank you for your reply,
BIP38 and Scrypt certainly sound very compelling, from your Scrypt link


My reservation is that Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 38 was only posted on bitcointalk 18 months ago, and as such might be subject to future revision (there was some mention in that thread of not reusing intermediate keys, etc) which might break backward compatibility with "old" BIP38 wallets. 
No matter what happens to reddit, bitcointalk, GitHub and my hard drive in 5 years time, I am confident I will still be able to decrypt an AES string with **openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc**
If I were to generate my electrum seed offline with adequate random entropy, transfer 100 btc, bippy the seed offline, destroy all physical and electronic copies *except* for a wood/metal cold bippy wallet - how confident can I be that I will be able to recover my coins in 5-10 years?

At the moment it looks like  is undergoing [heavy development on github](  When I login to the [Chrome extension]( the PIN entry screen reveals the PIN length, which is entered via keyboard (susceptible to keylogger). This then leads to a demo wallet with sample transactions.

Are these two services linked via an API such that dcpos' btc transfer directly to your coinjar account (and automatically trade to fiat) ? Or is it a 2-3 step process. What is the delay - 6 confirmations ? 1 business day ? Etc. 
Bitpay also eliminates all risk as you are guaranteed the equivalent fiat amount at time of sale, even if the bitcoin price drops later. Coinjar adjusts their exchange rate every minute.

Once Trezor is publicly available, it will probably be $100-$200 based on the BTC/USD exchange rate when they first started preorders. 
Assuming a BTC price of $800, then 0.25 BTC would not be too unreasonable. That represents 1% of your holdings if you own 25btc. 
On the other hand coinkite has a web wallet and chip protected transaction card. They charge non subscribers a 1% fee of each transaction amount.

It is a cheap attack vector.  Instead of 7001 bad nodes, how about 70,000 bad nodes.  The bad nodes could introduce subtle random errors into the blockchain, or change previous transactions.
The 51% attack refers to miners verifying transactions, generating new blocks and broadcasting them to the network as the longest chain.  Whereas a fork in the network refers to the version of bitcoinQT that the majority of the full nodes are running, ie when QT 0.8 was released and not-backward-compatible with 0.7 nodes, it created a blockchain fork and necessitated major pools to downgrade back to 0.7 so they would rejoin the 0.7 chain.
What if the majority of full nodes were either running evil-QT-version, or the majority of nodes were running an alternate blockchain going back only a few blocks in time (recomputing back say 100+ blocks , cataching up to and then overtaking the main chain would be an expensive attack)

One thing that is glaring is the incorrect references every where to "bitcoin core", you write that was the name of the bitcoin client, also known as the satoshi client, of the Bitcoin project that Gavin became maintainer.
That is incorrect bitcoin.
BitcoinQT for the GUI client and there was the headless CLI client.
Later on bitcoin "core" came about when the client software was modularized to split the consensus code from the wallet, but to call it "Bitcoin Core" from back in 2011 is to spread Ver / Bcash lies and misinformation.

Look I have to agree, coinkite have built an extremely secure "bank vault like secure" platform, which is scalable, currency agnostic and can be licensed by 3rd parties like pools, exchanges, etc.
However they chop and change their prices frequently.
For example their Starter plan originally had 1% fee on withdrawals, no funding limitation, no limitation on number of POS terminals and free withdrawals via the terminal.
First to go was the free withdrawals at the terminal - it became personal and professional accounts only.
The next change was to introduce POS limits AND POS sales fees.  For those early adopter businesses who purchased a terminal, the fees have doubled (1% to accept payments, 1% to withdraw) and for those businesses with multiple terminals, we're now forced to have a business account $310/year.  This change only occurred in the past week.  Now I don't have a problem with bitpay charging 1% merchant fees as they take the risk of 0-confirmation transactions AND convert to fiat.  Coinkite does not convert to fiat for their "1% fee"
I also feel it is completely dishonest to advertise their terminals as an exchange service, whilst making no mention of their 50% fee on any exchange rate %.  For those who invested $900 in a terminal, this fee should have been clearly stated here
The $900 terminal contains WiFi and GPRS connectivity.  This mobile connectivity is currently free.  *For now.*
Their 1% fee on withdrawals is too high IMHO.  If I were to deposit 100btc in by account, do I really want to pay  $625 to withdraw my coins ? Or alternatively pay $105 - $310/year so I don't have to pay 1% to withdraw my coins, when I could just make a bitaddress paper wallet and cold store my coins for free, and use blockchain/coinjar/coinbase for my hot wallet for free.

Trezor makes it safe any easy for everybody to store their own bitcoin, without needing to rely of third parties to do so who are prone to [external hackers, internal fraud, and theft](
An offline line generated cold wallet where the private key has never been exposed to an Internet connected device is secure, but spending from a cold paper wallet is not terribly practical for transactions. ie you need to generate another cold offline wallet and send the change there. 
As long as your 24 word mnemonic is secure (to physical theft and not stored digitally exposed to malware/iCloud leaks) then your bitcoin are safe.

You're taking about 2FA and specifically a TOTP. This requires your bitcoin to be on a central server where they control the private key (it cannot work on a desktop client where you control the private key). Most online wallets support 2FA for login and many like localbitcoins also require a TOTP (authenticator) to send. 
It is possible on a local desktop client to have a HMAC-CR or HOTP using for example a yubikey. Support would have to be implemented directly into the client software, which at this stage doesn't exist. Only option is to store your wallet in a KeePass or pwsafe vault with 2FA.

If you thought MtGox is a good exchange you've been out of touch for a few years !
What's new is malware specifically targeted at stealing bitcoin wallets, some of these malware are on download.com and sourceforge as binaries and run in PCs and Macs.
I would suggest you generate on an offline machine a series of cold storage wallets.  One way to do this is with a Ubuntu LiveCD.  I used a piper paper wallet generator.
I used a unique BIP38 encryption key for each cold storage wallet, saved these keys in a text file initially,
Then AES encrypted this BIP key list file, and the list of public/BIP38 private keys.
**openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file.txt -out file.enc**
I then deleted the unencrypted files, and exported the encrypted files off the piper.
If you do it that way, your coins should be completely safe, and malware/keystroke logger safe until you load them out of cold storage.

You would need to run armory on 2 computers, one fully online with Bitcoin core and a syncronized armory database. An optional 2nd machine used to generate the private keys. 
A watch only wallet file is created on the offline machine and transferred to the online machine containing the public keys
Transactions are created on the online machine (this is required as it needs the unspent outputs) and this unsigned transaction is transferred to the offline machine for signing via usb drive. This signed transaction is transferred back to the online machine to be broadcast.

Miners verify transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. This is irrespective of whether they include any transactions or not, and whether the included transactions have an attached fee or not. Whether a transaction is mined ahead of others depends on priority, which looks as transaction size (usually the number of inputs) and coin age.

Swedish KNC Miner, which sells servers for mining bitcoin, has pulled in more than half a billion kronor in revenue since its launch last summer. 
This extended operations with a new server for the excavation of another virtual currency, litecoin - a launch that already generated SEK 27 million in revenue.
In mid-February, the Swedish IT company KNC Miner hit the headlines with the news that they would build one of the largest data centers in Constance. The company is therefore the second, after Facebook, Norrbotten who choose to build a giant data center.
An old helicopter hangar at 5,500 square feet is now starting to be filled with KNC Miners specially developed servers that devotes his days to "break" new bitcoin. The virtual currency is produced namely of advanced servers cracking algorithms.
**"We are serving more than three million kronor a day to resell the bitcoin we break ourselves," said Sam Cole**, founder and vice president of KNC Miner with 80 employees and offices on West Higgins Road in central Stockholm.
Besides producing and selling bitcoin feeds KNC Miner to develop, build and sell specialized servers called bitcoinbrytning. The best seller is called Jupiter, which is now being followed up with twice as powerful server Neptune.
"Since the company was founded in June 2013, we had revenues of $ 78 million (half a billion kronor)," said Sam Cole, with his roots in Britain.
On Wednesday, the company rolled out a new line of servers they call Titan. Unlike the company's other products, the Titan server is not focused on bitcoin, but on the other virtual currencies.
"Titan is our first server that focuses solely on scripts basse conditioned virtual currencies Litecoin" said Sam Cole, referring to the currency that is currently the second most popular after bitcoin.
The new servers have been selling like hot cakes. On one day have KNC Miner received over a thousand orders for Titan servers.
"We have confirmed revenues of $ 4.2 million (27 million kronor)," said Sam Cole.
In June it will be time for KNC Miner to close the books for their first year as a company. Sam Cole does not exclude in the first year will be a billion companies.
"We will have over 100 million dollars in revenue (640 million kronor) for KNC Miner Group in late June, I can say with confidence," he says.
KNC Miner AB is based in Stockholm but has all of its revenues in dollars. Even when the company will charge you in bitcoin is careful to immediately switch the virtual currency to U.S. dollars, according to Sam Cole, who founded the company along with three Swedes.
Behind KNC Miner is two companies: Kennemar and Cole (founded Sam Cole and Andreas Kennemar) and ORSoC (founded by Marcus Erlandsson and Michael Unnebäck).

Most businesses accepting bitcoin will use a payment processor like bitpay or coinbase. Overstock for example price their products in $USD, and initially (now 90%) converted 100% of BTC to USD (bitpay offers a guaranteed conversion exchange rate to merchants so they don't lose out if the BTC/USD rate falls). Overstock treats refunds as they do any other payment method, with store credit.

Correct me if i am wrong. 
Ether is not a currency token, it is a FUEL, like a transaction fee to miners for smart contracts, or a service fee to DAO. 
The exact quantity of ether is fairly irrelevant as each is divisible to 10^18
Ether is not destroyed, but is created by miners and ether fuel "fees" are distributed to miners and service providers
Ether is in infinite supply
Ether is NOT designed to be and will never be a cryptographic store of wealth. ie: Alice sells Bob a car in exchange for a higher total in the bitcoin blockchain ledger, and expects that others will be willing to exchange property with her in the future. 
Ether's "intrinsic value" is completely dependent on its underlying utility, which requires adoption of ethereum platform. With infinite supply, if demand doesn't keep up with supply the intrinsic value of each unit will fall.

Agreed. It is easier to hand write a mnemonic wordlist instead of a hexadecimal seed. 
HW-1 currently does NOT support HID keyboard writing the seed on a Raspberry Pi because the text output speed is too fast and saturates the text buffer (Nicolas is aware). Yubikey gets around this by allowing one to configure the character output speed. 
HW-1 can output its hexadecimal seed to an ipad2 with the Camera Conection Kit, or to an iPhone5 (running iOS 8) or retina iPad mini (running iOS 8) with the Lightning to USB camera cable (but not in "notes" app)
I'm not aware of a HW-1 hexadecimal seed to mnemonic string converter, but HW-1 does support BIP32/39/44. You can import your trezor mnemonic onto btchip for example, just no passphrase support on device (Nicolas is aware and I've asked him to add it to the btchip electrum plugin if possible). 
btchip's Python tool `btchipPersoWizard.py` accepts both a Trezor's mnemonic or a btchip hexadecimal seed. The code there, and in ` would be a good place to look. 
The only way to use btchip/HW-1 with an android phone is with Greenaddress chrome app + OTG cable

There is an unreleased third party custom firmware which can dump the bootloader, which can then be analyzed with IDA.

Not really
All you could do is setup a cold wallet, or a series of cold wallets and transfer your coins.
If you are comfortable with the unix command line, what you could do is BIP38 encrypt all of the private keys, save them to a text file (each wallet with a long unique key like "WX7T;ra&lt;8r8CjdL") then encrypt the text file from the command line and shred the password text file so it cannot be recovered. (and the list of BIP38 private keys)
**openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file.txt -out file.enc**
I did exactly this on my piper  from the unix command line.

The answer is nobody knows what 1 bitcoin will be worth tomorrow let alone 3 months from now.  It is also impossible to tell whether another asset class will outperform the BTC/USD spot rate.
I think it is safe to say that bitcoin are *not* synonymous with tickets to the moon, and [we're in uncharted territory with regards to the price cycle](

Tinfoil hat paranoid individuals may not want to setup/initialize BitStash with their everyday computer.  They may want to use a never online airgapped machine.  I tried to initialise my Trezor with a never online [Piper]( (raspberry pi).  To me this is rather like creating a cold paper wallet on a never online airgapped machine, vs turning off wifi on your day-to-day computer and rebooting into Tails.


Does this then introduce an attack vector.  Does the smartphone client need to store a child private key ?

You can QR encode anything you like. 
You can split your mnemonic or hexadecimal seed into fragments with SSSS and QR encode each fragment. 
Just because the ething is on 1mm aluminum, doesn't change the options you have if you were backing up on paper.
Edit : There is a tool called bippy which may achieve what you want. Be aware bippy is not a BIP (Bitcoin improvement proposal), or any sort of standard like AES/SHA256 etc so there is no guarantee 10 years from now you will be able to reverse the bippy encryption.

@_date: 2014-11-29 22:02:30
BTW have you been to ?


Very safe. It is protected in that once initialized and updated to the latest firmware (which `myTrezor` enforces) the seed can never leak out of TREZOR.
The human factor is the 24 word mnemonic backup. A cardboard backup booklet comes with Trezor, as long as you can physically secure that from theft and hackers you're safe. **Never** type it into a computer/text file. Don't type it into a BIP32 website like brain wallet - just to check. 
You can also choose at initialization to protect your Bitcoin with a passphrase, this effectively acts as the 25th word of your mnemonic, so even the mnemonic seed would be useless to a thief. 


Sort of. A cold offline generated seed/mnemonic is one where you generate it offline, and never leak the private key to an Internet connected machine. 
If you had a dedicated offline cold machine dedicated to signing transaction, which you transfer to another machine to broadcast, it remains cold storage. 
TREZOR connects to your online computer, but generates 50% of the initialization ~~mnemonic seed~~ entropy on the Trezor (then combines this with computer entropy to calculate the mnemonic seed in TREZOR). After the mnemonic backup (displayed on TREZOR's screen, not revealed to your computer) the private keys/mnemonic never leave TREZOR, so in practice it is *like* a cold offline signing machine. 


No. TREZOR checks for Satoshilabs signed firmware. I can confirm loading unsigned firmware (which requires you to be on bootloader mode - unplug, hold down both buttons, Replug, click Accept to load new firmware) or downgrading from 1.2.1 firmware will wipe the mnemonic seed. 


Not unless your attacker has unlimited time *and* [the skill of chipworks]( However if you passphrase protected your coins, then you would be immune to this attack vector. If you notice that chipworks has stolen your Trezor you still have time on your side to move your Bitcoin.

After installation, you must set your new bash as default bash in to your system. Homebrew installs bash to `/usr/local/bin/`
Check your current bash version, just echo these variables: `echo $BASH_VERSION` # gives full version
We will use `chsh` command to proceed but before that, we must add this new bash location in to `/etc/shells` Otherwise, system will alert an error. Now, lets edit file:
    sudo nano /etc/shells
add this line at the end of the list:
    /usr/local/bin/bash
Now, we can run `chsh` command: (`whoami`)
    chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash YOUR_USER_NAME
Enter your password to proceed. Now you can **restart Terminal.app** and check if the installation is correct:

**How the Bitcoin Australian Tax office affects BTC Markets**
In August the Australian Tax Office (ATO) released a guidance paper on the tax treatment of Bitcoin transactions and other cryptocurrencies. We have provided answers to some commonly asked questions.
**Will BTC Markets be adding 10% to the total value of each trade?**
The primary business of BTC Markets is to provide an exchange platform for users to buy and sell Bitcoins off each other. BTC Markets does not buy nor sell Bitcoins in its own right therefore we are not liable to collect GST on the value of Bitcoins traded on our marketplace.
**I have a business account do I have to pay GST?**
Businesses who purchase Bitcoins through our marketplace may be liable to pay GST on the full value of bitcoins when they are sold. These businesses may also be entitled to claim GST on this purchase. Businesses are recommended to seek their own independent tax advise.
**Is BTC Markets going to collect GST on trading fees?**
BTC Markets will soon be collecting GST on trading fees for Australian traders. Please be advised this is just on the trading fees and not on total trade value. Below is an example only of 1 Bitcoin traded with a value of $1000 and a trading fee of 1.1% inc GST.
Trading Fee:	$10
GST:	$1
Total inc GST:	$11
**I’m an international trader do I have to pay GST?**
If you are from outside of Australia your trading fee will not include GST.
**Will BTC Markets issue tax invoices?**
In the near future BTC Markets will issue tax invoices when it’s required and when requested.
Please note the information provided above is general in nature and does not take into consideration your personal financial situation. It is for educational purposes only and does not constitute formal financial advice. Remember, the value of any investment can go down as well as up. Before acting, you should consider seeking independent personal financial advice that is tailored to your needs.

Whilst bitcoin wasn't premined, there just weren't many people mining in the early phase and the block reward was too generous, does mining 1 million bitcoin sound like the act of a kind and benevolent father that gave life to cryptocurrency ?  What are Satoshi's intentions with this stash ?

Random errors wont match, but perhaps there are non hashed parts of the file that could be modified.  Time stamps, metadata, creation date, headers, etc.  In a fully decentralised system, if &gt;50% of nodes are saying your blockchain's metadata is wrong, you might assume your copy is wrong.  *if* the above is possible, maybe thousands of blockchain forks could be propagated, even if they contain the exact same transactions and pass the checksums.


Unless the attacker has enough hashrate to recalculate from the changed block and outpace the main chain.


You forget that months of DDOS attacks against pools and months of block witholding attacks is pretty illogical, but it still happens.  BTCGuild's 3-month-luck was dropped from about 102% to &lt;90% over 2 months by such an attack.  Eligius was block witheld by the same attacker.

The problem with that theory is that the trade volume is much lower than it has been previously.  If you look at the 6 month or 2 year view on bitcoinity for bitstamp, the trade volume now is about what it was in Feb *2013* (and much lower than Feb 2014), despite a lower price now than in Feb 2014.
I appreciate bitstamp's mark share has fallen over the past 6 months, but when I looked at the recent trades for bitstamp over the weekend, sometimes there were no trades for 45min - 1 hour.
In line with this price fall, is a decreased network hashrate growth over the past month.  Almost that miners are turning off equipment faster than KnC and Bitmain are delivering ASICs.
Edit : maybe one explanation is that corporates/ETFs/whales are buying off market directly from Bitpay/farm operators/IRC early adopters,  and that retail coinbase customers are off chain buying what they process in sales.

Satoshilabs don't use a payment processor and as such they follow the standard process of waiting 6 confirmations before recognizing the payment as confirmed.  This is not mandatory and sellers can choose the accept 0 or 1 confirmation transactions.
In the case of Bitpay, who have 0% fees, payments are confirmed as soon as the transaction is seen by the network (0 confirmations) and a receipt issued faster then using my NFC credit card with a paypass terminal.
Any vendor is free to signup with bitpay and can choose the fraction of payments in BTC and local currency.

I have gone one step further with my piper
In Keyboard and mouse mode, I created a series of BIP38 password protected vanity wallets
(Like 1m1, 1m2, 1m3 for mining income, or you could use 1g1 for newly generated coins etc)
I then created unique BIP38 passwords for each wallet, and initially saved them in a text file on piper.
I then encrypted the password list, and the keys.txt and keys.db3 files and deleted the plaintext originals off piper, and exported the encrypted keys/passwords file onto brand new USB drives. 
**openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file.txt -out file.enc**
Whether you then wrap these files in an encrypted RAR file, or truecrypt container, and upload to the cloud, or lockup the USB drives in a bank vault. 
Addon : I also created a bip38 test wallet, 1tst and was able to decrypt it with bitaddress.org (offline GitHub copy), import the private key into multibit, and access the coins sent there. 
Addon2: 7zip probably offers equivalent AES protection to Truecrypt 
 Apart from the dangers of temporary files when exploring archives.

There is no built in timer lock in the bitcoin protocol, nor bitcoin service that offer this.
however if you AES encrypted your (BIP38) private keys text file, and AES encrypted your BIP38 passwords. You could commit to memory the BIP38 passwords file decryption password, say something like "she-lyla-phab", then secure deleted the plain text files, then save the encrypted files on USB / physical media. 
If you were to give the encrypted physical media to a lawyer, or lock them up in a bank vault (or find some timelocked online service where the file could not be accessed until a certain date) then nobody will be able to access the BIP38 wallets, not even you.

Electrum is safe to use, with a 12 word seed you have 128 bits of entropy.
Electrum is open source, you can view the code, download from the github repo, and build it yourself from the master source.
Python's random number implementation is safe.
You can also generate a hexadecimal seed of any length outside electrum and import it into electrum to be your seed , ie :


will generate a 12 word seed


will generate a 24 word seed
If you don't want to trust computer generated or electrum generated entropy you can generate your own seed, using dice, coin flips, multiple entropy sources, etc

bitpay removed their 1% fee for their basic plan several months ago.
My experience with black friday/cyber monday is that payments were processed in seconds both through coinbase and bitpay shopping carts.  This was having trasferred funds to breadwallet (so the funds were 0-confirmation in breadwallet), I was able to make payments from breadwallet and receive a bitpay/coinbase receipt within seconds.  Obviously no confirmations, but bitpay accepts 0-confirmation payments with no double spend risk to the merchant.
Personally I operate a coinkite POS terminal, and it also can print out a receipt on 0/1/6 confirmations however you choose.

Correct. Multibit HD is a complete rewrite the HD support and a completely different GUI. It will not be backward compatible so the transition will require you to send all of your coins.  All desktop wallets will need you to send your funds to a private-key-only-on-Trezor wallet
Given the above, and that there are no desktop wallets currently supporting Trezor (apart from the electrum github fork) I might just use mytrezor exclusively.

People only became aware of the selfish mining attack, and the block witholding attack vectors because of publicly released academic papers. I don't see why a bad-full-node attack wouldn't work. Currently there are 7000 full nodes, each with a copy of the blockchain, and a bitcoinQT following a certain set of rules. If there were say 7001 bad nodes running either a modified bitcoinQT and/or a modified blockchain, that could be a very cheap attack. (I believe to submit an alternative blockchain the attacker would still need a massive amount of hashrate to retrospectively change a past block, then catchup by recalculating subsequent blocks on their own fork, although a modified QT might be coded to make this easier for them, or they might have a vulnerability in SHA256)

Fee Schedule
Independent Reserve does not collect GST on the value of Bitcoin bought or sold.
The ATO have recently released guidance on Bitcoin treatment under GST, which may require Australian suppliers of Bitcoin to charge GST on the supply of Bitcoin in some circumstances. Independent Reserve provides an open marketplace for buyers and sellers, and does not buy or sell Bitcoin in its own right. Therefore we are not required to collect GST on the value of Bitcoin traded.
Independent Reserve does include GST as part of the brokerage fee charged to Australian customers, however this GST is absorbed within the standard 0.5 % trading fee and ultimately paid out of our own profits.
Trade commission	0.5 % flat rate
BPAY deposits	BPAY deposits of AUD 100.00 and above are free

This topic might help 
~~I don't think coinkite are helping themselves by changing the terminal price so much. It was "half price" for 0.5btc on Black Friday, then gradually rose to 1.25btc, then was 0.7btc a few weeks ago, and is well over 1btc again.~~
One the positive side they charge no fees to recieve bitcoin and no ongoing fees for the terminal. You only pay 1% to withdraw your coins if you have a free account, or with the $10/month account you pay no withdrawal fees. 
Edit : Coinkite are extremely responsive to customer email feedback - within a day of suggesting they fix their terminal price in fiat (with a dynamic BTC price) they've done so. A+++

Technical info
Transaction priority is calculated as a value-weighted sum of input age, divided by transaction size in bytes:
    priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytes
Transactions need to have a priority above 57,600,000 to avoid the enforced limit (as of client version 0.3.21). This threshold is written in the code as COIN * 144 / 250, suggesting that the threshold represents a one day old, 1 btc coin (144 is the expected number of blocks per day) and a transaction size of 250 bytes.
So, for example, a transaction that has 2 inputs, one of 5 btc with 10 confirmations, and one of 2 btc with 3 confirmations, and has a size of 500bytes, will have a priority of
    (500000000 * 10 + 200000000 * 3) / 500 = 11,200,000

I really really like my piper. I bought it months ago as a stopgap whilst waiting for Trezor and am still waiting for Trezor. 
A few things : 
* it is only safe if you keep it offline and don't connect it to the Internet after generating your private keys
* one way to prove to yourself the keys are randomly generated and not deterministally generated is to either use the included bitaddress, or to use a short prefix for the piperGUI (which uses vanitygen)
* if you have generated private keys on piper (either bip38 encrypted or unencrypted) then they will stay on piper unless you chose "forget" or run the deletion script. 




* You could use the command line to AES encrypt the private keys, then shred the plaintext sources, then copy the encrypted files to a brand new never used USB, then run the deletion script. 
* Another option would be to eject piper's SD card and lock it up in a safe place or to format/wipe/destroy the SD card
* Piper's thermal paper won't last forever. This photo is after one month on my window sill, mostly in the shade

Investing in bitcoin is high risk and you should not invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose.
Investing in hardware preorders is far more risky as these are preorders of products which do not yet exist, from startup companies, essentially you bankrolling their R&amp;D.  Cointerra only have prototype hardware despite selling their first batch as December delivery.  They are providing weekly progress updates, but have only achieved 80% of their target hashrate.
Other companies taking preorders are BFL (delivered 9-12 months post taking preorder payment), Hashfast (only a handful of units shipped despite being 3 months late), VMC (no hardware shipments)
Your best chance is with hardware shipping immediately from stock - either bitfury or antminer.  BFL still have not yet delivered their pre christmas sale "immediate shipping, in stock" orders.

Escrow is no bad thing for you as a buyer. None the less LBC escrow is only for online sales. If you meet in person for a cash trade there is no escrow. There is no way to message someone on LBC without creating a trade request (which you can cancel) to ask for an in person trade. Note don't abuse that because the sellers coins will be locked in escrow until you cancel ir complete the trade request. 
Sellers often have multiple advertisements at different prices, cash deposit, specific bank, cash trade etc. if so, use the correct ad.

What happens if you forget the passwords ?
What steps did you take to prevent somebody undeleting your multibit wallet that you moved to the USB drive ?
What if later you decide you want additional cold wallets (so you can sweep one at a time later) are you going to buy another USB drive and do it all again ?

If you wish to entirely eliminate the memory component (plaintext seed, or a plaintext private key, or an encrypted BIP38 wallet and plaintext password) 
Whichever way you are likely to make multiple clones in case one is damaged. 
If you choose BIP38/plain text password, and make multiple clones, won't you lose sleep knowing that a thief could sweep your wallet ?
The keepass + Yubikey HOTP will effectively self destruct. Every time the attacker presses the Yubikey's button the hardware counter advances by one. Depending on how far you set the read ahead, you can control how many attempts they get.

They call a Rasperry Pi a notebook the size of a Nokia phone, and don't point out that 125 Euros is not an appropriate markup for a Pi running open source software, for example. No mention that Trezor is available now for $79 (for slush pool beta users) and incorrectly implies that Trezor PIN is limited to 4 digits.

I appreciate your concept is to remove complexity and all non-essential functions/interfaces, and that a GSM-enabled device is aiming at a different user case scenario, however data roaming charges are real and obscenely expensive
I have wondered about how to spend bitcoin when travelling overseas, probably the easiest answer is to buy a local SIM card with 1 month data (they're cheap in SE Asia) but in Europe, they may not work across borders.
My coinkite POS terminal has world GSM which works well, even for firmware updates, so a signing device with world GSM could be very useful for frequent travellers.  (Andreas says his credit cards often get blocked because his frequent country hopping looks suspicious to the banks).

I like the idea of a never online piper + Trezor.  Piper includes a Linux distro on a raspberry Pi with electrum and vanity gen. I see this as a better option than booting off a liveCD or buying a new offline net book. Furthermore Trezor will support multibit HD, armory and electrum, so I see no reason why the piper electrum client couldn't be upgraded. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 08:22:51
You can buy with a cash bank deposit
Localbitcoins (if you use it properly) requires the seller to fund their account up to their maximum sell amount in advance.  Once you make an offer to buy those bitcoin are locked in escrow for 90 mins.  Assuming you make it to the bank in that time frame, **make sure you click on Mark As Paid**.  That will lock the seller's bitcoin in escrow until they release them to you (once they have confirmed the payment)
If you do NOT log in to LBC and mark the trade as paid, the trade is cancelled and the BTC are returned to the seller.
Also, only choose reputable sellers, don't exchange mobile phone numbers, addresses, don't open any website links or attachments they send you.  Some sellers might ask for you to upload a deposit receipt or photo ID, as a minor you should probably avoid those sellers.  ONLY agree to send personal ID to &gt;100+confirmed trades, Protrader with 100% positive feedback, and ONLY if they have listed that in the sell advertisement as a condition of sale.
If you do choose to meet a seller in person, they will likely ask you for your mobile number, again the above screening criteria apply, do it in a public place like a busy shopping centre, go with a friend.

Is this the project posted to reddit a few weeks back with an amazing card containing battery, CPU, etc ? These cards would not be cheap (my mass produced yubikey costs $25.  If the card contains the private key it can be stolen. Even Trezor is susceptible to a hardware jtag flash recovery. 
 (and 10min, and 19:30) stick says the reason Trezor includes a display is so the user can confirm the transaction to be signed by Trezor matches the transaction shown on the client. A smart card does not have this feature. 
Edit :  is the discussion re JTag and hackers retrieving the private key from a lost/stolen Trezor. Stick says the physical attack should take several weeks, so move your coins as soon as you lose your Trezor.

I've deliberately sent 2 dozen 0 fee transactions over the past week. Partly to test my hack of multibit, and the rest through electrum. 
All went through within 1-2 blocks, but they were all "oldish" coins. No movement for many months. Electrum seem to be quite intelligent with the transaction fee. It won't let you send a 0 fee transaction where it is against the rules (small value, recently moved coins) but will allow it for older coins.

Good suggestion. 
[This will get you started](
The main options are:
* offline generated cold paper wallet +/- BIP38
* offline generated m of n Multisig HD wallet (eg Armory lockbox or electrum multisig)
* offline generated HD wallet (like electrum or Armory)
* "services" like xapo vault, although generally you don't control the keys - so you have to trust them
* multisig "services" that allow you to provide your own private keys, which potentially could be generated offline (Coinkite multisig, ~~coinbase multisig vault~~ edit: I think coinbase multisig vault generates keys in your web browser, so you still need to trust them)
* lukewarm offline hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger / HW1, these devices can generate their seed *on device* and *after* initialization/backup, they never leak the seed to your online computer.

I have very occasionally had problems with "transaction id not found" errors when sending funds with multibit. I think it occurs when multibit is left running when your machine goes to sleep and you send funds without close/reopen multibit. 
If it has been a long time and the transaction is not seen on the blockchain, check you wallet balance on blockchain.info
If it still has the original pre-send balance, resync your multibit wallet from say 2012 (choose a daye well before your first transaction). This should get you back to the correct balance as shown on blockchain.info and you can try again.

Going back to you post at the top of this tree, you either store your private key or seed unencrypted safely, or you encrypt it and safely store the password. 
There are countless ways you can store something with redundancy, multiple physical copies, but if they're unencrypted are you going to know if one copy gets stolen ?  You could hide them in plain sight with steganography, or use Shamir's shared secrets, or use a multisig wallet, or use a truecrypt or similar volume with part of the password a keyfile or yubikey.
I think a long difficult to brute force but memorable password is the way to go. YMMV.

Given your security model, I now think it is more important than ever that users are "forced" to confirm their mnemonic. Edit: IIRC electrum and Multibit HD force the user to re type the mnemonic. 
3 incorrect PINs : device wipe
Firmware upgrade : requires blank device
This was a conscious design choice for security, but a completely different choice to Yubikey with factory locked firmware. ~~If for example Trezor had  an exploitable official firmware release, a thief could downgrade to that version to enable the exploit whilst preserving the device's seed.~~
From what I gather users cannot easily downgrade Ledger/HW1 firmware and you have the ability to blacklist exploitable firmware.

10 minute block times over a p2p network is a practical solution to the [Byzantine General's problem](






























**And in the [words of Satoshi himself](










proofs-of-work.  **Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the 
proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time.**  They had to all have seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.  **If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.**

Whether you store one BIP38 encrypted private key, or a deterministic tree of private keys, the cold storage companies require an encrypted private key. 
If you store an unencrypted seed or key pair on paper/usb they your funds can be swept by anyone who accesses your copy/copies.
Plus these copies are susceptible to fire / water and rat's teeth

One button cold wallet generation.  Plug in a USB and you have a backup. (There is a forget or store wallets flip switch) 
**OPTIONALLY** If you want more, add a keyboard, mouse and display. You can then use bitaddress, customize vanitygen, add your own entropy, choose your own BIP38 password, run the delete stored wallets script (or shred the stored wallets DB), AES encrypt the BIP38 stored addresses and then shred the plaintext, download the firmware and wipe the ISO on the sdcard.
The options are endless.

The source code is on Github, there are 77 contributors and 394 people have starred the project. The instructions to download the repo and build it for unix/Mac and Windows are there (and are pretty simple for OSX - download the command line tools, brew, python, install electrum).

You're absolutely incorrect. I've been a bitcoiner for about 10 months, but am an enthusiast, a miner, a localbitcoins protrader, and a small business owner that accepts bitcoin.  I do what I can to support the bitcoin payment economy with Trezor, Piper, stickers, changetip, etc and I build my own electrum from the github repo.  
I wasn't around for the pre Q4/2013 bubbles, and chose the Feb 2014 comparison window because bitcoinity only offers 3m / 6m / 2yr time spans (and bitcoinwisdom is too complicated).  I didn't think Feb 2014 was a statistically unfair comparison as the bull run to $1200 ATH started in Nov/Dec 2013.
You have to admit - we're *not* cruising, bitstamp trade volumes are falling by any metric.  Hashrate (this past month) is falling from an ATH of about 150PH to 135PH now. edit : the number of full nodes is falling, the hashrate % of public pools like btcguild/slush/eligius/bitminter is in rapid decline.
Who would have predicted that with Dell, Expedia, Newegg, Tigerdirect, and Overstock already accepting bitcoin that volumes and price would be falling.  
Plus we've had the completion of the Marshall's auction with multiple unsuccessful ETF bidders, pantera/second market/etc on the verge of entering the market, and the mass delivery of Gen2 bitmaintech and Gen2 KnC ASICs.
I am risk averse, conservative, and share some sentiment with [Gavin that bitcoin is a grand experiment](


What is the penetration of bitcoin ?  How big is the bitcoin economy ?
[there are 5059 businesses listed on coinmap](
[Bitpay is processing $1 million per day]( and with Coinbase they serve 30,000 businesses
Blockchain hosts [1.9 million wallets.](
Coinbase has [1.5 million active wallets](
But on the other hand, how many (on chain) bitcoin wallets have a non-zero non-dust balance ? = [907,760](
China has a population of [1.38 billion]( yet maybe there are only [50,000 Chinese bitcoiners](
Philippines has a population of [100 million]( there have been [many recent reddit posts by Filipinos]( yet they only have [2300 members of the bitcoin PH facebook page](

Chris is a one man operation and email replies (and shipping) are slow however. It took probably more than 3 weeks to arrive down under, but I bought it as a stop gap whilst waiting (and still waiting) for Trezor.

Bitcoin security is hard, I think Trezor is the most promising solution available.  Apparently the classic (white/plastic) preorders are already in the mail, and the general public store should be open very soon
What trezor does it it moves the private keys security off your machine, it never leave trezor (assuming you don't enter your seed into an online computer/phone, take a photo that gets uploaded to iCloud, etc.) and you can safely send from your everyday online computer.
Trezor is still potentially vulnerable to physical reverse engineering attacks, but these attacks probably take weeks.  Hopefully you would notice your trezor is missing in time.

Old coins (not moved for many months) will not need a fee, more recently moved coins will need a fee
The best solution I have found is electrum, it automatically calculates the transaction fee for you, but it allows you to set a 0 fee transaction and will warn you if your transaction won't propagate at 0 fee.
Other clients are much more stupid, either allowing 0 fee transactions which won't propagate, or forcing the old 0.0001 btc x transaction rounded up in Kb

I haven't looked through your code commits in detail, but I believe you are hashing the key file with the user password to encode the wallet.dat
Presumably there is no provision for [process memory protection]( as electrum is not designed with the security goals of keepass/pwsafe/truecrypt etc.  
On the one hand it is better than nothing, on the other hand it might break backwards compatibility and lead to a false sense of security.  I presume it couldn't be coded as an optional plugin, as electrum is not designed with 2fa in mind.

This concept does not improve on security over Trezor. 
1. Your wifi/broadcasting shield (currently) communicates with the cold device via Ethernet, so the cold device is not really cold
2. You're running a raspberry OS (in the concept) too complex to security audit, even openssl itself is too complex to audit
3. You're carrying a smartphone anyway, who isn't these days ? Are you going to tether your broadcasting device to your phone or use the Cafe's wifi ?
This solution, even if it were more compact is far too slow and clunky for use in a coffee shop, [people want NFC tap and go speed, with 0 confirmations.]( Not tether your device/plug in OTG cable, load wallet, enter your PIN, enter your passphrase, confirm, confirm.

Actually no. Trezor is designed to not require a trusted machine and can be used in an Internet cafe. The client fashions the transaction, sends it to Trezor for signing, and Trezor displays the transaction on its screen so you can confirm it is correct. The part I don't yet understand is how you can enter your pin code on the untrusted computer, but we will find out soon enough.
In any case the pin's main feature is to protect you from a 3rd party using your Trezor if you misplace it. Trezor also generates a one time password that needs to be entered for each pin entry (and lengthens the lockout time with incorrect attempts) to resist brute forcing the pin. 
Trezor *still* requires an offline trusted computer to do the first initialization, to setup the seed and pin. For example features to be offered are HD hierarchical wallets, BIP 38 encrypted seeds, 12 vs 24 word seeds, supplemental user entropy from the client, multi signature, and shared secrets (not all features in the initial firmware release)

Perhaps coinjar do not have a stored exchange rate, and dynamically generate it on demand. When I click "filler" on their site, it does a lookup of the USD/BTC spot price, then does a AUD/BTC spot price conversion, then gives slightly different coinjar AUD/BTC rate.

It would be fantastic if every major international airport had a Bitcoin ATM, convert when you get there.

In addition to tree structure, you would need to change wordlist. 
I think for archival purposes having mnemonic intercompatibility is important. Electrum 2 solves this by supporting multiple mnemonic seed versions in their default_wallet file, electrum knows which mnemonic type to use from the seed version number. 
We're all still early adopters. I could make the the same argument for changing to interoperable mnemonics as you do for enforcing 'bits' in breadwallet.

How is this not a pyramid scheme ?


**What is a pyramid scheme?**
Pyramid schemes are illegal and very risky ‘get-rich-quick’ schemes that can cost a lot of people a lot of money.
Promoters at the top of the pyramid make their money by having people join the scheme. Then they pocket the fees and other payments made by those who join under them.
In a typical pyramid scheme, a member pays to join. The only way for the member to ever recover any money is to convince other people to join up and to part with their money as well.
In contrast, people in legitimate multi-level marketing earn money by selling genuine products to consumers, not from the recruiting process. Be aware though, some pyramid scheme promoters disguise their true purpose by introducing products that are overpriced, of poor quality, difficult to sell or of little value. Making money out of recruitment is still their main aim.
People often hear about pyramid schemes from friends, family or neighbours. Normally, pyramid schemes recruit members at seminars, home meetings, over the phone or even by mail. Now email, usually as spam, is increasingly used to recruit members as well.
For the scheme to work so that everyone can make a profit there would have to be an endless supply of new members. In reality, the number of people willing to join the scheme (and therefore, the amount of money coming into the scheme) dries up very quickly. When the pyramid collapses (and they all do) relationships, friendships and even marriages can be destroyed over money lost in the scam.
In Australia, it is against the law not only to promote a pyramid scheme, but even to participate in one.

tl;dr Piper is awesome, I have made many posts about it.
The latest firmware is even better, it contains electrum 1.98, armory, bitaddress, altcoin support, BIP32 support, Shamir's secret sharing (although this last feature is buggy)
* Piper's special long life thermal paper won't last forever. This photo is after one month on my window sill, mostly in the shade
* This after 3 months on the same window sill
* No problems with the printouts stored inside in the open, or those in closed drawers (yet)
* one way to prove to yourself the keys are randomly generated and not deterministally generated is to either use the included bitaddress, or to use a short prefix for the piperGUI (which uses vanitygen)
Bitcoin wallets are moving to HD wallets (bip32) which is now supported by Piper's GUI, as well as the onboard electrum and armory.

Greenaddress+Btchip HW-1 lets you store on device either the 1of2 mnemonic (generated by the online chrome app) or a hexadecimal seed (generated on Btchip)


The private 1of2 mnemonic or seed is stored on the SmartCard of the HW-1
I haven't reviewed the code or the white paper in detail 
The optional PIN quick login feature when *not* using HW-1 I believe stores *your* private mnemonic, encrypted on *their* server, which is then sent back to you if you enter the correct PIN (in order to let your login without needing to type in your mnemonic to do so)
HW-1 works differently in that to login, you insert the HW-1 and authenticate with the HW-1's PIN


In theory no.  The SmartCard design is like trezor's philosophy. After initialisation (when you backup the mnemonic or seed) the mnemonic or seed never leaves the SmardCard. There is an element of trust required at initialization the the ChromeApp doesn't leak/steal the browser generated mnemonic; but the code is entirely open source. I can confirm you can download the chrome Crx repo from github and run that, as a seperate extension than the one downloaded from google's store. 
Choosing the hexadecimal 1of2 seed *should* generate the private seed on HW-1 and not in the browser. 
Greenaddress have a newish feature where you can create your own 3of3 multisig fragments which I think combines *both* 2of2 fragments and you can use these fragments to completely control your Bitcoin even if greenaddress were to disappear. This presumably is NOT supported with HW-1 if the mnemonic/seed never leaves the device after initialization.
Greenaddress makes things somewhat confusing
Initialise = generates your own 1of2 Mnemonic. 
Add a PIN to your account = you get another mnenonic
Create 3of3 recovery fragments (of which you can create more than 3 WTF?!) = each fragment is a different mnemonic. 


I haven't loaded my wallet to check. I don't know if it is every transaction, how often it is sent to you, and how much manual intervention is required. Do you need to manually resend the ntimelock transaction every few weeks ? No idea.

I'm working on a shell script that downloads everything you could possibly need for a cold offline Rasperry Pi
All you need is a $40 Pi, a $5 SD card, BKO keyboard/mouse/display/Ethernet connection
Download the script, install everything from Trezor/Ledger/electrum/armory/bitaddress/qr code generator/SSSS/BIP39 scripts/etc
Then disconnect the Ethernet cable, and never connect the Pi again to the net. (Or of you do so, use a new SD card and run the shell script again)
Would that be helpful ?

I agree that Trezor is only cool/tepid storage not strictly cold storage. However it's design is such that unless you are [chipworks]( the private key will never leak from Trezor. 
I applaud you on your project and innovation. I just think your concept is flawed. There are many things Trezor could have included - battery, NFC, wifi, touch screen, etc. they deliberately chose to write their own boot loader, firmware, browser plugin, etc. 
What we all want is bitcoin to go mainstream. The solution is to make payments fast, simple, cheap, with rapid confirmation and little danger from theft by hackers. It needs to me as quick and fast as visa/MasterCard/Amex/apple pay at the point of sale - see youtube link.

I use a piper that will never be connected to the Internet, and attach a keyboard, mouse and monitor. 
This allows access to the python GUI vanitygen engine, and to Bitaddress. 
I use the GUI vanitygen with a custom wallet prefix, with each wallet having a unique BIP38 encryption key. 
Piper can optionally save or forget generated keys, I command line AES encrypt the wallet database file, then shred the database file (piper has a deletion script also). 
I save the AES encrypted files on to a brand new USB drive, and truecrypt it on my laptop, and back it up online.

~~I've sent Rodolfo a email regarding a **major** issue for non-USD merchants.  Coinkite only offers UK/AU/JP merchants the MtGox and Coinkite exchange rate for bitcoin, and for AUD the coinkite rate=MtGox rate.~~
~~This is terrible news because I need a 10% adjustment to the MtGox rate to correct it down to the coinjar price, which is pretty similar to the bitstamp_in_AUD exchange rate.~~ coinkite now offer 4 AUD/BTC exchange rates, plus additional options for UK and JP. 
The coinkite terminal has 2 modes - "Basic retail POS" and "buy and sell BTC/LTC".  I see no reason for coinkite charge me any fees for setting my own exchange rate in basic retail mode, but 




~~So basically I am being charged a 50% fee of the 10% price adjustment because they *only* offer my business the MtGox rate to accept bitcoin.~~
Edit : just looked up the CAD exchange rate options offered by coinkite , MtGox CAD/BTC = 1046.956, VirtEx = 887, Coinkite rate 966.98
Edit 2: rodolfo the best options would be a) the bitpay exchange rate in AUD  b) the coinjar rate, or c) the bitstamp rate converted to AUD 
And remove the 50% coinkite tax on exchange rates adjustment for Retail POS users as this is neither fair nor listed in your pricing or Terminal FAQ.
Edit 3: solved, bitpay exchange rate now available !

I've been having great fun playing with the electrum console, and thought I would share :-)
You can generate your own 12 word electrum seed from the command line with the following


for example : f6e257d7f51e2145bc2e2ad14fdd39d6  (note anything longer than a 12 word seed will not hex import in electrum generation 2.x)
Then from the Electrum console window (or running python from the command line)




Results in the mnemonic ['dear', 'tap', 'dove', 'flutter', 'person', 'door', 'sane', 'world', 'express', 'effort', 'won', 'blossom']
On the other hand, if you have already generated a mnemonic seed in electrum, it is stored in the wallet file as hexcode in the field 'seed': 'mnemonic_to_hex'  
If you have encrypted your electrum wallet, then it will also be in the wallet file 'use_encryption': True, 'seed': 'AES_ENC_SEED'
(note AES encryption produces a different output for the same input each time)
From the electrum console you can decode the AES_ENC_SEED with 


This will give you the hexcode result, for example f6e257d7f51e2145bc2e2ad14fdd39d6 
Then you can run that through the console


Side note : I have also been playing with Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme from the command line
Edit : there does not appear to be any way to wipe the electrum console buffer, so don't type your secret password in there ! Use python from the command line instead. 
Edit2 : If you have installed electrum from the command line, ie : homebrew on OSX, then extracted electrum source, then **sudo python setup.py install** you will be able to use from the command line **electrum getseed** to display your mnemonic seed and hexadecimal seed.  
Edit3: You can type **getseed()** from the electrum console. (the output is not saved in the console buffer) 
If you have encrypted your wallet, you will be asked the password first.  
You can also type **wallet.storage.get('seed')** to display the encrypted seed

The unit is very convenient in that you can create a new cold wallet with one button, and if you have the save keys switch on, your saved keys will be saved automatically to USB insert a thumb drive.  You wouldn't just rely on the thermal print out, but you cold also photocopy your printout or plug in a USB printer. 
With a keyboard/mouse/display you can configure vanitygen to use a wallet prefix, BIP38 password, and you can run the deletion script to wipe the saved keys.

I would say this would last longer than any paper/wood/plastic or aluminum cold storage wallet. 
I am waiting for Trezor and electrum 2.0 before I order mine. You don't have to limit yourself to a bip38 cold wallet, you could for example cold store an encrypted electrum seed, however note 18 years from now it will probably be trivial to brute force a weak AES password, the same password encrypted with BIP38 is perhaps "100 billion" times more secure.

\&gt; $1000 : cold offline storage, protected by BIP38, generated on an offline machine.  Keep smaller "spending" amounts in a separate wallet, so you don't need to convert your cold wallet into a hot wallet.  Electrum or Armory are suitable desktop clients once again.

The website allows the retailer to setup a "cashier's card" for which you can use any magnetic card you own. You can then choose to enable  these three options
1. Require a cashier's card to do anything at the terminal. A card will be required at startup and before any usage, even for transactions not involving the merchant, such as Coinkite card-holder functions.
2. Require a cashier's card to remove funds from merchant's account. This is strongly recommended, unless perhaps the terminal is kept under lock and key.
3. Require a cashier's card to make a bill. This also enables a shortcut: swipe at main menu to start making a bill.

No a paper wallet is ideally a public/private key pair generated on a trusted machine that has and will never connect to the Internet.  would be good for newbies as long as you realize the thermal printer is for convenience. You can print or photocopy onto ink/paper. 
A brain wallet is a memorable human phrase/verse/lyric hashed into a private key, and susceptible to a "dictionary" style attack. 
A BIP 39 or electrum seed is a **randomly** generated sequence of entropy used to generate a private key or hierarchical wallet.

If every device has identical firmware, and no records are kept of which security card matches what dongle, (and if the 4 digit security check is done on-dongle) then you most likely cannot link shipping address to account balances. 
However this means every dongle is individually unique, and if the firmware supported a "what is your security card seed" query then each device could be identified. I don't have a major issue with that, all yubikey's have a unique serial number. 
This might change if one could assign your own security card seed and print your own like [passwordcard.](

Ive not used Gyft, but there is no official BTC/USD exchange rate by which you could judge whether you have over or under paid by $0.35
Bitstamp may be one dominant exchange in determining price, 
There are also many composite indexes which factor in the price across multiple sites/exchanges.
The bitpay exchange rate updates every minute. 
I read a deflationary argument recently about "why spend bitcoin today, when they'll be worth more tomorrow/next month/next year?".  The same is true about about the falling price of electronics goods, computers, tablets, smartphones, flash memory, cameras, TVs, flat screens, and probably also cars, airfares, home appliances.

I recently travelled by plane interstate, only to discover I have left my mobile in my car at the airport. I was locked out of my bitcoin exchanges (and if somebody had broken into my car and stolen the phone, it would have been permenantly)
The yubikey appears to be injection moulded around the PCB, which means it doesn't look shiny or polished, but is solid plastic and would be impossible to interfere with without completely destroying it.  I believe they've sold tens-hundreds of millions of them, and I haven't read complaints of them breaking.

If ghash can destroy the whole deck of cards then bitcoin is doomed. 
Are pools like bitminter, btcguild, slush, eligius and ozcoin on the endangered list ? Absolutely. 
Ghash is bigger than the above 5 pools combined. 
Throw in a few months of block withholding against Guild and Eligius, and you have a recipe for the situation we find ourselves in. 
Con of cgminer came up with my favourite endgame of block withholding. 
Unfortunately the *ahem* foundation does not seem to grasp the most basic comprehension of how fatal centralisation is in a zero-trust-consensus-based peer-to-peer network. 


Are we talking about the same rational actors who have DDOS attacked Guild and Eligius for 6 months ? Who block withheld both pools probably thousands of btc ? Who slashed their 2% fee to 0% despite achieving 51% of the network ?
I would like to think that our mysterious creator would turn in his exile if he saw the current state of centralisation, but in reality he probably never foresaw pooled mining. 


try to rephrase it in that context.


King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a certain 
number of characters in length.  Once they stimulate the network to generate a 
packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and 
erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble.  They 
only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack 
at the same time.


 It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time, and 
whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time.  The problem is 
that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different 
attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear 
the other first.


receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an 
extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its 
hash.  The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of 
them all working at once before one of them finds a solution.  Once one of the 
generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone 
changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work 
in the hash they're working on.  If anyone was working on a different attack 
time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.


proofs-of-work.  ****Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the 
proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was 
expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers 
to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time.****  They had to all have 
seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.  If the CPU 
power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, 
they can safely attack at the agreed time.


and global view problems you've asked about are solved.

I don't want to sound overly critical, I would love to see competing secure solutions in the ecosystem to drive improvements, fewer lost or stolen bitcoins and lower prices.


It would be preferable to be able to setup/initialise the device offline, although this may be problematic if your security design prevents firmware flashing (paranoid individuals may want to flash the device when it arrives via post in case it was intercepted and evil firmware installed after it left the factory). 
Instead of using random.org why not just let people enter their own entropy like bitaddress ?  
TREZOR for example allows fully [offline firmware flashing and initialisation](  and [user provided entropy](
Where does bitstash store the private keys ? On a LUKS protected SD card ? Hence my question about disassembly. If an attacker which physical access can disassemble bitstash, clone the SD card, maybe install physical radios/back doors, and reassemble - how will users know ?
Apple's TouchID and [Trezor claim to store then private data on the CPU]( Such areas may be [vulnerable to chipworks]( but are more protected than a removable SD card.

BIP38 uses scrypt and is very difficult to brute force


I believe cryo card steel wallets are the most durable offering in the marketplace for storing BIP38 encrypted private keys or AES encrypted electrum seeds. 
You still need to store your BIP38 password.  An option is to use keepass or pwsafe and a Yubikey for a client-side One Time Password (HOTP) or Challenge Response (HMAC), combined with something you've memorised.  You can make multiple copies of the Yubikey.
(see the sourceforge discussion link)
You could also use Shamir's Secret Sharing
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:21:35
The HD in multibit stands for Hierarchical Deterministic. That means all generated addresses can be derived from your seed.

@_date: 2014-07-04 00:39:32
The short answer is that for Time Based 2fa to work properly you need an online trusted 3rd party.
This is a long but brilliant post about Yubikey. 










One option is to place your electrum wallet (with encrypted seed) in an encrypted container with keepass or password safe. Apparently Challenge Response (pwsafe) communicates over HID so is not susceptible to a standard keyloggers (that a static password would be). There is a Hardware One Time Password plugin for keepass (which runs well on OSX + brew + wine + mono) which does not need an online certifying authority (that TOTP/google authenticator needs), but can easily get out of sync if you don't set the read ahead far enough. 
Edit : You could fork electrum to include HOTP or HMAC client-side 2fa.
Hopefully within the next month or so, 2fa with Trezor will become available to everyone. 
For this to work the private key must never leave Trezor (except for your offline secret backup of the seed).  SSSS is also available under brew.

I'm all for [external security audits]( and would love to see one of Trezor's hardware/firmware
Trezor now has [stack overflow protection]( who knows whether there was a viable attack vector prior to that commit. 
My belief in Trezor is that no remote attack vulnerability is possible whereby malware can intercept, download, extract my private key from Trezor. If you have any vulnerabilities in mind I would be interested to hear your thoughts. 
Attackers with physical access to the device, and unlimited time could extract your private seed but hopefully such an attack is time consuming taking days to weeks, and gives you time to move your funds before the thief can.   Game consoles have custom hardware, bootloaders, firmware, signed applications but are still hacked, only for "mandatory" firmware upgrades and [non downgradable firmware sealing holes](
@_date: 2014-12-02 06:17:29
I assume you are keeping the electrum private seed on the SD card, and the SSS shares are your backup ?
One problem with a Raspberry Pi is the SD card can be easily removed by a thief.  This would mean you need to keep the SD card safely under lock and key.  The Pi's SD card reader may wear out if you do this frequently.
Also how are you planning to delete the SSS share fragments after you've created them ?

I think that is FUD. Trezor's microcontroller could potentially leak the private key if your attacker had unlimited time, resources and the technical ability of [chipworks]( but all of that would be for nothing if you protected your bitcoin with a passphrase. 
HW1 is closed source and proprietary. They claim to be safer than a microcontroller, but [don't claim to be uncrackable](

The terminals themselves have 3G inbuilt, so you can pay with your favourite smartphone app via QR code and the terminal will be updated with the transaction status.
Unless there is a coinkite terminal at a venue or exchange you frequent, the cards don't save you much time. Coinkite starter accounts are now free, and work well with one, but are not mandatory.

Depends how much you want to spend. A cold offline generated paper wallet is almost free. If you are willing to spend money your could buy an offline signing device like a raspberry Pi ($35) or a mycelium entropy (unreleased).

Localbitcoins will often give you a better rate than coinjar. LBC charge advertisers (in your case the sellers) so the list price is what you get. Coinjar take 2% commission ofyour purchase. 
Choose a reputable LBC seller, 100% positive feedback, online transfer or local bank deposit and you will be safe (with escrow). They might ask for a photo of your driver's license as you are new. For beginners stay away from foreign sellers wanting perfect money, etc. people listing sale in AUD with western union are most likely NOT in australia, so you will have additional western union fees to send the funds overseas. 
2 factor authentication is essential, and dont store more than a handful of bitcoin on a web wallet, move them offline.

To clarify, you should never trust your unencrypted private key or seed to a 3rd party. 
If you generate your seed with an offline computer that will never connect to the internet (or secure wipe it, or use a tails boot cd, etc) then your seed is never revealed to anybody else. Furthermore the electrum source code is on GitHub in Python which is much easier to read than C. 
You could have the encrypted electrum seed laser etched on a physical cold wallet such as a wood wallet or a steel wallet (provided they allow an 88 character string)
Edit: the electrum wallet is simply a plain text file with the field 'seed': 'ABCDEFG'. 
You could easily restore the seed by scanning the string's QR code and pasting it in the wallet text file. This could all be done on an offline machine, then used for offline signing transactions.

It is simple but requires you to us chrome, preferably the latest generation (v38) and to download greenaddress as an extension. 
That last bit is slightly annoying for OSX as it looks like chrome operation system starting to encroach on OSX. These new CRX CHrome apps add their own launcher icon to the dock. You also need to setup 2fa, if you choose authenticator as your 2fa make sure you backup your 2fa seed. 
It is however easy to use and by far easier to setup that the alternatives. HW1 lets you generate your half of the 2 of 2 seed on btchip itself (you can use either the greenaddress generated mnemonic OR the HW1 generated device seed)
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:19:00
The idea is that the mnemonic is *never* input in digital form except in the case of lost/broken/stolen Trezor. What you have done is similar to taking a cold offline BIP38 wallet and entered the password+private key on an online system, to check if you wrote down the password correctly.

A few random questions :
In your recent newsletter I see your mailing address is : 54 East St, City of Panama. Why the change when you (presumably) still maintain a local office in Czech Republic ?
Any plans for a metal or ruggedised version of Trezor in the near future ?
Can you give an update on shipping numbers? Are you disappointed with these numbers considering your long crowd sale period. What does this say for the prospects of other hardware wallet developers coming to market ?
Can the session logout be added to the firmware ? I realise that one should not leave the TREZOR plugged in 24/7 but several redditor said have posted that is what they have done (and seen OLED screen burn in). 
Can you explain how multisig will work on Trezor ? Will it work seamlessly with desktop client's multisig (like armoury, electrum 2) or will it be more like the Coinkite method, or will it require myTrezor ?
Would you be able to add coinkite signing to your Python tools ? See 
Is there any particular reason the 50% false words was removed from 1.2.1 firmware ? I realise you've made 24 words the default, but I presume the mnemonic restore should be *extremely* rare for average users, so the inconvenience is worthwhile. 
What's planned for the future ? Perhaps NFC support ? Smaller/credit card form factor that can be carried in a wallet ? Touchscreen ?

The Trezor never needs to connect to the Internet, or the bitcoin network. It merely signs transactions and safeguards the private key. The private key never leaves Trezor.
Suppose Alice wants to send 1btc to Bob, the unsecured client fashions the transaction and sends it over USB to Trezor, which then displays it on screen after OTP and pin exchange. If the user approves the displayed transaction, it is signed by Trezor and the client submits the transaction to the bitcoin network. The unsecured client cannot alter the transaction to Alice sends 100btc to Hacker, because the signature will not match. Mathematics and cryptography mean trust is not required.

HW1 and ledger wallet run the same firmware. That means you can use either of them with Greenaddress or Electrum 2 beta. 
There may be some compatibility problems using HW1 with Ledger Wallet as a Ledger comes paired to a 2fa card, and I don't think there are any open source tools to make your own 2fa card. 
Electrum is a python desktop wallet, but v2 beta is unreleased so need to clone it yourself and install the dependencies. Greenaddress and Ledger Wallet are both Chrome extensions which require at least chrome v38. 
Of those options only greenaddress is multisig (2of2) but in all wallets there is a possession factor (the private seed is stored on HW1/Ledger and is not susceptible to a hacker). The smartcard authenticates the user making the transaction. 
1. Electrum  - device PIN followed by 4 digit confirmation code, via HID keyboard emulation (assuming you chose hardened mode)
2. Ledger Wallet - device PIN followed by 2fa card
3. greenaddress - device PIN plus Greenaddress 2fa (they won't sign with their 2of2 key without Authenticator TOTP, or email/SMS confirmation, you can set spending limits etc)

If your coins are in cold storage, then you do not move them or expose the private key to the internet, or to a internet connected device.
Cold storage is an offline generated wallet who's private key the internet has never seen before.
BIP38 encryption is a great idea, you would generate these cold wallets offline either on a live ubuntu CD or a never-connected netbook/raspberry/piper, and print out and save the wallets.
To then move these coins out of cold storage, you would click "download zip" here 
* Then go offline, extract the zipfile from github
* Load it up in your browser
* Make random entropy (you're not generating a new wallet, *but there's no way to skip this screen)
* Click on the Wallet Details tab
* Type in your BIP38 private key, then enter your password
After about 1 minute, you will see your decoded wallet's public and private key
You can then import this decoded private key into any wallet - like blockchain.info or multibit.
There is still one particular iPhone wallet from down under, that you can still download if you create an account from the developer's country of origin.

You're probably fine.
You don't need to "create" a wallet before you send to it.
Electrum is a HD wallet, so every previous, current and future address can be generated from those 12-24 words you backed up.
If it says "pending" on LBC it may take a while before the transaction is even sent to the mempool, let alone before it is included in a block.

Piper's electrum's QR import doesn't work, but a Pi doesn't have a webcam so no loss there. The QR dependencies were last updated a few years ago and are impossible to build for OSX. I found an OSX patch with Google, but it still is impossible to build I think.

Your electrum seed can be represented as either a 12 word mnemonic or a hexadecimal string. This is stored in default_wallet.dat
Results in the mnemonic : dear, tap, dove, flutter, person, door, sane, world, express, effort, won, blossom
To reveal both of these in the electrum console type `getseed()`
You can backup either of these in plaintext or QR code,
Or you also could choose to split them up into multiple fragments first with Shamir's secret sharing scheme.
Lastly you could choose to encrypt your default_wallet.dat,  with `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in default_wallet.dat -out secret.enc`
However if you already have an electrum password, then your hexadecimal seed is *already* AES encrypted in which case your could choose to backup default_wallet.dat
You could do all of this offline on a $35 raspberry Pi

Any computer/netbook/live boot CD/Ubuntu boot USB etc can be used to generate bitcoin wallets. 
If you do so in your home or work computer you risk leaking your private keys if you have malware/keyloggers/etc. you can also leak your keys if you use iCloud/skydrive/Dropbox/crashplan etc. 
If you generate your cold wallet on a non Internet connected device and either wipe all traces or "air gap" it from the Internet or USB drives, etc then those cold wallets should be safe if you have adequate random entropy, no weak brain wallet pass phrase, no recycled or guessable passwords etc. you can transfer coins to these public cold atorage addresses without ever entering your private key or password on an untrusted/Internet connected device. 
The reason for using vanitygen is that is what Piper's GUI and headless mode uses by default, and by using a 3 character prefix I can create new wallets in &lt;10 seconds which I know cannot be HD wallets from malicious firmware. 
My piper is air gapped, never to see the Internet or a used USB. Only new ones straight out of the wrapper. Of course USBs come loaded with software now so malware is still possible.

Terminals still have the magnetic reader in addition to the card slot at the bottom. If you try to swipe a chip enabled card, the terminal will ask you to insert the chip instead. AMEX are mag strip only. 
In addition to this we also have paywave/paypass which works as a pinless proximity reader. I think the max amount is $30 and if your card is stolen/fraudulently used with paypass the bank will cover the fraud.

The current BTC/USD exchange rate and downtrend, has nothing to do with your above observations.


You've lost faith in cryptocurrency because the price has fallen despite increased utility - ATMs, businesses online and offline accepting bitcoin, [infrastructure and services]( Deloitte]( end-user advances like multisig, payment protocol, vault, lock, insurance, BIP39/44, US based exchanges, trezor, etc
"people" may not care about bitcoin, but [Dell cares]( about it.  Sure lay people still talk about drug dealers, MtGox and "that woman who committed suicide" but the press has been increasingly positive.


Everybody now can SMS, picture SMS, Skype, FaceTime, upload a movie to social media, message via whatsapp, and upload and share photos to the cloud.
I used BBS with a 2400baud modem via telnet, these bulletin boards would phone each other once a day to sync messages/replies.  Most BBS only had 1 phone line.
 
Later we used to access the internet with dialup modems and thought [Vocaltec's Internet Phone]( and [Mirabilis' ICQ]( were mind-blowing (20 years ago!).  It took companies like yahoo/AOL/microsoft/skype/apple/google etc to bring VOIP and IM to the mainstream.  (Companies like [Sipura]( and [Asterisk]( rolled out VOIP services without people needing to know they were using it)
tl;dr : ignore the price, [bitcoin wasn't ready to hit $1200]( - thanks Willy, the [ecosystem]( is what will bring value.

Even 25% per pool is too much, to quote Satoshi


try to rephrase it in that context.


King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a certain 
number of characters in length.  Once they stimulate the network to generate a 
packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and 
erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble.  They 
only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack 
at the same time.


 It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time, and 
whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time.  The problem is 
that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different 
attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear 
the other first.


receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an 
extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its 
hash.  The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of 
them all working at once before one of them finds a solution.  Once one of the 
generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone 
changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work 
in the hash they're working on.  If anyone was working on a different attack 
time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.


proofs-of-work.  ***Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the 
proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was 
expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers 
to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time.***  They had to all have 
seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.  If the CPU 
power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, 
they can safely attack at the agreed time.


and global view problems you've asked about are solved.

Cold storage by definition is an offline generated public/private key pair that has NEVER connected to the Internet. For example if you have a offline computer/raspberry Pi with wifi disabled, no network cable etc. and generate a paper wallet in that environment. You can send to the public key fine, but to spend you need the private key to sign the transaction.
One option is to have multiple cold paper wallets and convert a cold paper wallet into a hot wallet to spend, another method is to run 2 copies of electrum/or armory, one copy on your cold offline machine and one on your hot Internet connected machine. The transaction can be fashioned on the hot Internet connected machine, and the signing done on the cold offline machine (can be an air gapped/QR code transfer), then sent back to the internet connected machine once again to broadcast the signed transaction.
If all of that sounds too much work for &lt; $1000 then just use electrum on an Internet connected machine (not cold storage) and for &gt; $1000 buy a TREZOR.  There's a 15% couon which will end soon.

Awesome. So I can maintain full control of all private keys and generate them offline and all without needing to run my own copay instance. 
Copay has been in beta for a long time. Is your multisig production ready, safe to use for any amount ? Or is it still in beta ?
Lastly you should consider partnering with btchip for brand customized HW1
I assume one could offline generate the BIP32 private keys with either [Trezor's Python scripts]( and/or import the seed/mnemonic onto [btchip HW1 via their c-api]( ?

**Toshi vs. Bitcoin Core**
Toshi is a Bitcoin implementation designed for building highly scalable web applications. It allows you to query the blockchain using a REST API or raw SQL. It comprises a number of individual services, using a shared database. Because Toshi saves much more information and indexes more data than Bitcoin Core, it requires much more space to store the blockchain (~220GB vs ~25GB as of September 2014). However, this makes it possible to run much richer queries that would otherwise not be possible with Bitcoin Core.
Bitcoin Core (the reference implementation) is designed to run on a single server, and uses a mixture of raw files and LevelDB to store the blockchain. It allows you to query the blockchain using a JSON-RPC interface.
Some examples of queries which Toshi can easily answer, which are not possible with Bitcoin Core:
List all unspent outputs for any address (Bitcoin Core only indexes unspent outputs for specific addresses added to the local "wallet").
Get the balance of any address
Get the balance of any address at a specific point in time
Find all transactions for any address
Find all transactions in a certain time period
Find all transactions over a certain amount
Find all transactions given a set of addresses

Blocks composed of transactions (and a cryptographic hash) are added by miners on average every 10 minutes.  Until a transaction is included in a block which is accepted by the network it remains unconfirmed.
If you were selling a car in person in bitcoin, it would be wise for you to wait multiple confirmations.  However if you were a vendor using BitPay (who take 0% commission) you don't need to wait for any confirmations.  (BitPay takes all the risk of accepting 0 confirmation transactions upon themselves).

[**SHILL**]( 
*A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization.*
*"Shill" typically refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers the impression that they are an enthusiastic independent customer of a seller (or marketer of ideas) for whom they are secretly working. The person or group who hires the shill is using crowd psychology to encourage other onlookers or audience members to purchase the goods or services (or accept the ideas being marketed). Shills are often employed by professional marketing campaigns. "Plant" and "stooge" more commonly refer to any person who is secretly in league with another person or organization while pretending to be neutral or actually a part of the organization he is planted in, such as a magician's audience, a political party, or an intelligence organization*

Preferably don't keep a wallet.dat containing significant coins on a USB on your online node.

Any reason for this ?  One who goes to the trouble of setting up a cold offline air gapped machine to initialize btchip and Trezor might want to dice roll some entropy. I really can't think if a downside, given no newbie is going to be building the c-api binaries anyway. Even if you don't trust the randomness of the user entropy, combining 2 sources of entropy will always trump one.

Rather, both are valued by men for their unique properties.
Gold is:
– Divisible.
– Fungible.
– Value dense. (Scarce.)
– Recognizable.
– Durable.
– Zero counter-party risk.
– Stable in supply, yet minable.
– Liquid.
– International.
– Non-manipulatable. (Non-centralized.)
By comparison:
– Diamonds, while valuable, are NOT divisible, nor are they fungible.
– Water, while valuable and divisible, is not value-dense enough to compete with gold as a form of money, on the free market.
– Food, while valuable, is not durable.
– Dollars, while liquid, do not represent zero-counter-party-risk (rather, they are debt-based.)
– Dollars, while recognizable, are not stable in supply (inflation is a worry).
– Dollars are also not minable. (Production is available only to a monopoly cartel, versus gold, which anyone can produce.)
– Food, which anyone can produce, is not liquid, especially in comparison to dollars or gold.
– Dollars, while you can hold them in your pocket, a board of bankers still has the power to reach into your pocket and manipulate its value. (This is not the case with gold.)
Soon it becomes very clear that gold was never “declared” to be a form of money by any “authorities” but rather, became money due to natural market forces.
If gold became money strictly due to natural market forces (as a result of its unique properties) then clearly the only reason it has been supplanted by dollars is due to artificial restraints imposed on the market by government force. (Such as legal tender “laws”, tax “laws”, money laundering “laws”, etc.)
Such forces must be constantly active, otherwise, natural market forces would immediately resolve back to gold again as they have for thousands of years.
Now let’s consider Bitcoin’s unique properties:
– Divisible.
– Fungible.
– Value dense.
– Recognizable.
– Durable.
– Zero counter-party risk.
– Stable in supply, yet minable.
– Liquid.
– International.
– Non-manipulatable. (Non-centralized.)
AS WELL AS:
– Non-confiscatable.
– Accounts cannot be frozen.
– Anonymity is possible.
– Electronically transferrable.
As you can see, Bitcoin’s unique properties are similar to those of gold, although it adds new properties due to its ethereal nature.
Those new properties (non-confiscatable, non-freezable, pseudonymous, transferrable electronically) all serve to route-around the artificial forces that are currently being used to supplant gold with the dollar. After all, the various immoral, legal-tender legislation in place today uses the force of a gun to impose fiat money onto an economy that would otherwise resolve to gold by natural forces. That artificial force depends on the government’s collusion with banks and their collective monopoly on the ability to issue, store, freeze, confiscate, track, and transfer dollars.

I didn't know about these. I assume one would need to write a custom transaction, probably something like moving coins to a newly generated wallet, setup a move transaction to occur after xxx time, then destroy the private key of the holding wallet. 
I guess the problem is if the move transaction is lost or rejected, those coins may be lost. 
Is there a service that offers this function ?  Maybe an n of m time-locked transaction would be a failsafe.

Private keys are needed to move bitcoin (which are stored on the blockchain ledger by the 5000+  people running a full node), and the public key (calculated from the private key) is the essentially the wallet address you send coins to.
If you generate a private key offline, this can be done on a computer that has never before and will never in the future connect to the internet, then your backup (paper or digital) of the private key or HD mnemonic is required to move they coins.
Hardware wallets are a vault, they can be USB, NFC, bluetooth etc, but they are designed to store and sign transactions with a private key they only exists on the hardware wallet, and never leaks from the hardware wallet to your PC.

Firstly that string is not memorable or easily reproducible.  If you print it on paper and have to re-enter it one day from this hard copy, and an umlaut is misprinted, you're out of luck.
Furthermore if you save it on a text file prior to printing it, copy it to memory, paste it into your web browser or OS search bar, it has already leaked onto the internet.  Especially if you use google desktop.  We already know google indexes wallet.dat files.  Not to mention ubuntu.

I'm not an expert as I am still waiting for my Trezor. There are some good informative presentations on Trezor by slush and stick on YouTube. 
Basically for secure offline storage you can either use a random generated private key or a deterministic seed. If you don't commit these to memory and keep them offline and in a secure location your funds should be safe. You can add a password to your seed in electrum for example and just store the electrum's AES encrypted seed and memorise the password. Equally you can use BIP38 to encrypt your randomly generated private key. 
Trezor doesn't really add security to the above. What Trezor does is it protects you from key loggers or malware from stealing your bitcoin (provided you initialised it on a clean machine) by storing the private keys on Trezor, never revealed to your computer, but still allowing you to sign transactions on an untrusted online computer. 
I would not carry around a Trezor with a large bitcoin balance, but it does allow for plausible deniability if you are coerced to enter your pin by an attacker.  Trezor will support longer than 12 word entropy seeds (and presumably future releases of electrum and multibitHD will also). That's why I am waiting before ordering a cryocard.

I can resuscitate the HW-1 to a fully working fw 1.0.1 on my online mac.  Desktop chrome, ledger chrome 1.2.0.
However for coinkite multisig I wanted to initialize the security card, update the firmware and load a mnemonic fully offline on my odroid.  This is not working.
The main offline missing link is the firmware update which requires the security card seed.  If I do this part on a desktop mac,  I can initialize a mnemonic on the odroid.
(Perhaps not a huge issue since coinkite/ledger cosign in doesn't use the security card,  but a bug none the less)
P.s. have you had a chance to look at the c-api issue on github? 
@_date: 2015-05-12 09:30:13
If there's interest I might write a 2nd part to [my guide](
I have successfully cloned and built the ledger wallet .crx 1.2.0 on an ARM Odroid C1 under Ubuntu 14.04, and I've already added the .crx and the 2nd factor card tool to my script.
Unfortunately [Ledger Wallet requires Chrom(ium) **38**](  This rules out Raspberry Pi A/+/B/+ (ARM6) limited to Chromium v22.  Even Pi 2 running Raspbian wheezy, is also limited to v22.
I've also tried on both Beaglebone Black and Pi 2, debian jessie, which does not have a `chromium` or `chromium-browser` package to `apt-get install`
Last night I was able to successfully flash my BBB's eMMC with `BBB-eMMC-flasher-debian-8.0-lxqt-4gb-armhf-2015-05-04-4gb.img`, download the Ubuntu armhf trusty packages and dependencies for Chromium 41 and successfully run ledger wallet.
I haven't yet tried this on Pi 2 Raspbian wheezy or jessie, and this is unnecessary on Odroid C1 where the Manufacturer's *nix distro is Ubuntu 14.04
Having said that, it is possible to use the coinkite Import Key method to co-sign with a HW-1/Nano, without using Ledger Chrome Wallet, via the [BitMEX scripts, if you are prepared to sign from the Terminal.](
@_date: 2015-05-31 22:32:59

Spending from cold paper wallets is impossible without "breaking the seal". 
You could spend and sign safely if you have a cold offline signing computer, but if you do this on an online machine you risk theft of your Bitcoin. Spending also reveals your public key to the network (i don't know if signing has the same effect) which has some quantum computer implications. (See paragraph above the [21 million BTC limit](

Would you trust that your private key would not be skimmed by an untrusted reader ? Or if the card doesn't have the private key then it needs to be stored elsewhere like a bitcoin bank. 
Lastly I have a CBA Eftpos terminal in my business (and a coinkite terminal en route). Whilst it may be possible to DIY build your own EFTPOS card reader from jayco/RadioShack, no business would do so.

I had the exact same experience with my HW-1 but I managed to fix it
Brand new HW-1 running fw 1.4.13
Using an odroid C1 running Ubuntu 14.04 (chrome 41) I cloned and built the Ledger Chrome Wallet crx. Confirmed it is working on an already updated HW-1
Running my odroid fully offline,  inserting the new HW-1,  Ledger chrome wallet,  the app asks for security card seed,  the 2nd factor confirmation, then does 100% of the firmware update, then loops all over again to the firmware update screen.
This time stuck at the "continue" for the 4 character security card confirmation.
Rebooting Ubuntu I was able to re-flash the firmware, but progress was very slow, at least 20 min to reach 100% then stuck at 100% for over 2 hours.
From here ledger is unable to communicate with HW-1,  greenaddress chrome recognized the HW-1 as not setup, but fails with invalid status 1-6985 when writing the mnemonic.
Says fw 1.01 already successfully installed
**downgraded to firmware 1.0.1 beta with**
(Gets stuck on loading bootloader step every time)
~~**success**~~ I was them able to firmware update with Ledger Chrome Wallet and setup back up to 1.0.1 ~~and then initialize my HW-1 on my offline odroid.~~
Still cannot upgrade fw 1.0.1beta with an offline Ledger chrome wallet on my offline Odroid. Same problem firmware updates to 100% then goes back to the beginning and gets stuck at 2fa check continue step
still Complains of needing the add_udev_rules.sh (even though this has already been done, and Ubuntu rebooted)

Well you could look at is as a risk-return proposition.

Do *you* believe the Altcoin:USD ratio will appreciate over time X, faster than the BTC:USD ratio, such that you will end up with more BTC or USD after time X ?
Do you believe in cryptocurrency, and would you be happier in 5 years to have the exact same number of BTC in your cold wallet that you do today, vs risk having less ?  Trading BTC for an altcoin is not hedging risk.

European merchants have processed more than 28 million euros this year in bitcoin payments compared to 1.4 million euros for the same months in 2013, which is a staggering 1900% year-over-year growth. The countries in Europe with the highest adoption rates are the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. Some of the most recognizable European companies accepting bitcoin with BitPay include AirBaltic, Destinia, Takeaway.com, Webhallen.se, Scan.co.uk, EasyHotel, 220 volt and Shipito.

Here's the metal [cold wallet template]( from [this salt water etching tutorial](
You could also apply something similar for a [coinsquare aluminium wallet]( or maybe apply salt water etching on the back of a [cryptosteel]( ?
My idea
* Run Armory offline on an [air-gapped single board computer](
* Export the [Lockbox m of n fragments]( as `.frag` text files
* Install [python-qrcode](
* Install [ImageMagick](
* Open the `.frag` files and copy the ID/f1/f2 lines
* In terminal `qr "Shift-Ctrl-v" &gt; frag(n).png`, repeat for all n fragments
* Salt water etch on side 1, a QR code representation of your fragment : `convert -frag1.png -density 96 -negate -flop neg_flop_frag1.pdf`
* Salt water etch on side 2, the text of your fragment(s) :  
* Use a text editor like Leafpad and strip out all the redundant text leaving just the essential lines.
* Pad the "white space" with [black squares]( making up a document of 63 rows and 82 characters monospaced
* open the text file in Chromium, and print to PDF frag_all_padded.pdf
* `convert -density 384 frag_all_padded.pdf -negate -flop frag_all_neg_flop.pdf`
* Save these PDFs to a USB drive, `frag_all_neg_flop.pdf` and `neg_flop_frag(n).pdf`
* Insert into a printer with USB input, [Brother HL-4570CDW]( works.
* Experiment with Direct print options (Paper size B5/Multipage 9:1, and Paper size A4/Multipage 4:1) according to the size of your metal etching plate.
* Note : you can also use `gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=output_merged.pdf frag1.pdf frag2.pdf frag3.pdf` but the Chromium print to PDF method works better.

I don't agree with this step however if it means the node cannot be used to broadcast transactions. I like that armory and electrum allow you to save the signed transaction and broadcast it however you like.  
`./configure --disable-wallet` presumably removes that ability. Having said that, the docs for BerkleyDB are quite large and an 8GB SD/eMMC with 1GB flash allocated on Ubuntu + LXDE doesn't quite have enough space.

I don't think that those not already invested in bitcoin have missed the boat.  There are only 12.3 million BTC at the moment, and perhaps a million of those are lost forever.  Cryptocurrency adoption is probably under 0.5% of the population.  
If bitcoin appreciates by 15.2% this year, it will outperform the Australian stock market's 2013 gain, and 29.7% to outperform the US stock market in 2013.
There are predictions of BTC to $2000 in a few months time.

Google authenticator is a phone based app which generates a response code based on time (my bank offers a self contained keychain with a button and LCD screen). The generated time code is individualized based on a unique key (which you need to save in case you lose your phone)
There is no desktop google authenticator app, but you can run android in a virtual machine. 
Alternatively **with a USB yubikey key you can generate the google authenticator response code to allow you into your 2fa account, without your phone**. As the yubikey does not have a battery or clock you need to run a background helper app(see link)
*In case you have not saved your 2fa "seed" but you still have your phone, you can disable the 2fa on the website (it will ask you for the 2fa code before it allows this), then re-enable 2fa and it will generate you a new seed.*

Wrong. A coinkite wallet does not expose the private seed to the user but it does supports private key sweeping (I don't believe it supports mnemonic sweeping).  Electrum 1.9, Greenaddress, breadwallet, Ledger chrome wallet and mycelium all offer a mnemonic seed but are not compatible with BIP32 and are not compatible or interchangeable with eachother. 
Electrum 2 beta, Multibit HD beta, myTrezor and possibly a future release of mycelium and armory will be BIP32/39/44 compatible with interchangeable mnemonic compatibility.

HW-1 is aimed at developers and Ledger Nano is aimed at consumers. Different packaging and polish. At the moment Ledger Nano's firmware makes it compatible with the chrome Ledger Wallet (security card) although I hear the next HW-1 firmware will add that feature. (Will still need a security card generating script/app). As it stands though HW-1 is compatible with Greenaddress and Electrum 2 beta.
HW-1's build is exactly like the plastic card you snap your mobile phone's Sim card out of. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:16:50
No. However electrum 2 is not yet released as an app/exe by the developer, you need to download and install the python-trezor tools and clone electrum yourself.  The python-trezor tools allow you to do all of the above.

Why not Ƀ instead of ฿? (self.Bitcoin)
193 points submitted 1 year ago by avsa
฿ is already used for a currency (Thai Bhat), it looks like someone just tried to make a B like dollar, is boring and stale.
Ƀ in the other hand is a unused unicode character, and horizontal dashes represent movement and speed, both things a good currency needs. Many currencies like £, € and ¥ use horizontal dashes, so it still looks like a currency. Ƀ looks like a B going forward at high speeds!

Whilst the specification has been available since the beginning, closed source firmware leaves many questions unanswered. For example there are many error return codes which are undocumented. The logic or pseudo-code of all important functions is undisclosed. Plug up devices tend to offer 3DES only, how do we know cryptographically weak cyphers aren't being used for critical secret storage.  How could black box testing ever prove there isn't a secret ledger super tracking cookie. How on earth did the recently reported HID-replay-of-seed-surviving-device-wipe bug occur, and without peer review how do we know there aren't other major bugs in the code?  Also the specification lists new features, I don't believe removed functions from the firmware have been fully documented.

However I think a better service would be to write a dummies guide to generating your own vanity addresses for a variety of OS and Architectures .

I am surprised you cold actually use myTrezor without first upgrading the firmware, but perhaps newer batches ship with 1.2.1+ firmware
* relax your bitcoin are safe, backed up on over 6000 full nodes
* they can be restored at any time with your 24 word mnemonic from any compatible client/script such as btchip / ledger wallet / electrum2's hardware wallet plugin and many BIP39/44 scripts
* email Satoshi labs support
* there was no need for you to have wipe / restored Trezor
* myTrezor will show a different account tree for no passphrase and when used with a passphrase
* given you mentioned  a 25th word I assume you used a passphrase
* if in myTrezor you Forget Device,  unplug,  close the browser window,  open a new myTrezor window,  plug in Trezor, enter your passphrase - you will see your coins
* the only possible reasons your wouldn't are myTrezor backend is offline,  your USB cable is faulty,  you entered the wrong passphrase,  or in the restore (which you did not need to do) you did it incorrectly however this is improbable as the last word is a checksum.
TL;DR : forget device, close browser,  power cycle trezor, try the passphrase again.

This is a scammer
The scammer's post from 22 days ago was




We built a dedicated hardware wallet that's easier to use than a credit card and more secure than a bank vault... a grandma-proof bitcoin wallet. We promise to deliver on both of these fronts. No compromises.












To fix “the security problem” cloud wallets began to add two-factor authentication, which greatly reduced the odds of your wallet being compromised but think about the sequence of steps required to buy a cup of coffee – unlock your phone, launch the wallet app, click Send BTC, scan a QR code, minimize the app, launch Google Authenticator, copy the 2FA code, switch back to the wallet app, paste the 2FA code, and hit send. That’s ten steps! The pursuit of security has created complexity and led to an extremely cumbersome experience relative to existing payment options like credit cards, destroying any incentive for the average user to adopt Bitcoin.
Security and ease-of-use can’t exist on a spectrum where you get one or the other, or a compromise of the two. The promise of Bitcoin is too great to settle or make a compromise and that’s why we are building Case. We like to say that we’re building the world’s first grandma-proof bitcoin wallet and while that’s a cheesy marketing line, it really does speak to the ethos of what we’re doing. A wallet doesn’t just need to be hacker-proof. It has to be user-proof. It has to be easier to use than a credit card and more secure than a bank vault or the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin will remain but a dream.

single private keys +/- BIP38 password protected is somewhat historical.  
if that's all you want to do, then you can just print a paper wallet. I wouldn't recommend you pay money for a steel/aluminium/titanium BIP38 wallet.
These days software and hardware (and web) wallets have moved to HD (hierarchical deterministic) seeds.  These can *optionally* be protected with a pass**phrase**.
You should keep your HD seed secret and non-digital, never enter it into a computer/word processor/phone/etc

Hardware wallets are based on the security principle that the private key never leaves the device.  If you don't make a backup there's no other way to do so later. ([There's a reason they give you a recovery booklet !](
Never fear, just setup your spare blank HW-1 with greenaddress and backup the BASE64 seed via HID-replay.  I suggest you use a marker pen to differentiate your 2 HW-1s so you don't mix them up.
Then move your BTC from your 1st HW1 to your 2nd HW1

Yes. If you do a bitcoin purchase through localbitcoins the seller needs to fund their LBC account to with bitcoin first, then when you initiate the trade that amount is held in escrow until either the payment window times out, or you click "paid". **You MUST click paid within that time window if you have paid, or else the bitcoin will be returned to the seller's account.**  You then wait for the seller to confirm the payment which might take minutes-hours for a cash deposit (longer for a online bank transfer).
I would advise you use the LBC escrow as a beginner to prevent being scammed.

* given you provide your own Web wallet service,  why impersonate Trezor's USB Vendor ID ? 
* if you wanted to maintain Electrum/Multibit HD compatibility you could have forked trezor-common and written your own udev rule
* why partially disable the stack protector by commenting it out ?
* if you wanted BWallet to maintain full Trezor USB clone capability (including official SL firmware) why include *only* your own signing keys
* (I can't test this out) but are the confirm/cancel buttons wired in reverse making BWallet incompatible with official SL firmware?

It is a standardized way of deriving a hierarchical deterministic tree of addresses from a randomly generated mnemonic. The advantages are that you only need to backup the mnemonic once and can recover a practically infinite number of child accounts from it in the future (your whole account history and balances), and a 12-24 word mnemonic is human friendly whereas a 160 hexadecimal seed is not.  If you are using randomly generated unlinked addresses then you need to make a new backup everytime you generate new addresses.

Just tried Greenbits 1.25 on my Note 4, works perfectly with Trezor now.  Fantasting work guys. 
Two bugs to report
* Since about 2-3 versions ago Greenaddess Chrome Extension HW1 device wipe is broken. (Android Cordova works as it should).  On Chrome attempting to create new -&gt; write to hardware wallet,  on an already initialized HW1 would show the wipe/unplug/countdown on each power cycle. The countdown does not display, nor does greenaddress enter another false pin with each power cycle. Also if the remaining count is &lt;3 Greenaddess still reports 3. 
* plugging an uninitialized HW1 into Greenbits 1.25 on Note 4 has a similar bug as 1.24 with Trezor. The PIN entry dialog appears but on clicking ok, Greenbits fades to the background (and does not progress past the PIN screen)

Greenaddress' default setup is 2of2 multisig.  You have one key, they have the second key.
You can setup certain restrictions on when they will authorize a transaction with their signature, ie: after SMS and/or email/phone/TOTP confirmation, and spending limits.
If you combine this with a hardware wallet like Trezor or BTChip, then you have something you know (the PIN), something you have (the hardware wallet) *plus* the chosen 2FA (like Google Authenticator/SMS/etc)
@_date: 2015-01-23 00:45:43
It depends on how you are buying the bitcoin. If you do a person to person trade (localbitcoins or mycelium local trader) it could be a cash transaction. 
Buying though an exchange will require you to have an account balance, so depending on with exchange you choose, if you are in the EU, etc an international funds transfer or SEPA transfer will take longer. Even making an over the counter cash deposit at a local bank branch into your exchange's bank account make take hours/days to credit to your account.

[See this video]( from about 3min 30 there is explanation of unspent outputs
A Web wallet like myTrezor does not expose the underlying complexity to the user, but a compatible client like electrum 2 beta gives you some control over which unspent outputs and which accounts you are sending from. One could also (probably) manually create a transaction and have Trezor sign it for you.

True, but Greenaddress already supports Android OTG with HW-1, and has a native Android GreenBits app which supports OTG Trezor.
The only scenario it would be useful is in an internet cafe/public computer, which had Chrome 39+ installed, user has a non-Android phone, and has setup and loaded their Greenaddress wallet with BTC and is running Trezor 1.3 firmware.

The point of BIP38 is that the scrypt protected private key does not need to be protected. You could safely post it on your Facebook and not worry about somebody sweeping your coins. The secret you need to protect is your BIP38 password, and in your writeup you create multiple BIP38 wallets, presumably all with different passwords. 
This master password list is what you need to veracrypt but if you decode it on a backdoored online computer (temporarily turning disconnecting from the internet wont help) then the thief will have access to all of your passwords.

The old saying is that unless you control the private keys, you don't own the bitcoin.  Online wallets can be hacked/subject to insider theft/fraud/etc etc.
Having said that [Coinbase Vault]( claims to be very safe, is (self) insured, and their Vault service until recently was a paid service.  
*edit : I was thinking of [Xapo vault]( ... I haven't had a good look at the claimed physical impermeability and redundancy of the Coinbase vault.  It would also appear that [Coinbase vault]( like [Coinkite Multisig]( allows you to generate your own private keys*
You will never do better that that security wise (underground bunkers, armed guards, etc) but if there is a insider theft or a flaw in their random number generator code, they could theoretically still be susceptible to theft.
If you want to control the private keys yourself, and you have a large investment to protect your options are hardware wallet (Trezor / btchip HW1 / Ledger Nano) or a cold offline generated wallet (like Armory / electrum) or a cold offline generated paper wallet (preferable BIP38 protected).  Alternatively you could look at multisig options of which Greenaddress is quite user friendly, or Coinkite multisig if you are more technically inclined, or Armory multisig.
TL;DR - Trezor or Ledger Nano, or Offline paper wallet.  But I think it would be reasonable to split your investment with a portion on Coinbase Vault.
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:15:47
To clarify, it wasn't exactly in HID replay mode, but in the mode where every 2nd powercycle it will replay the seed.
The wipe was done in the btchip mode on the alternate cycle.
off topic - trying to reproduce it now - for the last 2 greenaddress extension releases or so, the wipe HW-1 seems broken.  Previously if I tried to write an already initialized HW-1, I could wipe, and then power cycle 3 times.  Now when I power cycle after the first screen "Resetting... Please unplug and plug your device in again (2 wrong PINs remaining)" the HW1 does not register as having been powercycled in Greenaddress.
Edit : Create new wallet -&gt; use hardware wallet seed instead -&gt; Wipe -&gt; Close -&gt; Login (to exit Step 1) -&gt; Create new wallet -&gt; this does register as 1 false PIN, even though GA things you still have 3 attempts left each time.

* After a further 16 hours, transaction B was broadcast, that included the same outputs as transactions A1-A4, but different inputs. Transaction B, like transaction A4, included a fee of 0.00022. Transaction B was advertised by most Bitcoin nodes immediately thereafter, and was included in a block within half hour of being broadcast.
* Two hours after B was included in a block, transaction A1 was re-broadcast by an unknown third party. Twenty minutes later, the 0 fee, week old, not-advertised-by-anyone-ever transaction was included in a block.
So how many confirmations did transaction B receive in total ?  Was it orphaned by a longer chain, and if so which pool mined B and which pool mined A1 ?
How did you receive the 2:20 hour old valid block containing B ?  After that time if should only be orphaned if the pool mining A1 deliberately mined on its own shorter chain for 2h:20m (and/or if there were no block rewards in that time period)
\*edit -- you mean B used *entirely different inputs* than A1-A4, that would appear to be a sender error, non?

I like the concept of Chrome 39 USB HID although it excludes a portion of users, ie Pi Raspian is limited to Chromium 22 and Beaglebone Black Debian is limited to a pre-39 Chromium version also.
I never did understand why the hardwarewallet firmware update page wants me to install 2 plug up extensions into Chrome to update HW-1. 
The original Satoshilabs description was that Trezor with its scrambled PIN entry means you can safely use it on an untrusted computer like an internet Cafe. However no internet Cafe machine will permit you to install a browser plugin, a daemon or Chrome Extensions.
@_date: 2015-01-29 10:24:20
Very well said.  I agree with you.
I think it is unfortunate that Satoshi labs changed their licensing approx 17 hours ago, and back dated the license change to v1.2.1 / August 1st
I agree that it is a betrayal of preorder crowdfunders, I myself have several first edition certificates. Satoshilabs would have known that by releasing the final piece of the puzzle (the bootloader source) having already released the firmware and schematics, an avalanche of clones was inevitable.
Trezor is built on top of open source projects python/cython/libusb/firebreath/docker/gcc to name a few.

Tamar's post below quotes 94% recent uptime. I agree there were previous occasions where it was down for 24+ hrs


It does work. If you cant compile it you can still run it with `./electrum`


This is not interchangeable with myTrezor, it is a multisig alternative for experienced beta testers - not for the average joe
If you want a consumer targeted hardware wallet that might work well for you consider ledger nano - it is targeted at the "average joe", uses Chrome 38+ so no browser plugins or bridge, is a USB stick so no dodgy USB cable, works with Android OTG greenaddress, and is also BIP32/39/44 electrum 2/trezor compatible (no passphrase support though)

Trezor is a single purpose vault which generates and stores your private keys (never exposing them to your computer), and transaction signing device (generated on your PC wallet, signed by Trezor, and broadcast by your PC/wallet).  
Its security design is that your private keys **never** leave Trezor (and never leak to your PC / malware / keylogger / hackers)
That mean **never** typing your mnemonic seed into your PC and syncing to Dropbox, it need to be in physical form only (written into the recovery booklet)

The web interface wasn't slick, the 2FA and cloudflare steps made things even slower, but I don't think they were any worse than say BC.i
Their plans changed frequently over the 3 years I used them, but since they introduced multisig over 12 months ago, even a free account could store an unlimited multisig balance.
If you need more than one API key then you're not a home user. How much does an IT engineer's salary cost - more than $90/month.
The level of professionalism and transparency Coinkite showed was top notch - their uptime probably &gt; 99.99%
I think their biggest issue was legal fees - the FBI/CIA/etc have an infinite budget and can attack Google/Microsoft/Apple. Coinkite did not require a real name, address or phone number, accepted free email addresses and provided  a tor URL.
Perhaps they could have blocked US customers, but the KYC/NY BitLicense was largely what brought down BTC Guild.

ie: if you had 5000btc in coinkite multisig and they disappeared unnanounced, you wouldn't be able to move your coins unless you either manually created a multisig transaction from UTXOs, or you had pre-created an unsigned withdrawal transaction, then used their offline signing scripts.
Armory lockboxes were probably the next best multisig option, until ATI closed down.
So I would say now your best options are either a hardware wallet with passphrase support, or copay + hardware wallet.
In fact [this will probably the best option]( when released and out of beta.

It works in reverse, the blockchain is like "triple entry accounting" so in order to prove a current transaction is valid, a full node needs (one time only) to start from the genesis block and work forwards.

Full nodes only need to verify from the genesis block once. They maintain a database of UTXO unspent transaction outputs which (when signed by the private key) can validly be spent as inputs in transactions.
The more UTXO inputs a transaction contains (ie faucet or pooled mining income) the larger the transaction in bytes.

I don't understand why hardware wallet vendors dumb down their security.
SatoshiLabs : fw 1.2 all recoveries have 50% fake words, removed for default length seeds about 18 months ago
Keepkey : no support for passphrase in their Chrome ext wallet.
Ledger : in unified firmware with Chrome ext wallet :  removed duress/erase PIN, removed &gt;4 digit PIN length, browser as single entropy source (doesn't use the hardware random number generator), initialisation MUST be on a secure clean PC. (Old method used HID replay of hexadecimal seed == the reason [cryptosteel included hexadecimal characters]( as a stretch goal)

2. Setup HW-1 in greenaddress (Create new wallet -&gt; use hardware wallet seed instead)
3. Replay seed on external device (android phone in my case)

5. Login 3 times with incorrect PIN

Cancoin transactions can only be sent with the combination of two private keys, creating the highest level of de-centralized security for your bitcoin. One is a private key that is held in Cancoin's highly secure, level 3 datacenters, on Ledger Hardware Secured Modules (HSM). The other is supplied by the user in the form of a 24 word mnemonic (or locally encrypted passcode). When the user creates and signs a transaction, the information (hash) is then sent to Cancoin's HSMs to have the second private key applied, resulting in a successful transaction that can be confirmed in the blockchain. 
Are you using HW-1s or Ledger HSM (I thought this was not released yet).
Is it one HW-1 per customer ?
If you're using HW-1 it requires human intervention on your side, a Cancoins employee would need to physically insert it into the USB port, then power cycle to HID replay the binary seed in plain hexadecimal (old method) or use a python/c script/Chromium app to generate and then load it on to HW-1
Both methods expose the secret to Cancoins employees
Is your only multisig 2 of 2 like the default green address configuration ?
What happens of your data centre burns down, do you keep a backup of each customer's HW-1 generated secret ?
You mentioned you support Trezor, how does that work ? Does that work ? Does that method complete avoid the above step of generationg the 2nd key in browser ?
Do you support a configuration of 2 of 3 multisig or where the client controls ALL cosigning private keys ?
How does your service compare to Green Address ?

No, pooled miners complete a proof of work and add blocks to the blockchain (which contain transactions, except when they're "empty").  Full nodes maintain a full copy of the blockchain, verify blocks and maintain a mempool of transactions.

It is designed to be transacted with like physical cash bills. You can pass it from person to person to person and transact off chain.  Because you preload the BTC in advance, you can purchase with it by handing it over and the recipient can plug in an intact opendime and confirm the public key balance, and that the private key has not revealed (irreversible).  No blockchain record of the transaction (Person A to Person B or on to C/D/E)
Like cash if you lose or destroy it, the balance is gone. There is no backup.
All the code needed is on open dime, so you just plug it in and it has the html code built in.

Also mining is anonymous, if you connect your s7's to a pool like eligius there is/(was) no registration, only your public key.

Perhaps the time has come for either Ledger, or to release a flash dumping tool to allow consumers to confirm they are not being [Evil Maid attacked]( by a fake device. This would apply both to the a fake Trezor or a fake Ledger device.
clarified that that the MITBitcoinExpo presentation demonstrated a [Trezor with malicious bootloader and firmware, whereby a user's attempt to update the firmware would be spoofed, leaving the malicious preseeded firmware intact.](
Releasing an unsigned flash dumping tool for Trezor would allow consumers to confirm the bootloader is legitimate, and matches the SHA256 Hash of the deterministically built source code.
Being unsigned, it cannot be used by an attacker to extract the stored seed or PIN.
Such tools have been used [for years]( already by [stellaw]( and [btchip]( but it would be beneficial for consumers to have the same tool.

In my humble opinion, this is **\ NEWS**
Ledger claims this unpatchable vulnerability in Trezor devices is due to their use of a general purpose STM microcontroller, which are standard (easy to obtain by an adversary) and are not hardened to resist glitching, side channel attacks nor designed to resist attack by hackers with physical access and infinite time/resources.  The only cure being to revise the hardware and use a smartcard for storing secrets.
As if smartcards are a magic bullet, they have been in credit cards/phone cards/PayTV satellite boxes for 30+ years and no they are not uncrackable. Bootleg satellite TV dishes and decoders have been available for decades. HDMI / DVD / Bluray / UHD encryption has been cracked.
Around the time Trezor was a kickstarter project sales pitch, and prior to its release (selling for 1-3 BTC each !) There were many talks, interviews and presentations.
In my post, above, I link to a presentation by from over 6 years ago where the Q&amp;A discusses hardware vulnerabilites (since deleted from youtube).  One audience question was regarding attack via JTAG pins. Stick replies that any secrets stored on the flash can ultimately be dumped by an attacker with enough time and money. He says something like "there are companies in China that you can send them your STM chip, and for a few thousand dollars, they can delid the chip and dump the flash ROM with a electron microscope within a few months. The Trezor is not invulnerable, but it is there to buy you time, and depending on how much the attacker thinks you are holding on your Trezor the cost of the attack might outweigh the reward. If you notice that your Trezor is missing, you have weeks to move your funds, before the attacker can dump the flash and steal your funds."
in my linked bitcointalk thread also says the exact same thing, a hardware wallet is not invulnerable, but far far more secure than anything else. (And from back then Slush and Stick were reinforcing that a passphrase means the costly flash dump attack is futile)
What about smart cards ?
Before Ledger was started, (Ledger's CTO) sold the HW.1 which closely resembled a credit card/phone SIM card.  This is what wrote about smart card security in 2014










Now Ledger's current hardware uses a pub/priv key pair signing, a serial number registered with their HSM, attestation and other features that were not there with the HW.1 but security is not a binary situation.
Nobody ever claimed that a STM microcontroller is unhackable. Nor did Ledger's CTO claim a smartcard is immune to a determined hardware reverse engineering lab like Chipworks (see their work on Apple A4-A9 chips)

The [Trezor One malicious bootloader vulnerability]( is not new, but is one of the 3 methods mentioned in the article (Supply chain/counterfeit).
The Ledger presentation talks about an "unpatchable" flaw in Trezor One and T, which presumably is responsible for the seed encryption being added to the latest firmware.  Stick answered, perhaps 5 years ago, in a Q&amp;A that the STM micro flash is dumpable by companies in China, and the goal was to buy the Trezor owner time. If you notice your Trezor is missing, you have weeks, in which time you use the recovery words and move your crypto.

* If the bootloader is not malicious, the flash_dump_tool firmware would be loaded in the application code sectors from `0x08010000`.
Its job would be to dump the entire 512kB flash from `0x08000000 - 0x0807FFFF` including the bootloader and firmware.
* If an evil maid bootloader spoofs the firmware flash, the command line flash dump will fail == evil bootloader.  
* If the evil maid loaded a functionally identical bootloader with a backdoor (extra pubkeys, etc), the dumped bootloader will not match the genuine bootloader.
* If the evil maid bootloader spoofs the firmware flash, and spoofs the flash dump, this could be mitigated by building the flash_dump_tool from source and modifying 1 byte of the source code to change the hash (assuming the flash dump tool is released as source code and not just as an unsigned binary)

I agree this is just as relevant to a ledger or coldcard (assuming the bootloader can be replaced). I would love to be able to deterministically build Ledger's firmware and bootloader too.
Rodolfo does give the example of a trojan hardware wallet with a radio transmitter designed to capture the user's PIN (coldcard does not support passphrase), in which scenario the attacker is sitting nextdoor with the real hardware wallet entering the PIN whilst the user enters their PIN on the trojan device.
In Coldcard's case they mitigate the risk (from what I gather) with a Check Genuine LED, a clear case, and by splitting the PIN in half and where 2 secret words, known only to the owner, are displayed once the first half of the PIN is entered correctly.

I can't say I agree with their conclusion about Ledger X and Keepkey scoring 9/10 for durability and Coldcard 6/10, Trezor T 7/10
Whilst the reviewer might be smitten for elegant metal and plastic enclosures, they're fingerprint and scratch magnets. The keepkey would look terrible after a day in your pocket with keys. There are numerous reports of the Nano X metal cover scraping against the plastic screen.
Coldcard scored 6/10 because it is transparent ? Their plastic is far sturdier and harder than Trezor One and Ledger Nano S, about as rigid as a car key remote.  On the other hand there have been a few cases of the microSD being inserted between the case and slot.

LBC is like eBay, the cheap "buy it now" offers are snapped up leaving only the more expensive listings.
If you buy from a LBC listing, there are no fees for you (only the advertiser pays 1%), make sure you use the site escrow and only but from sellers with perfect feedback, 100+ trades

With Trezor you don't especially need an airgap machine, however you can do everything you need to do on a $15 ARM board + $5 microSD card.
The key with Trezor is that your private mnemonic is generated on Trezor and is never exposed to your day to day PC.
Write down the mnemonic with a pen and paper, don't store it on your PC/cloud.

Yes.  The device is made out of steel, which means the individual letters were stamped into each steel letter piece.  Some letters are harder to read than others. `i`, `r` and `j` for example are a little difficult to read.

Assuming you are using a phone wallet like mycelium or breadwallet, the sender pays the mining fee, so you'll receive the amount requested (you can send a QR code with the payment amount and address, or a link)

See the risk guide here
Even a bank transfer or in person bank cash deposit can be reversed by the buyer after the fact!
If the bank transfer does not include the transaction localbitcoins ID as proof, then this will make it harder for you to contest a chargeback if the buyer attempts to scam you
Always use escrow, and do not release the bitcoins unless you have payment confirmation (a buyer may attempt to scam you by spoof emailing your payment proof, or sending you a forged SMS photo showing payment)
For a LBC transaction of $50,000 from a stranger, there is risk. I would suggest you first make a much smaller trade, $5,000 and see if they attempt to scam you.
[This is the sort of verification]( you *should* do to protect yourself.
You should insist on a [Selfie ID photo **and** Trade screen ID photo](
If the trade sounds suspect, they buyer is trying to force you or rush you in to releasing the escrow ASAP, don't be fooled.

The 12, 18 or 24 word *mnemonic* is generated on your Ledger Nano S, and from this all of your private and public keys are derived. 
The *passphrase* is like an additional word appended to your mnemonic, and can either be entered as a temporary passphrase, or linked to a separate PIN.

* Does seed generation use 2 sources of entropy ?
* Is the mnemonic seed generated on the hardware wallet and exclusively displayed on the OLED screen ? Or on the chrome wallet extension like HW.1 ?
* How does mnemonic seed recovery work ?
* Out of the box does Ledger S work with mycelium/electrum or will they need updates ?
* Will a new udev rule be required for *nix ?
* What happens after 3 incorrect PIN attempts ? Will Ledger S share the power cycle requirement between PIN attempts ?
* What are the specs of the STM chip ?
* Where are the apps stored ? On the STM ?
* What source code of Ledger S is available to review ? 
* What's closed source/NDA and unavailable ?
* When's shipping?

Move your funds.
One option is to create a new wallet on a clean device (phone/desktop) and send all your trezor btc to it. Then reset Trezor with a new mnemonic seed, write it down, then send your funds back.
It is possible to do it bypassing the phone/PC wallet step if you
 reset Trezor
write down new mnemonic
copy the new public address
restore old trezor mnemonic
send all btc to new public address
restore new mnemonic

I wrote my Single Board Computer script several years ago, as a means to initialize a cheap Pi / Odroid / Beaglebone as the cold offline airgapped computer. A Pi is probably the best as it is readily available and has the Pi Camera accessory.
In the circumstances of Cold Offline storage, these reserves are not something you would typically be spending from often.  Similarly if you had a 3 of 5 Multisig arrangement.
Therefore you can prepare in advance a spend transaction (unsigned on your Hot watch-only computer). Provided you have not subsequently used those same coins/inputs in another transaction, the unsigned spend transaction can be used by your Cold Airgapped PC years later.
Having said that, [I agree with Andreas, the biggest risk is having such a complicated setup that you accidently lose your private keys.](
A hardware wallet + passphrase is the best if you have enough crypto to lose sleep over.

Hardware wallets like keepkey and Trezor store the mnemonic [in plain text on the microcontroller]( protected only by open source firmware.
With physical access to a device and unlimited time an attacker can extract secrets from any device (PC, microcontroller, secure element)
So if you had a second keepkey you could either keep it blank (the mnemonic recovery is scrambled to the host PC); or load the same mnemonic and keep it under lock and key; or as hardware wallets gain additional features you might choose to have an every day carry around with you keepkey as your "hot wallet", identity token (u2f) and password manager, and use your first keepkey as a "cold wallet" under lock and key.
Alternatively if there were a good multisig method like coinkite used to offer, or perhaps copay integration each keepkey could have a separate mnemonic.
TLDR : with keepkey and trezor - use a passphrase and consider a durable mnemonic backup like cryptosteel.

If you run your own node, assuming nobody has tampered with it, and the peers it is connected to are truthful then you can avoid such attacks. 
If you for example use a light wallet that connects to random strangers' nodes you don't know they're not logging your IP address and linking it to your accounts, nor that they're supplying your light wallet with false information.

Satoshi Labs is not a US company.
They likely log the microprocessor's serial number, but [this is ONLY queried when in bootloader mode, it is not queried by the firmware in Trezor wallet mode](
see also 
stickac [explains the reason for displaying the microcontroller serial number]( in bootloader mode is to allow users to check they have a genuine Trezor and not a imitation.
If you order form them online you need an email address and shipping address, there is nothing stopping you using throwaway999 and a PO Box for the shipping address.
You don't need to ever link your Trezor to SatoshiLab's online wallet - you can use it with mycelium, multibit HD, electrum or your own bitcore node (but would first need to connect to the mytrezor wallet, then disconnect from the internet, then connect to your bitcore node if you did not trust them).

Hardware wallets like Trezor/Keepkeyhave a factory installed non-modifiable bootloader which checks firmware signatures.
Both use multisig signing of official firmware releases, and you can inspect the firmware (and bootloader) source code and deterministically build the firmware yourself from the github repository.

BIP38 paperwallets are not durable, you need to make sure they're stored in a air tight bag, in a dark dry environment.
They're more secure than keeping your private keys on your online PC or phone, but BIP38 is hard to backup.  Human's can't reliably transcribe a BIP38 string without making errors.
There are some [interesting electrolysis backup methods from 2013]( there was even a [DIY home kit](
A 24 word offline generated mnemonic is what I would recommend, in the case of Trezor - that mnemonic is generated on Trezor mixing 2 sources of entropy (PC and Trezor's MCU) and is never exposed to your computer.
In the the case of Ledger Nano S - the mnemonic is generated on the Ledger (single source of entropy) but can be generated completely offline (no PC required, only a USB battery pack \*or AC charger !)

If the broadcast node wont relay the transaction, use a different node, or run your own.  With mycelium wallet (android) some nodes wont relay a transaction with the lowest fee setting, I think smartbit does relay low fee transactions.

Are there any additional fees to the visa card ?
Given the fee structure I assume it is the same wavecrest card that other services like uquid are using.
Converting the free 1000 mBTC to USD or AUD gives the same 0.7% fee below the bitpay rate. From there the value is presumably kept in the chosen fiat currency like coinapult locks.
The visa card is debited I assume from this USD balance ($2/month) as are the Visa debit transactions.
Are there any additional fees for using the Visa ? These smaller companies charge a "loading" fee, whereas I don't think Xapo does.
Can we cancel the visa card to stop these $2/mo deductions.
Can we order multiple Visa cards ?
What happens if our USD fiat balance is zero, but we have wallet balances in other currencies/BTC ? Will the monthly fee be deducted from our non-USD balance ?
Do you plan to offer other currency Visa cards ?
What documentation is required for verification ?
How do customers withdraw fiat currency ? For example if Alice sends Bob USD$100 via Mobi to his phone number, how will Bob withdraw the USD (if he has no interest in converting to BTC)

One striking thing about this bull run is the low trading volume compared to other cycles.
Looking at the `2y` or `all` scale, this bull run is being driven by reduced USD exchange supply, either because of large OTC volume off exchange, or miners/whales choosing to withold supply.

There was alot of panic amongst home miners in 2013-2014, because difficulty was ramping up, ASIC shipments were generally preorders with long delays, and most often paid for in bitcoin (with the BTC price going up between time of ordering and time of arrival).
That meant every week not mining (ASIC not delivered) would eat in to your calculation of whether you would ever ROI in bitcoin, mine back what you paid in bitcoin.
Therefore when your pool goes weeks, a month with improbable bad luck, the panic result was to switch pool. This is one of the reasons almost all of the original pools are now gone and gigahash hit 51%.

Because some of us have been here through the spike from &lt; $100 to &gt; $1100.
Of course increasing 12-fold in 6 weeks was a bubble that unsurprisingly popped, but following the initial crash, the price rose back to around $800 and hovered there through to around Late Jan/Early Feb 2014.

The Bcash fork retained the same SHA-256 proof of work algorithm as bitcoin, so the same ASICs can mine either coin.  A Bcash is block reward is worth 2.8% of a Bitcoin block reward (plus the transaction fees per block on Bitcoin are worth an additional 1-2% of the block reward) miners allocate 97-98% of their ASICs to mining Bitcoin.
As the Bcash price continues to plummet, so will its hashrate and difficulty.

Google translated :
BTC nighttime trend showed a warmer trend. The lowest level went to 11300 and started to go up. The highest went to the hourly chart. The 60-day moving average was at $11,570. If the current level of 11500 is stable, the trend will continue to return to the upward mode. Although it has slightly increased after the opening, However, energy cannot be continuously supplied. At this stage, although it has come above 11500, the K-line has shown a trend of continued shocks, and the long-term indicator will re-shock;
On the daily chart, the cross K of the cross star was received yesterday, which means that the downward trend of the trend will change. The bottom of the bulls below is strong. The MACD of the chart remains above the 0 axis. The short amount can continue to weaken. RSI keeps the 60 horizontal line up (V: CY-52520). Today's BTC trend has formed a turbulent upward trend. However, after successfully returning to 11500, most of the long and short indicators are mutually offset, so today's short-term operation strategy suggests shocks. ;
Operation suggestion: 1150-11550 near the batch more than one, stop loss 11300, target to see 11700-11800, break the 11800 to see 12000 above;
The empty list is recommended to enter the market without breaking or breaking 11800. The target is to look at 11,500, and the target is near 11300-11100.

The moment you listen to the Stephan Livera podcast featuring M. Flaxman ��
Jokes aside, a hardware wallet is vastly more secure than a desktop/laptop/phone hot wallet.
You are the biggest security liability, you're the weak linkn either forgetting your PIN, or skipping the mnemonic backup step, or getting a PM / spam that your hardware wallet has been damaged and you need to immediately go to  and enter in your mnemonic words, or install some airdrop claiming trojan malware that steals all your bitcoins.
The best advice is follow the [Five golden rules]( 
Never ever make a digital copy / photo / lasspass of your mnemonic. Only use a hardware wallet where you can enter the passphrase on the device (Trezor T, Coldcard, Nano S/X).
Edit : Trezor / Ledger / Electrum will **never** send you a private message by reddit or telegram. So if you post that you're having a issue with using your device with Electrum and you recieve a DM from offering to help, that person is a scammer !

It Coinkite wallet was running in 2013, and by 2015 (or earlier) had multisig support and Ledger hardware wallet support.
Given that the fully hosted coinkite wallet had significant annual fees (and the lower tiers a per transaction % fee) within a very short time the vast majority of users moved their funds to Coinkite multisig (which had 0 fees and the option to control all of the signing keys yourself, without needing to rely on Coinkite's HSM signature).
So if you ignored their warning that the service was going to shut down, including the Coinkite HSM, then you're out of luck.
Edit : Coinkite did say in their welcome email


But nobody with their eyes on the ball would not have moved to Multisig a year before they closed.
All Coinkite transactions were on chain, and they give you your xpub in the signup email, so you can see if your lost coins have moved.

Whilst there are alternative bitcoin full node clients, what you're trying to say is "how do I connect my electrum wallet to my own Bitcoin full node?"
Answer : 
* 1) Run Bitcoin Core + Electrs (electrum rust server) 
* 2) or Run Bitcoin Core + EPS (electrum personal server)
* 3) or Run Bitcoin Core (with txindex=1) + ElectrumX
Then use Electrum wallet with the "one-server" option and connect it exclusively to your own Electrs/EPS/ElectrumX.

Bitcoin Armory as a company attempted to sell software licenses and developed IP tied to a corporate entity that went bust.  That also meant the domain is owned by the same corporate.
The open source project was voluntarily continued by a former employee/contractor GoatPig, but as perhaps 1 year of bitcoinarmory development was owned by the corporate entity, he had to re code these developments from scratch, working in his free time, without pay.
Those who were using the open source bitcoin armory wallet would not have lost funds as the users generate their own keys.  In fact Armory was best of its class at the time, supporting cold/hot airgap, lockbox multisig, and privacy and verification of connecting to your own full node.  It just never recieved hardware wallet or BIP 32/39 support.

The billfodl is a copy, cryptosteel made the original design and open sourced the schematic.
Cryptosteel is hand made in Europe on old fashioned machinery, whilst Billfodl is mass produced in China.
Cryptosteel has stamped letter tiles, which means they have a slight stamp curve to them (like a metal washer) so they have friction inserting them in to the slots. This might also prevent them sliding out easily.
Billfodl letters are laser marked, they're definately much easier to read, but you would have to look at Lopp's torture tests to see which one is more durable.
The crytosteel is much stiffer, the pivot hinge is tighter, the closing knob clasp is much tighter, and the letter door to open is much harder to open.  
The billfodl opens very easily. This could mean if you drop it the letters will fall out.
The billfodl is substantially cheaper, if you open in incognito you can get some free stickers, if you leave it in your shopping cart I think you'll get a discount email. Once you've completed your order you'll get a limited time discount coupon for your next purchase.
Cryptosteel is very slow to ship, and slow to reply to emails. Billfodl shipping and customer support is fast.

Monthly fee services have been tried in the past.
My favourite was Coinkite + [hardware wallet multisig]( + [offline signing scripts](
* What are your service's fees ?
* Is it mandatory to use your company's hardware device, and is it open source ? Has it been security audited ?
* Is your service at all co-signing such as bitgo or greenaddress ?
* What happens if your service disappears tomorrow, how will users recover their funds ? Coinkite had a fantastic web interface where cosigners could login and sign the multisig transaction. However an unsigned recovery multisig transaction could be downloaded locally for use with the offline scripts in the event that Coinkite was not available.

An attacker cannot change a signed transaction (and with segwit, malleability has been fixed)
If your computer has malware, an attacker could install a clipboard trojan such that you go to pay and invoice and the malware changes your clipboard copied address to something else.
Most modern bitcoin wallets are HD where public and private keys are derived from a 12-24 word mnemonic seed. If your attacker has that mnemonic, or your xpriv / ypriv then they can use that to sign a new transaction to steal your bitcoins.

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
I am Dr. Bakare Tunde, the cousin of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Abacha Tunde. He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 6 space station in 1979. He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-16Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989. He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved. His other Soviet crew members returned to earth on the Soyuz T-16Z, but his place was taken up by return cargo. There have been occasional Progrez supply flights to keep him going since that time. He is in good humour, but wants to come home.
In the 14-years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost $ 15,000,000 American Dollars. This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association. If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth. I am told this will cost $ 3,000,000 American Dollars. In order to access the his trust fund we need your assistance.
Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account or subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.
Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20 per cent of the transferred sum, while 10 per cent shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between the parties in the course of the transaction. You will be mandated to remit the balance 70 per cent to other accounts in due course.

Why use only a 12 word mnemonic, was that security decision based exclusively on what could fit on the display?
Trezor displays the 2 entropy sources used to generate the mnemonic both confirming device and computer entropy and allowing a user to independently verify the process, does keep key do the same?
Firmware update mode needs to be impossible to accidentally boot into, Trezor has 2 buttons required to enable this mode, how does one firmware update keep key?
A dedicated Cancel button is user friendly, the whole point if having a screen in the first place is for verification and as an anti MITM countermeasure. No point in an extra large screen with no easy cancel method. (Pulling. Out the cable or waiting for a timeout is not used friendly)

Using hexadecimal is not a good idea, as there will be a significant manual transcription human error risk.
You can use BIP39 words as your passphrase. The advantage being it is easy to generate these passphrases, and they all have unique first 4 letters.

I did see a karma score of 0 for the post.
Anyhow I will enquire with GA exactly what the benefits are when using their 2of2 service. Presumably if their server is down Greenbits still won't work, and the cosigned transaction is likely broadcast by them (so no privacy benefit over mycelium) and GA likely run a full node, so no SPV vulnerabilities.
They do recommend using tor for privacy in SPV mode.

Given that Ledger is based in France with strict Euro/cash restrictions in place, needing to convert BTC payments to Euro, etc.  It worries me that Ledger Live is becoming more centralized, needing to connect to the HSM for firmware updates, etc. I remember you previously wrote Ledger Nano can be initialized offline via USB battery, but with these critical firmware updates, a network connection is required to your HSM.
Are Ledger Live users going to be subject to the same KYC questionnaire as [Bitstamp]( users ? One could always use electrum / electrum personal server, but critical firmware updates will still require Ledger Live + Interpol KYC ?

The xpub let's you generate all past, present and future hierarchical deterministic addresses. You don't need to "do" anything to receive, most HD wallets will generate a new (the next sequential) address as soon as you recieve. 
So yes. Your online Armory does not contain the private keys, it can generate new receiving addresses and new (unsigned) spend transactions.
Be aware there are only no more than 6,000 people in the world running a full node, whereas sites like blockchain / circle / coinbase claim to have millions of users each.

Most users are not going to use python intialization scripts, so unless the browser wallet supports it as an option, almost 100% of users will use 12 words.  Your recovery card only has 12 lines. 
How does your firmware display 18 or 24 words ? Does one press the button to scroll to page 2 ?


I did not see the entropy being displayed on the youtube video, but i may have missed it.  Is it displayed with a browser standard initialization ?

When keepkey launched (a Trezor fork) they listed the large screen recovery as a major feature, being so easy it is feasable to wipe your KK between uses, and restore to spend.
Trezor's advanced recovery for Trezor one is even easier IMHO, it is via mouse click matrix like the PIN.
So for those HODLers worried about a thief having physical access to your Trezor/Keepkey, stashed in your sock drawer, then wipe it and keep your mnemonic seed safe (and set a passphrase, recorded separately from the mnemonic)
If you intend to HODL for years, letter punch stamped metal wallets should last several lifetimes.

A "unique pieces of artwork that represent Bitcoin" does not need to come with holographic stickers, or a user might be confused and store 1btc on the "Commemorative Edition Metal Wallet" and find the sticker glue/paper/ink has degraded and unrecoverable in 5-10 years.
Perhaps a disclaimer to keep a separate backup.... how much do you think 1 btc will be worth in 5 years ?

You can only pick 2 !
* Secure + Stable + Cheap/Free == bitaddress paper wallet generated on a clean offline machine (inconvenient to spend)
* Secure + Slow + difficult == Bitcoin Armory (needs both online and offline machines, need to run a full node on your online machine, transfer unsigned transaction from hot to cold machine to sign, then back to hot machine to broadcast
* Alternate = Hardware wallet : Trezor = fast + secure, requires 3rd partly service/privacy leaks your xpub, Ledger = needs an offline machine to generate your wallet.

* F2Pool = 20%

Coinjar list a "coinjar best rate" and then their buy/sell rate is about 1% above and below that.
They charge an additional 1% I think for conversion and 1% for loading.
ie : BTC -&gt; AUD = 1% fee
BTC -&gt; swipe = 1% fee (I think)

Ultimately ether will be worth something. There are many useless coins with no utility, namecoin has no utility. Ether is gas for ethereum, the problem being it is infinite, with a massive developer endowment (these same developers who've already dumped their BTC crowd fund balance) and at present there is no utility for this limitless gas.
Should ETH take over the world such that the demand for gas exceeds the supply then its price should go up. The present buyers are gambling that there is will be a bigger fool to sell to for a profit.

I assume CASA came with a pre-loaded blockchain, and it just caught up to the latest block.
CASA, nodl, bitseed and Bitbox Base are all interesting.  I am waiting to see Bitbox Base because it has 4GB RAM, PCIE NVME storage and an integrated hardware wallet.
Wasabi coinjoin doesn't yet work with hardware wallets, but a full node with an integrated hardware wallet could make the next leap.
I get the impression that CASA is an annual subscription $300/y that will probably include hardware upgrades every 1-2 years as part of the price.

I thought they did, maybe they've changed it or my recollection was wrong.  I haven't initialized via myTrezor for quite a while.

If you wanted to store your crypto (and not spend it) for years, you can generate the mnemonic seed on the hardware wallet (Trezor/Ledger/Coldcard), record it by stamping into metal, and then wipe the hardware wallet.

The mnemonic seed represents a random number, that is used to deterministically gemerate pub/private keys. Such that the mnemonic is the only thing you need to backup.
If you worry about a thief stealing all of your funds, you can pbysically secure your seed (in a safe, or with cable ties, hologram stickers or a padlock), or encode it with a cipher, or ColdCard archives it in a password protected .7zip file on MicroSD.

12 / 18 / 24 word mnemonics are valid under BIP39, in fact the [BIP doesn't specify mnemonic length]( it only needs to be a multiple of 3.
Copay *currently* uses BIP45 so currently it will not work with any other software wallets/hardware wallets.  [This might change]( in the future.
Copay being fully open source allows you to run your own local [copay server]( so you're not dependent on Bitpay's servers.
There are many options, try them all out and see what suits your needs the best.  Small "cash" amounts in your phone wallet for spending, cold storage/multisig/hardware wallet for your savings.

So the Odroid N2 / Pine64 4Gb / Pi 4b 4GB will work.  The sync will go much faster if you connect to an SSD rather than spinning HDD.
There are actually ISOs you can burn on to a microSD to get you started such as Raspiblitz or Ronin

Armory is a hierarchical deterministic wallet.
You generate your wallet (xpub and xpriv) offline.
Then export to a public / hot / online machine your xpub which allows you to see all balances, and to fashion transactions.
You then transfer the unsigned transaction to your offline / cold machine which holds the private keys.
You then transfer the signed transaction either back to your online Armory, or to any free service which let's broadcast a transaction

Some wallets allow you to choose which UTXOs you want to include in a transaction.
Say you have UTXOs like
    0.6
    0.4
    0.1
    0.0001
    0.0001
    0.0001
    0.0001
    0.0001
If you want to send 0.5 BTC, the minimum number of UTXOs would be `0.4 + 0.1` but if you send 0.1005 then your wallet most likey will use 6 inputs.  The more inputs, the larger size your transaction will be.
Electrum does allow you to choose which UTXOs and even to use a 0 fee, but it might choke on a heavily spammed public address.

At the moment you can keep it there. If there is a hard fork things will get interesting, because electrum tends to connect to random servers.  You won't know with 100% certainty whether the server is running Core or another incompatible client.

There are a number of things about the Ledger HW1 / Nano.  It is cheap and secure - I like that it wipes the secret seed after 3 incorrect PIN attempts - I really like multisig.
However it is designed work with Ledger Chrome Wallet - this requires Chrome 38+, which rules out all Raspberry Pi Debian installations (raspbian wheezy + raspbian jesse).  It almost rules out Beaglebone Black (I have managed to download and install the Ubuntu Chromium package under BBB).
The Ledger Chrome Wallet App, last time I tried, had a firmware update bug with (almost) bricked my HW-1 when running offline.  [I don't know if that has been fixed yet](
And yes you need a clean, malware, trojan free PC/Mac to initialize your Ledger hardware wallet on, PLUS every firmware update currently requires you to wipe your Ledger first (3 incorrect PINs), update, then restore your mnemonic (again requiring a clean, malware free computer).
Lastly - as Ledger wallet is intended to be used with the Chrome Wallet, all entropy is provided by Chrome.  Not combined with hardware entropy (as Trezor does), nor user supplied entropy (such as bitaddress.org).
Apparently Ledger will eventually provide a clean boot ISO for people to use, and future firmware updates will remove the need to wipe then restore the mnemonic.
Trezor's security model is that the mnemonic *never* exists in digital form, that you never type it into your computer (except in disaster recovery).  Trezor also recommends for advanced users to implement a passphrase, which Ledger does not support.

Bitcoin QT and bitaddress for example produce random unlinked private keys.
Hierarchical Deterministic wallets take a secret seed and produce a near infinite tree of private keys from this secret.  This secret can be expressed as a long hexadecimal or base64 string, or as a mnemonic. Restoring a HD wallet from your backup mnemonic restores all of your HD private keys (up to the look ahead number, if you created 21 sequential HD private keys and make a deposit into the 21st pubkey, the restore will by only look up to 20 unused pubkeys - the default address gap limit)
If you import a random non-HD private key into armory/electrum/etc then the mnemonic restore has no chance of knowing those non HD keys.

The biggest theft attack vector is where somebody types in their recovery seed in to their PC.
Every few weeks on somebody posts how their funds were stolen, and as it turns out they googled trezor wallet, clicked on a malicious adword fake site, that said "your trezor is damaged, please type in your recovery seed to this page"
With about the same frequency I see posts on that they upgraded the firmware on their Ledger Nano and had to restore their mnemonic seed.
Reading these absolutely makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.
This is horrible from Ledger, even if unintended.  The recovery seed should be like the nuclear football, you never, ever use it, unless it is the end of days apocalypse mutually-assured-destruction scenario.
I would recommend Coldcard Mk3 and running your own full node (+ electrs) and Electrum connecting exclusively to your own node.  
I can't say I've used Coldcard with Wasabi (connected to random public nodes) but there are many youtube videos on the topic.

Buy a hardware wallet and make a paper backup. Trezor for example works with mycelium for android.

Words can be repeated, so there would be (edit : ��‍♂️) 2048\^24 combinations (ignoring checksums) and using passphrases has been recommended for the past few years.  Furthermore a mnemonic mining ASIC would need to query the blockchain to see if a particular wallet contains a balance, in each of the various derivation paths m/44/etc
A more fruitul ASIC I thibk wpuld be one that searches for flawed random number generators providing the entropy.

A few thoughts. 
I like what I see, your demonstration videos make the workflow appear fast.
Your Chrome extension wallet reminds me of kryptokit, will it have the advanced features like account labels, message signing, choosing inputs, generating successive HD receiving addresses, choice of fee ? Or will there be a separate Chrome app allowing that ?
Using a wallet API like chain or Blockcypher will probably result in much higher uptime than running your own BoP backend, service uptime and privacy were the main reason for people pushing for electrum integration.
Electrum only solves privacy and trust if you run your own electrum server + full node. Any plans for supporting SPV connection to your own trusted  full node like Schildbach wallet and to a lesser extent multibitHD ?  
I feel Satoshilabs do not share the same security focus as Ledger. Trezor's recovery method dumped 50% fake words for 24 word seeds over a year ago and they offer infinite PIN attempts. Your seed recovery method looks much safer and as you advertise, enables safe recovery on demand so the device can be wiped in between uses.
Do you also support the same obfuscated method for entering the passphrase, and if not why not ?
Why even allow a thief to have 17 PIN attempts or infinitely more. With safe device recovery there should at least be an option to wipe keepkey after 3-5 incorrect guesses like Ledger.
What is your strategy for those who cannot run Chrom(ium) 38 (ie all RaspberryPi Arm6 boards, and those Pi2 users who stick to Raspian repos.) I think Android mycelium would be a good alternative, but will you support Firefox/safari ?
Can keepkey run Trezor firmware ? Any reason not to include their pubkeys ? Even if there is a warning "this firmware is not official keepkey firmware, but has been signed by Satoshilabs public keys"
Congratulations on your product, and good luck.

You can't back them up without sending a pin through the hole (revealing the private key) so if you keep the OD intact and you lose it (or it breaks) your coins are lost.
But the concept is great, and they are a way to do anonymous off chain bitcoin trades with no paper or digital record.

Do you know if electrum, copay, armory, ledger or trezor will still exist in 5 years time ? 
Armory and Electrum have been around at least 7+ years and supported split cold offline signing with a warm unsigned spend transaction made on a separate hot computer. They both have their own implementation of backups, multisig and unsigned transactions.
Moving multisig to bitcoin core, and if bitcoin core + most software and hardware wallets support PBST unsigned transactions you could potentially use *any* software + hardware wallet combination to sign your Multisig transaction.
The wallet software would not even need to know what brand of hardware wallet you choose.

I've only watched the first third....
BIP 174 is a Partially Signed Transaction, that is potentially software and hardware wallet agnostic, supporting multisig.
We've had for years many great multisig solutions, Armory Lockboxes, Coinkite Multisig +/- Ledger +/- offline signing scripts, Greenbits 2 of 2 multisig, Electrum Multisig +/- hardware wallet.
Then additionally Bitcoin core, multibit, web wallets, MyTrezor, Ledger Chrome, Ledger Live, Blockchain.info + Ledger, and Mobile wallets : Mycelium, Schildbach wallet, Ledger / Live, etc.
PBST unifies these so the wallet software, the multisig setup and +/- brand of hardware wallet don't matter.
It also might simplify fully airgapped cold signing such as via QR code or microSD

The problem with persistent storage is the device leaks the secret seed.
* Initialised Ledger fw 1.01 seed on the secure element
* wipe device, upgrade to fw 2.0, reboot on airgapped ISO, restore 24 word mnemonic
* with persistent storage, under normal operating parameters the secret seed is copied from the secure element into the separate partition. 
* users are no longer protected by the secure element, PIN brute forcing, nor can they guarantee the persistent storage doesn't still contain the secret when reselling (like a photocopier harddrive). Even if you add persistent storage wipe to the PIN wipe, this is not secure element power glitching protected.

With Schnor and MuSig in the future there will be probably be more wallets supporting multisig based on bitcoin core.
There is risk I think in making complex multisig arrangements with Copay / Armory / Electrum, in that 5+ years from now it may be very difficult to sign a spend transaction.
For example [Ledger used to sell a nano / HW.1 multisig pack]( that worked with Coinkite (up to 15/15 multisig), Copay and Electrum.
In just a few years since, coinkite has shut down their custodial wallet, Google has deprecated chrome extensions and Ledger Live doesn't support HW.1, Nano (Nano without the screen) or Blue. 
Armory and Multibit's original developers have also long since left.

The biggest mining pools with the majority hashrate might not include zero fee transactions.
There might only be a small fraction of miners that still use priority.
The only reason for me to use zero-fee spends is if my wallet has a nice number like 1.00000000 btc and I am moving the whole amount.

That would be a fantastic question to ask a panel containing the majority of mining pool operators :-)
One Scenario is that each pool operator themselves own the majority of mining hardware on their pool, and that external miners represent a small fraction.  This could be estimated looking at block reward payments, and what % of the 25btc goes where.
Another scenario is that most of each pool's hashrate is from anonymous external miners, the only way to estimate the maximal possible hashrate of an anonymous individual would be to subtract the publicly announced farms from the network total. (ie: are the announced farms &gt; 51%)

So priority goes up with each day, and the number of coins; and down with the transaction size (number of UTXO inputs)
    priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytes
I don't have a magic age for you, but if your coins haven't moved for 12 months, then their priority will be x365

Electrum practically forces you to make a backup of your seed.  It displays the mnemonic and asks you to retype it back for confirmation.  If one chooses to skip that step, then you have no backup.
There are services who offer to brute force forgotten passwords for you, Electrum doesn't use any key stretching and only a single round of AES, so should be very easy to Brute force if your friend remembers the letters.

My dream security setup years ago was Trezor + Copay/local myTrezor + Bitcore.

The above guides are for people wanting to run a full service client on a Linux system, with multiple services like lightning, tor, electrumX, a block explorer, and an LCD display showing stats/exchange rates, etc. (Usually on a single board computer like a Raspberry Pi)
You don't need to do any of that to just run a Bitcoin node, you can just download the client for OSX 
If you decide later that you want to install wasabi wallet / electrs rust server / lightning, you can worry about that later.
Alternatively if you want to remain with OSX, but install a few more services from the start, try this

This is false IMHO.
5 years ago Miners reserved block space specifically for zero-fee transactions.
Most large miners announced their [policy to remove this zero-fee reserved space]( several years ago.
None-the-less, I can still spend old coins with zero-fees.  The *only* reason for a miner to include my zero-fee transaction in their block is priority. I would however recommend you enable RBF !

As recently as a week ago the mempool was close to empty
Lets say you have old coins, in cold storage, split up in multiple small separate wallets like 5.00000000 BTC, and you wish to move then split your airdrop coins.
It is desirable and possible to move these coins with Zero fee as some pools still mine 0 fee transactions. You just need to watch the mempool when it is a few Mb, use electrum/EPS with RBF, broadcast and wait 12-48 hours to be mined.
If your transaction is never mined after 2 weeks or gets rebroadcast to the mempool by a third party, you can bump the fee.
Edit : Old coins = higher [priority](

Running a node is self sovereignty and 100% control of your money.  Bitcoin is decentralized.
Of course you could keep all your coins on Coinbase, use a SPV phone wallet, or desktop Electrum wallet. However your funds can by KYC confiscated, or your light wallet sybil attacked or you connect to a malicious electrum server.
This has nothing to do with transaction fees, which are paid to miners to bid for space in a block.
Bitcoin blocks could be 2Mb, 4Mb or 128Mb, but that is still kicking the can down the road.  The blockchain is growing the rate of about 50-60Gb per year.
On the other hand the [Ethereum blockchain (Archival node)]( is 2,544.07 GB after less than 4 years, and there are probably fewer than 10 archival nodes running.

* Coldcard does not support a [passphrase]( which is an advanced but extremely powerful layer of protection.
* Trezor uses 2 sources of entropy for seed generation, whereas Ledger and Coldcard use only the device to provide entropy.
* Ledger nano supports passphrases, but trying to enter it with those tiny little buttons is a nightmare
* Ledger can generate the mnemonic seed fully offline with a battery pack or USB charger.
* Trezor one advanced restore, Trezor T and KeepKey have a larger display allowing you to wipe your hardware wallet between uses, and restore the mneumonic to spend (this is not recommended or a standard use case, but the option is there)
* Coldcard and Ledger use closed source library code for their secure element. In the case of Coldcard they also use [closed source code for SHA256](
* Coldcard's MicroSD card introduces other potential [vulnerabilities](
* Coldcard have not answered the question, [does their STM microcontroller have the same unprotected bootloader rewrite bug that Trezor One does.](
* Coldcard's bootloader stores 5 public keys, key 0 is the "public" signing key allowing 3rd party developers to reflash custom firmware to enable the green light, prior to shipping to their customers (the example is altcoin developers). However **if** the bootloader can be replaced any/all of the 5 public keys can be changed, enabling a software evil maid/intercept attack to defeat the green light.  
* I haven't checked the Coldcard firmware, but at least in the case of Trezor/Keepkey this would be caught as [the firmware calculates the Bootloader's hash 'get_features']( So if a customer purchases one of these and immediately flashes official firmware they can detect a modified bootloader.

If your random number generator is flawed then your crypto is not safe. Mixing 2 sources of entropy is one simple solution, which is how Trezor generates its mnemonic seed. Another way is for user entered entropy (wiggle the mouse and type random keys) or to try to add physical entropy - motherboard temp sensors, etc.
As far as I can tell the the hardware wallets using secure elements only use one source of entropy.

If you want to backup your mnemonic seed digitally you would be safest using a clean OS. One might consider tails and an old laptop.
Years I looked at setting up a Raspberry Pi / ODroid single board computer and Pi Camera (for scanning QR) codes to allow airgapped offline signing with Armory/Electrum (ie you generate generate your mnemonic on the cold airgapped Pi, export the xpub to your hot computer, create unsigned spend transactions with your xpub on your hot computer, convert to unsigned spend transaction to QR, scan it on your cold airgapped Pi that hold the xpriv, sign the transaction, convert to QR, scan it on the hot computer (or mobile phone) and broadcast.
This script also contains shamir secret sharing, and Trezor / Ledger scripts, but I have not updated it in years.
You could also use AES encryption on the Pi `openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc`

You mention that they did reply, and said they were escalating your ticket to their tech support department.

All exchanges including Coinbase, Shapeshift and Coinjar have many posts here about slow customer support.
However I agree with you that BTCmarkets' 0.85% fee is outrageous so I usually deposit on both IR and BTCmarkets if buying.
Coinjar usually has a better sell price than either of the above, and that sell price includes the `-1%` from their midpoint rate

People were so naive then.
You would mine in a pool, and see every week your earnings would drop off, little by little.  Pools had a top 20, so you could see who was  in that pool and how much hash rate they had.
It was like an addiction, you were fighting to stay in the top 10, and fighting to keep up your place on the list and fighting to keep your payout the same.
New equipment was being announced, pre-ordered were taken and shipping was delayed by many many months. Every batch of ASICs shipped by YiFu the difficulty jumped. Panic. The longer the delays suddenly you were going to barely break even, then it was a matter of minimizing your losses.
If you received a 1st batch of most miners - BFL/bitfury/KNC/hashfast/YiFu/friedcat you could either make a profit or break even.
Pretty much everybody else who preordered lost out, big time.

Run a bitcoin 0.15 node, I believe these will block btc1 nodes by default, and withdraw any coins stored on a exchange/coinbase/bitpay before the Nov fork.
Bitcoin will survive, and if it means I have to dust off my 400GH/s mining rigs for a few months to support the network, so be it.
At least we can see with bcash/bitcoin that miners follow profitability, so whilst Antpool might move their hashrate to S2X it would be most rational for other miners to continue on the bitcoin blockchain to maximize profit.

Seed recovery is a doomsday end of world apocalypse event.  Entering it to check compromised the entire security design of Trezor in most cases. Offline air gapped testing is possible, but most users will not do that.
Before sending funds to your hardware wallet it is recommended that you first did a initialization/wipe/restore to make sure that you're comfortable with the recovery process.
If you've already loaded BTC on your Trezor, and your backup is inaccurate you risk losing your coins if you wipe. (Having said that all hardware wallets warn that you must have a backup prior to doing a firmware upgrade just in case)

- segwit transactions are now 9-10% of all transactions.

With a cold offline airgapped system, you have 2 computers.
One internet connected, with the xpub/public keys.
The other airgapped offline, and used to generate the mnemonic seed/xpriv/private keys.
You can transfer the xpub from offline -&gt; online via QR code for example the [Pi camera](
To spend, generate a spend transaction on the internet connected PC, transfer the unsigned transaction to the airgapped machine via QR, sign it, and send the signed transaction back to the online PC (or your mobile phone) via QR code to broadcast.
Edit : to recover, you just type in the mnemonic seed in to your cold airgapped machine.

Yes. If a group of miners controlling more than half of the hashrate agreed, they could force users and bitcoin services to adopt a modified protocol, by jamming the blockhain that uses the old protocol. The new protocol could do anything, from setting mandatory minimum fees to reversing past transactions and seizing coins. Or increasing the number of coins. Whether they would want to do any those things is debatable, and depends on their PR and marketing ability.
**Barry Silbert** calls advocating lifting the 21 million cap "thoughtful".

I assumed to generate the Wallet word list you needed to enter the mnemonic seed into an online calculator/web browser/etc.
If your method is to manually calculate a score by subtracting the index number for each mnemonic word by hand (without a computer) that might keep the mnemonic hacker/malware safe, but I suspect the transcription error rate for a 24 word mnemonic will be extremely high.
Also I would not trust a website to remain up for 2 years, let alone 20 years.
Many services like coinkite, btcguild, coinsquare, etc etc etc have shut down over the years.

You could split the bitcoin into multiple wallets, via several transactions, broadcast separately and mined in different blocks.  (of course the blockchain is a public ledger so this alone will not prevent the [IRS or Chainalysis]( from tracking back to your original 50btc address).  This would not split your bcash.
If you use shapeshift there's a limited maximum conversion size (15.12 bcash at the moment) so you would need to make multiple transactions, and could use a different bitcoin receiving addresses for each transaction.
You will have the same dilemma with future forks - bitgold, B2X, etc ...

B2X is a much better name than segshit.
Irrespective of whether you use a hardware wallet or not, it would be wise to let the dust settles immediately *after* the B2X fork.
If your Trezor arrives at least 12 hours [*before* the B2X fork]( you might consider sending your bitcoin to myTrezor with an appropriately high fee to not get caught in the mempool.
The only advantage here is that myTrezor will likely offer a coin splitting tool to redeem your B2X fork coins.

You have to convert BTC, which is done at their "sell" rate. 
Coinjar lists a floating rate with their Buy/Sell price +1/-1% above or below this rate.
I suspect they adjust this floating rate to maximize profits, so if they have more buyers, the Buy rate is above that of local exchanges, but that also means their Sell rate is higher than btcmarkets/etc.

Pre-fork you will get all hard fork coins if you control the private key (like you do with Trezor).  It remains to be announced if/when SatoshiLabs release a coin splitting tool, like with bcash.
If you keep your pre-fork coins on an exchange/online wallet you don't control the private keys and may never receive the B2X
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:11:27

@_date: 2017-10-17 22:27:41
It works perfectly.
Coinjar list 3 rates.
The **Coinjar Midpoint Rate**, and a **Buy** and a **Sell** rate, 1% either side of the midpoint rate.
When you load your eftpos card, you get the Sell rate = 1% below the midpoint rate.
Now the +/- 1% is coinjar's margin, and I see the midpoint rate fluctuating up and down by $200-400 over the course of one day.
I imagine depending if there are more coinjar buyers or sellers at the time, raising or lowering the rate according to exchange demand increases their profit margin.
So when the BTC/USD jumps +$100, the coinjar midpoint rate jumps up by more (assuming more coinjar buyers then sellers), dragging up the Sell (EFTPOS recharge) exchange rate with it.
Remember btcmarkets takes a 0.85% fee, whereas the coinjar sell price already has their 1% fee deducted.

Generally SPV wallets connect to multiple nodes, 6 or more.
If you want to make sure your breadwallet is connected to the bitcoin network, and not a B2X cluster you will either need to look for somebody to post a list *post* B2X fork, or to run your own full node, or to use a non-SPV wallet.

The Coinjar midpoint rate fluctuates a few hundred dollars over the day.
Because their spread is 1% either side of that rate, depending if there are more buyers or sellers at the time, raising or lowering the rate according to exchange demand would presumably increase profit.
Btcmarkets is 0.85% and Independentreserve 0.5% I would advise putting money on 2-3 of them and see which is cheapest at the time. Note BTCM and IR have bots which will bid against you, as I'm sure all other exchanges have bots too.

Electrum and Armory support that exact setup.

2) transfer your xpub to a online machine
3) create an unsigned spend transaction on the online machine
4) transfer it (via airgap preferably, QR code) or USB/CDRom to your offline machine
5) sign the spend transaction
6) either transfer (preferably via airgap) to your online wallet Electrum/Armory to broadcast, or use a public blockexplorer or your own full node to broadcast/sendrawtransaction.
Honestly though, this is what people were doing 4-8 years ago. These days, buy a hardware wallet.

Trezor and Ledger firmware have added U2F such that you can use your hardware wallet as an authentication device, like a yubikey.
However if you have your crypto on your hardware wallet, you probably don't want to walk around with in on your keychain, and Keepkey has no hole to pass a string.

For your cryptointerest deposits, those coins are more like p2p lending risk, or sold for fiat and loaned out, fractional reserve.  They then buy back on market the bitcoin to pay interest, and if they are denominated in fiat whist your fractional reserve balance is in crypto, they will not be able to buy back your bitcoin in the market 10x in 1 month.

That should work. However there is not a great need for cold offline signing with a trezor. You could just as safely use it on an online PC, the real advantage of a cold air gapped offline signing machine is where you *don't* have a trezor and wish to use electrum or armory.

Post fork, without replay protection, transactions will be valid on both chains.
So if Alice sells Bob 100 Segwit2X coins for $100, then Bob can replay the same transaction on the bitcoin network and receive 100 bitcoins.
myTrezor had a nice security design for Bcash (which does have replay protection anyway) where redeeming one's Bcash involved moving them to another address before they could be spent.
So :
Alice's BTC+Bcash shared address -&gt; Bcash (only) to another HD address of Alice's on the Bcash blockchain -&gt; Bob

Your coins will be fine where they are.
The Segwit2X blockchain fork won't occur till November.
If you have a substantial holding, rather than downloading electroncash and risking fake/malware, myTrezor had great support for redeeming Bcash and will hopefully do the same for Segwit2X coins.
Edit : your coins would need to be on Trezor *before* the Segwit2X fork, so for example you can't now redeem your Bcash this way.

"Light" wallets do not require you to run your own full node.  SPV wallets connect to random full nodes using bloom filters. Electrum connects to public ElectrumX servers.
Scammers have stolen over 870 Bitcoin from electrum users already, by DDOS legitimate ElectrumX servers and running large numbers of malicious scam servers. These evil servers pop up an error message when you try to broadcast a transaction from electrum, directing you to download a malware fake electrum client that will steal your funds.  They could also pop up a message saying "your wallet is damaged, please type in your mnemonic seed to restore your wallet" and steal your bitcoins

Bitaddress is trusted by the community. The standard BIP38 only supports single randomly generated addresses. A desktop client like armory adds hierarchical deterministic addresses (easier/safer backup, xpub), lockboxes (multisig) and offline signing. You will however need to maintain a full node to use armory.

As for the electrum+trezor offline signing, I would have thought if you exported your xpub to an online electrum, created an unsigned transaction and transfered it to your cold offline machine, trezor should be able to sign it.

The issue is needing to spread the R&amp;D over the number of units sold. I imagine their production run would have been in the low hundreds vs 5,000-10,000 for Trezor.
KeepKey has better fit and finish than an Xbox 360 or Dual Shock controller, the RTM versions will apparently be even tighter than the developer review units with a metal button. I would say the [build standard]( is between that of an [Apple magic mouse]( and [B&amp;W MM1 speakers.](
I don't necessarily agree with their price point, but they're not *just* a cheap imitation.  FWIW my Trezor with free shipping came in a "deck of cards" standard box with a self disintegrating USB cable, and took about 6 weeks. Keepkey arrived with FedEx tracking in under a week, in [this box](

The [BIP32 spec]( is designed such that your private seed can be used as an [authentication device/token]( such as [Trezor Connect]( or with [BitID](
This would still require some backend encryption of the stream, IP cameras do not support this and no standard RTSP-over-HTTP software supports this, so you would probably need to save the streams to an encrypted container/vault.  Trezor does have some proof of concept [encfs]( command line encryption, but it is not multisig.

Would it be possible to initialise a HW-1 with the python/c tools, making it compatible with ledger chrome wallet, *and* the coinkite multisig `Hardware Wallet` option (instead of the coinkite multisig `Import Key` option)
Can the command line tools generate/pair a security card to HW-1 ?
If I use the python/c tools to initialize HW-1 and set a PIN &gt; 4 digits, can I maintain compatibility with ledger chrome wallet *and* coinkite mutisig `Hardware Wallet` ?

I fell for this phishing method too. A few years ago I was looking at bitfury's 100TH cloud mine.  There was a (probably fake) post on BCT linking to a payout list (or something). Clicking the google docs link brought up a login/password page, to which I entered my credentials, only for the page to say after that - you're not authorised to view this document.  Changed my password and added 2fa.

Yes armory lockbox can do this, just be aware that you need to run a full node on your online armory (hence a 30+ GB blockchain plus armory database).
You export your xpub key from the cold offline armory to your public armory,  create unsigned transactions on the online armory, send the transaction file for signing to the offline machine, then back to online armory for broadcast. 
Alternatively you could offline sign Coinkite multisig, or just use Trezor (only multisig if you use Greenaddress for now)

Keepkey is a Trezor fork/clone and has a superb recovery method, that is so good you could safely wipe the hardware wallet between uses and seed restore to spend.
Ledger doesn't use a general purpose microprocessor, rather a smartcard to store the secret seed which is designed to be more secure than a general purpose microcontroller, with the downside being the parts of the firmware and compilers are closed source/proprietary.

You're mistaken, i was not offended. Moderating is both a passive and active activity.  This post was reported, which means it landed in the mod queue inbox - seen by all mods.
In this case the report was declined and the OP stayed, depending on who saw it and when, we generally would not remove a OP with many replies.

A few questions :
I assume it has 3 states - factory uninitialized : can copy a photo as entropy / Read only (private keys have been generated on device) / lock broken : private keys revealed ?
So in the factory uninitialized state one could presumably copy across data (like an AES protected .7zip file ?
Does it combine user provided entropy with hardware generated entropy ? IE is there a hardware random number generator in the device and is it used to generate the pub/priv keys?

I had an email chat with Gary Rowe back in 2014 prior to the public release of Multibut HD. I asked him why electrum had an intelligent fee guesstimator and Multibit/HD does not :








priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytes
and stops you sending a 0-fee transaction if it will not be accepted by miners












*Yeah, not going to happen I'm afraid. We get this a lot where people want to squeeze fees to the lowest possible amount and then cry foul when the miners reject them leaving them in limbo. Since the transaction is valid it just sits there on the network and can't be recalled. If the change output is high, say, 10 BTC then the user can't spend that until the transaction is mined and that won't happen because of the tight fee. So the user loses cash flow for potentially weeks until the transaction is taken out of the memory pool.*
*The reason we can't just make better guesses at a fee is due to the limitations of SPV mode. We can't calculate the age of the coins because we don't have the full transaction history. As the network fees drop we respond by releasing a new version. At present the fees to guarantee fast inclusion in a block are about 10,000 satoshis and these are likely to drop to 1,000 satoshis sometime before Christmas. At that level (about 0.4 US cents) very few people will think they are being hard done by. Even 4c isn't an awful lot when spending $10, especially if the merchant is offering a $1 discount for using Bitcoin in the first place.*

I believe ATI Technologies, the original founders of Armory still own that domain, and parts of the codebase.

The safest backup is one that can be easily / reproducibly done offline leaving no digital footprint. 
Trezor does this by displaying the mnemonic on the device display and providing a booklet for you to write down the mnemonic. (First 3 words of each word are unique so some protection against bad handwriting)
Alternatively if you have a cold offline computer (or are prepared to buy a $35 raspberry pi) you can setup a cold offline Linux machine to create your Electrum/Armory/MultibitHD mnemonic on.
A ledger is good but you still need a trusted machine to initialize on, and with every firmware update you will need to wipe/update/restore your mnemonic.

Armory has pros and cons - you need a synced blockchain to spend.  So if you don't sync for 3 months and decided you want to buy something from steam, you will have to re-sync bitcoin-qt.
Armory Technologies Inc has also shut down, having made their source code modifications from the last 18-24 months no-longer open source.
[Another developer has forked the code]( and is single handedly working, for free, to re-create the last 18-24 months of code. (without copy/pasting ATI's commits)
How long can/will a single unpaid dev keep Armory going ?
If you're thinking of buying a substantial amount, I would suggest you buy a hardware wallet (preferably one with a built in screen).
Trezor has the nice option of *almost* Armory level of privacy, where you [connect to your own local bitcoind copy of the blockchain.](

        &lt;p&gt;Using an encryption passphrase adds an additional level of security.
          You'll be asked for your passphrase every time you want to access your
          wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="alert alert-warning alert-withicon"&gt;
          &lt;span class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign alert-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;h4&gt;Passphrase encryption is for experts only. Proceed with caution!&lt;/h4&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Passphrase works like a 25th word of the seed which is not stored in
          the Trezor. If you forget your passphrase, your wallet is lost for good. There is
          absolutely no way to recover your funds.&lt;br&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;If you mistype your passphrase, a different wallet is created, which
          will look as if you had 0 BTC on your account.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;If you choose to use passphrase encryption now, you cannot turn it
          off later and vice versa (if you choose not to use it, you cannot turn it
          on later).&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div class="checkbox"&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;
              &lt;input type="checkbox" name="passphrase-protection"
                     ng-model="settings.passphrase_protection"&gt;
              I understand all the information above and I want to enable passphrase encryption.
            &lt;/label&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

The ST microcontroller is probably closed source proprietary, so there could be undocumented secret flash, but it is unlikely SatoshiLabs or KeepKey have access to such secrets if they exist.
It is possible to dump the entire flash, and ensure there is no "blank" sector with hidden code.
Without taking an iFixit magnifying glass to the PCB one couldn't know the board hasn't a 2nd microcontroller....
The bootloader checks the signature of the firmware and the firmware in turn calculates the SHA256 hash of the bootloader. Dumping the entire flash you can prove the write protected bootloader and the firmware match the deterministic build.

With Bitcoin you're buying digital gold and a permanent eternal timecoded place on the bitcoin blockchain.
With ETH you are buying fuel for a programmable turing complete language. You're basically buying convertible stock in a dev team. The ETH blockchain can be and and has been reversed, they have regular hard forks and as far as I can see their foundation recommends end users run pruned nodes, they're likely going to switch to proof of stake.
The problem with investing in a dev team is one of politics and buy outs. We've seen Microsoft "hire" for gardening leave the lead developer of Borland's Delphi which was in competition with Visual Basic, and Google hire the lead developers of Java.
With ETH you're investing in a start-up that can chop and change or pivot at any time. 
Many of bitcoin's limitations - smart contracts, massive scaling are best left off the enduring proof-of-work secured and validated bitcoin blockchain, and shifted to things like side chains, rootstock, lightning network, payment channels, etc.

    "seed_version": 11,

mycelium gear likely uses `m/44'/0'/0'/0`
so if you then switch on  to **Derivation Path = Custom** and **Custom Path

(repeat with m/44'/0'/0'/0, m/44'/0'/0'/1, m/44'/0'/0'/2, m/44'/0'/0'/3... as required)

IMHO [This is the best video]( if you have 20 minutes to spare.
I don't recommend anybody use an old fashioned "random" public/private key pair. Older wallets/apps (bitcoin core, multibit, bitaddress, vanitygen) take 
random entropy and generate as many wallets (pub/priv key pairs) as required. The problem with this is backups are hard -- unreliable to hand transcribe and the the number of keypairs grows every time you transact because wallets discourage address reuse, so old backups may not have all the change addresses. (Bitcoin core pre-generates another 50 or so change key pairs, but if you send many transactions your old backup won't contain newly generated change addresses).  These can optionally be protected with a pass**word** (+/- BIP 38 protection)
For this reason some early wallets like Electrum and Armory went with Hierarchical Deterministic key generation.  Random entropy is used to create a single random "seed" which is then converted to a strong of words (12-24) called the mnemonic seed.
Later the seed -&gt; mnemonic process was standardized, as were the mnemonic to HD address tree derivation and optional pass**phrase**. [BIP 32]( BIP 39, BIP 44
These have the advantage that it is reliable for humans to backup 12-24 words (the dictionary of possible words is chosen such that only the first 4 letters are required) and all present and future (change or otherwise) addresses can be recovered with this one backup. For example a payment processor can generate a new receiving address (pub/priv key pair) for each transaction.
The wallets that support the BIP 32/39/44 standard include mycelium, MultibitHD, Trezor , Ledger, KeepKey.
Some wallets use a different incompatible  derivation like Armory/electrum/breadwallet.


The private key is needed to sign transactions. A bitcoin transaction from Alice to Bob contains Unspent Transaction Inputs (UTXOs) - this information is freely available to any wallet from blockchain data. A valid transaction signature is required to send bitcoin.


The blockchain contains all bitcoin transactions. There are no totals, so in order for a full node to determine how much Alice's balance is, it adds up all UTXOs (and back validates their transaction history)


Bitcoin core let's you password protect your wallet. Multibit let's you password protect individual wallets. Electrum let's you password protect your electrum mnemonic. BIP 38 let's you encrypt a single private key.
Modern BIP 32/39/44 wallets generally support a [pass**phrase**]( which modifies the mnemonic seed, giving an entirely different HD tree.


HD wallets have an xpub from which all public keys can be derived (there is a matching xpriv). This allows a payment processor for example to store their xpub of their webserver, without risk of a hacker stealing their funds (because only the hardware wallet knows the private key/s)

For maximal security you need **cold** and **offline**.
To achieve that with armory, you need 2 computers.
One machine 100% offline that never connects to a networked machine/internet/WiFi etc. You generate your Armory private keys on this computer, and they're immune to hackers because this computer is offline.
Your second PC runs armory and Bitcoin-Qt , and has your xpub but no private keys. You generate unsigned transactions on this machine (need to know the UTXO inputs, henece needs to be online) then send the unsigned transaction to your offline computer (via CD-Rom, camera/QR, sound/microphone), then send the signed transaction back to your "online" computer to broadcast.
If that sounds complicated buy a hardware wallet. HW-1 is 15 Euros, a keepkey/trezor is $99.
\*Edit : [my script]( is a little outdated, but is a setup script for readying a Raspberry Pi/Odroid/beaglebone to act as your cold offline machine. It hasn't been updated to goatpig's armory fork.

Bitcore remains at bitcoin 0.11.x and doesn't include libsecp256k1
On the other hand bitcoin core doesn't seem to enable txindex by default, so my data directory requires a full reindex (which I estimate is going to take 7-10 days).
It would appear I cannot speed this up by using core 0.12 with txindex=1 to reindex as it is [not backward compatible]( with 0.11.x in bitcore.
I assume there would be the same txindex=1 reindex requirement for copay

The majority, but not all were to There were 16 posts removed and only 5 manually approved (we see a green tick for manual approvals). These manual approvals could have been in response to a post being reported, in which case it sits in the mod inbox like an uncompleted task.
There are many low quality submissions here, some are short summaries of existing articles which are of no merit, and some are unique articles of existing content which add nothing to previously linked articles. 
btcfeed does behave in a very spammy way, but the content of the articles I've skimmed does appear to be original.

No,  You can create a spend transaction of known UTXOs, and give it to Bob and Carol, but not a blank cheque to sign anything.




You could create a dead man's switch or an nTimeLock transaction.  Coinkite does allow your to leave in event of death instructions, so you could specify that Bob and Carol are your heirs / etc in event of death.
You could create a gmail dead man's switch email with the password for an AES encrypted copy of your priv key for Address A that you've previously given Bob/Carol






You could give them both a Ledger nano/HW-1 but not reveal the PIN.  The PIN could be in your will or a dead man's switch email.  Ledger will self-wipe after 3 incorrect PIN attempts.

Only the 12-24 word mnemonic +/- passphrase needs to remain secret.
It can be transported hundreds of miles away, your imagination is the limit.
It can be restored/recovered via software or onto another hardware wallet - the cheapest one is only €15
Plausible deniability by passphrase, or even multiple mnemonics.
Keepkey for example has such a good recovery method that it is feasible to wipe the device in between uses and recover as needed to spend.

Functionally they're much the same. Same security philosophy and mostly same open source software. 
Keepkey's main differences are that the [bootloader can be deterministically built and verified](
And from a security point of view the seed recovery on keepkey is superior (scrambled like the Trezor PIN entry).  Passphrases are not supported by KeepKey Chrome wallet, but are supported with electrum + keepkey plugin.
With both Trezor and Keepkey the passphrase entry is **not** scrambled, but I have pointed out to them that it **should** be an option (same method as seed recovery)

If you have a few hundreds then a Ledger hardware wallet is strongly  recommended (cheap and safe)
If you plan to invest more for cold storage, then a hardware wallet with a screen that does not require a clean PC to initialize is worth the investment. Just remember that recovery mnemonic stays off line - *never* type it into a computer/phone/browser.
You might consider something like [cryptosteel]( honourable mention to multisig with a hardware wallet as a cosigner.

python-trezor is written by satoshilabs, electrum's trezor plugin by m0mchil.
Electrum 2 beta has supported Trezor since July 2014.  The *official* 2.0 release binaries (probably) do not have trezor or btchip support yet, so in the meantime you will either need to wait, or to `git clone` and install the dependencies yourself.
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:10:38
Glad you fixes it. Electrum connects to servers run by volunteers, and seems to choose different servers from time to time between restarts presumably for privacy. If you connect to a server that's not working for you (red circle) you just need to quit/restart, or open wallet file again, or manually choose a different server (by clicking on the red circle) until it works.

A Raspberry Pi B/B+ is quite slow - decoding a BIP38 address might take up to an hour.  Bitaddress works, you will find Chromium 22 gives you a warning that the script is taking a long time to complete, just walk away and come back later.  I haven't tried Iceweasel (firefox) for BIP38 on Pi, it might be faster.
Also generating anything longer than a 3 character vanity address (1xx) will take a long time.

HD wallets generate addresses sequentially, and when looking up balances, the number of addresses read ahead is called the [gap limit](

I would advise either a Pi B+ or Pi 2 B which have 512MB and 1GB or ram respectively and are both about $40. The advantage of more ram is significant. 512MB is I would say the minimum acceptable.  
Armory runs in 3 modes - online, offline and testnet. 
 In order to spend from Armory you need to be running a Bitcoin Core node + Armory online.
The cold offline setup involves running offline Armory on your Pi and generating your wallet there (xpub/private keys), and then exporting the xpub key to a separate computer running a full node + armory in online mode.
As this online machine only has the public keys, it can be your every day computer.  This online armory is used to create new transactions (it needs to be online to know who you're paying and which inputs to use).  You then transfer this unsigned transaction to your Pi via USB stick or other clever method, sign it in offline armory, then transfer it back via USB stick to your online Armory computer for broadcast.
If you do buy the Pi you might find [this script]( helpful. You need 512MB RAM to build cython.

Very much a "war on cash" to force people to deposit wages into a bank account, and to force transactions to be via bank services.
Once physical cash is wiped out this forces people into holding their savings in fractional reserve banks, and allows negative interest rates.
See Tuur's posts on these recent IMF publications about negative interest rates and phasing out cash holdings.
Note this linked screen shot is from a [27th August 2018 IMF publication](

* **High priority recommendations**
*  (3). Individual identity. To counter the risk of identity fraud, we recommend that the Government introduce a plan that allows individuals to use a digital credential, biometrically secured to an individual’s own smartphone or connected device, for people to use in all their interactions with public agencies. Individuals would ‘own’ this credential, which should not be used to create government databases or to collect individual biometric data.
*  (8). **Moving to a near cash free economy**. **A $10,000 economy-wide cash limit should be introduced.**
*  (9). **Payment of wages into bank accounts** to increase transparency.
*  (10). Non-deductibility of undocumented contractor payments and **cash wages**

The problem is there is no way to test their claimed security.  Though unlikely they might be generating the private keys on an online windows XP PC.
They do have a multisig option I believe, but I haven't seen any reviews or code audits for its security and design.

I'll assume that means you're using MultibitHD.
Multibit (again because it is SPV) uses a mnemonic secret plus a time stamp (say you created the wallet on 1/1/2016 non of your transactions will be older than that age, without the timestamp the initial sync would overly stress bitcoin nodes tracing back from the genesis block)
As a general rule you NEVER want to export a private key from a HD wallet, because when combined with your xpub, a thief can generate all of your private keys.

Products like Piper and Entropy offer 1 click cold paper wallet creation. 
A single board computer running Linux can already run software wallets like electrum/armory/multibit.  If running Ubuntu 14 and Chromium 38+ then webwallets / web multisig wallets / hardware wallets work.

A paper wallet is as good as always.  You need a clean OS and need to be offline to generate it.  Booting a Tails ISO is one example.
Mycelium are on the verge of shipping entropy devices for this purpose, alternatively you could buy a Piper.
Hardware wallets solve the issue of paperwallets being impractical for spending (unless you use armory/electrum offline signing) you are importing your private key onto an online machine, you have the risk of losing the change accidently, etc.  
Trezor and Ledger are both very good.

You can find my installer script [here](
The C1 is a nice device, it has frequent Ubuntu 14 and Android releases and an active forum. The advantage of a up to date ubuntu distro is you can run Chromium 40.
Pi 2 is the same price, also has a quad core processor and has an active support community. There are many more accessories and addons available for Pi 2, but you are stuck with debian wheezy hence Chromium v22. This version is so old it is incompatible with the greenaddress chrome extension,  Chrome USBHID, has a ancient javascript engine and probably outdated crypto.
Overall i would still choose the Pi 2, as the C1 requires a micro HDMI adapter and a rare power connector. 
i havent epoxy'd mine, but it would be a method to prevent anyone from connecting your cold offline compiter to the net. (They could still eject the microsd card)

This sounds fantastic.  A convergence between Trezor+Nano+Unplugged !
















So I take it the firmware for the STM32 will be open source and users will be able to compile their own source code, whereas the secrets will be stored on the secure element ?
Is the secure element closed source? Will users be able to compile their own secure element firmware also ?
What's the advantage of the JTAG ? Presumably that is only for the microcontroller ?
Trustless : Is blue going to ship with read only microcontroller segments containing Ledger 's bootloader and public keys, like Trezor ? Or will there be no read only segments, allowing the user to write a custom microcontroller bootloader/firmware with their own public keys ? I have wondered about Trezor/keepkey shipping a blank device, but that might open the evil maid attack.
When developing secure apps - will that be like running fidesmo signed apps on Unplugged ?
Are there going to be 2 tiers of Ledger Blue, and if so what will be the differences ?
Edit : a few more questions
If sensitive storage and signing is all done on the secure element, how does the ST31 benchmark in comparison to Nano and Ledger HSM ?
When entering sensitive data into Blue, like a mnemonic or private key, will Blue switch into a TEE OS on the secure element ?
Will all secure element signing prevent Pass Phrase support ? BIP38 Recovery on device ? SSSS ? Can/does Blue run javacard apps like Google Authenticator TOTP ?
I take it Blue shouldn't be used to sign transactions containing hundreds of inputs [(such as a mining address)?](

I agree, Craig's actions seem ostentiously attention seeking as if he's channelling Steve Jobs on stage.
From the his unexplained panel appearance, to the elaborate tulip trust with 5-7 multisig, to the ? falsified PhD and Supercomputer. (Besides even if his 1.1 million BTC are held in a trust till 2020, they've never moved so he could have a backup of the private keys)
He's obviously been working on today's blog posts [since at least March](
Summoning Gavin and Jon months ago to now publicly testify their belief as part of the big reveal is reminiscent of Roger's YouTube video.
No way he accidentally made a false proof writing a few thousand words, diagrams, creating a new website including sample code when signing `Craig Wright, Satoshi` would have been enough.
Then he goes and does an interview on BBC and at the end says he will never do another interview ever again after this.
This IMHO is a deliberate smoke and mirrors hoax, one which Craig (and likely Jon and Gavin) will never directly answer.

There already exist "chip reader" [coinkite cards](  and the [Ledger proton]( NFC prototype. Greenaddress enables [instant confirmation](  without risk of double spends by using 2of2 multisig,  and the [BitID protocol]( allows you to login /authorize just by scanning a QR code on your smart phone (navigate to website on your desktop, scan in QR code on your phone app,  with no other interaction you're logged in -- now replace website with your car or house door, and QR code with an NFC device)

Yes, good points.  Kept it simple because the OP asked for the "easiest way".
Piper can produce BIP38 protected paper wallets, [entropy cannot](
I don't think there is a paper wallet way to generate a BIP32/39/44 HD wallet - you could generate such a wallet offline and export the xpub key, but then you still have the issue of spending.  Unless using hardened keys, [exporting a xpub and a single private key is a terrible idea.](
Same with [BIP32/39/44 scripts like this]( - there isn't really a paper wallet solution to this that doesn't involve importing your private seed mnemonic in order to spend.

FWIW they switched to the Microsoft Reference Source License, which is what Mycelium uses, and then only for a few days.
My impression is that they've only wanted to delay the arrival of clones, hence the bootloader source code was not initially released day 1.
That Trezor's source code is fully auditable and open source is of benefit to end users, the stack overflow and side channel oscilloscope attacks are closed largely because 100% of the code is peer reviewable.   The same is not the case for other hardware wallets.

Non address reuse provides privacy and some  resistance against future quantum attack. As electrum is a HD wallet, there is no reason not to use a new address each time, unless you want a static donation address for example. 
Electrum stores your private keys on your PC, so if you have keylogger malware, or a weak TeamViewer password, etc you're going to lose your bitcoin.
Electrum 2 (up to beta 2 public release at the moment) supports the 3 hardware wallets HW-1 (15€), Ledger nano (29€) and Trezor ($89) which means your private keys are not stored on your PC.
@_date: 2015-02-06 02:11:46
The danger with setting up a bitcoin software wallet on your everyday PC is that if you have keylogger malware a thief can steal your bitcoin. One bulletproof solution is to boot into a clean OS like tails, and offline generate a paper wallet (you can offline generate and send bitcoin to an address the world/internet/blockchain has never seen before).  
This script let's you setup a $35 single board computer to be your cold offline paperwallet generating / signing computer,  in under 1 hour.
@_date: 2015-02-11 07:54:26
You *only* need to import the private key into electrum *if* you want to spend the corresponding public key's bitcoin *from* electrum.  Electrum can calculate the public key from the private key. 
However the benefit of HD wallets like electrum is easy safe backups.  The best option would be to send your bitcoin from your non-HD address to your 1st electrum receiving address.

Armory Pi is the same as desktop Armory. The wallets are HD and allow you to export as a single file, or m of n files, or m of n paper wallets. You can also run Pi Armory in offline mode,  generate your wallet on the Pi,  export a xpub only file to your desktop/online armory for creating transactions,  and use your offline Pi for signing.

It can be difficult as the price of bitcoin can fluctuate minute-minute / hour-hour.
If you were purchasing something using a merchant gateway like bitpay/coinbase, they invoice you for a specific bitcoin amount and you have 15 minutes to make payment before the link expires.
If you are purchasing from an individual, you would want to make sure the vendor can't  scam you (consider escrow) and negotiate either a specific time the payment is to be made or a specific BTC price (ie : in localbitcoins trades, for an p2p transaction the trade needs to occur within hours of the transaction, or if is to be tomorrow, the price is at the BTC/USD rate at the time of the p2p meet).

Most likely scenario is the paper wallet will be lost in a few years time.
Lets say the federal mint is replacing the paper $50 note with a plastic polymer $50 note, so I gift you (as a baby) a freshly minted $50 paper note to hold on to as a collector's item.
99% chance it will be thrown out before your 18th birthday.

The mnemonic seed generated by electrum is NOT, BIP39/44 compatible. It will still use words, but something like 15 words (not 12 or 24)
The advantage of a BIP32/39/44 mnemonic is it is used by every hardware wallet, probably over 2.5 million units, and you will be able to recover it in 30 years time.
Electeum might disappear, like Multibit and Armory before it.

Solo mining is dependent on "luck" like buying a lottery ticket with impossibly bad odds of winning.  Pool mining is like joining a syndicate, so you are awarded winnings depending on your %share of the pool.  Your share with a GPU will be so low that you will never reach the threshold to be able to withdraw.

By epoxying the Ethernet and USB ports you would be attempting to prevent a casual attacker from connecting your cold offline Single Board Computer to the internet. (either by ethernet cable or USB wifi)
An unencrypted MicroSD card however is completely vulnerable to a thief ejecting it and reading the wallet.dat / default_wallet.dat / armory.wallet file.
You could protect it in an encrypted container, but generally the most secure method is whole volume encryption. I have NOT tried this on an ARM kernel, and dont know if the required kernel flags are enabled (you may need to build the kernel from source)
You could always keep your MicroSD card in a locked safe (or better yet your whole Single Board Computer)

If you have a clean airgapped OS, like a Raspberry Pi and my SBC script, that was designed to download everything you need and then go airgapped/offline forever.
If you need to go online again, such as to download a major version update to Electrum, then you just reflash a blank MicroSD with the latest Raspbian ISO, update, upgrade and git clone what you need.
`python-trezor` has a generate/test mnemonic python function. You can even feed it your own entropy (like coin tosses) whilst fully airgapped.
My SBC script does not include Coldcard, which wasn't invented yet, but there is a Coldcard software emulator you can run which will presumably allow you to generate a BIP 39 mnemonic seed also.
Send me a DM if you are interested in Cryptotab, I can tell you how to get a 10-20% discount.

FYI the bitcoin mempool is only a few MB at the moment
Setting a cap of 2MB, 32MB or 128MB doesn't suddenly solve problems. There many applications completely unsuitable for immutable distributed databases that store and verify every record and transaction for eternity.
There was recently exposed a startup using the bcash blockchain to timestamp financial data (the blockchain storing a timestamp and the data set like a financial price ticker).  Is if reasonable for 100,000 full nodes to store that for eternity ? Or for the startup VeriBlock to resell Bitcoin's network security (miners' POW) as a service to other companies by spamming the bitcoin blockchain ?
We can see with the last BSV reorg that there were &gt; 400MB of spam transactions mined in 8 blocks.
Even if Bitcoin had 64MB blocks, a 400MB spam attack would flood the mempool.  Bitcoin's low block size 1.2 - 2 MB with segwit is a feature where certain use cases like veriblock get priced out of the market.
I enjoyed 0 fee transactions back in 2013-2015, but this is not sustainable with a diminishing block subsidy longterm.

It's been many years since I looked at the Trezor code, but back then Trezor One was the only model.
Trezor One is not designed to be initialized airgapped without a PC, unlike Ledger and Coldcard that you can initialize with USB battery power alone.
Whether using the python-trezor command line scripts or wallet.mytrezor.io to initialize, there are 2 sources of entropy used to generate the mnemonic seed.
Back then (perhaps not now) the python trezor script displayed in the PC terminal the PC derived entropy, and the Trezor One displayed the ST microcontroller derived entropy.
Those two were combined to generate the mnemonic (which I also confirmed as a test by feeding the PC and Trezor derived entropy into trezor BIP39 sample script, producing the same mnemonic as python trezor initialization did).
Therefore the code snippet you've explained might not be whats used by the Trezor firmware, rather a call to the ST microcontroller random number generator instead.

It may be completely moot and have no security impact, but have you been able to confirm that your STM processor has / has not the same bootloader rewrite vulnerability ?
Edit : if somebody is glitching the microcontroller, that is a hostile attacker, non ?
Edit 2 : If the bootloader can be replaced on the STM chip, then an intercept attacker can replace signing keys 2-5, and release fake official firmware without the first reboot, big "unauthorized firmware" warning.
Perhaps the ultimate solution is to store the firmware signing key(s), or a hash of it, in the secure element. Or perhaps attestation.

I'm not aware of any penetration testing or published hacking attempts of coldcard
The coldcard does have one published signing key allowing 3rd party self signed firmware to run. As far as I can tell the only protection is the PIN which can bless a thirdparty firmware as valid "green".
On one hand an attacker with your coldcard and PIN doesn't need malicious firmware because they can spend, but a supply chain attack or phishing attack could bless malicious firmware.
If a coldcard owner is phished, and blesses malicious firmware, does this malicious firmware have access to the stored mnemonic ?

It depends what light wallet you are using. You might be using bread, electrum or coinbase wallet. They all behave differently.
Bitcoin is not for everybody. The masses would be better off using paypal/alipay/applepay for the next 5-10 years until crypto becomes more grandma proof.

Trezor come without firmware, but earlier firmwarea could be installed fully offline via the command line tools.  Fw 1.8.1 is.more complicated, because older Trezor ones came with bootloader 1.2.5 and 1.5 needing multiple restarts to ulgrade the firmware and bootloader. I don't know if that can be done from the python tools.
Coldcard is very good, provided you don't need a vendor webwallet / wallet app and have your own full node

Having higher tps, transactions per second, is only a minor feature of a coin.
Litecoin is the 2nd cryptocurrency with 2.5 minute blocks, yet litecoin's market cap is I think 4% of bitcoin's.
Bitcoin is valueable because it is scarce, decentralized, immutable, a store of value, secured by enormous proof of work, coin liveliness, and has outstanding code contributors.
The forks : feathercoin, bitcoin gold, private, diamond, black, cash, SV, etc do not share *any* of those properties.

This is for online trades, not person to person.
If you initiate a buy order to a list advertisement, the vendor pays the 1% fee. You have 90 minutes to make payment AND click in localbitcoins that you have paid.
If you initiate a trade but don't click "paid" the trade request will time out and the escrow coins will be returned to the vendors advertisement. 
(ie if they're selling 10 BTC and you click buy 1 BTC, their ad will update to 9 BTC. If the buy request is not completed in 90 minutes, their ad returns to 10 BTC. This can happening the advertiser is asleep or away from their computer for more than 90 mins)

There have been tampered with ledger devices shipped with a printed mnemonic seed in the box via ebay.
You can verify the Ledger is legitimate via attestation, and be sure to wipe it (incorrect pin 3x), update to the latest firmware and bitcoin app via **Ledger Live**, then generate a new mnemonic seed **on** the Ledger.

The biggest risk for most beginners is screwing yourself, and not from a theft by an evil hacker.
If you have a smallish amount, lets say &lt; 1-2 months' rent, then either a custodial wallet, or software wallet (desktop or mobile) are reasonable.
If you are asking about multisig, then then you either have more than 1 month's rent worth, or you intend to safe guard your crypto for longterm.
By all means, Electrum Multisig is one of the most common multisig setups for end users, you can run Electrum via Tails or a virtual machine.
I would not recommend Electrum to a family friend/relative or newbie because it is too easy to connect to a malicious public electrum server which could lie to you, log your addresses and IP, and push you an alert to download trojan stealing malware.
If you do want to safely generate electrum keys in a clean, airgapped, OS environment for longterm HODLing, I would suggest buying a cheap $35 Raspberry Pi and a few MicroSD cards.
You can install Raspbian (debian) on the MicroSD, `sudo apt-get update` `sudo apt-get --yes upgrade` and `git clone` the [latest Electrum release]( (currently 3.3.6).
Do that on each MicroSD whilst connected to the internet, then remove the Ethernet cable, and launch electrum.
These MicroSDs are to remain offline (not to connect to the internet) ever again.  You might then choose to store the MicroSD cards in a safe place, or to destroy them.
I wrote a [shell script]( years ago for this exact scenario (the hard links are all out of date, ie: electrum v2.5.4).  I haven't updated it because these days if you need to go to such trouble you should just buy a Trezor/Ledger/Coldcard hardware wallet (and a [metal mnemonic backup](

You can use something like this
I would use metal stamps and a 1.5kg hammer.
You could use the ziplock cable like the 3rd option, or just use nunbered holographic stickers.
You could then give the recovery seed to a trusted relative for safe keeping. If you wish use a passphrase, store that separately (not with the mnemonic)

Very different to Trezor with the inclusion of a secure element containing the PIN and Seed, and the red light.
However is the Bootloader re-writable as Trezor 1's is due to a STM controller bug ?


And if it could be replaced, and signatures replaced, would that make the red light go green (and create any vulnerability such as PIN brute forcing ?)
Is there and wipe-secure element protection, such as if it detects glitching, JTag or PIN brute forcing ?

Trezor links to 
Satoshi labs have answered that they do not log IPs or addresses on their backend, and by buying a wallet from them, you implicitly trust them.
Ledger connects to Ledger Live and again Ledger have replied that they do not track user's IPs or balances, and that their customer sales database is not linked to the wallet hardware.
Ledger + Trezor + Coldcard can all link to your own full node (+/- your own electrum personal server) to transact, but Ledger still needs to connect for some things to Ledger's HSM for attestation and installing apps (and probably for firmware updates)

There are network benefits with validating blocks, and also user benefits.
Fungability like dollar bills requires privacy.  If you connect to some random electrum server how do you know they are not logging your bitcoin IP and linking that to all of your wallets (where they can know all of your past and future transactions).
If bitcoin is digital gold, how do you verify you have legitimate gold and not a block of tungsten ? If you use a light wallet the node/server you connect to can lie to you.

On the hand if you have a $30 single board computer you can connect your mobile wallet directly to your own full node.

There must be something wrong if you are seeing no transactions.
I think multibit classic keeps a separate file (in one directory) for each "wallet"
So if you named them - coinbase, Bitstamp, localbitcoins, etc they would all have separate files.
Having said that multibit should open all the different named "wallets" that you've created by default, unless you've chosen to hide/close them.
Try navigating to your wallet directory and opening all of the "wallet" files.

Coinbase is a custodial wallet, like your online banking, once you have a few hundred dollars worth you should be your own bank.
The reason I mentioned Trezor one and Ledger nano S is that these hardware wallets are affordable, represent probably 95% of all hardware wallets sold, and provide a user friendly web wallet for their customers.
Other wallets like Coldcard don't offer a webwallet, so you need to use connect to third party electrumx servers, or run your own full node +/- EPS or Wasabi

There is a minimum number of full nodes required to serve SPV wallet clients, and right now only 1/10 full nodes forward port 8333.
Now there are 25+ million users on coinbase, 38M on blockchain.info, 2.5M on Trezor+Ledger, plus those using an exchange as a wallet.

Hardware wallets like Trezor / Ledger nano securely store private keys and sign transactions.
They need an online wallet to create the transaction to be signed, and then to broadcast the signed transaction.
For the online "backend" :
Trezor can use myTrezor / Bitcore / Electrum / mycelium / Copay / Greenbit / Greenaddress.
Ledger can use Ledger's Chrome extension / Electrum / mycelium / Copay / Greenbit / Greenaddress.

This is probably "as good as it gets" for now, but the only reason to have an offline machine is to avoid exposing your private key to trojans/malware.
We know there are malware which use botnets to mine for BTC, there is nothing stoping malware from targeting an offline electrum if you transfer back and forth a USB key.
Perhaps if there were a way for an app on an online device (computer or smartphone) to fashion the transaction and make a QR code for it, unsigned.  The offline machine then signs that transaction, makes a new QR code, which the online device reads and broadcasts the signed transaction.
TREZOR sounds like the best option in the future, and it can't come quick enough !

I worry too about hoarders and that if nobody is willing to spend their coins then the currency will fail.  However a blogger posted that in all likelyhood prices will still be quoted in USD/euro etc for the foreseeable future. Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places, so even if one coin is worth$10,000 it can still be used for a transaction in the same way as if one coin were worth $100. This is how bitpay works now. 
This chose number of total coins and 8 decimal places is quite brilliant.

The bigger risk is screwing yourself with a complex multisig arrangement, than theft from a hacker.
If you have a large amount, buy a hardware wallet and use a passphrase, for a smaller amount `python-trezor` BIP39 mnemonic, restore wallet mnemonic to Electrum (non-multisig)

Thank goodness for merged mining. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 07:10:49
There are risks with mining. 
Btcguild had great luck yesterday (at the expense of ither miners) and on the occasions I looked at blockchain.info, I saw btcguild with 1 run if 5 consecutive blocks and 2 runs of 4 consecutive blocks. The "six confirmations" for transactions may need to be raised for some transactions. 
A malicious well funded attacker might destroy confidence in the network.  Lets say a multimillion dollar hedge fund decided to order 1000 28nm wafers of chips, they could take &gt;50 network. There was a reddit post that the bfl 1 million was a down payment for 200-300PH of monarchs.
Malicious attackers - 50btc has been hacked repeatedly, bitcointalk hacked, blockchain hacked, android RNG hacked, everybody else DDOS. 50btc proposed there is an "evil pool". Now if evil pool were say 25% of network hashrate, and DDOS'd the biggest pool for an hour (and achieved a double spend) then DDOS'd the exchanges, bitcoin panic would break out. 
The biggest risk however is hoarding. Nobody will willing spend a BTC if they believe it will be worth $1000 next year, $10,000 the next year and $100,000 the year after.  Bitcoin may be gold 2.0 but it will never become a currency if everyone hoards.

Allchains.info predicted difficulty uses a "linear" estimation and has been underestimating early on in the period, but creeps up slowest towards the true difficulty.

Yubikey for 40% off, accepts bitcoin payments. There is a reddit post about this sale.

I don't know if disabling USB auto run is safe, but until Trezor is released, offline electrum (on a non windows machine) is probably the safest.

It would be nice to be able to view status and balances off the terminal screen (rather than forcing every menu option to output view the thermal printer). Ie has this non coinkite card been seen/accepted by the block chain. Do we need to print the status every 10 minutes ?

Can you give an example of exactly what people are doing to defraud you?
Are you selling bitcoin, and having people pay from hacked/stolen bank accounts ?
Like a PayPal chargeback ?

This has been discussed in detail here
Basically if the transaction limit were higher, the blockchain would grow at a significantly faster rate, network bandwidth would increase, people would abuse and spam the blockchain with spam. 
The limit can be raised, it can be compressed, clever people are looking at this problem. The world survived Y2K.

They're coinjar's bank (after CBA gave them the boot)

CBA is anti bitcoin, about 3 months ago when BTC was under $100 at bitstamp, they were already blocking international fund transfers to stamp's bank account in Slovenia. When I contacted them back then they confirmed they have banned cryptocurrency.

Order 11xx, but I have lower order numbers which have not delivered yet. 
2 Jupiters currently hashing at bitminter in the top 10 users . Over 900GH/s with 0.18% rejected shares.

What I would pay for it is hardly relevant. 
People want to own their property not rent it. My BTC is my BTC. 
In your interview you say the private key will be available for a low fee. If it is unacceptable I will not use your service and go with bitpay instead. Problem solved. 
What is your low fee.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:34:52
3-4 months ago I tried to make an international funds transfer to bitstamp (when 1btc was &lt;$100) and my Australia bank had already blocked transfers to bitstamp's account (and confirmed this over the phone after multiple transfer attempts failed).

It could happen to anyone, I made a panic buy in the GOX run up to $500, thankfully it kept going !
@_date: 2013-12-30 04:17:39
Best buy at the moment is the bitmain Antminer S1
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:33:43
I hope this doesn't become a trend or scam used by other companies. We have seen HF alter their TOS on the fly, and currently coinkite lists an account reactivation fee but that they can change their pricing at will




Who knows what the price for your private key is now - 0.5btc ? 1.1btc ?

Does it appeal to the average Chinese bitcoiner the brother of BTCChina's founder started litecoin ?

FUD for now.

+1 highly recommended. I would advise newbies to use escrow, don't open any attachments or links, and keep your LBC wallet at 0 most if the time (and enable 2 factor authentication)

How many cards will paid members receive ?
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:14:34
Ghash has had in their last 100 blocks on 7 times dropped their hashrate by between 500-2000TH, for one block
No mention of DDOS attack or hardware failure
Perhaps they were all double spend attacks by the pool ?

I believe in most transaction customers will not have a coinkite card. Even for Hudson's or Borders I am sure most buyers don't have a Loyalty card. 
Coinkite list the advantages of a POS include less staff training, less prone than a tablet to theft/breakage, but at least a tablet will give the retailer visual feedback that a transaction has been submitted and/or confirmed by the blockchain. 
When making a non-coinkite card transaction via the POS will staff need to login to coinkite.com to confirm the transaction went through ?

Like to see you do better, big mouth

They're not cornering the market on purpose. They're creating an optional product which has never existed before. Bitcoin has survived 5 years without a hardware wallet. Life will go on if you don't buy one. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:18:12
This has been discussed in other threads. The customer does not need to attempt a 51% network attack. They could make a 0 fee payment to the coffee shop (which could take many hours to be incorporated in the block chain) and double spend the same coins with a transaction fee. 
None the less, the % risk of that is probably less than credit card charge backs or phoney money.

How will overseas businesses use the POS to connect to the Internet. 
Would we buy a Sim can and subscribe to a local phone carrier to connect via GPRS ? Or do we program the POS to connect to a local wifi network.

So should we keep our POS locked in the safe after hours ?

Can you share exactly what was it you were doing on LBC to ear the ban ?
Were you buying and seeling BTC
Were you accepting bank-bank transfers, and if so what was your max amount per trade (ie: does it take a $5,000 or $10,000+ transfer before your account is flagged?)
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:04:03
That one time fee was 1.1btc, before this latest price crash. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:54:02
Looks like LBC sellers are getting scammed

There are 2 types of card correct, a private owner's card and customer transaction cards(that can be used on any coinkite terminal).
I thought the customer cards would work like a public transport card or a borders/Hudson's/etc loyalty card. 
Wouldn't we need dozens or even hundreds of the customer cards ?
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:52:01
CBA had blocked bitstamp from IFT back when the stamp price was under $100, I tried to transfer 3 times back then.
