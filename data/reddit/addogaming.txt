Fellow MTG collector here. Lands, Gods &amp; Walkers. Of course foils are nice too! I firmly believe a well preserved collection is a great investment for the future. I've been contemplating buying booster boxes in bulk and keeping them sealed for a few years.

Hi Brian!
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:42:18
Obtaining the license from the Central Bank in Abu Dhabi is my only concern at this point. To a certain extend operating a Bitcoing Exchange is in many similar to a traditional except for the fact that it's entirely online.
Another concern of mine is because the UAE *suffers* from a large exodus of money due to the fact that a large percentage of expats send a large portion of their salaries back to their home countries. A sum to the tune of 20 Billion Dirhams, annually. Due to this the country is planning to implement a heavy duty tax on funds leaving the country.
If I/we were to get things going, I would offer tens of thousands of people the opportunity to bypass the traditional system and hence avoiding traditional exchange houses such as WU. 
A simple transfer from their bank account to 'BitCoinME' with minimal charges and voila, off it goes. The plan is good, but there are organizations out there which do not like to lose business.

Hello! 
I am very aware of heavy regulations set forward by the government and my biggest concern is obtaining a license. Identifying a zone is also necessary, DIFC, DMCC or others. A local partner is a must and in the 17 years I have lived in this great nation I have seen my fair share of *things*.
Banks have been cracking down on Iranians, Sudanese and certain other nationals to comply with International *US* policies and such, so there are plenty of things to consider and yes, it might be very difficult to get this venture of the ground.
My biggest fear is that it will be operated by one of the *Merchant Families* and their trusted advisors. Let's see what I can do. I will PM you with more details in the future.

Well, spend about 50k on mining hardware which should get you ~10TH/s and would generate ~4.5k U$D per day. You would make your investment back in little under two weeks. After that simply donate half of your daily earnings to various causes whilst building up a nice little bank. 
I am aware of hardware depreciation, an influx of other potential TH miners and a large drop in BC value. Over time you would need additional mining hardware to keep up your rate of return. I guess this is something I would do..I'll just show myself out.

Same here :) mine mine mine!

The trick is to buy mining gear with fiat money and keep our coins in our wallets right? I am investing in 3TH this week, just wanted to see what you guys think. With the recent hearings and the way Bitcoin has been rising it seems to be the best investment I could make by a long shot.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:54:38
True, I guess it'd be due to the fact that I've mined for nearly 2 years and I'm comfortable with it. Though exploring other avenue's might not be a bad idea. Thank you, any recommendations?
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:18:02
You said it! The more the merrier right? 
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:43:46
Well there are ways and means to get funds in and out of Iran at this point. Let's say you get them to Dubai, you could give money to a friend who has an existing bank account here, wire the funds to let's call it 'BitCoinME' and then send it to which ever wallet you want. Maybe a bit more complicated, but yes once you own BTC you can move them wherever you please.
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:40:31
Thanks,  I'm currently out running a few errands. I'll give them a whirl once I get home.
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:14:24
There are a number of reasons, but my concern does not lie with Dubai or the UAE,  but the rest of the region. Population wise we are very few, with the likes of Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, the only exception being Saudi Arabia.
Though considering what this region and North Africa has endured over the last 24-36 months and people have other issues/concerns than Bitcoin. 
Iran and Egypt are the coutries that will bring the Bitcoin revolution to this part of the world, but it has to start somewhere and the UAE is ideal for that.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:32:21
I see your point and Lebanon doesn't sound like a bad place, but to be frank I would prefer doing it here in the UAE as I have the relevant powerplay needed to get this going. Though it might be an options if things don't work out here.

Technically I won't be selling anything to anyone. I shall provide a service to those who believe in the crypto currency. You might actually want to do some research on who actually funded Adolf, it will probably make you fuhrerious!
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:49:35
Hi there! Are you sure about those regulations on financial institutions? It would be interesting to see if things don't work out here if Bahrain could be an option.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:32:21
Hypothetically speaking:
In mid 2012 (1) BTC was roughly $5, meaning our fellow miner spent $50,000+ on gear in coins alone. If he would have kept his BTC and sold them at a price of 700, he would be a Millionaire at this point.
Though we do not know if we would have kept them this long or cashed out at 350 or earlier. With that in mind, taking into consideration his 25 THs setup, he should be able to mine at least 5 BTC a day, those calculators are giving me something close to 20, but we need to think about the increase of difficulty and other miners gearing up. 
In the grand scheme of things, if is able to mine 5 BTC a day at its current value he should still be able to recuperate his investment of $50,000 [50000/750] = 66.7 BTC [66.7/5]=13.5 days.
So it would take him roughly 2 weeks to make back his investment of 50 grand in BTC which he blew back in 2012.
I understand that we might not be able to make back his potential earnings of $7 Million, but he could still earn a pretty penny on the side and we don't know where BTC is headed..it might still be in its infancy.
Please tell me if I'm a complete idiot and correct me on my math (I've never quite figured it out).

Congratulations on your success and for doing your part to help Bitcoin move in the right direction. I believe you shouldn't change too many things in your life, but I do believe in planning for the future. Make the necessary preparations, I assume you are in your 20s possibly early 30s. Why not buy a house if you have the means? A good investment and a tangible asset. 
Treating yourself with a new watch, tv or whatever it may be  from time to time is something you *should* do. There is nothing wrong with that, you have earned it. Moderation is key and judging by your post, you should have no problems.
Be yourself and don't let anything change you, the girl who you will eventually marry is going to see past the Bitcoins and see the kind, mature and forward thinking person you are.
I believe in the Bitcoin and thr current crypto movement, but none of us know what will happen tomorrow, so be prepared Keep us updated from time to time!

I hear you loud and clear. I love the entire concept of Bitcoin and what it has to offer a 'tech savy' community, 'visionary' community and later the 'mainstream' community. 
I have been mining for some time and I enjoy the small reward I receive for my individual contribution to the network. It's not about the extra $12 or so at the end of the month, but about being part of creating something new/revolutionary. I have recently invested nearly 10 grand in new equipment because I believe mining will still be profitable enough for me to recuperate my investment and make a little extra on the side. 
I strongly believe the Bitcoin community is divided into a number of groups, which are succeeding/attempting to make everything 'work'. The miners, the merchants, the businesses,  the exchanges, the traders, the pool operators, the programmers &amp; developers and everyone else who directly contributes to the growth and success of the network. 
There are huge issues at this very point and there are going to be problems in the future,  but we are building something new and revolutionary. Some will make a fortune,  some will lose it all and there are those who see past the monetary incentives and temptations. 
I believe Bitcoin is going to succeed as a currency along with the traditional forms of payment. I also believe Bitcoin has not achieved its final form and/or purpose. Regulation should be minimal and only protect people within the Bitcoin network, politicians and others are concerned about criminals and stuffing their own pockets. Bitcoin should serve as an alternative form of payment, even if it *only* allows for the purchase of digital goods as opposed to digital and physical. 
Would it not make sense to have a certain type of currency for physical goods and services; and a separate currency for the purchase if digital goods and services? Everyone would be able purchase this digital currency through 'X', X is the unknown at this point, at least to me as I support the decentralized concept of the Bitcoin Network. 
Edit: Added/removed stuff for clarity.

Thanks! I shall keep you and everyone else posted on the progress I make!
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:58:42
Yeah I've heard a few stories and I hope it won't happen to me. Ordered a unit from bitmine today. Let's see! I believe I can make my investment back and a bit on the side..if not, heck I'll just leave it on and tell myself it'll work out. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:09:39
To be perfectly frank, I wouldn't mind if Bitcoin stayed out of the mainstream news and all for a little bit longer. The community is doing great and I feel mass exposure could hurt the network at this point.

Really? You sound just like some of the guys on CSPAN. *Terrorists* have means and ways to do what they like to do and they are doing it, they might already be doing it through existing exchanges. 
FYI it's Al-Qaeda.

25TH is insane! That must have cost you a coin or two, but still, do you believe you will make it back?
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:45:05
Yes, absolutely. It's funny how things work but I believe it's only a matter of time.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:08:01
Really? Maybe I'm not seeing something here, but I'm buying mining equipment with fiat currency, which is rapidly depreciating. If I were to spend 15k on mining gear with an ever increasing BTC, would it not benefit me in the long run? What am I not seeing?
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:20:55
I totally agree with everything you stated above and there are enormous challenges to overcome, but we have to start somewhere. In regards to the technical infrastructure, you are spot on. I am fortunate enough to be in the UAE, but as you've pointed out, other countries in the region suffer from bandwidth caps, slow speeds, unreliable connectivity and high prices compared to more established regions.
The mobile platform is key, though we are still in need of an exchange for people in the region to get their hands on actual BTC and get coins inside the network. 
Educating the masses, well where to begin. Organic growth seems to be the obvious solution. Start at Universities, hold workshops, create blogs in various languages. It's going to to take a lot of work, but what other choice do we have? Starting everything across the MENA region is not going to succeed, we need a starting point and then take it from there. Individual communities across MENA will have to communicate effectively in order grow this community.
Given the speed at which apps and programs are being developed for BTC and other crypto currencies, I believe new ways and opportunities will come to light in the near future. 
On a different note, how awesome do you think it would be if large/popular Sheesha cafes would start excepting BTC? The revolution would be unstoppable, but let's keep our feet on the ground.
