If you are saying that because the 1070 came out after the gpu days passed by then that makes sense but I used to mine with a cpu, and it wasnt terrible.

This logic is how you get a bubble. Like... Litteraly.


"You're dumb." Great one.


Yes some things go down too sharply and the market corrects but that's not any sort of guarentee. I would say this is your best argument though, it's an opinion instead of name calling and ignoring.


Well you might better order now so you don't have to wait in production line. I mean, you seem sure enough that you're a winner, doesn't that mean you already won?


Idk, just reread everything up to this point.
*I'm breaking this next one up*


Yes I agree, some people are just scared of the word digital.


A lot of people got rich off tulips, and a lot of people were left staring at a worthless pile of bulbs, the only diffrence between them being who happened to be holding the bag when shit hit the floor. Bitcoin has value, outside of just the value you have assigned it, I agree. It can be used to secure, anonymise and rapidly speed up transactions between you and your local store and just as easily between countries. But we both know that a lot of the people buying into bitcoin don't know that, they don't care, they are in the gold rush, they look at bitcoin and see digital gold, and they will dump it as soon as someone figures out how to put some teethmarks in it because they never cared about it and they just wanted a couple dollars.

It's volitile because idiots are driving it up, it would have been fine rising slowly but now everyone who reads about bitcoin now a days seems to think their idea of where it's headed isn't 5 years in the past.
