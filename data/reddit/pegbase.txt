oh i forgot
"Although relatively new, cryptocurrency is shifting the economic paradigm and that is reason enough for traditional financial organizations to start taking this seriously," said co-founder and early investor, Stuart Fraser, Vice Chairman and partner, Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. "With the marrying of innovation, technology, finance and regulation -- I believe that cryptocurrency can provide a value proposition that has never before been contemplated in global commerce and thus has the real possibility of being a viable mainstream currency accepted by the masses around the globe."""""

Yup a great great company displaying compassion and a human touch in a time of need.
Which is why it makes in so inconceivable that such an upright WS behemoth would be tricked by this H Josuha Graza. If you check the paycoin website their customers are screaming for 3 days now to get paid, to be able to log into their accounts to get their had earned money out.
Seems founder's nephew Stuart Fraser financined this sordid foray into Bitcoin and crypto currency from his CF accounts. No one is sure why other than his son is best friends with H Joshua Garza.
Single biggest failure in c-currency yet, the SEC is digging hard into what is going on as we speak.
