Ah right, yeah I see what you mean.

I think long term it is gonna blast off, I just wanna buy the dip to add that bit extra. I'll give a few weeks before I act I think. I want to make sure I understand more first. And let this current madness play out a little.

I'm still on top. I know I should get out while I can, but  fear its too late!

Any idea when this is going to drop?

Yeah thats what I'm thinking. I think its gonna tank for a bit too. I don't wanna chase the wave, I want to be ready to catch the next one.
For my level of investment, I'd be good just buying into Coinbase and leaving them there, or do I need to go the whole wallet route (don't fully understand this part yet). I've been having a look at GDAX too but maybe that's jumping in the deep end when I should be wetting my toes with Coinbase?

Big respect op. You should be an inspiration for anyone else who makes bank with cryptos

As a noob do you think its better to get in now, or allow this next few weeks and Futures to play out?
How closely linked are the altcoins? I'm thinking of buying some Ethereum and maybe Cardano. How much does BTC news affect the others?

You think his $40 is going up to $1000? In what time frame?
I'm starting to take a serious look at bitcoin. I remember listening to some guy on the Joe Rogan podcast years ago when 1 btc was $800 or something, then last week my mate told me he'd heard about this bitcoin thing thats about to go crazy. I think its time I started paying attention!

So you're saying the volatility is because its such early days? The hodlers are hodling because its going to plateu somewhere high up and the reason it tanks is because people are cashing in on the way or panic selling?
For it to be a currency it has to stabilise. We early adopters are gambling that its going to stabilise way higher?

I'm looking to get into this long term. I think its gonna be huge in the next 5-10 years. I'm not dealing with large amounts here, will probably sink somewhere between $100-$400. 
I'm getting the impression its going to drop this weekend/ this month, which would be the point I'd be looking to get in? Any advice for the first entry, timing and approach?
