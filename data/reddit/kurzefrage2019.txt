Quick question about LN. With Bitcoin I can install a wallet, have a friend send me some Bitcoin, and spend them in a store.
If  these should all be LN transactions, there seem to be additional  requirements/restrictions. I'm a bit confused. Could someone explain  them to me? As of right now, and, if different, in the future where LN  might be widely spread.
Two more questions.
1. I've  read somewhere that there was a BTC Bug, found and made public by a  Bitcoin Cash developer, that could have destroyed BTC. Is that true? Was  that Bug there from the Beginning or after Blockstream?
2. If  LN transactions are not traceable, how can people be 100% assured that  there never will be more Bitcoins circulating on LN than people actually  put on there/actually exist?

I mean lol @ Bitcoin as digital gold rather than p2p e-cash.
