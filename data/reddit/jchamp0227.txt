China's gonna wake up to cheaper bitcoins than yesterday. They have no attachment to the SEC decision.

Any hodler today didn't lose anything except for confidence in the SEC accepting and adapting to the future.

I love btc. By I also think bitcoin was made by government. Satoshi is the government. It came out right after the 2008 crash and it's the perfect world currency. It's completely trackable to a certain extent.just opinions. Still holding tho.

All of those headlines are purposely misleading. It did drop that much but for less than 1 minute.

Also, the SEC comment on fraudulent activity, the fucking stock exchange has more fraudulent activity than bitcoin. Their point here is moot. This is fear by the fed. Plain and simple. They're going to integrate blockchain tech in to their banking system and centralize it if they can, but don't want bitcoin as an official currency because they cant control the ledger system. The wealthy would all be accountable for their taxes year in and year out. 
Bitcoin will roll on. They can't stop it, just try to deter it when they can. I thought the price would drop to 800s and slow build but was surprised by reception. Only short term traders selling, longs and hodlers rejoiced for the small moment of cheap coins. Not cheap anymore tho. Back on track.

The people who join these groups are ultimately the ones who lose out the most. While the organizers plan pumps to benefit only the inner circle. I can’t believe people actually try to make money with groups like these.

Could you explain the difference? Not being sarcastic, I'm generally curious. I don't know the difference.

This is more than satisfactory. Thank you.
