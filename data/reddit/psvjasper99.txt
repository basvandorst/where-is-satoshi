Work for it.
@_date: 2019-11-16 16:09:02
Sounds like you are in for more than you can afford to lose. Never do that.
@_date: 2019-08-18 10:10:17
Because its fucking bullshit and no-one falls for it except idiots.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:34:37
That is not the point. The question does not make sense if one compares gains in BTC and USD without correlating BTC to USD at the same time.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:27:35
No because in the example you express LTC price in BTC and then say you remove 1000 dollars. If BTC price crashed and LTC-BTC only went up from 0.15 to 0.16, you'd have less than 1000 USD...

I love it how 90% of TA thinks the only way is up. It is biased as fuck and that's why no one buys it.
@_date: 2019-02-04 07:57:09
Nothing. I only lose money.
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:53:42
I spotted a filthy beggar
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:27:42
No its not.
@_date: 2019-02-05 11:18:35
Lmfao nibba that will never happen lmao I'd yeet a nuke at the KFC that fired me lmfao
@_date: 2019-04-05 06:06:09
There are only moonbois here trying to make a quick buck man...
@_date: 2019-04-21 21:20:20
No lmao
@_date: 2019-04-04 19:33:27
And you do this by placing a shady post on a shit sub.
I wish you the best in future entrepreneurial endeavours.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:21:17
Depends on BTC price.
@_date: 2019-01-29 10:04:02
@_date: 2019-01-07 11:22:49
He can. But he chooses not to.
@_date: 2019-01-29 11:31:34
Oh boy... just wait till we go to that fat sack he calls his tummy... MOOON
@_date: 2019-01-28 10:09:41
Bitcoin is not regulated. It has no rules. It is not illegal for a 14 year old to own a few dollars is it?
@_date: 2019-01-11 15:07:56
You're... you're a fucking idiot ��
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:58:44
This is not a matter of opinions but facts. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 21:39:28
Shut up Carlos

Now is not a bad time to DCA.

I dont have a fucking clue who that Bruce Wayne looking dude is
@_date: 2019-01-24 09:08:10
Make sure you don't keep your coins on an exchange. Secure your exchange login with 2FA! Keep your coins in an external wallet, hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano or Trezor or paper wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-15 20:04:24
Thats like 3000x the capacity of the computers 3 years ago
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:28:56
A week or so most of the time.
I suggest not using it anymore since the fees and rates are ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-01-11 15:24:08
The means you propose to achieve that makes you a fucking idiot is what I'm trying to say.
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:14:42
@_date: 2019-01-28 10:20:06
Well then they don't want to understand it. I face that too with mine. Their loss!
@_date: 2019-01-28 10:53:11
You could use litebit.eu
@_date: 2019-01-11 15:29:42
Nobody in the whole wide world knows who this sucker is. It is like saying my neighbour who has 2k insta followers says he likes bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-11 15:56:48
WOW thats so many! I have 2.3 times as much.
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:59:19
Smart people know in the first place that the exchange they send their money to is trusted...
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:22:24
Tron is the biggest pile of horseshit and thats why Ethereum abandoned it.
@_date: 2019-01-28 10:52:44
There is no such thing as 'legally' acquiring bitcoin. That is the beauty of it.
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:51:19
No. This is a major pseudo-activity. 0.1% BTC removed will not make a dent in exchanges.
@_date: 2019-01-28 10:23:26
Buying bitcoin is not limited to exchanges professor.
@_date: 2019-01-14 11:04:49
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:20:24
Well good luck to you sir.
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:04:31
One of the many threads on this: 
Exchange randomly shutting down a lot of accounts and removing withdrawal and deposit history. Whilst accounts are taken, funds are removed as well as the history.
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:15:34
Better than Batman?
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:54:17
Well HitBTC is something else but we KNOW that its fraudulent. You're not gonna expose Binance or Bittrex with it. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:14:15
Yeah because that defenitely won't get you shot
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:31:17
The majority of people who already have their funds on an exchange are traders and don't care about this.
The fact is that all of the intentions are good, but are totally insignificant. Not even a mere percent will participate. 
The upside is that there are probably retards sho send it to the wrong addresses so you might get lucky.
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:10:43
Well then please explain to me why most of the time when i tried to exchange for instance 200 USD of ETH to RDD, I only wouldve gotten 75 dollars worth?
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:10:04
My analysis shows that it will be somewhere between $0.00 and $1000000000000000000000000
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:15:51
I hope not since I'll be a trillionaire then...
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:20:02
Yes officer, this man right here.

Lower supply... I don't care!
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:33:41
Who's cutting onions
@_date: 2018-12-24 09:44:36
Usually USD price is fixed not the other way around.
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:58:34
Litebit.eu or transfer it from your bank to Kraken or something. Best wishes!
@_date: 2018-12-23 13:12:38
Well you go to the checkout and click "buy".
One day you have to pay a little more BTC and the other a little less.
@_date: 2018-12-22 23:18:03
Well you threw away money and don't care about dignity either apparently. Learn from your mistakes and move on, but don't come here asking for money. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 13:17:42
Well use it to your advantage. That is the thing about bitcoin and it still being early days. If you live in Venezuela and you buy a bread with 30 googol Bolivar, next day it might cost 30 googol^2.
Edit: now its already a googolplex
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:17:21
You're feeling fuck, yeah?
@_date: 2018-12-26 20:51:22
This is why the Dutch hate their capital, except for the 'tokkies'. (Google it)
@_date: 2018-12-22 13:09:46
There is no correlation. Try all you want to find it; it isn't there.
@_date: 2018-12-22 23:11:19
If you post this kind of self-pity bullshit then maybe you should not have money nor the right to exist in the first place.
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:45:20
Nice stat!
It does not buy us jack shit though. Maybe a döner kebab.
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:24:56
Local kebab here is mohammeds shit.
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:50:44
A number 7?
I'll have two Number 9's, a Number 9 Large, a Number 6 with extra Dip, a Number 7, Two Number 45's, one with Cheese, and a large Soda.
@_date: 2018-12-22 14:05:36
Bless you.
@_date: 2018-12-31 19:19:14
WE ARE GONNA GO PARABOLIC WOOO
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:08:12
This doesnt predict shit
