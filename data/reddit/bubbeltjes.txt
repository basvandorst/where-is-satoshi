The monetary cost is just one aspect. The cost to the environment in places where non-renewable energy is used is another:

Yes, at which lots of people will be sitting around with useless bitcoin specific ASICs that are too expensive to run. Unable to sell off as well, huge loss on investment.

it's only a loss when you sell those down positions. Alts will probably recover. Don't sell at a loss.

Same problem here. I got robbed over 2 months ago and opened 3 tickets. Still nothing.
I have some coins left in there but what's actually more important I need my account history for my tax declaration.
I was unlucky enough to get my phone with 2FA AND my laptop stolen which had the backup of the 2FA key. I was on vacation and normally I backup to another disk at home, but that didn't get done yet as I had changed the 2FA while traveling.
I sent a last mail about 2 weeks ago, with this:
Hi, over a 2 months ago I was robbed of my laptop and 2FA device. I need
to have my Poloniex account suspended, and my 2FA bypassed so that I can
change the password.
I've opened several tickets with Poloniex support and there was ZERO
response. Other exchanges have all responded within hours, at the time.
It's now a month later and still NOTHING.
The tickets:
The only response I got was in the first ticket, and it mentioned that
"A support agent will contact you as soon as possible via support ticket
[ in the mean time please reply to this message once you
complete the above security measures or if you encounter any problem."
I did reply, but nothing ever came back. This is really bad customer
What can I do to resolve this? I want access ASAP. I also need this for
my tax declarations.
This is really terrible, and I am glad that I only had about $100 worth of coins left in there. I would advise anyone to never leave any coins in Poloniex for any amount of time longer than strictly necessary to do your trades. I have since then not been trading there anymore.
Bitrrex, Kraken and Bitfinex all treated me very well, I got this situation resolved within a week. Poloniex is a nightmare. This shouldn't take 2.5 months already. If anyone from Poloniex is reading this. Please help!
Thanks.
