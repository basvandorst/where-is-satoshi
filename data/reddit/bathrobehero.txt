Just use lower fees godamit. Fees are only really high if you want your transaction to confirm quickly.

It's not blaming, but people should know better than to store funds in custodial wallets. Essentially, you do not own coins stored in a custodial wallet.
The owner of the private keys (nicehash in this case) does and you're just trusting them with your funds. Not having to rely on trust is one of the basic fundamentals of crypto and giving that up is just... a bad idea.
It might be dickish to point that out but it's necessary that people understand it so they'll be safe next.
Also, nicehash having ~4700 Bitcoins in hot wallets (as in, on online machines instead of in cold wallets that are not connected to the internet) is a stupidly amateurish thing. This even could have been a planned, inside job, we'll never know.

Fair enough, and of course diversification is key but my comment was a reflection to most of the comments, not just yours but calling it myspace is why I commented to yours.

But then it's deflationary for everyone so it doesn't really matter.
Everybody has to spend money on stuff they need and the deflationary rate is the same for everyone. If everyone would have Bitcoin, it wouldn't matter if something would cost 1 BTC or 0.01 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:47:18
Yes, but not as delusional/annoying/childish as btc and cryptocurrency though.
I'm frequently tempted to block all 3 and just stick to btctalk. All the readers of these 3 subs combined are just a tiny vocal insignificant minorty but somehow everyone's convinced they know what's best for the silent majority of Bitcoin users. And then there's all the drama, attacks, bullshit, spam overshadowing the rare constructive discussions. I mean this is a good post but people are defending insider trading in the comments... It's just retarded, really.
Edit: fuck it, blocked all three, these subs are just a waste of time. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:58:03
If everyone would only use Bitcoin and there was no USD as in the hypothesis above, steel's price would also increase. And the price could very well go 1/10th instead of 10, in which case you would have benefited from spending.
And if everyone would have Bitcoin, an equilibrium woulb be reached.
Again, a loaf of bread costing twice as much as it did say 5 years ago in an inflationary system is the same as it costing half as much in BTC in a few years time in a deflationary system.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:03:30


You can't and you shouldn't. Crypto is trustless, and the services around it should become trustless too.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:29:44
It can and it is both. People have needs and stuff to pay for. It can go 1/10 or 10x so holding because of volatility instead of spending when something needs to be paid for is pointless.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:26:15
Only the tiny vocal minority (aka. reddit and forums) feel that way. They also feel they know better and know how the rest of the userbase feels and what they want. All of it is untrue regardless if some people in this online bubble agree with you.

That doesn't matter at all, that would just make the remaining Bitcoins that much more valuable for everyone equally.
If everyone would have BTC, it wouldn't matter if something would cost 1 BTC or 0.01 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:14:30
But people have needs and have to pay for their expenses. And it's not like people who hold will end up with more. The *rate* of the value of Bitcoin changing would be the same for everyone.
The whole country wouldn't and most importantly couldn't just hoard it. And even if they would, it wouldn't matter. A currency that isn't heavily circulated (not always spent by everyone) is still a currency and I don't see anyone wrong with that.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:58:27
Why go all in though? Even if you believed the BCH nonsense, going all in is a terrible mistake.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:35:44
Probably there are more transactions on the first workday after two days off.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:11:21
I think miners are irrelevant in the issue as they are capped by the combination of the block size and block generation time. They can't process more transactions.

The mining performance of a PC against even an older ASIC is just so bad in comparison that no matter the difficulty is, the PC never will be profitable. Unless the few satoshis you would mine with a PC would worth so much to turn a profit, at which point even old USB ASICs probably would earn millions.

But tracking is just speculation *in terms of ownership*, it's not 100% reliable.

That is true but conversely, having lower block reward would also achieve reduced volatility which would in turn would greatly increase the confidence in the coin for some, leading to worldwide mainstream status.

@_date: 2019-03-07 22:59:25
I know I'm very late but 2FA saved me as the bogus client asked for 2FA on launch which was more than weird so I didn't give it and that saved my funds.
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:19:28
Yeah but they addmittedly can't really prevent these messages so maybe they should have removed them altogether. It's an obvious attack vector even if it relies on users being dumb.
Imagine people only launching the wallet every few months, expecting an update and since the update comes from the software it's not hard to get caught.
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:54:25
Thanks for the explanation. Problem is most people I know and use Electrum are older or not that tech savvy and barely even know what reddit is, let alone frequent the sub for warnings.
It was hard enough to move them away from sketchy web wallets.
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:08:22
Yeah, I'm fine and moved my funds to an offline computer and several other sources say the malicious wallet doesn't have anything persistent (probably to not get caught by antiviruses). I'll be formating this PC though.
Never seen an Ethereum broadcast message which let my guard down. But honestly, I'm quite disappointed by the lack of action from the dev team as I just learned how many people got tricked by several waves of these phising attempts for many months now.
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:17:02
Well, I think the same but since I have 2FA I'm not really scared, it would have to be a very sophisticated and fast acting malware to not just beat me typing my 2FA but it would also need to replace the transaction before that.
I'll likely do a format just wondering how severe this stuff was.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:43:26
That's the worst idea. I mean you'll get the info but you'd have to shovel tons of shit to find it.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:03:32
Yeah but it will take ~11 hours for 20 confirmation to deposit to Bittrex based on the projection since BCH's difficulty floored 17 blocks/10 hours ago.
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:31:34
So an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:49:42
What exactly do you want from Bitcoin? Paying for your morning coffee? Then BCH is crap because of the 10 minute block times, use an altcoin instead with ~1 minute or lower blocktimes. It's not like you'd pay for your morning coffee with shavings off of a gold ingot either.
So with BCH you only caused confusion, disruption and have a short term bandaid solution for high fees. (And just because BCH is currently not flooded with microtransactions doesn't mean fees will remain low. It could be attacked just the same as Bitcoin was/is to promote BCH but currently nobody is interested in flooding BCH). Why the BCH camp didn't go further and decrease blocktimes instead of blocksizes? 1MB blocks per 1,25 minutes andm 1/8 reward per blocks for the same rate of transactions and emission and much faster confirmations that can be used for microtransactions? They didn't because it was either conceived by dumb people or designed to fail.
But no, it only has one questionable benefit which comes with the disadvantage of being a useless new coin riding on the back of Bitcoin - just like every single altcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:25:41
Pruning could be very dangerous as I'm told.
And with 10 minute blocktimes Bitcoin is not designed to handle very time sensitive payments - such as your morning coffee.
It's not like you're paying for your coffee with shavings off of a gold ingot either yet it has its use.
I don't think Bitcoin should aim to cover microtransactions and time sensitive transactions. There are hundreds of altcoins better suited for that.

I seriously have no idea. On one hand I think it's overpriced, but on the other hand in a few years if we get more adoption and after the next block reward halving it might go super high.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:15:39
Not subjective at all. BCH split off/forked off/copied BTC.
Go spew petty crap in the other sub.

@_date: 2017-08-05 21:07:25
Why would there be an energy crisis when miners use all kinds of energy sources and renewable energy is getting cheaper by the day and there are miners already using them? Hashrate would just drop and the difficulty would adjust and we might need to increase confirmation times to trust transactions but that's all.
Even if electricity would cost 10x or 0.1x times of what it is today an equilibrium would soon be reached. There's no scenario where all miners just stop.
And your workforce/worktime comment doesn't make any sense to me.
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:10:45
I'm pretty sure most people who HODL mean they're holding a significant amount (relative to the person). That does not exclude spending from it for stuff, simply just not selling a huge chunk or even all for FIAT/gold/etc.
@_date: 2016-12-17 00:43:04
Because its current market cap is $12.59 billion which is a crazy amount of money.
But then again, looking for some quick comparisons it's not *that* much. For example, Paypal's market cap is 47.43B and Western Union's is 10.21B. And arguably Bitcoin is superior to them.
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:37:35
There's no reason for it to get pushed nowhere near as high anymore. And such a high rally would be detrimental to BTC. in the public eye.
But it's a much more established currency now and I'd like to think people have more reasonable expectations so it shouldn't go crazy.
@_date: 2016-12-14 05:58:08
Even fucking greater if you ask me. Though I personally do not believe the current price represents the long term price.

Jesus, people are going ballistic over nothing. I, for one completely agree with you but people can't seem to see your reasoning over their pitchforks. This place is indeed for discussions, not for promoting software that would split bitcoin in two.

8MB support =/= XT.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:41:13
...with the current number of transactions. And nobody's disputing that. 
The point is to be able to handle the theoritical maximum of 8MB per block regardless of the likelihood of that happening.
But at some point in the future, potentially the 8MB block size limit won't be enough due to the amount and size of transactions so we might as well take it and its effects on running a full node into account now.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:15:43
The stupidity here is unbelievable.
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:37:59
But that's the easiest way to refer to it. And in a sense it is a balance and while the wiki says it's a ~~meaningful~~ *meaningless* number, it kind of isn't.
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:29:41
It's not tested and it could cause fatal issues to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:12:32
There's not much point in running a node that doesn't support **theoritical** values.
Doesn't matter if the blocksize stays as low as it is or magically changes to 8mb, the point is if you run a node, you might as well run it in a way that works either way.
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:38:03
You don't know that for sure, that's the point. We can't just change things willy-nilly hoping for the best.
The price of bitcoin on the winning fork can also drop drastically at which point that 80% hashrate and difficulty decrease on the losing fork might be more profitable even with cheap coins for miners and then it will be a race where no fork will come out winning. And if there will be unexpected major, but not fatal issues with the winning fork, the losing fork won't be abandoned for sure.
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:34:26
If people wouldn't just happily jump on supporting a fork without having any idea what it could cause, I can see why it seems easier to just shut it down regardless.
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:40:02
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:34:48
But fees aren't high.
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:42:30


So let's risk killing a $4bn market cap coin with an untested fork.
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:59:54
Doesn't matter if the blocksize doesn't jump to 8MB, node owners have to use theoritical numbers for safety.
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:25:05
Except even after XT would won, Core could overtake XT weeks or months down the line if it produces the longest chain. Let's say XT wins, and Core supporters dump a lot of coins on the XT chain. Then XT price will tank and miners will start mining Core again because that's more profitable. Again, if one of the chains is not guaranteed to die quickly, we will end up with two coins. And that is just one possible outcome out of dozens so it really isn't that simple to just change a number from 1 to 8 but thanks to stupidity and mob mentality most people believe starting an XT node in 2 minutes is the best thing they could ever do.
@_date: 2015-08-13 12:39:54
Because that's a retarded post.
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:09:06
If one of the forks wouldn't die quickly then there would be two coins. There's no way core will go down without a fight so yes, if XT happens it will be an alt splitting bitcoin in two.
We're talking about a $4bn market cap coin here and gangs of idiots thinking everything is so simple and unable to look past personalities...
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:33:12
Bit of an over exaggeration going there with the *hours between block* part. Block interval slowed to ~19 minutes ([source]( which is all back to normal since BCH's diff jumped to by exactly [four times](
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:41:06
It's a $4bn market cap coin and an untested fork. Pulling the trigger and hoping for the best instead of careful planning is hostile.

Thanks for taking the time finding it. Yeah, that's a very long time though that happened in the past even with regular blocktimes, but of course it's different if ~half the miners stop mining.

Changing the algo would cause even more centralization of mining since people know what Bitcoin is capable of and a few people with the deepest pockets would be the first to pay for their own ASIC R&amp;D's and therefore control the network and manipualte the coin completely. The first time around the evolution of mining hardware was natural, the second time people would be prepared and rape Bitcoin.

Are you really that thick? The currency is decentralized but the subreddit is a subreddit which is intrinsically a centralized forum with a certain set of rules and it's not the currency itself.
@_date: 2015-09-19 11:32:35
Get out with that nonsense. This is a subreddit just like any other with a certain set of rules and not bitcoin itself. Don't want censorship at all? How would you like every post to be an advert for some shady referal site, ponzi, porn, phishing, etc? Censorship is needed and if it's disclosed it's perfectly fine.
However you look at it, XT was a hostile fork and was banned because it was pretty much spamming the subreddit and a lot of people started to support it without even having any idea at all what it would mean for bitcoin. People acted like tehy were all the people in the world using bitcoin completely disregarding everyone else in the ecosystem.
The same people are still doing the anti-Theymos circlejerk, disrespeting, shaming, name calling people, coming up with conspiracies, supporting XT just out of spite and feel entitled for no reason without any understanding of the decisions while it has been explained several times. I mean just look at your comment, how childish is that to bring up someone's age in an argument?

If only there were *thinkers* and not just morons.

$400 *is* the moon - for now. Another short lived burst which is unsustainable followed by a deep crash will just turn more people away from bitcoin. Slow and steady is the only way people will take it seriously and not just look at it as gambling.
@_date: 2015-11-05 22:09:01
If it was that black and white there would be more than 7.7% nodes and 0.2% mined blocks by XT, don't you think?
You probably don't know any of the implications of a fork, let alone such an aggressive one as XT and just only see that the number 8 is bigger than the number 1.

Imagine if they would also auction all the drugs they seize.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:37:32
I'm talking about the whole package.
@_date: 2015-11-05 22:27:52
Too bad. 5 minute blocks with half the reward would also help a lot with confirmation times and while the blockchain size would grow twice as fast, it wouldn't be an issue. Processing power, memory capacity per price, storage and internet bandwidth are all advancing in a much higher rate. Blocksize increase though would require faster internet as opposed to sending half the data twice.
What are the arguments against it?
@_date: 2017-05-07 00:58:56
Interactive billboards.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:30:11
There's really no hurry. XT is too aggressive and ignores lot of aspects therefore it will never happen.
@_date: 2017-05-07 00:59:46
Sure, there's greed but you couldn't be more wrong on both of those counts.
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:14:26
Not really.
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:47:11
Too many inputs.
@_date: 2015-11-07 01:08:52
Hahh, the only thing hurting bitcoin would be XT but it will never happen so it's fine.
@_date: 2015-11-06 00:13:52
Better than a bunch of morons spamming the sub because that's what that would lead to.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:18:15
He said catastrophic. Pay the fees and you'll be fine and generated dust and microtransactions will get out and make way.

It is, but it's a clarifiaction implying there's nothing out of the ordinary here.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:39:15
I'd love if BTC could be used for dust transactions as well, but it simply can't work.
We have to have a transaction fee market.
Otherwise people could spam the network cheaply, or on-chain servies like BTC casinos, lotteries, dice games and similar services revolving around thousands of micro transactions would naturally spam it and we'd be back to square one.
@_date: 2015-11-05 22:05:47
Thank that to the people who were spamming the sub with it.
@_date: 2017-05-04 02:31:09
Not really, gold is just... gold. Heavy, hard to transport, easy to steal, arguably centralized, supply unkown, etc.

@_date: 2017-07-29 02:34:18
Of course not everyone spammed the blockchain, but the few that did helped made their point against them.
Again, let's say if we would have 1000 MB blocks right now and block sizes would be 1/1000 of what they are now. Then with a simple script and some bandwidth you could spam the blocks full and therefore increase the transactions fees for the same amount of BTC as you would with 1 MB blocks. BTC is simply not for dust transactions and some people can't understand that. There are hundreds of altcoins for that.
Even if you pay let's say for the argument's sake a 1 BTC fee for your $3 coffee; if miners don't find a block for 30 minutes due to variance, your transaction won't be confirmed regardless of fees.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:27:49
You're right, it is a fork but historically fork implies a win or fail state - or reusing the codebase in a fresh project. 
It's more like a split.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:06:07
Gavin did that to himself.

Way to be overly dramatic.

It won't be as far as I know.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:29:10
It's detrimental to Bitcoin so of course people are bashing it. It's an intrusive, braindead fix to a non issue.
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:36:34
One coin is ~633 USD. That's pretty fucking great if you ask me.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:42:25
[I don't know about that](
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:23:08
It's not as much of a fork as it is a split. A fork generally implies a win or fail state.
So of course people are bashing it; it's an altcoin supported by mostly delusional people and it's detrimental to Bitcoin.
The blockchain was spammed every time there was a proposition, be it XT or BU. BTC had 120k+ unconfirmed transactions and now that it's clear they're both dead we have currenclty 5.3k unconfirmed transactions. Yet the price is still high.
And if 1 MB blocks can be spammed, if the block size would be 8 MB and therefore following the main argument, transactions would require 1/8th of the cost, guess what, 8 MB blocks can be filled with spam for the same amount of money. Even gigabyte blocks could be filled for the same amount. 
There has to be a transaction fee market. BTC is not intended for your coffee or your tacoo. Especially not with 10 minute block times. Same as you're not paying for them with shavings off of a gold ingot...
So yeah, 8 MB blocks will solve nothing, regardless of how loud the vocal minority screams about it, acting as if they know what's best for people who actually use Bitcoin and not just argue about it on a couple of message boards.

23k satoshis.
And if the price increases for example 10 times we can all just use satoshis.
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:48:56
It's even more confusing, just use satoshis then.
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:57:08
Which site is that screenshot is from?
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:46:53
No, it's even more confusing for some.
BTC or satoshi.

Hell no. Selling at a 80% loss is silly in crypto.
Holding when you're already way up but want more is the hard part.
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:57:33
It's almost as if way more people would use Bitcoin worldwide than a few dumbasses on a couple of BTC forums who think they know the answer to everything.
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:34:09
It is, thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:01:20
They have nothing to do with the price, the people who use BTC does.
