clinical therapy =/= abusing MDMA. Best to let the scientist and therapist work on this to help our Veterans and people who suffer from traumatic brain injury bub.

"We found that low doses of MDMA (between 50 and 75 mg) were both
psychologically and physiologically safe for all the subjects."
that is from MAPS [white paper]( on the study
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:55:56
FDA trial was fast tracked with the political help of the Pentagon working with MAPS.
In MAPS' completed Phase 2 trials with 107 participants, 61% no longer qualified for PTSD after three sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy two months following treatment. At the 12-month follow-up, 68% no longer had PTSD. All Phase 2 participants had chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD, and had suffered from PTSD for an average of 17.8 years.
That is 68% efficacy for cases that were **treatment-resistant** big difference and why the FDA has gave it the Breakthrough Therapy Designation.

Take 5-HTP and L-Tryptophan post clinical dose and its not a big concern. The major issue comedowns are due to high dose and repetitive use, depleting all your serotonin.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:49:22
Fortunately for us the Pentagon is working with MAPS to push this through the FDA trails, then the DEA will have to reschedule because that is the hoop they set up to prevent rescheduling because it is so cost prohibitive to do 7-5 years of FDA trails (millions of dollars). 
Sessions will not go against the Military Industrial Complex he doesn't have the political capital.

because the people who need it also could use some therapy along with it, instead of taking unknown quality of a substance that will get you locked up and cost you thousands in lawyer fees to fight the criminal charge if caught with.
the FDA isn't getting rich off this they do research, and MDMA has been around for 100 years Merck of Darmstadt, Germany are the (lapsed) patent holders of MDMA. So no one is going to get super rich off this.
Stop trying to prevent medically viable tools for the sake of "cheeper" "easier to get" (hard to believe that one) MDMA. Its counter productive.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:15:51
did you abuse MDMA?
are you sure you got unadultered MDMA?
These are clinical MDMA trials with lab grade pure doses and relative small amounts. Much different than taking MDMA from an unknown vendor in an unknown dose.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:30:02
MAPS is about as legit as they come, Rick Dobins who founded it has been at this since the early 80's fighting the good fight against the DEA to reschedule drugs that have major medical impacts especially in psychotherapy which is about to go through a revolution because of their work.
If the Pentagon is working with MAPS to help with PTSD, people will know this is serious work with lots of capital to see it though.

[brain concussions (TBI) lower T levels]( lots of boxers and MMA fighters are probably using testosterone supplements to try and prevent the lower levels of testosterone due to brain trauma.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:53:54
In smaller doses and takeing a post supplement of 5-HTP / L-Tryptophan (building blocks for serotonin) will mitigate the bad effects of low serotonin levels post MDMA use.
it still is slightly neurotoxic because it can pass the blood brain barrier but again in small clinical assisted doses it is a near non issue, it becomes an issue if taken many times in higher doses.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:35:15
how much?
probably not the 50-75mg these clinical trials are testing. My guess is you took upwards of 125mg.

currently clinical FDA trials only unfortunately, give it 1-2 more years for Phase 3 to complete and you will be able to find therapist to do MDMA sessions with you.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:34:25
Only 1- 2 more years for Phase 3 and you will find therapist who will be willing to work with you.
It sucks that the DEA has made them jump through all these hoops to reschedule drugs with medicinal benefits ,but its just the crazy war on drugs world we live in that hopefully won't be around much longer.

FDA trials take 5-7 years (5 years for this one because its fast tracked with help of the Pentagon) not 10 years.
You can thank the DEA for the constant goalpost moving on rescheduling requirements in the US.
Nothing is stopping other countries from rescheduling, it just requires someone use it for research or medical purposes.

NYS DFS, they are requiring a BitLicense to innovate within NY. This essentially will drive all business or people willing to do business within NY with bitcoin out of the state because each new innovation or update would require NYS DFS to sign off on it which is silly archaic and asinine. You can't expect regulations that work with banks to have the same effect with Bitcoin its a protocol essentially a language whose freedom should be protected not required to meet some Licensing rules because that is what worked for banks in the past.

so far my hashlets are 10-15% more profitable per MH/s than my miners at the house, (25 MH/s hashlet vs. 30 MH/s falcon/3xfurys). The big difference is the zenpool has 20-30% higher payouts than virtually any other scrypt pool easily makes up for the maintenance costs. 
The fact that you will be able to upgrade and trade in hashlets in the future when more efficient units are out is really what got me to buy into them. So far haven't been screwed by GAW through buying miners or their cloud service.

I would think the killer app for google wallet would be to use btc to usd transfers like bitpay except with app and a physical card at retailers that don't necessarily accept bitcoin or even know what bitcoin is.
You would think a company with goggle's marketcap wouldn't be hard to scrape up a few million for liquidity, they already are pushing buttercoin and ripple labs through goggle ventures so they could use that as a springboard for an exchange.
They need to start going with the flow of opensource disruption when it comes to G-wallet instead of just trying to be another paypal/applepay with it.

people treat bitcoin as an investment, but people also buy goods and services with bitcoin as well. Mass market adoption might never happen but if it does expect the value to rise long term. It is a risky investment but also a groundbreaking technology, just how much is that worth in the long run as an investment could be irrelevant.
 If you want strong investments don't look here go elsewhere, if you want to see the technology develop and possibly change the landscape of online currency exchange grab a seat buy a few bitcoin here and there don't treat it like a nest egg.

have had nothing but good experience with GAW so far, I have bought hardware and cloud mining products.

I would use my Google wallet so much more if they integrated a bitcoin wallet, its already got a debt card so if they could make it so they handled the btc to usd for any purchase (its not like they don't have large amounts of cash to facilitate this hell even charge me a fee i wouldn't mind). It would probably make Google wallet so much more attractive, As it is now all I do is pay friends money I owe them and roomates for utilities so i don't have to run to the ATM.

Fedex or UPS are not "actively fighting" its the ATF and at best they really only screen overnight shipping more than the millions of packages that get shipped through standard shipping. People seam to think all the packages get scanned or checked but that would be impossible to do that and try and run a business with less overhead/people on payroll.
