Lol I have aged 50 years in a this horrible week.
I am to stubborn to sell until I atleast break even. 
All because I bought the fake dip!!!!!! 
:(

Uhhh my man... Coinbase fees are so extreme and they don’t show the accurate amount. 
When you buy you must buy really low, when you sell you must sell really high, the dip is not over...

Looks at the people that bought at 20k 
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:44:34
We are all guessing at this point. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:29:55
Well jumped in at 11200 could be better. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:11:14

@_date: 2018-02-25 12:43:23
Fuck sake sell again bruh!

My predictions have been correct which is most likely a bit luck and a bit knowledge. 
My lines are not drawn randomly, they are drawn according the Elliott wave theory and a reverse head shoulder pattern. The green line represents a barrier.
The yellow line represents the neck of the head and shoulder.
I am just speculating actively watching behind some glass.... do with this information as you wish.
Make sure to let me know if this helped you in the long run! 
A completely unbiased view...
