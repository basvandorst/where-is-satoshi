You said a whole bunch of stuff but I don't really understand why USD being printed means bitcoin is better, or why there being a finite amount of bitcoin makes it good?
Here's why people are bullish about bitcoin: They don't understand currencies or money.

Stupidest shit I've ever read

I don't understand your point.

They're already extraordinarily transparent. Anybody who is in favor of "auditing the fed" (more so than it's already "audited") is at best uninformed on the situation, or is at worst an ideologue willing to jeopardize economic stability for political gain. Or, third option: An idiot.

I just explained why they're not opaque. They have a clear mandate and are very explicit about how they go about achieving it. 
As far as my statements, too many people parrot the bullshit that wouldn't exist if people actually researched these issues and discussed them in good faith. It's absurd they have to trot Yellen up (and Bernanke before her) to be "grilled" by people who don't know their ass from a hole in the ground, and talk over her responses condescendingly as though she's on trial or something. It's preposterous. It's a level of discourse that we waste time on for no good reason.
