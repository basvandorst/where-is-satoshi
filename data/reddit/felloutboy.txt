is home to the nascent PR &amp; advocacy group. In time I'm sure the various groups from each coin will find a path to what you suggest. We're just getting started and we are taking it seriously.

The one problem all cryptos have over fiat currency is that of control.
All fiat is firstly and lastly controlled by an issuing state (nation) and mostly those nations have central banks, who in turn are acting in the interests of the local banks (and in the national interest) who in turn are trying to make profits from their customers (us).
The paradigm shift of removing control into the hands of the user (us) will not be welcome by any current financial institutions. Thus we will have to wait and wait and wait for them to decide that there is profit, then we also have to wait while nations try and regulate the crypto markets to ensure they still maintain control (over both the institutions and taxes).
I like where governments like Sweden are going with declaring these currencies as quasi commodities. It gives us plenty of room to grow a market and add value to the coins whilst keeping everything at arms length from disrupting the established banking system. In time there will be changes and we may yet get to the ultimate vision, but for now I think the commodity style trading suits us well.
In a few years doubtless we'll have merchants (a la Silkroad) that only trade in cryptos. What we don't need right now is to repeat the Bitcoin/SR scenario. It is relatively easy for us to be slammed by conventional banks when illicit or unauthorised transactions form the platform for coin growth. If we can keep the growth within the realms of understanding to the layman (ie banker) then we will establish credibility even against the wishes of those we seek to remove from authority over our money.
For now, we should all just continue the excellent work of building the profile and value of what we want. Looking too far ahead is scary and a bit irrelevant given the ignorance of 99.99% of the global population. Looking short term at a regulated commodity based trading system is realistic and should be welcomed and encouraged. As the price of crypto goes up so does its attraction to new investors and entrepreneurs.

yes you're absolutely right that printing to keep M0 relatively level is how it all works. I still find it extraordinary that every single UK citizen apparently has that much average cash. Of course they don't, but think about the last time you had that, and for how long, and where it went. It can't always be used car sales can it?

to be fair, they were idiots before they did this

the average UK Bank of England currency holder has £1000 in cash in their actual possession (source needed)
There's not many that actually do, but the cash is out there somewhere

BTC is itself a protocol (with amazing unbreakable code to propagate and run the system). Other protocols came before and new ones will come about in due course. In all the blockchain crap floating about, there will be some advances, hence all the VC interest in startups. 
On a purely commerical/coding basis it remains to be seen who has the sharpest tools in the box to make the next leap or even just to build the most effective superstructures on the foundation of BTC.

2outoftheloop because no govt gives a
 fuck what the informed people actually think. Ymmv and i sincerely hopr it works for you,  but the fundamental is that govts across the globe are racing to even grasp the straws that they think they understand.  It is a very funny thing to watch a bunch of retarded bankers trying to break stride. It looks like the music business circa 2003, which was at least amusing.  This time it is genuinely lol funny

Fine, but he is only just teething. Let him grow into the experimental mature sibling his parents would like to see before accusing him of being a vampire.
