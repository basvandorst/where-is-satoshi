Bitcoin is like cash. It can move hands at any time. On exchanges, it just depends on the exchange, and exchanges have generally been open all the time. Couple weeks ago, people here have been saying there's a "weekend dip"; the price drops at the end of the week and promptly comes back up the next. This past weekend, that did not happen; instead, Wednesday happened. As for this weekend, who knows?

I'm really glad the most widely used source of live market data is a guy who isn't taking the whole thing too seriously.

I haven't bought anything with it yet, but I'm excited for bitcoin's potential.

Good point.

AFAIK on Coinbase, you can do two types of buys, depending on what's available at the moment:
(1) The buying cap has not been reached; thus, you buy bitcoin at the current exchange rate price. What you pay and what you get is locked in for when you receive this.
(2) The buying cap is already reached; thus, you give them USD and reserve your place in line for bitcoins to be bought in the future. However, you receive the exchange rate on the particular future time that they specify. This is something that they only recently added.
It sounds like what you got is the first scenario, although you expected the second. Did you check a checkbox about understanding you'll get the future rate when you placed the order? If you didn't, your exchange rate was supposed to have been locked in. Otherwise, there's a problem somewhere...

Awesome! Still I'd imagine, of all countries, China would want to keep tight control on their currency, so be careful!
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:05:12
Actually, far from it.

Cool analogy until I realized that... that would also be pretty sketchy.

"Secure" passwords are not enough when a lot of money is at stake. My tech-savvy friends and I had our Diablo III accounts stripped of items and gold last summer even though we'd thought ourselves as having strong passwords. Many others in the community suffered the same fate, although because Blizzard runs that show some could get their accounts rolled back. Unfortunately with bitcoins you won't be able to do that, so you have to take care of yourself.
You MUST use not only a strong but a unique password as well as two-factor authentication with that much money on there.

Pay it forward to bitcoin skeptics?

That is not funny. Just because he's a young East Asian entrepreneur does not mean he should be associated with Zhou Tong. In fact, he's much older than Zhou Tong and is of completely different heritage.

If it's that easy to impact the price of bitcoin, is a site-wide discount from SR equivalent in effect to the Fed changing interest rates?

Coinbase has some capital behind it and is probably going to be good. However, they only have two or three employees and have suddenly run into unexpectedly high demand in the past month.
When all's working well, Coinbase basically lets you conveniently link bank accounts to their pretty interface at the inconvenience of trading at a delayed rate. IMO that's completely fine if you're willing to take a gamble on the price over several days, or if you care more about long-term holding. But again, they're going through some growing pains at the moment.

You don't need a BoA account to do a Bitfloor deposit there.

I'm completely serious. No need for our optimism about bitcoin's potential to be scared away by this recurring event.

I agree! And I wonder if I could actually get tipped, because I've never been tipped before...
Also, I know there are several common places for people to spend their bitcoins, but where do YOU like to spend yours?
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:12:23
I also now always ask people who seem like scammers to give me money in BTC.
