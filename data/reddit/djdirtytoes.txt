Transfer your stuff over to GDAX and send from there so you don't pay any fees moving out of Coinbase. 
I wouldn't advise any online wallet at all. Hardware wallet is the way to go. Either a Trezor or Ledger nano.

It's not just about talking about price. There needs to be a daily discussion thread pinned up there all the time. Otherwise you get an endless amount of new threads created which don't need to be. I understand there are important announcements that need visibility and that's fine but the one that's been there forever has run its course. 
We have over 600k people here who like to talk about Bitcoin and crypto in general and keeping as much of it in one place seems to make more sense to me than scattered throughout a ton of threads.

If you have 1 S9 miner you will be lucky to produce 1 coin in a year, more like .6 to .8 max with difficulty going up.

You referring to placing an order on Coinbase?

No you can only have 2 pinned threads.

GDAX and Coinbase are the same company, transactions between them are free and not on the blockchain. You use your Coinbase login to get into GDAX. GDAX covers all outgoing transactions as well as a few other exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:17:12
Well my first guess would be the fee was set so low given the amount you sent that you'll probably be waiting for a few weeks until it is bounced back to your account.
Your wallet will sit at unverified or won't show anything at all until it starts getting confirmations. This is the reality we are living in right now where you either use an exchange that pays the fee for you to move your stuff or you leave it on the exchange cause you don't have enough to move or wanna pay a high fee to resolve it quickly.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:55:30
I couldn't say what happened for your situation but I would highly advise you to not have shit like that saved on an email. That's about as bad as having all your passwords stored on a notepad file on your desktop saved as passwords. Write stuff like that down if you have multiple passwords, don't let it touch the internet. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:39:56
I've never used them but it looks like they do cover the fee, sorry I should have checked that first. It's possible they batch their transactions so it could take several hours for it to show up. Someone on here has to use them so they would be much better suited to answer you than I am. 
I would definitely suggest in the future not to try fixing a possible problem by doing the same thing over and over. That generally doesn't lead to a good outcome. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:37:13
They seem to keep replacing it, it's frustrating. Personally I'd rather see it there all the time and that don't invest recklessly post removed. It has been up there long enough and people do whatever the hell they want.

I'm not sure what industry he is in that is off until tomorrow but the vast majority of the country went back to work today and a lot were working Monday but that's generally lower paying retail jobs.

I suppose that's possible. I can't deal with that site for more than a minute at a time or I feel like a stroke is creeping up on me. Way too busy. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:01:26
Hopefully something gets sorted out for you. I see a lot of complaints about them not paying out on sports book review and a few other sites. They seem to come up with half ass excuses and forget about you.

The XRP rally is currently over for now. It's down under 2 bucks again.
This is just a downward spiral for mostly everything right now.

3 weeks ago the price was damn near exactly what it is now. You might wanna research a little better. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:18:33
I spent too much time pondering doing just that, from like 75 cents on. Not the first time I've gotten inside my own head and doubted myself. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:37:15
I'm in no rush, I know they have a huge backlog. I patiently await my turn. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:19:30
I don't know nearly as much as I should but coinbase and gdax will credit you the correct amount of b2x as long as you have your coins on either one. 
The replay protection is to avoid duplication I believe. You'll obviously still have your bitcoin and then you'll also have the b2x.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:27:28
I don't disagree that we are ass backwards in the US but if you think crypto is gonna save the day when someone drops a nuke on us you better spend a lot of time revamping that plan.

Damn, this is second time in the past week the daily thread has gotten unpinned. How am I supposed to get my daily dose of people freaking out?!

ACH normally takes 7 to 8 days to show up on Coinbase. It will switch from pending to giving you the date of arrival. Holidays are gonna make things take longer than normal too. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:29:12
If any wallet is not generating a seed then you are 100% not in control of your coin. You might as well leave it on an exchange where you don't control anything either. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:48:24
I'm assuming you were answering my question. You only enter the cents amount of the withdrawals in case you were inputting the whole thing.
I had a lot of issues linking my checking account. I had to change the security questions to get it to finally accept it. I chalked that up to me just not remembering what the hell I made them years ago but it might help you. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:12:37
Took around 5 hours for mine to confirm today. Also happened to be my biggest transfer to date so I was slightly concerned for a bit there. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:14:08
Yes a case like this is one very good reason why the delay exists. They would have been out of business already otherwise with all the people trying to pull a fast one on them. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:44:15
That is correct.

You are completely wrong, you pay nothing when you transfer out of GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:44:34
You shouldn't have your crypto on any exchange period unless you plan to actively trade with it. Get it on a wallet or risk losing it if the exchange gets "hacked" by a greedy employee. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:05:03
Oh I hear ya. They had me on the edge of my seat for several hours yesterday. Even though I'm sure I do the transfers correctly there always seems to be that little voice of doubt in my head telling me I screwed up. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:58:33
Hey it's yours to do with as you please. Would you let me hold your cash or private keys? If you answered no, why the hell would let another stranger do it.

The fee would have been free had you used GDAX. You also can't buy Ripple on Coinbase so I dunno where you are going with that. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:13:20
Would be helpful if you explain what you did for them to suspend you. Just telling people to stay away when it was possibly your fault is of little help. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:11:01
If memory serves you have to transfer your current coins to a new private key in order to input your old and now empty one online to be credited the forked coins.

Merry Christmas folks! Let's make some money today!
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:55:33
Yes, GDAX and Coinbase are the same company. Coinbase should only be used to do ACH buys or buying with a credit card. Otherwise get your stuff over to GDAX and decide what you want to do from there but any withdrawals are free from GDAX. Gemini also does not charge a fee to move your stuff. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:26:41
Yes I believe that's a great way to build something with no inherent strength. Maybe they have it full of rebar and concrete, still seems wrong even if so.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:06:39
I plan on moving mine back to GDAX just for ease of dealing with it if that helps you any. The fee is what it is seeing as you'd likely have to pay it anyway to shuffle your coins from your wallet later to get the b2x after the fork if it isn't on the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:59:40
It is considered a regular purchase, not an advance.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:04:32
B2X will be the new coin. If you want to ensure you can get to your new coin right after the fork you need to have it in a wallet you control. If you have your stuff on an exchange you are at their mercy since you don't control your key. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:07:13
I like using Blockfolio on my phone. You enter your holdings manually and it'll keep you updated. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:22:23
If you consider a dude in his garage rocking out a few miners to be high end, sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:08:03
To be fair so does Gemini. Unless you are referring to wire transfer
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:41:19
That's because you aren't moving your stuff over to GDAX from Coinbase and then paying nothing to transfer. This is brought up many many times every day. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:19:49
If it follows yesterdays trend it'll be under 10k today sadly. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:39:38
Are you trying to use a credit card or your checking account?
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:27:40
It always seemed to me the nicehash calculator throws out high numbers that aren't realistic. Some of it is also gonna depend on if you have the 3gb or 6gb card as they use different memory. 
I would say if you have the 3gb card you'll be lucky to see $1.00 a day before the pool fees. You can always fire it up and give it a try, can't hurt.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:15:40
What are you planning on mining and have you ran it through the calculators? Don't take their output numbers as gospel either, you won't make as much as they say. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:39:02
Ouch, yes reversing an incoming deposit or doing a chargeback is a surefire way to get your account closed on any exchange. You are now at the mercy of their support which you probably already figured out is gonna be a long wait.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:11:17
Blockfolio would be perfect for what you are describing. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:35:01
I'd be willing to bet that transaction hit the blockchain.
As far as the nonsense of whoever told you they will cancel your account, that's hilarious. If you signed up for coinbase you already have a gdax account. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:00:15
You'll likely be waiting 3 to 6 hours, GDAX batches transfers together.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:36:17
The high fees are being caused by a tremendous amount of transactions taking place, some to intentionally cause such a thing to happen. 
I'm not the guy to help explain the security details but Bitcoin and this whole crypto coin world will long be turned to dust before anyone could break the encryption. At least for the time being.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:02:17
I understand. If I can ask, how did you do your ID for verification? Take a picture of the front and back and upload it?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:43:36
I submitted a support ticket. They say verification can be backed up to 2 weeks but it's been longer than that so we shall see. I'm looking forward to using them. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:08:36
With the insanity of new users I don't know how long it takes now but it should only take a few minutes to verify your bank account. They send 2 small withdrawals and you enter those numbers into coinbase to verify.
Once your account is linked your next problem is gonna be getting that money. Just so you know it takes several days for the deposit to get to your bank. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:59:13
Exactly. Is that too much work or something?
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:27:19
Ya moving stuff back and forth between your own account is one thing and it's nice. What he did surely had to hit the blockchain regardless of it staying with the same company. 
Coinbase/GDAX has done some messed up stuff without a doubt but 90% of the time its their users simply doing stuff wrong or not being knowledgeable enough to understand what the hell they are doing in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:43:47
Is that the gambling site you're talking about? If so I would say they pretty much just ripped your brother off and there is likely nothing you can do about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:46:44
Ya... You are adding completely unnecessary steps. There's a thing call fiat that that keeps its price stable as well.

No need to stoop to their level. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:26:50
That's kind of like asking what the winning lottery numbers will be at this point. Nobody knows, it's all a guess. 
Given the basically lateral movement for over 3 weeks now I gave up trying to guess the next move. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:44:24
You also broke rule number 1 of owning, never talk about how much you have. Congrats though.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:33:34
I hate to break it to ya but you won't be picking up any miner that can produce .3 bitcoin a month as they don't exist. A single s9 at best will give you .8 a year but probably a lot less. From there you can remove the mining pool fees and your electricity.
You also won't be getting an s9 for 2,000. Try more like 4,000 to 6,000. You'll be one of the luckiest people on earth if you can get one from Bitmain before they sell out every time for their true retail price. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:52:31
Only way they would have sent it to the wrong address if they were being honest is because you would have copied the wrong address and gave it to them. I'd be more suspicious of them just keeping peoples winnings but anything is possible I suppose. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:40:40
You paid the fee to the miners to move that coin. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a tiny sliver in there for coinbase along with it but it's mostly the miners. 
Try moving your BTC from a hardware wallet and you'll be pulling your hair out looking to blame someone else.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:45:38
You can change the name of the exchange to pretty much whichever one you so choose and your statement is still valid. They all suck at support. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:41:11
It's currently at 2.07 on Binance. It's far from a run given how it's down from yesterday. Everyone is taking a bit of a hit at the moment.

It bothers me that the block wall was not laid staggered. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:07:19
I couldn't answer that. I know GDAX said they will support the fork but that was also when it was supposed to happen in November. I intended on shifting my coins all back to GDAX before the 28th but I decided against it since their adoption could take a while if it happens at all. 
If any of the exchanges support it, it's gonna be on their own timeline. You may get access to it in a day or 6 months or never.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:55:38
So you overextended yourself and it's Coinbases fault you can't pay your rent?
As far as I'm aware you can't deposit money back to a debit card, you need a bank account linked to deposit money. One other thing, the stuff you bought, is it pending or is it actually in your portfolio? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:13:39

I can't speak to how Quadriga works as far as fees, I use GDAX and Gemini. The fees are what they are at this point in the game if your exchange charges you to send, thats up to you to decide. I think it makes things less painful if you have several thousand dollars in holdings as 30 bucks in the grand scheme of it all isn't a blip really. As far as wallets go a Ledger or Trezor are great hardware wallets. I would highly advise against using any sort of software wallet, too much potential for loss. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:07:48
Any amount is a good amount as long as you can afford to lose it. Don't buy into this with the expectation of massive returns because nothing is guaranteed.
Mining is definitely out of the question unless you wanna spend many thousands on hardware.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:38:04
I just checked through my account for ACH on buying and there is no different code stamped to it for buying Litecoin or Bitcoin so I don't think your bank knows the difference. All it sees is an ACH to Coinbase that I can tell.

Not trying at all, in fact I agree with his overall point. I just found it funny that he chose to do his math wrong while telling people to educate themselves.

As long as they are good clean pictures it should work right away. The app can be a nightmare to use for that from what I understand.
