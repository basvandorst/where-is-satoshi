Don't forget to include the transaction fees that most exchanges have as well

No one controls Bitcoin, that's what decentralized means. 
It's safe, the best part about block-chain is the inherent  security that comes with it. Hence the Crypto part of Crypto Currency.
I'm not sure what you mean by "Is it real?"
Feel free to check out if you have any questions!

Haha good catch, though in my defense I meant its impossible to predict when, not if it'll correct.
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:01:49
hey, would you look at that you were right.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:52:08
not entirely true because of ASIC miners. Plus there are other coins where mining with basic rigs is still profitable.

Took me a few lines to realize this is Die Antwoord
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:02:43
Most exchanges haven't if you look at [cryptowatch](
still who cares, it's meme time.
* GDAX
* CEX.IO
* OkCoin
* Gemini 
all had confirmed over 9000 as the ATH

didn't know that was a thing, I'm going to start linking this instead of trying to answer every ones questions. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:58:19
no worries mate!

It's all fairly simple once broken down. To buy bitcoin you need to use one of the exchanges that offers them for USD (or whatever currency you may use). I personally like [Coinbase]( because it's easy to use , but [Gemini]( and [GDAX]( are also good exchanges, and there are a few others.
Simply make an account, and click buy.
After they process your transaction, your BTC will be stored on a wallet on the exchange. It's generally a terrible idea to keep your money on an exchange though, so you'll want to take it off there whenever possible. To do this you'll need to make a wallet. There's a lot of information about this available, but [here was a pretty good write up about wallets]( recently in You can also check the Sidebar of for more information!

If you're hodling like a pro, the best time to buy is anytime. Plus we just hit $7,400 while I was writing this after sitting around $7,200 for hours.

I personally have been throwing as much money as I can afford to spend at Bitcoin (and other crypto currencies) for months. 
Block-chain technology (What Bitcoin runs on) is still in it's early years. In my opinion, and many others, it's like investing in the internet back in the 90's.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:45:56
it's a bot account spamming non-sense. Ignore it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:37:20
this has been said about BTC with every all time high. It will almost certainly keep going up, and a much faster rate then any stock or other investment.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:12:53
If someone could answer that, then they'd be rich. 
It's impossible to predict when a correction will happen, but it will soon. It could dip back to $8,000 soon, before rising again, or it may hit $10,000 then dip back to only $9,200. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:45:23
added to the list, man there's a lot of fake accounts.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:57:22
don't comment on the bots, it keeps there post here as [deleted] otherwise
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:01:21
I've heard a lot of great things about Gemini, unfortunately they don't support my bank.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:55:58
Yeah, Antminer S9 is one of the most popular SHA-256 ASIC miners right now. A new one is coming out soon as well.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:49:20
I wouldn't be surprised if upvote bots were involved, but account looks legit enough that I don't think it's a bot post per se.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:21:58
I think he dropped this ^/s
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:43:16
I'm seeing lots of accounts with the name crypto_____ posting the same exact comments on multiple threads. Ignore the FUD.
Edit: Too many to link all their names, I've reported at least 50 so far.

I honestly don't know, and they aren't necessarily saying anything negative about BTC either. It all seems to be positive, or very random and not related at all.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:06:23
I think it's time to stop spamming that.

huh, I didn't know that Litecoin profitability went down that much, thanks for the heads up. I'll update my post.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:34:02
Mining BTC is only profitable if you use something called an ASIC Miner, which is a specialized machine only for mining BTC. These cost at least a thousand dollars, and have to be bought in bulk usually.
Mining other crypto currencies, such as Ethereum or ~~Litecoin~~ ^1 are something that can be done with a normal gaming computer.
For the legality of it, it is definitely legal. China has had a lot of regulations put in place about crypto currencies within the past couple months, but I believe mining is still allowed there.
If you really are interested consider checking out for mining Ethereum, or for mining Bitcoin.
Edit: 1) Litecoin is no longer profitable without an ASIC apparently
Also it's worth noting that most miners will tell you that you'll make more money by just buying Bitcoin, instead of buying a miner for it. I'd only look into it if you're interested as a hobby, or mining other coins that don't require an ASIC if you already have a decent graphics card.

It's worth noting that this is a bot comment. It's in relation to another post about an interview, and has nothing to do with the DBZ meme.

I think we'll break $8,000 today.

[Assuming you mean the song, here.](
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:35:29
Just found out yesterday that my room mate didn't realize that. He said "I considered buying a Bitcoin when they were $1,000, but I couldn't afford one."
I stared at him in silence for 10 seconds to see if he was fucking with me.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:41:38
I understand the hesitation, but I feel like you'll be regretting it in a few years. I thought the same thing when I put a hundred dollars in initially when it was at $2,000.
If it's just BTC that frightens you check out other coins with a much lower market cap, like STRAT, NEO, OMG, or ETH to name a few.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:47:06
Glad to hear it.
I'll keep an eye out and flag anything that looks weird.
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:22:55
I don't believe you for a second, but man I love that song.
