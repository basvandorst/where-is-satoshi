These noobs need to stop complaining about this HOLIDAY SALE. Stock up during the dips and be grateful you fucks.

Very “smart” of you to do this and then decide to confess to it on the internet immediately after. You’re basically James Bond is what I’m saying.

You’re welcome! Regardless of the name you choose, you should definitely post a photo of the boat when it’s ready. Congrats on the boat and your success with BTC!

“Hodl on to your bits”

Almost all others are trading via bitcoin, what the fuck did you expect? This is because of bitcoin. Ride it out and stop panicking.

Well said.^

No shame in that. Thanks for the honesty. 
We should be allowed to sell bitcoin and talk about it on here without everyone accusing you of selling out or not HODLing. We don’t know your life or your situation. And we shouldn’t rub anything in the future in your face if bitcoin ends up growing. This is all uncharted territory and no one should shake their head at you for paying off your debts and being a responsible adult. 
All are welcome here in the community...even non-HODLers who participated in bitcoin and helped us all to get to this point.

I’m in Florida so I have no idea what that’s like! Can’t wait to see it when it’s out of storage. I didn’t buy into bitcoin until May of this year and I’ve never sold it. I plan to HODL for many years and then maybe I’ll get a boat of my own. I live on a river for goodness sake!

$7K is profit loss or actual loss

This is an excellent point to raise and gave me a lot to consider. Thanks for the insight!

I plan to HODL until 6 digits.

Place a limit order in GDAX to save on fees. Then transfer to your wallet. Don’t store your BTC on an exchange.

^^^Worst advice ever. HODL
