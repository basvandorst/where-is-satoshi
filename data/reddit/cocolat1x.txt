all basic economy books which talk inflation will tell you this.
Besides we need a bit of inflation, for example, if you have 100 dollar at 2% inflation you lose 2 dollar a year. However if i have 100 million dollars at 2% inflation i lose 2 million. So then i have to use my 100 million to either invest in a company, or in stocks (which end up invested in companies) which in turn ends up with creating jobs and providing other people with money to live. If i don't invest my money to make up what i lose by inflation then 100 million will turn to nothing in a few decades. Inflation makes you spend money and invest it back in the economy.
Thats the problem with bitcoin, if i expect it to grow a lot, sure as hell i will not buy anything using it because hoarding will just make me richer without having to take risks. Thats the problem that bitcoin faces and will never become a currency until it actually depreciates, right now it's just speculation = people who day trade, hodlers who want to get rich. 
Also the supply of money in the world has to take in account the fact that we keep increasing production so if we have more stuff it makes sense to have more money to account for that stuff.

dude, official inflation is usual greater than real inflation, just read a frikin economy book to understand what inflation is, why do we need it and why inflation hurts people that have a lot of money more than it actually hurts people with less money.
The rise in cigarette prices in Europe is due to heavy, heavy taxing because it is a vice.

LN is nothing but a half assed attempt to save this pyramid scheme of a shitcoin that bitcoin is. The smart ones got fat at 19k while only the sheep are HODLING now because they dont wanna accept the truth.

I know why it's there. The problem is that it's not good if we want bitcoin to succeed over fiat money as long as we have limited energy. Wasting resources is really bad so I think the community should try and find a better solution to security other than wasting. I know other coins are trying to achieve this.
