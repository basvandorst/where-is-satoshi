* Bitcoin needs a P2P or OTC exchange not a detrimental intermediary.
* mtGox can separate you from your money. Unacceptable for a bitcoiner. They are in the wrong direction.

MtGox is TOXIC to bitcoin. It is the most dangerous bitcoin business ever. Their failure will hurt bitcoin. Because today most of the trades are there. Tomorrow the chaos will hit their door... once it happens bitcoin will suffer because some people like to use unsafe, unprepared, old-fashioned systems like this toxic site.

History is full of examples of the same model failure.
Bitcoin history is still being written. Bells are ringing in your head to not accept the old model. It doesn't work anymore. The way to go is OTC or P2P trades.

Wrong. MtToxic is trying to solve a new problem with old tools. It wont work anymore. They are a 2008's business model. They are condemned. There is nothing that will save them from the coming failure. The man with the gun will kick in their door the same way that they did with all others business who tried the same solution. MtToxic is pure drug. It is toxic to bitcoin. Maybe your mother never told you to not use drugs. Maybe this is why you like MtToxic so much. MtToxic is pure cocaine.

if you can detect proxy,tor,vpn,etc. why do you still accept deposits? isn't it a planned scam game?
a real legit business ask for documents BEFORE not AFTER receive money. who make excuses AFTER receive money is called SCAMMER not trustworthy business.

those like you who believe in the gox model don't need to use bitcoin. continue to use all the others same model business that already exists outside of the bitcoin niche.

Don't lose your time with this scam. They are bitcoin enemy. Mtgox is a get rich quick scheme. Not for you but MagicalBux. He block accounts for profit.
**WARNING:** You have no protection once a disgusting employer, the owner, partners, hackers, sell your ID on black market. It is very dangerous for people like you to use this site. Others redditors will never tell you this, believe me.
You and your bitcoins are important. Mtgox isn't. Protect your bitcoins. Never use mtgox! 
TRUST NO ONE!

Sorry to say this. You are a solid developer. Why do you want to create a bot to a site that do not help bitcoin??? Bitcoins is all about P2P. Mtgox is in wrong direction. It is a detrimental intermediary. They are the man-in-the-midle attacker. MtToxic is a dangerous solution to the Bitcoin Network. Use your knowledge to develop a real P2P bitcoin exchange/bot solution. You will truly help bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-11-30 01:58:24
* You pretend to be legit placing information where no one read it.
* Deposit is always allowed and welcomed to make your scam game profitable.
* You have planned your scam to trap newbies bitcoiners and people from places like Saudi Arabia.
Good job. You are profiting and destructing bitcoin.
