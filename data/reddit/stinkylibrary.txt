Actually I was just reading an exchange where the lead dev said he didn't thing it was possible to add ERC20 tokens "easily" so he couldn't tackle at the moment and supposedly another dev who works with ETH/ERC20 said he was going to begin working on it and knew what was needed. 
So probably only a matter of time. It's open source so if anyone wants to contribute and help on that feature they're more than welcome to.

This statement really shows how little you know about crypto. 
There is no blockchain without a token that represents value... Value is what secures the chain...
Without an incentive how do you expect people to secure your blockchain? Out of the goodness of their heart?

I would agree with you except for the fact that he stored his explosives in a residential apartment complex and then shipped them through the mail endangering countless people. 
It shows that he is willing to hurt others just to make a few bucks.

And this is just the beginning of what is going to be an incredibly cutthroat environment - with this much money at stake you are going to see more manipulation, hacking attempts, slandering, FUD, and insider trading than ever before. 
We are already seeing much of this with Coinbase. Just look at the Bcash debacle and the R.I.P.ple rumors and you see how much money there is to be made. When you are so big and powerful that you can swing the market with a mere rumor of you supporting a coin then what is to stop you from exploiting that? 
Centralized exchanges are making an INSANE amount of money! Look at what Cryptopia just said - they are making $1 million per day running their exchange. 
Now the ecosystem is filled with coins controlled by "marketing teams" and "CEOs" there is going to be so many "deals" being made to the benefit of the few. 
This will cause a crash and regulation will then step in because it is really the wild wild west right now. Once regulation kicks in it's going to be all over for so many people. 
That's why the future is decentralized exchanges and atomic swap platforms like BarterDEX and others. When there is no influence and support is community based and coins are never delisted it becomes a living breathing being and not something to be controlled by one person.

San Jose, California Man Pleads Guilty to Selling Explosives on eBay
The United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California announced today that Roger Ver was sentenced to 10 months in prison for selling explosives on the online auction site, eBay. The sentence was handed down by U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Fogel following a guilty plea on one count of dealing in explosives without a license in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 842(a)(1); one count of illegally storing explosives in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 842(j); and one count of mailing injurious articles in violation Title 18, United States Code, Section 1716. Mr. Ver, 22, of San Jose, was charged in an information filed in federal district court on August 8, 2001. According to the plea agreement, Mr. Ver admitted to engaging in the business of selling explosives without a license from January 1999 through August 2000. According to the information and plea agreement, Mr. Ver sold explosive devices described as “Pest Control Report 2000” on the online auction site eBay. He purchased approximately 49 pounds of the devices from a supplier in South Carolina, and sold at least 14 pounds of the devices to bidders on eBay. While engaging in the business of selling explosive devices, Mr. Ver stored the explosives in a residential apartment building and mailed the devices via the United States Mail in a manner contrary to Postal Service regulations. Judge Fogel sentenced the Defendant to 10 months in federal prison, a fine of $2,000, as well as a three-year period of supervised release. The Defendant will begin serving the sentence on August 2, 2002. The prosecution was the result of an investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Scott Frewing is the Assistant U.S. Attorney who prosecuted the case with the assistance of Legal Assistant Lauri Gomez.

For years we've talked about "mass adoption" and "wall street money" but until the last few months it was all a pipe dream. 
Make no mistake, what's happening now isn't *normal* and there is no playbook. So for you to say that we are misinformed because we are holding out for $100k or even $1 million per coin is just asinine.

Unfortunately/fortunately, there is a lot of interest in bitcoin at the moment and you tried to compete with the big boys when they were moving huge sums of money. 
Since the cost of your fee isn't actually related to the "USD" price of your transaction if you are only moving a few hundred dollars you are essentially "bidding" against someone who may be moving a few *million* dollars... 
In his case the fee is dirt cheap, but in your case it's your entire stack. You could, in theory, "bid" up your fee to the point where it is actually the entire value of what you are sending (leaving you with a send of 1 sat) but *still* not have your transaction included because your fee was much less than the other "bidders".

It's a simple case of supply and demand. If you only have 20 seats on your bus then you can only let 20 people ride your bus at a time. 
Is the bus broken? 
Absolutely not! The bus was built by the world's best engineers and runs really well - it never has an accident or problem. It's just that the line at the bus stop is really long. 
But hey, if you wanna go ride around in a bus that your 13-year old sociopath of a cousin put together with spare parts because it has 160 seats - then by all means, enjoy your ride!

Yep, I bought 10 S1's when they dropped down to $275 a pop. I've already earned 1.7 BTC from them and with the difficulty only going up by ~10% ROI is going to be very soon.

No, there really shouldn't be an increase in block size right now because *at this point* it's not about making sure everyone can transact instantly and for pennies. At this point it is about holding tight until technology and drive space becomes so cheap and ubiquitous that moving and storing terabytes of data would be nothing. 
While we are holding tight the population *will* eventually level off and at that point our available technology will allow us to increase the block size and other parameters to limits that would allow us to handle the transactions of everyone in the world.   
But if we push the block size up now you are effectively pushing Bitcoin into the hands of a very small group of individuals who can afford the expensive hardware that is supposed to be the one thing that ensures Bitcoin's decentralized nature. Do you see how that doesn't make sense?

@_date: 2017-08-23 00:10:06
This is due to market depth. 
Bitcoin and BCH (to some extent) have deep markets that can absorb a large amount of mined coins. In short, people want to buy these coins so there is demand. 
With Peercoin and other smaller ALTS it may "appear" that they are  more profitable to mine but as soon as you start dumping those coins into a shallow market the price will plummet. 
For all we know Peercoin's "true" price is really half what it shows and is only propped up by several small buy orders on the various exchanges.

My title is the process distilled to its simplest form. While you are correct that they are not officially taken off the market they really are considered to be off market since they are made to represent the value of the "company". 
Now the big question is which "ICO" will be the first to "cash out" ALL their tokens.... and what will happen once those floodgates are open? 
Basing your "company's" value off a token that is also traded and manipulated daily and reliant on ALL the other "companies" makes no sense.... You could have the value of your "company" wiped out because  other big "companies" cashed out...
