Is there a way to edit the date/time of transactions, or do they need to be added in chronological order?

This is a really great application.  I'll post a review on iTunes tonight.  Thanks for putting this together.

But bitcoin still needs to be exchanged for stuff.  If huge holders decide to dump their share, they will lower the exchange rate of bitcoin for fiat/stuff?  Am I looking at bitcoin wrong? It just seems like a stock to me.  More mined coins similar to a company issuing more shares?

Bitcoin is also fairly illiquid isn't it?  Have to wait for a buyer on an exchange to accept your rate, and then exchanges take a hefty cut.

That's more or less what I was thinking.  Need to do more reading, myself.  Using anonymity as a selling point seems... like a bad idea? to encourage adoption/legitimacy.  I'm still trying to figure out how bitcoin can be used for anything in practice.  I understand it as a store of wealth, but a penny stock is a store of wealth to those that buy into the story as well.
Edit: thanks the reply

Bitcoin isn't anonymous, though, right? Every transaction is recorded to the block chain.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, because I'm new to this stuff.

Interesting point, even if it was meant to be a tongue in cheek joke.  The amount of people living cheque to cheque with no emergency fund is staggering.

I'm confused by the Visa/CC/bank interest.  Why would they care about bitcoin at all? If they were interested in block chain technology for something in their processing network, why wouldn't they just create their own "currency" and use that?  I can certainly see why they would be interested in a ledger tracking every possible payment and transaction in their network, traceable and historically preserved forever.  The marketing data is priceless.
