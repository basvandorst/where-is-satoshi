I would be happy if he were progressively taxed and the taxes used to make a more egalitarian society, you know, like how money works.

That's not a problem with taxes. That's a problem with your country. Sorry.

South Korea has approximately the same tax burden as the US, and we actually get universal healthcare and more progressive taxation out of it. Not to mention some of the fastest internet in the world, and some of the best public transportation infrastructure... so meh.

Your country is doing taxes wrong. Sorry you have to endure that.

I wanted to say that in my original post, but I thought it was a little harsh, but yes. It sounds like you grew up in an upper middle class family and just assume that you're normal :D It's okay, everyone does that! But it's important that you recognize the real American middle class so you can approach social situations with more grace and understanding of other people's financial hardships.

Where I'm from in the US, a "very middle class salary" is 30,000 a year... The people making 50,000 or higher were considered rich.
