Just to clarify he’s worth about $19M so it’s a drop in the bucket to him, plus he does understand the idea and appreciates the idea

Exactly, if it goes to $0 he won’t lose a single minute of sleep over it, so insignificant. But if it does become the safe asset of the world, I can help out my grandkids someday.

He’s the one who asks me questions about it everytime I see him which is only a couple times a year for a few days. Everytime I see him I’ll tell him something new I learned or something he would find interesting.

I have no clue what I’m going to inherit and I live everyday like it’s $0 because I don’t know. I just want my Grandpa to be informed and educated on current day technology. Learning new complex concepts can help older people’s brains and prevent deterioration. Plus he’s the one whose told me my entire life about how fiat currency is being printed too fast so I’m giving him an alternative investment to cash. Plus, why would I risk half of my net worth and only singular bitcoin when he can speculate with his own capital. Like I said, $10,000 is a drop in the bucket for him and he’s still smart and has enough wits to make his own investing decisions. You’re acting like he’s a little kid rather than a retired adult with an extremely comfortable living situation.

95% of his portfolio is low risk and he knows that I’m going to inherit someday but that’s not my intention at all
@_date: 2019-07-14 04:16:17
It’s okay as long as they’ve been retired for 45 years and very comfortable. Plus he has about $300,000 in gold saved so I just convinced him to take a little risk

Thank you! It was a huge accomplishment for me and it seems like my parents are just as difficult to inform. Like I said, I think choosing areas that they understand helps a lot instead of trying to explain the most intricate parts that would go right over their head

I have no idea and I live my life as if I’ll never see a dime
@_date: 2019-07-14 04:09:35
He’s using his TD Ameriprise account but I’ll follow up with him and make sure it’s safe
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:57:30
I do have my own bitcoin, I just wanted to inform him and let him make his own investing decisions like he’s done successfully his whole life
@_date: 2019-07-14 04:18:19
He’s also waiting for it to drop a little because he thinks it’s too high right now. I know it sounded like I’m taking advantage but he’s truly interested
@_date: 2019-07-14 04:11:02
Abuser in what way? He told me he’s buying one and holding and that’s the way he invests
@_date: 2019-07-14 04:19:56
One day I might see some of his cash but not for a long time, I’m just trying to help my family by diversifying
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:59:20
Can you just elaborate a little more? I’m genuinely interested if your point has any meaning
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:04:09
Don’t teach the older generations about new and exciting technology to allow them to make their own investing decisions and keep them informed? ��
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:04:26
Hahahaha I love my grandpa and he’s one of the most influential and helpful people that’s ever been in my life. At this rate, he’ll probably live to be 120 and I’m praying he does. 
I’m only 22 and think I’ve created some great opportunities for myself to be as successful as him one day but he’s a legend, so maybe not.
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:10:32
Wow this gave my entire body chills. That’s exactly how I feel and he’s one of my biggest role models. just the thought of losing him makes me a little sad but I know that’s the cycle of life and I enjoy every minute of it.
@_date: 2019-07-23 18:19:29
I posted about teaching my Grandpa about bitcoin and convincing him to buy one when it drops and everyone roasted me ��

But fitting to the branding media has given bitcoin!
