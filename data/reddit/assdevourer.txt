Actually, the largest newspaper in my country had this news on its front page. I'm sorry that this doesn't match your twisted troll reality, where everyone hates or ignores Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:31:33
About the same as your comment?
@_date: 2014-12-30 20:10:07
But this blog article says it's not arbitrary:


@_date: 2014-12-31 08:06:05


Sounds like a problem with you voluntarily giving all your data away, not a problem with Bitcoin.
It's like saying Tor is not anonymous, because after using it to hack a website you go to the police station and admit it was you.
@_date: 2014-12-31 21:54:46
Hehe, altcoins...
@_date: 2014-12-31 00:36:38
ITT: Altcoiners getting mad at Bitcoin, including OP who is a Viacoin shill.
@_date: 2014-12-31 20:03:27
Sure, what they can't have is Bitcoin's hashing power, which is what makes it secure. That's why altcoins are useless: They are just copy/pastes like you say, but without the hashing power.
Other thing they can't copy/paste: Bitcoin's adoption. Microsoft accepts Bitcoin, not HobboNickels, Bottlecaps, or Litecoin.
I neglected to tell you that earlier.
@_date: 2014-12-31 05:52:10
People scared of sidechains:
- altcoiners
- famous trolls like OP
People who want sidechains:
- bitcoiners, including the most respected members like Gregory Maxwell.

Cool story troll.

Yeah ok, keep telling yourself that and go buy some dogecoin then. LOL!
@_date: 2014-12-31 01:15:59
In other words: Just hodl.
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:33:43
The reason could be sudden jumps in price, which put Bitcoin in the news.

Does Gregory Maxwell also have "serious gaps in his knowledge"? I invite you to check what he thinks about Peercoin.


Bitcoin never depended on such "security measures" for recent blocks, because PoW works. Checkpoints should only be used as an anti-DOS measure for really old blocks, and not as a consensus mechanism.
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:20:28
Yeah Gox will add Litecoin too! LOL

I find it annoying when people say "three letter agency", as if only everyone except the agency could understand what you are talking about.
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:34:56
It's a self-regulating system. If the reward/fees go down in value, some miners will turn off their ASICs and that's it. It becomes profitable again because there is less competition.
Note that this has already happened multiple times, you don't need to wait for the year 2030 to see it in action. Check out the current hashing power: it went down because of the price. Suddenly it's profitable again. A self-regulating system working as intended.
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:48:54

LOL so true. Right now their logo seems more innovative than the differences in the code.
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:44:39


Bitcoin is money, and you can't just "make it", unlike in the current financial system where the elite can create all the money they want. If someone has lots of bitcoins, the only way for him to stay that way is never spending them, or spend and then refill by offering something of value, like work or whatever. Seems pretty fair to me, and the distribution will only improve over time.
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:47:04
Yeah ok. Go buy some more Litebitcoins then, lol...
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:03:31
You were proposing to build Bitcoin on top of Namecoin, so I don't know why you say this now. In any case there's no reason Namecoin can't be a sidechain of the most adopted, most tested, most known, with the most network effect, the most infrastructure, the most hashing power, and the most security, Bitcoin.
Anything else will be an obvious pump and dump attempt by altcoin bagholders:
No, I say it should be Shitcoin!

@_date: 2015-01-09 06:07:15
That's like saying "If Paypal isn't secure, take it down".
How stupid can you be? I'm obviously saying that it can't be both decentralized and secure at the same time. PoS is either centralized or not secure. That's why PoS coins are 100% centralized because they either use checkpoints, or modify their protocol all the time to prevent hackers from catching up. The minute development stops, it will get hacked.


I won't stop spreading Facts U Dislike, sorry.
@_date: 2015-01-09 06:57:10
What does it feel like to be below shitcoins like Paycoin and Stellar? lol...

You end up with more wealth.
"Amount worth in money" doesn't really mean anything. Amount worth in which money? USD? Gold? Bitcoin? In fact most of us here would say USD is not even money, so you didn't have any money before, and you have a certain amount now.

Do you seriously expect us to accept all the extraordinary claims every shitcoin makes? Feathercoin claiming their built-in market will take them to the moon, Litecoin claiming Scrypt solves centralization because it's ASIC-resistant, Dogecoin claiming inflation is better for the economy, Darkcoin claiming their coin is anonymous and not at all a copy/paste if CoinJoin, Ethereum claiming it can be everything because magic, Quarkcoin, X11 and many others claiming they found a perfect cocktail of hashing functions, and so on... The list is endless, really.


There is no formal proof for PoS's security. If there were, people like the guy who wrote the cited paper would accept it instantly. But you, like every other shitcoiner, will obviously say that "No, they won't accept it because they are too invested, or for political reasons!".

Which makes perfect sense, since trolls only post good comments when they need to pump their karma to be able to skip the 10 minutes limit for posting. Voting based only on what the comment says might work for a sub with mods, but there aren't any mods here.

I'm not imagining any particular attacks, I'm just responding to the dumb argument that Litecoiners love: "It's better to have a second coin with a different hashing algorithm just in case!". Whatever attack can hit Bitcoin, it will be able to hit Litecoin much easier.

No it's not true, it's just something redditors love to repeat. Whatever happens with that entanglement, it's not something you can use to send information. If you could transmit information faster than light, it would mean you could send it back in time.

I'm all ears. But anyway I don't see what's wrong in accepting a defeat. Do you prefer to stay in denial? By your logic we shouldn't abandon fiat, because that would be accepting a defeat. There must be a better solution, like convincing our overlords to start being nice.
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:23:01


Nope, you don't understand the problem.
Dogecoin became vulnerable because it's not the top coin for its hashing algorithm, so the hashing power to attack it already exists (it's being used in the Litecoin network). That's why it had to become merge-mined with Litecoin.
Bitcoin is the top coin for SHA-256. The hashing power to attack it doesn't exist outside of its own network.
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:50:36
I care about letting others know that they could suddenly lose access to their coins for no reason if they use blockchain.info.
@_date: 2015-01-11 04:35:59
So your goalpost is now that a big company accepts Bitcoin directly with no middlemen (even though you are fine with them using middlemen for fiat currencies)? I'll laugh at you soon enough.

I'll never know!

No, the problem is you are comparing apples (Bitcoin, top coin of SHA-256) to oranges (Dogecoin, subpar coin of Scrypt).


Oh god...
Do you realize *we* were the ones who warned dogetards about all this? And all they could reply was "FUD! FUD! Mods pls remove! Much wow!".
Even when coblee created a HUGE explanation about all this (a luxury you guys didn't deserve in my opinion) and posted it in your own sub with the most kind words possible, you guys were still in denial.

@_date: 2015-01-11 00:38:16
The ounces vs BTC comparison isn't very useful IMO.
@_date: 2015-01-11 06:01:45
Except it doesn't work that way. The more costly it becomes, the more big farms will benefit, because they can reduce the cost by having large scale mining operations and you can't. And there is no way for the network to know whether the hashing power comes from different persons, or from a single entity. That's why there is no incentive for hosting full nodes either. Proof of work is all we have. So you might as well choose a fast hashing algorithm from the SHA family (like Satoshi did) instead of a slow one, and send the hashing power to the moon.

@_date: 2015-01-04 23:36:31

Different redditors are different persons with their own opinions and intellects.
Personally, the minute I saw someone reporting there was a problem with Bitstamp, I thought it could be an explanation for the price drop. It might be Gox all over again, which is bound to continue happening because people are still as uneducated as they were back then. "Oh look, random website offers to hold my coins. And it has a cute design, so it must be safe."
