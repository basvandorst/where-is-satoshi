You like to see poor TA that's basically pandering? This chart has been posted every week for over a year.

You can check for Adobe accounts here:  and the LulzSec release here:  the other one was found just by googling your email address.
@_date: 2014-04-17 22:38:35
Fastest way would be to just google your username/email and see if it comes up on any lists, you can also check here:  and  they also have a bunch of others.

A ton of people used that password on adobe, and a lot of the hints are John is a _, Sean is a _, it's pretty funny

Any sufficiently large corporation that is willing to invest around $1 Billion dollars could control the bitcoin network, I don't think we want big banks getting involved yet.

Oh man, can we somehow actually make the video they showed the official video for, "What is Bitcoin?"

According to this site:  it's around $930 million.

I wonder what a billion dollar government asic would look like.

If you are the same don4of4 with a hackforums.net account, you appear in their leaked database with don404(at)gmail.com, you also appear in the leaked adobe database with don4of4(at)comcast.net with the password I believe is 'dog'. If you reused any passwords/had weak security questions, you could have been compromised that way. You also have accounts at other mining pools, make sure all your passwords are different.
While all of this might not be related to your issue, it still show how most hackers gain control of peoples accounts.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:23:51
With 40k bitcoin it would be closer to $0.01.

If your email is sady92 your information has been found in several leaked databases, it appears in the hackforums.net and Adobe breaches, as well as whatever this is from:  If you reused one of those passwords it may have been from that.

Oh wow, amount taken:
Bitcoin:  13,000 BTC
Litecoin:  300,000 LTC
Their best solution is, "plz give coins back."

Well if you are in a competing business, like a bank/paypal. Why bother competing, just crush the competition.

But hey, they recently submitted a complaint to an internet crimes website... "uh so  like 10-20 million dollars of cyrptos were stolen from me a while ago..."

I got one too, but I don't have a localbitcoins account.

Value ledger?  The block chain is a ledger, but bitcoin itself is considered a currency.

can you upload a smaller picture please?

But using any random character over 8 times at the front and end of a password will make it for all intents and purposes uncrackable, since both variables are unknown to the attacker.  Even if this practice becomes common place, an attacker would still have an unmanageable amount of entropy to deal with.  Why  would ",./!@ be easily crackable even though it contains a common password and keyboard patterns (hell, even assume the 8 characters correspond to a birthday but typed in special characters), there seems to be too much entropy for a Markov chain attack even though it is a simple pattern.  Basically I'm kind of confused on how well a Markov chain attack can scale.

He doesn't even predict the end of Bitcoin.  He predicts, "...a wide variety of virtual currencies will pop up over the next several years. "  Or am I missing something?

cool fake account bro.

Fear mongering and exaggeration.
Could easily be: US to crack down on commodities like Gold and Silver, citing "tax fraud."

Not feasible, but people can, and are, cracking weak brainwallets.

Anyone know what will happen to a capitalone360 transfer I had going to bitfloor.  Has 50 bucks of mine just disappeared?

I asked my friend getting his MBA and he hadn't even heard of them before.  The main "problem" with bitcoin is that it is both a currency and commodity, not to mention its extreme volatility.

She should do an article on living off gold for a week.  I assume most transactions would be similar to the Louis C.K. sack of coins bit.

Not checking exact math, but yea, the sun would burn out before you used all of its energy to crack a key.  And if a 0-day weakness is found in sha-256 bitcoin security will be the least of our problems.

Hard drive space is not an issue, 1TB drives are common place now, and drives will only get larger for cheaper (sans flooding disasters).  What is an issue though is bandwidth, and that problem isn't as easily correctable.

I also ran a scan with accunetix, it found nothing really.  I assume the login page can be exploited using xss/sql injection/non sanitized inputs?

Have you tried other miners, or done a gpu full load test?  Sounds like the driver is crashing.  Try having gpu-z running before/during the slowdown to monitor the clocks.
@_date: 2013-05-28 08:24:45
...so everyone should put 15 periods before their "real" password.

Hmmm... I still have a pending deposit I made the day bitfloor got shut down...

Any word on what happened to pending deposits?
