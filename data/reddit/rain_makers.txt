It could be that Gox is cashing out for themselves as they don't have enough funds to pay everyone!

I would advise against it, although it is very tempting by looking at the prices. I would stay clear as GOXBTC's could end up being worthless if the Company is insolvent. If this is the case all assets will be stripped which includes bitcoins on your your Gox wallet. Hence the prices look so attractive, and only hope, rumours and speculation are keeping the price from falling down to virtually zero!

Although this is bad for Gox it is good for Bitcoin. I just hope that people who have funds tied up in Gox are able to cash out soon to use on other exchanges!

Very interesting and confusing at the same time. Good post :)

Perhaps these are transactions to bitcoin addresses that are not owned by anyone and therefore cannot be decoded by Blockchain

It's a great start for public acceptance and mainstream usability!

Good spot, and yes very cool indeed :)

It may be a while yet before withdrawals in Gox return to normal again!

It could well be, but still a bit of a mystery..!

It's easy to remember... news sell, rumours smell..!

This is a very informative update and very well constructed post with some useful links. Unfortunately it is just wishful thinking, and bares very little on the overall progress MtGox has in resolving the defective transaction malleability issues. MtGox has known about this problem since 2011 and has done nothing about it until it's too late. Anyone with any common sense can see that Gox's future is bleak and they are on deaths door. They are just giving everyone the run around. They have taken too many big hits by bailing out bitomat.pl, had $5 million seized by the feds with insufficient funds as bankruptcy look ominous! Trying to be positive is one thing, but clutching on straws and believing rumors and following false trails is insane! Good luck peps, but the writing is on the wall, so don't let hope interfere with better judgement.

Gox is in a mess and only has it's fault to blame. They should have solve this problem years ago went it was first identified! It is complete incompetence of Mark Karpeles and his team.

I think there will be a big shake up in the Bitcoin world this year… mainly for the good :)
