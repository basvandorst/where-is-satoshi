Ledger nano x is a great option IMO. I don’t use my personal laptop much anymore, so it’s nice to be able to transfer from CB/Cash App to the wallet via Bluetooth on my phone.
If you plan on making a bunch of transfers from CB/Cash App to a hardware wallet, I’d look for the product that makes that process as painless as possible. Ledger nano x fits that bill

First off, I was saying for temporary/hedging purposes. So yes, I think they’d rather take money off the table via USDT than USD, if they’re going to redeploy it soon. 
Second, I personally don’t trust my bank to not flag my account if there’s a &gt;$10,000 deposit. The less scrutiny on my account the better, IMO.
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:17:16
That’s what I’m saying. People will be scared and won’t do it.
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:36:05
My actual thoughts: the market price shouldn’t be any higher or lower at the moment than it already is. Stop trying to fit narratives on top of day to day movements. 
The “manipulated price” meme is either a) FUD, in which case buy bitcoin, or b) true, in which case who the hell knows what a correct price is or how long it’ll take to get there. 
My advice: HODL and stop overthinking this.

Except you’re more likely to require capital gains tax when using cash on the exchange. Less likely when trading BTC/USDT
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:00:45
Ledger Nano X is sweet. Bluetooth is so much more convenient than plugging in a USB
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:37:37
Should have DCA'd since you invested at ATH. Would be up money by now.
@_date: 2019-07-15 22:44:16
As the saying goes:
“The best time to buy bitcoin was 5 years ago, second best time to buy is now.”

He’s insane if he thinks I’m going to read that post
@_date: 2019-07-25 05:11:46
Not sure that’s true. Maybe for a subset of anarchists/thrill seekers, but your average person doesn’t want to break laws. Would be a huge roadblock to mass adoption
@_date: 2019-07-25 05:00:57
Smoke more weed, Turtle.
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:57:57
Buy more

The granddaddy of them all
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:31:30
Maybe you shouldn’t be as high as you are.
@_date: 2019-11-18 04:03:23
Any thoughts on get back into bitcoin, purely from an investing standpoint?
@_date: 2019-11-05 01:43:43
@_date: 2019-11-06 14:33:42
Do we know for how long they keep/share this data?
@_date: 2019-11-05 01:26:41
Yes you can. Cash app may give you a better price, though.
@_date: 2019-11-30 16:58:04
Can you please ELI5? Why are keys for spending, and seeds for owning?
@_date: 2019-08-01 22:12:49
Yes, in my opinion. The Bluetooth connection and Ledger Live phone app makes transfers to cold storage pretty convenient.
@_date: 2019-08-02 04:47:35
This was a shitpost. Not hoping stock market crashes.
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:45:09
Your money would still be in the wallet though. Just use the recovery seed on a new hardware wallet and you have access again. 
Using your logic, you lose access to your checking account if you destroy your physical checks.
@_date: 2019-08-02 04:36:40
Or could be a stock photo, who knows.
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:52:50
I like them, Ledger Nano X in particular. What’re your concerns?
@_date: 2019-08-02 04:58:33
I’ve personally got skin in the stock market game. 
Otherwise, a complete stock market collapse would be financial ruin for many people I consider close friends/family.
@_date: 2019-08-02 05:38:18
Harsh. Empathy’s not the worst quality, you know.
@_date: 2019-08-06 01:49:52
Thank you, stranger! How do I collect these sats?
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:07:30
Cash app
@_date: 2019-08-02 04:53:27
First off, your stocks only just recouped losses from 4Q. Bitcoin’s up huge over same timeframe, if you want to play the random end-bias game. 
The happening is going to be examples of this happening over a sustained period of time.
@_date: 2019-08-07 04:24:36
What’re we looking at here?
@_date: 2019-08-02 04:34:54
Could be a strong woman
@_date: 2019-08-02 05:17:14
Maybe, but some people are way over-allocated to equities, despite their age. Financial services firms have done a number on a bunch of older retail customers
@_date: 2019-10-09 03:55:50
Personally a lot clicked for me when I restored my first wallet. Planning on walking them through that (if nothing else to customize their PINs).

Today is Wednesday, sir.

Came here to say the same. No one can predict crypto prices accurately, but at least he gets in front of people to educate about the space.
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:15:17
My mistake, Jacobim
@_date: 2019-10-17 03:21:49
Idk, he’s a relatively interesting dude. VC investor in Twitter and Spotify IIRC. 
Feel like public figures promoting bitcoin would be a positive. Wondering why he stopped talking about it.
@_date: 2019-08-25 03:02:27
6.15 bitcoins should be every hodler’s goal
@_date: 2019-10-10 16:23:47
If we waited for every new user to understand the importance of being their own bank, this thing would still be a cypherpunk daydream. You don’t need to drink the libertarian anti-bank kool-aid in order to keep a hard wallet in a safe place, just patience. 
The gift isn’t about what’s good for bitcoin, but rather what’s good for my family. Whether or not they know it yet, they need exposure to bitcoin, and I might as well get them exposed now while prices are low.
@_date: 2019-10-17 04:21:43
Agreed. If he was only talking about it to promote bitcoin-related companies, that’d be much less cool than if he fell down the rabbit hole with the rest of us.
@_date: 2019-10-17 04:54:20
Nah it’s actually a google app on the Bloomberg terminal. You can see they posted the date at the top of the image. 
Think it was just a poorly chosen stock photo
@_date: 2019-08-07 04:28:31
BTC relics are metal
@_date: 2019-10-09 03:48:45
Thanks for sharing! Planning on keeping a copy of their keys, I’m going to assume they end up misplacing the backups I give them. 
Good idea re: backup contact. Will tell them which friends of mine they can trust to help recover wallets (including my own, if anything happened to me).
@_date: 2019-10-09 03:33:53

Well this sure didn’t age well
