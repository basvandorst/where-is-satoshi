Nobody is buying at $200/BTC in order to use it.

Yeah, I just don't see how Bitcoin can "work" if the price doesn't stabilize.  If it keeps increasing 10% per day, nobody will want to use it for currency.  If it doesn't stabilize and get used as a currency, the price will eventually crash.  And once there is a crash, would there ever be enough people having faith in the product for it to survive?
I would think that this rapid appreciation is about the worst thing that could have happened to Bitcoin in the long run.  In the short run, some people might be able to make some nice profits, though.

I think the problem was I tried entering .1 BTC instead of 0.1 BTC.

Seems like a good time for him to hedge.  Sell off $30k of his portfolio, and let the rest ride.

Yeah, I understand that a bitcoin is infinitely divisible.  But in your example, where would I go to buy $20 worth of bitcoins?

Oops.  I'm wrong.  Don't hedge.  Just keep the initial investment in bitcoins.

I looked on mtgox and I think another site and they had a 1 BTC minimum.  What trading sites will do less than 1 BTC?

Luckily we got a democrat in the White House to rescind all the insane things that Bush did.

Maybe I'm mistaken, but I don't think that the point of Bitcoin is to have some sort of infinitely appreciating currency that enables people to buy twice as much next week as they could have bought this week.
