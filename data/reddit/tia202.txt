Wow! Bitcoin hits $20k. Could it be the future currency? 
*Cue Spongebob 1 hour later scene*
BTC HITS 1M AS POTUS GIVES ENDORSEMENT
In all reality, I think the only way he endorses it is if he knows 100% that he and his family don't own any BTC, otherwise libs will be saying he said that to boost the price and profit.

Do yourself a favor and set an alert when the price hits X you will cash out, and completely ignore the price until you get the alert! :)

Let it catch up. Might take a few hours/days. Don't update or touch shit until it's done, I think then you should be able to access your wallet.

If you have $500k btc to withdraw from a house, you have $5k to spend on an accountant and someone to do your taxes professionally for you.
Step 1: Withdraw enough to pay an accountant. Use  to find and speak to an accountant and start preparing a tax plan. They will advise how much to set aside to pay your taxes. 
Step 2: Withdraw. Depending on your exchange (Coinbase 10k/week, Kaken top tier 500k/mo)
Step 3: Shop for your house, buy it like any normal process with remaining funds (total withdrawn - accountant + tax filing fees - closing/processing fees)= price of the house you can afford.
Step 4: Have the accountant refer to someone who does taxes for this or do your taxes for you if they are versatile and good enough. 
Step 5: enjoy!

This, write down your seed (DO NOT PRINT, PRINTERS STORE INFO), put it in a fireproof safe, and forget about it until 2020. Open the safe and enjoy! blockchain.info will let you make a wallet, give you a seed, then you can remove the wallet from blockchain.info. I don't recommend downloading any programs- I've seen reports of scam programs that send the btc to other addresses after you fill it.
