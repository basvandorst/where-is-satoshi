This isn't an issue for you.  
If you watch your deposit address on the blockchain you'll see Coinbase routinely sweep your funds into a pool account.  
You'll also find when you send funds they don't come from your address and often not even the pool address your funds went to.  
Other than Coinbase and your employeer no one can sit and watch your paychecks.  
This issue stems from refusing the same address to send and receive payments, allowing people yo watch your funds very easily, with Coinbase already using pool funds this prevents this practice immediately since you will likely never pay anyone from your deposit address. In fact I think Coinbase is set up to avoid this; i would have to look back over my thousands of Coinbase sends to see if one repeated, but just looking at the last dozen they haven't.   
Edit: 
Moreover you can keep your paychecks separate from other deposits just by creating another "account" under your Coinbase login, this way your employeer can only see their own funds deposited.

No one is saying its a good thing,  we're (I'm) saying "Coinbase advertises itself as a bitcoin bank, operating well inside US Financial regulation; so shut the fuck up".

Student loan companies offer several payment options without fees: automatic debit (ACH), mailing a payment,  are common. Additionally your bank normally offers a payment system: online bill pay.  
You decided to pay this fee either out of laziness requiring your payment to register by a due date or you just want a convenient easy way. 
Regardless, I'll guarantee nelnet has a fee-free way to pay.

Never use a third party storage if you don't have the pvtKeys.  This is a perfect example of an honest person being locked out of their funds by another party - one of the many things bitcoin prevents.

If you want to accept payment in BTC, keep it that way, and understand basic security Mycelium Gear is the clear winner;     
However, if you want to take BTC but really want USD then Bitpay or Coinbase are the options.  If your business is on the up-and-up I recommend Coinbase; they are here in the US, and really offer a solid service regardless of some of the negativity. If you business is involved in activities that are legal yet morally subject to debate (firearms, porn, etc) then Coinbase will drop you eventually. (just check both out and see which fits your needs the best)
Personally I like Mycelium for the collection of BTC (that way it comes directly to me, no middle men), and I send BTC to Coinbase/Circle/LBC/Mycelium Trader to "cash out" as needed.
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:00:51


Attempting to circumvent these laws is illegal as well, check out structuring (simple version is desinging or engaging in monetary practices which by nature attempt to disguise transactions or avoid regulations) .  These rules rest a lot of their power on phrases like "suspected, knew or should-have-known" combining that with explicit rules governing structuring are intended yo make it impossible to avoid penalty. 
In this case the government decides when you engaged in regulated trade, not you. 
It doesn't matter how clever you think you "structured" the trade, if you get flagged by a compliant institution (your bank, coinbase, etc) you will be charged.

Please see my fairly detailed response. 


By that logic so is PayPal, but you're not blaming them; even though their service is ultimately what this scam relied on. 


Large quantities of stupid people is not surprising nor unexpected. 


We're aware, you have yet to adequately explain this nor have you explained why the hell you accepted paypal in the first place. 


First thing that localbitcoin do is he can verify ids and phone verification plus verification of local bank bills and bank statements home utility bills ,, paypal history and account checks .. then localbitcoin should do a test transaction with the person which atleast stay for 60 days then they should tag with approved status and go public ..then alert the buyer during trade that the paypal account is passed verification and only that account and name should be good on incoming payments .   
You're aware people use localbitcoins to avoid this kind on invasion of their privacy?  Seems like you'd be better served by a regulated exchange. Actually if you want id verification why the fuck dud you use an anonymous service in the first place? 


So you're aware of paypals 180 theft-enabled policy then, why did you use it? 




Exactly, ultimately no matter what you think lbc should be doing, what paypals TOS are, what the dbag thief did; what really matters here (and what you seem to be desperately try to avoid) is personal responsibility. 
You are responsible for your choices. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:13:54
Coinbase has always been pretty upfront of being bank-like. They go out of their way regarding compliance, even to the point of aggravating users. 
You can hardly blame them for wanting to appease/avoid regulations tearing them apart.  
The same advice has been issued since Coinbase started: Buy and Move to your direct control.   
Coinbase is only for exchanging USD to BTC, if you are tech savvy enough for btc you don't need Coinbase to manage them for you.

First, holy shit people still use paypal; Second, I don't need to read anymore to know what happened. 






No shit,  thats why none accepts PayPal for bitcoins. PayPal is an ultra-reversible payment while btc is entirely un-reversible. 


Sounds like solid action, remove scammer when found. 


What should they do? Pay you out of there pocket for your mistske? 


Yup,  according to their TOS you are on your own. Again,  this why PayPal has been a no-go forever. 


Sorry you feel that way, but ultimately you decided to use localbitcoins to locate buyers, then accepted the highest risk payment possible. Not sure why you're not taking the blame for this one. 


Other users: fake trades if he's a scammer, not hard really. Thats why lbc is intended for face to face cash deals.  lbc even has warnings for non cash payments, you must have missed those. 


Nope, you got PayPal scammed,  just search "bitcoin PayPal" in any search field on any website and you'll see "don't fucking do it" as the response. 




Nope, they are simply an intermediary service. You are at minimum (I say 100%) 50% responsible due to the obviously shit choices you made, the scammer gets the other 50% for being a thief.

Why are you here? 
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:00:33
Correct,  
Set up accounts on several shady non question asking exchanges that deal in alt coins. Make sure none of these accounts use the same emails, preferably are in different countries, etc.   
Now you can run your btc through a maze of alt coins.   
Next set up a bunch of accounts on sites that pool funds, Coinbase, Localbitcoins, most gambling sites.   
Move your btc and alts through these accounts.  Make sure none of these accounts use the same emails, preferably are in different countries, etc.  
Now sit down and make a large list of random amounts, and start sending and mixing. Depending on the amount of btc, this may take weeks. 
All of these assumes that your computer/s is secure and you're not leaving an obvious digital trail, VPNs, TOR, etc.   
Best you can do is make it horribly time consuming to follow your coins.  
If you just want to hide them from non-NSA level surveillance just a few skips and splits will work. For Master Surveillance you'll definitely want to procure all btc/alts with cash and not your bank account, and understand that you'll just obscure the location of your btc.

That's where I'm confused, Coinbase notifies you of each purchase, I didn't assume you checked your account less then twice a month. 
 &gt; I had 2 fa enabled but had it remember my computer 
So you didn't have 2FA enabled. 
Assuming you're not a scammer, and haven't used another computer; then your computer is most definitely compromised. The person got access to your Coinbase and Cryptsy accounts and stole everything they could.   
It will be some effort but you should be able to prove to your bank you didn't make of authorize the charges. Expect Coinbase to close your account.

That's the exact opposite of what this does.   
180 days to dispute a crap sale, as opposed to bitcoins instantly irreversible for buyers.       
PayPal now covers digital items (possibly bitcoin?) buyers and sells can now engage in a lot more business with PayPal (that service everyone has heard of that integrates with practically all bank accounts, unlike bitcoin) this is great for both buyers and sellers.    
Other than sellers now having to provide a quality product that can withstand 180 days of scrutiny what's the problem? The 180 days thing isn't an issue considering you have always been able to *chargeback* for that length.

First I compromise your email. Since you're using the same email for banking as you are everything else I'll assume you're equally lazy about passwords.   
Next I goto Coinbase and ask to rest 2FA. They send a request where? Oh yeah your email, which I promptly use to take over your account. 
Now I change your settings in Coinbase to what I want, and buy away.     
This is why 2FA resets should put a 24 hold on Coinbase. I think you should have a phone number in Coinbase and the 2fa request should also have to be confirmed via txt.   
These two changes would make it impossible for this crap to happen.

Coinbase has always required some level of verification in order to comply with US Law.    
They recently made changes (which they publicly announced ahead of time) that they were restructuring the limits to reflect USD and not BTC.    
You'll notice a daily limit of $3k for non verified accounts, and a swing over to the FinCEN website it will explain to you why that number was chosen.  
Basically this is an issue for people who pay very little attention to the companies they doing business with.

Here is a question:           
I have been selling a lot of Bitcoin as the price falls.  
I had 1btc at $900, which I sold for $650. Does that mean I can claim a loss of $250?  
At that time the market price of btc was $600, so went and bought another 1btc.    
I'm my mind I had a $50 profit, because I still had my 1btc,  but can I also claim the $250(or $200) loss on my taxes?    
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:17:35

This is asked frequently, and as says there is something like more possible addresses than atoms in the universe.    
Here is a inforgraphic from a while ago that sums it up       
The [Bitcoin wiki](  has answers to a lot of these questions:    
**Generating tons of addresses**       
Generating an address doesn't touch the network at all. You'd only be wasting your CPU resources and disk space.
Also, a collision is highly unlikely.
Keys are 256 bit in length and are hashed in a 160 bit address.(2^160th power) Divide it by the world population and you have about 215,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 addresses per capita
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:02:49
$148?      
$148!!   Are you out of your mind, why would you think they could float you that kind of capital?        
But seriously, their automated high risk system is a bit touchy and unpredictable.  Have you contacted Coinbase, they have been known to honor these in the past?

Just because the only thing you know about pitbulls is from sensationalist media headlines and bullshit websites doesn't make it fact.    
The [ASCPA](  [Discovery News](
 and many others disagree, what they find is that most of these attacks stem from pitts trained to fight.  These dogs are supposed to placed for rehabilitation and not breed, but it does happen and people can unknowingly adopt or buy a puppy from a dog breeders that doesn't know or care.   
In addition [actual science](  shows us that small dogs are by far more likely to be naturally agressive, with Dachshunds being highly aggressive and violent even when compared to Rots and Pitts.   
But "Child nipped by small dog, barely notices" isn't nearly as captivating as your arm severing blood-bath.

@_date: 2014-01-24 05:39:32
Yes, but you're assuming coinbase is negligent.     
ACH transfer takes 4 days, so you buy 1 a day, for 4 days, and on the fifth your first ACH bounces.    
They charge your card, let's assume it goes through, they flag your account.    
You buy 1 instant on the 5th day.       
On the 6th, your second  ACH bounces, at that point I assume they woukd suspend your account.      
As the rest bounce, they start billing your credit card; which fails after the second.       
You now have a 3btc (~$2400) debt.     
They have your name, address, bank information, credit card info, ssn.   It wont be hard to sue you.    
Meanwhile, they continue to attempt charges against both you bank account and credit card, racking up fees for you; you can close the account, assuming it's not overdraft.    
But now you're on checksys, and that blows (hello tmobile Mobile Money, I guess) 
Basically, it's not fool proof, but they try.

2 things,     
I thought mining had to report as *income*, equal to the USD value the day the btc is mined. This would fall under income tax not capital gains.    
For btc usage when calculating capital gains a *First In First Out* is the method used, not a running average, and not a "pick what's best for you".  
Otherwise yes, this is a minor problem, that software will fix quickly. And now gives Big Money a foundation to work with.

Well, it's never black/white         
Some of the deals are group buys, some were time restricted in an effort to get the industry changed to a new standard. Some may have been bad deals, that ended up costing way more than the machines. 
I'm sure some Drive Ins can't afford the higher rentals, there are service contracts and all sorts of things.     
It would have to be looked at case by case.          
It's not just Drive Ins that had a hard time adjusting but multiplexes as well.     
Look at the 14-20 screen theatres, that's a couple million up front, national brands with thousands of screens were looking at a quarter billion.     
This was an expensive and difficult conversion, and there will be casualties.   But some of those casualties are from poor operation desisions. 
I have no issue trying to save honest businesses that simply can't afford, but I'd want to know if a Drive In receiving funds had the option to enter into one of the good arrangements and didn't, and is now stuck.    
Film prints have become harder two secure but they are still being produced, and again even multiplexes that didn't convert are having trouble securing prints.      
But this conversion started years ago, arrangements should have been made.

And in all or that you've missed the point of my idea.     
There is no KYC/AML safeguard with bitcoin, and that's going to be a major factor for Apple being hesitant to allow it.  I'm not talking about in-app purchases, Boo Fucking Who, stop using an apple if you don't like the way they offer services.   
I was discussing a potential reason they won't let allow apps that let the everyday person engage in money laundering, potentially unintentionally. 
Every other service you mention, Paypal, Banks, have AML protection to you and Apple.  You mention Coinbase being banned, and of course they did. Their app allowed you to circumvent any protection.

It's sold for us dollars, but it competes in the market against the other bitcoin in the market.  
Not all the btc mined is currently for sale, thus when calculating what percent of the market these btc represent we should only count the btc currently for sale on all the exchanges.

Everything you just said is exactly what a snake-oil salesman would say. Where as someone selling a product that actually has an affect would stand by that affect.  
You are saying that your sugar pills (videos) work because of some psychosomatic or somatic symptom disorder effect and rely on people telling you its working as proof it's working.   
As I suspected, after reviewing your link, we see that this study did not prove more expensive pills work better, but that people reported more expensive pills work better. What they didn't actually test was how much opioid was produced by each individual nor how much "pain" sensation their body relayed to the brain. 
All they tested was that people remain susceptible to the power of suggestion.

As a consumer I'm not concerned TD has found a way to save money, and if a significant portion of sales start coming from Bitcoin, you may see a discount appear. 
Not everyone has a credit card that gives money back, most of those cards and banks have fees.  Since your making the claim that those cards are realistically profitable please show me the work on how much I'd have to spend for that 1% to pay off all of the fees have incure for that "cash back".

The point here is that bitcoin doesn't solve the credit card problem because you've simply removed credit cards.

Because the blockchain it public, it's possible to track transactions. It's also technically possible for miners to refuse to include tx from a particular address.      
There are many ways to conceal or swap coins, making this difficult at best.    
Lastly, an advantage of bitcoin is that they are all the same to the network. It's partly designed to prevent a central authority (or a decentralized authority) from deeming your funds unspendable (?) or "tainted"

People hoped it would get classified as a private currency and treated as such (all standard sales, income tax).

@_date: 2014-01-16 05:28:34
That's normally how I do it.     
Instead of agreeing on a price before meeting, I agree on a price point like "coinbase + 5%".     
This didn't use to be a big deal when a 5% price change was $2, but now that its $42 it makes a difference. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 05:12:29
Request trade      
Speak with seller to verify terms, time, place  (public of course)        
If anything seems "off" about the other person, just move on.        
Expect the price to change if there is significant change in price.      
(this is the only real fair way to do it)      
If you are buying, expect to pay first.      
The seller should pre-fund the trade, which you can see if it's done.     
Once you have paid the release of the btc should be instant.      
I've had buyers bring the code, to confirm the tx but i woukd take a mobile device that can access your LBC account.  never rely on the confirmation code, you want to see btc in my account.     
Just be smart and safe, I've never had any problems, but I have canceled trades from buyers who said or did something to cause me concern.

Are you in US:   
coinbase to buy $800btc costs you  ~$808.15.    
You send it, and need 0.0001btc for fees which is about 0.08USD.    
So roughly $808.25
The hard part it when you converts back into cash.  If they can be sold on localbitcoins*, you can probably sell it for $810, and effectively have  0 fees. 
Otherwise you'd have to look at options available there.

@_date: 2014-05-10 12:07:14
Yup. The problem isn't that bitcoin is "unregulated" as so many people here claim. The problem is there is no standardization for the regulation, so each government agency can regulate it how they see fit.     
People like to toss around "property" from the IRS, but they are treating it like stock and bonds. This wasn't to make it difficult, it was to get their share of the  $50 to $1200 boom. It also gives a starting point for regulating exchanges and brokers, like the SEC does with the Series 7 exams, and compliance officers.    
While would suck for the ease of trade, but would fully legitimize bitcoin. 
FinCENs regulations make sense from the point of view of their responsibility: Stop money laundering. Bitcoin in obviously a currency and one that can transfer large volumes of wealth very easily and quickly. So that's how they look at it. 
Eventually there will be a unified view, but for now; welcome two the wild west of regulation.

Because I buy the 1 btc back.     
I had 1BTC, now I have 1BTC + $50.     
I'm not ignoring the $1000 investment, it's on my mind.     
The trick is that cash offsets your investment.  So I don't have 1000 invested I have 950. Or if you're like me and reinvest,  I didn't buy 1BTC for 1000 I now have 1.1btc.    
Over time it fills in the hole from the market price falling, and generates cash profits.  When (if)  the price rises black to 1000, but now I have 3btc I'm in an even better position.

Bitcoins can't be purchased for $525. 
Coinbase is 525+5.40 in fees and you have to give them all of you banking and identification information. 
Bitstamp is 525 + the bank transfer fees (which can be anywhere from  $25 to 5%) + the exchange fees, and you have to give them all of you banking and identification information.   The rest of the exchanges are even more shady and risky.  
So the fair Street price of a bitcoin is is at least bitstampusd+1%, add on a few % for convenience and anonymity and you easily get to bitstampusd+6%.    
Which is  $560 for a $525 market.  
That's before we take into account localized supply/demand.      
Most Localbitcoins offers are fair price, once you consider what you "the buyer" is asking for.

Amazon charges up to 30% forum services, marketing, updates, etc. 
People will pay amazon 10% for the a-to-z guarantee alone.    
If you want Coinbase to guarantee your orders and protect against fraud they will charge fees as well.     
I think it would cool, but come on.  
Amazon ain't free because it costs money to operate their business.    
If Coinbase was free it would be more like Craigslist, with its own serial killers.

Yes, FINCEN has significant guidance for virtual currency. They are treating it as a currency for "wealth transmission" to prevent/hinder money laundering.    
The IRS is treating it as property for Tax collection.

But we can't, because you don't believe in studies. And then we run into all sorts or problems; what's normal? Everyone around me has a half acre or larger yard, so for me that's normal.   
Average owners? Again everyone I know sees the animals as part or the family and not property, as such the animals are treated with respect and consideration for their needs valued. So for me that's an average owner. 


Oddly, the study I linked studies average owners, in average conditions; that's why I picked it. And if you did read it you'll find out why you are wrong. 


Again week find ourselves debating the definition of a word; what is a pet? Is it an animal kept for pleasure and recreation, and not for work or food?      
Then I personally know of a dozen pet horses, and the laws in my location in fact classify horses not  as livestock, but as a pet. 


This again is your opinion based on your seemingly limited experience with animals. 
I'll continue to agree that that, like a horse, a pitbull, elephant, donkey, or pig, are all a stupid choices for a pet if you are not able to care for it.   
I will continue to disagree that mistreating an animal in a way that amounts to torture is the animals fault.

Transactions are broadcast instantly, if you are the receiver waiting for confirmation is up to you, but unless it's a sizable amount it's not generally worth the wait.  
Small items, less than $100 require about 10seconds, after that any double spends would be detectable.     
Even larger amounts are nearly impossible to fake at this point, just because on the shear computer power required.

My concern here is three fold.      
* The total daily transaction value for bitcoin is skewed, for several reasons.  If I send 1btc to Localbitcoins, LBC then moves that 1btc to their pocket, then they send is to the person I sold it to.       
In all this could get counted as 3btc volume, when it's really just 1btc.     
The same is said for Coinbase, and every other similar service.   
* After that you should exclude people moving their own money, no one WesternUnions themselves money.     
* Lastly if I want to send you $1k for you to pay some emergency bill, and you need cash in hand right now, bitcoin is still useless.  PayPal has a debit card that works everywhere, and WesternUnion hands you cash.    
Bitcoin is a 4 day wait, or you hunt down someone with cash.   
What WesternUnion and PayPal need to do is assimilate bitcoin, not try to compete with it, or kill it.

Number 2 on your list is just fucking stupid.   
Coinbase isn't responsible for the time an ACH takes to clear; nor are they hand selecting buys to honor.   
I've had countless buys go through after a large increase, each time the amount of BTC I've gotten hasn't changed.     
The only time this happens is on massive volume days (SR get shut down) and they don't quote you a price until the dust settles.     
That is only after their supply is depleted, normally only lasts a couple hours, and there is an additional pop-up box you have to authorize to place the order with a giant fucking disclaimer.    
All the rest of you complaints are equally dumb, as they are all user error driven, or simple mistakes that could be cleared up with an email to Coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:16:44
Look through my posts, you'll see I'm not a zealot.   
Currently bitcoin requires more attention to be paid than most are accustomed to, because they are use to the chargeback.    
I can easily take your CC issue and apply it to the thousands of people that claim to have charges initiated against their accounts either accidentally of fraudulently.    
In these cases the banks automatically give away your money, and you have to fight to get it back, with bitcoin you can't pull a payment it must be sent. 
The system has flaws, some of those flaws are users being careless. This one is a combination of you possibly not researching the company (I've not either so I'm not implying this information is available on their site), and a company having a shit policy.    
If it's not refundable, then they need full disclosure.

Who cares? If I have 3000USD and want to get those funds to a family member ~~in another country~~ what are my options?         
**WU**: I walk in, hand them cash, they take $5 and send my money. My family members then picks up those funds at their location a few days later. 
**Bitcoin**: I spend God knows how long figuring out what it is, and why I should use it. Then I figure out how to buy it. Coinbase will charge me $30.15 amd a 4 day wait; localbitcoins will charge me $150+ depending on vendor picked.     
Now I have to explain to whomever why the fuck I'm sending them bitcoin, and how they can exchange them back into cash.  Coinbase would again take $27.15 and a 4 day wait, but if we each had US Bank accounts I'd have just transferred the funds directly. Back at localbitcoins I could sell them if I want an immediate sale I have to accept another $130 or more loss, or I can arrange to sell them at or above market price. This may take several days to a week, possibly longer. Once I get a buyer I have to deal with them.

I agree debate is good, that's why I'm having a civil conversation with this person.    
Ultimately this is a much more complicated solution to the "price point problem".       
The main function of this solution is to give everyone "more"  bitcoins.  And when it gets to big again, then what?  Just split it again?     
Why have 8 divisions if we are just going to keep splitting it?    
Let's pretend this idea should be entertained:      
As you said, who would decide how much to the split should be?        
When would it be implemented?       
What changes need to be made to the protocol to change the coin cap, coinbase, etc?        
What changes would every market, wallet, and user need to make to ensure they are now on the new system?      
This would create a hard fork, (for every split) and two (or more) bitcoins, making ita horrible idea, because some people won't accept the split.     
In all its obvious that the simple solution in which none of these problems exist and is already being phased in:    mBTC

Wall Street would legitimize bitcoin instantly, and would allow all that money to flow easily into the btc market cap. That's good for everyone holding, which is everyone here I suspect.

If I understand you correctly, you're saying that when you went to buy 1btc @ $610 and the exchange service said "that'll be $780", you just said "ok".       
And later when you went to sell @ $960 and they said "we'll give you $790", and again you say "ok".    
Yet somehow you were cheated because you can't count?       
This instant you saw such a large discrepancy in price you should have told them to fuck off; but the fact you got gouged once and then went running back to the same service to sell, demonstrates you simply were not paying attention.    
So you paid no attention to buying/selling your investments and your surprised it didn't work out?     
**Edit**      
So I went and checked out this [Safello](     
And no wonder you got screwed, here is their explanation for how they get the price:     
   
*Price*        
The estimated price that is shown during order processing **is only an estimation and will most likely differ** from the final price. The purchase is always carried out at market price **at the current market place Safello has chosen to conduct business** on. At the time of exchange, **a fee** according to current agreement will be deducted from the paid sum [stated elsewhere **as 4%**]. The remaining sum will be exchanged to Bitcoin at market price. The fee includes **25% VAT**.      
So out of the gate you're paying  29% in fees, and getting what ever price they choose from whatever exchange they choose.

The distribution of wealth isn't always a problem.    
Wealthy people can afford expensive commodities, can afford to invest and to loan. 
If everyone on the planet had 0.003btc, then your most expensive good could only be a portion of that. 
A lot of "anti bankers" or people that think that rich ruin countries forget that the rich buy things, build things, hire people to do things for them. 
If everyone was equal in wealth who would want to collect trash, or make fries at McDonald's. Is the usher at a movie theatre to make the same as a doctor? 
Rant aside, bitcoin solves the problem because supply is limited unlike government fiat. So even if satoshi had 99% of the bitcoin, he'd have to give it away to get things, he couldn't just hold it and wait for more to be printed.

You could design a wallet to just as you say that sends a no fee tx to a crap node, and a high tx fee to a well connected node.  
But nothing stops the double spend from being detected, it only takes seconds for a TX to propagate through the system.  
And all modern wallets are coded to watch for double spend (correct me if this is not) 
So it's not really a useful tactic as I understand, it could be situationally effective, if you've found a vendor that isn't watching for double spends.  
But this issue also why most sites wait for at least one confirmation before flagging the payment as accepted.

First, bitcoins settle instantly at all times. The ACH transfer you've decided to pay with takes 4 days.    
With bitstamp you wire them funds, wait 4 days while it clears, lose some in fees, then buy bitcoin instantly.     
With coinbase you buy bitcoins, lock in a price with a 1% fee, then they request funds from your bank, and hold your btc until the wire clears. 
The question is when do you want to wait for your funds to clear; before or after you buy?

I believe this if how *Bears* make money. But this is not an example, it's exactly what I've done, I'll sell btc if the price goes up too.    
Buy btc at X.        
Price falls to Y.       
Sellbtc for Y+10%.     
Immediately buy btc at Y.  
You now have the 10% as profit, because you still have 1btc.  I normally reinvest the 10%, but you could easily keep the cash.      
Ultimately the price of 1btc is irrelevant to me, I'm dealing with the margin.

Yes because it gets harder to mine every day, but your equipment doesn't get better.     
This gear will make half as much each month. After peaking at  2.2btc profit, and then start to cost more to run each day than it makes.    
**Fake numbers for illustration only**    
Difficult is  1, your machine produces 10 btc this month,you spent 1btc on energy       
Difficulty rises to 2, your machine produces 4.6btc this month,  you spent 1btc on energy       
Difficulty rises to 3, your machine produces 1.4 this month,  you spent 1btc on energy    
Difficulty rises to 5, your machine produces less than 1btc,   you spent 1btc on energy       
If this machine cost 14 btc, it looks like a great deal, but after the math it sucks if you can buy 15btc with the usd at an exchange.

Amazon charges from 1% and up depending on the type of item.

No but the people helping to fund Hitler can be held accountable. 
You can't say "shrem was just supporting a safe business" When the operator of that businesses was trying to have people murdered. 
I'm not saying he was involved in the murders, nor am I saying the vendors were.    
Assuming DPR did what he's accused of, then it seems pretty cut and dry as to if he was a "hero".
But atleast you got to bust out Hitler.

If you can open an American bank account, sign up for coinbase.      
Get direct deposit from your employer, buy bitcoin.     
Then you have two options:       
* sell on an exchange that let's you withdrawal to a Mexican bank.        
* Sell for cash via localbitcoins, or the equivalent of Craigslist.      
Option one issue best legally and for explaining income; option two has its legal uses but is seen by most as a way to aquire cash.

Because you can't buy 3k on any exchange without drastically moving the price. 
For example: If you wanted 6k btc buying all at once on just Bitstamp would coat you 4 million, and you'd have to buy every bitcoin up to about $730.         
In addition Bitstamp has fees even 0.5% is another $20k. Then there is transfer fees, etc.  
You could of course spread this out over multiple exchanges, over weeks, to minimize your affect on the market, and hope the price doesn't move on you, or you can buy them $680 (wild guess) from the USMS.

I routinely sell for 10-15% over Bitstamp.  People that want anonymity, same day cash buys are willing to pay for that service.     
Add to that that the seller may be breaking all sorts of laws doing this in the first place, on the buyer may be looking to break laws, there is plenty of reason to justify a high premium.

I've ran into this the first time I used them. You need to have enough for the following:       
The trade amount       
The fee         
Network fees        
That last one is where they get you, they hold like 0.01btc for tx fees.    
In the details of that deal it will tell you what you need plus fee, but it doesn't include the network hold.      
It does disclose this someplace just check the faq or wallet pages, after the first time just let that amount sit in the account, it's only a few bucks.   
I've done well over 50 trades since then and never had an issue
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:47:11
BIP38 is a way to take a simple pass phrase and use it to encrypt your private key. That way your private key can be stored unsecured (don't do it on purpose, but it's protection).      
You still want to use a decent pass phrase (not password), but there is a post floating around here of a  3 or 4 character BIP38 key that remains unbroken for a couple months now. (I'll see if I can find it)  
Follow the instructions at bitaddress.org to make a BIP38 and you'll be set. You can print out a bunch of paper back ups too. 
A brain wallet is just like BIP38 except you'll lose all the money you put in it because there are people who do nothing but look for crappy brain wallets.     
They work like this:    
You pick a word/phrase "correct horse battery staple" and enter it into a converter which generates a private key.      
The problem is that you WILL NOT pick a secure phrase. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 21:52:22
TL/DR: Bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:12:56
The simplest way to do this (to protect against simple following) is to send the money to your localbitcoins account.        
Let the funds sit for 3 confirmations at which time they will transfer it to a wallet they control.        
Then request a payout, it will (at least everytime I have tried) from a different address.    
And you're done, anyone not employing some higher end technology will now be following the wrong chain of transactions.  
Obviously for more security you can break it up into some rnd amounts, and use more then one site, make more than 1 withdrawal from each site.      
This has the benefit of actually not being a mixing/laundering service should questions about them ever arise. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:40:43

While all the alts follow bitcoins price, it's only so far as up or down*.

* does the exchange have deposit fees    
*does the exchange have minimum deposit        
* volume of exchange (good price but nothing for sale isn't that useful)       
* fees for each transaction on exchange           
* which currency does the exchange support       
* does the exchange have minimum withdrawal         
* does exchange have withdrawal fees    
* how long does I take to get your funds out of the exchange        
* what is the cost to transfer funds from exchange

Most of the projector manufacturers  have/had (sony, barco, christie all did) deals where they paid for the projector and the site paid increased film rentals or agreed to other terms.    
This allowed many companies, not just drive ins, to upgrade without having to fork over large amounts of cash.   
Most of the sites in trouble currently are ones that didn't make arrangements for the end of film, or thought they'd hold out for better offers.   Digital cinema is the end of film, I don't feel bad for anyone who gets left behind.

Production Cost is absolutely not tied to demand, that's Market Price. 
If my production cost is flat (and in this case it is: the rig had a flat cost, it consumes X watts at $Y/perHour) , but my product rate is halved then the Cost of Goods doubles for me regardless of what the market rate is. 
Now if market rate doesn't leave a profit margin then I have to adjust my production; hold my commodity until the prices rises; go broke; etc.

True, you'll have to save the number once. Unless I can open my Coinbase wallet and just type "Microsoft" and it knows because Microsoft has registered their account. As for sending money to regular accounts, again you're correct, but that's done by the account creator. So if I send funds via PayPal I enter that information and you can send me money. No problem for you.  
Namecoin hasn't been adopted because it doesn't work well. They released something before they had a way to use it.  Imagine if TOR didn't have the bundle, how many people that use its now wouldn't simply because it's hard to get working otherwise? Namecoin also suffers from a squatter's effect where the early people can just gobble up addresses.  Using Microsoft again as an explample: Namecoin forces me to register every variation of my name, and typo before someone else does. The "benefit" of namecoin is that we can't prevent a scam site from using a simple typo version of my property.   As a business owner I'm not excited about Namecoin, it's an Arms Race and one don't intend to participate in.  So basically I think namecoin is a crap comparison.   
Lastly, and most importantly; your solution is simpler for now. It's a kick the can down the road solution.  What happens ⁿ years from now when the digits in a transaction id have doubled? Tripled? How long until your method is actually longer than an address?  This alone makes it not a viable solution.

This is where you just make shit up to justify your point.
I sell stuff on ebay and amazon, I buy stuff on both of them as well. I've never done a chargeback, and never once disputed an item. I've only ever had one item I sold disputed; By a lady who bought a printer, and 7 days later (after using it, it turned out) wanted a refund because it wasn't a fax machine. And Amazon sided with her. 
In this conversation I said they were prone to fraud. People around here like to talk and dream about a *Free Market*, and half the time it ends up with "well we can just use an escrow". And what happens when Items ship, funds are in escrow and there is a dispute? I imagine a similar system to what EBay and Amazon use. Remember the Silk Road, they had escrow and a dispute system, and there was constant rumors of fraud orchestrated by the Dispute Operators.

Bitcoin will require you to make an effort, as you've found out.      
A step in the right direction woukd be taking the initiative to learn, maybe start by Googling 2FA. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 01:45:03
Simply it means you need 2 things to access the account.   
Like a password and a random code sent to your phone via sms. 
If you have an android Google Authenticator is active for tons of things.
This way even if someone gets your username and password, they would still need your phone. 
Don't set it up to send the code to an email address. But you should have have clean email for all cryptocurrency related activities and 2FA it.   That will protect your accounts from people trying to reset features.    
**2FA EVERYTHING BITCOIN RELATED**

True, however FinCEN treats it as a "virtual currency" and regulates it as any other currency. 


Actually in the US both parties could engage in money laundering even if no "criminal" funds are involved. Money Laundering is simply the act of concealing, attempting to conceal, or transferring funds between individuals without complying with Know Your Client, and/or Anti-Money Laundering regulations.        
It just happens that criminals routinely engage in money laundering.      
In addition operating an unlicensed Money Service Business is a crime as well because of how easy money laundering can be, even if unintentional.   


If your business sell currency then yes, your protected however by your MSB license, KYC regulations, and the fact that you followed law recorded identity information, reported suspicious transactions, and aided law enforcement.

But bitcoin isn't a marketing gimmick.

But as I said it's just one piece of the security system, and in this particular case would have prevented the loss from ever happening.

I'm really confused by your comment.    
Who cares if the power goes out? If the thing printed as in step 1 no problem.   I the power goes out part way, just print another one once you have power.  
Edit:  
The wallets aren't prrloaded, they are are generated each time you power the device. So it's impossible to preload a wallet for which no public key exists.

You said the universe was mostly black (another surprising mixup for an astrophysicist) matter. I was merely pointing out that not only did you not know what it was called, you were also technically incorrect. Most of the universe is filled with Dark Energy, not matter. All the matter accounts for about 28% of everything.

If this was a publicly traded company there would be some legal issues, if you were an investor or partner in the company you would have a legal claim to that information.    
As it stands it was a company you decided to do business with. Let me ask you this in all seriousness:       
When did MtGox's solvency or P&amp;L sheets become an issue for you?       
I suspect you, and most others, didn't care how the business was ran while you were making money. But now that there is widespread concern that it may be over, suddenly there are "legal" questions that need to be answered.

MtGox has been blasted for a year now as a horrible place to keep money.   SR(and the rest) was an illegal market place (in most places).

It's possible, all an exchange would have to do is let people sell bitcoins not in there account.      
But people wouldn't stand for it, if you bought $2k in btc, then 3 hours later were told the sale was reversed, you'd be pissed.    
After a few times people would find out that this exchange was supporting this behavior and people would drop them.    
Unlike wall street, we have choices with btc.     
Most people would agree this is fraud, the SEC sorta agrees, this exchange would be abandoned, or be like Gox, where people just chuckle when it's mentioned.

I think where we disagree is that, I feel not providing an adequate environment for an animal is mistreating it.   
To a pitbull being cooped up most of the day, or stuck in a small yard and neglected is mistreating it.    
Much like the elephants in my example, they are not attacked, but they are not provided what they need. There are plenty of reports that demonstrate that cooped and neglected animals lash out, nor just pitbulls. 
I know several people with Pits that are as docile as a rabbit, but these dogs spend hours and hours chasing each other on several acres of land. 
Where we agree in that people who can't properly care for these animals shouldn't have them. But the fact that a properly cared for pitbull is perfectly safe tells me that it's not the dog but the conditions in which they are kept.

The easiest explanation is that none of the Bank apps directly send funds. Technically you request that your bank transfer funds.      
This is also the case with PayPal, they do the sending, they hold all the funds. While PayPal may draw from your bank account, you can't send direct P2P payments with it.      
Bitcoin wallets on the other hand allow for direct P2P payments, without a KYC AML organization in the middle.     
Ultimately i suspect this is the  what Apple's lawyers have advised them.

Did you bother reading at all about how coinbase works, prior to giving them $600?       
When you bought the btc and that box popped up giving you an expected deliver date, did you read that?      
8 ago days isn't 8 "business" days ago, in fact its 3, with today being the 4th, if you check out your transaction history in your account it will tell you what day coinbase said to expect delivery which is probably close of business today.

I agree the valuation of bitcoin seems unjustifiably high currently provided it's still limited usefulness as a daily currency.

It's not as simple as a one time split, if the miners pay out  a 1:1000 ratio to all addresses this opens a lot of issues.     
* transaction fees: easy to fix.      
* does the block reward need to be proportionally increased as well to keep the value of bitcoin surpressed?     
- if not, what will the do yard the price as the coinbase is drastically reduced.   
- if yes,  what effect does this have on the coin cap? Does it need to be proportionally increased.     
- all exchanges would have to shut down during the transition, god forbid 1/1000 of a bitcoin gets sold at $750.    
- once the exchanges open and there are now a thousand more bitcoins in the market what does that do to price?   
This goes on.

Joe has to spend $100k a year just to potentially earn $1k, let's assume the fine print doesn't exist (lol, no fine print).     
Now how much did Joe spend this year on fees to have such a glorious card and such a wonderful bank?   
Do you have any idea? Because that gets subtracted from the 1 grand. 
My point is in America (I presume elsewhere) people aren't spending 100k a year when they are only making 30k. 
So now let's assume Average Joe is able to spend half that amount in a Manor that provides rewards and he's managed to earn $150.          
Subtract from that account fees for the card, the bank accout, possible interest on the card, fees for using it overseas or paying foreign vendors (3-5% is common)  and you're average person will chew up that $150 by the end of the year.

Not really on the Android app you can set them up, label them and ignore it a that point.  
Maybe I've been spoiled by the functionality of it, I have to assume iOS can handle multiple email addresses in the stock app.  
But once you set them up, it's really easy to use.  
I group mine a tad more than I implied.  
I basically have emails for Banking, Crypto Banking, Crypto Risk (bter, poloniex, etc), Bills account, Merchant account (for Amazon, eBay, Paypal), and account for MMOs, and lastly a trash account for basically everything else. 
So 6 emails, not that hard. And I get the confidence of knowing that if poloniex gets hacked all they get is an email address used for accounts I don't keep much money in, and I don't have to worry about that bleeding over into my bank account.  
Tale a couole hours and set it up, you won't regret it.

Here is a question and I apologize in advance if I use a term wrong.  
I have been selling a lot of Bitcoin as the price falls.  
I had *bought* 1btc at $900, which I sold for $650. Does that mean I can claim a loss of $250?  
At that time the market price of btc was $600, so went and bought another 1btc.    
In my mind I had a $50 profit, because I still had my 1btc,  but can I also claim the $250(or $200) loss on my taxes?

But requires more confirmations for the same security. 


That's an opinion, and one many disagree with.   It's hashing algorithm makes it inefficient on purpose, for what isn't even a clear benefit.     
Large scale investment in ASIC design and manufacture makes it financial resistant to corruption. Litecoin I cheaper to manipulate because it's easier to do. 


Agreed.      
But this whole litecoin is silver. . .  blah blah blah is just wrong.  
Bitcoin and litecoin have nearly instant transaction broadcasting, within seconds double spends can be checked.       
The only benefit of litecoin is highly debated.     
The only reason to take anything other than bitcoin is to make a point, or support a underdog that you have a vested interest in.

100% agree, I didn't lose a single satoshi to Gox or any of the SR sites.   
I have bitcoin on my phone: never lost any; on my windows pc: never lost any; and in a paperwallet: never lost those either.   
Far as I can tell bitcoin is way safer than CC, as my debit cards have been compromised 4 times. 
Nevertheless every day people are advised to treat btc like a gold bar, and hide it.  
Every day people come here to talked about the btc they have lost and will never see again.

I'm looking for the source as well, I remember a pop up explaining it when I added my card. But I can't find it officially listed either.   
In addition to the NSF fee that your bank will charge you, Coinbase attempts a second withdrawal on the account before charging your card. So that would result in 2 NSF fees, and I believe Coinbase charges $25 NSF themselves, not sure of that would be twice as well.  
So it's actually +5% +~$100, on top of the 1% you were charged anyway.  
So as soon as I find a source you'll see this is a terrible idea.

This is a neat idea, and personally I like it. However i think its a new solution for an old problem, one that has been solved already.   
What I mean is this; the last time you called someone with a cell phone, did you type their complicated seemingly random number in, or select them from a list? How about a sms? When you visit reddit do you deal with the IP and routing or let the DNS system do it four you?   
We have a solution for making long numeric strings usable, we hide them and use common language instead.   For money PayPal, Amazon, etc already do this, when you pay a friend you use their name and email, you don't need too enter their banking info everytime.   
I suspect Coinbase and others are hard at work creating a registration of addresses much like dns, that way when I pay Microsoft for Windows 12, I simply send my payment to "Microsoft" and the rest if done by the software.

@_date: 2014-07-15 02:05:18
Funny thing, it can't.     
This has been shown time and time again. If I want to send USD to my brother, in another state, using BTC it is a massive pain in the ass.
Even assuming I already have the BTC, he still has to convert it to USD, while Coinbase is by far the cheapest and safest way, it is not even remotely "next day".     
That leaves LBC, which can range from "same day" to "next week . . maybe" and leaves you with anywhere between a -10% to +10% balance in USD. The major flaw is finding a buyer quicker than converting at Coinbase would be. (which this sub demonstrates can be challenging in some locations.)
Bitcoin remains a massively shitty way to transmit small amounts of funds that need to be utilized as a local currency to the receiver.   
I find it great as a wealth storage unit, as a speculative instrument, and as an international payment protocol, but a "Hey dude spot me $50" it blows.

Honestly there is no technical difference. *Bitcoins* aren't stored anywhere, they exist in the blockchain.  What people store are private and public keys.   
For common vernacular, we say bitcoins, but it's not correct.    
The difference becomes, how best to secure the private key, and thus your "right to spend" a transaction.    
A computer can make use of software to manage and spend, a paper wallet can not.    
A computer is also vulnerable to theft more than a paper wallet.   
It all comes down to security, that's why people say to keep a low volume key on a computer, and the bulk key offline.   
Edit:  
You can back up wallet software and continue to store that backup on a computer, so the backup isn't secure unless you gets it offline.

Option 2: invest the 10k in btc directly and get 11.65btc now (coinbase price)     
You tell me which one is better for that 10k/btc in 6 months?        
Unless you are mining on an industrial scale it is always less profitable than buying the bitcoin directly.

So a reddit account that is 4 years old, but who's first post was last month, is asking us to provide at least $5k and our ID information to participate in the USMS bitcoin auction.      
We are to be assured because you claim to be associated with some other companies, yet neither of them have any official announcement of involvement that I can find.     
You are spamming your post, indicating a scam, and the only real information on your site is how much money you will keep when your bid doesn't get picked. It doesn't, which isn't surprising, say what will happen when your fund doesn't reach the government minimum? I suspect it will be the same $100 fee from everyone dumb enough to give you money.   
You claim to have restricted yourself from bidding, but there is no contract, no legal reason to prevent you from abusing your position.    
Until you get an official release, and put your face and identify in public this is a scam, and I will copy paste this every time you repost this.

Keep in mind that's an aspect of Coinbase not bitcoin. In addition, bitcoin is a different monetary system and you should expect some delay/cost when moving funds between systems.
With that said, you can use localbitcoins or Mycelium Trader and have bitcoin in hand today probably within the next hour if you wanted, you can even use your Coinbase wallet to hold those funds should you choose. 
Bitcoin is instant once you have it, if you had funds on an exchange (like Coinbase) you could exchange for BTC instantly because you've already got USD there. 
As you've discovered the main disadvantage to new comers is entry delay. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 16:51:54
Because they aren't charging micropayments.      


That billed at the end of the month is the part you missed.  There is only 1 transaction per account per month.  A true micropayment system could be established with bitcoin.   
So basically after 63 articles a month you're just billed a flat rate.  This is just a pay-as-you-go subscription with a max charge cap.

Your example is pretty obvious, Forex needs the license because they are engaging in business. You are just a client.  
If you intend to operate a bitcoin exchange you either get licensed or do so illegally, it doesn't matter if that exchange is digital or physical, just like Forex or a currency converter at an international airport you need a license.  You also need to follow all AML and KYC laws regarding your clients.

Just another "I don't fucking read offers completely and feel scammed when I don't get what I want" 


How exactly? Under the first offer had you completed a qualifying buy while it was active (which according to your statement didn't happen) you would have been eligible for $0. Under the new offer you had a qualifying buy and received $10. This seems to indicate that you're also unclear what "costing" means.  
You could make the argument your friend (who I assume you expected to split the referral money with you) got $65 less than they would have, had your buy qualified under the first offer. So i guess he shouldn't have waited so long to refer you. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:30:03
I think part of the confusion is caused by your word choice; and partly because of how Coinbase functions.  I see 3 real options:  


In this case the transfer clearly wouldn't count, since no buy is included or implied. 


No issue since the time of the buy is the only thing I question. 


Here is the only place there is a dispute, does the fact both parties agreed on a product, price and payment method constitute the sale,  or as Coinbase says is the sale officially withheld till you have funds? 
Your position in this example would be reasonable, on the 29th we entered an agreement of sale, any transfers are irrelevant. Coinbase's position is that they agreed to sell you X BTC at $Y once you had funds in your account.  
Both sides are valid on face value, however Coinbase's TOS most likely favor them.  I'm sure you can pay a lawyer to argue just about anything but it will certainly not be worth the $50 your disputing. Maybe you can get on Judge Judy? 
@_date: 2015-10-19 21:36:26
You can "see" whatever you like, but explain to me what words I'm misusing?   
The offer has always read as " If your friend visits coinbase.com/buys and purchases $100 USD or more (or 100 EUR, or 100 GBP, or 100 CAD, or 100 SGD) of bitcoin..." this clearly indicates the offer is extended contingent on a purchase as I've said; not on initiating a deposit or transfer as you've implied.  You're attempting to justify you complaint by assuming that the purchase happens at the start of transfer when Coinbase has been clear that your purchase is made once funds have transferred. 
You keep saying you "initiated a quality transfer" but the offer as written doesn't say a word about transfers, it's dependent on a purchase.   
So did you attempt to purchase bitcoin and get caught in the ach transfer delay; or did you attempt to deposit funds into your Coinbase account? Because your description sounds like the second. 
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:49:53

The classic 1% Fallacy 
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:42:56
You assume the offer was made when you transfer funds or initiated a buy; when in fact yhe offer is made once you complete a buy: defined as your payment clearing and btc being transferred.  
When the offer was made the terms had changed from what you wanted, and new terms were in place. 
It really is quite simple as you point out.  In the end you missed that promotion, not at of malice but because your referral came late, and the delay transferring funds caused you to miss it. It's not Coinbase's fault your bank is slow at transfers, nor that you waited so long to accept a referral. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 18:34:01


No they didn't, thats where your confused. 
The offer was made when you completed a purchase/buy, not upon initiating a deposit or transfer. 


Wrong, the offer was clearly stated as being contingent on completing a purchase. 


Absolutely, after the transfer you can complete a buy and accept the offer extended.  The source of confusion seems to be your misunderstanding of when the offer was made.

Here in the US that is not accurate we have Legal Tender in the form of USD, but you are not obligated to take it. (for example, lots of stores don't accept bills over the Twenty, while there is Legal Tender in larger denominations) 
Legal tender is valid for debts public and private, but not mandatory for commerce.

Is a Super Crash like this a bad thing, there could be several positive effects.
1) Gox would be gone, and people would expect more from exchanges. 
2) While the price is low, and all the attention Bitcoin is getting now, this could give reason for a lot of on the fence people to buy in that are put off by the idea of trading a $100 bill for "That computer money" (as my friends call it).  Would the price dropping to half suck for those of us who got in at over $80 sure, but we knew that was an option and it will rise again.
3) Say what you want about the exchanges that are not complaint or don't service USD Banks, but what about places like Coinbase? Did they ruin anonymity or just the illusion of it? One way or another real governments are going to have to weigh in and set rules for how Bitcoin works under their rule.  This will happen long before you can stroll into the grocer and by food, before petro stations are going to allow you to pay at the pump, etc. The anarchos will never admit it, but main stream requires official sanction. If the the only exchanges left play by the rules, that helps.
4) Massive mining rigs may be unprofitable, Oh god we wouldn't want the average joe back in charge of securing the network would we?
If a crash like this happened how many people here would buy more when you thought it was at the bottom? how many would buy a little here and there as it falls, who would sell some, only waiting to buy back a lower prices?

Coinbase lvl2 only matters if you want larger volume, or instant access to the coins.    
For you, sounds like it's not necessary. 
I took the amount I wanted to invest in btc, and bought in for half that amount at once, then I bought in the rest over time as I thought the price was "good". 
The alt coins are even more of a risk than btc. I had traded some btc for ltc, but once the exchange rate trippled I converted back, and haven't looked back.

The changes only affect Chase BusinessSelect Checking and Chase BusinessClassic, how many account types to they have? Do they have account types for higher volume clients? What percentage of their clients does this change affect?    
Notice how none of the obvious next questions were asked or answered by this article. 
Next we see that Chase business savings account holders can no longer send wire transfers from a savings account, guess that's why they have checking account options that allow that.

To start the price is $125.12 right now not $140. Don't pay any mind to Gox or any averages that include it. 
Second your transaction is honored at the price it was confirmed for, so in your case 1btc for $115.  You will receive 1btc.  
Coinbase has a stockpile of btc, you bought one from them at that time, and they effectively set it aside for you while your account clears.

Coinbase is a company ran by about 8 people; 10k people a day sign up for its service; this week the passed 650k active accounts.    
If just 0.1% (probably a low figure if this sub is any indication) of these people sends an email each week it would be 93 emails a day.  Assuming an average response/solution every 10 minutes (which is unrealistically low); it would take over 15 hours a day to do nothing but answer these emails.     
So yeah, I takes then a bit to get to you.  They did just get $25million in funding, I'm sure some CS personal is high on that list, considering the jobs a posted on their website.

But as explained to you elsewhere, no one is still mining with 650watts per GH, realistically you are looking at less than 5, so your calculations are off by x130.    
So your $15,387,700 becomes $118,367.     
Now divide that by 60,435 and you get a cost of only $1.95.    
It won't take much growth, combined with more efficient machines to get this number very small.    
Once those Miners are running sub 1 watt/GH machines (which are being used now) and the usage doubles well then you have to cost of only:        
$0.10 each.    
That's not an outrageous growth by next year.

The great thing about the system is that with all units identical no one can "mark" my bitcoins.    
While ever US Dollar has been serial number bitcoins don't.    
You can't ban my bitcoins, you can't freeze my accounts. The system is free from a controlling entity and it's agenda.    
That is why there is such vile hatred towards the Coin Validation people, they want to create a central authority to monitor and control spending.

@_date: 2013-11-29 00:28:58


Technically you don't know how to do math.       
That is what I call The Miners Fallacy.    
Lets say you have a choice between spending $100 on a miner or 10btc.    
And that miner is only going to produce 7btc before the difficulty shuts it down, than no matter what the value of a bitcoin reaches the 10btc will always be worth more than the 7. 
What you're saying is that the USD value has been paid off, but who cares what we all want is bitcoins and your mining contract produces far less then simply buying bitcoins would. 
All these mining contracts are a scam          
There is no proof this equipment even exists, you simply take money, buy btc, and send a small amount of it back to people too stupid to know any better, and tell them "some day the value will go up and you'll break even"

Not this nonsense again.


No they didn't just 2 low level (read low fee schedule) accounts; BusinessSelect Checking and BusinessClassic


No they wont, they are limiting the "free" cash transactions to that, and will be charging the 2 accounts in question a fee for moving around more than that.


Again its just these 2 accounts that can no longer send international wires, they have accounts available to people that offer this type of service.


The bank is restructuring some low volume business accounts that had services attached to them, which were used to conduct fraud. JP Chase is still under investigation, and is making changes to accounts that don't generate enough revenue to cover the new administrative costs to oversee these services.
Thats it. There is no Conspiracy here.

Its been around since 1799, its called the Metric System.  
Take the base unit in this case "a satoshi" better referred to as "a bit" and then just apply the increasing labels:   kilo, mega, giga, etc.    
For large amounts just continue to use btc, and apply the same metric labels.   
This is all you need, prices don't have to be small whole numbers. Most of the world already has inflated prices for things, look at India, Russia, China, Japan, look at the exchange rates, and what a Bitcoin is worth in local currency.

@_date: 2013-11-04 22:01:39
No one asked about the price.   
The question was why every time there is a big shift in price, coinbase "runs out of bitcoins" until someone fixes the problem.    
Yet a month or so later it happens again.   
Is this a hot wallet runs dry, and someone has to reload it? Is there some limit on the account they buy from the market with?    
Is it something else?

I always laugh when people complain a price I "above market".   
In addition to what I as said below, you can't just look at the cheapest exchange and think you can get that price.   The price listed doesn't reflect the cost to get funds to the exchange.   
The real price of a bitcoin on any exchange I on average +5% higher then the trade value.     
After that you have the 1week or longer wait for the bank transfers to post.   
Maybe the seller buys from an exchange that has a higher price than the one you picked as "market".    
You should also expecte to pay for the ease of getting them within an hour and for cash, without ID verification.   
So "market"  price would be the actual cost to aquire the btc, and a "fair" price would be market with a reasonable commission.     
If you don't like that, you can always wire you funds to Slovenia, wait a week, do that verifications, and buy them yourself.

These are two separate (but related) issues people are trying to lump together. 
The savings account form from peaktopeak.org is so far an isolated issue of one school using a savings account to conduct wire transfers.
The check service downgrade is clearly an attempt to get more fees from people by pushing them into higher accounts to maintain service. 
Chase offers a variety of accounts, just because two no longer offer these services isn't a disaster, if this becomes a pattern across banks, and span a large section of their accounts then I think there would be call to alarm. But a single bank, restructuring 2 low level business accounts is not, in my opinion cause concern.

Your first purchase went through on a highly volatile day.   
When that happens coinbase can run out of stock, and they offer to process you order when stock is available.      
At whatever rate that happens to be.    
There is always a message about this on the buy screen, and an extra confirmation.   
Their standard practice is to honor trades at the time executed and deliver when funds clear.

With coinbase your funds stay in the US, for cashing out I call that an advantage.   Coinbase also pays higher than bitstamp. 


I've gotten them from both, no issues, but again coinbase is an American company, some banks my have an easier time accepting large freak tx from them.

I just assumed he researched the company he was giving his bank info to.      
And assuming he saw the posts here and else where about coinbase being a scam that get posted every few minutes his spider sense should have gone off. 


Because it's an option but not required, nothing is perfect, so why risk it? 


I agree, and people deserve scrutiny for making stupid choices about what information they type into their computers.        
They have a secure method, I use them several times a week, they decided on fast and less secure.       
As of yet there is no evidence that coinbase I compromised (as pointed out by others, they may not even have entered their info into the real coinbase site), so it's just as likely (some might say more likely, given the fact these reports aren't flooding in) that the user's computer was/is compromised.

Coinbase isn't a scam, they are a small company that is getting hammered with an influx of business.

Step one would probably stop trying to be a dick and just read.   
If you understood bitxoin, then you would realize how foolish it is to think you could buy them with credit cards (credit cards can be reversed for any reason for up to 180 days, bitcoin is irreversible. Who would risk that theft?) you can't use paypal, because it's a credit card middle man, that has blatantly said they don't recognize digital goods as products, so again scammers can just take their money back, so who would do it?    
For what it's worth you can buy then with paypal on ebay, you just pay a large/huge markup today cover the cost of theft. 
As far as generating them on your computer, that part should be removed. While it's true, it's not a realistic option for people anymore. 
You have cash you said? Well localbitcoins most likely has sellers. Guess what. . .  They take cash.

You can store funds on an exchange for instant purchases; does coinbase do that?

Do you think the entire credit card industry was ran on less then $15, 387,700 yesterday?     
It didn't.

[MasterCard](   is between $8.8-10.7 million.        
Discover is closed but assuming they run simular profit margins they are looking at $6.3-8.0 million a day.        
[American Express](  the king of kings is dropping between $72-86.2 million each and every day.

What happens when you have an exchange like Gox, after the first month they don't pay everyone else, they get kicked out of the consortium and we are right back to this.
Its not as simple as an API, there has to be a system in place to allow the exchanges to settle with each other. The exchanges have to have an reason to want you to move your money to another exchange. These exchanges have fees, do those get paid and by who?

I think it has to do with demand, they have a pool of coins and only goto bitstamp to fill orders when needed. As demand on their pool rises, so does the price. 
This is most noticed after a drop, when the buying starts, coinbase can be $12 over bitstamp. 
I hope this isn't a way to hide a markup, if they need to go from 1% to 2-3% fine, but I think they are smart enough not to hide it. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 20:55:49

Closed or locked escrow prevents the seller from canceling the exchange.

Sure it's an easy mod to add all 100+ alts, but why bother? People are focusing their efforts on one cryptocurrency, the established one. 
Alts will always exist in its shadow, unless something actually useful comes along and has features that bitcoin can't replicate.

I sell a lot of localbitcoins and few people wait. For the rest, we do this thing called "talking", that passes the time quite nicely. 
I also suspect you've not used localbitcoins, because the seller funds an address held by localbitcoins, so you can tell the funds have cleared before you meet. The seller clicks two buttons and then localbitcoins sends you confirmation that the coins have been sent to you.

This highlights the biggest problem with coinbase, they refuse to treat their account holders like adults. They have my email addresses, bank account, home address, and all me KYC info, but now they need a visa credit (not debit) card? 
If they would have said "starting at x, this goes into effect" it would have been fine. But they decided on another clandestine switch, which is becoming all to routine for them.

You can't,    
You need an exchange account.    
That requires you to have money sitting in there bank account so you can spend it at the moments notice.   
Most (any you'd want to use) also require the same verification as Coinbase.

All the wallets you listed so far are hosted. That means the private keys and thus the bitcoins are under their control.
You want a local wallet that only you have the private keys to, so the bitcoins are truly yours.
As said, with a local wallet you assume responsibility for security and not losing your money.
For normal usage, the [Electrum]( is probably the best for you, unless you need the full blockchain, which is like 10GB now (I think).
Lots of people opt for a dedicated local mobile wallet so your coins are with you all the time, for that there are several options I use the [Schildbach]( its in the google play store, its free.
For you it looks like you want this:
Step 0a: Coins from BTC Guild go into your BTC Guild account.
Step 0b: Coins from Coinbase go into your coinbase account.
Step 1: Create a local wallet
Step 1a: Transfer coins from BTCGuild to your wallet, using a new (optional) receive address assigned to BTCGuild
Step 1b: Transfer coins from Coinbase to your wallet, using a new (optional) receive address assigned to Coinbase
(You don't have to have new addresses each time, but it will make following your money harder, keep in mind all transactions are public record)
At this point you now officially have the bitcoins.
Step 2: Pay Vendor

No.  Sounds like you have a lot of reading to do. If you need to keep track of this information you will need to create a new receive address for each client, and then you can record who you assigned it to.

If I believe in bitcoin, there is even less reason for me to take less of it.     
You are looking at this from the buyers point of view.     
The problem is you aren't trying to convince people to pay with bitcoin, you are trying to convince vendors to accept it; so the incentive goes to them, not you. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:03:57

Are you in thr US? if so it boils down to this:
If you got nothing to hide, want a fair and easy place to buy use coinbase. 
If you'd rather keep your btc activities a secret use local bitcoins/Craigslist qnd only pay in cash. 
There are a bunch of sites that will give you weird ass ways to buy (doesn't one have you buy Sierra Leone currency first?) in secret but they are all sketchy by design.

I think you Google "bitcoin charts"  and click on practically any of the results. 
@_date: 2013-08-17 01:44:35
Yes, now it may practically impossible to prove the address you sent the coins to was a mixer, technically it is money laundering. 
But if the IRS, for example, can prove you bought the btc they can burden you to show were the wealth went. Just like everyone else trying to hid assets. 
The only truly anonymous btc are bought with cash in person. 
@_date: 2013-09-10 01:04:19
I don't want to be rude, but if these are the questions you're asking, you don't need to be trying to use TOR and SR. 
you need to take a step back, read more about bitcoins and the Internet (spoiler: they are not as anonymous as most think)  and then get involved in what ever you choose.  
Clearly SR works, as it is still about, but don't treat it like some quick and easy pit stop or I suspect you'll regret it.

It's important to note that the withdrawals should be made to several addresses, all tied to the same private key, and should be random amounts over an appropriate period of time.

Yes, but they can still follow it, and they will still know how many transactions you have done, if 100 people each get their own all they know is what they did, and they can't prove after a single jump that you still have it, and didn't pay someone yourself. 
Its just safer to give each transaction a new address.

As great as it sounds to invalidate their tx,  and send all the coins that were in SR accounts back to wherever they came from; as others have said this is a horrid precedent. 
What happens when a group decides that Google isn't going to bitcoin right? Or the city of Detroit, or that mega church that you disagree with? Where will it end. 
The point is to have a secured currency that is open and free to all. But nothing stops you from tracking these funds and refusing to accept them. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 20:51:16


  


That's a good call, like all investments there are risks. However bitcoin can be divided down to about 0.000002 USD at the current price. So if you wanted and you asked/looked around (localbitcoins) you could buy a tiny fraction of a bitcoin. 
  


Most people here are going to say Yes. Massive price drops don't last long because people jump on the opportunity for cheap bit. 


You'd earn more money picking up cans and taking them to a recycling plant and then using that money to buy btc.


No, they are middles third party and you have no control over their computers. Always have your own wallet. The only exception to this would be of you know nothing about safety Internet usage and feel you can't learn.    
Then it might be worth the risk of letting coinbase handle the security.

Prove it, or admit you're a liar.    
So, either you know you're a liar and you don't care, or you've got some evidence to back up your claim.
For someone who seems to hate opinions you start off with one?     
I personal find my phone better in every way than apple products.   
The fact that nearly every app is free, activating my phone as a hotspot/wifi hub is free, etc makes the overall cost lower too. 


Prove it, or admit you're a liar.  There is no evidence Google has ever done what you claim.   So, either you know you're a liar and you don't care, or you've got some evidence to back up your claim.
What scam apps is Google shipping, I've never had an android device steal from me? 




You're right.     
Until some corporate executive from apple admits to pulling payment apps that they don't get any revenue from it I speculation.    
Speculation fueled by the fact they have pulled all the apps that let you transfer bitcoins, or accept bitcoins as payment.      
The Coinbase CEO has been quotes as saying it was pulled with out discussion, and no reason was provided.       
The CEO of bitpak was given the following reason " “Because that Bitcoin thing is not legal in all jurisdictions for which BitPak is for sale”." that's not even true. 
Either way the burden is on you, put up or admit you're a mindless apple supporter and a liar.


Well that last part was more of a joke, but you can overreact.  For what it's worth, I have an iPhone and an Android, and after years of using both I like the customization and openness of the android platform better, but I suspect if you need a phone that operates without any higher level brain function then apple makes a great product.

You need to redeem that code and btc-e and then transfer the funds to clear wallet you control.

It wasn't seized because of the amount but because he tried to smuggle it out of the contry. Boo hoo illegally obtained funds were confiscated while being smuggled out the contry, to bad he didn't use bitcoin to break the law, that would just have been harder to detect. 
This is clearly a bitcoin circle-jerk, and if he was an legal worker he could have deposited the money into a bank account and transfered it too. So this is a good example as to why you work legally in and country and follow custom laws and that's it. 
For the record I don't give a shit about "illegal immigrants" and think the laws here are stupid, but they are the laws.

You can store the pvt key locally on your phone, just not sure what options apple products have.    
Keep in mind that you are not storing bitcoins anywhere, what you need to keep safe is the "private key" that acts as your proof of the right to spend. 
Ideally you want to be the only person with that key.   With coinbase they have it, so ultimately they have the bitcoins not you.

I don't think so, nodes check the tx for signatures, balance and things before they broadcast.   
If you received the tx on your client then that means the transaction is valid and the nodes are spreading it.   
That all happens before the tx leaves the node, and before any confirmations.    
So unless there are enough rogue nodes to push it through this isn't an issue.   And if you have that much infrastructure to work with you are either supporting the blockchain or creating your own fork.

Not really, Coinbase is a store not an exchange. For security reasons their sale price waits to verify the incoming price from bitstamp (there was a lot of price manipulation before). 
Coinbase did get down to $92, and there is a fantastic android app that would have allowed you to take advantage of that 20 second window. 
Otherwise you need you money in an actual exchange, that you can respond to split second changes, and have order books.

I don't know why people are down voting all your remarks.    
While I don't entirely agree with your position, I see it's merits, and it's the only one that makes a logical case ad to why the satoshi may just delay the problem.   
While I didn't see an issue with 100M satoshi, I acknowledge it strays from the uniformity. 
My 3 questions to you would be this:     
Let's assume no one is going to refer to prices by bitcoin, and everyone is just using satoshi.    
When time comes to subdivide the satoshi, can't we just start using the SI reduction prefixes then?        
Other than uniformity (not saying it's unimportant) is there a reason for "naming" the uBTC and using it?       
If we name uBTC can we agree it won't be rose, star, tiger like some other people are proposing?

Maybe, but I think it's better to stick to a system, metric in this case, then to have a counting system that is not consistent.    
Right now every thing moves in increments of 1,000, but with satoshi the last one ends with  100, because there are only 8 decimal places instead of 9.   
So either we stick with ubtc and preserve order or do a code change add a decimal place, and use whatever we call:          
0.000000001 as the base unit.       
This isn't a big deal because satoshi practically said 8 was picked out of the hat.

But once one of the alts coins that has nothing to lose (I'm looking at you Feathercoin) works out all the kinks, btc will implement and be right back on top. 
The only current alt coin that is "different" is litecoin, and it's just a  poor mans effort to mine bitcoins.

No problems there. 


Again this is just coinbase, and just to protect coinbase from its users. 
I agree there are issues, but it's not fair to lay them at bitcoins feet.     
Bitcoin wasn't designed to be fluid with the current system.     
I wager it was quite obvious to the developers that it would be quite difficult to move substantial wealth from the banks to bitcoin.     
For most of the world $35k USD is a substantial amount of wealth.    
The old world doesn't want wealth out of its system, so for now it trickles in.    
Bitcoin is after all only a few years old.    
This will change over time, but people shouldn't be surprised they can't move these amounts without problems.

First, I've noticed a pattern emerging with these first time high risk buy stories; they are always for the max allowed. My first buy from coinbase was for 1btc to test them out.    
I then waited 30 days for lvl 2 to clear before I bought again.    
Now I buy all the time, never have to problem.   
Second, the price is a couple bucks higher then several exchanges, but so is the demand. In addition, you have to figure out how much it will cost you to get your money to that exchange and the btc out.     
From the US I've seen reports as hight as 5% in bank fees to get your money to bitstamps account in Slovakia.    
204*1.05=214, so it seems coinbase is still cheaper.
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:23:26
This happened to you, or you just read someone posting on here prior to talking to Coinbase, in which every case i have seen they have manually processed the claim and honored it.
Every purchase I've made with Coinbase has been worth more by the time the transaction clears, and every single one of them has been paid out, hell the last one had over a 17% increase in btc value between start and finish.
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:27:28
At level 2 you can sell 50btc a day,   
Either way you can go to the "sell" tab and enter the amount of btc you want to sell and it will tell you exactly what you will get after fees.

Here is a good example, I ate at a food truck the other day that was credit only. Thinking this was odd and that a business like this would want cash for tax reasons (hear fraud)  I asked the guy. He said it was not safe to use, they were robbed, and now they have a giant sign that says "no cash". 
Now, when he handed me my sandwich and I tried to hand him a Five Dollars bill, he could refuse it at that point I have 3 options:
1) pay in accordance with the agreement. 
2) return the sandwich. 
3) steal the sandwich and make a run for it. 
But just because I am holding the sandwich does not mean they are forced to take the cash.

I'll sell you any amount you want through PayPal.

Once those funds post you have to make a "contributions" to the ruling political party.

So the whole time SR was operating they **think** he earned 600k btc in commissions. How many of those were paid out to employees, himself, or hitman? Bitcoin was only trading for $20 earlier this year. When did he allegedly pay the hitman $80k? That cost him at least 4k btc.

SI is commonly known everywhere but the States (and it's well past time we ditched our archaic methods). It's clean, linear, and compatible with current systems.    
All these suggestions to make up a new counting system will be even more confusing then the one already taught in most schools.   
Giving then names like Rose, Tiger, or Star is just an asinine proposition.   
No one cares if money is sexy, I don't get all weak in the knees when someone says "nickel". 
There is nothing wrong with buying a soda for 0.2 mBTC.   
Or someday for 1 uBTC. 
If we are not going to use a worldwide accepted (something bitcoin needs by the way) way of scaling large numbers, then (as I support as well) just start listing all prices in satoshi(bit).    
At which point we'd still use SI to truncate the numbers.

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.

If you use Chase, then yes. They are a bit hyper diligent these days about money laundering.    
If you have Bank of America, then probably. I've seen quite a few frozen accounts while they wanted answers.    
If you have a Credit Union, most likely not. I sat down with an accountant at the corporate office of mine to make sure the same thing. And she straight up told me that the amounts I was moving wasn't a concern. (we are talking up to a few thousand dollars a time, and cash deposits in that amount.) 
**Edit:** as pointed out below there isn't an issue with coinbase, I miss read the post. The problem is with other forms of currency exchanging, using a company that plays buy the rukes, like coinbase is the safe way to do it. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 17:36:38
If you just want to get a small amount to hold then Localbitcoins (Coinbase if you are in the US is an option) is the best.  If you want to place to trade them daily then an exchange is what you need, and that will depend on where you are.

First, you should probably read about each exchange and their policies before picking one.     
I suspect you decided on btc-e because of the low price and lack of registration, but there is a cost to doing business with the last exchange hiding in the shadows.    
Anyhow, you should be able to withdraw the funds in crypto if you have more than 0.011btc or 1.1ltc, if not the funds are stuck.

Btc-e is $320 (but old world banks gonna take their skim, to the tune of 5%,), with a real cost of $337.   
Now coinbase is at $342 (but they take 1% + 15cent) giving a real price of $339   
$339-$337 = $2 (again not counting tx and withdraw fees from btce) 


It is not worth the trouble unless you are moving a couple hundred btc. 
@_date: 2013-09-08 02:30:52
Once bitcoin is debasing the fiat enough for anyone to notice they'll be more than a few asic manufacturers. Even if the government/s tried to force a protocol change they can't. Every one else can just reject the new protocol, and that will cause a fork, and the government chain will die. 
Unless you think the government is going to physically update everyone's clients for them? That's the point of the decentralized aspect, no one can force a change onto the system. 
Its only less of a problem for scrypt mining because there is no incentive to build application specific hardware for it, but i guarantee someone somewhere is working out designs just incase litecoin is ever profitable on its own, without being traded for btc. 
@_date: 2013-08-21 05:24:15

@_date: 2013-11-23 16:19:46
Yet it's never happened to me and I've had orders double in value.     
How does coinbase lose money? They pull your Bitcoins from the pool at the time you place the order, they are not waiting 4 days to buy the coins and then going "well shit the price has gone up, better cancel".     
They are fronting the cash for you, and if their **automated** system sends a warning they drop your order.    
How many of these posts end with coinbase honoring the price? Most from what I can tell. 
Coinbase gets thousands of orders a day, even more during market shifts.    
It's not surprising a handful fall through the cracks each day.

If you pay $2 for 2btc

Pay $2 for a miner that only makes 1btc before being useless,     
It doesn't matter what the price per bitcoin is you are never going to break even.

I presume you are using Coinbase? 
Just make sure you have a good password and 2 Factor Authorization.  Next don't be lazy, there is a button that says "authorize this computer for 30 days" don't do it, if your computer gets compromised then you effectively shut off 2FA, don't have your browser store your password either. 
There is no reason your coinbase account shouldn't be as secure as your standard bank account.

The problem is bitcoin (and the rest) lets everyone feel and behave like a stock trader.     
Anyone can attempt day trading, currency exchange, international money laundering (joking, but not really). 
So you end up with a lot of people who simply don't have the training, or education to function in such rolls.    
I find myself looking things up constantly, I'd never heard of a Fill or Kill order before I got involved in bitcoin. True a simple Google search and the testnet cleared that up quickly.   
As bitcoin becomes less technical, and accessible to the common man, that's exactly what you will find here:    
The Common Man.   Not just a room fully of computer science and economic professors (you know what I mean) anymore.

It sounds like you did no research, a search on "Bitcoin + Mining"  would bring up nothing but people saying "Don't do it".    
A search for the USB gizmos would have brought up charts showing how much money they lose unless they are free.     
And searching "how to buy" (presuming you did read the side bar) would have told you to make your first purchase cash from localbitcoins. 


But it's not the path most people took, everyone here was new at one point, but it seems like you didn't do any research before entering a new financial system. 


Not surprisingly, you made bad choices; and like most people you would rather blame someone, or something else that have to acknowledge it's your fault, not the systems.

Can you back up the private key, and import it into a wallet with no limits? 
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:22:36
The private key is what controls your coins.    
You can make your own wallet and send the bitcoins to it, and then you have to be responsible for security and back ups.   
Or you can let Coinbase worry about all that, as long as you use 2FA and keep your account information safe.

There is a difference between money and legal tender. 
United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.—[31 U.S.C. § 5103](

Coinbase doesn't work the way Gox does it's not an exchange it's a store. 
And the only payment option is bank transfer. 
When you place an order they will hold btc for you at that price until your payment clears.  You won't see anything on your end before you agree, afterwards there will be a pending balance until it clears,  4 business days (but I've had several clear in 2)


Coinbase is playing nice with rules, this will require you to verify your identity to some degree, what you may be looking for is localbitcoins.

why is it that people who speak the way you do are always the ones calling others "children" and "complete dickwad"?   
Seems humorous to me, I wounder if you are this bold in real life or just when you can hide behind your computer.  
We disagree, not that big of a deal (well it seems to be to you), So I have a higher standard of proof before I run around calling people names on a strangers behalf, you don't and that's great; I'm sure there is no shortage of people needed you to come to their rescue when they've done something stupid and want to blame someone else.     
People like you and the poster refuse to accept responcibility for your choices, its easier for you to blame the service, blame the thief, but you never seem to get around to looking to see what you did wrong; you just want to call other people dickwads.

We need to abandon this diminishing metric lable system, and just jump to the end of the line and work our way up with metric lables everyone uses on a daily bases.    
1 bitcoin = btc, Bitcoin, or Full Bit   
0.00000001 Bitcoin = bit.    
From there just apply the increasing metric lables. And this problem is permanently solved, because in a year or two people will just have to figure out what to use next.   
The obsession with new symbols and custom names for each diminished tier of btc is confusing and distracting.

Here is my last [post](  on the topic. 
I use blockchain.info wallet as my day to day, it's got nice features and sycs with my desktop. Now it is a hosted wallet, but with a secure password and 2FA I'm not that worried, but i don't keep a ton in it. This is also the account I use for coinbase and Btc-e, basically my traceable btc. 
 The schildbach on the other hand is my "other" account, it's a nonhosted and very reliable.

~~well "I sent that amount to this individual" and I'll pull out my records and provide the date and time, the cell or email whatever it may be.~~ 
"I need to speak to a lawyer" 
**EDIT** In all honestly, if you're that worried about it why not keep a mobile wallet like schildbach's and do the following as an example:
Coinbase -&gt; to new schildbach address -&gt; to client. 
Thats acceptable just to protect you from them, since coinbase creates a new address for all outgoing transactions. But there is no reason to potentially conspire when you can just add that step yourself.

But you could have used a more fluid exchange and over the next 4 moths made trades, earning more then 12% over all. Meanwhile you had access to your funds at a moments notice.

Basically yes to all of your questions.  
If you can sell them all in one lump sum you don't have any issues (other than taxes, and questions from your bank if it's over 10k, or significantly more than you normally deposit), but if you're going to do it more then once, then the general concensus is you have to register as a money service business, comply will all know your client, and anti-money laundering regulations and pay taxes. 
Depending on your bank you need a business account. Or use a credit union, they have some different rules. Make sure it's a checking account not a savings account.

Couple reasons:    
* the price on an exchange doesn't account for the fees of getting your money to said exchange, so someone flipping bitcoin has to take that into account.    
* you have to pay for their own convenience of not using an exchange, not registering your purchases.    
* and the seller wants some profit.

It depends on the market, if its a couple dollars different I normally don't make an issue out of it.     
But I've had the price change $60/btc over night.
I try to use localbitcoin wallets as much as I can, just because you get the confirmed transaction, which makes you more attractive to other buyers.

What's odd is they claim to have paid out $456,469.00 and have 137,928 members.    
Now that's $3.31 each, but the front page claims you can make $10 in 30seconds, something doesn't add up.   
There is also a $300 minimum for payout,  so taking the total amount paid out, that would mean about 1% of their members have been paid.

I'm going to assume you are not taking me for a ride and try to explain how this work.      
If you had 2 ounces of gold, you got one ounce for $1 and the other for  $5.   When you go to sell an ounce for $7, does it matter which one you sell?    
No both are identical and worth exactly the same amount.       
The same is true with bitcoins.  You have 2 bitcoins, and you've spent $X acquiring them, and they are currently worth $1378, $689 each.   Every bitcoin is identical, the price you paid for each one is irrelevant to the system because that value is only known to you.

Agreed, when the price jumped this last time I got a lot fewer emails from localbitcoins/craigslist. But this last week I've been getting contacted once or twice a day.     
Every single one of them has been a new buyer, who didn't mind paying for the face to face start, getting questions answered, heck a couple of then didn't even have wallets or any idea what the we're doing.    
The funniest one was a guy who didn't have a smart phone or laptop, logged into his blockchain account from my phone to get his address, because he didn't realize they were Case sensitive, and wrote down all caps to make it easy to read.        
That was a long talk about security, and he was buying several btc.

There are some systems that would allow this, and I've always wanted to support a coin that processed data for SETI or the LHC.    
The problem is verifying the data is real and not a pile of junk.    
Bitcoin mining is hard to do, but easy to check.    
Compiling LHC data is easy (if I make shit up), but very had to double check. 
So you need a way for the computers to prove that validity of the information they send back.

The problem with PayPal is this    
* they refuse to recognize digital content as "goods" so the buyer can claim that you didn't ship a physical item and get a forced refund for up to 45days.     
* as with any credit card you can call the bank and issue a merchant chargeback for up to  180 days after the tx.   PayPal doesn't fight these, so that seller gets shafted. 
Basically there is a reason you can't buy a few thousand dollars worth of btc with credit or paypal, it's not secure for the seller.

For the record I use coinbase a lot. 
The problem with any hosted service is that if something catastrophic happens you may not be reimbursed. 
Coinbase keeps a percentage of all deposits in cold storage, do you know which employees have access to it? How secure is the physical security around it? If a disgruntled employee steals it and the hot wallet,  the company may file for bankruptcy and you get nothing.   
If just a small number of accounts are compromised then they or any big host could cover the loss, but it's generally not considered worth the risk.  Why let someone else host them when you can create an encrypted USBs to hold the private key. 
Even if someone steals my usb, I'm certain I can get the spare, and move the coins before they break the encryption.

@_date: 2013-12-09 22:31:19
Remember when credit cards were rare, and invitation only to the rich.    
Wasn't cheap then, was it?    
My point is that as bitcoin usage grows the cost goes down, and will fall well below the costs of the above companies.   
This post isn't claiming there are more safety nets in credit cards; it's claiming there is no way bitcoin could ever compete from an operating cost standpoint. And that's not true.    
If you want to start a post about theft safety nets and the lack there of for bitcoin I will join you there, because it is an issue. But the cost effectiveness isn't.

This wouldn't help spread out the mining for two reasons.     
1 -  Your video card would still have to compete with ASIC arrays that would dominate it hash wise.      
with the large-scale arrays taking the largest portion of the hash, they would take a large portion of the payouts, leaving your small-scale rig unprofitable.        
2 -  once your unprofitable rigs gets shuts off, the mining falls back into the hands a growing minority. 
Unless you somehow capped rewardable contributions, the people with the best tech will do all the mining from now on.

You should be able to goto settings, battery and see a list of what is using your battery. for me its Screen 85%.  Not exact but usefull for seeing a usage spike.
As far as data, do the same thing, settings data usage. When first updating the blockchain it uses a fair amount, but its not hosted, so of course blockchain will kill it there, However over hte last month Schildbach has used 4.8 and Blockchain has used 3.2 MB so not a big difference.

The government can't effectively regulate buildings or banks, how one earth do you think they will regulate "unregistered" addresses?      
Mycelium already supports read only bip38 address loading from QR, so I could store the encrypted private key practically anywhere, load it to the app, send from it, wipe the app, load a reg address, and there would be no trace I used the "dirty" address.     
How would that government seize the funds without the private keys? 
This would be less effective than prohibition was.

I tested them a while back.    
First, that can't reuse username was supposed to be fixed, looks like they didn't update their email.    I get a couple of those emails, as I ended up with a couple of accounts during the beta, keep forgetting to close the extra ones, but curious how long it takes for them to do it. 
Second, they are not a traditional online wallet.   They are a "cryptocurrency bank", and as such have account fees and everything you've grown to love from a standard bank.   These fees are what allow then to operate the way they do.     
**Edit** I am in no way implying the fees are unjust, running a bank is expensive. 
Third, the debit cards work on a closed system, so they are only good at sites that have one of their acceptors.    
While awesome, it is limited, so don't expect to stroll in to McDonald's and slap it down on the counter.    
If a uniformed system for processing bitcoin debits is implemented and you can get the software rolled out to businesses, there is no technological reason a bitcoin debit card couldn't work anywhere which takes Visa its just getting the routing software into the companies POS and network.      
Coinkite will be on the front lines of that fight.

I think you are making it more complicated then it needs to be, I explain it to people as a "Wallet" is an "Account Number", and that seems to help. Not keeping loads of btc in an online wallet is good advice, but the business will be cashing them out not holding them, so thats not really an issue.  
As I understand your situation there is no reason go go into paper wallets or anything. As a payment system, all he/she needs is a Coinbase Account, and they are done. All they **NEED** to understand is people will pay them and Coinbase will convert it into USD for free.


Coinbase will do and provide all of that.

Not really, as demand rises on Coinbase their price does rise ahead of bitstamps


No you can't, Coinbase is a store not an exchange. You buy what they are selling or you buy someplace else.    
The reason Coinbase is doing so well is that they made it easy for Americans to get bitcoin.  It can be hard to get money into exchanges, and even harder to get it out. 


This has to do with the ease of moving funds in and out of the exchange, and thr volume on the exchange. For example you can't get your USD out of GOX so the price went way up, as people wanted a premium due to the gamble/6 month wait to get funds.

Coinkite, has an account verification image that is static.    
I'd like to see a reverse 2FA:
Basically when I open my app, I select an account, coinbase in this case,     
And it displays two ever changing, random codes.     
A site verification code       
And a user verification code.    
But the pictures are a step in the right direction. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:09:59
I'm not sure I follow.      
It takes the banks that long to agree on  ACH transfers, and for the government to decide to let you spend your money.     
Bitcoin tx are instant, and not subject to an approving body.       
Why fault coinbase for making sure they don't get screwed by the banks? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:42:02

Just because the money was in the account doesn't mean there wasn't an issue with your bank.    
I know coinbase bashing is the "In" thing, but have you called you bank to inquire what (if any) issue they had with the request.

What this is, is a misunderstanding of how the system works.    You never had any bitcoins, you had an IOU from MtGox for bitcoins.

 The cost of running bitcoin network is tied to the mining directly.    
As that cost goes down and usages goes up the cost per transaction gets smaller.    
So what do you mean it's irrelevant?    
All the credit card companies have a cost per transaction, which is seemly unknown to you. 


Yes it does, and you still haven't corrected your post from the archaic power consumption numbers you used. 


I'm sure they've thought of that, which I why I used their profit sheets. 
Again there are the hidden costs, the fees AXP charges vendors is over $3 million a day, so you need to add that cost. And bitcoin has tx fees too, let's add those.

Most likely yes, since you had a online wallet. 
Before you had a hosted wallet, you changed to a local wallet. Both were online because they were on machines connected to the internet. 
To prevent this use an actual offline wallet. If you keep using an online wallet, you need better password, because if you truly have no malware/virus then you had a crap password, or used the same password for more then one thing. 
Since its gone anyhow, please share your password with the group so they can better explain to you why it wasn't

Write it down, but print the QR the seller would rather scan it than type your address in, those things are long and I'm lazy
Do you have an android phone? If so install the coinbase app, and you can have the address and QR code, as well as it will tell you when the transaction is initiated.
You can run a search on an address with blockchain.info so you can watch just your address. There is a search box on the front page. 
If you want to be extra safe, make the seller agree to hang out for 2 confirmations.

Let me know if they pay out on that $10 spike. Eventually they are going to have to provide more information on this metric, but i stand by my personal experience that I bought during a glitch (no way around that) at 96, and a week later when it posted it was at 112.

Tru dat. Those numbers should definitely be removed. What about day traders on Btc-e (and others), those should be removed. What about people that send from one site, like Coinbase, to an account, then to SR? that's the same coin same person inflating the block, pull all those too.

First:  What payment strive are you using to accept btc. You should be using a service like Coinbase, which is free (for your first million dollars) and can convert to USD instantly. This would solve the problem from the start. 
Second: if you had a price of $140 you were looking at MtGox which you shouldn't have been doing anyway. 
Third: These fluctuations are normal right now, the price shot up a week ago and is coming back down now. Which is why you should not hold btc you don't want to risk. 
In closing if you need the funds right now, then you should have sold immediately upon getting paid, if you held them hoping to make more, well this is a market. What were you doing holding onto btc without knowing the risks? 
 It will go back up but it won't be overnight.

Thats why I don't understand why sites that have authentication don't display an authentication code on the login, that you can match on your end, that would prove false site immediately.     
Then only malware and man in the middle attacks are left, and malware is generally to slow to capture and use 2FA,  and from what I understand it's very unlikely that a MITN attack would be successful because of the time constraints.

. . .  I suppose, but if you buy "at a crash"  on coinbase why not just sell it on coinbase after the market recovers?    
Why send it to btc-e, why "fuck around" on the market?     
The fact that you don't know what transfer, withdrawal, and exchange fees you are going to have pay only reaffirms my previous statement:     
Maybe you should do the math on this first, because it's just not there.

Fast transactions are at concession stands, and places.   
It's not cost effective to cheat a $5 sale.

I've found a way to add a pvt key, and add an address, but no way to have 1 private key with 3 addresses. 
I need to read through a faq if they have one.

Now this is just getting out of control.

You could, you could also use the same password for everything and not bother with 2FA.     
But it's smarter to just nothing give its out in the first place.

The average machine can, the average person can not without learning.    
People don't inherently knkw how to secure cash, it was a learned skill.   
People will have to learn this too, but luckily for then places like coinbase, are at least providing a safe place for people to store btc while they learn.    
In all honesty know one forced you to buy btc, no one forced you to use a fraudulent OS, you ultimately you decided to be loose with your security.

**DO NOT FOLLOW THIS ADVICE**
Do not ask your customers where you are sending the money, plausible deny ability is your friend here. Just assume it's to a cold storage account as an investment. Legally can't engage in business with this/these people
Under US Law you can not exchange currency for someone if you suspect it will used in the commission of a crime (buy narcotics counts) this is a felony for you. 
Under US Law the above listed advice get you the following charges minimum: Money laundering, drug trafficking, and conspiracy to commit a felony, in addition to any other charges this person may be subject to you ~~will~~ may be subject to under your conspiracy charge.

You're better off just buying bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:19:42
Localbitcoins, cash, face to face     
Bitcoins and credit cards don't mix well, one is slow, prone to fraud, takes forever to post, and high in fees; the other is cheap, basically instant, and practically fraud proof.

Yes if you have a tens of thousands dollar rig and reinvest at least 50% of the generated btc into keeping it competitive. 
Short answer: NO.

I'm sure that can be googled, but do you have any evidence that Coinbase is operating in some sort of illegal manor? 
@_date: 2013-09-03 03:29:50
Yeah but coinbase and blockchain.info have apps, so it's not like you are keeping coins "someplace else" just an easier to use way via phone.

You want contact info for an exchange that hasn't declared an address, which the owners are unknown, and is presumably ran from Russia?

Not exactly, if I'm a service/commodity provider and I clearly state no cash, and you engage in commerce with me then try to pay cash, you are breaking the agreed upon contract. A court would have to award me debt. 
Its stupid to think people don't take cash but it's fairly common, mostly for security reasons.

Just because people want one, I'd buy one for a couple bucks, for absolutely no reason then it's just a cup of coffee. 
Now the people selling/buying them on ebay for $30+ who the hell knows, must be people that can't count, or think "well if the value of btc goes up I'll come out ahead", The Miner's Fallacy.

I can assure you that regardless of whether or not there is a sign that says "Visa? We need to add another 5% to your transaction", that the cost of credit payment systems is factored into the price at major retailers.  
You think Wal-mart is just footing the bill for you, no they just raise the price of the goods a few cents, charge everyone, and no one notices.
Hell, most people pay a service or account fee for their credit cards or bank accounts, so whats the difference?
