The [ASICMiner Block Erupters.]( They're actually pretty cheap right now. But you probably will never see any return on them because the mining difficulty is so incredibly high right now. 
It's just a hobby of mine... One of my many, incomplete hobbies...

Maybe I'll finally get to mine something!

Time for my Satoshis to skyrocket! 
@_date: 2014-08-01 17:43:03
1500-2000ish... But I don't really see the price getting to be that high. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 01:07:57
This is truly amazing...

Give me bits, and I will post a video of me dancing.

Well, with my Raspberry Pi, I'm running PiMiner on my Pi with a couple USB ASICs on a  powered USB hub.

You can't tell me what to do!
But I guess beggers can't be choosers...

But that other guy said to not to!

That, and I really liked her in, uhh... Rat Race?
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:42:48
A lot. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 05:09:23
I acutally upgraded and it looks so much worse now... Lol
@_date: 2014-02-13 02:18:54
I was making a joke &lt;_&lt;
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:44:53
What the fuck.

Yeah, each of these mothers does almost as much as my 7970 o_o

Ohh, jeez, you can buy the Bitmain Antminer [here](
The smaller ones in between the Antminers are [these]( but for $10 more, you can get like 5 times the Mh/s with the Antminers. The Antminers are a lot more worth it; I just wanted something to fill in my empty spaces.
The cooling fan is [this]( but I've got a bigger clamp fan blowing on it so the whole rig doesn't burn my house down. Though, I haven't had much problem with heat. The cooling fan does enough to keep them cool, but when I had no cooling fan, it was hot enough to burn my skin and I found that out the hard way. The clamp fan is just there for insurance.
The Pi  is gonna need a 4GB SD card, so make sure you've got a reader for that.
And you're correct. This is the least profitable thing you can do, my setup cost me roughly $150 a month and a half ago, and they've made me $2 worth of Bitcoins (.004 Bitcoin) that haven't even been transferred to me because Slush's pool send threshold is .01 Bitcoin. Though, the whole setup barely puts any strain on my electric bill.
It was fun putting it together and making it work, and it's a great conversation starter, but it has yet to prove me any monetary worth at all.  Maybe I can buy something cheap on Overstock in a couple months, or I'll get really really lucky and mine a block.

I'll leave the mining to the Raspberry Pi. 
Heh heh.

I buy RAM from you. Is good quality RAM.

Don't let see this. They inherently hate Invicta, Swiss Legend, and Stuhrling Original watches.
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:07:49
I'd love it if my ol' 7970 could mine like the pros, although, I'm pretty good at mining Dogecoins...
@_date: 2014-05-18 17:33:57
*This* is actually good news. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 04:04:30
I see he is on steam. He should add me on steam. I am tmotom on there, too. 
And also you, addm3plz. I'll never add you. *You* must add *me*.

I'll crap if I get some Bitcoins.
