I though about it, could be indeed related but if that's the case then they should inform me instead of ignoring me. Also, if it's indeed related to bitfinex and they knew about it, they should have send a notice of their website / email not to use deposit addresses..
I don't think the way they are handling the issue is right, 0.05 btc is not much, but until this is fixed I avoid and suggest avoiding anything related or advertised on bitcoin.com

I've been using WeSellCryptos for a while now and never had any issue, it's a great service if you are willing to pay the extra fee.

Earlier today I was able to withdraw my balance from casino.bitcoin.com! No communication whatsoever but the withdrawal issue is fixed.

I still can't get over his tweet following the visit. "My talk at the CIA went well today. The hallways there are REALLY wide, and full of interesting stuff."

I couldn't agree more, I have been using their platform for more than 2 years and never had a single problem.

Unfortunately he never sent you the amount.
He imported an address to your wallet for you to keep track of but without the private key of that address you can't transfer the coins. It's a known scam.

You are right, the tool linked previously was made for v2. I meant to link btcrecover, which is compatible with v3.

Here's a quick perl script that will generate all of the possibilities, then invoke any windows command (like bitcoin-cli  importprivkey $key) and make it run until the wallet has been imported. Can be run on windows.
$db = "allvalidcharacters";
 = split('',$privatekey_wif);
 = split('',$db);
$length = length($privatekey_wif);
for ($position = 0; $position &lt; $length+5; $position++)
	foreach(
	{
		 = 
		splice( $position, 0, $_);
		print join('',
	}

Seems to be AlphaBay related.

Your best bet is to either find a multibit installer, install the wallet and import the wallet.aes.json file in it.
~~You other option is to decrypt the file using this tool, you will be provided with the priv key and will be able to import / sweep it.

Localbitcoins / paxful is probably your best option... however if you happen to live in canada you can use mybtc.ca
I've used mybtc.ca multiple times and never had an issue.

I just paid for an ad and it got activated the second the transaction reached 2 confirmations. Website has a nice feel to it and the interface is, in my opinion, perfect. 
Will probably use it on a regular basis!
@_date: 2019-04-10 20:01:33
More like 5$
@_date: 2016-09-17 20:23:16
No, I tried anything from 0.005 to 5 btc, my account is probably flagged for no withdrawals.

Depending on the outcome of the new development (They made an exception and no longer require my credit card as they verified it was prepaid), this will indeed be the next step.
@_date: 2016-09-18 19:44:08
UPDATE 1: I have received an email stating that they have verified that indeed they were prepaid cards and now i'm asked to send ID, which I uploaded on BitStarz. The previous messages from BitStarz stated that as soon as the credit card was verified my withdrawal would be processed, no ID or anything else needed. Anyways, I will update this message and provide txid upon payment.
"Hi Alexandre
I am writing here to inform you that we have checked with out payment provider and can confirm that the cards that you have used to deposit here with us where indeed prepaid cards, and since it was quite some time ago they where used we will make an exception on them, so these do not have to be verified.
The bill and the bank statement that you sent in where approved, there was just one document that we had not received and this was one of your passport or driving licence, this is the last piece we would need now in order to verify you account and approve your withdrawals.
It has been a curvy road but we are coming to an end, when this has been verified, you will not have to verify the same thing again, and a withdrawal usually takes only 10 minutes to get approved at this point.
If you have any questions at all regarding this, let me know straight away.
Best regards"

You make it sound so easy, I switched bank account since then and it could also been from prepaid credit cards or even from e-coin.io. i really don't keep track of all my transactions especially from old bank accounts or prepaid cards.
Anyways, everyone here including yourself know I won't see any of these bitcoins, I was even ready to receive only part of the winnings to avoid all of this but I can assure you that I will make sure that the word is out and that hopefully it will save a few users from depositing. In the long run, i'm confident that you will be losing more than 5 btc.
Once again, even tho i probably shouldn't, I'm willing to negociate a deal and partial payout from the casino and remove all of the details tegarding my case.
Wouldn't it be the minimum to at least refund the 0.4 or 0.5 that was deposited and used prior to the winnings?
If so, I will list the deposits (3 or 4 txid totaling 0.4 or 0.5 btc) once i'm home

I submitted a report on askgamblers.com, will also report on gamblinggrumbles.com . Thanks!
@_date: 2016-09-18 22:05:21
I was paid in full following the submission of my proof of ID. 
I always have been a fan of BitStarz and despite the incident of the last 24 hours, I would recommend it to everyone.
I also want to thank everyone that helped me, your replies on reddit and private messages were extremelly appreciated. I was made aware earliet today that a few users contacted BitStarz regarding my withdrawal. Thank you very much! The bitcoin community amazes me.

I know I won't get my 5 btc paid, and if I only I knew I wouldnt have played for years hoping for a win that wouldn't be paid anyways.
Ive submitted complains to a few medias and casino website and i'm willing to take screenshots history and provide all informations to make sure that other players don't get fucked the same way I did.
It's so Ironic that I was such a good player that they would give me free spins, bonuses and promos for years and I kept spending bitcoins there hoping for a win...
The truth is out and in the long run im sure they'll lose more than 5 btc
@_date: 2016-09-18 08:16:28
Not that it does any difference but none of my cards are stolen or anything fraudulant.
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:34:46
Simply import or sweep the private key in Electrum. If you rather use an online service, block.io will do the trick.

I would like to apologize on behalf of all Canadians. Sorry!

Vitalik Buterin is born on January 31 1994. Satoshi first post was in 2008, which would make Vitalik 14 years old at that time.
