in their eyes you are supporting a competing form of business.  That level of reaction though just shows you how powerful crypto is becoming

I want to start mining for BTC to learn the process because I am a nerd. What are my options these days?
@_date: 2019-07-18 13:09:52
This is not to make money. It’s to understand the process. I’m talking about doing this from scratch on a spare box.
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:24:20
if your money is on exchange with your KYC, they know already
@_date: 2019-07-24 11:20:39
Do you know how fast that backdoor would make it into the wild or some hacker to reverse engineer it? No time at all. This is fucking stupid on so many levels. This moron has to go.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:25:49
glad to hear someone being rational for once.  THERE IS NO SHAME IN TAKING  PROFIT

Shitcoin hoarder trying to get some of those losses back
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:55:35
Well. Shit. More proof I’m in over my head. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:06:13
I understand the implications which is keeping me in for long haul. I have diversified into other coins as well. I’m more or less just whining. I have not overextended myself and can afford to lose all of his money but I believe in the future of crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:54:35
If the predictions are true and you’re here just to make money and not to try and change the world with a new type of currency, then I would set a limit sell at $X and go live your life. This is starting to take over my life!
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:51:04
I agree that crypto cannot be stopped, but if Trump or someone in those upper level positions starts to question crypto openly, the price may dip. I would just like to know how these people stand (if anyone knows).
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:41:44
Heh, I bought at the dip!  It was $15,800!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:22:24
yep, I've been waiting for a dip for days now and hasn't happened.  feeling like a dick at the moment 
@_date: 2018-09-19 14:12:37
which one of you is going to buy a beat up '76 Pinto and put HODL on it?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:39:20
It’s not coinbase, they are waiting for your wire. It’s your bank. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:55:09
Now that is weird. Hope it goes through today!  
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:02:31
I wouldn’t worry. I think BTC will go through insane spikes. Set a stupid-low limit buy once the funds come through. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:23:55
No, next business day
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:44:51
Because Monday starts somewhere in the world earlier than where you live
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:43:42
Amen brother. I’m the person everyone else is making money off of. I’m going into ticker silence.

that was it?

Find good, dependable, trustworthy developers and promise them good money. Then ask what they want to use.
@_date: 2019-03-30 14:13:17
Seems legit

@_date: 2018-10-15 16:48:13
what do you recommend 
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:53:07
insiders know SN's identity, but one of Bitcoin's prized possessions is that there is no single person at the helm who can dump the price if he gets caught cheating on his wife or busted with a DUI.  Let the secret live on for the sake of Bitcoin itself.

Hers what I know: 1) the IRS said all trades are taxable. 2) they do not have a sense of humor

The reason so many people see it coming back in summer is this prediction which mirrors the 2013 bitcoin bubble crash and resurgence. There was an initial run up, then fall, then a major skyrocket. That’s what they are seeing - a repeat of that bubble. I have copied that bubble onto the graph now and it matches. May not mean shit but for 11 months now it’s been almost perfect. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:07:17
I traced this bubble onto 2013 bubble. Might be helpful.  
@_date: 2019-01-25 20:38:37
What payment system?
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:58:08
a decentralized coin would directly compete with Mastercard, this is not news 
@_date: 2019-01-12 23:19:31
looks good.  Vuetify?
@_date: 2019-01-30 18:59:54
isn't that like *all* of the ETH now?
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:33:07
say what you will about charts but this guy has a 12 month streak fitting his prediction to the actual price fairly accurately.  I can see BTC at $40-$100K by end of 2019 or 2020 for sure
@_date: 2019-01-11 02:00:36
yes, because the algorithm would have to be cracked in the interval between blocks being created - it's not like the QCs would be able to idle away at the problem with unlimited time.
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:45:10
Your stat is from the past. This is different this year. IRS has already put out bulletins. If you use Coinbase, they will know who to ensure has paid crypto taxes. I would file something.  Make a “best faith” effort. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:43:30
My guess is this is a small bull trap. Headed to low 5s. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:58:52
Not in my opinion. This is a bull trap, selling will commence soon for US taxes. Will fall to 6 or below.

Dimebag started a bank (!?!?!)

Just get a wallet, anywhere. Print the QR code for the public address.  Post it near your checkout area or have it laminated and ready to show someone who's checking out.  You can verify the payment and then mark it paid. THat's true peer to peer.
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:41:01
'downturn'? you're too kind 
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:52:40
And when his that?
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:09:32
I used to think that too but this time we have half the world that at least has heard about bitcoin or crypto.  The entire continent of Africa is using crypto. There is much, much more interest and knowledge of the product now than in 2013. The bubble crash will not follow as low or as long as the last one which is why it’s happening much faster thus time. Also, the hodlers will simply never sell. I would not wait until sub-3. 5,800 perhaps but I think we are close to bottom within 30-60 days. 
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:21:55
Who’s gonna tell him?
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:17:32
wait a bit
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:37:34
you will not get a tax break if you don't sell though. The article says you can sell and buy right back (wash trading)
