Can you elaborate why it's impossible to phase out cash cotton money ?
@_date: 2019-11-24 13:06:36
Have you ever checked your BTC address balance? ... If you did without using vpn then they could track you looking up your transaction ID or address
@_date: 2019-11-28 07:10:19
It's actually bit scary, cotton money gives you some level of anonymity. So going fully digital and soon banning cotton money is a Orwell's1984 world.

You are right , that is cash advantage. However if let's say they simply transition to cashless system there isn't much you could do, except BTC that is or gold (maybe)

I'm very curious too , to see sub 1 btc mining reward in 2032. Great times ahead!
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:25:32
Whatever majority decides on that what becomes bitcoin,rest will be a fork. But yes both will exist and people decide which one will be used , and value will be kept with one that has bigger audience.
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:29:37
Sure you can ,but it will not make it The Bitcoin. It will be a copy or a fork (bch and bsv) that no one really cares for.
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:40:54
Indeed it's divisible! And that means it's scalable, however that doesn't change the consensus of the whole Network, keeping 21,000,000 bitcoin ever to exist. With many bitcoins being lost , estimated 4mil so far, it's only getting more and more scarce.

I think he means bias...
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:04:47
It's bad if you apply same system strategy and chose instant gratification , and chosing wrong time preference. If I save , any amount will be worth way more than at time of saving and that very same car as per your example will be cheaper in future. so buying in future with today's saving basically.. instead of ever decreasing purchasing power and increasing prices.

Actually, tbh I think the guy is doing exactly what everyone else but without direct promises of utility. He just made a coin that isn't any different from any other and proving everyone that just anything can be hyped into a successful project ... It's kind of hilarious. Maybe a genius proof of people's gullibility ?
I'm just gonna get my popcorn and watch

Unfortunately no, take it as a paid course you have learned something from this.
@_date: 2019-12-25 17:09:24
We had $20-$40 fees not because the price was 20k, dig into that further ;)
@_date: 2019-12-20 19:49:35
Just generalizing anything that's not BTC that's all no hard feelings for any hard working developers.
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:26:28
And that's your opinion , you are to eligible to have one even if it's absolutely incorrect one. Have a good day !
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:03:17
And that's okay ,you are free to support whatever one likes ! Any fork or non fork whatever makes you happy
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:14:34
There is 100,000,000 satoshi but it would be fairly easy to add a zero or two or hundred,it wouldn't change the price of BTC or of 1 Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-12-10 16:23:57
Damn ... I want some *drools*. Maybe I should have been more specific when it comes to trading value rather sentimental! Wish you great apple turnover this year
@_date: 2019-12-20 12:10:44
Really? Source
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:17:39
Bitcoin is said to be the most scarce item ,or whatever you want to call it, in existence of our known world.
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:33:29
But why would it go back to ~4mb after 4 years let's say ...
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:21:09
It's alright we all learn something new everyday, and that not everyone has the same knowledge or perspective.

I've been doing a lot of research on BTC power consumption and how miners look for cheapest source of energy, especially in areas that have surplus. It's more likely they will keep mining, and it will be all profitable   
 due to ever rising BTC price / demand and that within 10 years renewable energy will be cheaper and more accessible. 
but thats my 2 sats.
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:18:13
I think you are just being very picky and literal. Near infinite? Would that work for you ?
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:34:22
But wouldn't that kill the miners ? I'm just being curious
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:26:37
Yes exactly, that energy produced is not utilized for it's best efficiency... Just hook up miner and you get some profit back from unused energy and you are supporting this secure monstrosity :p
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:53:48
It shouldn't be an issue to divide 1 Satoshi further in addition to prices of transactions BTC is more of settlement network and layer 2 or 3 will handle cheap transfers for macro and mircro transactions. So the only issue is limits of our creativity.
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:21:52
You like totally missed the point, some people might notice this stamp and actually research Bitcoin even if it's 1 person out of a million it's a 1 person awaken.
@_date: 2019-12-20 12:20:39
@_date: 2019-12-28 22:48:41
Won't spark anything, it might after but not during. People don't understand that fiat is useless
@_date: 2019-12-20 20:35:15
So it's like 1st block had to be premined that can't be moved and it was assigned 50 BTC reward so if can keep on going...
@_date: 2019-12-20 19:31:09
Lol.. but I'm talking about btc not shit coins.
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:08:24
It's about it's finite amount, even gold has huge reserves underground and in space that it's just difficult to extract at this particular time. Bitcoin is solid, one of a kind, unique, maybe like a Mona Lisa ? That is just abstract , but no matter what you do {copy, or try to duplicate BTC or create new one or better one ) it's not bitcoin if it's not bitcoin and has limited supply.
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:24:11
Just to add , you are free to change anything but doesn't mean it will be still bitcoin ( bch , btsv) . The majority decides what is bitcoin, no matter the change.
