I tried to register  and got this:
"This OneName username is reserved for Satoshi Nakamoto. If this is you, please email reservations to claim it for free." 
How will you verify him? :-)

I am suprised so few people signed the petition given how perfect match bitcoin and avaaz are.

You are correct in saying Bitcoin doesn't need PayPal. I expect PayPal WILL adopt Bitcoin anyway as they don't have anything to loose by it and much money to make via it. 
However I would argue that when PayPal adopts bitcoin it will be a VERY big step forward for Bitcoin in gaining widespread acceptace.

I don't like how the site assumes I want to order supplies from them. Not really but kinda...
BitAddress.org seems better but I can't put BIP38 encryption if I provide my own private key...

15 GBP SEPA? You're being robbed in daylight ;-)
Come to Poland - it's free here :-)

PayPal - please pay no attention to this BitCoin (no pun intended). If you don't bring Bitcoin on board you will be obsolete in few years. I want you to be obsolete. 
I fucking hate PayPal both as a consumer and as a merchant..

Possibly Ukraine is too small of an econony and not bitcoin-ish enough to have any real impact itself.

40% of people here read the Satoshi witepaper? Wow! I graduated CS and I haven't read it in it's entirety. This suggests we have a very technical audience here... :-)

I was wandering about that myself and found no good anaswer anywhere. I was thinking make a brain wallet, than making a paper wallet (possibly with BIP38) out of it so that in case my paper gets stolen/burnt/etc I can still access my wallet as brain wallet.
However I found no place where I can put in my private key and get a nice printout from it ...

Complete with a UniCorn logo and hit-the-rock-with-hammer manual mining software. 
Professor Bitcorn would be proud ;-)

USA is a gigantic mess.. :/

It's not a big exchange (volume) but news of another exchange being hacked is most unseltling :/

 is another one great one that takes bitcoin too. It was first time I spent my BTC too :-).
Paying was such a breeze that I ended up paying a couple of times (the keep prolonging my service time) just to show my friends and colleagues how easy it is to pay with Bitcoin using a phone wallet :-)

It won't load as of this moment ... r/Bitcoin overload? :-)
