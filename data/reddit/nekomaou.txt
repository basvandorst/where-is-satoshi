Kudos also for him helping verify Monero source-code, a valuable individual to the crypto community.

I was going to post this... so many things needing funding and ppl go the trendiest friendly money-grabbing little scam out there.
OP I'm disappoint.

Bitcoin is not anonymous, and I can't believe you are comparing Bitcoin with guns, Bitcoin offers freedom for your wealth, guns only purpose are to create fear and to kill.
I'm against Dark Markets and transaction of illegal goods, but I can't stop them, I'm not god yet.
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:56:15
You fail to understand money and financial system are actually pretty complex, Bitcoin will be used everywhere and people wont even know it because it will be ubiquitous like internet itself, that i doubt 5% of people fully understands how it works.

You are right about Nirvana, at least thats how I see it. Good/evil does come from the same thing, that being actions, doesnt matter if mental or physical and they can be divided in actions that give good fruits and good fortune (dharma) and actions that bring suffering and leads us to a bad destinations (or bad karma). 
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:49:54
hope you bought some Moneros
@_date: 2014-09-03 20:10:40
Freedom from seizure, everything you described (taxes, laws, banks) perform direct or indirect seizures of all or part of your money, the hacker is nefarious, bitcoin is just the easier road to conduct transactions and it offer degrees of privacy. Dark markets exist with plain simple cash and has always existed and bitcoin has nothing to do with it, if I follow you version of reality we should be cutting off electricity and modern tecnology from everyone because its facilitating crime to some extent.
@_date: 2014-08-29 16:13:28
I dont find it funny
@_date: 2014-09-25 06:14:18
Land of the rising coin.
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:32:48
Like the roots of a lotus flower extend into the dirt mud and the stem grows up through the water and the flower blossoms above the surface, Bitcoin will boom in Argentina, Cyprus, China..
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:34:10
They will regret in 5 years, because Bitcoin is honest and at range of almost anyone that will regret in the future, a large majority.
@_date: 2014-09-02 10:48:04
Bitcoin is lifes cream.
@_date: 2014-08-29 19:43:08
now we just need the Bitcoin CEO to come here and clarify the other points...
@_date: 2014-08-29 16:57:12
oh, got it, thank you for clarifying that c:
@_date: 2014-08-28 08:46:30

@_date: 2014-08-29 13:32:20

@_date: 2014-09-02 12:14:53
The great white Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-08-30 07:31:02
sorry no disbelief, just a joke around the fact people think bitcoin has a ceo and is a company and an illustration about the power of the decentralized nature of it
@_date: 2014-09-26 12:04:42
How about you just buy some Moneros.
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:38:11
well, it still on early stage, let it go folks
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:27:18
This should be stick on the reddit for like a month!
@_date: 2014-08-31 18:24:09
I just hope for you sir keep being this awesome Bitcoin spokesman.
@_date: 2014-08-24 14:50:39
Time, patience and keeping yourself alive
@_date: 2014-08-29 14:17:44
I can't make sense of what you said, but I suggest you reading some texts about samsara and the circle of existences (Bhavacakra) based on the individual karma to have an idea of what i'm talking about, if you want.
@_date: 2014-08-29 16:16:05
edit: nvm
Monero forked from BCN a long time ago, XMR devs have even hired professional mathematicians, Bytecoin has nothing more to do with Monero, other than publishing the original Cryptonote client from which Monero inherited its Cryptonote powers.
@_date: 2014-09-26 12:01:17
Monero is BitTorrent, Bitcoin is BBS.
downvote if true.
@_date: 2014-08-29 13:16:46
I believe in the afterlife but not eternal afterlife, more like a continuous circle of existence like in Buddhism, still people are free to do their choices and as long no one is harmed I see no reason to react against, thats why I'm against other actions "socially accepted" today, like abortion.

fools, 4chen was handling them for free

@_date: 2014-10-17 01:22:29
This is really a cool story bro, and for you.
@_date: 2014-09-03 18:57:14
reason for 95% of the crying: you can't change bitcoin core settings now, its set in stone - satoshi
@_date: 2014-09-02 18:30:21

Ultimate indeed, but hah, not really anonymous.
