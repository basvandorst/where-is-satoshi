I use QuadrigaCX to buy bitcoin if I buy less than $3000, QuadrigaCX is a Canadian exchange. I recommend Copay bitcoin wallet to store your BTC.

Peter Shill is a moron when it comes to cryptos. Don't listen to him for crypto advice. He should stick to fiat currency.

If the money flows into it yes it could happen. Supply and demand buddy

Stop calling it a correction, it's the free market not a mechanical correction or some dumb shit term
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:55:00
It's not corrections it's people selling for less than it's worth
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:42:15
What about coinomi or electrum? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:01:42
We already have LN lined up

Bitfinex has always filled my orders fast.
It only once took 2min to fill an EOS order but XMR, LTC, ETC always fill in less than 15 sec
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:17:31
Sell in person... 
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:44:33
Worst exchange for liquidity is QuadrigaCX 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:21:20
Thanks but the STD's aren't worth it
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:11:34
Coinomi or Copay
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:10:30
$50,000 is the next goal
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:23:12

If you sell do it in person so tax department can't track you

I got banned from commenting on that sub reddit for suggesting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:40:15
I might get some Monero and bitcoin on top of eos. Those are my main coins at the moment 
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:46:36
Short answer, YES YOU SHOULD!
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:59:23
Litecoin is what I bought into as my alt coin 
@_date: 2017-07-16 04:10:12
Plus $800 is a lot to me
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:56:48
Not sure why bitpay is asking you to have at least 1BTC to send bitcoin, I use both Bitpay and Copay and haven't had this problem. Uninstall bitpay and down load it again try that
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:17:21
Bitcoin already passed moon phase, to Mars now!
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:07:05
If you live in the US Coinbase is sketchy, there are more rules from the US gov there on Bitcoin. Next time you buy use localbitcoins.com

August 1st... Hodl!
@_date: 2017-07-16 04:09:52
I was doing it on my phone and my data was slowed down because I already used my full cap. That's why it wouldn't redirect me. It's shoty when my carrier slows my data down. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:48:34
okay, I lost $800 in interac online because it never redirected the Quadriga's site after I signed into my bank. My bank told me to contact Quadriga because the bank has the $800 posted as a purchase and the money was taken out of my bank account.   
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:46:12
Download Copay and put in your wallet recovery phrase and try that
@_date: 2017-07-16 04:13:45
I'll honestly just call my banks dispute department on Monday when they open if QuadrigaCX doesn't get back to me
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:22:14
Copay is a Bitpay product, Bitpay helped pioneer bitcoin and is one of the biggest bitcoin companies. ITS SAFE! smh
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:51:51
The plan is if bitcoin forks into BTC and BCC you will have both but it doesn't mean both with be worth the same 
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:33:43
copay, bitpay, electrum
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:32:20
Most exchange sites will be fine, Coinbase, Bitstamp, ect.
I live in Canada and am not sure about QuadrigaCX yet, they haven't said anything on August 1st yet
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:51:09
also the money never went into my Quadriga CAD funds account
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:56:44
Same don't feel bad man 
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:39:50
Short answer, yes. But to be sure export your private key and don't lose your 12 word phrase 
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:21:46
Any mainstream wallet man, you really think companies like Bitpay, Blockchain aren't ready? There is being careful and than there is being paranoid. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:54:01
Stop predicting the price, you are misleading this guy with random price predictions  
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:56:27
Wallet settings, more options, export wallet
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:41:13
It's doing something now lol
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:51:11
I have that setting on and CoPay wallet on my phone said it had 3 confirmations in less than 15min 
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:46:55
I don't think buying bitcoins on Coinbase is bad but never hold your bitcoins in the Coinbase wallet. Use a private wallet only you have access to and the information like Copay, Bitpay, Electrum ect. Do your research man. Keep those coins safe
@_date: 2017-06-30 19:08:58
Copay, bitpay, electrum ect..
