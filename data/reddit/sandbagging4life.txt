Obviously. ;)
You people should really read about the history of financial bubbles. You'll realize that you're acting like suckers and hopefully save yourself some wealth.

Well, you're right on both counts that Bitcoins are worth the same now as three days ago and that there's needless sensationalism.
The trouble is that they're worth nothing and the only sensationalism is coming from people stupid enough to buy this stuff. It can only end in tears.

I'm not trying to be mean. The people who have bought in to this are just delusional.

I'm sorry for your inevitable loss of net worth. 
Best of luck to you.

I'm glad people are waking up from their delusional dreams. Not even a day ago I was warning people about this so-called currency and people were upset at me.
The world would be better off if everyone was required to read about the history of financial bubbles.

It's amusing how you ignore that prices declined to $60 in the interim. 
Just wait - eventually the world will run out of people willing to pay for Monopoly money, and the price will crash for good. I'm not going to forecast when that will happen, only that it will. You should read this book and count yourself lucky you have a chance to get out on an upswing.

Well, this must be fun for you.
