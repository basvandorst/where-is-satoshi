What's the best method to purchase in CAN?

Maybe a dumb question but.. As a man who cannot fork out $5500 for 1 bitcoin can I buy partial bitcoin. Like $2250 for .5bc?

Ya on a stock exchange can, i would be very surprised if anyone could call up their broker and short sell 10 bitcoins. Frankly even if you did short sell bitcoin on your own (sell now, repurchase at a lower price) you are just left with a "currency" hoping it rises in price again..

i was under the impression that the main functions of bitcoin were to store value, be used as a medium of exchange, and to facilitate comparison of value.
what else does it do?

Money: should have intrinsic value, should be recognized as legal tender, and remain relatively stable
Bitcoin: is accepted in some places, is not legal tender, and historically is very unstable.
This is a very odd currency you are putting your faith in. the barriers to entry in the crypto currency market are incredibly low, and based on technical analysis of bitcoin, all you need for its value to skyrocket proper marketing and relatively high demand. those are both very easy things to accomplish during our technological revolution.
as a speculative investor myself, id say that Pokemon cards can be more closely defined as money than bitcoin.
sorry to rain on the parade, a friendly argument is welcome from anyone

someone please explain to me how mining bitcoin creates value?

like exchanging large sums of money? without paying taxes? 
if thats what you mean it is as ethically wrong up as starting a non-profit to funnel money into a for profit firm.
what i'm saying is, if there is a will there is a way.. and there has always been a will to do that, so there are more ways than bitcoin... at some point there would be a paper trail like when it gets converted to cash, distributed among employees, or used to pay down debt.
