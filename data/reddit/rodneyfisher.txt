Guys who believe that BTC will change everything can wait for five years and then realize that they were stupid
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:52:02

I must to admit that your phrase "guy doesn't know what he is talking about" is right for 90% of all newspapers articles about bitcoin. Sad but true
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:54:41

And you can say that Bitcoin is a DIGITAL currency 
@_date: 2014-06-22 05:45:12
That's a nice way to take your attention.
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:57:34

But they are right, yeah?
I mean BTC has a value - it's true. but it's not a currency for now.
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:54:34
