Calling it a game doesn't make it less so. 
We could play the arson game where we see how many houses we can torch before getting caught. But it's ok! It's just a game!
The guy running ponzicoin is a genius. As someone else pointed out in that thread, all we really have in this life is our word (ie reputation) and by pulling the stunt that he did, he's able to gauge not only the community's reaction but also to build his own reputation by returning coins to those being the most vocal. This is only going to get people to trust more coins with him until he finally does decide to pull the plug and run.
I'll see you guys in 3 weeks when that happens.

I don't object to gambling. I object to the fact that so many people are saying this isn't a ponzi scheme and thus a reasonable way to "invest". I don't understand the delusion that because it's a "game" they should somehow expect it to be anything but a ponzi scheme. 
They were upset that the operator ran away with their coins for a short time, but if you're willing to put coins into something that labels itself a ponzi scheme you should expect that to occur. 
Plus, who's to say there isn't any deceit in this? How much transparency is there? Yes, you can see coins going in and out via the blockchain but who's to say who owns those wallets? How do you know the operator isn't the first one to put coins in each and every round? If people want to risk their coins, that's fine, that's for them to do. But to get upset when they lose them is just stupidity.
