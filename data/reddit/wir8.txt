THIS BITCOIN THING IS ALL OVER THE NEWS
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:31:36
Guess that's another altcoin.

I'm all in for the chickens. 
"Bitcoin has hit an ATH of 266 chickens and a drumstick"
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:05:25
That is already happening in where I live. Quite a lot of people recognize Bitcoin as terrorist money.
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:03:09
I actually find that comforting.

Time to goddamnit why didn't I sell my family into slavery to buy hard when it dipped to 1850
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:22:22
The hell happened to "best time to buy was yesterday..." thing?

Will you eat it live on tv though?

The "reeeee" gets me every time

Been using it since May. Great for convenience and I never heard anything scammy about them.
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:51:06
Last time I said that, I waited for a drop to 1700 and it jumped up after 1850. Still crying.

I use them as a miner as well so I'm not really sure but they have a pretty extensive "how it works" section somewhere in their website. AFAIK you choose the duration of your purchase like "I want X algorithm to be mined for Y amount of hashes for Z hours" and the amount you pay determines the priority of your order in the pool.

8.9? Where are you buying from? I use BTCTurk and the maximum fee is %0.40.
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:42:35
Yes it could have happened to anyone and it can still happen to anyone. That's why these people are always going around yelling "CONTROL YOUR PRIVATE KEYS".

Wrong sub, Google Nicehash, then go to r/nicehash

I'd probably put half of my savings in one and the rest in the other

Na man, I meant which website do you buy your coins from. I also live in Istanbul and buy with debit card as well. BTCTurk.com's fee is between %0.1-0.4 depending on the price.
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:03:55
I think I'm on the edge of becoming that guy. Was prepared to buy at 1700 and it didn't go lower than 1800 and I botched it :(

Losing the lottery?

Sadly, having a flatmate and slow-ass internet goes against the essence of owning the whole blockchain.
Maybe I can download the blockchain at work and bring it home...
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:57:48
Sounds like buying on the 21st to hold would be a fine gamble.
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:24:07
Oh that is immensely helpful, thank you. Also a question regarding that text: Instead of a hardware wallet, would an encrypted backup of a wallet file from Bitcoin Core or a seed backup from Electrum be enough? I'm kinda leaning on Electrum, or any other alternatives (if there are, ofc) that don't require the whole blockchain to be synced.

Wait a minute. What if both coins boom in say, 2 years? Will we basically have double the coin value? I mean, imagine I have 1 btc. after the fork I'm going to have 1 in both coins. One booms, I sell, the other booms, I sell again? I'm not really experienced but this sounds kinda weird to me.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:11:23
What is your casino's name going to be?
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:09:18
I feel you man, same speeds here. But I have 7.5 megabytes per second download/upload at work and read that I can just copy the files over to anywhere I want. So I'm going to try that tomorrow.

The price mostly. Thought about getting a Trezor but I'm just playing around with small amounts by getting around ~1.5-2 mBTC a day (cloud gpu hashing), so it feels kinda expensive to sink more than a month's profit into it if there is an alternate method. Especially when I've been doing this for roughly 2 months.
