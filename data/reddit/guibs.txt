By saying that you mix forks with newly issued coins that begin their life with a set amount already issued, usually belonging to the creator. That’s what is meant when people say premined. Saying a fork is equivalent to that is an attempt at discredit it but at the end of the day who cares.

Any fork has all the right to call itself what they want.

The tinfoil fiat-is-bad train of thought is so detrimental to the general adoption of6 BTC by the public. The fact GBTC is trading distorted to BTC is indeed because of the value of a dollar and a bitcoin are not the same, when you look at it from an economic utility perspective. This discrepancy tells us there are a lot of people out there looking to go long BTC but are not tech savvy enough or not comfortable with the risks enough to actually go out and buy BTC.
As it is, anyone long GBTC should cash out and buy BTC, pocketing a nice 33%. That's a lot, but that's what people are willing to pay in order not to have to hold BTC themselves. Crazy, but shows the roadmap for widespread adoption is not the ruin of the fiat system for the make benefit of the glorious cryptoanarchist hipster, but making the blockchain technology "invisible" to the average Joe.

This sparked me to make the following exercise. What would be the value of a bitcoin if it replaced money entirely today, assuming we are already at the cap of 21mio BTC issued?
It makes more sense to look at it from this perspective because you don't have to take into account for inflation in various currencies as we are looking at the current possible value, while using the max available # of BTC as a proxy for a future time when it is all mined.
Now, the best approximation in my opinion would be to compare it to the [world's M2]( M2 is a measure of money supply that includes not only the physical cash issued by a country but also short term deposits that you have in your bank. The data above is in local currency so we translate it into USD, remove small countries and whose currency the code I don't know and we get to 71.74 trillion USD of money supply across the globe. Some countries are left out but we are talking mostly Africa (of which South Africa and Nigeria are accounted for)  and Middle East countries (Of which only Saudi Arabia is represented). All in all we are a bit conservative here, and of course not all 21mio BTC will be available: a fair share of it will be lost so the actual number of free to trade BTC will be smaller. At the same time we are dealing with an extreme where the whole world adopts BTC as a single currency so let's call it even.
This gets us to BTC trading at 3.4mio USD as a ceiling. Looking 30-50 years ahead sure you could get to crazy numbers in USD or EUR terms but then you are adding inflation to the equation and you don't want that. 
TL;DR If we assume all BTC are available and that the whole world scraps their currency for BTC, it would be worth about 3.4mio USD. 
PS: As productivity grows and the world gets richer the size of M2 would increase so that's an upper limit that is somewhat of a moving target. But you need the world to grow above inflation for that to happen.
Now I feel short, time to buy some more...

When you run a full node you are keeping a full copy of the blockchain and acting as a peer to peer node propagating transactions. You are also validating blocks, essentially checking the math so to speak in order to guarantee recently mined blocks are valid. 
The blockchain itself runs over 100GB large. If you understand these basics, it becomes evident that increasing the block size does not double your bandwidth usage.
You are still gonna receive the same tx over the network. Each block will be larger and thus the blockchain will increase at a faster pace, so in the long run it will become linearly more expensive to run a full node if blocks are bigger. 
Saying it will double bandwidth usage overnight is equivocated and fear mongering. Onchain scaling was in the plan from the white paper. Saying it is dangerous or impractical is incorrect and smells of distorting reality to serve ulterior motives, whatever those might be. 
Edit: meant 100GB not 1GB
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:32:40
No true Scotsman, huh?
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:04:00
If I recall correctly, Bitcoin ABC initially did not have any replay protection, which was quickly added ahead of the fork. Assume this will happen here as well?
Being realistic here, anyone who is savvy enough to run their full node knows what they are doing, to the extent of where their transaction is gonna go.
Software wallets could create confusion, I guess.

@_date: 2017-08-19 14:52:26
I see a lot of "longer chain my ass" comments here. I think its clear to everyone the longest chain is not the one with the largest amount of blocks, but the one with the most PoW put into it. Ie the integral of difficulty over length. 
And the BCC crowd knows that and agrees with it. They just mean BCC will "win" and be the longest chain with the most hashing power behind it, reversing the status quo.
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:48:42
I stand corrected. Evidently, since you are, as a node, receiving the blocks propagating through the network any increase in block size impacts your bandwith usage directly.
This impacts people running nodes on capped connections.
While I don't appreciate the harsh tone of your reply, thanks for correcting me as my intent is not to propagate lies.
That being said, the scaling debate seems to be one of which is the lesser evil. Having your transactions offchain because on chain is slow / expensive or having it on chain, but at the cost of full nodes becoming more expensive for a those running capped connections which could lead to centralization.
Do you agree? 
As of now, I still tend to side with on chain scaling as I don't like being forced into second layers because the fees are so damn high.
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:24:17
Yes that's true. As of now, the Segwit chain, BTC, is the main chain with the highest mining power and deve environment. Bitcoin Cash is the runner up. If mining power migrates to the cash chain, it can become the de facto BTC chain as providers flip over. That hasn't happened but is a possibility. 
Again, I advocate holding and not taking sides. BCC might be a buy here if you think the scenario described above has more than 10% probability of happening. Otherwise as William Wallace once said, HODL!!!
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:54:52
Depends on wether you prefer your bitcoin to have segwit activated with a 1mb block size or no segwit with 8mb block size
Other than that they are exactly the same. My advice, don't take sides, buy both sides of the chain and wait to see how this plays out. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:32:57

@_date: 2017-11-13 20:19:36
As a miner their endgame is higher fees. Wouldn’t smaller blocks maximize those? Unless you argue second layer solutions will unclog the network. But then, are you not replacing miner centralization with second layer centralization? Whose business plan depends on layer two fees? Should we not be afraid of this economic group at least as much as we fear the miners?
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:17:30
Thanks for the reply. Given how eloquent your reply was, you must agree you have really not addressed the key issue here. 2Mb blocks make no difference. With today’s hardware and bandwidth, 1Gb might. There isn’t a clear line and I agree with that, but why forfeit small fees? 
Your argument boils down to bigger blocks = centralization, but 1Mb blocks also lead to centralization as you outsource transactions to layers susceptible to government intervention and control by one or few parties. 
The answer to the dilemma seemed clear to me: compromise. Enhance usability by modestly increasing blocksize while focusing on scaling offchain as well. That way you still have a viable sized blockchain while keeping fees low. 
The fact that 2x failed leads me to the conclusion that your future blocksize increase will never happen, and that just creates centralization via second layers. 
I’m sorry but that to me seems throwing the baby with the bath water. If Bitcoin Cash is open to develop improvements to the existing protocol, including offchain scaling solution, it is in my humble opinion the true bitcoin. 
The market might not agree with me yet, not in terms of price but in terms of difficulty integrated over time but I know where I stand.
I believe in exponential growth, expressed in processing power in terms of Moore’s Law but also seen in many other areas of technological development and think bigger blocks are not an issue on the longer term. I think we are being played for fools by Core.

Does the lightning network enable micro transactions? What if I want to share a cab with a buddy and pay him 5 bucks, do I have to open up a channel, lock up money and pay the fees to set it up in order to do that?
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:23:43
And changing the arbitrary 1Mb limit to the equally small 2Mb one in order to alleviate the high fees bitcoin has during busy times doesn’t make sense? Doesn’t it buy time to develop the software solutions that are not yet implemented?
If onchain scaling needs to come as needed, as you say, is this not the time? Why cripple use cases that need low fees from developing? Why divide the user base? Will bitcoin become centralized and owned by Jihan if we double the block size?
Your speech makes a ton of sense. The problem I have is that the ball always gets kicked forward even on the face of decreasing usability, which makes me think there must be ulterior motives behind the procrastination.

He app creates a BCH wallet and a BTC wallet. Yes, people might screw this up, but the wallets are NOT segwit addresses. The only fuck up possible is giving someone a BTC address when you want to receive BCH or vice versa. Both scenarios put you at no risk since you own the private keys on both chains. 
Crypto as a whole is far from idiot proof, bitcoin included. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:35:44
The problem is that BTC has something called replace by fee, which allows you to cancel a transaction that’s already in the pool by respending with higher fee.

The wallet didn’t make the addresses interchangeable. The fork has the same address structure because it is essentially bitcoin as it was before segwit. You might not like that but it’s not the wallets fault. 
We are not going to convince each other I guess so good luck in your endeavors. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:03:58
So they are spamming the mempool to increase fees in order to cause an exodus to a coin they control but has low fees, in order to jack up the fees again on the other coin?
Doesn’t that sound convoluted?
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:19:30
Except this is not the first time BCH was more profitable to mine. In fact it has happened several times in the past and the price remained depressed. 
This narrative does not explain the recent price action of BTC/BCH. The fact 2x was cancelled and people are reading this as 2xers moving to the cash chain is the actual driver of the move.

Logic path for Central Banks to take. Your statement is incorrect. You can point the faults of fractional reserve baking but the fact you can’t even discern banking from central banking tells me you should read up more on the subject before accusing people of being scammers. Incidentally this is the same mistake a lot of people from a financial background make with crypto, disregard it as scams without understating what it is. 
That being said, I’m long descentralized  public ledgers. Since I includes development that restricts my list to Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. So I guess we are on the same page on that

@_date: 2018-02-15 18:52:38
I feel you frame the questions in a way that doesn’t capture the nuance of the proposition. 
I think Central Bank Cryptos is a logical path because it solves a problem govt has with cash, which is privacy. 
So effectively its use in the medium term is likely to be compulsory. It also doesn’t change the way central banks operate under the fractional reserve banking system. The option to have a central bank crypto that has limited supply is ridiculous. 
Central bank crypto is basically fiat where the cash printer is substituted by a digital one. 
I filled out the form but felt my opinions on the matter wouldn’t go though. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:53:22
Well the bitcoin cash folk didn't want segwit so they forked. If core doesn't want 2x, then by all means fork. 
Cash managed to do it successfully in relatively short notice, I'm sure core can manage as well. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:17:24
I think people should be free to do what they want as no one owns the chain. There is only so much hashing power out there and having similar forks is detrimental to the ecosystem. 
That being said, 2Mb or 1Mb is the same thing. My ideal scenario has 1Mb Segwit on one chain, 8Mb on the other and let the mkt decide. 
So while yes forking right and left is not ideal, it's also not to be seen in a way that allows core to hold the community hostage. Miners and exchanges are part of that community. Segwit got traction because of the NYA. So this screaming about 2X is ridiculous. If you don't want it, fork off. It's not ideal, but who gives a shit, Bitcoin needs to be resilient if it is to achieve end game  
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:33:28

@_date: 2017-09-20 23:48:09

One must be really dense in order not to understand this from reading the white paper. Satoshi is talking about attacks as in people propagating false blocks in the network in order to double spend or alter the ledger.

Who are "they"?
Banks are big corporations made up of people. The organization itself is slow moving, and it's goal is to generate revenue using it's capital efficiently. "They" don't care about bitcoin's fate. If bitcoin becomes widespread, it won't kill banking. Corporations will still need credit, they will still have cashflow mismatches. They will still need to raise capital. That's what banks do and it's an important part of our economic system. 
If BTC replaces the USD or what have you, that doesn't change the core business of a bank. Thus, banks are agnostic.
Central banks on the other hand are probably more concerned. Controlling you currency is important to regulate a countries economy. The Euro crisis? It would be much more localized if greece et al could devalue their currencies to make their economy competitive again.
Now, most people don't have a clue about BTC or crypto in general so the institutions will be reactive. The IRS, the Fed, Banks... as BTC gains not in price but usage it will be either regulated to death or become part of the fabric of the economy. Rest assured, banks will be able to make money out of it just as well.
