USD = Free Speech, BTC = Terrorist Hate Money

Are there any more reputable articles to support this claim? Also, US to EU transit is fairly minimal compared to Asian ports anyway.

All that and nobody has even mentioned that with enough wealth you can setup a trust that trades assets without paying capital gains tax. Mmmm mmm, nothing like deregulation for multi\-millionaires and Draconian rates for the serfs to constitute a strong democracy and a maximum velocity of the economy! 
DON'T WORRY! You can pay those taxes instead. Apple is such a cool company, they DESERVE to offshore all their revenue to keep their INNOVATION\^TM infinite. \(Although they are repatriating some of that this year, finally, but only after they negotiated paying half as much in taxes as you\) \- Apple's tax rate on that will be just 15.5&amp; while your capital gains is 35&amp; and your personal income tax is probably 35&amp; [\[Link\]](

You hit the nail on the head here! 100%
The only thing I might add is the fact that the SEC has very tight controls over who can invest early into major technology innovations. As in, most companies start private to prevent hostile takeovers, which limits outsider investment to only the class of certified investors. To be a certified investor you need to already be a millionaire. 
There are some laws trying to change this, like Crowdfunder, but the limits are such that the amount you can invest are extremely strict. It has to be a set amount, like a certain percentage of your annual income. You can't simply put $100 down on a dozen cool companies to spread your risk.
Crypto, as it is a share of a network or a commidity, rather than a security (in most cases) - nicely loops around these laws. And while I understand the need for consumer protection, a lot of those laws just exist to keep the working class poor as hell and permanently endentured to our plutacracy.
At some stage, sweeping over-regulation will damage crypto permanently in the US, China, Europe. Then, around the world, countries that embrace it will find much more efficient economies and greater consumer power. If anything, we'll end up with a scenario where people running mining operations in their basements in the first world are simply providing financial services to the entire third world, but can't access the same services themselves because of failing democracies and regulatory capture. There would be some truly existential irony in that scenario.
Of course, I HOPE it remains a permnently accessible asset class to everybody. It'd be nice to hav e some protections, and an international risk/rating system for ICOs, but hey, you can't beat investing into any emerging market - and crypto is one of the only emerging markets that consumers can actually access.

It's dropping because the GOP just wrote a bill that will let them shut down your bank account and steal your money if you don't fill out paperwork correctly when crossing the border or filling taxes.
It won't pass, but it's enough to scare people into making an exit. The long term hope for all cryptos will be outside the US. The blood culling and prison camps for all us Americans are going to be real fun though.

If I wait a year to cash out, you get the capital gains rate?
Also, I know how trading between USD to BTC you have to pay on any gains on any sale... But what about BTC to LTC? I've beefed up from .45 BTC to .7 just from good trades, is the .3 earned directly taxable, or only if I convert back to USD?
Or do I have to record every single transaction and the exchange at that time, and tax 15% of every trade? (Which seems destructive and impossible, especially with HFT bots.)


So keeping BTC in an exchange like BTC-E is illegal, or just USD?

My friend is a grad student working on experimental plasmonic solar panels that would need 100x less material. I like the idea of automating turning sunlight into money. Resource based economy and everything.
Also, I'm starting running this group at I want to find an easy way to generate passive income so that I could build an application platform and pay open-source contributors.

Are there certain places in the world where data center electricity costs are lower than average?
Is the pricepoint on purchasing an ASIC higher than the return? Are there any patents preventing people from building their own ASICs? You're just saying that having one will be essential for mining?

What if you don't sell it, you just own it and it's worth that much. Do you still pay tax if it's not in USD?

Shoot me an email at iontom AT gmail.com, there's some stuff in google drive I want to show you that you might like. It actually is exactly what you're describing.
And I want to get the right patents and licenses so that it can be protected as an open source public works project.
