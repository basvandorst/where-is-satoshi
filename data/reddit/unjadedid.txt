SecondMarket is based in NY where bitcoin regulated, and with Barry Silbert sitting knees deep in bitcoin his best bet was to resign and maneuver his crypto investments in areas without regulation

Ok Guys. 4 weeks ago I had my first bitcoin atm experience at this very machine. My intention was the cashout some cash from one of my wallets, exactly £100. Typed in the code by hand and everything went fine. Every minute I checked my receipt, there was still 0 of 1 confirmations. After 10 minutes boom I get cash. Only £60 :O "Hardware error, contact support Immediately I take photo of the screen and the 3 £20 notes and send the details support. Few days later the bitcoin machine owner contacted me and told me how I want my money back, cash or bitcoin, I asked for bitcoins and he gave me back £40 in bitcoins.
Sum it all up. Bitcoin atms aren't as perfect as fiat atms but with time, more money will be pumped in that direction and less flaws will occur. 
Few weeks later I went to the tottenham court road machine and took out a much bigger amount and that went smooth as a whistle. Hence why I go back there now.

Localbitcoins.com is good IMO. Using the 2 step authentication system is secure. They give 2 options : for mobile apps. Or desktop apps. I use Google authenticator and have been happy using this system. This works only if your phone is clean and not infected

Everyone be having bitcoin bipolar disorder. When its down everyone is sad. Angry. Depressed. When it's up everyone is happy and ecstatic

Ethereum owners selling off bitcoins after pre-sale

Bitcoin pones the greatest threat to the US dollar, therefore I'm not surprised a US state are the first to regulate it. Banning the coin will only explode the pressure cooker

I'm so tempted to remove my bitcoins. Il be in the loss. But I feel like fiat is still a viable investment vehicle.

Get out there, read a book, look at a map. Don't rely on being spoon fed information

Inflation reduces purchasing power, bitcoin nullifies inflation therefore purchasing power remains same with bitcoin itself. Bitcoin relative to $ purchasing power shall increase but not due to news of a new big merchant
Purchase 100 dell computers with bitcoin and a spike will occur because bitcoin price is user defined, as opposed to fiat stock exchanges with time delays, insider trading.

Stop treating bitcoins like shares on stock exchange (although that's what's happening). For bitcoin to be big it must be kept in circulation non stop

History has taught us that doing this isn't good for mankind. Let *this* bible write itself

Ethereum presents itself to be superior to bitcoin in the long run. Nothing fishy about it. Look up Vitalin Buterik or however its spelt. Anyway he is the guy that came up with the idea of decentralized applications on smartphones and tablets.
This is the dip in form before the rise. IMO

Look, it's an ideal investment vehicle and by all means treat it that way but in the long run it will gain stability and investment won't be possible for the average laymen.
My advice is buy and hold, eventually it will rise and then spend it on groceries, rent, holidays, transport. The future of crypto currency looks fantastic, first let's give it time and patience

If you can get ROI less than 2 months then no. Otherwise buy from exchange. I made the mistake of buying scrypt miners. Im reselling them with light loss

That's not going to happen. Falling to $497 means bitcoin loses around $1.5 billion.
Yes someone could do that if they had evil intentions towards the bitcoin economy, there are two case scenarios:
-Whale is jumping ships
-Evil Whale has been planning something mischievous for a long time

Not anymore, we are over that phase.

Usually give them my honest opinion, but if they need facts then that can be provided too.
Depends on their situation. I met this guy that sent money to his family in Africa. He uses western union. I offered him the bitcoin option.

That's a load of bull because inflation has corrupted the dollars true value. Now divide it by 5.1 and that is the true value of dollar. Prove me wrong but in 4 horsemen they say the dollar haS lost in value five fold

No. And it should stay that way

It depends on *us*. Using bitcoin as an investment vehicle to make profit in fiat currency then yes. If we use it in our economical circulation then we won rely on it so much. 
-Pay for bitcoin. Make profit due to bitcoin rise. Sell bitcoin. Here we rely on fiat currency
-Pay for bitcoin. Make profit due to bitcoin. Pay for rent, groceries, transport. Here we keep the bitcoin alive

AFAIK The closer we get to the limit the harder it will be to mine 1. I'm no psychic but when we get to that point mining will be obsolete. Prove me wrong
