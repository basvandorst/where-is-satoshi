Not necessarily, as the potential short positions will potentially cause some equilibrium. There’s no way to predict. Your best bet might be to just either sell some gains and hope some opportunities to buy lower.

If you have, Think or Swim (TOS) with Futures approval you can see the price action immediately when it opens.
Notional value will open at 8240 BID x 8250 Ask. The tick size is $10 dollar increments. The contract is based on 1 BTC w/ min margin requirements of 33% of the underline position. Basically this puts BTC at $24k price at JAN.

I love the idea, but how do you then guarantee delivery? Exchanges technically are the 3rd party and impartial market place for exchange.

UMMM Actually NO bro NOT according to what I just read in your citation. What you just presented me with are the initial definitions of the agreement construct which in part is usually associated to the formality of any standard legal document. Basically it defines what is considered as "Virtual Currency".

Hi there, I sent you an email and also messaged you as well. It appears for some reason you guys have me as a BUSINESS and you're asking for me to complete my application.
As I stated in my email, this is a private account please undo whatever was done and bring my account back to normal as I AM NOT A BUSINESS entity.

Thanks for that but what I want to know is this.
Say I'm a taker, and I'm floating in and out in the BTC-LTC market.
Say now I place a buy market / taker order for 1BTC ($1k) whereas LTC is trading at .01 which gets me 100 LTC where does it come out from? And how much is my net result in LTC? 
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:41:31
Not sure I'm understanding what you mean...But I think you're saying the disparity is based on liquidity to fiat. 
The thing is, they're publishing prices for both LTC and BTC. This exchange DOES NOT accept FIAT, so your explanation doesn't quite hold in this case.

But then it states:
"Exemption from licensing requirements. The following Persons are exempt from the licensing
requirements otherwise applicable under this Part:
(1) Persons that are chartered under the New York Banking Law and are approved by the superintendent
to engage in Virtual Currency Business Activity; and
(2) merchants and consumers that utilize Virtual Currency solely for the purchase or sale of goods or
services or for investment purposes."
Read the last sentence...I'm reading it as such that consumers CAN purchase for sale of goods (ie buying stuff with crypto currency) or for purposes of investment... What say you?

Yes but if I send 5 BTC  from the wallet node with the original two addresses and use sendtoaddress cli command and all while having activated 1 of the 2 addresses on another blank node with the 5 BTC that you say would be accessible,  then wouldn’t I lose 50% BTC while viewing the balance on the second node?
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:08:41
YES but only up to what that address originally received and is available. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:47:29
I'm too old for this shiiit!
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:26:00
Yes I get that? I want to know how many BTC will it show if I move one of the addresses over to another totally blank node wallet?
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:30:21
So based on what you’re saying is that the address will have access up to the maximum available within the node that that particular address received? In other words, if the address received 10 coins and the wallet has a total of 15 coins, then therefore the address will have a max of 10 coins?

How exactly is this a scam if I'm willing to offer full transparency by providing my source code to anyone who wishes to buy it. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:08:54
YES but only up to what that address originally received and is available.

Easy there Reddit newbie.

Any API interface that's built for use will ask you for creds. But to deal with such concern, I specifically am including the source code so that you guys can inspect the code to alleviate any concerns. Nothing sketchy here.

You have $10k worth of bit coin? Because I'd be willing to buy them from you.
