Remember Mt Gox?  Wasn't the writing on the wall for about 6 months.  Take a 10% hit on getting my cash out, no way. (Thats me by the way).
I was also in Argentina about a week before they went under, ARSUSD 1.00. No one was bothered whether they got USD or ARS, treated them as the same. Now 16 Peso to 1 USD (I think).
Most people expect money to work as advertised and dont pay any attention.

I dont think theres any danger of getting btc back (I am one of those people).  However, btc wasnt problem, gox was, I've bought more.
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:30:34
Its too late to get 100%, too late to get 30% back, but
its going to be 0% if nobody does anything.
Could easily be 20m USD, 
Goxbtc is the largest creditor by a mile, so every other
creditor wants them to just be quiet and sit in the corner
and rip them off AGAIN.

You should read about the history of money in Europe.  In France the whole lot went.  Hungary Germany (twice) all gone to inflation.  
Someone closer to the last fork could probably give a better description but essentially once it forks you get double spends and general panic.  The miners forced through one branch of the blockchain and devs had to rapidly write and release a fix, forcing everyone over to using it.  Price collapsed (as it must).  And this was all over a bug that could be quickly fixed.  If the community was split and a permanent fork occured it would be very very damaging for the currency and probably ruthlessly exploited with double spends and the end of BTC.  Do you want to explain to people how the blockchain forked and they lost all their money?
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:09:35
Ok guys, lets get serious, no live hot btc withdrawls from exchanges.  Every day (or maybe more often, every couple of hours) a full reconcile with block chain and cash accounts, checks on trading etc, if everything is ok, then btc goes out from locked down separated machine.  No more hackable online btc please.  This is not particularly aimed at Bitcurex, must be over 90% of btc exchanges have now been hacked or ended in fraud.

It makes no sense how you can have 0 orphaned blocks and 113 in the same  week.  I really dont understand what blockchain.info was reporting, there are only 144 blocks per day.  I hate to write this, cos I dont think its true, but if a selfish miner had massive hashing power, once they solved a block (and held it back) then they get a head start on all the next blocks and keep winning for the rest of the day.  I think its much more likely that blockchain is reporting something different.  I think people would be complaining here a lot more if one miner was winning all the blocks.

I think (not sure) that the BTC are being treated as "held in custody" assets (i.e. not MtGox's assets) and therefore should be returned to BTC creditors.  Thats why they dont appear as liabilities on the bankruptcy filing.  I doubt the court will order them liquidated to pay off creditors, it would be unusual.
Plus the court is not liquidating MtGox (yet) its trying to do a chapter 11 on it.

So if you could all give evidence on a criminal fraud verbally  to Mt Gox on the phone (in an attempt at the world record in call waiting times), and whatever you do dont contact the authorities or put anything in writing.

If the understanding of the code/movement is correct, 
should move to transactions &lt; 10btc on next split (which is what the code is thought to be doing).  Then I guess it moves to final destination, where ever that is.  If every transaction is split till its less that 10btc then we will have &gt; 20k addresses involved.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:30:38
Am I missing something.  Couldnt you store the log of the balance and hash that.  Then there is no way to store negative balances.  0 balances could be ignored or given a special code.  All the sums would still be the same, but the tree would just not support negative balances.
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:20:27
Not sure why all the abuse.  Pretty reasonable question.  MtGox filed figures saying that 99.7% of BTC had been lost!  There have been transactions recently that indicate that they have more (180k maybe 340K).
I think they filed about 850k as the number they should have had.
Recent hack indicates they thought they had 950K
dont know what to make of that.
It is also not clear whether these liabilities will be merged with the fiat liabilities (~30m usd) and everyone paid out of the same pot, or whether they will be treated as assets in custody and therefore separately.
Having written all of this, I realise it doesnt add any clarity, but there isnt much at the minute.

MtGox will have used lots of addresses to move bitcoins about.  It will probably have hot wallets, cold wallets, in wallets, out wallets.  Your BTC was not held in a segregated account where you could look at it.  
(No it certainly wasnt).
People have been tracing forwards from some accounts Mark showed he had bitcoin in years ago to find out where the Bitcoins went.  Trouble is, its not guaranteed they were his accounts way back then, its been suggested they may have been MtGox founder helping out.  Others have been collection addresses that people sent money to MtGox with to try and analyse from there.  Lot of people claim to have found missing BTC, but not sure anybody other than Mark K, really knows.

i am not an expert in Japanese insolvency either.  I am sure that it is a new area of insolvency law, since the court would have to decide what btc were, arguably they are currency.  I agree thats why the market behaved like that (though I think it was also influenced by the leaked report about 2k BTC balance at MtGox),  it doesnt mean that its true. I would just like someone to represent the goxbtc owners to find out.  If no-one does then we will definately not get anything.  The btc fiat guys appear to have done a 10% of money returned as a fee for the lawyers, I am sure we could do the same (although its going to be harder work to get the money).

Nothing has intrinsic value, money is only used by humans, and they spend it on what they desire, want or need.  People buy lace and persian carpets because they can see the work that has gone into it (and its pretty), I think BTC is similar, you cant get the work back out, but you can see that the work that has gone in to producing it has value, (its beautiful to some) plus its useful, plus I can understand it.   Anyone like to expain the (intrinsic) value of a USD (actually a paper dollar bill is even more interesting).
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:36:58
From 10 minutes looking at code it appears that it looks for outputs less that 1 btc and merges them with outputs &gt; 1 btc.  I guess they got pretty low on their hot balance, but nothing greater than 1 btc, who knows, they did go under after all.  I dont see the code that stops any of the earlier larger transactions getting merged, but as I said, 10 minutes looking.
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:19:15
After tokyo close of business 180k btc believed to belong to mtgox was moved in a fashion consistent with mtgox (leaked) code, apparently into hot wallets in chunks of less that 10btc.  It did this by splitting amounts into two repeatedly and waiting for confirmations, so it took about 2 days to complete.  Btc appear to still be sitting there.  Dont know what it means.

They were all transferred from user addresses to MtGox addresses to trade.  So we know the account balance of every bitcoin address, but only know ownership of a very few addresses. MtGox however, should be able to point to every alleged theft transaction, I doubt they will.

This is whats wrong with fiat.  Essentially you have a share of world financial assets with a USD.  By printing more (do they send you a cheque) they are shifting your share to someone else more deserving (eg bankers who may not get the bonus they were expecting).  We are all techy here and have lived with MASSIVE deflation for 20 years.  Buy 1tb drive now, next year it will be cheaper and ssd, that stopped us buying right?  Deflation fear is a lie put about by people who are going to get the new USD  printed.  If thats you fine, it aint me.

I meant security in the sense of non cash asset.  Cash and non cash assets (particularily those held in custody) have very different treatment in bankruptcy.  If MtGox had all the BTC and no fiat, I don't think the fiat creditors would have any claim on the BTC (in the US).  From what I have read though Japan tends to spread the love over all creditors (i.e. no one gets 100%, no one gets 0%).  After all, apparently we all get to vote on restructuring plan.  I'll believe that when I see it.

I suspect that the killer blow was Mizuho shutting his bank account.  He knows no-one is going to let him open another account without any business accounts, with missing coin and fiat and with regulators etc all over it.  No bank is going to give a BTC exchange a bank account without due dilligence and there is no way MtGox would get through that.
Closing the account is likely to crystalize a lot of problems.

It money which has been linked to MtGox.  
It is moving in the way MtGox used to move large amounts of coin, by randomly splitting into smaller transactions 60/40 until transactions are less than 10 btc.  The MtGox api says withdrawls are being made.
Its not proof and we dont know where its going (should find out in about 8 hours), but its plausible.

If it is money out of Gox using Gox code and it keeps going to 10 BTC chunks, the money should be reaching its destination in just over 8 hours from the tree from this address
(one of the smaller amounts so far and therefore likely to get to 10btc earliest.).
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:16:41
In other threads this appears to be money suspected of being MtGox coin moving from MtGox, via the MtGox "randomly split large transaction into two until they are less than 10btc" code. 
This also indicates coin leaving btc.

Being a bit of a knob, I rekon you can keep going to you get a stable solution, ie where every adresses shortest route is to another address in the list, then you may have MtGox in its entirety.  You may have a few external loops (probably not signficant) and dead ends (there be treasure!).

The one aspect that gets me about insider dealing is the collapse of GoxBTC.  If they are going under, and you cant get fiat or btc back it doesnt make much difference whether you have fiat or btc, (in fact in bankruptcy cash is ownerless, but you do have a claim to assets in custody), UNLESS you know they have zero BTC.  I would bet a lot of money that GoxBTC collapsed once the pdf had been shown to others, at least a week before they are coming out with collective statements about how terrible Tux was and how great they were.

Outside of the US, US citizens are finding it increasingly difficult to open bank accounts/do a lot of financial dealings because anyone dealing with them has to report FAtCA details, anywhere in the world.  Even living abroad you still have to file IRS statements and that store card that you fail to report could be a 10k USD fine.  Thats why quite a few Americans living abroad are renouncing citizenship, I think Roger probably has worries more concerned with law enforcement rather than tax or anything else.

One concern I have is an unresolvable hard fork.  Double spends on each fork, btc essentially splits into two, lots of people lose faith in btc (and lose money).  We had one due to a bug but that was quickly dealt with (though there was at least one confirmed double spend). An idealogical split to implement some feature could be harder to deal with.

As per my previous post, would you consider getting representation for GoxBTCers in the  insolvency process?
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:42:31
Agreed, the crisis report is not official, undated and not written by anyone.  Bitcoin builder sees a goxBTC = 0.17 BTC.  Difficult to believe 740k BTC have gone (incompetent enough not to notice that, but competent enough to get rid of 99.7% of their BTC?)
If the hole is not too big it clearly has value as an exchange so someone may want to buy it out and inject some funds.  (Not 300m+ USD mind).
But, every action they take (halting withdrawls, one by one, shutting website, comms) indicates all is not well at Empty Box.  Todays message is a joke.  Shut the website and then blame media for reporting it?  And the punchline for the relaunch, "trade at Gox, no longer MT (geddit!)". Hmm.

If you can do it instantaneously its is called arbitrage, but you have to remember the price difference is  probably there for a reason.  In MtGox you could sell BTC at a higher price for fiat, but then it took ages to get fiat out  but if you bought  btc you could get out quickly.  That quickly changed when you couldnt get btc out either and people thought fiat would do better in bankruptcy.
On top of that you have fees which eat into the opportunity.  In my experience fiat transfers (both in and out) are slow, so how much credit exposure do you want to A vs B.

Friday evening tokyo time 180k (thought to be gox coin) began moving and splitting.  It seemd to fit with splitBigOutputs and mergeSmallOutputs running.  These were split till they were less than 10 btc.  Since then they have been merged to create 50btc addresses.  Those 50btc addresses then moved this morning.  The last two moves (consolidation and moving) havent been recognised as gox code as far as I know.
I have no idea what this means, but I hate it.  
180k btc are moving without explanation.
The gox code (which is absolutely insecure by all accounts) has been fired up and is on line.  WTF.

Just have.  BTC wasnt the problem, Gox was the problem.  Never worried once about my BTC on the blockchain.  My experience also highlighted a lot of fiat problems, not just with Gox.  "You want to spend your money on what".  Why on earth should I have to justify to a bank/governmet what I am spending money on.  Someone is holding on to the money because you havent filled in a reason for the transfer.

Where it is in 10 years time will depend on the infrastructure and products that the community builds around it to make it work.  So get busy building and the price will go up all by itself.

LOL "take 1/3 and move on".  Too right.  Assets about 30m USD liabilities 550m USD.  Not sure what secured creditors there are but looking at max 5% payout which is about where bitcoinbuilder ended up.    It appears in Japan everyone takes the pain to some degree across all claims, but lets see.
You need small account holders to vote for this.  Not quite sure why you want to clip them, have to clip and awful lot of people to make it worthwhile.  In Cyprus it was the large account holders who got clipped.  Cap on BTC liabilities?  In reality I cant see much justification for not treating all BTC liabilities equally.
Shares in Gox.com for all creditors, maybe, but need a new investor to put money in, and they are going to want a big chunk of equity for that. Gox.com revenues on crypto to crypto, not hugely valuable would be my guess.

Good question, it would implly a fork in Bitcoin which I think is very bad.  If say Ukrainian BtC were different from rest then you could spend Ukrainina BTC and rest of world btc twice.

There are goxcoins and goxcoins.  Goxcoins on bitcoinbuilder are essentially a claim (in BTC) on Mt Gox.  It depends whether you believe court will recognise claim, where you appear in insolvency waterfall etc.
Goxcoin the new coin is a share of future recovered stolen MtGox BTC.  1 new goxcoins to my mind is worth far less that one old goxcoin (and thats not worth much in the first place).  
Apparently the same consultant who produced the mtgox is insolvent report is also helping to produce the new goxcoins.  I think this is all part of MK's plans, so yes I do think this is what he intends to do.
Getting rid of BTC Gox claims is a BIG problem for other creditors. 90% + of claims are BTC.

I think the price of bitcoin is definitely its value in usefulness in USD / 12 million.  I think the calculation (which you admit is a guesstimate) ignores the velocity of the flow.  I am assuming that the $4 Billion is an annual figure for btc remittance.  If, for instance, people who received the money held it for a month before recycling then I think the figure is closer to $308/12.~$25.
It would definately be good for btc, maybe not quite as big as previous calculation.  If people just sat on the btc as a store of wealth, it could be $300 per year mind.

Yeah, it used to be backed by gold, but Nixon broke that trust (defaulted).  In terms of stability, gold has done better than the USD since then, 1971 1 gold oz was 35 USD.  Some would argue gold hasnt done well, USD has done bad.  Had you lost complete faith in the USD in 1971 and put it all in gold, you would only be 32 times richer.

DNS gives your ip very quickly, BTC gives you your balance very quickly.  If you want to change your DNS entry its not quick and can take quite a while.

LOL, that because they have omitted the 500m USD BTC liabilities, cos "Mark is going to give them back to you as BTC."
They managed to "lose" 99.7% of their BTC.  They must have thrown nearly everything at it to keep it going, remember that 10m of their assets are sitting with the DHS and coinlab.  They were stopped by finally running out of everything.

Bitcoin does have issues, trust and volatility are massive issues, and maybe you prefer USD to BTC, but given a choice of BTC and Argentinian Peso, or Ukrainian hryvnia I think you will agree that BTC may not be the best currency in the world, but its also not the worst.  That already is a pretty major achievement in such a short time.  I know what a BTC is, how hard it is to make one, I really dont know what a USD is, if you could please explain I'd be very interested.
Its also pretty easy for some people to make more USD (forgers, Fed).  Given all the fraud with BTC it seems strange to write that actually BTC is unforgeable.
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:46:35
I dont believe in coincidences.  Mt Gox's bank say they are shutting his account and a week or two later MtGox are under.  No one seems to get that this is probably the trigger for subsequent events.  There is no way Mark can open a new account for Mt Gox without any accounts, with missing fiat, probably missing coins, client funds held in business account.  
He knows the game is up after this meeting, shortly later it is.
Coincidence my arse.

They are so rubbish that they dont spot all these coins are going missing over years and yet somehow they are efficient enough to syphon 99.7% of all their BTC to scammers.  Its strange that actually their USD being seized would be an easy problem to solve (actually what happened to the rest of the alleged fiat gap?)  compared to losing ALL of their BTC.  There seems to be so much disinformation about its difficult to work out what might be going on, but its unlikely it will end well (for (my) goxcoins).

The BTC liabilities are probably valued at zero (they have to be for the numbers to work).
The "stolen money" is still on the balance sheet as assets.

The lost fiat implies that MtGox was probably bankrupt BEFORE they lost the BTC and BEFORE they had their money stolen.  As I understand it that loss of fiat has not been adequately explained either.

Mixing will only work well when similar size amounts are being mixed.  If you mix 120million with 50k its pretty easy to find where at least 119.95 million is.  Mixing 50k with 50k you cant tell whose coins are whose.  
So if you wanted to mix coins you have to break them up into more manageable sizes.
I dont actually think that is what is going on here.  MtGox breaks up large transactions in exactly this fashion before sending out.  The code is linked on this site.  It looks like this is MtGox money moving somewhere!

As someone how is goxed (stupidly) I can answer that question.  Gox may have been bad, but it appeared better than the alternatives.  Some guys in Slovenia (bitstamp), no-one seems to know where btc-e are at all.  The US ones which dont take international money.  (Actually now use bitstamp and its astonishing dealing with a site that just works coming from Gox).  
There were many red flags around Gox which i was aware of, but I foolishly thought they were going through a rough patch after their money was seized.  I also thought they had so many oppourtunities to make money that they must be able to remain solvent.  Arbs with other exchanges for instance.  Being long btc as the price went up to the moon.  Fees.  
Then, it took ages (4 months), but money had started coming out which was quite a relief, so my faith in them had increased.  I got the impression of a company struggling to overcome adversity.
Now, going over it all, I realise that it is and always was a scam.
But finally, if you wanted BTC you could mine yourself (Ha), buy a miner (Good luck, some very Gox like behviour reported there), or deal with a dodgy exchange, there arent any good ones.  (I like Bitstamp, but can I guarantee its bona fide, no, how?)

Criminal negligence (in UK.) is negligence they can send you to jail for rather than negligence which is just a civil affair.
True, don't know if they have it in Japan, I would imagine they have something similar.

If you see something in a market that is very detailed and intricate (say lace) and would take a lot of work for you to reproduce, if you even could, you would have little problem paying for it, and thus giving it some value.  Bitcoin is like that, you are buying a proof that a lot of work went into your producing a bitcoins of which there are only so many.  If you try mining on a pc (not recommended) you will see that it is thousands of years of work for that pc to produce a bitcoin.  Now what is the dollar backed by again, and whats the limit on number of dollars.  I would say 99% of people could not explain what a 1 dollar bill represents (its a paper TOKEN of Federal Reserve liability, not even on their balance sheet) but we are all so used to it that no one thinks about it.  Once people have confidence in bitcoin its price will be determined by its usefulness, not intrinsic cost of production or anything else.  Price will be USD value being used/number of bitcoins. (In fact it already is!)

There are (at least) two distinct classes of claimant, ones with fiat deposits and ones with btc deposits.  There claims may conflict with each other (the higher the btc payout, the lower the fiat payout).  What are your views on the merits of each and how do you propose handling the conflict.
@_date: 2014-03-24 15:02:12
I'm in denial
At least no more orphaned blocks than usual.
Each block solved by a selfish miner would guarantee an orphaned block (either miners or someone elses) so you would expect an increase in orphaned blocks with more selfish miners.  So either there are no selfish miners now, or no more than there ever were (as a percentage).

I guess, everyone gets nutted, given shares in Gox.com (no longer MT geddit), someone puts in 10m USD to run the thing, rewrite code and away you go.  Im not sure BTC creditors will be quite as easy to get rid off as Mark imagines (if he needs 500k votes for a plan I dont think hes going to get them), or that criminal parts of collapse are going to go away.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:40:01
I think it does, the large transactions are not available for output, so dont get used, its only when they are less than 10btc that they become available and are joined up with all the small change.
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:05:40
Thats the point, to get the GoxBtC holders recognised as creditors.
The fiat holders at Gox are recognised as such.
Personally I dont think it makes any difference what the nature of the asset you held at Gox is to have a claim against Gox assets.  If it was 500m USD of manure, no-one would think twice about it being a valid claim.  I am a bit surprised that people seem to be thinking that BTC is going to be treated as fairy dust in wind up.  It will if you let them.

For who?  Sadly there is a split in Goxers between fiat owners and BTC owners.  Good news for one can be bad news for the other.  It appears to me (waiting for a good translation) to recognise that BTC claims will have to be part of the settlement, which is bad news for fiat holders.

I dont know what you got, but the shortest link between these addresses are probably all Mt Gox addresses, you could probably expand pretty quickly on that basis (and the same applies for all the addresses that you pick up that way), every combo.

I really like the idea, but i do have major concerns.  Do I really want my browser and wallet interacting, or even open at the same time.  I view my browser as a major vulnerability.  Really need another website where I can send a small amount of btc and then tip at will on the browser.  Anyway, never let the people who say it can't be done stop other people actually doing it is my view, so good luck, hope you report back.

Cash actually (in terms of a dollar bill) is a paper token exchangeable for a dollar asset at the central bank.  When the Fed print a paper dollar they see it as 1 dollar of profit on their accounts, i.e. they have sold you paper and you have bought it for a dollar.  And a dollar asset at the Fed is not exactly the most transparent asset in the world.
Shells, beads, coins, gold, paper money, btc  its all about confidence.  I think youre a little unfair in that btc provides a trust free form accounting and production, but you prefer paper money, fine, there was a time when paper money was ridiculous, and if you read about paper money in europe when it started its amazing that we are still using it.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:39:12
Personally no.  These are claims on recovered stolen btc (minus finders fee).  Pretty low value.  Are you going to give up your claim on whatevers left (not much) for even less.  If these are given to goxcoin holders only  then thats all you are going to get (next to nothing).  If they are given to everyone with a claim, maybe, but whats the point of them then.  Gox still has apparently 180k btc.  Id rather stick with a share of that.  I think it also has a credibility problem in that it is a way of getting rid of massive btc liabilities.
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:59:49

My understanding is that that price is totally irrelevant. Thats not the price of a BTC (MtGox liability) but the price of a claim on a Gox BTC (that dont exist).
Its possible that BTC claims are treated like a safe deposit store getting robbed and then filing for bankruptcy.  The customer assets going are a criminal act, the insolvency is a civil act.  Customer assets (in the boxs) are not listed as liabilities on balance sheet.  
I have no idea whether missing assets get converted to general creditors.
It could have a good side in that if some BTC turn up they may go straight out to depositers, fiat holders will almost certainly have a large haircut.
Best possible outcome (assuming no new assets turn up and that the 180k BTC moving is Goxs available for depositers) 
0.20btc per goxbtc. 0.30 USD per goxUSD.

I found a link 
In it
"This rule essentially provides that a 
junior creditor may recover some level of recovery 
notwithstanding the fact that a senior creditor has 
not recovered in full, provided, however, that the 
junior creditor must receive less favorable terms 
than the senior creditor"
"Week 9 claims bar date."
Also junior creditors do get a vote on plan (apparently)
I know its going to be peanuts, but some people have lost everything.

This is such BS.  I am going to recommend a fixed 2% inflation rate in BTC by paying me 2% of outstanding BTC each year so that people dont need to worry about the value of their savings account.  If you are getting the central banks extra money each year, fine, if not, youre getting diluted out each and every year.
Edit, didnt mean to be rude, just pushed wrong buttons.

The fiat situation indicates that MtGox has been insolvent for a long time (unexplained) which means that MK has been lying and committing fraud for quite a while.  Once you realise that then anything he says is likely to be an excuse designed to save his arse.  I started off believing he was just out of his depth, but that cant be true.  You dont need something underground to explain this all, just plain old fraud will do. I dont know if its really him, but today on reddit hes being quoted as saying that the btc liabilities werent recorded in filing because he was going to pay them back in btc. yeah right, hes going to find 700K btc lying around somewhere.  Its lies all the way. He cant talk, hes gagged, only allowed to tell lies?
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:20:09
So fork the blockchain (remember what happened last fork?) because of a scam.  Put the whole currency at risk, introduce a central bank to bail people out of a fraud?  One fork where miners act collectively, other one more independent.  Which one to join, one where miners could agree to move all the BTC to themselves, other one without main miners.  Its a very very bad idea, sorry.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:02:59
Firstly you are right, the theft should be totally transparent on the blockchain and indeed people are asking mt gox to point to the theft transactions (which they havent done).  
However, knowing what address they are sitting in tells you nothing about ownership.
Indeed mt gox could point to transactions and say they are theft even though they control both addresses.  No one could prove different if they use a clean address.
Secondly its not clear how the theft took place.  If you believe mt gox, they sent the btc twice because they thought the first transaction had failed, so there are no compromised keys just bugs in their software.
A chain of custody for keys is going to be difficult, if they were on a database and someone hacked it?  If someone took a photo on their phone of the paper wallet?  There are a thousand ways the keys got leaked, and they dont even need to be leaked for the money to go missing.

No.  If a bank has 105 assets and 100 liabilities it has a 5% reserve.  Here we have 50 assets and 100 liabilites and its insolvent.  In reality we have 50 assets and 500 in liabilites if you include BTC.  Plus its an exchange not a bank, its supposed to have all the client assets untouched.

Long Bitcoin personally but this is not good for BTC IMHO. A store of wealth shouldnt be this volatile.  Who is going to spend bitcoin if you might have overspent by 20% by the end of the day.  Who is going to sell for bitcoin if by the time you get paid its gone down by 10% (e.g. now).  I want Bitcoin to do well, but this sort of volatility is only going to hinder BTC commerce.
As I speak, its gone bananas.
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:19:43


We dont know that, you may be right.  BTC is linked though to cost of kit and electricity.
Just looked at calculator, can you not make money mining at 10,000 BTCUSD these days?
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:22:31
If you mean the monetary base, or total value of BTC would have to be a lot larger and there's no non-volatile way to get there, there is, 0.5% per day would do it reasonably quickly, but I take your point.
However it wont get there when it drops in value by 10% in seconds or rises that fast for that matter.  I dont know whats happening now, but its not organic growth.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:12:24


The percentage price volatility is the volatility of the overall total amount of money that all BTC is valued at, measured in USD or whatever currency you choose.


You seem to be misunderstanding people buying BTC for USD.  The price of BTC is not the net sum of all the USD (or whatever) paid for BTC.  The amount of USD paid for BTC has not doubled over the last couple of days.  It is determined by a diverse group of people valuing BTC for themselves and either buying or selling.  For every buyer there has been a seller.  The market cap has gone up exponentially this week, a much more gentle increase in price due to increasing acceptance (and therefore value imbued to it), I think would be much more healthy.
I think its unhealthy, would you take your salary at 470 BTCUSD in BTC at the minute, tomorrow you might not be able to make mortgage payments (or live in a mansion).  It doesn't work as a store of wealth or a medium of exchange at this (or anything close) to this level of volatility.
