Nothing is stopping fractional reserve from happening in bitcoin (in fact, exchanges could already be running like this).  
However, LN is not a mechanism for fractional reserve creation as some people seem to believe, as it is impossible to create extra BTC out of thin air.  
Even if people use the somewhat incorrect term of IOU's for LN bitcoins, they should remember that in this model the underlying bitcoins can not be used for other purposes.

Your "understands economics" column seems more than a bit biased....
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:22:12
No, because these are not normal IOUs that are disconnected from the underlying asset.  Thus you cannot multiply/print new money.
In LN, the underlying asset is anchored in the funding channel and cannot be moved while you are transacting in LN.
In fact, I think using the IOU/certificate terminology altogether is quite flawed.

It is a way of making multiple fast and cheap payments in bitcoin, while only needing to make very few onchain transactions (that are put on the blockchain and cost more money in fees and take more time).
So you make some initial onchain transactions to set up your balance and connect to some other people, after that you are set to go and you can make a large amount of cheap and fast payments.

Intrinsic value is a bogus concept.
In your example of the bonds, you make the assumption that the interest is valuable.  But if there is no market for the fiat that your bond is denominated in, then that interest also has no value (how much would you pay for bond that gave you interest in digital Reichsmarks?).
Commodities have intrinsic value?  Ok, what is the intrinsic value of water?  Would you not agree that water might be supervaluable for somebody dying of thirst in the desert, but might be loathed by somebody who is drowning in the ocean?  Or oxygen, which we need to survive, but which was toxic to many early lifeforms?
@_date: 2019-07-14 01:47:50
'Intrinsic value' and actually even the word 'value' itself is nonsensical when you think about it, because the word 'value' makes you think that it is a property of an object (or a service or whatever, I'll discuss objects since that is easier to illustrate).  That is not the case.  Objects have certain physical properties that enable them to be used in various use-cases (utility).  How desirable a utility is depends on the person needing or wanting that utility, it is not an inherent property.
It is funny how a lot of respected economists still don't seem to grasp this.

You wouldn't be able to barter a bond in Reichsmarks currently, because it would be worthless.
'what you can use something for' is called the utility of something, there is no reason to come up with something like intrinsic value, which as a concept is just a nonsensical mix of utility and price being smudged together.

I think you are looking for a concrete example of progress that has been made.  One example that I like is that they have been able to bring the DNA for 2 mitochondrial proteins into the nuclear DNA.  The relevance of this is that this DNA is much better protected from mutations in the nucleus compared to the mitochondria where it normally resides.  There only a few proteins with their DNA in the mitochondria left, so if we are able to bring all of their DNA into the nucleus (while making sure the proteins get into the mitochondria), we will have solved 1 cause of aging damage, as well as a few diseases.
This is of course just an example, a more complete list of publications (if you want to make sure that they are not bullshitters) can be found [here] (

I think it is quite possible, even likely, that bitcoin will have a huge effect on the monetary system and therefore the world.  
But it is a big difference between saying that something will have a big impact, and probably on average will be very positive for the world, and it "saving the world".  Imagine a caveman introducing another to the invention of firekeeping.  Did our ability to manipulate fire have a very profound positive effect on humanity (keeping warm, keeping away predators, cooking food, melting metal, ....): yes!   Was it only positive (burns, entire towns wiped away....): no!   Did it "save the world" and transform it into a eutopia in which everybody only loved eachother and there was no crime, war .... : no!  Was it net positive for humanity: I think so.

Thanks for the reply, but this is a word game that makes no sense. Your main argument boils down to calling 1 of the resulting coins after a fork the "real" coin (XCoin becomes XCoin +NewCoin) and acting like it has retained all value while the other one (NewCoin) has no value at all. 
In reality, the situation is better described by XCoin turning into XCoinA + XCoinB
The economically logical thing to do would be to change your loan agreements that in case of a split, the borrower has to repay both coins.
Perhaps you don't want to go down this road for practical reasons (Poloniex would have to support each fork of a coin that trades on margin), but don't pretend like you are implementing a system that is economically logical for your customers.

I agree 100%. The word "value" itself is even somewhat flawed.  "Value" is trying to put a property on the object or thing itself, and could also be described as "desirability".  Why is something valuable?  Because some people want it.  Something can be valuable for 1 person but not for the next.  Of course then you can see that "value" or "desirability" is not an intrinsic property of the thing itself, but rather exists in the minds of people who want something (as you already pointed out).

Off-chain can mean 2 things:
1) a separate database (like how exchanges transport bitcoins from 1 internal wallet to the next internal wallet).  You have to trust the database owner that the bitcoins are actually still there, and that he isn't just artificially inflating the numbers. You also trust him to keep the actual private keys of the bitcoins on the real blockchain safe.
2) Using a level 2 solution with dedicated payment channels.  Digital signatures get exchanged as a new type of payment, but in the end (when the channel closes) the settlement occurs as a regular blockchain payment. Here, there is no risk of a fractional reserve or people running off with your money.  The total amount of bitcoins cannot be altered, and you remain in control of the private keys.
People tend to confuse things and attribute the drawbacks of centralized databases when discussing layer 2 solutions (because off-chain and IOU are vague terms.

Node counts are easily inflatable. I don't want a mechanism by which you can easily buy "influence" for cheap. This is way too gameable.
Yes, I can mine, but why would every user need to become a miner to have their opinion heard? This could result in a situation in which mining becomes overcompetitive, costing more than it gives in profit, again just to buy influence. Moreover, mining is already a highly specialized activity for very technical people. I don't see why communication of preferences would need to cost money or require a lot of time investment.
 
Indeed I can voice my opinion on forums, but it is hard to quantify this. Creating sock-puppets is easy, and post moderation/upvoting/downvoting are an issue too. Moreover, anyone can post, even without having any skin in the game.
 
Of course I can hold bitcoin, but how is that helping me express how I want to see it evolve in the future? Devs and miners don't have a crystal ball to gauge what users think.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:35:26
I think it is very good for the exchanges and Poloniex to bring clarity into this matter.
My only problem (which is a substantial one I believe) is the policy to only return 1 type of coin.  That is complete bullshit imho.  If someone borrowed the coin for shorting, and then the chain splits, it only makes sense he should buy back both resulting coins.  The way things are handled now, it would be like a stock split in which you only receive 1 of the new shares...

You seem to be missing my point.  I know that nodes and miners have an important function in the bitcoin system.  I am not proposing proof of stake or something like that.  
My point is that it would be useful to determine the wishes of the users.  If you are reading the crypto reddits then this is obvious imho.  Devs say that they develop for the community, yet what the community wants is not always very clear.  You have people suggesting user-activated soft forks, yet there is no good mechanism to determine what users want.

The sentiment that I perceive with these kinds of remarks is: "everything is perky, fees are superlow, don't whine about it you big crybabies".  This attitude bothers me.  Sure, bitcoin is doing ok, and for some use cases this is much lower fee-wise than alternatives that are available today.  For other uses, not so much.  We should at least strive to keep fees as low as possible (and bitcoin accessible to the greatest number of people) as long as we stay rather conservative and don't risk bitcoins decentralisation.

Actually now that I think about it, new channels would still have to be opened or closed from time to time to reflect a change of BTC ownership that is bigger than that of counterparties in existing channels (I might be expressing myself poorly), so this isn't a real issue.
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:35:46
Very eloquently put.
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:17:50
Why do you assume that LN will be bad for miner fees?   There is plenty of need for transactions, and on-chain transactions are necessary for channel opening and closing.  When each channel represents a large number of LN transactions, paying high onchain fees becomes economically feasible.  Only a situation in which everybody switched to LN for all their transactions, and channels would remain open forever could be problematic for miners.  If needed, I guess a maximal channel opening time could be implemented, but we are a long long way from that scenario.  For now, miners would profit from LN functionality: the bitcoins they mine would become more valuable, and people will be willing to pay higher fees.
EDIT: as explained below, I no longer think my comment about channels staying open forever make sense.  Channels will have to be closed and opened from time to time (to adjust BTC balances of the users, when they go outside of the range of the existing payment channels he has open).
@_date: 2018-06-03 12:39:53

As said above, I made up some numbers on the spot.  I rounded down these fees to zero as they were not necessary to make my point.  How much these fees would be is currently unknown.  But they could be for free, with the incentive of just being part of the LN and being able to perform instant-speed cheap transactions with BTC.


That's not what I said at all.  I said that there is a demand for cheap and instant transactions that currently isn't being met.  An active LN would add this demand to the BTC market.

If I understood it correctly, it is not so much an IOU, as trading the transaction signatures without broadcasting them to the normal bitcoin network (except when you close the channel = settlement). You basically give eachother the potential to close out the channel with an updated BTC amount.  
Perhaps you meant the same thing, but for me an IOU is something different (you could potentially create IOUs for an infinite amount of money, but you can't create an infinite amount of BTCs with LN).

I greatly appreciate various properties of bitcoin. I am not saying fees should be low at all costs, I am quite ok with things as they are (especially if layer2 solutions would come online soon). But some people act like 10 cent fees per transaction is a goal in and of itself, that we shouldn't aspire to do better and that making bitcoin available for many people and for many use cases is not worthy of pursuit.

If that money wasn't spent on bombs, it would be spent on something else, which would equally ok for the economy. in fact, it would probably be better because that other thing is less likely to destroy value, it might even be spent on something productive.
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:15:30
In a market at equilibrium, bitcoin miners will spend slightly less for mining costs than what they earn in bitcoin (they need a bit of profit, and if their profits are very high, then new miners will enter due to the profitability, and the competition will drive down profitability).  Some of their costs are the development or buying of mining equipment, and some of it is the energy required to run their mining equipment.  When the bitcoin price rises,  more money will be spent on energy to run the mining equipment (on average an equal percentage increase as the price increase).
Future halvings will decrease the amount of bitcoins earned and will thus reduce the amount of energy spent more and more (unless they more than double the bitcoin price).  The transaction fees will remain though.

I wholeheartedly agree with the gist of your post.  People tend to be impatient and want everything to be there right from the start (and if it isn't they might even say it is impossible to accomplish). So yeah, we need to give the devs and the ecosystem some time to grow and evolve.

This looks like an interesting idea but a bit clunky.  If somebody passes me one of these, I want to know how much is on there immediately !  Like in 2 seconds. 
I also wonder about the actual use case, these cost over 10 bucks per piece, but are apparently adviced to contain low amounts of money.  How economical is that?  
Lastly, how will you carry these around without breaking them?  
These seem like a big upgrade from the physical bitcoins from before, but right now I don't see these being used outside of certain niches (maybe these are nice for gifting friends or family members that are less technical).  Would love to be proven wrong.
@_date: 2016-12-12 16:09:16
It might become less expensive while miners get more fees: 20k LN transactions (fees rounded down to 0 $) + 2 onchain channel opening/closing transactions for 1 dollar each fee (2$ fees)= 10k transactions per dollar in fees.
On the other hand, 2 normal transactions with 0.1$ fee = 10 transactions per dollar in fees.  
Meanwhile the miners get 2$ instead of 0.2$ for 2 onchain transactions.
The secret sauce is that there is a large untapped demand for cheap and fast transactions.  
Instead of seeing LN as taking away a part of the pie, look at it as growing the pie (and then taking a piece of it).  
Of course, there are alot of variables here that could alter the fee market (I made up some numbers on the spot for this example, but it is to clarify a point).
@_date: 2016-12-12 16:54:23
Onchain transactions will still be needed in order for people to gain/control more BTCs than were in their original channels.

It's a good question, and I don't have a great answer. 
I think actively looking for ways in which bitcoin could fail or would be stunted in its growth can help keep you somewhat sober.  
Of course you still need to assign some probability to those based on gut feelings, and you should avoid becoming overly pessimistic because not everything has been solved completely already.
Recognizing investor fluff and sensational articles/posts/sentences can also keep you in check somewhat.  Try looking at an article from a distance.  Are they really digging into important issues, contemplating on them and providing really useful information, or are they basically just writing a bunch of words down with no other real content than : this is going to the moon, it is scarce, don't miss out, you ll be rich. (They might be right, but you want to base your estimates or the former rather than the latter).

Long-term trend is easy to spot if you just look at the all time price chart in log scale.
Of course the price action needs to be backed by fundamentals.
Bitcoin has all the properties of money (divisible, fungible, durable, (trans)portable ...), and its money supply scheme is much better than that of fiat currencies or gold (max 21 million, predictable supply inflation rate etc.). 
It is very easy to transport large amounts unnoticed and cheaply, you can keep multiple backup copies, you can encrypt your private keys so they can't be used by a thief.  Storing large amounts securely is free or practically free (try storing millions or billions worth of gold in a tiny safe at the bank). 
There is a very different risk model compared to much of the rest of the traditional financial system, so from a risk management/ diversification perspective this is interesting.  In bitcoin there is no risk of a counterparty going broke or breaking their promise, there are only network and regulatory risks.
I am not 100% sure if it will win the race compared to other cryptos, but it has the largest network, biggest brand name and a history of keeping true to the principles of hard money (finality of payment, no rollbacks etc.).

The transactions with the fattest fees go to the miner of the next block, which could be a miner different from Antpool.  Even if the average feerate might rise, this favors other miners over Antpool (because they are letting the most attractive fees go).

About where your coins go: there are of course no physical coins.  What you have is an amount of btc written in a special sort of ledger (the blockchain).  Copies of this ledger are stored and made accessible by everyone that runs a full node (the bitcoin network).  Your private keys allow you to be the only one to make transactions with your coins on this ledger (they work like a sort of password).

I'll probably get downvoted for this, but whatever.
First off, I generally support what Core is doing, and I think bitcoin cash is likely a misguided project.
However, I have to say that, having gone through the first part of the interview, I find Carvallo's interviewing style quite arrogant.  He just assumes that the way he sees it is the right one, and everybody has to see it that way.  He also seems to have a habit of attacking technicalities in order to 'be right and win the debate' instead of addressing the big points.
I don't like the fact that people tend to demonize Roger in this sub.  I don't think he has the right vision on scaling, and he is a black-and-white thinker, but he is not a retard or an evil overlord trying to destroy bitcoin as he is sometimes made out to be.  He just acts in whatever way he thinks is right (and will make him some money no doubt).  Whether this will harm bitcoin or strenghten it in the long run remains to be seen.  I used to be anti-altcoins but right now I think competition and the existence of alternatives could actually strengthen bitcoin.

If you are able to double your money with vintage/antiques in months then I think you have found your personal goldmine (unless it scales very badly and the amounts involved are miniscule for you).
If you are more or less clueless, then don't expect to make money trading.  NotMyRealAcct has valuable comments I think.
If you want to learn, start by reading and thinking, not by diving in head first.  I agree that there are some things to be learned from having actual experience and actually doing things. The degree to which this is necessary in a learning process may depend on the person, but reading and thinking will definitely be cheaper than blowing through 1k euro on a few whims.

You set up a special bitcoin transaction with someone else on the bitcoin blockchain, where you lock in btc that you can send him, and he locks in btc that he can send you.  This is the payment channel.  Now if you want to send him some btc, instead of broadcasting the transaction to the bitcoin network, you instead give the other guy the digital signature, so he could in principle broadcast the transaction.  However, he doesn't and could instead decide to pay you back double, and send you an updated digital signature.  You can keep doing this without having to make actual extra bitcoin transactions on the blockchain.  Finally, when everyone is pleased, you can broadcast to the main chain.  This is how payment channels work.  
Lightning Network builds on top of that by building a network of these payment channels, and allowing you to pay some distant party by routing through these payment channels.
The advantage is that these payments are superfast, will likely be very cheap fee-wise and don't take up blockchain space (apart from setting up and closing the initial payment channel).  
This is how I believe it works, but I am not a technical expert.

I agree that bitcoin has the properties of a nearly perfect store of value, which gives me a lot of confidence in the long term (especially if governments don't go on a crusade against it).
I would argue that a lot of your evaluation criteria seem a bit off though.  Stock cannot be used to buy coffee.... really?

I have a lot of respect for Hal, but this economic thinking is flawed imo.  There is no reason why the value of the world currency would need to equal total wealth in the world, in fact it can't, because the total wealth of the world (WW) equals the value of bitcoin plus the value of real estate, plus the value of stocks (S) etc. . Since real estate and stocks have some value, this turns out to be false. To put it somewhat mathematically, if WW = (BTC + RE + S) and RE !=0, (and S !=0) then WW == BTC is false.

Your dad sounds like a cool guy.  I would buy a hardware wallet (I like Trezor).  
I am bullish about the bitcoin price, but please be aware that bitcoin is currently going through a phase of rapid price appreciation (typically called a 'bubble' by bitcoiners even if we don't think it is overvalued in the long term), and that means that in all likelihood there will also be a long period of falling prices ahead of us.

It doesn't.  Mining expenses should always be slightly below the bitcoin price to earn a profit (except when mined coins have extra utility beyond selling them, for example for escaping capital controls etc.).
If the halving leads to a price appreciation that is more than double the previous price, then indeed overall mining expenses will go up. 
Separate to all that, the amount of hash power per dollar invested in mining usually grows over time due to technological improvement.
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:27:35
No, it doesn't.  Many people fail to see money as a commodity in it's own right with its own value.  They think that because wealth can be expressed in a currency, currency somehow equals all wealth.  It's like thinking that because you can express length in meters, therefore the combined length of all measuring sticks must equal the combined length of all things in the universe.  
For currencies this mistake is often made because people get confused about what money is.
You see the same kind of flawed reasoning when people argue that because the value of bitcoins can be expressed in dollars, bitcoin can never be valuable without the dollar existing...

The thing with an inflationary currency is that you are encouraged to always spend now, rather than being able to wait until you find something really worthwhile.
Also, buying random crap might boost economic metrics like GDP, but don't contribute to a meaningful improvement in life quality.
Working 12 hours a day to produce lots of plastic throwaway crap in order to buy other plastic throwaway crap is not always better in terms of life quality than working 6 hours, buying less stuff, and spending some time relaxing with friends and family.

I agree that with a deflationary currency, economic growth might be slowed.  Then again, so might malinvestment and boom-bust cycles.  
Cultural, technological, social: why do you think that?  You seem to have the perception that the entire economy would grind to a total halt, or a measly trickle at the most.  I think the readjustment phase might be painful, but afterwards it would be quite ok.
Why wouldn't people buy iPhones anymore?  Maybe they would replace them less frequently, so what?  Might be better for the environment to have less junk on landfills.  
Behavior like buying on credit is somewhat encouraged by inflation.  Keeping money on a savings account is borderline irrational in the current environment (unless you are speculating that there will be a stock market downturn etc.).  
I can see the use of credit and debt for intelligent or business-savy people that are in need of capital who want to invest in a business or in their education.  A mildly deflationary world would still have credit, paying it back would be somewhat harder than it is now.  Low return/risk investments would be priced out, so that might slow things down, true.  But a lot of the current problems, with people putting their money in risky investments to keep some purchasing power, or where saver's money are being redirected at banks etc. would also be fixed to a degree.

Decent post, sad but true that you have to start with "before you start calling me a concern troll". Tribal fanboy mentality makes some people obnoxious. As for the content of your post, I think several decent replies have already been given.  There is more efficiency to be gained in both basic bitcoin txs and LN setup (and hopefully more ideas to come), block size will probably be increased in the future, and more centralized systems will complement LN to reduce transaction load. Probably won't be easy to reach the scale we want though.

I agree that talking about price inflation masks the fact that gains from productivity increases are being transfered to goverments and banks.
That being said, there is more money than base money, so - especially in the short term- the amount of loans that are taken etc. can a big effect on the amount of money in circulation.

I think LN is great to get the scale and speed needed for merchant adoption, but they would still convert to fiat.  Bitcoin is still way too volatile to just accept and hold without exchange rate risk.  I am quite confident the volatility will keep decreasing in the future though.
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:24:44
I get a lower number based on comparing to fiat currency since I actually prefer to compare to base money. Even in a bitcoin-dominated world lending (fractional reserve banking) will be a thing.  I would guess though that if bitcoin dominated the currency market, there would be less lending than there is today (because of it's price deflationary characteristic it becomes more attractive to hodl than to lend out to marginally profitable businesses).  So the level of fractional reserve lending goes down as well as the money multiplier, meaning that  base money would become more valuable (a larger percentage of total money).
However, bitcoin would also take over some of the value of other stores of value, I was always convinced it could take a huge part of gold's value, but I recently have become convinced that it can take a decent chunk from the bond market, some of real estate and a little bit of the stock market as well.

How does the bet that the median monthly blocksize will be below 0.9MB after 2 months of SW activation sound?  I'll take you up on it (saying it will be higher).  Feel free to suggest different parameters.  Some trustable form of escrow or multisig is ok for me.
@_date: 2016-10-31 20:52:52
First off, the customer does not need to open an individual payment channel with the business.  It is called the Lightning *Network* for a reason.  The buyer having any  channel open within the network should be enough to reach the business.  
Next, any payment is final.  This is different from the traditional payment model with fiat since bitcoin favors the merchant instead of the buyer.  Chargebacks are not a part of bitcoin or the LN system, so I guess chargebacks would only happen if the legal system forces the business to repay the customer.  
Thus, you should probably only make large purchases from reputable businesses, or some form of automated escrow could become common practice (BTW I think LN or a LN-like system is also very handy for solving the "who goes first" problem of automated escrow without a third party).
@_date: 2016-10-31 21:11:49
Waiting longer than 15 seconds is a huge pain in the ass and a bad user experience. 
Moreover, due to the stochastic nature of block solving time (uncertainty of how fast a new block will be found) and the uncertainty of your transaction getting included in the next block, combined with the fact that a business might only accept your payment for a certain amount of time (to limit exchange risk), it can be a stressing experience. 
Only zero-confirmation transactions being accepted gives a nice user experience, but these aren't very secure.
LN has the potential to make using bitcoin for online purchases orders of magnitudes better than it is now.

You are right that quality will generally prevail.  I don't doubt however that some businesses went bankrupt while offering a better service than a competing business with better sales people.  That was not the point I was trying to make though.  I don't see bitcoin as a product that needs to be shoved in people's throat via extensive PR.  
Going a bit more abstract again: people make decisions based on their beliefs.  
They are also not omniscient (or generally able to read and comprehend every line of code in the software they use), so these beliefs are based on what they hear and read.  Therefore good communication is important.  
If somebody believes that activating SegWit somehow equates to them abandoning the 'true' bitcoin and becoming a banker slave, they will chose not to activate, even if in reality it is in their best interest to do so.  
Importantly, for every hardhead on r/btc that refuses to listen to any form of reason and insists that Blockstream and Greg Maxwell are the devil, there might be 10 times more that are lurking, haven't really made up their mind, and are willing to weigh the arguments.  Therefore decent argumentation is preferable compared to tribal insults from the 'opposing team'. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:31:50

Has more to do with miner centralization I believe. If the blocks are too big, it will take too long to reach other miners.  Each second later is another second the current miner can already try to mine the new block while other miners are waiting.

Blocksize *is* important, the thing is that you can't just raise it to be large enough to meet all future demand without severely compromising the decentralised nature of bitcoin, which is one of the key features that make bitcoin special and valuable.  It is almost sure that the blocksize will be raised in the future, the only questions are how much, how soon and in which way.  About this there is substantial disagreement.
Even as a settlement layer, bitcoin will need more capacity than 1MB blocks, but with the planned upcoming improvements, we can already get a lot more users and transaction throughput out of that same 1MB (especially through the lightning network).  
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:47:18
I think you have me confused as a (typical) bigblocker.  I did not say the transactions had to occur in layer 1.
My main issue is that there seems to be a group of bitcoiners who think that bitcoin will remain the default store of value no matter what.  And that therefore a governance model of inaction in absence of overwhelming consensus is always the best.  Yes I want my store of value to be secure, well thought out and not changing at the slightest whim to include the latest fad feature.  However, another crypto that has better scaling can build out a larger network.  If that crypto then becomes sufficiently conservative to be considered a store of value (while being cheaper and/or more widely accepted), why wouldn't I store my value there?  What is then to stop other investors from moving over?  And who exactly wants to keep btc as a "store of value" if it keeps depreciating because of this?  
I still hold the vast majority of my holdings in bitcoin, but we need to recognize that we are in competition on the long term as well, so we need scaling.
