Fuck your shitcoin
@_date: 2014-07-13 12:09:57
I bought one but I'd stay away from targeted products in the future. A worker in China has big motivation to swap the chips as Bitcoin increases
@_date: 2014-07-28 06:59:48
This is the Bitcoin manifesto
@_date: 2014-08-05 11:24:15
Relax that's from like 2011
@_date: 2014-07-29 06:54:56
So bitpay with euro, gold, etc choices. No withdrawal except buy back Bitcoin when you want. Hybrid bitpay Coinbase for consumers. It's what I thought circle would offer. Use Bitcoin as a payment rail without volatility. Your Bitcoin are instantly sold upon deposit.
It's how PayPal etc will work in the future, sending Bitcoin in the back end.
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:40:10
Yeah wait for circle

Xapo is a shady lying sack of shit. His last company lemon.com tricked life lock into buying it then they had to shut it down because it was full of holes and useless. The owner is a con artist.
I also do not believe he raised any money, they're all lies to get exposure.

@_date: 2014-07-21 14:42:06
Use authenticator plus

This will get them thousands of free bitcoins

Export your private keys to blockchain then never use that address again which armory usually makes you do anyway
@_date: 2014-07-28 05:23:32
2 you always need the password, a paper wallet or encrypted key isn't magically decrypted unless you import it then it's stored in that program
@_date: 2014-07-15 11:06:15
Sounds like identity theft

This is the one
@_date: 2014-07-05 13:34:48
No not when offline
@_date: 2014-07-22 12:59:19
Then lie like everyone else
@_date: 2014-07-07 02:09:44
Many sellers have been selling fake equipment
@_date: 2014-08-03 09:58:34
You better do it offline
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:50:22
They're scared like all shills
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:22:57
Sadly the app stores Ban gambling

@_date: 2014-07-26 06:35:13
They'll get what's coming
@_date: 2014-08-10 03:34:46
No point with merge mining

They're cool but getting expensive and images barely ever work anymore

But this app is a joke, it's not even trying, their only chance at this point is Bitcoin. Even Google has a nice app but it's still a failure

There are many trolls in here 247, so you can conclude it's their paid job
@_date: 2014-07-22 06:36:31
Yes but it would be illegal for an isp to block Bitcoin unless Bitcoin became illegal, so vpn is standard practice for any corporation. Even Amazon let's you tap in with a vpn to hide from your isp
All the companies you mentioned encrypt their traffic with a vpn, your isp has no business reading it, they're just a dumb pipe

New York and cuomo also killed Usenet! 
 
We shut down our newsgroups servers back in 2008, as did Sprint and Verizon, in part due to an aggressive program from New York State Attorney General (now Governor) Andrew Cuomo to eliminate sources of child pornography. I managed to dig up an old CNET article about the decision here: 
 
Of course, we recognize that there are plenty of legitimate uses for Usenet, although its popularity has decreased sharply over the past few years. Unofficially, I would speculate that the cost of maintaining the servers vs. the low percentage of customers who actually use them necessitated a shutdown from a business perspective.
 
I'm not aware of any major ISPs in the USA that still host Usenet mirrors, although there are plenty of small providers who provide access for a small monthly fee.

I think what's getting people is trying to avoid $10k like a guy just did. Then they have to ban him and file a suspicious report vs a transaction report

Honestly he's not going to get a good reading like this. I wouldn't buy from a ghost site. Add to the main one or not. Don't be ashamed from Bitcoin and hide it like you're cheating. It looks shady.

You aren't getting it, they sell your coins then buy them back when you want them, they're locked to the asset value not Bitcoin
It's important for people who want to use Bitcoin as a currency, they get 0 volatility. Not everyone is a mugu that can actually use Bitcoin as an investment
@_date: 2014-08-05 11:33:38
Trucoin? 
@_date: 2014-07-12 11:29:29
Aren't you required to mine even when sending a fake block? Otherwise you can't sign it

@_date: 2014-08-05 11:25:39
Yeah price has to substantially go up if it's going to be used for payments and investments. Otherwise there won't be enough.

While we guarantee the exchange rate as long as the purchaser pays within such time window, you agree that you assume the volatility risk of your local currency or Bitcoin, as applicable. For instance, if you ask us to collect USD $150, and the purchaser sends the payment within the time window, we guarantee you will receive exactly USD $150, minus our fee, but do not guarantee the value of the U.S. dollar.

Good service, watch out for cash advance fee which is $10 for me which is ok for big purchases. Watch out if you carry a balance, you'll get fucked with the cash advance interest that can't even be paid off until you pay off the rest of your balance.

New York and cuomo also killed Usenet! 
 
We shut down our newsgroups servers back in 2008, as did Sprint and Verizon, in part due to an aggressive program from New York State Attorney General (now Governor) Andrew Cuomo to eliminate sources of child pornography. I managed to dig up an old CNET article about the decision here: 
 
Of course, we recognize that there are plenty of legitimate uses for Usenet, although its popularity has decreased sharply over the past few years. Unofficially, I would speculate that the cost of maintaining the servers vs. the low percentage of customers who actually use them necessitated a shutdown from a business perspective.
 
I'm not aware of any major ISPs in the USA that still host Usenet mirrors, although there are plenty of small providers who provide access for a small monthly fee.

It's a double sided coin, alienate us too much and we'll just rebel and go under ground. I'm willing to comply with a compromise but if the regulations don't change then I'm going dark.

Idk but more cheap coins for me. Plus imagine if the price just keeps going up, newbies would get scared off. Right now is a fair entry point giving everyone a chance to join without feeling like they weren't early enough. This price allows distribution

No Litecoin will not succeed if Bitcoin fails. These coins are not "diversifying" your portfolio.
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:06:29
They need plausible deniability with Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-07-16 11:05:21
They're a fraud

These restrictions come from our banking partners, and so sadly we
have no flexibility here. It's frustrating for us to have to turn away
businesses, but in this case our hands our tied. You'll receive
transfers for any payments you've received, but you won't be able to
accept any further payments for this business using Stripe.
Best of luck with your business going forward, and please let me know
if you have any questions about our policies.

In an attempt to secure their future, steamboat interests successfully lobbied to place restrictions on bridge construction, requiring spans and heights previously unheard of. Ostensibly this would maintain sufficient operating room for steamboats beneath the bridge’s base for the then foreseeable future. The unproclaimed purpose was to require a bridge so grand and lofty that it would be impossible to erect according to conventional building techniques. The steamboat parties planned to prevent any structure from being built, in order to ensure continued dependence on river traffic to sustain commerce in the region.

Remember, a 1% fee reduction can mean a 100% increase in profits for microscopic margin companies which most are.
