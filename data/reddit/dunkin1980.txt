how is that? There is nothing special about bitcoin other than the fact than it was FIRST and has provided incentives to keep the blockchain going. 
Why will it continue to outperform other than acceptance? Blockchain is still the engine that makes bitcoin go. Explain how I might be wrong.

not a great analogy there. More like forget cars, remember engines. Blockchain makes bitcoin and other such things feasible. It is the engine that makes the hunk of metal (coin metaphor also) go

The column quotes Dimon "You can't make a currency out of thin air." really, because tons of govts are Printing currency out of thin air and devaluing the peoples' savings. 
[how corrupt governments drive the adoption of bitcoin.]( that is WHY people are accepting bitcoin as a currency!!

a currency is just that. Cash, money, easily exchangeable. 
Yes, this is slightly different as ethereum can run programs etc. but as it is right now, Bitcoin is just a means of exchange.

Fiat currencies are disparate because of geography/ government. The euro has simplified things (largely in Europe) versus all the currencies which used to exist. 
The same walls that help enable different fiats do not exist for crypto

this is a Long article, but I'd be curious if people can counter it, and an update of where we are today. Will Western Union be put out of business, or go on for the next decade?

column explains why corrupt governments are spurring bitcoin adoption. A little tongue in cheek.
