"The owner of AC Bitcoin is a former federal employee who worked on anti-terrorism and security programs and took early retirement to work on Bitcoin.  According to the formal Administrative Ruling miners do not have to register with FinCEN as previously thought as long as they mine for themselves.
AC Bitcoin had frequent contact with FinCEN staff and pointed out that if FinCEN had required miners to register they would need to comply with the “Administrative Procedures Act” which would require them to consider public comments before making the requirement."

Bitgo has more security than bitfinex employed. My guess is they wanted the cheaper security for their exchange overhead. They chose the 2 of 3 key model, which is cheapest. Bitgo recommends companies and more parties than a personal wallet to take 3 of 5 or more keys. Recall, this is designed to be trustless. So if bitfinex chose 3 of 5 for example then bitgo has a key, bitfinex has one at their hot wallet, and one in cold storage, and the user has a key, with a backup. Then bitfinex, bitgo and the user each have to provide a key to move coin. If bitfinex is concerned about the user pulling funds out, they could use the 3 of 5 model, but destroy one of the keys, so bitgo has a key, the user has a key, and bitfinex has 2 keys, and it would still take each party to provide a key, or bitfinex and bitgo to provide their keys.

The news was released to members via a post today, and comes as the community at large appears to be shifting to a larger blocksize consensus.
“Exciting times are ahead for this organization,” the post reads.
The half-million-dollar donation came from “donors who represent the on-chain scaling community,” and allows Bitcoin Unlimited to transform its structure and future plans.
“Our donors share our belief about what Bitcoin is and should remain: a global peer-to-peer currency, with affordable fees, scalable and available for universal usage,” the post continues.
The shake-up will first take the form of a legislative move: Bitcoin Unlimited will register as an official non-profit organization in the US to “formalize its presence and assist with future public relations initiatives” and foster the prospect of further donations.
Also unveiled was the second of the soon-to-be non-profit’s scaling conferences, the first of which was an online-only event but which will now take a physical form.
The second event “will draw together developers, users and Bitcoin businesses.”
The mood in the Bitcoin community at large appears to be shifting to welcoming the idea of larger block sizes universally.

[the answer]
 
Bitcoin software is not designed to share a key 
Another important note, it is important not to use a private key simultaneously with the Bitcoin software and other online wallets. This practice is considered experimental and may cause operational problems with the Bitcoin sofware. If a problem occurs after this mistake, it is be necessary to export the private keys, reinstall Bitcoin and re-import private keys. 
Open your Bitcoin software. 
Click on the menu Help / Debug window (at the top). 
Click on the Console tab. 
If your wallet is encrypted, type the following command followed by the Enter key to unlock the wallet 
walletpassphrase (password) 600 
Type the following command to export the key 
dumpprivkey (Bitcoin address) 
The private key is shown on the screen.

So first off how many parties have to do something to redeem them. Secondly are the keys encrypted somehow.
If is is done with redemption script, what are the conditions for redeeming the coin?
The reason I say this is says up to 5 people have to cosign it. If all it takes is 3 people to co sign it, you all could just log in and sign the coins out right now.

'Testnet is fine, if you're running Bitcoin Core'
The answer or solution is to reduce the difficulty so that it takes 5 minutes on average to find a block. The same date and time approx the next halving occurs will be the same. This will also allow faster confirmation times on average.
Which miner wouldn't want to make it easier to find a block?
This will of course result in more bitcoins over the long run being produced, but in the short term it won't matter, as there are many variables that determine price.
In case you are wondering how this solves the problem, you get 2 blocks at 1 meg in a ten minute period, instead of 1, so it is 2 megs max per 10 minute period.
Looks like this is set in wallets running the network checking.
this one could be changed, but I doubt the rest could.

My name is Ted Rogers and I am the SVP for Business Development at Xapo.
With the help of Willis Insurance, I've spent the last several months putting together the insurance product for the Xapo Vault. Bitcoin is a new thing for the insurance industry, obviously, but with the help of Willis and our partners at Benchmark, Fortress and Ribbit Capital, we were able to construct an insurance policy that fully insures all the bitcoins stored in our Vault.
Hi -- this is Ted Rogers from Xapo. I appreciate the concern of the OP and others on this thread, and I thought it might be helpful to provide some context.
Xapo has moved its corporate headquarters to Switzerland. The first step was mainly a legal process: Xapo Gmbh has been duly incorporated and our corporate restructuring is being completed. The second step is operational: hiring staff and getting them trained and onboarded. We have already hired key administrative personnel in Switzerland, including local company representatives accountants and attorneys, but the selection and staffing of excellent operational personnel will take longer.
Our goal over the coming months is making sure that quality service to our users is maintained and, ideally, enhanced.

It may not be needed to do a hard fork, it depends on how you code the change. I noticed a few days ago people were claiming tx were taking a long time to confirm, this is an example of what would happen if people did more tx, as there are now many many more users than there were 2 years ago. I myself don't like traffic jams, so we need more lanes on the highway. Most of the miners agree they would increase blocksize, so it is something that will happen once a correct coding of it is set up and practiced on testnet to ensure it is viable. So if there is something wrong with testnet now, then they need to get on fixing testnet first, and then decide on the proper code for the blocksize change.
I also notice that some are quite falsely claiming the fee of a tx would go up if blocksize increases. This is flase. There will be more fees collected by miners for a block, but that is because there will be more tx in a block.
If there were 1,000 tx in a block and 10 cent fee per tx on average, that is $100 in fees. If there were 2,500 tx in a block averaging 10 cents per tx, that would $250 in fees for the miner per block, so overall fees collected goes up for a miner, but the cost to send a tx is the same as it has always been.

Bitfinex stated recently that they had limits set at bitgo. Bitgo has not disputed this. The amount transacted was over the limits, yet Bitgo says they were not compromised at all. I do not know how Bitgo sets their limit, whether it is checked internally at their own systems, or based on data traffic from the internet as to the amount. At that point, if it is data traffic altered, it is the govt. If it is an internal check, it is someone at bitgo. Now how do i know if it was internal it is US govt?
Simple: I was in discussion with bitgo recently about some issues with my accounts, and various wallets I have on those accounts.
A recent wallet i created I was forced to have my log in password, and the wallet passcode set to be identical. The reason why they are supposed to be different is so bitgo does not have the encryption to the wallet keys. If the passcode is the same as the log in password, then some employee at bitgo could swipe the coins in that wallet. The reason why I think it is govt, is I am under Govt surveillance and the data was altered en route to force me to make them the same. How the govt subverted the PFS is my data was routed through their server, so between the govt server and bitgo was PFS, but from the govt server to me was non PFS, and they modified the page by data packet dropping, and then resending the altered data packets. So the govt wanted my wallet password and log in password the same, so THEIR GOVT PLANT AT BITGO COULD SWIPE MY WALLET COINS AT THEIR WHIM.
IOW, THE GOVT HAS AN EMPLOYEE AT BITGO.

 the prefix "0x" is widespread due to its use in Unix and C (and related operating systems and languages). Alternatively, some authors denote hexadecimal values using a suffix or subscript. For example, one could write 0x2AF3 or 2AF316, depending on the choice of notation
Each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits), and the primary use of hexadecimal notation is a human-friendly representation of binary-coded values in computing and digital electronics. One hexadecimal digit represents a nibble, which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). For example, byte values can range from 0 to 255 (decimal), but may be more conveniently represented as two hexadecimal digits in the range 00 to FF

Let’s test our code. Following the same example from the Bitcoin wiki, the hex address 00010966776006953D5567439E5E39F86A0D273BEED61967F6 should be 16UwLL9Risc3QfPqBUvKofHmBQ7wMtjvM in Base58Check.
$ racket
Welcome to Racket v6.0.0.3.
-&gt; (require "base58.rkt")
-&gt; (hex-str-&gt;base58-str.v0 "00010966776006953D5567439E5E39F86A0D273BEED61967F6")
Our initial attempt produces the wrong answer! What happened? It turns out that the leading zeros in a hex string matter when the string is viewed as a Bitcoin address. But when we converted to base–10, the leading zeros got dropped since they don’t matter for numbers.
To fix the base–58 conversion, following the Bitcoin reference code, we count the number of leading zeros in the hex string and add one leading ‘1’ character to the base–58 address for each leading zero byte in the hex string, ie, we add one leading base–58 ‘1’ per two leading hex ’0’s. Here’s an updated conversion function:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
(define (count-leading-zeros str)
  (for/sum ([c (in-string str)]  (not (char=?  c))) 1))
; converts base10 number to base58check string
(define (num-&gt;base58-str n) 
  (if (zero? n) "" (num-&gt;base58-str.v0 n)))
; converts hex string to base58check string
(define (hex-str-&gt;base58-str hstr)
  (define num-leading-ones (quotient (count-leading-zeros hstr) 2))
  (define leading-ones (make-string num-leading-ones 
  (string-append leading-ones (num-&gt;base58-str (hex-str-&gt;num hstr))))
Trying our example again yields the expected result:
$ racket
Welcome to Racket v6.0.0.3.
-&gt; (require "base58.rkt")
-&gt; (hex-str-&gt;base58-str "00010966776006953D5567439E5E39F86A0D273BEED61967F6")

They sign so many messages apparently there is zero way to make sure it is them.
The way they can fix this is they ask you for the message that they are going to sign.

This BIP describes a new type of Bitcoin address to support arbitrarily complex transactions. Complexity in this context is defined as what information is needed by the recipient to respend the received coins, in contrast to needing a single ECDSA private key as in current implementations of Bitcoin.
In essence, an address encoded under this proposal represents the encoded hash of a script, rather than the encoded hash of an ECDSA public key.
Enable "end-to-end" secure wallets and payments to fund escrow transactions or other complex transactions. Enable third-party wallet security services.
Signature operations in the {serialized script} shall contribute to the maximum number allowed per block (20,000) as follows:
OP_CHECKSIG and OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY count as 1 signature operation, whether or not they are evaluated.
OP_CHECKMULTISIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY immediately preceded by OP_1 through OP_16 are counted as 1 to 16 signature operation, whether or not they are evaluated.
All other OP_CHECKMULTISIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY are counted as 20 signature operations.
+3 signature operations:
    {2 [pubkey1] [pubkey2] [pubkey3] 3 OP_CHECKMULTISIG}
+22 signature operations
    {OP_CHECKSIG OP_IF OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY OP_ELSE OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY OP_ENDIF}
As a consequence of the requirement for backwards compatiblity the serialized script is itself subject to the same rules as any other PUSHDATA operation, including the rule that no data greater than 520 bytes may be pushed to the stack.

I even use pay to script on testnet:
@_date: 2016-08-20 18:21:15
from the top
The function assumes that the input private key is in hex, and returned public key is in hex as well. I had to first convert the private key to BIGNUM, which is OpenSSL’s number representation for arbitrary precision arithmetic. The computed public key is an OpenSSL EC_POINT data structure, which represents a curve coordinate. The curve coordinate is converted back to hex using EC_POINT_point2hex. Public keys can either be compressed or uncompressed, and the format of the output of priv2pub depends on the form input parameter, which can be one of three values.
To test this function, I found a sample public/private key pair from this Bitcoin wiki article. The private key from the article is 18E14A7B6A307F426A94F8114701E7C8E774E7F9A47E2C2035DB29A206321725 and the public key is 0450863AD64A87AE8A2FE83C1AF1A8403CB53F53E486D8511DAD8A04887E5B23522CD470243453A299FA9E77237716103ABC11A1DF38855ED6F2EE187E9C582BA6. The public key begins with 0x04 so we know it’s in uncompressed form (see section 2.3.3) and is 65 bytes long (see ANSI X9.62 for more details).
I used the following main function to test if priv2pub can compute the public key using the private key from the example:
Let’s try another example. I generated a private key with bitaddress.org, 5JQZaZrYCbJ1Kb96vFBMEefrQGuNfHSqbHbviC3URUNGJ27frFe, but it’s in Base58Check encoding and not hex. We’ll deal with Base58 encoding later so for now I went to the “Wallet Details” tab at bitaddress.org, entered the base58 key, and found that the private key in hex is 4DD3D47E491C5D34F9540EBF3444E3D6675015A46B61AF37B4EB7F17DDDF4E61 and the public key is 0492EDC09A7311C2AB83EF3D133331D7B73117902BB391D9DAC3BE261547F571E171F16775DDA6D09A6AAF1F3F6E6AA3CFCD854DCAA6AED0FA7AF9A5ED9965E117. Let’s check what our code says:
$ ./priv2pub 4DD3D47E491C5D34F9540EBF3444E3D6675015A46B61AF37B4EB7F17DDDF4E61
To test our wrapper functions, let’s see if we can duplicate this example from the Bitcoin wiki, which shows how to convert a Bitcoin private key into a public address. We covered how to derive a public key from a private key in a previous post, so we start with the public key here.
For ease of comparison, here’s the sequence of expected hashes, copied from the Bitcoin wiki example:
public key: 0450863AD64A87AE8A2FE83C1AF1A8403CB53F53E486D8511DAD8A04887E5B23522CD470243453A299FA9E77237716103ABC11A1DF38855ED6F2EE187E9C582BA6
SHA–256: 600FFE422B4E00731A59557A5CCA46CC183944191006324A447BDB2D98D4B408
RIPEMD–160: 010966776006953D5567439E5E39F86A0D273BEE
prepend 0x00: 00010966776006953D5567439E5E39F86A0D273BEE
SHA–256: 445C7A8007A93D8733188288BB320A8FE2DEBD2AE1B47F0F50BC10BAE845C094
SHA–256 (checksum is first 4 bytes): D61967F63C7DD183914A4AE452C9F6AD5D462CE3D277798075B107615C1A8A30
step 4 result + checksum = (hex) address: 00010966776006953D5567439E5E39F86A0D273BEED61967F6
The hashes are all in hexdecimal form so we extend our hash functions to convert to and from hex strings (bytes-&gt;hex-string and hex-string-&gt;bytes are built-in Racket functions):
(define (sha256/hex input)
  (bytes-&gt;hex-string (sha256 (hex-string-&gt;bytes input))))
(define (ripemd160/hex input)
  (bytes-&gt;hex-string (ripemd160 (hex-string-&gt;bytes input))))
Now we can duplicate the sequence of hashes from the example, using the code from this post (saved to a file crypto.rkt) and the Racket (extended) REPL (the ^ token in the REPL represents the last printed result):
The final result is the Bitcoin address from the example, in hexadecimal format. The Bitcoin wiki article performs one more step to convert to Base58Check encoding, which is the standard representation for Bitcoin addresses. We’ll look at Base58Check encoding in the next post!

Next it comes down to how an employee there could pull it off. The theft took place in under 19 minutes. So they would coincide with employee break time amount. So an employee does not take break when everybody else does. Then it comes down to how they currently teach people quite stupidly how to code in the first place. See, back in 1979, people wrote code any way they wanted to obfuscate what the code does, not so anymore. They use object oriented, readability, and variable and function call names that say exactly what they do. So let us imagine what they names the function call:
ACTT_LIMIT_CHECK 
See what the problem is here? The upper case I looks like lower case L.
So the employee alters the name by changing the letter to look like it is still fine, and informs the govt actor in the heist with them, they are on break, limit subverted.
Wait til break is over and they are on the way back back: break is over limit restored.
Upon a glance by higher ups, everything would look at a glance perfectly fine:

See, if some cop stole millions of diamonds while investigating jewelry sales, he would be thrown in prison.
But this pig has a puppet judge and no one will arrest him for his thuggery and crimes.
His goal is to move into bitcoin, which will make people leave it of course, thusly destroying it entirely.
He moves the coins daily, and it is to known nodes on the blockchain miners, if the authorities wanted to catch the person, it is trivial, but you notice nothing happens.
Let me know if you want any further info on this individual, such as identity etc.
And don't fall for his faking his own death ploy, I can spot him under any circumstances to know it is him.

Using simple techniques it is possible to reduce the amount of bandwidth necessary to propagate new blocks to full nodes when they already share much of the same mempool contents. Peers send compact block “sketches” to receiving peers. These sketches include the following information:
The 80-byte header of the new block
header	Block header	80 bytes	First 80 bytes of the block as defined by the encoding used by "block" messages	The header of the block being provided
nonce	uint64_t	8 bytes	Little Endian	A nonce for use in short transaction ID calculations
shortids_length	CompactSize	1 or 3 bytes	As used to encode array lengths elsewhere	The number of short transaction IDs in shortids (ie block tx count - prefilledtxn_length)
shortids	List of 6-byte integers	6*shortids_length bytes	Little Endian	The short transaction IDs calculated from the transactions which were not provided explicitly in prefilledtxn
prefilledtxn_length	CompactSize	1 or 3 bytes	As used to encode array lengths elsewhere	The number of prefilled transactions in prefilledtxn (ie block tx count - shortids_length)
prefilledtxn	List of PrefilledTransactions	variable size*prefilledtxn_length	As defined by PrefilledTransaction definition, above	Used to provide the coinbase transaction and a select few which we expect a peer may be missing

This was butterfly labs, they hashed much more than that.
Try again, this isn't 1972:
In fact, once it worked, it was a little anticlimactic. I typed in the command and the bash prompt to kick the miner off. Rather than spitting out an error like it had been doing, the screen lit up in a deliciously cryptic display
Numbers. Lots of numbers everywhere. I stared at it for long seconds, watching the updates crawl upward from the bottom of the screen. Am I actually mining? I wondered. Is money happening? I envisioned my little MacBook Air lighting up like a slot machine if I found an actual block. Would sirens go off? Would money shoot out?
I quickly shared a screenshot with the rest of the Ars team in IRC. "IS THIS GOOD?!" I asked. No one really knew.
I kept staring at the numbers, not yet willing to glance at bfgminer's documentation to see what they meant. All I knew is that there were lots of counters and things on my screen, and I wanted them to be higher. I had a sudden flashback to my first job out of college in 2000, when I dragged 20 unused Pentium II PCs into a corner and rigged them all up with the SETI client and briefly became an ET-searching superstar.
I had done it. I had legitimately mined bitcoins and transmuted raw electricity into dollars, through the power of mathematics. Truly, my skill knew no bounds!
But the story doesn't quite end there.
You might wonder, dear reader, why I stopped at 2.90220929 bitcoins. It's rather an odd number. Why not three? Why not four or five?

I see you fail to distinguish the difference between something impossible and something extremely difficult ...
The Rebound Attack is a type of statistical attack on hash functions, using techniques such as rotational and differential cryptanalysis to find collisions and other interesting properties.
The basic idea of the attack is to observe a certain differential characteristic in a block cipher (or in a part of it), a permutation or another type of primitive. Finding values fulfilling the characteristic is achieved by splitting the primitive {\displaystyle E} E into three parts such that {\displaystyle E=E_{fw}\circ E_{in}\circ E_{bw}} E=E_{{fw}}\circ E_{{in}}\circ E_{{bw}}. {\displaystyle E_{in}} E_{in} is called the inbound phase and {\displaystyle E_{fw}} E_{{fw}} and {\displaystyle E_{bw}} E_{{bw}} together are called the outbound phase. The attacker then chooses values that realize part of the differential characteristic in the inbound phase deterministically, and fulfill the remainder of the characteristic in a probabilistic manner.
Thus, the rebound attack consists of 2 phases:
The inbound (or match-in-the-middle) phase, covers the part of the differential characteristic that is difficult to satisfy in a probabilistic way. The goal here is to find many solutions for this part of the characteristic with a low average complexity. To achieve this, the corresponding system of equations, which describes the characteristic in this phase, should be underdetermined. When searching for a solution, there are therefore many degrees of freedom, giving many possible solutions. The inbound phase may be repeated several times to obtain a sufficient number of starting points so that the outbound phase is likely to succeed.
In the outbound phase each solution of the inbound phase is propagated outwards in both directions, while checking whether the characteristic also holds in this phase. The probability of the characteristic in the outbound phase should be as high as possible.
The advantage of using an inbound and two outbound phases is the ability to calculate the difficult parts of the differential characteristic in the inbound phase in an efficient way. Furthermore, it ensures a high probability in the outbound phase. The overall probability of finding a differential characteristic thus becomes higher than using standard differential techniques.

Funny how other subs have my comment and post count all highly positive except here.
If I get banned from here from your fake votes, maybe I should a pull fast one like you and use another nym?
The rule here is suppose to be, one person one voice.
makes me wonder if you and your minions here have a stranglehold around here for some purpose.
Are you going to claim anyone who points this out is some obvious troll, look at their history, you gigantic troll?
(and that goes for every other nym you have, you seem to make them up by merely snapping your fingers).
(maybe you are just the biggest destructive troll the internet has ever seen)
(trying to force the entire internet to your defective, low level mentality so you can be in charge of everything?)
(IOW, how many holes do you have in your head?)
(maybe we shouldn't be allowed to point this out, so that the internet gravitates to the lowest common denominator so you can pretend like you have the normal capacity of a human brain, instead of being cockroach brain level, as you are ...)

Funny how I pointed out a one satoshi discrepency, and you start thinking this. So let us see where that leads to, shall we?
On top of the cost of electricity issue, burning old coins gives a metric known as bitcoin days destroyed, which may have an effect on price of the bitcoin itself.
So because I mention a one satoshi discrepency, you concoct a plan, that everyone has to go along with, because you reason they will get richer if they do this.
So between your thefts and anyone burning their coins to reduce the value of them, and no more being mined, you now imagine a plan to destroy bitcoin.
Is that what you daydream about as you go around trolling the internet from your chair?

here is the world champ solving the megaminx in around 40 seconds.
I need to upgrade to this newer cube.
Hopefully I will get one for my Bday coming up.
In case you don't know what a megaminx is, it is a 12 faced and has 5 sides to a face. Essentially 2 rubiks cubes stacked together, instead of 4 sides to a face, 5 sides.
Don't ask how many combos there are to it, is it a BIG_NUM

Sure. Encourage everyone to broadcast their ip right to the govt directly and save them some work.
There are enough miners with hashrate to ensure no one can take over the network.

'improve scaling by removing a quadratic-scaling signature verification issue'
Their math is ridiculous. The computers are improving over time, it is trivial to validate tx on newer computers. Don't fall for this segwit deception, all it is is a backdoor for the govt to commit theft, fraud, and counterfeiting whenever it wants, all so core developers get to go do their lightning network.
The current nodes that are run by the govt will implement it, then it will spread across the blockchain, and inevitably ruin and destroy bitcoin entirely.
If classic is implemented on mainnet, it will fork out the govt nodes attempting to hijack bitcoin to its ruin and save the entire project.

The scalability issue is just a bandwidth issue, and not a bitcoin protocol issue.
There will not be a change to the protocol to allow the govt to step in over what is really a bandwidth issue.
I think outside the box, for example, if you break the block submissions into 2 parts, the header with nonce, followed by the txs themselves, this will allow miners to get credit for their hashing.
With 2 blocks submitted with the header only, the second can't relay their transactions until the first finishes their upload.

If you use a reusable CC, someone else could in theory use it.
