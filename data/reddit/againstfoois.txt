non-minable = pre-mined, insta-mined. With very few exceptions.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:30:55
Well it depends on the transaction fee. Every single channel you open would cost you a transaction fee. 
You need to open a channel not only with every major node but with the little subnodes as well so you can have the shortest route for anyone.
I imagine as the network grows exponentially and if the transaction fees go up again it will be pretty expensive to do that.

Except tether can create a billion USDT today and just sell them on bitfinex for Bitcoin.
coinbase can’t do that with their internal USD holdings because in order to get one dollar they need to buy one dollar worth of crypto not just promise you they have that dollar worth of crypto. 
Coinbase allows purchases and withdrawals in cash, tether only allows buys.
See the difference?

Not sure what you mean there. A few weeks ago transaction fees were pretty high. I’m aware you can set a lower transaction fee and still get it confirmed but you’d have to wait longer. But even the lowest transaction fees were pretty high a few weeks ago.
Opening hundreds/thousands of channels even at a few dollars per transaction will be pretty expensive. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:38:59
2 dollars a day when price was 50 = 4%
20 dollars a day when the price was 400 = 4%

Misleading title
“Nasdaq (NDAQ) is reviewing ways to offer cryptocurrency futures that operate differently from those offered by Cboe (CBOE) and CME Group (CME), CNBC reports, citing CEO Adena Friedman.
“We are continuing to investigate the idea of a cryptocurrency futures with a partner and we continue to look at the risk management around that, making sure we are putting the right protocols in place, making sure there’s proper demand, and that the contract is different from what’s already out there,” Friedman told CNBC.
“What we might look at is more of a total return futures, so it’s a little bit of a different construct,” adding that it meant it was “more of an investment than a tracking stock.””

yes and your 100 dollar SEPA transfer will affect the price a lot!   /s
I've been saying this for a while, all these posts: "wait till monday when banks open", "wait till friday until people get their paychecks", "xmas money (the 50 bucks your grandma gave you ? )" etc.
This is bitcoin, whales pump BILLIONS every day, your SEPA transfer and all the combined SEPA transfers don't affect shit other than spreading FUD when the price drops with piggy bank change investments.
The rest of the world controls 80% of the crypto world, "the holidays and xmas in december" don't even exist in china and korea.

That’s initial investment for 1 bitcoin. After that first day you already have all your antminers so it’s just profit from there for years minus the electricity.

Haha, keep telling yourself that. The days of bitcoin mining on a pc are gone.
You will never be able to mine 50 bitcoins every day like the early adopters did.
Also I doubt we will ever see a bitcoin worth cents only to increase 19000x.
Even if bitcoin reaches 100k you will still be only 5 dollars a day and by that time your PC won’t even make a cent a day. 
It’s more profitable to put the electricity money and the extra money you spend on a video card buying the actual coin not mining it.

This can be done except the mining part that will reward you real coins. In your example with a decent smartphone you will probably mine 5 bucks worth of monero a year 24/7.
It can be made if I create my own coin that will be mined solely on smartphones and if the game becomes very popular so will the coin. The problem with this is that I want to help bitcoin not other cryptocurrencies. Second problem, even if I wanted to do this it would take more than one person to create a game like that.

The bitcoin price there is 9558.
Two offers to sell bitcoin with Zelle with the highest one being 9175, and the lowest one, a measly 8602 with Chase quick pay.
At the same time the price on coinbase is 9767 and you can sell it for 9730 in one second, which one is more superior?

And that’s news how?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:10:35
what? 
haha, dude, you ran out of arguments. we are talking about exchanges here, the BTC has to be exchanged from USD first.

I’ll look into it. This will probably take me a month or two, depending on how much free time I have. I think it would be great to have something were you can check a coefficient of FUD level based on all these attacks and be informed of what can happen next. 
I’ll need help finding sources of information for the attacks that have already occurred.
Also if anyone has any ideas about the presentation of all this.. (a pie chart, graph, table, etc).
Lastly, if anyone attempts to create this, how would you make sure that the info is not biased? (Create a voting system, assign mods that can edit the data, source reference everything, etc)
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:40:37
What’s the error? 
@_date: 2019-06-04 04:09:01
nope, keep it high to prevent jealous people from vandalizing the QR code, or dogs peeing on it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:09
yeah right, you are dreaming bud

I think you should mention that it's $8.33 a day, most people will think it's per hour.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:30:44
Well you can build unlimited copies of the blockchain and market it as the next best thing (altcoins), so what’s your point? 
If bitcoin is scarce and too messy, other coins will succeed.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:11:50
They will start by going through his comment history to see if they can find some info, where he lives, what he likes, what school he has attended, job, etc. 
With this info they can get something as minor as passing the security answers to recover a password, or they can find his real name, where he lives, other websites he visits and his login name to those websites. (nickname)
If they find the nickname for other websites now they doubled their chances of hacking the password, bonus points if they find his email address, triple points if they find his phone number that he used to set up 2 factor auth, quadruple points if they find his ip address of the computer he stores the coins on, etc. 
Then if they are not successful at hacking his password, they will start targeting his email with phishing scams.
The point of all this is that people share a lot of info online, more than they realize. You probably use the same nickname on a ton of websites and it's easy to get more info about you. All a hacker needs to start targeting you is your email and your IP address.

what is "this"? your pic is down, use your words man :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:56:14
You can never have it all. 
You hear about coinbase everywhere now because that’s what most of us use to buy bitcoin. 
It’s very hard for them to scale and employ expert IT that will fix everything in a day when less than a year ago they were just a little exchange.
They are FDIC insured don’t compare them to MTGox.
Remember when....peperidge farm remembers. Satoshi’s vision was written 8 years ago, he has never revised it and bitcoin is a different animal now.
Steve Jobs vision was no never have a stylus and never has a bigger screen than 4 inches, would they have survived if they listened to that shit? 
What’s your favorite exchange? Lets make that one more popular and see how it crashes on days like this. As a matter of fact they all crashed during the last few days. 
And tbh they are all banks because they all work directly with banks to take your money and give you a “balance” of a digital currency that you don’t really physically own. 
How do you propose millions of people buy bitcoin without an exchange? 
Start your own exchange and be our savior.

Grow up kid
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:17:40
It’s just a flash crash of the api or the database itself, it happens pretty often on coinbase too. 
You can’t really buy anything while it happens. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:43:41
what you call "volume going up" is actually the product of everyone panic selling triggering stop losses. Outside these spikes the volume stabilizes and remains the same as it was before the panic started.

still don't get your point.
Yes, people are not that optimist anymore. 
All the bad news from this week are still valid, they didn't just disappear. 
This was a good bounce but it didn't last.
 I will not touch bitcoin until in reaches 13k again. If we are meant to go to 100k this year, 13k would be a good entry point. 
The charts are saying that we are going lower.

I'm not sure you know what open source software means. 
A github project is like a cloud file that you make public and share with the world. 
Everyone is allowed to make modifications to your file, when someone does, the modifications are stored as a "new version" of the file. 
The old version still exists and everyone using the old version gets to decide if they like the changes you made and if they want to switch to the new version. 
If a core developer releases a new version of the file, the network trusts them more because they are the legitimate core developers of the network. If at any point the network decides not to trust the developers they get to stay on the old version of the file or create their own version an go along with that, aka bcash.

Coonbase is Devil, coonbase is that, get over yourself “BTC Trader”.
You can clearly see on your bank statement that the withdrawals are going back to the registered coinbase account number not an outsider.
Fucking professionals on this sub...smh

@_date: 2018-02-05 19:29:00
There’s no support at 6k. It’s at 5k and at 2.5k. 
I doubt it will go lower than that.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:00:12
charts are worthless in bitcoin.
If you are really good at crypto charts, you can only predict a few hours ahead and that's pretty much what day traders and the bots are doing. 
Anything past that and you are in palm reading psychics territory.
Whales will be whales and FUD will be FUD, you can't predict that.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:08:18
Mk, I’ll just wait and buy it at 17k
If it’s supposed to go to 50k this year, 3x is still good.
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:34:29
How is it a 43% correction? 
Or the flash crashes don’t count?
19600-7600=12000.       62% correction
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:14:25
7k is too low. I say 7.2-7.4k by 4pm.
And if it does hit 7.2k, buy immediately, it will bounce back to 8k, as soon as it does, sell.
That’s how whales make money when it dips. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:50:08
And they were right....every single time.
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:27:22
"psychological barriers" - they aren't really barriers if they were already broken before. We are still a long way to catch up to the ATH, the next real barrier is the ATH. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:49:56
a shit ton. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:40:43
The crash stopped at -5x. from 1000 to 200.
If the story repeats, it will go from 20k to 4k.
Back then bitcoin had 85% dominance and now it has 33%, it might get even worse than -5x although I doubt that will happen this year unless another coin takes over.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:23:18
Last bottom was below 200 dollars.
History is repeating itself. Judging by the fact that this ATH was over 15 times higher than the last, I’m expecting a 2000 bitcoin this time.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:32:24
Lets not compare the opposite though. You bought low and sold high and all these kids bought high and see the price plummet 70% in less than a month. 
Can you name at least one time in the last two years when bitcoin crashed like that?
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:37:48
he needs more but coin
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:03:51
It’s called a double dip you rookie 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:50:47
Not sure where you are you looking at the charts. 
BTC is still at 33% dominance. 
5% faster is not substantial.
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:57:07
how is it the correct way? Who says so? 
The original world is hold, if hodl has the same root than it should be pronounced the same (hoe-dl). 
And if all the media calls it hoe-dl that's the pronunciation that's going to stick around.
I just call it hold, it's just a misspelled word.

@_date: 2018-02-04 18:47:35
I don't see your point.
You are saying it's ok to lie in order to increase the price?
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:14:10
Calm your tits
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:12:24
I sold at 12k, plenty time to get back in if I feel like it. 
And without the hold mentality, could have made a small fortune if I sold at ATH. 
You want a medal for holding?
Stop spreading this nonsense.
This year proved to everyone that you can’t predict where bitcoin is going to go.
You get all your voices back when bitcoin is rising.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:50:20
because they speculate and sell your coins and create flash crashes and then buy it again once it bottoms out. Of course they don't want to show any bookkeeping. 
Also every time you buy or sell that 20 dollar difference between the minimum and max is never in your advantage.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:39:36
so true. I think until exchanges are not regulated and don't provide some sort of transparency of their holdings, bitcoin will never be a real thing. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:56:32
"SERVICE UNAVAILABLE
Coinbase is currently down for maintenance. Please try again later or see our status page for more information"
So you let us all buy it when it's high but when it's crashing and it's time to speculate they crash.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:55:38
it's not a flash crash.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:01:31
wait what? 
If you bought it from coinbase, you better pray because the site just crashed and is unavailable.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:50:46
yeah I noticed that. I think they should, but I'm pretty sure it's just their servers failing
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:11:36
So where in your story are bitcoins involved?
You mentioned that he sends you “money”. 
In what form? A check?
If it’s a check, it’s a very old scam. 
- Scammer tells they’ll send you 500. But instead you receive a 1500 check. After you mention it to them, they say it was a mistake and that “oh my god” that is bread for their child and you need to send back the extra 1000 in gift cards or western union. A week later, the 1500 check you deposited in your bank that you thought was legit bounces and you are out 1000 dollars plus whatever fee your bank charges for bounced checks.
If he sends you this in bitcoin and you buy back gift cards, most likely this is money laundering and you might be in deep trouble if it’s used for illegal activities that can be traced back to you.
Either way, stop whatever you are doing now and don’t even read his emails.
Contact a lawyer if you can’t sleep at night because of this.
Good luck
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:53:22
Or maybe a slight pull back before the next leg up?
You never know so stop trying to make sense of it. The big guns move the market way ahead of any news so your best bet is to guess.
Haven’t you noticed that after a big jump you later hear hours later some huge good news and vice versa?
Insider trading in bitcoin is not rare. If you see it dropping more than 10%, expect bad news tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-05-31 12:26:23
Nope, i just stated 2 facts and you choose the weaker one to argue.
@_date: 2019-05-31 06:41:54
This argument again...
If people live paycheck to paycheck and wait until Payday to “buy more coins” they are most likely only contributing very small amounts which will not move the price at all.
Besides, US has bimonthly or weekly paychecks so your point is invalid
@_date: 2017-06-18 06:05:05
what kind of math is this?
