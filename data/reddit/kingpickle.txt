Because we propped up the financial institutions. But we didn't do anything to prop up, or ease down, the inflated home prices. We let the bubble burst. So all the normal folks who got suckered into those crazy interest-only loans and such got screwed. We didn't bail them out. We didn't give them 0% loans. On top of that, it caused the economy in general to take a big hit, causing tons of people to lose their jobs, and so on. It had a large ripple effect. So I'd say, even if only indirectly, it affected everyone.
China's stock market was clearly in a bubble. It had gone up a massive amount in a short time. Instead of letting it completely collapse they're propping it up. Clearly, that's not a very "free market" solution. And the sustained value of those stocks are dubious. But I suspect, by not letting it completely crash, there's a lot of average folks who now have time to get out of market, diversify, etc.

I'm not interested in getting into a long-winded argument about my choice of words. Pretend I said instead "our solution still left most people affected by the crisis". Good enough?

Yeah, it's not like here in the USA where we just have bailouts and QE. Oh wait, it sort of is. Except our solution punished everyone instead of just the large stock-holders.
They're both contrived fucked up solutions. But I think it's hard to argue their solution is fundamentally worse.

Bullshit. That's the entire point of regulations.

That escalated quickly!

There's a big difference between weeding out bad regulation and wanting less regulation.
Our goal should be for quality regulation, not less regulation.

Are you serious? 
Overtime pay? Minimum wage? Mandatory breaks for workers after X hours? Emission standards? Noise ordinances? Clean water regulations? Equal employment opportunity? Not getting dropped from your health insurance for pre-existing conditions? And so on...
If I felt like googling it, I could probably come up with hundreds more with very little effort.
