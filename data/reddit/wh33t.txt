How does getting paid in BTC work? As I understand you just give someone your wallet ID and they can transfer basically instantly?
And the block chain which stores all of the accounts and who has what coins is publicly distributed right? Does that mean everyone can see how much bitcoin is in my wallet if I give them my ID?
I've been reading up that my Government (Canada) is sort of accepting BTC as legal tender, at least in the sense that I need to pay taxes on it. I'm still trying to figure out if I want to accept BTC as payment for web and computer work I do. I've had people suggest to me that it opens up another avenue for payment but it sort of irks me a bit.

30-60 minutes! I guess that's excellent turn around time in comparison to a Credit Card, but how could BTC ever rival actual money like debit or cash for every day transactions like gas and groceries if it takes 30 minutes. I suppose as BTC grows the network speeds increase?
1. Curious, why it takes 3-6 confirmations? Why isn't it just a set number?
2. Do I understand that in order to keep my wallet private, I create a new wallet each time I want to get paid that I'll only use once, and then move the money from there into my permanent and anonymous one? Or use an exchange (which sounds an awful lot like a bank) and then withdraw from there? How reliable are these exchanges? Didn't I recently just read that someone stole a bunch of money from a big exchange somewhere?
3. Is there still BTC left to mine and discover? Is it worth getting into Litecoin or any of the cyrptocurrencies out there? Seems like BTC is the gold standard and Litecoin is the silver standard?

What is the difference?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:39:45
Did it drop in value or something?

I'm curious how well bitcoin can function without net neutrality. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 21:37:59
I suppose losing net neutrality would be a huge incentive for everyone to use TOR more often.

Who is benefiting from the increased fees right now?
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:31:40
Well yeah, Windows 10 has this built in and is marketed as a feature!

I don't get it. Something happen to bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-04-07 21:39:52
Does btc not function like torrent or tor? Shouldn't it work like if more people are accepting it as payment the network throughput increases?

What about money gained through illicit means?

I hear ya, but its basically the world reserve currency for black and shadow markets. It will never die on that fact alone. As for become the world currency I'm pretty sure something like zcash or ethereum is more likely to be used.

How can it be a new block chain but also a copy of what was already there? Did they extend it or something?
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:28:41
How does that work? 
So it's not a new block chain? It's just the software that interprets and reads the block chain that has been changed?

Which website was it?

Can someone bring me up to date on this?

My friend just sold $20k worth. I told him he was dumb.
