Sent 50$ to make sure it was legit.
Then sent 400$ in Sept last year. Kinda hard to remember. Seems like a market address, cause I always go to personal wallets first. This time I assumed this was one of my wallets.

I've used programs to clean my computer. I'm afraid all the files were erased permanently.. gonna try a recovery.
B. When I open wallet, I get a choice of which wallet to reopen... usually named wallet1.dat october.dat ... etc.. When I deleted my last wallet, just to try to see if I could re open it, it wasnt a choice. All the old wallets I closed before that are there but the last one just poofed..?

Don't think it won't happen to you one day. If you move a lot and fast you might just lost your game/money.

@_date: 2016-06-04 02:41:42
Man I dont send straight to markets either... thats why i'm fucking so confused. Blockchain showed that 1btc wallet down to 0 very fast. They are reading this now.
@_date: 2016-06-04 04:34:08
No not you... me. Context was bad. Im a fucking idiot.. sorry about that man... smile.
@_date: 2016-06-08 04:40:01
The address I sent to.. the funds are there.
I search my cpu and search that address and it pulls up.... says revieve, and the number along with a million other wallets I think i exported. Been trying to import them back in but the main transaction still isnt showing, and money someone else threw at me has. I guess it's in a different wallet? Importing/exporting these are hell
along with a ton of other wallets i've made... How can i make a keynote file
@_date: 2016-06-08 04:18:21
So a wallet I don't think I have loaded in Multibit has my money. I've made so many wallets I can't track it down to get it back in my receiving addresses....
the address I send it to. The money is still there. If i search my finder for the btc number its under received along with the other thousand wallet files I made. Any idea how I can turn it into a keynote file so I can just upload it?
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:24:16
:'( is the best person on these forums. I would so do anything for this human.
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:33:25

@_date: 2016-06-04 03:05:16

@_date: 2016-06-04 06:47:32

@_date: 2016-06-05 01:46:30

@_date: 2016-06-04 03:07:45
Eh yeah. Lost my job. Someone exit scammed my pitiful 401k. And then this. On top of this my phone ran out of service, and I bought the wrong card, which I cant refund. Fuck June 3rd.

@_date: 2016-06-04 02:04:29
What If i sent it straight to nucleus?
@_date: 2016-06-04 02:20:43
Just looked at old transactions. Saw an address I sent money to before, used it... and nothing is there. 6/6 confirmations and the wallet it went to empty. I'm begging whoever got lucky to give me a little luck.
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:01:24
How do you contact the owner of the address?? Is this a joke?
