so anytime is an excellent buying opportunity.

thanks, I saw the % based fees right afterwards. So it's good for small payments, but for large &gt; $1000 you are much better off with just classic bank transfer with flat $15 fee or so.

it was almost never used as a "currency" in day to day usage, it was used as the value that backs the currency. As such it's still used, just not in a direct mapping anymore for most currencies.

you sound like a support nightmare. Setup calls that you than do not join etc.
@_date: 2014-10-16 17:32:54
how could it have been better?

Charles Schwab is free.

how is this a solution? Everything is about "too the moon". To make it useful the BTC cannot always be on cold storage, needs to be connected to the net.

in addition, who wants to leave his 100k+ wallet exposed on an internet facing client? I suppose you can create multiple wallets and transfer between them.
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:10:22
maybe you shouldn't advertise that you "lose every time". May encourage additional crime.
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:05:55
and when they accept bitcoin the price of bitcoin may go up a little, and you are happy! And then you can sell your bitcoin without making such a huge loss! Everyone wins.
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:23:38
Because it has been a bear market for a while now?
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:23:13
an ETF doesn't mean they will be save. The ETF could be run by the same standards as Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2014-09-20 07:17:42
But you are tied to the country.
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:50:52
Lucky. Maybe they need bubble you join in you wont be that lucky...
@_date: 2014-04-18 05:15:47
why is it cheap? what are you getting for your $500 that makes it cheap?
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:09:57
But you dont. People without reserves shouldnt really speculate. I hope you got 0 debt at least.
@_date: 2014-12-25 20:45:41
it's not a surprise. A lot of people here are down in value per dollar in bitcoins. They have now settled for the "long haul". His comment basically is saying there may not be a long haul, which makes them angry to the bones. 
I wouldn't be surprised if it wont exist anymore either, or it may exists but it no longer used on a larger scale and basically coins would be worthless.
@_date: 2014-04-18 17:23:31
I guess I would like to see some stats from when the price went from ~50 to 500. Did the userbase increase 10 fold? Did the transactions volume increase 10 fold (would require some code to eliminate same owner transaction.) Did the USD lose value? Did the Bitcoin supply shrink? (this should be a no, as Bitcoins are still being mined).
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:03:13
yes, that is the main topic here.
None uses it for anything, just stories of "you *could* used it for x. Everyone just wants to make a buck with the tulips of the 21st century.
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:41:23
yeah because $10 would be the bottom right? Why would you buy more? what do you think they would useful for?
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:45:59
this is a losers perspective and I hate this attitude when a friend or relative has it - because they will refuse any help or reason why said asset will continue to deprecate.
@_date: 2014-04-18 17:52:05
Right, I haven't seen any proof of an increasing userbase and from what I have seen transaction volume has been steady, not increasing.

Can I sign up to Circle and pay my relative in Europe (I am in the US).
i.e can I initiate a payment to a European bank account without huge fees?
(the relatives wont sign up for bitcoins, I just need to be able to give money into their bank account)

you're just getting less goods for it. Unless you think a string of characters on a disk is a "good" too.
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:10:43
so just install VMware on the old server and run it within a guest OS there. Solved!
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:38:19
I can get them right now, and it's 2015.
Edit: Sub $300
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:29:34
I hate this argument so much, and causing my family lots of monetary damages. No, you are losing money RIGHT now. Your net worth goes up and down with the price of bitcoin if you own a lot of them.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:27:40
a bit sick, but the author of that article is a know asshole too. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 01:03:41
when is bitcoin "dead"?
It's a technology, there will always be a little bit of value to a bitcoin, same as the lehman and enron stocks still had some value after they've gone out of business.
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:31:43
That will be the magic moment when the trend reverses!
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:37:23
the bug happend to him but he just did the bug report. Root cause etc. is due to @_date: 2013-03-13 14:21:16
commit with your own damn money, not with others.
If his little plan "failed" everyone else would have had to pay for it with increased interest rates on CC's.
@_date: 2013-03-13 14:20:06
How will you kill yourself? Life insurance only pays for accidents and sickness, not suicide.
Look up that case with someone attaching the handgun to multiple balloons... and his plan didn't work out.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:47:48
I wonder how the IRS is going to handle all these capital gains. 
You DO intend to pay the taxes, right?
