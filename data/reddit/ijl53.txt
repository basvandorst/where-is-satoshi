June 18, 2010: (I planned on creating a free bitcoin generator). When it gets too hard for mortals to generate 50BTC, new users could get some coins to play with right away.

Exactly how I feel! It really is evolving fast it just needs to maintain the strength to rise :)

If you invested into btc hold. If you want to have fun trading in an unfriendly market then put aside additional funds to trade with. But don't touch your original investment .1 btc is not a lot and you will likely get eaten alive by the fees alone.

Did you direct them to any sites or information, or did they already know what bitcoin was?

They shouldn't have gone with white shirts in the midst of all that mud! i couldn't have kept them clean lol!. Great post though!

No your right, it is not so much the difficulty of coding a bot for another exchange but simply following the volume. This is why a lot of traders use BTC-e because there is more volume and volatility than bitstamp so profit gains are significantly more. This is true with gox I could make way more with the same bot on mt gox than I could on BTC-e my bot on BTC-e does better than stamp by about 80%

Hope this isn't what they meant by rebranding lol

Coinbase is the cheapest and fastest way i can buy coins from in the u.s. They make it convenient for me to buy, so i pay the fee. If you live outside the u.s there may be cheaper ways.

You in San Antonio too?
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:01:47
Because bots make money with 0% fees.

Please use coinbase as they allow to buy instantly directly from your bank wich makes using it for currency purposes easier, so by you using coinbase we have the same exchange rate so when bitpay is higher i dont get have to get screwed using btc. Thanks!

An alternative to use is the blockchain app, scan the private keys you know own the address spend as much as you want with the blockchain client creat a new paper wallet send the rest there. (Not the best practice to re-use paper wallets if your concerned about security)

Sorry I didn't include other posts where i talk about other investment qualities. this was me trying to answer him in about how he told me before autozone stock would be a better outcome. Which is why I made such comparisons. Thanks for your help!

Everyone doesn't realize we need the digital apperance because people believe they have to spend the 700-1000 for 1 real coin. To them it looks like that infomercial on gold coins with eagles on them.

Wow and people say it's to volatile,looks like a healthy climb.
