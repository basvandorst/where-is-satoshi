Hi - yes bitstamp seems like a excellent exchange site for europe (this is where i'm based). Not too worried about sending documents in if this helps me use a secure exchange that people trust. I see they moved from slovenia to london recently. Interesting.

Thanks that's a really good list of bitcoin exchanges. I like the way it's clearly indiacted where you can buy with credit card or paypal. That's helpful for beginners in this space.
As feedback I'd say maybe explain more on how the trust rating was generated, as this is very useful (no one wants to loose their coins) but not clear on your site. Perhaps a small written description of each exchange could be nice too.

Gemini seems to be relatively new, and owned by leading bitcoin investors/figureheads. I'll give it a go - thanks. 
As for Poloniex, there seems to be many excellent reviews as an outstanding cryptocurrency exchange. I might check it out as I'm looking to get into margin trading on altcoins. 
Coinbase used to be seen as the best bitcoin exchange for a long time. This seems position seems to have been lost since an apparent auditing issue and the whole ethereum lockdown (if my research is correct ?)

Nice. I'm curious about Uphold. From their site:


Ok so I feel this type of service may not compare to the best bitcoin exchanges out there, as it's more for all commodities right? But how exactly does this work for btc usd for example? I'm assuming you'd have to setup some sort of escrow like on the localbitcoins.com service?
