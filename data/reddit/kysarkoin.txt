There are many notarization tools and methods out there, from Proof of Existence, to Stampery, to Factom, and CoinDaddy. They all offer their own method and receipts for anchoring data into the blockchain in one way or another. 
This is part of the reason we created Chainpoint, we wanted to work on an industry standard for anchoring data to the Bitcoin blockchain and creating interoperable blockchain receipts. There is no standard format for the cryptographic proof, so we teamed up with a group of veterans within the industry to propose a standardized protocol for this process. These people include:
* Jason Bukowski — Co-Founder &amp; Lead Developer, Tierion
* Manu Sporny — Founder and CEO, Digital Bazaar; Creator of JSON-LD
* Christopher Allen — Principal Architect, Blockstream; Co-author of SSL/TLS
* Ryan Shea — Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Blockstack
* Jude Nelson — Engineering Partner, Blockstack
* Paul Sztorc — VP of Economics, Bloq
* Shawn Wilkinson — Founder &amp; CEO, Storj
* Wayne Vaughan — Co-Founder &amp; CEO, Tierion
It's open source, and [Tierion]( is free to use for the end consumer up to 1,000 records per hour. Our goal is to have Chainpoint adopted as a standardized protocol for creating verifiable proofs.

Tierion doesn't put files on the blockchain. It puts the hash of your file/data/document. Tierion has two API's - one where you send the raw data, it's hashed for you and anchored it into the Blockchain, or, alternatively, you can hash the data yourself and just send the series of hashes. 
Tierion takes all the hashes in every 10 minute period, creates a merkle tree, and anchors the root into a Bitcoin transaction. One hash, one transaction, every block no matter the amount of data or individual records. 
Tierion then gives you a Blockchain Receipt for each individual record, which is a verifiable portable proof used to confirm the integrity of your data. As long as the blockchain is alive, you can always verify all the data you've anchored. Blockchain Receipts have no dependency on Tierion being alive or running (just the Bitcoin blockchain).

Totally depends on which language your most comfortable with, both Pycoin and Bitcore are great libraries. If you're going the web app route, Javascript may be easier to implement than Python. 
For microtransactions, I had to jump in and give a vouch for BlockCypher. The have a micropayment API, in which they subsidize the fee cost of TX's. I'm not aware of any other API does this. I'd highly recommend them, it was pretty easy to integrate as well.

GetGems was built on Counterparty, and received $400K venture investment after its crowdsale from a pretty notable firm in Isreal.

@_date: 2014-09-17 21:19:19
Sure thing.
We're very supportive of Lighthouse - its an awesome protocol build by a great team. But, we're doing a something bit different than Lighthouse.
We're a web-platform, that allows decentralized applications to crowd fund on. If you're familiar with the MaidSafe, Etherum, or Storj crowdsale - that's what we're going after. We want to onboard these decentralized projects, and give them a safe, secure, and reliable platform to raise the funds they need.
Lighthouse is a client side P2P program. While our actual platform is as decentralized it can be (for a web application) - we provide a platform that holds the funds in a multi-sig wallet, have secured 3rd party auditing, and provide a beautiful UI that allows you to see where the money raised is being sent. We also foster community engagement &amp; involvement, our platform allows campaign runners to connect and allow their backers to engage and make decisions on the project with their tokens.
We issue tokens off the Counterparty protocol - and help the companies with their development. Most of these developers don't have the time or knowledge to set up a crowd sale - we do it all for you, and help you along the way. Backers get tokens in exchange for their funding, such as Ether, MaidSafeCoin, StorjCoin, etc. We have a passion for decentralization, and want to see these projects succeed. 
Transparency &amp; security is our  priority, we're trying to be the good guys in this crazy world of crypto &amp; crowd funding. 
TLDR: Lighthouse is client side P2P client side crowd funding application, Koinify is a web platform which specializes in accelerating and funding the development of decentralized applications.

Oh, no worries then - miscommunication. I can't put input into other peoples work - but I'll defend our pledge to transparency &amp; security all day. 
Agreed, many great things being worked on in 2.0. Many that could fall under that 'scam' category....many that are also just as legitimate as us. 
Some started advertising as 'crypto equity' then changed their models after ICO'ing. Some issued their own coins. Some ran away with the money. We're trying to avoid all that - and do crypto crowd funding the correct way, fully compliant &amp; secure. Backing a project through Koinify gets you tokens, but in no way do they represent stake or equity % in the company.

I'm not sure how we could be considered a 'scam'. We are a platform - we do not issue tokens for ourselves. We're VC backed. We don't need to make "KoinifyKoin" to support development.
As for a crowd funding platform that specializes in DAC's and DApp's, we are taking an approach to fix everything that has been broken by previous companies and projects.
All funds are secured in multi-signature wallet. We do a more extensive due diligence report on all projects than any Proof Of Developer service out there. All funds are audited and transparent. All funds are laid out how they will be spent, where they will go, what the team uses them for, etc. 
By the way - we're also the first to issue our own wallet, to avoid the need for Counterwallet.
So, I'm not sure what you're referencing - but we are the farthest thing from a scam. There is nothing for us to scam. Our entire model is built around transparency, security, and safety of our members funds &amp; projects.

I encourage you to read Gem's white paper.

For any readers: you can check my post history as well, neuroMode made a very detailed complaint in his subreddit where I addressed all of his points. There is still inaccurate information presented by neuroMode here, thought this would be better than a blatant smear attempt. You can read the posts below to see that I was able to address every single one of neuroMode's concerns; and he wrote this afterwords with almost no indentation of using the correct &amp; valid information. 
(I was chatting with him here; by him posting this to then asking his sub for 'upvotes to get me to front page' -- shows this was done for attention. Any points could have been addressed in previous thread, PM with me, or any of our emails I offered many, many times.)
You haven't been involved in token sales before, have you? Until this, 100% of the money went to the developer from day 1. You do a crowd sale to fund the development. Why would we have a sale if they project is developed? That's what the money goes towards. You seem to be missing why there is a crowdsale, and you seem very intitled to "seeing the open source algorithms" -- they'll be open sourced when they're developed, like I said multiple times. 
Sounds a lot like the token sale isn't for you. We're not putting a gun to your head forcing you to purchase, **its a choice** after you are informed about the sale. You seem to be forgetting this. 
Show me a sale that **didn't get 100% of the money from the start**. There isn't one. Where we're your posts during Ethereum, Storj, MaidSafe, BitBay, RibbitRewards, etc?
None of the information I corrected neuroMode on was ported here as well; deliberately posting misleading information. I encourage all users to make decisions for themselves. At first, you seemed like a legitimate community member with questions. Now, with your language and tone, its looks clear that you're trying to smear us because you didn't like my reply (which, countered every single one of your points -- and then you edit your posts afterwards), or or whatever else reason.
We are doing everything to be secure and transparent, and your saying the model we're doing is "unsafe". They get 50% upon start (750 BTC) -- they've been working on this since March, a 4 man team. If you do the math, this is actual a *very underpaid development team* if you compare to salaries out here for the same development full-time positions. 
Regardless, this is a very again poorly informed post, like his previous one. Anyone can shoot us an email if you have a Q about we operate @ hello -- but many of neuroMode's claims are false here. Please, I encourage all to **make a decision for yourself, don't listen to the good, the bad, the whoever**. Theres people on both side of the coin, this was clearly written to deliberately try to hurt someone else's reputation.
Btw, this is the wrong subreddit for this. This is my last comment on this subject; feel free to contact us directly with any other questions or concerns, but I think the downvotes of your comments speak for the validity / truth behind them. It should also be noted our CEO, Tom Ding, was just given one of the two Industry Board Director seats for the Counterparty Foundation.

If you post anything on that forum that isn't positive, you are shadow banned on the spot. The "ceo" has acknowledged there's a "bug" in the software that is causing this, though I can't find anything on the nodebb (the software they use) issue tracker supporting this. In fact there's no bugs ever opened on their github that involve people getting banned erroneously, open or not.
The end result is this surreal dreamland where everything is gold and the fruit flows from the trees like rain. People "mining" with imaginary miners, all getting excited for an illegal unregistered security launching, from a "white paper" that's 100% bullshit and contains no technical detail whatsoever.

What differentiates you liking OpenBazzar, from Ethereum, Storj, Maidsafe, etc?
I'm genuinely curious. Is it because they didn't so a crowd sale? Im a big supporter of the 2.0 space (and everyone is entitled to their opinions), but I'm really curious as to your thought on this. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:37:00
No problem.
Almost there, you pretty much got it. If you are the creator of a decentralized application, you could come to Koinify - and we can onboard your project onto our platform. We'd then help you with moving your project forward (business, development, funding, etc), and transparenty and securley manage all the funding of your project. 
We also do our due-dillagence and make sure projects we onboard have the potential, to prevent developers from receiving funding for a project they're in over their heads. We also do the multi-sig to ensure the campaign runner doesn't run away with funds, nor us.
If we *have* to be compared, we'd like to say we're more of an AngelList for funding rather than Kickstarter ;)

If you came with a serious AMA, we can propose civil and critical questions. Having a gang-bang AMA will only result in it being revoked, as well.
I must say though, surprised your responding. People are looking for answers. Its no doubt you'll get some "raw" questions; but we could honestly make it clear that because of the circumstances, it needs to be a civil discussion. You have to also understand *why* there is some hostility with some members and GAW (regardless if you agree or not), and an AMA would be useless if you just try to disbunk everything by simply saying we don't know what we're talking about. There needs to be clear and direct questions and answers from all parties to be successful. 
The main difference here is that the community collectively down-votes posts; some are clear shill accounts (regardless of if its you or community members; they're low activity accounts that *only* post positive comments and defend GAW); rather than the CEO censoring the forum. Downvoted posts still show up, and their account isn't banned either. I believe the community collectively doing somthing is a much better scenario than a leader dictating/controlling what is posted. If your post gets downvoted into oblivion here, theres probally a reason why. 
Looking forward to hearing progression upon it. Thanks for the reply.

This seems to be the best case scenario for the current state of affairs. I think a lot of people have an issue with "grilling him 1:1" in a bitcoin conference, because by asking these hard questions we know he doesn't have a justified answer too can look bad for us all.

They're using BitGo, they pride themselves in being the strongest security solution, and Bitstamp literarily implemented it with one line of code. They're entire team worked around the clock for almost 96 hours and got back online with help from Pantera. 
Just because it was fast, dosen't mean theres some underlying secrets. It could very well mean they found a solid solution, and work fast. Multi-Sig wallets, no other exchange does that. How is this a bad thing, at all?
If you don't like them, don't use them. Until any other exchange adopts multi-signature wallet solution, they really have a leading edge now. I dont think its scary at all, I think its fucking awesome the way they handled such a shitty situation.

Biased considering I work for them, but [Tierion]( lets you anchor any data directly into the Bitcoin blockchain with a standardized REST API. We create a merkle root of all the records received in every 10 minute window, and anchor the root into a Bitcoin transaction every block. Tierion can anchor millions of records into a single Bitcoin transaction. 
You're given a blockchain receipt, which is a digital proof anybody can use to independently verify the data against the Bitcoin blockchain. Our [service is free]( up to 1,000 records per hour, or 3 records per second.

It's how Circle decides to set their exchange rate, every website is different. 
*Fee* : **Definiton**
*A payment made to a professional person or to a professional or public body in exchange for advice or services.*
I don't see how an exchange rate falls under that category. They state they do not charge fees on the services they offer, which currently, is bitcoin at the price of @ $236.21. Just because they do not match other exchanges does not mean it's a "fee". Think of it how you like, but that statement is incorrect. They can price their bitcoins however they want. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:42:46
Yup, and just to be clear, the USD is being held in the same manner BTC would be. There still needs to be 2 of the 3 signers to request a withdraw with verified identities, just as multi-sig BTC would work. 
itBit will refuse any withdraw that does not have two verified requests. Vlad will not give an approval until he audits and evaluates their code, and BitGo is assigned to listen to Vlad's evaluation.

Hey, Koinify here.
Not sure if you're referring to us as the 'scam site'. We're a platform for crowd funding decentralized applications and projects, a legitimate company with full time employees and VC backing. We purposely are exclusive and only do one sale at a time, so yes, we are only currently selling Factoids. We have Augur's sale upcoming in the next month as well. 
When you purchase Factoids, you are not donating. You are making a purchase of the Factoid tokens. Not sure where you're thinking you get "nothing". The Factoids will be used to be converted into entry credits that must be used to hash documents on the Factom network. 
It is a software sale, we are selling Factoids which are in essence a one time license to use the protocol. We have also implemented many accountability features, such as vested milestones. This means that there are three detailed milestones laid out, and Factom will not receive any portion of the money until the milestone is hit. The BTC is stored in a multi-sig account until then. Factom is not just being handed all of this money, and if they don't deliver the detailed milestones or our technical evaluator dose not believe it's up to par, the money will not be released / will be given back to the participants.
The multi-signature account needs the technical evaluator (Vlad Zamfir, a well known and respected bitcoin security researcher / developer). Before we did the Gems (Which recieved a $400K seed investment post-sale from a very notable VC firm) and the Factom sale, 100% of the money raised in sales we're immediately given in full to the project/team. We facilitate actual accountability when it comes to releasing of funds now. 
We have met Factom many times, our team has flown to Austin 3 times just this month to meet with them (on top of the many times in the past ~4 months as well). We vet our projects for a LONG time and make sure they meet many qualifications before taking them on for a sale. Factom has been in development for a very long time, they have working code written, and a live alpha API that you can use today. We stay in very close contact with the community, and listen to their responses. 
If you have any legitimate questions regarding the sale or structure of how Koinify operates, I would be happy to answer or help out. Everything is clearly laid out on the project page, as well as in the purchasers agreement, nobody is forcing you to participate. The ones who believe in the protocol and want to use/support Factom will. These aren't 2014 bitcointalk.org sales anymore -- we have **real projects**, **real code**, **real teams**, and most importantly, **real accountability**.

Please point out my two lies, I fully understand what I said.

How do you get investors for a decentralized, open source protocol? Theres no layer for profit, revenue, or anything. Where would the VC make their money back?
Software token sales fit very well for a decentralized protocol. People are pre-purchasing access to the software. The protocol requires Factoids to use. If you want to use it, great. If not, nobody is shaking you down for your lunch bits by force.

Tierion scales to millions upon millions of records - we benchmark frequently with these numbers. Last weeks Distributed Health Hackathon had 13 of 18 teams build their project with Tierion, including all five winners. Tierion is in live production mode today, with a robust API that any software developer can use.

I use Gyft daily, and buy GC's with BTC. 
I'd imagine anybody wanting to buy GC's does the same, rather buy from a known company than a dude on a forum.

Known scam: People will go into the stores and scratch the PIN code / card number and take a picture of it, and put it back on the rack. Then they keep checking the card until someone else loads it.
Was there a secret PIN or anything on it? Any chance this could be the case? I've heard of people doing it with gift cards.

Whats the story with Jua?
@_date: 2015-02-09 04:24:31
He makes $1.00 for everybody who signs up. That's why unfortunately. I agree, they're KYC is a little intense (SSN &amp; all) to withdrawal.

Curious if they purposely write so poorly hoping that the only people who fall for it probably won't have 2FA enabled for their account.

They 100% have a retaining value - the value is how much you're willing to pay to access the protocol. Is Factoids sell for $0.02 (example, complete random number) and somebody buys it, they are agreeing that hashing a document into the blockchain with Factom is worth $0.02.
Factoids are not designed to make money or retain value. They're designed to operate the protocol. It's like purchasing pre-access to the software. You don't seem to get it.

True. I have heard first hand from somebody who looses a lot of things, "I trust Coinbases vault more than myself."
