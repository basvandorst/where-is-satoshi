Nope, [they're also gutless](

There caving into threats by the feds that have no basis in actual law.
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:41:24
Did you read the article? They tried to work it out the right way.
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:58:11
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2015-06-20 11:17:57
It's a bullshit line
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:59:27
The threat is that they'll be audited more and the feds would pay closer attention generally.
@_date: 2015-06-20 00:09:26
I can't find a ToS on their site, do you have access to it? I've emailed them as well.
@_date: 2015-06-19 22:33:12
Does anyone have any recommendations on where this vendor can turn to? 
@_date: 2015-06-19 22:55:01


Nope, they also ban such legal sales.
@_date: 2015-11-15 05:07:19
I was affected. Sold high. Bought at the subsequent drop. Got a negative account balance from Gemini. That being said I don't have the time or money to deal with the legal system in NY.
@_date: 2015-03-01 17:34:08
Haha sorry I waited till the offer expired to post out of respect for the company. 
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:43:29
How 'limited' is the time of no transaction fee?
@_date: 2015-03-01 17:31:19
Oh that's good to know. Much appreciated!
@_date: 2015-11-14 16:47:32
Gemini should have eaten the cost. Call it a learning experience. 
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:38:10
Made all my balance zero and took everything out
@_date: 2015-03-01 19:27:38
You're absolutely right which is why some, especially on the libertarian side,  'get it'.
@_date: 2015-11-14 16:58:15
I've taken everything out of my account. I know it's not a ton (~17 btc and my cash) but if others join in they'll really feel what having a thin book feels like. They've betrayed my trust and at this point they need us way more than we need them. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 16:49:31
They gave me a negative account balance.
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:29:13


How limited? They clearly plan on charging a 'convenience fee' or something in the relatively near future. I'd rather know what I'm getting into instead of having an unknown fee hanging over my head.
@_date: 2015-11-16 21:57:53
Would it also be a mistake to buy at $500 only to have the price drop to $300 moments later? If you send BTC to an address you transposed incorrectly do you think you will get your funds returned to you for a do over? That's not how it works. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 16:34:54
Yes, total bullshit.
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:43:46
Got it. Is there a way to disable that feature or is that something I would have to do with a wallet? I was thinking if you have a 2D barcode printed on a poster to allow for donations to a cause or something.
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:40:28
Do what you want with your property, I'll do what I want with mine. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 21:58:58
[My ELI5 about the original situation](
What they actually did wrong which led to this action is reverse legitimate transactions without the consent of both parties because the buyer complained. It was essentially a chargeback, something that's supposed to be solved by using bitcoin. What if a buy BTC from someone at $300 and it jumps to $400 right after? With this precedent the seller could undo the transaction. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 21:25:27
Uh, no this should be a one time thing. They should introduce a safeguard against such a thing warning of market changing transactions.
@_date: 2015-03-01 23:02:25
Ratings are ratings regardless of how you feel about the content.
@_date: 2015-03-01 17:38:10
I don't see why they would limit themselves but I also think the right is generally more afraid of change so targeting them is a bigger priority.
@_date: 2015-10-07 05:54:46
So then what? Is the experiment a failure?
@_date: 2015-10-07 03:35:13
Or being given them.
@_date: 2015-11-14 02:39:45
At least some are real trades because one of my very high limit sells was fulfilled.
@_date: 2015-11-15 08:28:54
I zeroed out my account completely
@_date: 2015-10-27 15:27:32
I was going to say, that sort of dress might get you shot around here. But then I realized you were making a missionary joke.
@_date: 2015-10-11 00:43:59
As someone who's using Gemini my guess is that, like me, many potential buyers are waiting for their ACH funds to clear.
@_date: 2015-03-01 21:54:42
Perhaps a couple will but those who do were likely never going to be supportive. The key to removing the genuine fear associated with something new line Bitcoin is to making it well understood. 
@_date: 2015-10-07 03:36:05
I'm confused. Do you want bitcoin adoption?
@_date: 2015-10-07 19:08:50
Sure but you could work for euros. No reason you can't be paid in btc
@_date: 2015-03-01 17:06:50
I think I and others understand the difference. 
@_date: 2015-10-10 04:05:32
I tried two tests. First I made a purchase with both my Starbucks account and Fold by having insufficient funds to cover the full amount on the Starbucks account. Then I tried another transaction where I scanned the Starbucks account without any funds and then used Fold to pay. Both transactions gave me stars.
@_date: 2015-10-07 03:49:57
The FAQ sounds complicated for sellers, especially those unfamiliar with the intricacies of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:50:03
How was consent not given for the original transaction? 
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:52:02
Thanks! That bot is really cool. 
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:39:34
That would be even worse... All action after the event wasn't necessarily influenced by it. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 17:41:43
Why do I care if you know what I own? I also own multiple Jeeps, should I have not divulged that either? Thing is, just because I own them doesn't mean that they are in the same place (neither the Jeeps or the Bitcoin are) nor does it mean that I am concerned about their security (I am not).
I also didn't tell anyone how much I have, just the minimum that I have.
@_date: 2015-10-31 04:13:31
Why not use Circle which has no fees?
@_date: 2015-11-16 22:55:16
Hah! Good luck with that. What happened here was someone not knowing enough about the market playing where he had no business playing. Not exactly a mistake, more like poor judgement. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 20:18:09
It must be different now because we had no issues
@_date: 2015-10-07 03:38:29
@_date: 2015-10-31 16:05:44
True but only a fool wouldn't. It's too expensive.

I wonder if the gun proposals by Obama have anything to do with it.
@_date: 2013-01-22 04:24:24
If nobody else is going to try I will! Please speak now if you are though so I don't waste my time.
Edit 2: I went ahead and emailed Mega to see about Bitcoin acceptance with several options on how to process the payments. 
@_date: 2013-01-17 04:33:15
How will you lock the box if the key is inside? /s
@_date: 2013-01-10 02:32:26
Perfect! Thank you.
@_date: 2013-01-22 05:51:59
Really depends on what you have to offer but I am very open to a wide range of proposals. I am not doing this to be a big money maker for me, although that'd be nice, I just want to see Bitcoin grow and see this as a great way to make that happen. As I mentioned in the other Mega post, I wasn't going to step up until I heard that nobody else had gotten the green light yet. 
Edit: Spelling
@_date: 2013-01-14 03:07:35
I did because I value Reddit, ads annoy me, and I like the little extra features it offers.
@_date: 2013-01-18 12:36:39
The gun talk scares people. It gets them thinking about a government that is increasing in size and will to invade your life. That is what drives things like gold up so why not Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-08-04 20:16:47
The exact same thing is already fully funded on [Kickstarter](  Double dipping?
@_date: 2013-01-11 04:35:50
Mods are touchy over there
@_date: 2013-01-17 04:31:47
What if you got one of those do it yourself coins that say 5BTC but really load it with more, a lot more? Or, even better, can you load more that the stated amount onto a regular coin since you can read the public key on the outside?
@_date: 2013-01-16 12:58:33
Thanks. Maybe I will relist if/when I hear back. 
@_date: 2013-01-17 13:14:11
It is 3 million now if I am not mistaken. 
@_date: 2013-08-04 21:13:44
Then why have a 30 btc threshold?
@_date: 2013-01-22 05:15:08
[That was fast](
@_date: 2013-01-22 13:16:05
A reseller sells upgrades to Mega's premium services.
@_date: 2013-01-16 04:38:01
Sounds like something for the police to handle not Reddit.
@_date: 2013-01-22 06:58:43
Email sent :)
@_date: 2013-01-17 22:06:31
Why apologize? If the list is inaccurate, it is inaccurate.  Surely as someone who is a stickler for the constitution he would want to follow the rules to the letter!
@_date: 2013-01-16 05:36:12
Guy deals with shady people, one of which is holding his dog ransom, and he wants the Reddit community to bail him out. He is in a rough situation but it is, or at least should be, a police matter.  He also opened the Reddit account today and has no credibility.
@_date: 2013-01-21 16:22:41
Considering the fact that Mega allows third parties to sell their premium services it shouldn't be too hard to set up a bitcoin payment service right now.  In fact Mega claims they will link to all of their resellers on the website.
@_date: 2013-08-04 22:05:04
Right, but if people actually want it they should fund it on Kickstarter because it is unlikely that the bitcoin one will be successful.
