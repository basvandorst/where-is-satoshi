This is interesting. What benefits does it have over using the exchanges themselves?

Thanks for proving my point. Crypto is roughly 9 years old, up against the entire history of fiat and it's revolutionizing the world. 
What do you think will happen when paypal accepts bitcoin?   
What about credit cards implementing crypto?  
You know you can pay mortgages and bills with bitcoin in some places right?  
Developing countries are thriving off crypto over fiat because their countries currencies are worthless.  
Did you know you can buy real estate using bitcoin?  
Did you know you can buy cars with bitcoin?  
Your head is so thick that you're proving me right and can't see through your skull man.

Yea I looked at your post history, same story everywhere, 4 day old account. I guess by whatever your definition is, I'm a zealot. I just think bitcoin and crypto-currencies in general are a pretty big deal.

My god man you're making your own point here I don't know how you can't see it. You can already purchases a lot of legitimate things through crypto and one day soon you'll be able to purchase all the things you've mentioned with it (in some places you already can).
