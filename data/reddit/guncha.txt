You'd be correct if he held through all the upswings and downswings, but unfortunately the typical scenario goes more like this:
1) hold a bunch of coins
2) their value 2x or 5x
3) a lot of people say that the price is too high and that it's going to crash
4) price slips a little, everybody freaks out and sells including the OP, and we have another crash
5) rinse and repeat
I honestly believe Bitcoin adoption would be much further if the price had stayed at a solid $10 for the last two years. So no, these "investors" do not help shit.

Hey, well that was quick ;) It's ticking in my browser as I type this. Thanks!

I'm sure they are happy how their evil plan worked and they arranged things to extract those 90 cents of commission from you, muahahah!
No, but seriously though, it sucks that this is not a well known fact that they could do such a thing and I guess if your anonymity is so important, you wouldn't do business with them. Then again, I have no ideas of anonymity when dealing with Mt. Gox..

I would totally use this if it wasn't for the "This extension can access all your data at mtgox.com" warning.

Bitcoin will probably appreciate, especially with the upcoming halving of supply, but I don't think it will ever approach the value of BTC during the bubble. Early miners would have done very, very good to sell at $25. I'm sure a lot of them did.

What do you store the orders and transactions in?
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:51:58
Try double spending it (to a new address) and this time attach a fee. Blockchain.info interface might not allow you to do this and some nodes in the network might reject it if they saw the previous transaction, but you can always export the private key and use a different client.

What happened?
@_date: 2013-03-09 01:06:49
But the volume has been steadily increasing, so you'd expect the price to not correlate with volume in dollars.

I see. Makes sense, but why not use something like Redis for the memory store since they have replication and persistence figured out? It would be slower, given, compared to a custom solution, but it could still easily do 20k transactions / s (I'm guessing), which would be completely satisfactory for even a huge exchange like MtGox.

You're assuming that there is going to be one point at which all the hoarders will realize that this is the top and flood the market driving the price to the floor. Fortunately, people disagree. Some people think that the price is already out of whack and will crash soon. The early speculators might exit at a rate that's offset by new interest in bitcoin as a currency or an investment, avoiding crazy volatility.
