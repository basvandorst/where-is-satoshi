Curse word to some, but have to looked into litecoin, billed as silver to bitcoins gold, and with the lightening network working successfully on testnet and its recent traction it could be a nice middle ground for you?

Gamble of the day... Futures expire tomorrow, how many people are going to cash out hoping to catch the dip, and how many are going to close their eyes not look at the charts for 24 hours? 
Im a fan of day trading, but with the speed LN is growing it feels like a risky move and could be out of pocket

Discussion point: Wallstreet Bonuses are getting announced next week, with payments following there after. How much of this money you expect to flow into crypto and BTC and where do you think that will tke the prices? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:30:43
did this last night, made 10% more BTC for the past few days, having back in BTC for when the ETH run corrects and stays down 
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:04:51
but people wont get it... people in crypto will get it, it will just confuse joe public because its rubbing in their faces 2 coins with almost identical names, with a rocky past, and a cat fighting future.
also, begging for tips, in 3 different coins, for a super simple idea... simmer down buddy

Happy Birthday to what i now consider my future. And thanks to everyone who has been there since block 0 and beyond, you guys are the MVP's in all this

In addition to this, given coinbases shady past with BCH, insider trading, Lack of Segwit and spamming of the memepool and it being an easy on ramp for money. Who else has suspicions things like Segwit are being held off until wallstreet money can enter at a lower price bracket and reward with some form of payoff? Because im sure that IF segwit was already implemented the price would sky rocket as soon as its confirmed/in-place 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:13:44
didnt say market, I said bull run. I appreciate the market is still stron
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:57:25
ETH isn't a currency, comparing it to BTC is impossible. Lightning network and SegWit across the board is the spark BTC needs to engage boosters again.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:08:02
a lot of FUD about it bursting and any time the price moves. Prime example if you look at the past month or 2, we broke $10k then got to $19k insane right? that $10k in less than a week.
 Then news out of context screams about BTC going down to $14,500 in a week loosing $5k, and claiming the bubble has burst. It hasnt its a pretty normal crypto correction a huge growth.
ultimately im saying look at anything you see or hear in context to the market as a whole.
I personally don't think BTC will burst. We will grow, then have healthy corrections but to burst down to 0 i would be very surprised

"3) Somebody/Group who is already much more wealthy than 1Million BTC"
I take issue with this one. No one, no matter how wealthy would ever consider $14 Billion not enough to warrant worrying about. Anyone of great wealth especially those in the financial and business sector know every cent counts, let alone billions
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:47:51
Whats everyones thoughts and opinions on when the next bull run will come? 
Anyone else making form easy coin form the ETH pump?
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:23:00
Year it stops the need for fire. Before anything, get used to dealing in Euros, GDAX won't accept a transfer in GBP. As for holding it on an exchange, I assume it's as safe as holding anything on an exchange, the issue with Keep coins in is you don't have the keys, and if you don't have the keys you technically don't have the coins, so Keeping euros there to buy a dip seems fine 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:02:03
What a lovely idea of a community lottery, subscribed and entered to see how all this plays out! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:57:57
I love it, only in crypto can we be down 24% BTC-EUR and still be up hugely compared to last month. 25% would normally cripple something but over here in crypto land its just a christmas sale and wouldn't surprise me if we broke 20k by years end again when family start getting together and dinner table discussions happen 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:38:08
its a real shame OP, im sorry. I know its easy to say as someone not related but I would think of your brothers legacy as contributing to the success and growth of BTC. 
If he did have anyhwere near 15,000 coins, him selling using them when he did was a contributing factor in Bitcoins growth. So next time you see an ATH hit, try not to think it would of made your brother down, but be proud that he contributed to that, he help make succeed that tech he believed so strongly in 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:07:50
Glad you're sorted make sure you active you're revolut euro account before trying to transfer money to GDAX, and like I said before, only transfer euros 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:17:15
its crazy isn't it? Im sat here reading your comment thinking but 9000 would take us to a healthy correction, only to open up gdax and realise just how much we have gone up since last weeks 10k excitement. $17,250 I started buying crypto in may, at around $2,000 the increasing adoption of this is so amazingly exciting 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:29:39
Best donation would be to buy my mother In Law a house so come next year she wont be homeless, or worse, living in my spare room...
But in all seriousness, a charity that gos to helping vulnerable and older people find hosing and accommodation would be nice.
Another idea, buying up green belt land to make into public space. Its a huge problem in the UK that gorgeous chunks of nature are getting built on while derelict industrial units remain standing, it breaks my heart every time I see it. and so many people &amp; animals would benefit for preserving natural areas 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:50:24
I honestly wouldnt of called that a dip. It was a healthy correction for a few days of huge growth and too many weak hands dipping in and getting scared 
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:24:27
I couldn't get past the screenshot at the top... investment value of $3000 and $3,000 in rows 1 and 2... its the same number and if thats the intro to the whole article I cant but any faith in the info or the maths 
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:37:07
Well I was going to the gun shop today, and the profit that was paying for that has gone, so all I can do is look at endangered animals
@_date: 2018-05-14 12:25:26
in hindsight, it kind of makes it look like im a really shitty cybercrimes detective  
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:31:09
Well im my context, I ment it had gone down rather than up... But I also went down almost the same as it needed to go up to get to 12k
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:22:58

So bitcoiners, how did the weekend treat you all? hands up who was able to use BTC in their day to day activities this weekend?
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:38:26
I'm sorry but any service that doesn't list BTC right off the bat is bogus as fuck. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:51:05
I never thought id see a cooked but also raw as fuck pizza. today i was proved wrong 
@_date: 2018-05-09 08:02:13
Im off to the gun shop this weekend, so if all you bull whales would make some moves in the next few days, that would be swell. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:11:01
Im really confused why your photo of a phone has a mac window corner in it... also, how old is your wallet? you probably also have Shitcoin Bcash to dump and get more BTC 
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:30:22
I assume buying the ownership of the infrastructure etc. no matter how decentralised it is, someone, somewhere started it, created the interface and the structure behind it. They have the access and passwords and coding to that system. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:21:08
you know, up until this point, I never really thought about balloons having qualified pilots. Silly I know but I just sort of assumed it was a pice or piss 
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:11:49
I just woke from a dream that BTC had passed $12,000. In my sleepy headed excitement I checked my phone and literally the opposite has happened 
@_date: 2017-02-22 13:06:32
Thats really helpful! thanks! 
@_date: 2017-02-22 11:07:41
the £10 was a hypothetical small amount of spending money, I didnt feel the need to give exact figures of what I wanted to hold as spending and what I want to hold in cold storage. Apparently I did, So my apologies for that confusion.
And although I am read as much as I can find, I was sure a human interaction and explanation might of been a helpful resource too, personal experiences and advice is always nice to balance out against pages of articles.  
@_date: 2017-02-22 10:20:35
Thanks, I was just reading that, but am still struggling to find things on there about Paper wallets. I have no interest at the moment to shop with BTC beyond maybe holding around£10 in a virtual wallet (mostly because I don't fully understand how shopping with it works yet) Which out of the wallets show in the guide and also paper wallet generators would you save are the most new user friendly? 
@_date: 2017-02-22 10:37:38
Thanks :) I just liked the idea off the Paper wallets being totally off line and secure from (at least digital) attack. Would you ever recommend using a mobile app wallet? given my phone is protected with fingerprint and password?  
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:45:10
I honestly cant tell if this is a troll article or not.. Buy low, sell high, buy again... and the prospect of trading on coinbase gives me cold sweats. surly it should be directing to Gdax if it had any form of credibility 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:43:56
SO January then? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:09:36
Get a Revolut account. its a cross currency prepay account (can now actually get your wage payed into it and pay bills from it etc) but it means you can deal with euro/gbp at the current exchange rate without fees or paying a premium, it also means SEPA to GDAX is free and really simple to set up. my money going to GDAX takes about a day and bringing money from GDAX back to Revolut is within the 2 days stated. its an absolute blessing and makes life so simple 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:32:48
I see it as something to look forward to each day, around 3:30pm UK time, a huge dip happens, and then over the course of the evening/night it climbs back up to a new ATH 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:31:03
Same, just on a recovery from a BTC euro dip €8282 and its logged me out with error messages when i try to get back in, all I can do it watch the graph climb. Luckily It happened when I was in BTC on Euro or id be less than impressed! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:13:08
Honestly, I was in ETH for the tech, i moved back to BTC because I want to move house in a few years and BTC has more potential to minimise the additional mortgage costs
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:15:09
Im back in now 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:12:03
Same. A lot of new money moved in with all the hype about $10k but its just been an overwhelming surge on their system I would assume. They will sort it out. They always do 
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:31:31
At the moment no, you cant receive or send to external wallets, only internal. I don't know if this is set to change any time soon, but for the everyday joe, who isn't into crypto for the decentralisation, and the everyday user who wants the coin at hand to use everyday I dont think this will be a huge problem.
*let it be noted, im not making comment or say im either for or against the transferability of this, simply highlighting it as an extremely popular and user friendly method of "purchasing" *

Okay, who left the gate to the bull pen open again?

who the hell day trades on coinbase and pays fee's? GDAX my man, its coinbases exchange but limit orders don't occur fees

It sounds really interesting given Africa is showing such a promise adopting it! 
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:14:04
im no financial guru, but I would say your best "fail safe" is to set a sell order at either your buy price, or maybe $200 (or what ever your willing to loose) less, to allow for a dip in price before a rise, that way, even if the worst happens, you wouldn't of lost that much. 
you could also then periodically, every month or 2, reassess where you set your sell order to capitalise on the gains you will make, while still retaining a definite cash out amount. 
If you then back up these sell orders with buy orders for an amount you feel comfortable re investing back in at to capitalise on your losses.
Im sure their are exchanges out there that will allow you to automate all of this to an extent, but if you're just starting out, like many others coinbase might be your go too, in which case, you can set up price alerts in the app that notify you when your parameters are met, thus allowing you to manually buy and sell as you see fit.
