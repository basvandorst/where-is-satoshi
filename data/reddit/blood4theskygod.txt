Is there a guide on how to accept Lightning payments on Woocommerce shop? (Yes, I know there are risks.)
@_date: 2018-05-02 01:16:54
It does use bch address.

They can not.

I chose the 1 million number arbitrarly, the point is when t --&gt; infinity, the role of luck/variance nears zero (but it's never exactly zero, as mathematicians like to point out).

Incorrect. His course is getting updated every month with top notch instructors and I'm saying this as someone deeply disappointment with the side he chose on the great scaling debate.

I'm a professional poker player, as it is my main income; as it has been for the last 4-5 years. Of course we both have no way of proving what we say about ourself, but that is not the point.
The point is that luck has no deciding factor in no way shape or form in poker **in the long term**. The only deciding factor is if your edge against your opponents is greater than the house edge against you, aka rake. Variance can be a bitch in the short term, insane swings, specially in PLO, are completely standard. However, the bigger picture doesn't change, once you have something like a million hands, it's almost impossible to have a large difference between your winnings and your ev. 
The fact that you don't seem to understand this, coupled with the fact that you were playing in the boom years as you yourself admitted, probably means that you never got interested in the theoretical and mathematical aspects of poker. Which means you should not be making judgements about poker.

I'm willing to bet that you have never ever been a professional poker player. To say that luck is the deciding factor in poker is not to undestand what variance is and what long term is. Poker has 0 (zero) luck in the long term as the variance in the short term cancels itself out and you get insanely close to your EV.

I have a hard time understanding this? Just because we can choose not to play, it becomes a skill game?!?
BJ is a luck based game but it differs from others that it has a memory, i.e. past actions/cards influence the new actions/cards, which means a person with a perfect card counting skills can actually beat the game. The variance would be very huge though, as the edge gained from card counting is miniscule. 


This is true and what I've been saying all along. You might play against a complete donk and he can take all your money in a night. That doesn't mean you made the wrong choices, or your strategy was -EV. It just means that luck/variance is huge in poker, but plays no role in the long term.

What source? Both of your statements are wrong. Blocksize is needed to be about 600mb to sustain peak time visa level transactions all the time. This is without considering what Graphene can do (it might actually reduce this to 10%)
Not only that, LN whitepaper does not call for a gigabyte block, let alone a 100gb block. Here, skip to the 10. Conclusion part: 
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:02:58
Dude those small blockers rejected a measly 2mb increase, you know that right? You must also realize that pro blocksize increase camp of the community is gone? How do you envision getting any sort of consensus now that those people are gone? "Let's wait for lightning" is the new scaling method now, you should get used to it.

Litecoin is kind of like Bitcoin Beta/Testnet but it's better than Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:33:53


What the hell are you talking about? Go to the Conclusion part in the very pdf file you linked:
If all transactions using Bitcoin were conducted inside a network of
micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels
per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require
133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per


Perhaps you were not thinking at all. Blocks size per day?!? Just admit that you are speaking on things you have no idea about.
How much storage it takes is irrelevant, when you can just prune the thing, **as explained in the fucking white paper itself**. 
This is slowly starting to become a discussion about bigger blocks, and I definitely do not wanna have that discussion. Your initial statements are both wrong, I wanted to demonstrate that, that's all.

I think there's a big difference between what's the current state of the network on paper, and in reality. Sure, everyone can fork the code but in reality, there's no decentralization in the implementation. The guys holding the github keys are going to be the ones to decide. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:24:48
There is no point to discuss since we're only speculating on future decisions by the Core devs. But I do hope you're right and the blocksize would be increased in the future, coupled with LN being a success. I don't really have a dog in this fight, I hold no BTC or BCH or any other bitcoin fork. I just don't think there's any realistic chance of a blocksize increase.

I have a bridge to sell you if you believe that.

You exaggerated 1gb to 100gb and you call it exaggerating a bit? LN whitepaper calls for 130 something **mb** blocks.

One must be insane to accept 0-conf BTC.

This doesnt make any sense.
