Really? Typosquatting is so old the US made a law in 1999 against it. Nothing is evolving...

Really. Where did I hear that before. Washington Post, two years ago, 'bout [Bitcoin isn’t the future of money — it’s either a Ponzi scheme or a pyramid scheme](


You will say, the Post is wrong: it's neither a Ponzi nor is it a pyramid scheme. I agree. We finally understand better, here's an excellent, recent article about [
The Problem with Calling Bitcoin a “Ponzi Scheme”](

Now you:




How many years or decades do need to pass before you admit there's nothing


You meant gambling, aren't you. There's not a trace of investing in these things. No, they are not a pyramid neither a Ponzi, they are a new sort of scam: a [Nakamoto scheme](

1. At the time, it was quite the deal. Hindsight is one thing but at that moment? Nah.
2. Do not be so sure the time will not come again when 10000 BTC won't buy you even a slice of pizza.

The sure way is to melt the hard drive using a bit of thermite (you can purchase it legally online, 4lbs for 20 bucks). I *guarantee* noone will ever recover anything from the results: if someone attempts, their biggest problem won't be finding where the sectors were in the melted heap of various materials the HDD became but that the ~2500K is far, far above the Curie temperature of whatever and so the magnetism is just gone.  etc.

Don't do it. Read [Bitcoin isn’t the future of money — it’s either a Ponzi scheme or a pyramid scheme]( instead. Check the parent of my other answer in this thread as well.

As the [Washington Post]( said:

[citation needed]. The law requires people and businesses to *accept* local currency (which is the reason bitcoin is not a currency). It also requires salaries to be paid in the local currency (to avoid company scrip). But there's nothing banning anyone, person accepting euros, dollars or a cow in exchange for a shiny new Xeon chip, but equally they are not enforced to do so.

The phrase you are looking for is "monetary authority".
@_date: 2016-12-01 01:39:03
Yes, the libertarian insane wish of not having governments is projected onto reality by these guys. News flash: we do have governments and they have immense power and in this case, their power makes indeed worthless pieces of paper (at one time, pieces of playing cards were used in what is today Canada) something of worthy. Literally fiat means "let it become" and fiat money is the government decreeing "let this piece of paper become money". Not because of people's faith in their value but because the people's faith in the government. That this has been ongoing for a thousand years is complete missed by people believing blindly in bitcoins...

It simply doesn't work like that. People have a faith that the government will be a good custodian of their lives, money and so forth. Usually when they are not, they are overthrown, sooner or later.


England has been using sticks to collect taxes for 700+ years. Short lived.

Did you just Godwin this thread? That was quick. What I am hinting at is that bitcoin has noone in control and the everyday value swings are so high that it's useless as a currency. The very point of a monetary authority is to provide stability and in the overwhelming case they do. Aside from falling states day-to-day big changes are almost unheard of. In 1967 the British Pound was devalued by 14.3% and that counts as a rare, historical event. 14.3% is nothing in the world of bitcoin.

 will go live November 2017 and then you will be able to instantly settle across the 34 SEPA countries. It can't be helped the USA/Canada is behind by decades.
Bitcoin simply does not have any real world usage see for example   
@_date: 2016-10-08 16:03:05


How is it not?


If money would have the same fluctuations as bitcoin had the last few years there'd be a revolution or a revolt. Need historical examples?
@_date: 2016-10-23 19:29:19
Exactly, in Canada at least you can't use your money parked in investment funds because the value is uncertain. Before 2008 the bank used to allow it as collateral at 50% of current value.
