I'd lose one month's wage from when I invested. No big deal, wouldn't hurt me at all.

I'm not sure, but I have to say that I also started moving my assets off coinbase yesterday to hardware wallet.
only ethereum left, cause i need to look more into that on my trezor cause it doesn't seem as straight forward as the others.

Not sure that's necessary, most dutch/belgian people are fairly good at english, the french usually make their own sites/communities.

looks like I joined the 0 confirmation club, with fee 0.00176505 BTC

it didn't have any balance amount no. it just asked to fill in documents from a link, which I didn't click on, since the mail was too suspicious

Most replies are in the form of "it's your own fault for using mtgox", some people are pretty rude to the victims of mtgox here. So yeah not a lot of advice has been given about this issue. 
I'm not sure that reporting your passport stolen helps against hackers trying to prove they are you with the copy. I didn't lose much either at mtgox , but the information they had about me worries me as well. it's sad that you do not need all that much to prove to some companies that you are someone else.

oh , I posted at the same time , didn't notice yours , I got the same thing , also on non bitcoin related email address. it's just that in the header info i couldn't really see if it came from a fake domain. + the fact that mtgox hackers have my passport info could have made it true.
But the fact that your document nr is supposedly the same as mine (# 14327223) confirms it to be a phishing email.
Thx for posting this too , cleared it up for me :)

sometimes typos are deliberate to not waste time for the continuation of the scam with people that aren't dumb enough to fall for it till the end.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:13:48
i also got a phishing email coming from a mtgox.co domain instead of .com on an email address i don't really use for much else. So it's strange they suddenly know where to send it to.
Kinda worried about private info leaks from mtgox , since we had to send a lot of personal information for verification purposes.

if you followed the bitcoin subreddit links 'how to get bitcoins', mtgox was listed as the method to do so , just saying ...
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:57:39
he doesn't say he has it , he covered his bases by saying that he only checks if the email you ask for is in the so called 20% already sold list. 
So if you ask him any fake address , he supposedly looks in a a notepad file with 20% of the mtgox emails and ofcourse yours wont be in it, so he claims to have not sold the info yet. If he were to claim to be searching in the other 80% and claim he has your address , then he is 100% full of bullshit.

what about the german bank account? I sent my money to that one , last wednesday.
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:22:50
I did for EU transfer.

that would be very surprising considering the major issues the owner has. He should just concentrate on getting everyone their bitcoins and money back and retire bitcoin24. Personally, as soon as my deposited money is available on my account , i'll try anything to get them to another exchange. Not only can we not reach our funds atm, we've also lost out on a lot of profit that was to be made while we were locked out. Too much evidence points to how amateurish this was all setup. With the amount of cash involved, this is extremely risky.

The week I decided to get into this bitcoin adventure, I made an account at mtgox , but then saw there was a really long waiting period before you could transfer funds to buy bitcoins. Then I found another place to buy bitcoins in the "how to buy bitcoins" called bitcoin24. I wired over money, waited 2-3 days, nothing appeared in my account, then the site goes down, the owners bankaccounts closed and I've lost my money. So my experience with bitcoin so far has been rather shitty. 
I'd rather have been able to buy bitcoins and have them go down in price and then just wait.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:15:10
let me know how it goes.
@_date: 2013-06-10 11:04:23
I agree they are a pain to get. I missed all the good opportunities to buy when it crashed some time ago, because mtgox verification took 3+ weeks, i went to bitcoin24 instead after seeing how long it would take. Transfered money to it and it got all its accounts frozen. So now I had 2000 euro frozen in an account somewhere and still waiting on verification at mtgox. When that was finally done, i wired another 2000 euro to mtgox and that also took 2+ weeks to arrive. It definitely was a pain, in good news, it looks like I might see my 2000 euros from bitcoin24 again as they have released a press statement they will be transfering money back.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:52:27
can you atleast ask them to reverse the deposits on it (german bank) from the past days. cause mine only got sent wednesday and wasnt in my btc24 account yet. basicly the situation is rly rly bad.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:33:23
i'm not even getting a confirmation mail with login info from bitstamp, tried with 3 different emails from different domains
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:02:39
whoo , sell off soon to buy back in
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:19:21
that's like redesigning their site and blocking everyone's funds till they're done with it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 12:10:49
I had a wire transfer going to the german account since wednesday, the money wasn't on my bitcoin24 account yet, but it seems to be credited from my homebanking. So I hope it will still turn up somehow when the site is fixed. 
Let us know a timeframe as soon as possible. Already lost out on a lot of good opportunities.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:18:34
in same boat as you. transfered cash 2 days ago , was still waiting for it to show up on the bitcoin24 account, cause mtgox verfication is taking way too long.
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:16:46
oh boy, the more he writes, the less hopeful I get. It's like some 14-year old counterstrike kiddie was running this site :(
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:35:32
I asked my bank about what my options were to get my money back and they said to file a complaint with the police and then go to my bank with the police report about my complaint so they could try to get the money back from the german bank. I'm in a similar position , I wanted to buy bitcoins , first regged on mtgox , saw it would take 3 weeks to verify , then found a link to another big exchange on reddit , send funds there , didnt appear on account and then site went down and their accounts frozen. So my first experience with bitcoin so far is pretty shitty.
