The issue is whether we agree on July or October and has nothing to do with Wu. UASF is now in the hand of users and you just created another topic for people to disagree on. BIP148 sais Oct so unless you draft your own BIP **STFU** and run the Oct date as proposed in the BIP.

It doesn't matter if USAF has a minority hash rate. 
A "problem" arises if malicious miners choose to HF by stealing Bitcoin from a SW output. For the sake of simplicity lets assume the 36% of the miners that joined a UASF were one entity named Bob. The rate at which Bob finds blocks (blocks/day) wouldn't change. He would just be the only one extending the chain. So a hash rate split has **no direct effect** on mining reward. On the contrary due to slower confirmation times (28min) Bob would most likely receive higher tx fees!
The split at 36% is extremely attack resistant because in order to 51% attack this chain the malicious miners would have to dedicate 37% of the remaining 64% hashrate to attack the SW chain. They would collectively be cutting their profits in half (individually more like 100% loss, since they are not one entity and 51% isn't even enough to assure a consistent reorg/censorship attack), indefinitely hemorrhaging money. Only 27% would be extending the forked chain. Put aside the fact that 27% mining non-SW would cause a rush of miners to switch to what appears to be "the winning SW chain". Attackers would constantly be in danger of tipping the scale the opposite way.
If a well funded attacker actually managed to make the SW chain unusable over an extended period of time they would merely  be aligning incentives on the SW side to change POW. Again they will have spent a lot of money achieving nothing. Bitcoin's incentives remain in tact. If we see wide USAF adoption among full nodes and exchanges I would be very comfortable to give miners a kick in the ass to wake them up. Because as it stands with UASF they have nothing to gain and everything to lose.
Come USAF flag day. Either my node stops working because it sees no new blocks (no miner mining sw) in which case I have to forfeit. Or my node starts receiving SW blocks. At which point the ball is in the remaining miners court to choose what they want to do. Continue mining for profit or crash the entire economy by HFing and then further decreasing their revenue by attacking my chain.

UASF will never be an "official" thing after all it's a **user** activated SF. This needs grass roots support from the community. If you truly want SegWit, you have to run a BIP148 full node, use it and convince exchanges, services, wallet providers and miners to do so too.

@_date: 2017-03-25 14:39:23
If UASF doesn't reach the required adoption by Oct it never will. BIP148 is based on the current SWSF signaling period. If we let Oct pass there is no telling how much coordination will be required to get to the same spot we are right now.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:32:38
If the chain splits with 80:20 one of two things will happen.
The entire network grinds to a halt if no replay protection is in place as no body want's to lose any money no matter where.
tx fees on BTC will increase due to high demand and low supply while tx fees on BU crash due to low demand and high supply. Bitcoin will continue to function even if we found 24 blocks per day instead of 144. On the contrary, this situation would be perfect to start working on SW activation.
This event will set precedent. BU marketcap will wither almost instantly, without any correlation to tx fees, as people realize that Bitcoin's value doesn't lie in "cheaper than Paypal tx fees" but in its permission-less, immutable, global and decentralized ability to transfer value. None of which is preserved on Ver and Wus chinaBU chain.
That being said I am open and very happy to be proven wrong. Though I highly doubt BUers even have the balls to fork in the first place... I'd finally rid myself of the curse of being right all the time.

I never claimed to be a miner. Go ahead and UASF in a month. I'm not doing jack shit until exchanges, businesses and users show even the slightest interest. Even if they do BIP148 is Oct. So I'll UASF in Oct in concordance with BIP148. You are no better than BU shills.

Exchanges won't accept a chain that fraudulently spends a SW output for the same reason they wont list BU. It creates chaos, a shitty altcoin no matter the hashrate, violates the principles of Bitcoin and has no replay protection.

@_date: 2017-03-25 16:22:37
You are correct I was off on some other tangent in my head.
UASF would need replay protection incase it has &lt;50% hashrate. That wouldn't solve non-UASFs reorg issues though. In the end non-UASF has to move either way. Either accept peoples right to features that they can choose not to use. Or add reorg protection and replay protection if they reject the right. No compelling reason not to UASF.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:02:31

Fails in what way? To activate entirely or fails to retain a single blockchain?
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:09:08
The SW-attacking chain (USAF doesn't fork the chain. a malicious miner does) would need replay and reorg protection otherwise exchanges wouldnt list it, regarless of hashrate. The UASF chain would be fine.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:36:03
BIP148 is drafted in a way that it gives miners the full SF activation period to signal. It forces activation in the last week. There is only this one timeframe to achieve UASF. Anything beyond the current timetable will suffer under more coordination problems.

If this is what it's **really** worth to transmit 1k USD with the legacy Banking system, I'd pay twice as much to have the tx go through a global, decentralized, permissionless, uncensorable, anonymous\* and fungible\* blockchain.
Bitcoin will always have a higher value to me than legacy banking. As such I'd always be willing to pay higher tx fees. Fortunately transfering 1000USD isn't worth 100USD as Bitcoin has demonstrated in the past.

Core proponents aren't interested in performing a hardfork for the sole purpose of raising the block size to 2MB. 
BU proponents aren't interested in anything else besides their untested and unpredictable EC concept.
A 2MB HF does nothing for anybody and hence isn't being considered by anyone.
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:41:09
Bitcoin isn't anonymous and the blocksize is an instigated attack to divert attention from more important issues such as **fungibility and privacy**.

SW doesn't change the consensus rules of the Protocol it just adds to them. While it is technically possible to steal anyone-can-spend utxos doing so will fork you of the network today, as it will in the future regardless of SWUASF.  It's always the ones initiating the attack that are forking. It's easy to tell the difference as simply using SW will never fork the chain.

First - This claim is unsubstantiated, frivolously trivial and illiterate in nature.. 
Second - More efficient use of a resource leads to an increased rate of consumption: [Jevons Paradox](
Third - Promoting an increase of blocksize(supply) to meet growing demand while simultaneously fearing a decrease of fees due to more efficient use (LN) is a textbook case of cognitive dissonance.

Next time precedent will have already been set in that SW activation has failed once already. This will not make it easier. Devs will never add a UASF to the reference client because it's a USER activated soft fork. Oct is the prime time for Users to achieve anything. Letting it pass is a mistake.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:11:55
No. BIP148 gives miners the full SWSF activation period to resolve the issue on their own. the Oct date is based on the current SWSF singaling process. Suggesting to move it ahead would just cause more infighting because people wouldn't agree to when. Tomorrow? In a week? June or July? It's stupid to even consider moving it up.

If someone decides to mine a SW attack block he will fork the network as BU would fork the network with &gt;1MB blocks. The fact that they have no replay protection, reorg protection and that some mines DGAF and just follow them is their own problem.
The reasons for exchanges to reject listing a SW-attack chain are in line with the reasons for not listing BU. It's an altcoin no matter the hashrate and without a clean fork would cause chaos. SW as UASF is a zero risk option at best or a BU option with the ball in the miners court at worst. They want BU? Let em have it. They wan't a worthless sw-attack chain? let them have it. See how far they get.

The average consumer can use paypal. Bitcoin has a certain set of features that distinctly differ from traditional payment methods and currencies. 
If a product's unique value proposition is eroded there is no reason for anyone to prefer it over anything else. Bitcoin's unique value proposition is financial sovereignty for the individual. Entirely trust-less, uncensorable, global, peer to peer transfer of sound money. 
This value proposition isn't what the "average" consumer gives a shit about when he decides to buy the new apple iphone or a coffee at starbucks. The average consumer can use dogecoin, because for all I care there isn't much of value that sets DOGE apart from ETH.

Profit needs to be higher. Not price. Contrary to what shills and AstroTurfers are attempting to make everyone believe &gt;95% of 20B USD are invested in Bitcoin, not in chinaVerCoin. When the chain splits due to a single miner or two acquiring 80% hash rate anyone left with the belief that people will dump BTC for BTU has entirely lost it. Most of the market, aside form the incredibly loud and partially well financed, illiterate minority of fools Ver managed to convince, will dump BTU because it literally is worthless. It's buggy, it's untested, it has no one writing code for it, no one aside from Ver and Wu even **pretend** to use it. It doesn't solve anything and only creates problems.

There is no endling this conflict because the conflict isnt about blocksize. It's about governance.

They parrot meaningless slogans such as "decentralized development", "many competing implementations", etc. I can imagine what Bitcoin would look like with dozens of BU-like, consensus incompatible clients run by a myriad of web developers who regularly display blatant disregard for even the most rudimentary concepts in computer science.
