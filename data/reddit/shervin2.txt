Given time and the proper asset features, a cryptocurrency most definitely can replace fiat/paper money. We're a long way off but it is going to happen, maybe in a form we haven't discovered yet.
It'll replace paper money by rendering it completely obsolete, we've seen this happen to different things hundreds of times in history.

I understand what you are saying, but Bitcoin and it's alternative's are not going to simply vanish due to banks playing the bully role.
At some point, a bank will see Bitcoin as a competitive advantage and reap massive rewards from it, and eventually, this will cascade to other banks. It's not a matter of if, but when.
Bitcoin is too disruptive and too game changing for it to be ostracized by banks. One of them will pick it up and run with it.
Also, whats stopping a bunch of wealthy Bitcoiners from making their own bank? Nothing.

2% is ridiculously high, especially if you're considering it to be high volume. If you implement zero trading fees, you can always take percentages of deposits/withdrawals.

Hmm, Tim Cook just cashed out today too... they knew this was coming...
@_date: 2013-11-12 09:34:33
Hey dude, I'll buy quite a bit of BitCoin from you if you're looking to sell. Drop me a line.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:23:15
They deposit into Canadian banks as well?
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:36:47
You need help, NOW.
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:35:28
People are doing it, it's called arbitrage :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:11:43
Not yet, but it soon will be.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:33:16
Works for me
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:04:32
No buy support since it's a weekend. You'll see Bitcoin skyrocket in the weekdays since everyone will want to buy after the crash.
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:05:28
Wow, much thanks. 164DYPka2EiD4DvXqtE4qjwbHrzpC6hWhQ

Arize Chicken Branson, Arize!

The reason why the SR crash wasn't a real crash, was because the bitcoin was lost and was never sold on the market. The crash would have been way worse if this was true.

Fontas is his name, being an asswipe is his game.

That's Tony Galippi!

I would split the 0.1 into how many Facebook friends I have, then message them asking them to install the Bitcoin app and receive their first transfer!
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:16:48
Historically speaking, weekends have been the worst for Bitcoin. Not much buy support, so many people sell and the price drops.
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:49:58
The more she goes up and down, the more the price does!
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:25:44
This is bad methinks.

Cocaine is a helluva drug.

The other 6.5 billion make $10 a day. Get real dude.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:05:10
In Canada and it works fine.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:55:46
It's China. They don't have any rampant buy support nowadays.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:03:13
$600, no lower.
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:47:15
Moron, the page you linked to PROVES that NSA does not have backdoor access to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:08:44
Not as much buying volume as a while back, but they're still in it. Let's hope they ease on the regulations instead of clamping down even harder.
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:35:42
You mean the next way to ask for ransom money? Cool!
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:17:34
It's just you.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:20:35
You think pot is a drug? lulz!
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:12:44
This isn't the fucking trollbox.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:13:44
Bitcoin is bitcoin. Gold is gold.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:05:43
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:15:40
This worries me.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:52:56
That's the worst photoshop work I have ever seen.
@_date: 2013-12-30 06:26:17
In other words, China today has revealed it's space program destined for the moon, again!
@_date: 2013-12-09 11:55:15
Yes, from the looks of it.

You sir, are going to die.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:37:59
I have the hotline right here for you.
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:28:42
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:44:57
Without music for sure.
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:21:50
Take the SR model and make it public.
AFAIK no one has done it yet.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:06:40
More like just a normal day on the BTC-e trollbox.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:33:16
They're all reeling from yesterdays loss.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:32:12
You're delusional, pal.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:35:29
It's purely on speculation at this point, but the most logical city for a company to roll out it's ATM nation wide, after Vancouver is Toronto. I don't see them going any where else.
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:31:26
He's a fool and he's going to dump it all soon.
@_date: 2013-12-30 05:41:18
He likes to toot his own horn too now? Wow.
