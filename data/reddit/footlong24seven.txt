This is all based on the assumption BTC is going to continue to grow 400% per year. That's unrealistic, at some point it becomes too expensive and when the buyers dry up there is only one way for it to go.

Next resistance 8.5/8.6k. I'm a trader and this has all the green lights. Enjoy the ride and dont forget to set exit points. Monday could be another big push given the financial market conditions.

For real. BTC is an asset not money. Hate to burst your bubbles (readers, not you specifically), but 70% of global debt transactions are in USD. A Frenchman can make a contract with a Chinese company in USD. The Fed has no oversight of this. You can't do this with Japanese Yen. Additionally, 70% of the CASH dollars exist *outside* the US. The USD is an absolute store of wealth in China, South America...everywhere.
Gold, BTC, Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate are all ASSETS which are exchanged for MONEY. Money is always on the other side and the bulk of money is in debt. How much does BTC pay in a bond? Dividend? Rent? BTC is more like gold or commodities in the sense that it has no yield on your investment.
Your dollar doesn't go up 13% in a day and now buys you 13% more stuff than it did yesterday. It's money because it's the medium of exchange. Hence your salary doesn't fluctuate.
When was the last time someone bought coffee in BTC? Anyone?

OK so BTC is racing up and you're going to use it to buy coffee? Most people, the 10-15% of us that even buy BTC, are doing so because we want to profit off the run up. Everyone is holding so that it goes up. That makes it a speculative asset. Don't deny what it is. Even if one guy in a million uses it to buy stuff, the majority sees this as nothing more than buying a stock that doesn't pay dividends.

Maybe tomorrow I'll do an exhaustive technical analysis post to show you guys why this is in melt-up mode. I'm on your side here.

Yes, exit to USD. Bitcoin is an asset and USD is rising. The vast majority of global transactions takes place in USD. BTC will not replace USD any time soon. BTC is not money any more than a share of Apple is money. It's funny when you hear the gold bugs scream why BTC is not money - their own arguments can be used for gold. Money is always on the opposite side of assets.
Contrary to what you may think, the strong USD is what's setting the world up for a major rebalancing. It's not the collapse of the dollar, but the fact that it's the only game in town and makes up over 70% of global debt transactions that's going to cause a currency crisis. When EM currencies tank [they will go to the Dow Jones and buy the trophies]( (AAPL, AMZN, etc.).
