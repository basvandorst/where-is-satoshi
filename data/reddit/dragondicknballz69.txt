Has Coinbase ever had problems where they may be shut down?

As the price rises and you spend your bitcoin it’s almost like whatever you bought was free because your bitcoin is still worth same as it was before you purchased

Is the top not technically correct? Segwit is being added to the original bitcoin chain where as bitcoin cash is just making it bigger no lightening network

Coinbase is instant so fees and higher price you buy it from coinbase. On gdax if you set limit trades it’s no fee you and trading with someone selling

Same, never invest what you can't afford to lose or don't need for a few months
