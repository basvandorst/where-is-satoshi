RIP Bitcoin.
But really this is going to be very interesting to see how the price reacts.
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:24:49
I meant in the longer term.  Over the next few days/weeks/months.

China wants a word.
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:34:36
I'm not worried.  In fact I'm gonna buy more.
My point was depending on how fast the price recovers will be very telling about the overall health of bitcoin and how much it is actually relying on china.

You also don't get it.

From what I understand the Monday is only for filings.  It is believed they will rule today.  I also read historically they either release their ruling between 6-9am or 2-5pm.

It happened literally instantly too.  Was nuts.

The only thing he is wrong about is that is better.
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:53:50
It is expensive difficult and pointless.
@_date: 2017-03-02 22:47:49
That is actually kinda an awesome idea.
Sadly actually getting something to land on the moon is probably quite difficult.

I have and is a cesspool of crying man children, it is a very toxic place.  But deletes anything that isnt pro core or I asked a question the other day about BU and it got immediately deleted.  When I PMd the mods asking why I didnt get a response.
And that was a simple question.  If they micromanage to that extent then what else are they deleting?
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:05:33
You should probably sell everything.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:15:39
Yes.  It has literally never happened from what I understand.  They always rule.
@_date: 2017-03-16 08:19:33
Buckle in boys.  Here we go.

He prob means ETH 24hr.

Hmm hold on guys.

The cost of the complicated miner is significantly higher than the cost of an efficient heater.

Any transactions that happen on an exchange will be easily tracked though no?

I'm not so sure.  There have been a couple of big drops in recent times but the prices have very quickly recovered.  The bitfinex hack is a good example.
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:23:27
Your example strikes me as odd. You compared a technology that has existed for 30 years to one that has existed for thousands. Do you see any problems in that?
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:13:21
Like an account number?
@_date: 2016-12-13 02:02:40
This is truly beautiful.  Thank you.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:55:41
For sure?
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:08:54
I'm assuming you are heavily invested in alt coins? :D
