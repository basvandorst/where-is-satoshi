Why not use a stop loss and buy back in at a lower price once it starts picking back up?

I'm curious, How do you create a private address and set of keys to go with it without first checking to make sure the address is not already taken? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:23:54
It's a finite number and well [this already happened](

Have you ever given up on one of those captchas that makes you pick 50 items out of a photo to prove your a human. Humans don't don't give up or have timeouts.

It's estimated that 50% of the users are bots in this social experiment.

Your not kidding. Considering it is a market that is unregulated and susceptible to manipulation. The is high volume churning and wash trading happening that is unprecedented. who is the spoofy.  Eventual there will be a squeeze, always be ready to bail.

How many war casualties in the last 100  years are due to religious zelots. Now how many caused by crypto. Oh wait I get it, your one of the ones from the bottom half of the picture, carry on then.

Holy fuck, I've seen some dumb shit but this is up there with the guy that refinanced to buy in right before the last bubble popped.

Well for a while hoddor was chanted on this site like a freakin mantra. Sometime ofter the bubble popped it changed to hodler I guess for bag holders, which in the bigger picture paid off for them. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:00:59
Go fork yourself. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 00:59:04

I was about to go ballistic for the moon phrase and then saw the gif. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:27:08
It's funny because it's likely they were trading using some of the actual btc they lost in gox and didn't even know it, double goxed, and now goxed again. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:55:55
I wouldn't trust coinbases numbers. They enable two factor on accounts locking people out. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:30:46
For forks sake. Get forked. Fork off. Go fork yourself. Fork you, you forking fork!
