You don't get bitcoin. Most people make transactions in smaller units such as mbtc and satoshi. You're a child of the old world my friend. Either get with it or get left behind.

Couldn't you use data recovery software?

Exactly what I'm saying. All these idealists are living in a fantasy. Everything gets controlled eventually.

If you're just testing the waters and mucking about with bitcoin then an online wallet is fine. When you invest $100+ on bitcoin then it's probably time to get a desktop wallet. The only time I'll think about getting a hardware wallet is if I have over 1 grand in coins. You're right, people love complicating things. The average joe doesn't give a flying shizer about the inner workings of bitcoin,it's just something to play around with and that's coming from an average joe.

If you're holding, best to just ignore the price chart and check back in 5 years.
that is all

Well the general rule is buy low sell high, but it's been a few weeks now and the value has barely dropped. I'm not sure what to do either. Even if it does drop I doubt it's going to be significant. Might pull the trigger now.

Wouldn't it be smart to sell a tiny percentage of your bitcoin now so you make some money when it drops? Holding everything doesn't seem logical but I'm no expert.

Are you against it? Seems like an easy way of making money. Holding everything seems pointless but I'm no expert.

That's exactly why holding itself is somewhat risky. Might as well just spend some now, diversify into over crypto, buy a house, buy a car... shit, that's what I would do.
