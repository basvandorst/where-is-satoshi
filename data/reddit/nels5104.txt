What about the insurance aspect?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:25:15
This ignores any form of collapse that would make mining rather useless. The idea that miners would keep it afloat because they are invested is silly. You’re saying miners would spend all of their money trying to save bitcoin but what happens when that doesn’t work?
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:11:27
He may be an idiot on a ton of issues but the market has been very positive since he took office. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:06:10
So... you still need worthless fiat?
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:45:56
Taking a loan to gamble is a horrible idea. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:31:07
So you are saying that if the crash were to occur, miners would mine at a loss indefinitely? If faith does not come back then eventuallyu, the loss is total.  Mining rigs can be repurposed. 
Stocks have gone to zero with people holding tons of it. Just because there is not a buyer, doesn’t mean it cannot devalue. 
I’m not saying that there will never be a market for BTC as it will always have use for nefarious purposes. That doesn’t dictate the level of the floor, though. It could fall back to dollars a coin and still be useful to a point. But widespread adoption is unlikely if that happens. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:18:07
Wouldn’t everything have to devalue proportionally, though? Otherwise you are making a division but keeping the value of everything the same? I guess this rides on the assumption that bitcoin value will continue to increase.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:16:30
False. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:04:35
Seems pretty common here
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:24:32
My apologies. I misread your original comment and thought you stated that multiple people do this. Trump, yeah.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:21:37
How will that happen? You need a lot more people of your side before you can begin to fathom pushing the gov’t around. I don’t see that happening
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:00:58
It’s pretty silly 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:28:35
Yeah, that not how it actually works. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:41:48
We have a winner!
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:47:37
I thought my last statement was fairly clear.
If you don’t have the money to lose, don’t gamble it. It’s that simple. 
Edit:  and there is nothing wrong with paying with a credit card. Almost Every transaction that I make is done with a credit card so that I can get the rewards. But I actually have the money in my bank account to cover the cost without needing to wait until next week to get paid to cover the cost. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:26:18
Care to buy scrap iron from the Lisk Tower?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:17:11
Whatever you spend on the credit card needs to be paid back which makes it a loan, regardless of the interest.
So, like I originally stated, taking a loan to gamble is not very smart. Buying bitcoin is essentially gambling right now. Risk what you can lose. If you need to borrow money to gamble, you cannot afford to gamble. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:48:57
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:12:39
This isn’t the place for such logic.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:45:23
But... but... bitcoin /s
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:54:09
Because it’s not instant 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:48:35
Why don’t they just spend their bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:15:29
You think South Koreans is getting involved in BTC because of North Korea? The threat of NK has been there since the armistice. The constant barking across the DMZ is nothing new.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:21:29
Bonds?? You mean the bonds that are valued in USD? Everything you stated is valued with the USD. When it deflates, so does the equity. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:36:37
But the walls that bitcoin has run in to has to be solved by individuals, and the way of solving the issues differs within the community. That is why the fork occurred. Other cryptos solve issues differently so it is like a company. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:33:43
It’s a similar trend, the numbers don’t need to match.  Bubbles can burst at any time. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:08:13
What shit storm?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:19:48
It’s true, though. People won’t want to buy back in a second time knowing that it could crash again. If it crashes, it will crash for good.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:18:16
That’s a great way to gain support! 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:27:48
But fraud is insured by the CC company.  That’s the perk of CCs.  If I get in to a dispute that cannot be rectified then I have a course of action that can be taken with my CC company.

They meant Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:52:35
You seem pretty damn sure of something that is not a guarantee. I’m merely stating facts. You are speculating, big difference. I think your stake in BTC might affect the way you view the entire situation. That coupled with the fact that you sitting in an echo chamber. 
And I never said that BTC is going to crash, only what will happen IF it does. You and all of the other bitcoin holders are in such defense mode that you lash out at anyone who has anything negative to say about it. Level your head, dude. It will do you some good. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:56:36
I never said using a credit card as a payment method was bad. Using credit to gamble is bad. Which is what I said in the beginning... go back and read what I said. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:25:56
Explain, oh wise one. 
Edit:  I relayed my experience in a foreign country to you and you don’t seem to like that it is fact. That’s your problem.
And I never had an original point, this was my first post in this portion of this thread.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:00:07
Ah... right. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:45:01
So you think that the prices in shops will drop if credit cards go away?
Edit: Also, it’s nice having insurance on a purchase. If I get ripped off on an online transaction with a crypto, what’s my course of action to be reimbursed? I’m legit curious. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:03:08
The 1000 people that own 40% of it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:47:43
It absolutely is. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:59:54
I wouldn’t call it public knowledge. And I ain’t buying it without a source. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:49:35
But by adding more decimals, it’s essentially raising the cap. It’s no longer finite then because you can add more layers of division until the cows come home.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:46:36
I have never said that Zimbabwe or other so called 3rd world countries don’t have their beauties. I know they do. My beef with your original comment is that the US is nothing but corporate greed. Yeah, it is a part of the US but it does not define it.  It’s ridiculous and along the same lines of thinking Africa is nothing but a large shithole.
And of course I don’t believe the American way of life is the only way to live or even the best, it definitely has many shortcomings but doesn’t change the fact that it is still a great place to live. To say that it is the last place you would choose to live is a gross misstatement that I can’t fathom even you believing to be true.
I’d suggest you consider booking a holiday to the US and have a see for yourself. Visit a small town, spend some time the locals and you’ll see that government is not reflected in our people (not all anyhow).
Sure, the US leaves much to be desired but to define it by it’s government is silly. 
Edit: and to suggest everyone would sell their grandma for $$.. well you can fuck right off with that bullshit.

Not quite but I was able to use USD at a small town market in the hills of Peru, they were happy to accept it. In fact, the locals explained that all large purchases (housing, cars, etc.) are transacted in USD because it is a stable currency. The Peruvian Soles isn’t quite as stable.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:03:53

All cryptos, like it or not, are tied together and their prices fluctuate very much with one another. So diversifying within cryptos isn’t a safe play
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:04:40
lol, oooookay. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:35:07
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:38:26
I think you are delusional to think that it could rebound from a total crash, which is what I said. BTC needs widespread acceptance to be sustained, no one with half a brain will touch something that rose 2000% and dropped that same amount in a year. The technology will be recycled, sure. It’s brilliant. But BTC won’t survive. 
Edit: autocorrect
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:16:38
I guess I was referring to BTC, not BCH
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:52:16
So then the person/entity that you transfer the bitcoin to can turn around and instantly spend that bitcoin on something else? They don’t have to wait for the confirmation first?

I suppose you’ve been to the US and are not just basing your opinion on, dare I say it, propaganda. Hypocrite much. 
Every country has flaws but to say that you’d rather live in NK is such an obvious shill comment. It discredits anything else you say.

How is bitcoin like the internet in that analogy?
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:28:15
I was pointing out that if you don’t have the funds and you are opening up a credit card with the sole purpose of using it buy crypto then that is a bad choice. You’re right, it doesn’t matter what means you use to buy it, if you have the money. But OP said he didn’t and then someone suggested him getting a second credit card to do so, which I said was a bad idea. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:13:05
I’d be interested in the correct explanation. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:56:07
Naturally, your pain is warranted.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:53:59
All crypto backers rail on fiat because it can be printed but wouldn’t dividing bitcoins further be the same damn thing?

Count yourself as blessed and call it a day. If the guilt will really bother you, donate the money. That’s a life changing amount so do with it what you will.

Twice. They do eat some weird things but I’m standing by my original statement. Cloned dick meat is just too far gone. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:16:52
That’s not a fair comparison. Compare the market caps and amounts of money flowing.

Absolutely. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:05:30
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:09:23
My understanding is the transaction should be in the ledger? So can’t you just look at who sent it to you? I may be wrong but that was my understanding. If not, count yourself blessed because you’ll get everyone under the sun claiming it was there’s and you’ll never know the truth.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:02:24

@_date: 2018-09-13 17:02:06
You missed the joke, it’s okay, it happens. It’s better to just admit it than carry on like you are. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:04:25
It was in response to OP. Bitcoin isn’t going to stop wars. People have been warring as long as people have been around. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:47:30
When was there a $30 peak that then took over 2 years to reach $30 again?
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:21:49
I don’t see the word *more* in OPs post. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:05:47
For what it’s worth, it was a good attempt. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:55:44
But people aren’t really using bitcoin as a currency as much as a store of value. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:20:14
I can freeze my accounts any time I want, that’s not news.  You didn’t answer the question, you deflected.

Why wouldn’t you pay the taxes on your earnings?

That made me laugh, because the comment is so stupid

I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life. And it was this post, right here, that made me so convinced.

A cc is not a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:51:03
Serious question. How do people in the poorest countries who live without electricity use a digital currency?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:10:45
This is the roughly the way that I see it.
In order for the bitcoin to truly succeed, the US government must topple. And if that happens, which currency is relevant is going to the least of everyone’s worries.
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:35:37
This is no place for reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:29:16
People that are knowledgeable apply that knowledge.
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:55:36
There is so much wrong with your idea of inflation. You guys and your “inflation is theft” idea makes me see how little you understand about basic economics... 
A dollar is a dollar is a dollar. I don’t have the time or the care to explain basic economics to you so all I can do is suggest you educate yourself before spewing anymore bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:04:07
Can’t you then just send it back to whomever sent it to you?
@_date: 2018-09-12 16:37:02
But the government was the subject here

That’s not how making profits works. It’s purchasing power isn’t changing.

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:25:44
You are free to purchase a piece land in bumfuck nowhere and build your own existence. But if you live in the US, you need to pay taxes on your earnings. If you don’t, they’ll find out and your profits will sit there untouched while you sit in jail.
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:03:04
Ah... the price of goods has remained pretty steady against the USD. So is the USD becoming worth that much more? Or every major stable currency? When did bitcoin become the benchmark? Do you understand economics at all?
The delusion with some of you bitcoiners. I’m not sure whether to laugh at or pity you. 
It isn’t worth arguing with stupid. Enjoy whatever the hell it is that makes you tick.

I just think your whataboutism example being Christmas lights is silly. To say I don’t care about electricity is a hell of stretch but I don’t have to tell you that because you already know. You’re just frustrated and are afraid to backpedal on you’re goofy attack on Christmas lights.

Buying a house and investing are two different things. Also, a house is an asset while the mortgage is a liability. Not many people can buy outright so they get a mortgage. The other alternative is to rent, which is a liability. Not everyone views their house as an investment. But the house is an asset. 
I’m guessing you read *Rich Dad, Poor Dad*.
Edit: I should clarify that it isn’t always cut and dry. Some houses can be a money pit and certainly turn in to a liability. But on the flip side, they can be sold for profit. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:36:52

You (and a lot of others around this sub) have such a narrow view on this subject. You feel like a fiat collapse will be quiet and everyone will “wake up” to crypto and life will be good again. Wrong. If the banks and fiat fail... war will break out on a global scale. Many, many will die. No one will care about those who held crypto and now have a lot of it. It will be as useless as a raincoat in the desert. The world will crumble before it is rebuilt. Maybe something such as crypto will rise from the ashes but it certainly won’t be the one that existed before the big war.

This being my point. Electricity is wasted every day in vast quantities by countless different things. Christmas lights is a funny example. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 13:17:29
And you think this paradox will ring true for bitcoin? This intangible crypto that is ultimately owned by a very small group of people?
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:01:15
This is credit card fraud... you said your bank was robbed. Which is it? Your credit card number was stolen? Your bank account was drained? 
If your card is stolen, you dispute it. It’s pretty simple, dude. 
Did you just google stolen money and post the first thing that popped up to support your claim?
@_date: 2018-08-23 21:34:25
Oh, you. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 23:44:59
Nah. I made my point clear a few posts ago. There was nothing unclear about it. You’re just frustrated and can’t let it go. 
Edit: Also, the blanket statement that I hate electricity was pretty funny as well. Just like your disdain for Christmas lights.

Okay, dude. You are the investment king. I’m sure it’s what you do for a living and have made everyone you know rich because you know exactly how to invest the best. lol
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:32:16
Right. But that doesn’t stop him from having another address which he used to mine coins early. That would be a smart play. He could have mined a lot of bitcoin very early and sold them off.
@_date: 2018-08-24 21:03:23
Now I’ve got deja vu. Funny, isn’t it?
@_date: 2018-08-16 02:48:17
I feel like I can’t explain myself any clearer. How do you know that Satoshi did not mine coins himself? He leaves his original 2 million coins Untouched and mines bitcoins early on to another bitcoin address. It’s possible to have multiple wallets, no? He then sells these coins. It’s an easy concept to grasp. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:24:17

You’re right in that it was a large mix of different factors. I just didn’t like the simplicity of the original comment stating the US got to be the nation that it is due to slavery (and I suppose the “American industry was bootstrapped by slavery”).

The original post you made that I was responding to claims that the creator did not get any fame or *riches* from it. And I’m saying that is not necessarily true. The fame, no. The riches, possibly.

It is a simplification that is accurate. It is the first domino in the chain of events that preceded their massive economic crisis. The banks over-lended because they had enormous debts to pay back and no other country would lend to them.
Sure, the banks hyper-inflated but it was a direct result of the war.
Don’t let your hate for banks blind you on chain of events that lead to the crisis.

It’s not a bank. It’s a credit card. Your card was issued by the bank but the network runs through a credit card company. And mine was resolved instantly. The money was charged back to my card and the only inconvenience was getting a new card issued.

Oh jeez, I don’t know... just the slightest bit of research suggests...
Demand outpacing supply (demand-pull), higher costs of materials driving up prices (cost-push), higher wages for workers driving up the cost of business, profit pushing... the list goes on. 
Increased money supply affects inflation, sure... but it is not the main contributor. It is the main contributor in a lot of economic collapses but it isn’t here and now.

It’s not subjective to say that not all debt is bad. It’s a fact. Just because you don’t agree doesn’t make it any less so. 
Feel free to answer my simple question any time you like. How can the majority of people buy a house without a loan? I don’t expect an answer because I genuinely feel that you have no idea. And it frustrates you that can’t answer it but you don’t want to admit that you don’t know.

At one time, I had a general interest in it so I came here to see some dialogue. And I see a lot of posts about fiat is for sheep and how everyone who uses banks or mortgages are idiots. How bitcoiners will rule the world and everyone else is dumb for not believing in it and they will soon wallow in their own tears for not buying in sooner.  Well, that rubs some people the wrong way, so expect some backlash and trolling when it doesn’t go your way.

@_date: 2018-11-15 14:40:36
That Silver, though. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:16:55
Because you made the argument for silver and gold over bullets are being valuable. You didn’t even hint at guns being worth anything. Why would I draw any other conclusion?
You make the assumption that everyone wants gold and silver and will play by the rules. That surpluses of essential goods will be common so bartering will be easy. Well, that isn’t realistic. Everything will become scarce and then everything will need to be protected by force. 
The only difference between the haves and have nots will be guns/bullets. If this was 1200 AD and the population was relatively small, sure, different story.  But populations are too dense now. 
Honestly, after your wild assumption that I would be one of the poor in an apocalyptic situation, you completely lost me.  
As far as comparing millennia past to an apocalyptic situation taking place today, you can’t. Sure, we wouldn’t have power same as the old days but that is where the similarities stop. Most people don’t have the basic survival skills that carried everyone back then. Those in the rural areas would fair the best until overflow urban folks spilled in to their area. Then what? They hold hands and break bread together? Maybe the first few that come along. But what about the next waves of people. No. The farmers tell them to fuck right off. How do they make them do that? With guns. Gold won’t matter at all then. 
A lot of you have a very unrealistic idea of what would happen in an apocalyptic scenario. Chaos and death, that’s what will happen on a massive scale. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:26:27

Pray do tell how bitcoin will end credit-debt. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:28:52
Of course those who have the guns that match the bullets will fair the best.  That’s not really the point. Those with guns typically have several different sorts and bullets will be very valuable. Without a bullet, a gun is just a hunk of metal. 
Also, Who cares about gold or silver in an apocalyptic situation? You can have all the gold you want but if someone that is armed wants your food or clothes, you ain’t keeping them.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:47:20

This twitter post had nothing to do with freedom. It stated that ideas are immortal and that just isn’t true.  And there are a lot of slaves around the world, it’s still a very large problem. 
And how is someone who wears a suit and lives a comfortable life a slave? Because they don’t agree with your views about world finance?

I think this is the reason that it doesn’t and won’t have mainstream adaptation any time soon. It’s just too complicated for most people to want to investigate. People don’t want to have to sit and learn about how to use a currency. It should be simple to use.

You severely underestimate the consequences of the power grid going down. Give the book “One Second After” a read. Gives you a small sense of the utter chaos that can and probably would ensue. 
Edit: Also, all electronic devices would be destroyed so any form on power would be worthless. Phones and tablets would be the least of everyone’s worries. Food and water would be the new gold. And guns.

Yeah... I didn’t agree to that speed limit sign so I’ll be damned if I’m paying any speeding tickets. What’s that? I didn’t agree to spend time in jail. I think I’ll just take my leave. 
Yup, that’s how it works. If you don’t agree, it ain’t right. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:23:38
The idea of Bitcoin is better, it hasn’t proven it yet. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:48:42
The irony. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 22:57:35
That’s not a Ponzi scheme. Please try again.
If you want to actually use words to tell me why you believe it is, I’m all ears. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:24:05
But that’s not the reality of what will take place in a transition to bitcoin. It won’t just slide in to place and replace fiat. It will have to destroy it and with that, everyone’s savings, investment will go with it. Not everyone will want the change and those who don’t will lose it all. In this scenario, of course.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:46:51
... wow. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:04:11
See dotcom bubble. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:50:50
It’s literally in the top left corner of the video...
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:14:21
You guys going to jerk each other off all day?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:45:37
The market is in need of a correction, absolutely. It has been for a while now. You know that if the USD devalues, BTC does too.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:51:58
Bravo, sir. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:02:56
Damn, that’s cringey.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:21:19
So this backs up my claim. It isn’t the 19th century anymore, the meaning has changed. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:19:21
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:08:45
Impelling argument.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:39:28
You’re right.  But a lot of idioms have morphed and no longer make sense. But they are what they are now and to point out to someone that they misused the phrase while citing its meaning from a hundred years ago is a bit unfair. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:49:32
But if BTC price vs. USD is dropping, it would ultimately mean that BTC is devaluing at a quicker pace. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:03:07
The chart? You mean that kindergarten drawing? That’s not a reason.
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:58:31
lol, damn you are delusional.
Edit: nah, just a troll. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:32:28
To... to make more money.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:01:01
Abbreviating 420 to 4... interesting. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 21:21:51
Stanley nickels.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:14:37
That’s not what that phrase means. It means getting trough a tough situation by one’s own effort. It has never meant an impossible task. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 15:01:35
What the fuck are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:29:45
So you’re 15 now?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:59:23
You really don’t get it, do you? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:07:28
 But don’t most bitcoiners hope for fiat collapse so they can be rich in BTC? That would mean untold millions of people losing pretty much everything. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:02:01
I... I don’t know what the hell this means in reference to the above post.
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:25:31
I didn’t read that anywhere in the post... 
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:03:38
Usually I find the statement, “if you don’t like it, leave” to be ridiculous. But if you truly feel the way that you just expressed, you should probably find a different place to live. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:50:11
I remember learning about 3 men who pumped millions in to the failing market in 1929 to try to prop it back up. It did not end well for them. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:07:51
Because nothing exists at that price...
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:36:52
Several mil...
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:09:43
Paint with a wide brush much?
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:26:18
I get that idea of bitcoin is freedom but how is it freedom? How has your life become more free since using it?
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:48:30
Fucking cringe, dude. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:45:37
It will not.
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:06:16
From Amazon?
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:11:09
Are you paying taxes on the income generated from the sale? Separate from the BTC question. You still owe the feds taxes for the money you received as income, regardless of the currency.
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:34:59
Many millions agree that OP is right: 
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:53:38
No. You’re using an Amazon gift card to buy things off of Amazon. Not the same thing as using bitcoin directly. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:21:38
It’s because you’re full of shit. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:08:47
Yes, but you have to first convert your bitcoin before it can be used. That’s because you really can’t use it on amazon for everything. Like the other poster said... you can convert it to fiat and use it the same. But ultimately, you’re not using bitcoin on amazon. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:40:47
But why is that freedom? How has your life changed?
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:19:08
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:31:30
You cannot imagine a scenario where cryptos fail?
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:36:07
I think they were just pointing out that what you are saying is not the same as using bitcoin on Amazon. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:56:42
Internet drugs. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:16:01
Ah... that’s exactly how it works. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:46:56
I’d love to be able to tell you. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:19:44
What the fuck does this have to do with fiat?
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:30:51
Thanks for clarifying... I had no idea which country was being referred to in the post above. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:23:27
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:33:13
Sounds more like btc is a little girl in his world. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:48:56
I would love to hear a legitimate answer to this by a true believer. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:35:03
Cringe. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:52:57
Morse code... okay then. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:10:28
It is quite unlike saying that. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:54:56
“The most valuable thing mankind has ever built”
No. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:22:41
Because the dark web is a great example of widespread adoption. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:41:14
So widespread
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:20:37
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:55:31
The housing issue is a market issue. New constructions are dropping but people are still buying houses. 
And the education thing, well... that’s a big problem, for sure. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:14:31
I would think... you know, the internet would supersede that. Considering bitcoin does not function without it
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:32:28
So, you’re a pedophile?
