There exist software, web and custodial wallets. They do store private keys. And yes you can set a password on your wallet and the software will encrypt the wallet file although it's proper encryption not the toy kind found in zip.

They will flood the market with even more fiat some of which will flow to bitcoin pushing the price up. Whenever they debase their currency asset prices go up. That's why you have record prices for bitcoin, real estate, stocks and even bonds. There's so much fiat in the system that bond investors are willing to stomach negative interest rates on $13 trillion worth of bonds i.e. they are paying governments for a safe store of value.

longs can get liquidated as well. i think that big bull run from 3k-8k led to more longs being liquidated than shorts. the problem is not whether you are short or long it's how much leverage you use. if you use too much leverage you can't bear short spikes or dips in price.

When you make a payment out to someone in bitcoin you are essentially creating a small computer program, called an output script, that explains the conditions under which the bitcoins can be spent by the recipient. An address is a template for common output scripts. The reason you have these profusion of addresses is because over time we've come up with more efficient output scripts. 
Bottom line choose the p2pkh (address beginning with 1) one for maximum compatibility or the p2wpkh-p2sh one (address beginning with 3) if you want to save transaction fees but at the cost of possibly facing some inconvenience in the future when you try to spend these coins.
BTW that site coinglacier is not loading for me. It's a relatively new paper wallet generator so I would be cautious. Why not use an established software wallet like [electrum]( instead?

it does discourage people to spend bitcoin but some still do. you can tell they do by looking at the blockchain. money is still moving around :P
actually the main problem with it being used as a currency is the volatility. but i guess that's another side of the  decentralized nature of it. no central bank to dampen volatility. the volatility also encourages speculation which gets us the headlines that drive user adoption. 


most of us are in it for the money. financial freedom is being in it for the money too because fiat continues to be devalued so bitcoin gives you freedom from that.

The 4 weeks isn't the time till it's finished it's how much of the blockchain is left i.e. 4 weeks worth of transactions. 
It gets slower as it goes along because validation takes longer. Early blocks were easier/faster to validate. This means that validating latter blocks is also affected by CPU speed and not just network speed.
This is why we need lightning. Running a full node is quite resource intensive. Bigger blocks were never going to help.

The private key is the hash of the image. It's stored unencrypted on your phone. Also the author expects people to send the image to anyone they want to receive money from.

The Chinese worked very hard to build up their forex reserves. They are not going to let that money leak out via bitcoin or any other vehicle. It would lead to a balance of payments crisis.

All private keys are public in the sense that they are 256 bit numbers. However, there is no way to calculate all those numbers and there is no database on earth that can hold that much data. That site simply calculates 256bit numbers based on the page number as an offset. As in, you can calculate from the middle of the range of all 256 bit numbers but not all numbers 1 through &lt;god knows how many quadrillions&gt;.
The security of bitcoin rests in the fact that 256 bits is such a large number that you couldn't find private keys with bitcoins in them even if you spent many lifetimes looking for them. For more info google bitcoin quantum sun pic.

"Why would I ever want to walk into a shop or restaurant and pay for stuff with it?"
Here are some reasons:
You might buy bitcoins because they are deflationary and appreciate in value. Once you have them you might decide to spend some of them directly.
Because merchants benefit from bitcoin transactions and offer you discounts. It costs them less to process these transactions and they face no risk of chargebacks.
I suppose time will tell whether the above two reasons are sufficient for you to make the switch.

No, it's blocks of 100 so that you can backup it up and that backup is good for *up to* 100 transactions going forward. What does that mean? It means a new wallet will have 100 unused keys. You do 5 transactions and maybe 5 addresses have been used up and now you have 95 unused keys. You do 95 transactions and now you've used up all your keys. On your very next transaction or when you next ask for a new address it will generate 100 keys to fill the pool again. If your wallet is encrypted it will ask for the password so that it can write the news keys to the wallet file.
FYI 100 is the default size of the key pool, but you can change it to an arbitrary number if you create a config file. See the bitcoin wiki @ en.bitcoin.it for more details. 
Edit: turns out I'm wrong. See discussion below.
@_date: 2014-06-10 13:10:06
It generates an extra x number of forward key pairs that have not had any transactions. This x number is called the gap limit and is 5 by default. So as soon as you have coins hitting an address it makes sure that you have 5 unused addresses and if need be generates more until you have that. If you have 5 consecutive addresses that have had no transactions then you will have an inaccurate balance. At that point you can increase the gap limit manually using the console tab:
    wallet.storage.put( 'gap_limit', 20 )
Then restart electrum.

There is no standard but it can be done. You could put a txt record that contains your address, stealth address, or master public key. For it to be integrated with bitcoin clients though will require a standard. i.e. a BIP so that all client developers are on the same page.

The password is used to encrypt the wallet so isn't it the same thing? You lock your wallet (encrypt) by setting a password. You unlock (decrypt) it briefly to spend bitcoins. 


So you are saying that 9/10 times you request a new address it is because you are spending bitcoins and you need a change address. So because you are spending, the wallet is unlocked to sign the transaction and the software tops up the key pool right away. 
The other 1/10 times is when you request a new receive address and the wallet is locked so the software doesn't add to the key pool right away.
Have I got it right now?

You can't use it without the internet. A momentary localized disruption is not going to be a problem for those outside the affected area. Even a temporary worldwide disruption could be dealt with. But no internet at all forever? People would have to start developing bitcoin to work over some other fast communication medium. The the question arises if you have this other fast medium, say radio waves or submarine cables, then why not connect computers using it and create an "Internet"?

These are the sort of things you should have talked about instead of the role of governments and other political horse shit.

"People who haven't worked on password cracking have this quaint notion of running a little dictionary file through a program... and this would have been accurate in 1990 for someone cracking at your unix-crypt uni shell account.  Today the tools are significantly better and have been refined through the disclosure of hundreds of millions of unencrypted passwords and the same kind of statistical tools that power speech recognition and automatic human language transaction. This statistical intelligence gets backed up by the brute force of GPU and FPGA clusters that can try hundreds of million or even billions of attempts per second."

The USD has value because you need it to buy oil. Except for oil producing nations every nation on earth needs to buy oil to power its transportation and industry. So it's a constant struggle to get enough dollars to pay for oil imports. This is why global trade in other things is also done in dollars.
BTC needs something like that. It doesn't have to start out as an exclusive arrangement i.e. "we will only take BTC". But if it is a cheaper arrangement like we will offer you a 10% discount if you pay via BTC that encourages people to buy and hold BTC. Gradually the other payment options are edged out because they are more expensive and bitcoin is all that remains.

I think it is safe to say that you can't prevent theft from online wallets. So far everyone who has tried has failed. The only solution, IMO, is to insure bitcoin funds. I read an article about a bitcoin cold storage business that is insured by Lloyds of London. Exchanges now need to try and convince these insurance companies to offer the same facility to them so that they can pass it on to their customers. It's going to be a tough sell and will almost certainly result in higher fees for traders.

Most USD are in circulation outside the US. Crude oil producers underwrite the USD. Oil is the main fuel that powers our world. Oil producers sell their oil for your paper money. They will not accept any other currency (if they did they would be promptly bombed and invaded). This means that oil is relatively cheap for Americans. 
Countries around the world maintain their forex reserves in *the* reserve currency which is the USD. They do this to pay for their imports and the main one is oil. Those forex reserves are invested in US treasuries which allows you to keep up your lavish lifestyles. 
You can debase your currency via QE. In doing so you are basically taxing *the world* via inflation.

Well you are right in that the price will go down in the short to medium term because of this. But in the long run it is bullish. Consider how fiat get its value. The theory goes that it is because the government demands payment of taxes in fiat. So the greater the acceptance by organizations the more value a currency has. Of course you still need to give consumers a compelling reason to use bitcoin. Perhaps as you have more and more merchant adoption you may see discounts being offered. Perhaps companies like circle will make it easier to buy bitcoins.

Read the rest of that thread. He's criticizing brain wallets i.e. wallets that are *only* protected by a human generated passphrase/password. A bc.i wallet is in effect a brain wallet because it is so easy to get at the encrypted copy of your wallet leaving your password as the sole obstacle to stealing your coins.
A desktop wallet is much harder to steal from because a) you have to first get at the wallet file b) crack the password. You have two lines of defense in this case. 
Bottom line is passwords are a legitimate tool but you should not rely on them alone.

You can buy and sell doge coin for bitcoin at an exchange like cryptsy. To exchange the bitcoins for your country's currency you will need to find a buyer in your country. Perhaps localbitcoins is a place where you can look? 
Another option would be to sell at an international exchange like bitstamp or btc-e. Then you could sell the bitcoins and receive money via SWIFT wire transfer. You will of course to go through a lot of trouble to do all this. Exchanges other than BTC-E need verification meaning kyc/aml. You will also need to look into transaction costs like bank fees and whether banks in your country allow you to receive money from foreign companies.
So start researching all of this. Understand that for amounts less than $300 it may not be worth the effort and cost involved.

Exactly. The OP is missing a lot of details. South Asian economies are cash based. Poor people have no need for bank accounts.
I will add however that some parts of the middle east are looking at forcing employers to pay their workers via the banking system. This is being done to cut down on employee abuse. The football world cup preparations in Qatar have drawn attention to that issue in the western press and that is putting govts under pressure. So in future employees might have to open bank accounts.

That makes no sense. The government does not create a competitive advantage for a country. It is something inherent in that country. Maldives is beautiful so people go there for vacations.

@_date: 2014-08-28 16:08:14
Bitcoin is actually very inflationary at the moment. Around 10% a year inflationary. That is why the price is falling. Bitcoin needs adoption to grow at greater than 10% a year just for it to maintain its price. Adoption by consumers is not growing enough. OTOH merchant adoption is growing much faster and that is enticing early adopters to spend some of their hoard. The fact that some of these merchants are giving very nice discounts also has an impact. If you are looking for a reason to spend then there are quite a few.

You can use a larger seed if you want. You just need to generate it yourself. For example using openssl:

Then use the restore function to create a wallet with the above seed.
The caveat is that paper backups of your &gt;128bit seed wallet will not work going forward when electrum 2.0 is released (you can still use them with &lt;2.0). Soft copy backups will work because they contain an additional field seed_version.

LN is a way to offload transactions off-chain in a trustless manner. The pros are cheaper and faster transactions. The cons are it's more complicated and less secure than on-chain transactions.
bip32 is standardization of deterministic keys. The idea with deterministic keys is that you have one secret, called the seed, per wallet and all address-specific private keys are derived from that one secret. This makes backups easier since you only need to backup that one secret and it's good for the life of the wallet. Most people who lose bitcoin lose it because they don't have sufficient backups not because they got hacked. The downside is that if your seed is compromised your whole wallet will be compromised. 
Segwit does two things. It separates the signatures from the other parts of a transaction. This  provides two main benefits. Transaction ID (txid) malleability is solved and you can create larger blocks without doing a hard fork. Tx id malleability made LN harder to implement so it had to be solved. Tx id malleability was also a contributing factor for the mt. gox thefts btw. Larger blocks allow you to increase the amount of transactions that can be added to the blockchain in the same amount of time. Not requiring a hard fork also made it easier to get consensus. The downside to segwit is that it's more complex than a hard fork based fix would be.
@_date: 2019-03-19 12:33:26
private keys never leave your wallet. even a signed one wouldn't have the private key in it. 
do as ghost says and update. 
for future reference once electrum has synced you can broadcast transactions with electrum itself. tools &gt; load transaction &gt; load from file and then click broadcast.
@_date: 2019-03-18 15:57:22
Yes right click and remove it. A local transaction is just one that you saved in the wallet file and never broadcast. Next time use the export button in the preview window not the save button.
If the tx has confirmed and is not showing up in your history tab then tell me what it says in the bottom left of the electrum window and what color orb is there in the bottom right?
Also an unsigned transaction does not include the private key. If electrum had the private key it would just sign the transaction with it.
What 'different app' did you use to sign the tx?

addresses are not the same as a wallet. your wallet has many addresses. looking at the blockchain will be misleading. you give out a different address to every person you want to receive money from so as to track who sent you how much.

@_date: 2019-03-30 19:01:02
depends on the fee and how long since a block was mined. blocks are mined on average every 10 minutes calculated over a 2 week period. however over shorter periods it can vary widely. sometimes its seconds between blocks and sometimes hours. 
if your wallet lets you bump the fee with rbf or cpfp then try that. or just wait.

Given enough time and advances in computing it'll be possible to crack those old private keys based on public data alone. In cases where we have access to the old wallet files it'll be even easier. So there'll be some natural recovery of old coins.

4 &amp; 5 are nothing more than voodoo. Addresses have checksums in them to prevent typos. Those are automatically checked by your wallet. You don't have to send money to an address to make sure it is valid.

The first time you spend money sent to an address that address' public key is revealed. This lowers the security a little. It's not as big a deal as you make it out to be. Quantum computers that can break ecdsa are still decades away. The privacy loss + the inability to track who sent you how much are the bigger problems with address reuse. You want to give different people different addresses so that you can identify the source of the funds based on which address the coins were sent to.

The confusion stems from the fact that miners no longer mine alone. Back in the day miners were mining solo but that ceased to be practical long ago because of the reason you mentioned i.e. the income stream wasn't very regular or predictable. So they now mine in mining pools and the pool operator makes sure to distribute the rewards according to the contribution each miner made. So now it's a competition between mining pools and whatever pool solved a block first gets the reward and all the transaction fees in that block.

I suggest you write down everything you remember about the brainwallet NOW. You can try hypnosis or Dave at your leisure but your chances will be better if you note down everything while you still remember it.
Also that 20% fee is not set in stone. I think if you contacted Dave and told him how much money is at stake he will be willing to compromise on his fee. Negotiate hard! After all 20% of 1800btc is a lot more than 20% of 10btc or whatever the typical wallet is.
Another alternative is to simply wait for the ecosystem to develop more. Dave is currently the only reputable one who does this but in future there will be more competition in this area and that should drive fees lower.

we are segwit version 0 not 3. you are thinking of segwit p2sh addresses which electrum does not use.
you don't have to do anything. your seed will continue to work. most likely you won't have to restore from seed. electrum will pick up your wallet file and upgrade it automatically.
to create segwit addresses you have to go out of your way to create a new wallet with a new seed. it doesn't impact your existing wallet.

@_date: 2019-03-13 09:01:49
Some reasons why that may happen:
- It could lead to centralization. When everyone is connected to a few well connected nodes those nodes have disproportionate influence in the network.
- It'll increase the velocity of bitcoin which will put downward pressure on the price. 
- Transacting on lightning is a lot cheaper than transacting on-chain so demand for on-chain transactions will go down and with it transaction fees. This'll hurt miners especially since the block reward is also going down. So it might impact the security of the blockchain.

The UTXO set has to be kept in memory by full nodes.

The server you are connected to is only used to get transaction data relevant to your addresses and to broadcast spending transactions. It doesn't see your wallet file, your private keys or your seed. It only sees your addresses. When you open electrum you are not logging into a remote server. 
The wallet file is constantly written to during normal use. Electrum caches transactions relevant to your wallet, labels you might set and the keys of derived addresses.

the standalone and installer versions both create the wallet files in a separate location:
the only difference between those two versions is that one has to be installed and other just works.
the portable one will create the wallet file a subdirectory relative to its current directory. so it is most suited for use on usb drives. otherwise if you used one of the other versions your wallet file would be created on the c:\ drive.
note using the portable version on a public computer is not advisable. you are still vulnerable to malware on that computer. if you need portability and security use tails OS live USB with a persistent partition instead.

LOL the US has inflation too.  The dollar has lost what 90% of its value since the end of the gold standard? 
The reserve currency status actually encourages the US to devalue its currency. Reserve status means it is constantly running huge trade deficits and has to borrow to finance them. It has huge debts and devaluing the currency means they have to pay back less. It's debt monetization.


Taking undue risk is bad. When you're getting free money you will start taking undue risk. That's what happened with the financial system in the US in the wake of Greenspan's rate cuts and the deregulation of the economy prior to 2008. It's been happening since QE started. We see it in the tech sector too. Why would it not happen with individuals? Browsing I see that Americans mostly live on credit. It's only going to get worse when they start getting handouts from their govt.
It's not just financial risks. There's also risky lifestyles. Taking risks with your health for example.

litecoin is just bitcoin except worse. faster blocks and scrypt are a security risk. then there's the larger coin limit which makes it less valuable.

The JS code they use silently falls back to insecure random number generators when it can't find a secure one. These pages also encourage address reuse. Handling priv keys manually is also a bad idea.

not unless you are trying to do this manually. if you're using a hardware wallet + associated software or a software wallet then the wallet takes care of safely handling change for you.
another possibility is that you expose your seed to a malware infected system and it steals all your money. so don't do that.

Ask your wallet provider for the answer to that. High priority/low priority etc. are terms specific to your wallet not bitcoin terms. So we don't know what they mean by that.

that's not what address reuse means. it means receiving money, spending it and receiving more to the same address. alternatively receiving payments from different parties to the same address.

Governments do lots of silly things and don't take advantage of obvious opportunities staring them in the face. 
For example my country Pakistan decided it didn't like bitcoin but couldn't bring itself to ban it properly. So they pseudo-banned it hoping it would go away.  This was back when bitcoin was priced in hundreds of dollars. 
When it didn't go away they sort of pseudo-allowed it on the condition that bitcoin traders register themselves with the regulator responsible for dealing with securities. No one has done that to date although trading continues as per normal on localbitcoins.
No doubt tomorrow they'll take additional measures that will have absolutely no effect on bitcoiners!
In the meantime the price has gone up 10x. The country could have profited greatly if they had bought some when it was cheaper. But they didn't so we are back to the IMF!

you thought wrong. this has been a thing for a long time:
my advice to users is to write down the wallet software/hardware you used along with the seed mnemonic. bonus points if you also write down the date and/or software version. don't count on being able to restore your wallet using any other software/hardware wallet. always use the same software/hardware wallet. in most cases you will use the latest version even if the seed was generated in an older version.

check your email archives for emails from blockchain.info. perhaps you backed up your wallet with them and they sent it to you via email. their backups used to have the extension .aes.json
as it is you have base64 encoded data. it could also be encrypted. since you have no clue what wallet the file is for or even what the decryption password is you're probably screwed. 
however, i agree with the others that passing it through a base64 decoder (`uudecode` on *nix) would be a good first step. if the data is encrypted or is a wallet file then the output of the decoder will be meaningless to you. if it's simply your private keys in plain text then you can easily recognize them:

Without access to the internet you can't verify transactions and so you can't accept bitcoin. This is the answer currently and for the foreseeable future. No doubt you will have people talking about mesh networks and other jerry rigged networks but those don't exist and there is no interest in setting up such things. Even the blockstream satellite has limited bandwidth and can't be used for initial block download. You can only keep up with new blocks using that.

You should watch Narcos mexico. In that they explain that the real eureka moment in the drug war was that they should trace the movement of the money and not the drugs. 
Essentially when the shit hits the fan people look for someone to blame. If money is centralized then blame can be attributed easily. If money is not centralized then you have to use centralized hubs/exchanges to attribute blame.
For the US it's also a political matter. Their biggest asset is the dollar and the control it gives them over the financial system. They can impoverish entire countries by excluding them from the financial system.

bitcoin is volatile and hard to use so it doesn't make sense as an everyday payment mechanism. this may change in the future but right now it's just not good enough at this job. it's good for speculation and as a store of value. it's good for irreversible international payments. it's used for things it's good for now.

The backup is what you restore from. That's why it's called a backup.
If what you mean is that you can make multiple backups on multiple microsd cards then that is true indeed. You could store the microsd cards in different locations too.
Regarding  “wear-leveling &amp; block mgmt” it means it uses a smarter controller for the flash memory. This minimizes the risk of data corruption. Mind you this isn't likely going to be a problem for something like a microsd card where you save something once and then only occasionally read it.

there are many differences between wallets. electrum for example doesn't generate bip39 seeds although it'll let you restore from bip39. however it only supports one address type per restored wallet while mycelium combines p2pkh, p2wpkh and p2wpkh-p2sh in one wallet. other differences relate to the derivation path you use. 
bottom line is that it is not guaranteed that an average bitcoin users will be able to simply restore from seed in a different wallet software. he/she will have to research things beforehand. so best not to sell them on this. tell them the truth that they can only use the same software for a hassle free restore from seed.

It's a little old but it should dispel any notions you have of 100% compatibility between HD wallets.

Where did you store your seed backup? The seed is the 12/24 words it makes you write during the wallet setup. Someone may have gotten to that and used it to steal from you. They don't need access to your hardware wallet if they have the seed. They can use any number of software wallets.

Bitcoin is useful for certain things right now and not so useful for others. You can buy illegal things with it, launder money with it, evade capital controls and taxes. You can invest fiat into it and watch it multiply because bitcoin is deflationary in nature while fiat is inflationary. It is volatile so short term speculation is also possible with it. So it is most useful for these things at the moment. 
also it's not a get rich quick scheme. it's a get rich quicker scheme. it still takes years of hodling to make you rich. you bear risk doing this so it's not some magic potion.


money has many different uses not just buying lunch. i suggest you read up on the properties of money.

Yes the addresses get linked together when you spend your coins. It's still better to use different addresses because:
a) the addresses aren't linked until you spend your coins so there's a temporary benefit 
b) you can choose to selectively spend your coins manually so as to avoid creating links between addresses. this is called coin control. 
c) reusing addresses has a slight impact on the security of your coins. the address specific public key gets exposed when you spend coins sent to an address. right now it is not possible to derive the private key from the public key but that may change in the distant future with the advent of quantum computers that are fast enough.
d) it makes it easy to track who sent you how much if you hand out a different address to every party or for every transaction.

There are a few problems with this article:
- one of the asset bubbles created by QE is the bitcoin bubble. we can't ignore that. if other asset bubbles burst the bitcoin price will also fall.
- demand for US treasuries is so high that it's pushing yields down. the flattening of the yield curve we've been reading about is because of high demand for longer duration treasuries. so it's not correct to say there is no demand for them.
- there doesn't seem to be a limit to how much money they can pump into the economy. japan has been doing it for 2 decades with no inflation in sight. their public debt is at 200% of GDP now.

the way you build up confidence in something new is by  gradually taking small steps. so i suggest you start by installing a software wallet like [electrum]( on your PC and withdrawing some of your coins to it. then try sending those back to coinbase. in this manner you'll learn how to setup a wallet (making sure to write down the seed), what addresses are and how to use them. then you can try with larger amounts or a hardware wallet if that's the direction you want to go.

This particular increase appears to be a classic short squeeze. Shorts are people who borrow bitcoin to profit from a fall in the price. They sell their borrowed coins and hope to buy back in at a lower price. A short squeeze is when the price is pushed up by some traders in order to force shorts to buy back in creating further buying pressure which pushes up the price even more and triggers further buying by other short traders.
So the reason for the sudden price rise is that you had many overleveraged short traders that suddenly found themselves out of money and their positions were force closed (liquidated) by the exchange. Since they are short a liquidation creates demand for bitcoin which pushes up the price and sets off a cascade of further liquidations and resulting price rises.
It remains to be seen whether this price will hold in the future once most overleveraged shorts have been closed.

you can do that but it probably won't matter security wise. the sequence is actually a part of a whole derivation path. sort of like a filesystem path. you could start with an arbitrary path if you like. see bip32: 
if you want to try it for real electrum lets you set the derivation path when you restore from a seed and specify bip39 as the seed mnemonic type. see the guide here:
the note in the step 4 shows you how to choose bip39

running a node isn't hard. you just download bitcoin core and run it. it'll automatically create a wallet for you and start downloading and verifying the blockchain. though you may want to enable pruning under options  if you lack disk space (settings &gt; options &gt; main tab). 
once it's done syncing the chain you grab an address from the receive tab and send your money over.
the main thing with having your coins on an online system is that you practice safe computing habits. don't download and install random software. be careful what attachments you open and what links you click. if you can't do all that then it's probably not a good idea to keep your coins on a software wallet.

- bitcoin is more high profile now. people aren't going to let it sit at a discount compared to ath for long. the more mature a market the more forward looking it becomes. for example the US stock market trades at PE ratios of 30-40
- libra is basically free marketing for the entire space. it legitimises it. it's odd because it's supposed to be a competing product.

It doesn't do that at all. It's just a fantasy of first worlders.
I remember back in late 2012 or early 2013 I read about bitcoin for the first time because wp.com decided to start accepting it as a payment method. They claimed it was to facilitate users in developing countries who didn't necessarily have access to credit cards. I found myself laughing at that because bitcoin was even more obscure. 
There are however areas where bitcoin does help. For example a lot of hosting companies believe that third worlder CCs are fraudulent and demand IDs and stuff. Bitcoin is sound money so if you pay with bitcoin you can enjoy a more smoother buying experience. You don't have to share IDs. This doesn't benefit the unbanked though.
The other main benefit is that it helps you make money! Third world countries tend to have underdeveloped financial systems. There are few options for investment. Bitcoin is accessible around the world so it's a great option. 
So overall bitcoin in third world countries bitcoin is useful for the upper middle class and upper class people. It's not for the poor unbanked.

They won't do it because it undercuts their banks and they like their banks. Governments and banks have a symbiotic relationship. I suggest you [read about digicash]( and why it failed to take off. This was a 90s attempt at a centralized crypto which means it needed the cooperation of banks and governments. That's a bit like asking them to shoot themselves in the foot. 
This is why bitcoin had to take the form it did i.e. it had to be decentralized. You can't expect the entrenched interests to adopt a technology that will render their lucrative services obsolete. 
However, you can't stop the adoption of new technology only delay it. They managed to delay it for decades but now it's too late. All this talk of government approved digital currencies is just a desperate attempt to fool people. They realize now that if they don't offer *the hope* of an alternative it's all going to get out of control. But they'll never actually offer such a currency because they can't.

Electrum decided to switch the default wallet type to p2wpkh back in december 2018 (version 3.3.0). However, it takes time for users to upgrade to newer versions so it's only in recent months that we've noticed complaints about these addresses. Seems at least some of these complaints were directed at the exchanges! Noticing the increasing support burden they decided to add support for bech32 addresses. No doubt it's cheaper than answering all those tickets!

Those who bought bitcoin earlier took a greater risk so they enjoy a greater reward.


Deflationary currencies have been used as a medium of exchange for many millenia. For example gold coins.
As for bitcoin it's not really a great currency for day to day use. Right now it's more of a speculators' currency. So there's little chance that it'll be a) widely adopted and b) hurt the economy through deflation.

You can use this to get to your wallet: 
But you'll need to know the password for it. In fact if you know the password then you can simply login:  . The wallet ID should be in the emails from blockchain.
There also used to be something called the password recovery phrase which consisted for 18 English words. If you have that then let me know and I'll guide you further. Note this is not the wallet seed like you have with newer versions of blockchain.com wallet. Wallet seed is 12 words.

Not as a mnemonic but you could give them your master public key which is also known as an xpub. They can then derive address using that.
You definitely should not be sharing seed phrases with anyone. Those have to remain private since anyone that has them can spend your coins.
As for sub-master public keys you could have different HD accounts in the same wallet if your wallet software supports that feature. Mycelium does for example. Each HD account has a different xpub.
If you're using electrum then you can simply restore from seed making sure to enter a different seed extension (something simple like '1','2' will do). This will create an entirely different wallet with a different xpub. Here's [a guide]( for restoring from seed. To enter a seed extension click on options on step 4 and check the appropriate option. You will get a chance to enter the seed extension in subsequent steps.

The thing with bitcoin is that you can never tell for sure who stole your coins. They can do it independently without your knowledge or permission. They can do it remotely.

QCs have the potential to derive the private key from the public key and steal people's bitcoins. [Almost 10%]( of bitcoins sit in pay to public key outputs. Address reuse is [also rampant]( Reused addresses means the public key has been exposed on the blockchain. So we will have to move to a new form of cryptography before QCs become fast enough. 
The problem is that QC safe algorithms have insane key sizes or create large signatures. This won't do for bitcoin because all this data has to be stored on the blockchain. That's why they haven't made the move yet.
@_date: 2019-08-30 02:57:21
I suggest you take a look at the graph starting with late june. It basically peaked around then and that was also the time the plus token scammers got arrested.

addresses are derived in sequence not randomly. so they are handed out in sequence as well. this means a user can't be using address 5000 when the original wallet has only derived addresses 0-500. 
when restoring from seed you derive addresses in sequence again starting from 0 and search for relevant transactions. when you find x number of contiguous addresses without transactions you conclude that you've derived all used addresses and stop. that x is the read ahead window or gap limit.

the signatures are simply moved to another part of the same block. this made it possible to add more transactions into the same block without violating the rules older bitcoin clients were used to. that was important because it mades it possible to upgrade to larger blocks without breaking things for older bitcoin clients.
another benefit for segwit was that it made transaction IDs more reliable. previously transaction IDs could change if you miners or other network participants made changes to parts of transactions. this created problems for systems that relied on the transaction ID of unconfirmed transactions for tracking purposes.

Most wallets are [bip44]( Examples are mycelium, blockchain.info and all hardware wallets. It's a standard for derivation paths for p2pkh addresses (1 addresses). You can learn more about derivation paths from [bip32]( That bip also explains accounts and, yes, they are like having multiple wallets derived from the same seed.
If a child private key plus account level xpub of a bip44 wallet is leaked only that account is affected. Other accounts derived from the same xprv are not effected because there's hardening at the account level (shown as a singlequote in bip44). Hardened derivation limits the damage caused by attacks like these.

bip38 is a standard for private key encryption. so first you generate a random private key and then you encrypt it. encryption means scrambling it with a password. the scrambled state is called ciphertext. if you know the password you can decrypt it back to plain text state i.e. it's unencrypted form i.e. the raw private key. so that's how it all works.

Well SSL is there. SSL is to prevent MITM attacks. On top of that there's a signature in the file to authenticate the data. It can be verified with the public key of a hardcoded address in the electrum client. The private key is known only to the developers. You should read up on how they are currently doing it. It's a new feature introduced in 3.3.3. 


It does mean that you rely on the electrumx server to return this data to you and a malicious server might simply choose to return an empty set. This way you never learn about updated versions. So it does defeat the purpose of the whole thing.

Another side of this is that if you want investors in your bitcoin hodling business it's easier if you sell them the story of bitcoin mining riches rather than simply tell them that you are buying bitcoin and sitting on it. hut8mining literally said as much in the notes to their [financial statement](


Overall they were running at a loss but were hopeful of making it up once bitcoin started to increase in price.
Now this might sound scammish but if the investors are aware of what's going on then it's not. In some cases investors prefer to hodl via such front businesses. For example Balaji Srinivasan's earn.com may be just such an entity. It's easier because of regulations to do it like this.

Buying BTC with fiat is also hard. Now you're on the other side  of the deal and have to convince the seller your reversible payment method is trustworthy. All bank based methods are reversible. 
Money that is in btc is usually earned illegally or its tax evaded. Once you evade taxes you can't really go back. You'll have to whiten it somehow.

short squeeze. people sold borrowed bitcoin with a view to buying back in at a lower price and profiting from the price difference. it was a bet that the price would fall. when the price started rising instead they had to close their positions\* by buying bitcoin and that led to increased demand for bitcoin which caused the price to rise even further putting pressure on other short traders to close their positions and so on. basically a chain reaction caused by many short positions closing at the same time.

70% of tether is backed by real dollars. That's what came out in the NYAG action. The NYAG took exception for the fact that not all of it was backed by real dollars because tether lost some to confiscations in Europe. Tether is backed by real dollars from drug cartels. The drug business is bigger than legit businesses in some respects. That's why the US went to war with narcos - they were threatening to grow larger than legit businesses in the US and legit businesses complained to the govt. about it.

Two things come to mind:
- bitmain recently released a 7nm miner which is 28-30% more efficient than its older miners. This will mean mining becomes cheaper and that should increase selling pressure from miners. They will be willing to let go of their coins at lower prices.
- the halving is still more than a year away.

It uses the bip39 wordlist by default but encodes a version into the mnemonic. This helps it detect what type of wallet you have and eases the restoration process.
Another major difference is that the electrum doesn't enforce a wordlist on you. You can replace the default wordlist with a custom one and it'll be fine with that. You can restore from seed on any electrum installation even one without the custom wordlist.
So it's different. It's not compatible with other wallets that do support bip39. You can see the reasoning behind it here:

Also I think that traffic that comes from google search results is likely to make more ad revenue because the ads will be better targetted since google knows what the user is looking for.
Reddit traffic from this post won't make them much money even if they had adsense enabled (they've disabled it to spite google). The reason being that people here are more likely to have ad blockers.

I think the question to ask is whether it has any advantage over the method they are currently using which is where the client fetches a json file from the electrum website. The only advantage of the blockchain method is that the electrum.org web server doesn't learn your IP address. You could propose it on github if you like.
Just so we're clear the op_return will be in transactions spending money sent to this special address. The only way someone can spend from that address is if they control the corresponding private key and that's how you get the authentication. So the whole transaction will count and it'll be 226 bytes or so.

- It increases the cost of running a full node which leads to centralization.
- It doesn't really solve anything because a few years down the line we'll have to increase the max blocksize yet again which will worsen the situation.
- It doesn't explain how miners will get paid as the block subsidy goes down. The idea is that tx fees increase to compensate miners for the lower block reward. If miners don't get paid they won't mine, difficulty will go down and the network will become vulnerable to attack.
- Larger blocks lead to mining centralization. They take longer to propagate meaning miners that centralize in one geographical area have a competitive advantage.

a) if the choice is between a poor password and a good one that you write down then go ahead and write it down
b) if you forget your password then the IT dept. can just reset it for you. no one can help you if you loose access to your seed.
c) most people lose their coins because they forgot their password and not because they got hacked.
d) the seed on paper is a backup solution. having it on the same system as the actual wallet isn't good enough. (this is in the case of software wallets where some people screenshot their seed and store the soft copy)
e) the entire idea of an HW is that the private keys never touch another computer so you storing the seed of an HW online makes the HW redundant. 
having said that an encrypted cloud backup is not a bad idea if you're confident you can secure access to your cloud account and you won't forget the password :P. multibithd was designed with such backups in mind because of c. above. this does not apply to HW users because of e. above.

demand doesn't have to increase for the price to increase post halving. since supply is falling you will find a price increase even with demand staying constant.
however during a recession people tend to let go of riskier assets so demand will probably fall. we'll have to wait and see how bad the recession is though.
i'd also like to point out that the price of bitcoin has stayed unreasonably low in the past. the coins that used to be worth a few cents are the same ones that today sell for thousands today. the media and the legacy financial industry hates bitcoin so they keep churning out negative propaganda about it and that keeps buyers away. it is very effective but the flip side is that it provides an opportunity for those of us who are paying attention to profit in the long run.

- you didn't download from electrum.org but some other site. i suggest you verify the exact url by looking at your browser history. this bug has been fixed since 3.3.3 while the latest version is 3.3.6 so there's no way you would be seeing these messages with the latest version. 
- another possibility is that you're running the old version instead of the new one. i suggest uninstalling the old version or installing the latest one using the windows installer instead of using the portable version. when you install using the windows installer download it replaces the old one.

No that's not correct. The passphrase is used as salt in the hash function that converts the mnemonic to the binary seed. So it's not the same as changing the derivation path which is what that sounds like. 
Humans are not a good source of entropy which is why the seed is computer generated in the first place. Because the passphrase is human selected then at best it'll slow down a committed attacker that gets access to your seed. A major downside to using a passphrase is that if you ever forget it you lose your coins. So it doesn't add much to your security and in fact increases the chances of losses.

The limit varies according to the type of transactions included in a block. It can be 3MB plus if most of the transactions are segwit ones.


Yes lightning is the scaling solution they decided on. It promises to move the majority of transactions off chain.


poor people don't use bitcoin so any such justification was flawed from the beginning. the price is too volatile for poor people to bear the risk.
actually the main reason you want l2 solutions is because if the blockchain becomes too large the number of full nodes will go down and bitcoin will become centralized.

Yes they can crackdown on bitcoin if they want to. They cannot launch their own alternative though.
Note that if they put up regulatory hurdles for exchanges in the US then exchanges outside the US can expand faster. This has already happened in many cases. I believe coinbase ranks pretty low now on the list of top legit exchanges. If people are not using regulated exchanges then that transparency and control govt's seek is lost. That's why the German govt. has sought a single global policy to deal with cryptocurrencies so there is no safe haven for unregulated exchanges.

that's how it is with all centralized services in this space. you have to be very careful about keeping money with them and be proactive in researching how to verify yourself with them. they don't ask you all these questions when you're starting out because that makes it harder to onboard new customers and besides they don't know how many new signups are serious customers and how many are just "browsing". they will instead hold your money hostage after you've sent it to them and make you comply with their demands. that's how it's always been.
even in the fiat space this is how paypal does it. they limit (freeze) your account after you receive money to it.

1.2. It's based on demand and supply of bitcoins just like most things in a free market economy.
3. they can but they won't because having their own currency is profitable and gives them enormous control. that's why all governments are against bitcoin. it unites theocracies, communists, capitalists and secular governments like nothing else!
4. your own country's cryptocurrency would be a fiat currency. fiat does not mean paper money it means money by government decree. what would be required for it? it wouldn't be very expensive in terms of IT expenses. in fact it would be way cheaper than paper notes and the various layers of commercial banking and interest rates. but it does put commercial banks out of business and that's why they haven't done it yet. banks and governments have a symbiotic relationship. banks gather deposits at the retail level and lend them to governments. they serve as a channel to transmit central bank monetary policy. they spy on people's transactions for governments to use to collect taxes. so it's hard for govts. to break that habit of relying on banks.
5. bitcoin isn't designed for operation by governments or other centralized entities. it is designed to bypass them entirely. if a centralized digital currency is what you are looking for then you are in the wrong space.

the public key gets recorded in the blockchain when you spend your coins so a compressed public key saves you precious block space.
addresses, in their final form, never get recorded in the blockchain. instead a precursor i.e. the hash of public key is recorded. when you make a payment to someone you are paying to that hash of the public key. the actual public key is only revealed when the recipient spends his coins.
The hash of a public key is the same size regardless of whether it's compressed or not. However the hash will be different and so will the address but there's no space savings with the hash or the address. Hash functions by definition take an arbitrary sized input and output a number in a fixed range.
uncompressed public keys are obsolete so that's why newer standards mandate the use of compressed keys. you don't want to waste space if you can help it now do you?

It's not fool proof. If you're lucky it'll work. If not you'll be making posts in the community forums asking people to guess what wallet you used :). Better if you simply note it down alongside the seed so you don't forget.
@_date: 2019-12-21 20:36:29
It's just a standard for derivation paths. Basically you can take a single seed and derive a whole tree of key pairs and corresponding addresses. Where in the tree you are is defined by a derivation path. See the image in bip32:
[bips/bip-0032.mediawiki at master · bitcoin/bips](
There are some BIPs that try to define standard derivation paths for various uses. bip44 is the original one and then they extended it for p2wpkh addresses with bip84. Not all wallets support these. Electrum doesn't use bip44 for its native seed but does use bip84 for segwit wallets. Electrum does support bip44 when restoring from a bip39 seed mnemonic.

electrum is not suitable for this since it doesn't let you import arbitrary multisig keys. use bitcoin core which might work
multisigs are n of m. if you don't have all m private keys then you must have the public keys of the missing private keys i.e. to spend the coins you need all public keys.

Just goes to show that incentives matter in a decentralized system. Once upon a time there was no incentive for anyone to control which server you were connected to. Volunteers ran servers and the number of servers grew steadily from a dozen to nearly a hundred. All run for free by good hearted people in the community. 
But that all changed when the phishing bug was discovered. Suddenly servers could send you messages encouraging you to download their fake wallets which would steal your bitcoin. It's all escalated from there and now there's a war going on for control over electrum servers.

It means adding transactions to the chain requires spending a lot of money on hardware and electricity. Reversing an old transaction means you have to duplicate the work of the entire network for the block that contained the transaction + all subsequent blocks that came after it because blocks are cryptographically chained to previous blocks.

The wallet file is there so you don't have to restore from seed everytime you want to use electrum. It contains your seed, any derived private keys, data about transactions relevant to your wallet and labels and contacts you set in electrum. You can label your addresses for your own reference and you can add the addresses of other users in your contacts.
The password is used to encrypt the wallet file so that if someone or some program were to get access to your wallet file they wouldn't be able to spend your coins until they figure out your password. Depending on what option you selected the password may only be encrypting the wallet secrets i.e. the seed and derived private keys or the whole wallet. If it's the former you only get asked for the password when you attempt to spend your coins. If it's the latter you get asked at electrum startup. 
See [here]( regarding backing up your wallet.


If you wish to see the wallet balance and relevant transactions you need to go online. You don't need to be online to receive money.
In order to receive money you hand out an address from [the receive tab]( You don't hand out public keys. Public keys and addresses are different things. Please use the correct terminology.

Right now the p2p network mostly runs bitcoin core and core has 1sat/byte as default minimum fee. So that's why transactions paying less don't get relayed. If you can get a miner to mine the transaction then it's possible. Of course the miner will need to be compensated in some other way.

Well first the nature of hash functions is such that it irreversibly converts the inputs to the function to an output in a fixed range. So by it's nature you can't derive the input from the output. There are two (not one) hash functions being used to convert the public key to an address. There is no known way to derive the public key from the output of those two hash functions.
As for deriving the private key from the public key the computational power required to do so is more than all the computers in the world. So it is currently not possible. Perhaps in the future with faster quantum computers. 10-15 years down the road.

At the start it was a gradual up tick in price not sudden. It started a couple of months before the block reward halving. The price was around $200 and over those 2-3 months it went to $400.

We don't know for sure whether satoshi actually has a million bitcoin. It's all speculation.
The machines they use can't do anything but mine bitcoin. They are application specific.
Wallet addresses are hashes of the public key. If you want to reverse this process and derive the private key then you have to first break two hash functions sha256 and ripemd and then you have to break ecdsa to derive the private key from the public key. It is impossible to do all this.
If satoshi spent any coins sent to his addresses then his public key would have to be revealed and recorded on the blockchain. If he then reused those addresses to receive coins then breaking those addresses would be easier because you only have to break ecdsa. There are a lot of coins in reused addresses or pay to public key outputs so if someone breaks ecdsa, perhaps using quantum computers, he can make a lot of money. 
Overall the crypto that bitcoin uses is pretty hard which is why it has never been hacked in all the years it's been around. Exchanges and other custodians yes. Bitcoin itself never.

Difficulty rises and falls based on network hash rate so if mining is unprofitable less efficient miners will stop mining and it'll fall as is about to happen the next time it adjusts:

One would expect the majority to be compressed by now because they cost less in transaction fees but no way to tell for sure until the utxos are spent.
bc1 addresses are not invalid. In bitcoin core you can set the default format for change addresses to p2wpkh (bc1) . This way when you spend you automatically send change back to cheaper addresses. 
The only problem with bc1 addresses is that fewer sites and wallets support sending to these addresses so you will have problems receiving money to them. There is no problem sending money from p2wpkh outputs to anyone.

It does affect them. In fact it's starting to hurt their suppliers too:
The above is because of the decline in prices of alts but TSMC which makes chips for bitcoin ASICs is also affected. One can only imagine the situation at bitmain and other mining pools.
Mining is actually way more riskier than simply buying bitcoin. This is ironic because the popular wisdom is that if you mine at least you can sell the hardware should the coin price tank. Well the way I see it you are risking not only that mining will be profitable but also that the price will hold up. And with bitcoin ASICs there is no other use for them besides mining so if the price tanks the ASICs won't sell either.

I suppose you have to start by defining what you mean by ownership. Take real estate for example. What is ownership of real estate? Does it mean you can pack up your property and move it whenever you want to? Nope real estate is immovable so you can't move it. Does it mean that you decide who gets access to the property? Yes. Does it mean that you alone can sell the property? Yes. So ownership is defined as control over the property. It's the same with bitcoin. The secrets you hold let you control the coins. 
What's really mind blowing is that you don't really know whether you have control until you attempt to spend the coins.

yes wallets will account for transaction fees automatically if that's what you mean. they won't account for tips though. 
basically the amount you enter in the amount field on the send part of the wallet is what the recipient gets. in addition to that the transaction fees come from your wallet balance so the total cost to you is the amount you entered + transaction fees. transaction fees vary depending on the size of the transaction and the market conditions so it is best left to the wallet to determine those. transaction fees go to miners not the recipient.

Yes and no. Yes because they make backups easier and 9/10 times it's the users that are at fault for not properly backing up their wallets. No because if your seed is compromised all address specific private keys in that wallet will also be compromised. Overall it's worth the tradeoff to use an HD wallet (seed based).

addresses have checksums in them to prevent typos. no way for the sender to know whether the recipient controls the priv keys though. that's not a requirement for sending bitcoin.

It lets you create complex smart contracts without having to store the entire contract on the blockchain. You only store the particular branches that were actually used to unlock the coins.

It won't be one dollar though. One on-chain tx will be equivalent to tens of thousands of off-chain lightning txes. So people will be willing to pay hundreds of dollars for an on-chain tx. It's called [the jevon's paradox]( 
Also during  the 2017 spam attack fees exceeded the block reward for a few months. This despite there being no lightning. Imagine how much people will be willing to pay when 99% of transactions are over lightning?

You install electrum on your PC and create a 2factor authentication (just select that option when asked about the wallet type) wallet which requires an OTP code generated by google authenticator on your phone to spend from. This is more secure than a single sig wallet while being easier than a hardcore cold storage setup. 
Be sure to write down the seed words that are shown during the wallet creation process and put that piece of paper somewhere safe. If you ever lose your phone you'll need the seed words to restore your wallet. Note don't keep the seed on your PC or phone. Write it down on paper!

You'll need to dump the private keys in WIF. [This]( is what they look like. Then you can [sweep them into electrum]( on a desktop or laptop. It'll be harder to sweep into a mobile wallet because of the lack of proper input devices (scanning a dozen qr codes is a lot harder than copy pasting text on a PC).
Now regarding how to dump the private keys i suggest trying to figure this out yourself. There should be options to get the private keys of individual address or a backup option that dumps them all. Note you need the private keys not the root key. No other wallet supports the armory deterministic backup format but WIF is supported everywhere. If you can't figure it out then ask [here]( for specific steps.

someone only needs to know the seed words in order to steal your coins. they can do this at anytime and they don't need access to your trezor. so there are many possible suspects. for example maybe customs officers at the airport, perhaps someone you share your room with or someone with access to cctv footage who saw you take it out of your wallet.

fees aren't that high. it's more like 50-60c to move thousands or millions of dollars worth of coin.

HW cost around $100 I think so anything less than $2-3k doesn't justify spending on an HW.
IMO the trend towards "mandating" HW for all users is a bad one. It's putting up barriers to adoption. Where previously you could store coins for free now everyone tells you you have to spend on an HW.
Software wallets are very safe if you practice safe computing habits. IMO it's a better to spend time learning how to secure software wallets than to spend money on an HW. You will learn about bitcoin as well which will give you more confidence in the currency.

they pay you back in bitcoin so it should be 0.106 assuming a fixed interest rate for the entire period. if the interest rate is floating they may lower the interest rate over time if bitcoin rises. they lend your coins to short sellers and if shorting isn't profitable demand for your coins goes down so interest rate has to go down too.

For the most part yes although this is changing. Regulators are increasingly active in this area and regulated marketplaces are opening up. The unregulated markets have advantages over regulated ones though. It's much easier to get started trading on an unregulated exchange like bitmex than a regulated one like coinbase.
OTOH the regulated exchanges can attract institutional investors that unregulated ones can't. So there's that too.

Coinbase holds funds sent via some payment methods. IDK whether it does this for every deposit or just the first one by a new user. 
The problem is that fiat payment methods are all reversible while bitcoin transactions aren't. So these exchanges are taking a big risk taking money transfers and credit cards and so on. To minimize their risk they hold funds for some time. You have to gradually build a relationship with them.
If you don't have the patience for all of this then it's best you not get into bitcoin. This whole field has a lot of such issues that you have to learn to tolerate. Of course the upside is that we enjoy huge returns for our troubles.

This may change in the future with the advent of quantum computers. It's not a matter of finding the preimage of a hash. Bitcoin public keys become public once you spend from an address. You only have to crack ECDSA at that point. The first to fall will be the private keys of reused addresses.
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:44:01
According to pieter wuille hashing the public key doesn't protect you against quantum computers because many millions of coins sit in reused addresses:
A compromise of these outputs will destroy faith in the currency.
BTW further up the thread he implies electrum shares the xpub with electrum servers. This is not true. It only shares hashes of addresses.

If you're asking why mining is necessary then it serves the following functions in bitcoin:
- in the absence of a central bank it serves as a mechanism to distribute the coins among users
- the burning of power in the process of mining serves to secure the blockchain from modification. in the absence of any central controlling authority there has to be a decentralized mechanism to secure the ledger from modification. the cost that an attacker would face in order to change the ledger is that mechanism. 
- i also think it provides a way to imbue value into the coins. if the coins didn't require you to sacrifice something valuable for them they wouldn't be worth anything. you're essentially burning fiat to get bitcoin.
- mining riches serve as an incentive that fuels adoption of bitcoin.

Bitcoin can't stand up to nation state attacks so it's not a good choice. Besides governments are used to the control they have over their own currencies so they will never agree to adopt bitcoin. According to their mindset even adopting the currency of a rival nation is preferable to adopting bitcoin. If you want proof of this see how China has reacted to the rise of bitcoin. It needs an alternative to the dollar but doesn't like bitcoin.
Currently bitcoin is used as a reserve currency but not for international trade. It's used to payout security bounties to white hat hackers and ransoms to bad actors like malware authors. For this you need to have reserves of bitcoin on hand because buying large amounts of bitcoin is cumbersome and slow due to the various KYC related BS.

Bitcoin transactions are irreversible so once a transaction confirms you are no longer taking any risk. It is the buyer who is taking the risk. So just setup an [electrum wallet]( on your system and share an address from the receive tab with the buyer.

If you make a big enough stink about it the transactions can be reversed.

That video doesn't cover all the steps involved in mining. Verifying transactions for example. In order to verify transactions you have to convert public keys to addresses which my link shows is not possible to do manually. You have to verify signatures. You have to hash each and every transaction and create a hash tree. So it is you that is not technical enough.

The public key -&gt; private key thing maybe possible once we have quantum computers that are fast enough to do this. This might happen within 30-50 years. This would affect users with reused addresses. I don't know whether satoshi is among them or not.
People who haven't reused addresses are additionally protected by the hash functions used to convert the public key to an address. Their address specific public keys are not on the blockchain. IDK how long it'll take to compromise these funds.

A warning is reasonable but they can't really tell p2sh bitcoin and litecoin addresses apart so expecting them stop you is unreasonable!


Well first of all who does the address belong to? Does it belong to Coinbase? In that case to recover the coins would require manual intervention which they might decline as a matter of company policy. Regardless front line support won't know how to do this. You would have to ask them to escalate the ticket and then somebody more knowledgable might offer to do it in exchange for a percentage of the funds to pay for the manual intervention. 
If the address belongs to someone else then coinbase can't do anything about it. If they are claiming it can't be done then that's because either they don't know it can be done or they don't want the liability of it. 
Anyway incidents like these are increasingly common because of p2sh segwit addresses. The blame should be laid squarely on the litecoin devs and careless users not on exchanges. As you can see even the OP got the details wrong. Users are quick to blame others but don't care enough to pay attention to the details.

You can use bitcoin core. It's less risky to hold coins on your own device rather than trusting an exchange so that's what you're getting out of it.
@_date: 2019-05-27 10:45:46
No it isn't. It reduces your security somewhat and hurts your privacy. The privacy impact is that anyone who has your xpub can see all your transactions. The security risk is that if any one of your child private keys were to leak out then your entire wallet could be compromised. xpub + address specific private key makes it possible to derive the parent xpriv which in most cases exposes the entire wallet (If you're using multiple HD accounts in a single wallet this will expose the HD account in question not the other HD accounts)
@_date: 2018-12-26 09:55:28
First of all brain wallets [are insecure]( If you want a wallet that you can memorize create an electrum wallet and memorize the computer generated 12 word seed mnemonic.
Second, the two types of public keys you are seeing are the same except that they are encoded differently. Because the address is a fingerprint (hash) of the public key it also changes depending on which encoding you use. The compressed public key takes up less space on the blockchain and should be preferred (you will pay lower tx fees when spending). All software wallets use compressed keys as well.

why not just use 12 words with a passphrase? you can write the computer generated 12 words down and memorize the passphrase/seed extension. i don't think anyone is going to seize and notebook or paper you might be carrying with you. they won't care about that.
actually it's possible to memorize 12 words. the key is repeatedly typing it in i.e. repeatedly restoring a wallet with it. you do that a dozen or so times in one sitting to start with then come back a day later and repeat it and keep that up for a week. then next week do it every other day. every 3 days in the week after that. you'll have it down pat by the time you're done with this routine.

* You get an unlimited number of addresses with an HD wallet. No need to reuse addresses. This is better for your privacy and security.
* No risk of losing funds because you forgot to account for change. Change gets sent to another address derived from the same seed.
* Easier to write 12 English words than a base58 private key. If you use electrum you are not tied to any one dictionary either. 
* You can create a watch-only counterpart that lets you view transactions and balance and get receive addresses to receive money. The seeded wallet [can stay offline]( You can also do offline signing with this setup.

Yes, for the most part currencies don't have intrinsic value or the intrinsic value is so low that it doesn't matter. For example paper money has the value of the paper its printed on. You can make [nice bags out if it]( if the government backed value goes down the crapper. Gold has industrial uses but if that's all it was used for it wouldn't be worth much. If asteroid mining takes off we could seen a large influx of gold and platinum rendering them worthless as a store of value.
What this line of argument boils down to is that people don't see any uses for bitcoin. In that case you should inform them of its uses as hard to censor, irreversible and global money. They are coming around to it slowly. Even Buffet is calling it useful for gambling purposes. Although he doesn't mean it as a compliment it makes for an improvement over his previous statement of equating it with rat poison. Gradually they are beginning to see the potential.

You'll have unlimited addresses, writing it down is easy since it's just 12-24 English words and you can create a watch-only wallet on your PC that lets you view transactions and generate addresses but not spend the coins. With HD wallets you can also add a second factor to the seed words i.e. what is known as the bip39 passphrase or seed extension. With paper wallets this isn't possible and anyone who has the wallet can spend from it. You can't guarantee that no bank employee will ever see what you stored in the deposit box so a second factor is a good thing to have.

Electrum connects to electrum servers to get transaction data and broadcast transactions of its own. This means that you don't have to download the blockchain which is a big bonus. But it also means that the server you connect to knows your addresses so you loose out on some privacy. 
It also means that if a server were to be compromised it could feed you inaccurate data. For example it could tell you that you have received coins that you haven't or that don't even exist. Of course you can easily switch servers but if your in a hurry you might not think to do that.
Note the private key, which is the key behind spending your coins, is never shared with the server.

No it's not. It's not their job to figure this shit out for you. Neither are they allowed to explain it to you since then they would be held liable for it. Also you haven't told us who the target address belongs to? If it belongs to coinbase and it's their company policy not to help users in such situations then it's completely true to say that recovery is impossible. Recovery would require manual intervention and exchanges are well within their rights to refuse such a service.

You can't count on seed phrases being portable across wallets. If you're worried about your wallet software disappearing make sure you archive a copy of it alongside the seed. However note that bitcoin is still under heavy development and you can't count on blanking out for 10 years and expect to be able to dive right in again without first getting back up to speed.
A 12 word seed is a representation of a 128bits so the number of possibilities is 2^128. The chances of generating a duplicate seed are miniscule. So miniscule that you can rely on that never happening. All cryptography relies on the security of such large numbers. 
There is no central registry of seeds. Anyone who knows your seed can spend your bitcoins so there cannot be a central registry. It's all based on the security of large random numbers.

A sudden fall would indeed be very bad because difficulty only adjusts once ever 2016 blocks. A sudden fall would lead to many miners switching off and that will mean that new blocks will be produce very slowly. This will make the currency unusable until difficulty adjusts.

So what you're really asking is how do you tell whether you have the private keys corresponding to your address? You could restore your nano s wallet from seed using electrum and then take a look at your private keys there. But that would defeat the purpose of using a hardware wallet. Another option is to send a small amount to the wallet first and then attempt to spend it. Mostly though you have to trust the device. It's not really designed for people who question these things. Those people use software wallets instead.

backup the whole directory (aka data directory) where the wallet.dat file was found not just the file itself. that's cause sometimes you need more than just the wallet.dat file to restore your wallet.
after that you'll need to download bitcoin core and point it to one of the data directories. it asks you when you first start it where to place the data directory so just point it to one of those existing ones. then wait for it to download the blockchain which is 200GB of data. after it's done that you can see if you have any coins.

[Lightning]( is a technology that builds on bitcoin to enable faster and cheaper transactions. It is a second layer on top of the bitcoin blockchain layer. 
A bitcoin full node is software that has downloaded and verified the entire bitcoin blockchain from scratch. A lightning node is a bitcoin full node + lightning software that lets you interact with the lightning network and the base bitcoin network. That means you can provide liquidity to participants who want to route payments on lightning and earn transaction fees that way. OTOH Lightning is still in development and running a lightning node means you have to store bitcoin online so there's a risk attached to it. For instance someone might discover a flaw and steal your coins. So that's the risk/reward equation ATM.

no you don't. wordlist is not required to restore your wallet from seed. here try this seed:
`pronto moving energize lather 110 2213 resemble rival leisure gulp`
The wordlist is [here]( if you want to play with it but you don't need it to restore the wallet.


The seed version is encoded in the mnemonic so electrum will continue to support all such seeds. It's a well designed system.


With a bare private key you don't know where change will be sent. With an HD wallet change is always sent to an address in the external chain. It's a part of the bip32 standard.
I should also like to point out one other (relatively) [minor problem]( with private keys. If you don't know the corresponding address you won't be able to tell from the priv key alone. You'll have to try all types p2pkh, p2wpkh, p2wpkh-p2sh and any other types created in the future. With an electrum seed there is no such ambiguity since the script type is encoded in the seed mnemonic.

Yep but it also begs the question of what will happen to the price when it becomes easier to get bitcoins? People in rich countries struggle to buy 'em even though they usually have an exchange in their own country and have complete freedom to send money to exchanges abroad. So it's no wonder we third worlders struggle to get our hands on coins. When it becomes easier the price will increase many fold.
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:23:54
that's too small an amount. i suggest consolidating it into $100 a month and then withdraw that from the exchange maybe once every 6 months.
what you're trying to do is called dollar cost averaging (DCA) and studies have shown it doesn't give you the best bang for your buck. investing a lump sum gives you better returns. however for some reason people find DCA comforting so there's that.

Blockchain is gouging you here. Let's do the math shall we:
(175*148+44+175)/1000 = 26.119 kb
Transaction fee of 0.0005BTC/kb 
Total transaction fee = 0.0130595
Net BTC realised at target address = 0.07047255 - 0.0130595 = 0.05741305
0.0005 is actually a pretty high fee. You can go as low as 0.0001 and still have the transaction confirmed. I suggest extracting the private key of this address from blockchain and adding it to electrum. You can then send with a custom fee of 0.0001.

It's all just speculation isn't it? Take various assumptions, add a few facts and spin a nice tale. 
Anyway if gox goes down it will mean that bitcoin will crash. Maybe even to single digits presenting a good buying opportunity for those with the funds. But the price will recover, eventually. Maybe it'll take a few quarters but it will recover. Bitcoin is larger than gox.

Don't buy now. Instead focus on getting verified so you can buy in the future. If you want to know why please go through historical prices from around April-May this year. This sort of price rise invariably leads to a crash.

As someone else who lives in a third world country I can tell you that going local is your best option. There must be freelancers in your part of the planet who've got coins they need to offload? Localbitcoins is usually the best place for that. But if you can't find any then don't worry. Bitcoin is not going anywhere. There will be buying opportunities in the future.
In the meantime you can start reading. I see you don't know how a wallet works? Read about the underlying technology and you'll learn a lot so that when you finally do get some coins you'll be able to securely use them. The wiki is the first place to go to en.bitcoin.it. The second is the forum bitcointalk.org. Not having coins in hand might actually save you from loosing money to scams and mistakes early on.

The noose was tightening on Tangible Cryptography for a while now:
They changed banks from PNC to wells fargo. I speculate this is because PNC no longer wanted their business.
Then they stopped accepting international wires for their bitcoins direct service because of increased regulatory scrutiny. "We can't meet KYC requirements" they said. 
Before that they had stopped accepting cash deposits, money orders and other payment methods in the US.
They also lowered their fee considerably (1.99% down to 0.89%) for bitcoins direct which suggested increased risk on the part of their customers for using their services.

Well if I am going to use blockchain.info I might as well use their API:
"Want to send without a My Wallet account? If you do not have a My Wallet account $guid can be replaced with a hex encoded private key and the password parameters can be omitted. "
I already use this for a certain project. It's very easy and very fast. It has two downsides. One you are revealing your private keys to blockchain.info but that isn't a big deal if its a throwaway address that you are emptying anyway.
The other is that you have to depend on blockchain.info instead of your own server.
I'd like an alternative that is as fast as blockchain.info but does not use blockchain.info. Importing the private key into bitcoind takes multiple minutes so that won't work. I suppose I could work on createrawtransaction and all that low level stuff of bitcoind. That will require some experimentation until I understand how to do it right.

Don't use multi-bit because it doesn't allow you to encrypt your wallet.

Gox is in trouble. It is not processing fiat withdrawals fast enough so people are buying up bitcoins instead. This increased demand has pushed up the price of bitcoins on gox while depressing it everywhere else. Don't use gox if you want to buy bitcoins. For your first few purchases I recommend going real slow and buying small amounts from localbitcoins.com trusted sellers in your area. 
Then move up to an exchange (other than gox) if you can afford the wire transfer fees and the hassle. Remember to verify yourself with the exchange *before* sending them any money. That means id + proof of address scans. You should do this to avoid surprises in future. You don't want to find out in the future that they need you to submit dox just when you want to withdraw your money.

Can you provide a link to your site?
There could be a number of reasons why wordpress.com would not attract as many bitcoin users as a VPS host:
- Criminals would prefer the power they get with a VPS for spamming, DDoSing etc.
- Bitcoin is used by geeks and they don't want a restricted wordpress.com blog. They self host instead.
- Maybe wordpress.com is not promoting it right as you say. Or there is something about their system that makes it harder to use btc.

Er no. You can definitely stop a wire transfer before it is sent out. Banks even disclose the fee they charge for this service in their schedule of charges.

Electrum is better. Multibit use java which is always a pain to get started with, uses random keys which means you have to back it up often and has advanced features like multiple wallets that are aimed more at power users than newbs.

 Oooh that is sad. You've implemented a payment system that you don't even understand.  Bitcoin is unlike any other currency out there. 
It's high time you took a deeper look at bitcoin. Even a basic overview would have told that you that there is an upper limit of 21 million bitcoins that can ever be created. As a result the currency is deflationary and deflationary currencies reward those who spend little and save more.
 Do you have a link to those WP bitcoin stats you quote? I'd like to see the source please.

A paper wallet is not the same as an offline wallet. Electrum is not a paper wallet. You can however use it as an offline wallet on a system that does have a hard disk.
Here is the developer's opinion of this whole business:
If you like you can take it up with him in that thread or in a new thread in that forum. I think a debate on this matter can only be a good thing regardless of which direction it leads to.

Mt. Gox is clearly doomed. The thinking goes that if Mt. Gox crashes and burns while it is big it will cause the price of bitcoin to go down as well. So people are hoping that Mt. Gox looses customers to other exchanges and dies slowly without hurting the price of bitcoin too much.

It is too slow compared to centralized payment solutions. Those guys spend millions trying to shave milli seconds of their processing times while bitcoin can take tens of minutes to hours. So don't believe the propaganda you see here. Speed is relative and relative to other POS solutions bitcoin is slow. It is faster than SWIFT though but that is like a 70s system still in use. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 19:08:56
There are so many problems with bitcoins for users in developing countries. 
One problem is that the usual sites you wind up on like bitcoin.org and weusecoins.com encourage you to use the bitcoin-qt client. The reference client is the first and most prominent choice. It is also the "original" and the official client so people think it must be good. But the truth is that bitcoin-qt is no good to anyone on a 1Mbps connection! 
So IMO it would be better if these sites implemented some sort of geoip or net speed check before recommending a client. 
The other problem is that it is very difficult to get hold of coins locally. There are no local exchanges (localbitcoins is usually empty) and the only way to get coins is via international wire which not everyone can do or afford. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 03:10:53
Oh it'll be a lot more than the "off-chance". If your service becomes popular I can see a lot of emails ending up in junk mail boxes (false positives are a big problem) and the associated coins never being redeemed. 
You should increase the time limit to 6 months at least.

I think older transactions are not tracked by default:
"This release no longer maintains a full index of historical transaction ids
by default, so looking up an arbitrary transaction using the getrawtransaction
RPC call will not work. If you need that functionality, you must run once
with -txindex=1 -reindex=1 to rebuild block-chain indices (see below for more
IF the balance in your wallet is fine you shouldn't worry about it.

Don't patronize them. Tell them each bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places i.e. there are a 100 million satoshi in each coin. That should give them the perspective they need.

This comment of killerstorm does not deserve down votes. He is (mostly) right and you don't to have take my word for it. Read the source code:
Electrum generates a seed with 128 bits of entropy (not 256 bits). It then encodes that as a mnemonic for humans to remember.
The entropy of Electrum seeds is higher than the typical brainwallet passphrase because human beings suck at picking random words.

Let's see how many bitcoin related busts there have been in the last few weeks:
- Bitcoin-24 goes down after their bank accounts are frozen
- Bitfloor goes out of business for similar reasons
- Mt. Gox's US bank account and dwolla account gets frozen because they didn't cross their T's and dot their I's like they claimed they did. 
- And now liberty reserve is gone
So what next? Will Japanese police raid Mt. Gox offices?

Well this is good as far as bitcoin adoption goes. Maybe this is gandi's way of testing the waters to see if it might be worthwhile accepting bitcoins directly. 
But the price is too high if all you want is a domain. If you want the free addons then it might be worth it.
