I said the action is stupid. Not the individual. I’m not offended or anything. But I’m willing to bet anyone who has held bitcoin for over a year has made significantly more money than the ones who buy bitcoin and and jump from project to project.

Once, I inspired some dude who was filling out his deposit slip to crumble it up throw it away and get in line to do the same. It’s the little things that count for me. ��

I love walking into a bank and just gettin in line and then telling the teller what I want to do. Usually they tell me to fill out a deposit slip or something. I then loudly announce that I PAY fees to bank and use your service, don’t tell me I need to do the work.  God it’s so satisfying.

My mans said, “for everything else, there’s bitcoin cash.” Hey bro, I think master card already got that marketing campaign. ��������
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:21:06
I prefer to use ETH. Faster and cheaper to transact. I’m in USA so if I buy bitcoin - I have to pay huge fees to transfer because usd/BTC exchanges want you to keep your bitcoin with them so they charge (they choose not to update the protocol) 15$ fees to move bitcoin. 
Furthermore, if your buying bitcoins... and spending them elsewhere... your returns better be more that 1600% otherwise you’re losing lol. 
Just my opinion. Not saying one way is right.

Soooo, Facebook allowed people to be taken advantage of and it’s everyone’s own fault  because when they agreed to opt in to this “program,” they all knew exactly what they were getting into, is that the gist of what your saying? Further, to defend guilt by saying “well one time it was your fault” effects NONE of the other events in question.

I think the point of this was to remind everyone actions speak louder than words. In the midst of the libra hearing, I think it’s important to remember, they obviously are going to say the right thing. What they do when your not listening matters more

Yes. someone had brought this up and I get the process but. They use my data, which becomes “their data” that they use to sell their product which is ads based on my data. Pretty scammy if you ask me. And still technically selling my data. Maybe not my identity but I would argue still my data. Maybe you can convince me otherwise.

 Way ahead of you boss. Don’t have a Facebook. And People agree to take part in pyramid schemes, time shares and other fallacious businesses all the time. Doesn’t mean the business practice is not scammy.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:27:20
I concede to you, that, they don’t sell your “identity” to people.  May I present facebooks business model, but offline. 
“Hey mark! did I tell you I got a new job at the local summer camp this year. Thousands of kids ready to play outdoors, all summer!”
Mark logs this in his notebook. 
Later in the day a business man begins to talk with mark about his new product the water Weasel, A great summer toy for kids. 
Mark tells the businessman, “I know thousands of children who are at a summer camp! It would be wrong of me to tell you who they are, so, I’ll make you a deal. You pay me $1000 and because They shared it with me, I can sell (my access to them) to you. You cannot come to the summer camp though. Just provide me with the flyers you want to hand out. 
Scumbag-Mark or  I-respect-your-privacy-Mark is up for debate I guess.

The best part about Facebook is I can choose not to use it. I haven’t said I think what they do should be illegal or what they do is wrong, he’ll they get most of you to agree to giving it up lol but Their business practice is fallacious in my opinion. We don’t sell your data, we just store it and reference it for our own personal gain.
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:37:15
I’m not sure I quite understand the supply chain there. So they have the users data. Transform(?) it Into their own data. Then sell that?

BCASH allows an xploit for people who have purchased a program called ASICBOOST which can unfairly boost your profits as a miner by up to 30%. segwit fixed this in bitcoin and jihan didn't want to give up his exploit. so they crated bcash

Pretty easy to move the price if only 1-10 people are actively participating in your market.

I encourage you to do your own research, though from my understanding TL; kleinman suing Wright because they believe the moniker satoshi nakamoto was both Craig and kleiman therfore any and all of “satoshi’s” funds (which Craig claims to have) belongs to both parties. Craig doesn’t like to share though. He wants the world to believe he is the one and only creator. Problem is every time he’s provided evidence it has been proven fraudulent.
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:04:30
Clearly sarcasm not being detected in my OP that satoshi, notoriously anti government, would go to government to prove who he is.
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:15:29
He’s currently being sued for billions of dollars by the wife of Craig’s now dead partner,  claiming he stole a shit ton of bitcoins from their blind trust. 
Craig would have you believe that all the work and profit from their business belongs to him, including bitcoin THEY minded. 
Being satoshi is of some consequence in his lawsuit which is why he’s trying to hard to fool you into believing he is satoshi. He is slowly figuring out Judges are not as dump as plebes on the internet.

When buying a futures contract. Your buying a contract. Think of it like a sports bet. You are simply placing a bet the price will be higher or lower at the end of your contract.

That’s a first, never heard the price of bitcoin is relative to its day traders. �� �� I’m sure that’s why you got into crypto hahaha 
�� My solution of not buying shit coins daily is still a solution to your problem of, I lost money on a shit coin and the government won’t give me credit for the loss! Waa waa waaaa ������������������

I’m sorry you feel that way. History will not be on your side. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:11:37
I sorry to hear that. This post seems like your fishing for an answer  to validate you speculation. Truth is no one knows, if someone claims they do, run. If you actually think bitcoin will be a part of society in the future you should buy back in. If you’re in bitcoin specifically for financial gain, have fun playing that game and I hope it brings oh untold riches and lambos. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:16:21
Don’t put your rent/bills into crypto. Don’t take out loans or use credit cards. Use disposable income and don’t sell. The history of bitcoin is pretty clear, the longer you hodl the more you’ll make. Try and play the buy low sell high game and you will get burned, especially if you alter the last part of that and sell low. ‘Nuff said.

Have a good day man. Enjoy your day trading gains DUDE. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:00:38
Or... you could stop investing in a new shitcoin each day. Put your money in something that will be around more than a year, (assuming your not a in high tax bracket) your capital gain at the end of a year will be next to nothing, even as low as 0%. Yes 0%. 
All you Reddit kids think this constantly trading thing is how people make money in the stock market. Well you’re wrong. Day trading is, statistically, a way to lose all your money. 13% of ALL day traders even net a profit in any given year, of that, only 1% are able to repeat that for a following year.
