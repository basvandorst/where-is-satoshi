Localbitcoins... or a ATM that accepts cash. You will have some high fees from the local ATM though.

I find it hilarious that the banking industry says that mining crypto uses a lot of energy, when actual mining of a metallic element out of the ground has also increased in cost as well...
I can't believe that anything, let alone crypto, is more energy expensive than moving/processing [number between 2 and 100] tons of rock to get 1oz of gold...
If someone wanted to do the maths, I'm sure we could find both it being more and less expensive... But I just find it hard to believe that. But I'm willing to change my mind on it.

First and foremost, a tutorial on how to find stuff to buy. If nobody can find stuff to buy, then nobody will want to sell anything on there. This is crucial. If you can manage it, a video or maybe a few cards when you open the app to show the process?
But I really think that if you can get other nodes on the network to cache the data of other stores, that would be super helpful for the network as a whole. Maybe with a thing that won't let you see stores that are over X amount of days old or something.

It opens... but then what do I do? The search does not act like what I expect a search to act like... So it is really confusing. I realize it's a new technology, but when you have things like a search icon that doesn't do what you expect it to... it's kind of hard to get excited about it.

It's not censorship... You can still upload your videos--you just can't make money on them. Because the ads won't sell. If the ads won't sell, google isn't going to just hand you money when they didn't make any money on you...

No, i'm sure he means the whole phone encryption that everyone should have turned on with a fingerprint or long PIN to unlock.
Oh and you should not be rooted. Kind of pointless if anyone can get in and make a backup of your phone and extract the keys that way.

I was pretty sure that YTR was a separate thing for videos... That the money was calculated differently. Maybe you still get YTR money if the other ads can't play?

In all seriousness, this is an amazing product, that could be huge but it needs numbers. Without the numbers, it won't work. You might want to get with businesses and such to put these units on roofs of buildings and try and make them solar powered, so the network is robust enough in places.
@_date: 2016-09-02 23:42:04
Maybe they will change that since YTR accounts don't see ads, so maybe those will still fund the ones that can't get ads? I don't know.
All I do know is it is not censorship.

Well, I do kind of throw the OEM's under the bus. 90% of the time, they are the issue--they are already on the next phone and worried about selling the next Galaxy Droid X2 Special Pink LTE 4G BuzzWordSoup so they don't really care about the older phones.
The other 5% is the networks, saying they have to test and re-test the new versions of the OS... when the only thing they SHOULD be caring about is the radio because that is the only thing that connects to the network.
The last 5% is... Google. Yeah, they fuck things up too. I personally think that they should REQUIRE that OEM's absolutely have to make the drivers for the hardware available. This would make the non-updating phones MUCH EASIER to make custom roms for... As it is, they have to rip the drivers out of the phones, and if a phone is not popular... well... you might not get any updates ever.
But I have digressed WAAAAAY beyond anything related to Bitcoins here. So lets bring it back...
The problem with online wallets is that the chain of failure becomes way more than just an unpatched OS or a user being stupid about what they install. You instead have (potentially) dozens of routers between you and your wallet. And the location can change in an instant from US to Uzbeckistan so you are never really TRULY sure where your money is. Any one of those routers can be compromised and then suddenly you don't know if your server is your server anymore.
Personally, that is MUCH more of an issue to me. But I'm not a normal user. But normal users DON'T know that is an issue, and they will contniue to use web wallets. It is like all these people who switched over to credit unions when the banks went all FUBAR a while back.
Big banks: Oh you lost your card? Okay. Here is another one. Oh and they bought a bunch of stuff too? We will just give you that money back. No worries. Okay now, bye bye then! Oh and don't forget your points for buying stuff with our--I MEAN--'your' money!
Credit Unions: Okay here is your replacement card. That is $15. Oh and they bought stuff? Well, yeah. Don't lose your card. Sorry.
That, right there, is why Bitcoin won't ever take off with the normal public IMO. Period. Full stop. And there is nothing you can do about this, because if you could then the whole system is all just another fiat system...
@_date: 2013-09-05 01:49:57
No. The value something--currency, a goat, a bride--is only what each party agrees it is worth. I have no use for a goat so it is worthless to me. And a farmer in Africa wouldn't want a barrel of industrial sex lubricant. So that is worthless to him. But I like diamonds, and he likes bullets... So we can make a trade using those.
Right now it is easy to compare it with traditional currency to things for now... But if everyone is using the same standard virtual currency then the reason to keep it tied to physical things goes away. It won't be required anymore. Then your worry will go away as the use of whole coins won't happen that much.

Okay. Final question: what gets patched more often?
So there are more android devices in the wild, and they are farther back on patches? Why would I want to target anything else?

Trust no one. Everyone is a liability when it comes to this stuff.
What he should have done is make it so that after a day of him not touching a file or pinging a server, an automated process on a secure server somewhere should have started distributing the coins out to random public wallets.
That way everyone wins and the FBI has a nightmare scenario on its hands.

I do say 'usually' as it has been my experience in all the airports I have been to there has been one, but I can conceive of airports not having one for various reasons.
Mine is waaaaay out in the 'old' section where they put the private planes and small puddle jumpers. It is very inconvenient but better than endlessly circling the terminal, fighting the taxies and courtesy cars.

Then nothing will ever be able to satisfy you then. If it is all relative then it will always be in a state of flux.
So tell me again what are you blathering on about if you say everything will always and forever be in flux?
I just want to be rid of banks. That's all I care about. Between fees, finance charge, interest, crappy "working" hours, delays in processing payments, arbitrary cutoff times for a business day, and just endless streams of corporate and bureaucratically insane levels of bullshit...

No. I meant that once everyone is on the same page as far as the units of currency is concerned, then you will see it become more uniform and less volatile to prospects in the market.

The USB sticks have a processor on them that calculates the hash of the blockchain. The more sticks you have, the faster you can hash. If you get the hash, then you get a bunch of bitcoins and hooray!

You keep saying "Value" in context of both Bitcoin and the term 'Money'. I do not think it means what you think it means. Nothing has absolutely ANY 'value' unless both parties assign a value to it and agree on the value for trade. This was what I was eluding to with my diamonds and sex jelly and goats.
Gold has NO intrinsic value. It is not food, it is not shelter. SIlver has no intrinsic value. It is not food, it is not shelter. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It is not food, it is not shelter.
Bananas have intrinsic value. It is food, and the leaves can be used to make shelter. Oranges have intrinsic value. They are food, and they fight off the scurvy. Salt has intrinsic value. It is required by the body to create electrolytes (Something I hear your body craves) and also to preserve food for those long winter months.
Trees have intrinsic value. They create shelter, and they also help create fire. They can also be made into pointed sticks so that in the off chance you have to defend yourself against a man armed with a Banana, you will have something to poke him with.
All of those things can be either through gathering them yourself, or by TRADING for them with shiny shit that you mine/find/create out of the ground. But, when push comes to shove--nobody can eat Gold, Silver, 
To that end, you will literally never EVER have a 'stable' currency ever again. Why is that? The only reason you had one to begin with was that the US dollar was--at one point--backed by a single standard that the entire world agreed upon. GOLD.
Why did they agree upon it? Because it was universally accepted the world over BEFORE the banks existed. Banks were invented because of gold. Banks were the reason that gold could be used as a single point of referance for everything... And why did it fail? Because men are greedy, greedy GREEDY little piggies and you cannot trust them for one second because they will stab you in the back.
Bitcoin trusts no one. And the code is there for everyone to see. Nobody can hide anything, or game it so that they can control it. And if someone does, then it is patched and life moves on.
All. Currency. Is. Merely. A. Placeholder. For. Food or Shelter. Period. FULL STOP. END OF FILE. TERMINATE ALL COMMUNICATION.

Your argument is flawed by the simple fact that you don't get that each 'coin' can be divided down to .00000001 of a 'coin'.
There are potentially more Satoshi than there are people on the planet. So there is no need for it to be "equivalent" to a dollar/quarter/dine/Nicole/penny because the worth of a bit coin is not tied to the price of rice, gold, a goat, a barrel of oil, or how many wives you can buy.

Said it before, sad to say I will have to say it again:
Never ever keep money in a online/virtual wallet. Keep it local on you (phone) or on your home PC, or cold storage.
