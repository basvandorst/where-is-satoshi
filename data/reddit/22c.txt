Saw a bunch of blogspam in the new queue, as far as I can tell this article is the original source.

Mt.Gox is based in Tokyo, so it's a time when the site admins would likely be asleep.

I agree with you, and the important thing to note here is that the majority of people currently buying bitcoins aren't using them. Sooner or later people are going to realize you can't buy a house with bitcoins.

If I had money in Mt.Gox I'd test the minimum buy quantity myself.
