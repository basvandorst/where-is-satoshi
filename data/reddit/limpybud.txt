You see, that's what I was predicting to my friends, I'm sure he is not the only one doing it, and that kind of merchants will be more and more in near future

Didnt see this first time around, the girl didnt even post the correct bitcoin addy in youtube comments 
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:45:24
It's a shame to see this, someone who has put a lot of work into bringing something like bitcoin and helping make it what it is today now being treat like this by those as you say by those who could make the most of it.
Wish him all the luck.

Great news from Canada! Love it!  The more good news we hear from other countries the more unstoppable bitcoin becomes (though I'd argue it's already unstoppable!!)
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:37:52
That is definitely one of the more unique analogies I have ever read regarding the USD. Lol.
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:39:31
Really good article for the beginners as it is based on truly situation with BTC. Still there's no pressure on your own view. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 07:28:21
I'm surprised that there aren't more in NYC, there's only two; Manhattan and Brooklyn.
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:26:41
that's a pitty I see this picture just right now! It could be a great postcard for my friend

The mixing service are greatly helpful for those who are doing things illegal but the charging are kinda high
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:25:00
i think he will never do this because he would hurt his own invention. maybe he destroyed the keys of the early mined btc.
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:33:00
You'll have a problem if your girlfriend see this post
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:39:00
There's a little more to bitcoin beside gambling, I daresay, huh?
@_date: 2014-07-28 09:10:03
useful for sending signed tx's. but not useful for whole blockchains. so keep this concept to signed tx's only
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:51:10
Hmm... illegal it or legal when people understand all the advantages of it they won't care about legality, I'm sure.
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:37:12
I don't belive this. where is the proof?
@_date: 2014-07-28 06:29:05
haha, nice one
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:36:55
The idea is pretty good!
@_date: 2014-07-28 09:04:53
I'm curious about this, when the last block of bitcoin will be mined, what will happen?
@_date: 2014-08-31 22:34:02
f you think of changing a crypto currency to a physical one then govt is not stupid enough to not deny  this idea..even possibly make BTC illegal.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:05:59
please apple don't kick it out again this time, counting on it being there now lol
@_date: 2014-07-28 06:22:18
"however I'm not here to speculate."
"....Let's say BTC jumps to 5k per coin,"
Could hve fooled me.
@_date: 2014-08-25 07:26:41
That's an easy one: transaction time, transaction time and transaction time.
Imagine if everything was the same except  your transactions confirmed instantly (or almost instantly). The transaction times are really the only problem I see with Bitcoin in it's current form.
I guess blockchain size as well, but that's not the main thing as most people are using online or light clients anyway.
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:49:24
I don't think that's the most important thing
@_date: 2014-07-28 09:04:56
My 2 cents:
The miners will gain only transaction fees so the electric cost will be higher than the revenue,
therefore the number of miners will drop drastically and the chances of 51% attacks will be huge.
Conclusion: when the last block will be mined, bitcoin will die.
@_date: 2014-07-14 08:25:06
Does coinbase.com do that? 
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:23:35
Well, we'll see what they are going to create that could compete with Bitcoin. Still, don't understand why they need to create something new if they are doing money on speculation?
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:24:11
that's great! I hope they open more there
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:33:33
a bitcoin application that works as intuitive as that is a miracle. We will never have it!
@_date: 2014-07-28 09:10:01
sending the blockchain through sound.. hmm thats the equivalent to using dialup to download a 20gb file. but without the ability to check packets are complete without errors.
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:14:53
I haven't heard about Duck Duck Go. What's this?
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:31:19
Thanks ! I am the beginner and also was curios about it.
Glad to see there's still kind people who are willing to share their knowledges.
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:48:15
"Sorry guys" what else he can say now...
@_date: 2014-08-31 22:33:12
While providing loans what actually people do with the BTC you lend them?Isn't lending over a community without proper credit system be more risky than mining?
@_date: 2014-07-14 08:01:53
This is huge. Honestly even if "wall street" never buys into btc, if your average middle class investor puts some money in to btc that would be enough to fuel growth.
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:20:39
Bitcoins are 5 years only. Is he writing in a foreign language?
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:48:03
it takes 94 days!!! that's too much!
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:45:07
I am also a little lost
I thought the whole point of cryptos is to get out of the bubbles that the fractional reserve banking business entails
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:25:40
Hahaha awesome! now i'll always see him this way too
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:23:53
it is strange,there is some details which are not clear at all
we will have to take it with caution until we see more details about the party
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:35:37
"People don't kick dead dogs." These articles are a sign that these people are losing marketshare to bit coin. If it wasn't a threat they would simply ignore it.
@_date: 2014-07-14 08:02:01
No, they've just decided to use Realcoin as it fits better into their ideology.
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:17:22
How is bitcoin or any virtual currency supposed to trade on eBay? In no way! :(
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:35:27
If I were paid BTC just for blogging I would feel very good too
@_date: 2014-07-28 06:19:22
so, how do you find it?
@_date: 2014-07-28 09:04:25
It's a low-cost airline, they charge for pretty much everything. Still good news, they took BTC on board...
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:38:05
WoW !!! Awesome. This is gonna be huge.
Is it US only or across the globe ?
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:22:59
it will be the best bus ride if I pay BTC for it!
