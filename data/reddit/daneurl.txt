Bitcoin is the socialization of currency. It is finally out of the hands of big financial corporations and bankers. It is undermining (nice pun there) the power of the financial institutions around the world and thereby JP Morgan, Wall Street etc. Imagine no P&amp;L accounts? 
Bitcoin is a real threat. It just needs someone to make it more accessible and available in a language that every day folks can go "yeah I get that" and that is where you need real marketing expertise. Bitcoin is still a "nerds" tool. Market it well (like convincing people that bottled water is better than tap water) then everyone will be involved.

Pretty much why noone else is using bitcoin.

And the previous investigative journalist who was murdered uncovering links from the Maltese gov to russian mafia. Great.

I stand corrected and thanks. Azerbaijan mafia (the ruling family in other words) Russian loan sharks and Italian mafia are in control of the current Maltese government.

I agree. He disrupted government sources of income and gained shit loads of money. Plus the war on drugs is a sham as nearly every person in Wall Street, government, and so on take huge amounts of cocaine and other substances and they are complete hypocrites. Decriminalise them and you'd see 1000's of silk road type sites and they would become worthless.
