I was hoping to get some insight into what was going on by going to the comments but no of course this sub has gone to shit and is now flooded with to the moon quotes. seriously? what the actual fuck is wrong with this community.  i'm un subscribing from all reddit bitcoin subs because everyone here has proven themselves incompetent and immature. however I did learn a lot here when I was a newb but that's what this community has turned into a bunch of kids watching bitcoinity and jizzing in there pants every time the price moves more than 2%

this might be what you were referencing?
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:25:02
my wife has one of these but i've never used it for keys...
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:08:40
Are we both talking about the neo and bee thing? Because I think that's supposed to work like a card. But what I was referring to is how I pay for stuff with BTC, ATM.

Well you asking if you can make any money with cpu mining is like asking if you can make money by walking around with a shovel and searching for buried treasure. Also a gpu would probably be a better choice anyways

This happened to many people around that same time. there was a glitch where people were seeing some amount of coins remain in their account after it had been withdrawn so they canceled all orders in que then had to get that sorted out before they could resume buy/sell orders. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:31:42
I feel better for selling at 140 now. sorry about the shitty luck.
@_date: 2013-10-14 14:13:26
I'm pretty sure shits going to hit the fan on Thursday so I've been buying all that I can... 
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:14:38
That's pretty creepy of coinbase... 
@_date: 2013-10-26 04:46:12
And there was a whole lot of price fluctuation during this time. Not sure if that had something to do with it. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:39:29
I was thinking that as well but thats also relative since it basically started from 0.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:22:40
I don't know where in the process it is. I guess they are mailing checks or something? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:30:21
I just had usd left in my account and literally just finished submitting my info before seeing this.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:26:43
possibly the shittiest time to buy. sorry bro...
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:48:25
thanks for that explanation. that makes a lot more sense now.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:29:33
good one!
@_date: 2013-09-25 21:42:02
just did. I was surprised it hadn't been posted yet.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:29:50
Just sent you a buck. Even if you are lying. (I don't think you are) you need that . 002 btc more than I do. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:38:11
I don't know enough about Bitcoin to put it on record but just wanted to say I love vices video's and articles. Thanks for the great journalism! 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:43:43
what do you think about something for the vendors that would take the BTC as soon as they accept the order and instantly converts it to the market price in usd or whatever currency so they would have minimal time to lose out on wild market shifts? just a thought.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:00:25
nah, i'm not in line go ahead. i'm just listening... a little creepy
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:35:20
why is bitstamp so much cheaper?
@_date: 2013-09-24 23:49:17
I listen to pretty much all of his podcasts and he has started mentioning bitcoin a lot more lately. david seaman also mentions bitcoin a lot.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:44:22
I didn't think he was I was just curious what he was referring to.
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:32:11
[coinbase]( has a pretty good setup as well.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:57:28
what I did is buy bitcoin then transfer to a service like btc-e  then trade btc to other cryptos or to usd then to other cryptos. thats the easiest way I found but i'm sure there are others to buy them directly.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:48:15
what was the price 2 weeks ago? .8 usd/mBTC? you would still be up a few bucks.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:22:56
You obviously already know the role of Bitcoin in a world economy. So why even ask 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:52:58
i'm in the u.s.a and I did it.
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:16:04
That was me :) 
@_date: 2013-09-25 14:37:45
I'm not going to go digging through the old ones cuz they're 3 hours long but i'll post it here next time he mentions it.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:37:50
sorry I don't get your reference. are you reffering to  usa gdp or something?
@_date: 2013-09-25 21:42:36
that's pretty sweet. did you get to see the lab or did you just meet up for coffee or something?
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:03:35
There are many I noticed in 2011 from the top 500 list can  anyone tell me what this means? Are they lost forever or just in cold storage or what are your thoughts? Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:33:27
Associated press
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:33:09
I just bout stuff on amazon with BTC through Gyft! it was instant and awesome!
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:47:39
Let me know if/how this is stupid but they should implement something in the future or once all the coins are mined to collect these coins and re distribute them through mining if Thats even possible. Maybe only the unencrypted ones could somehow be brought back into circulation? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:58:53
I imagine it was one of those buy 4 bitcoins get. 025 free or something. Just down vote those to oblivion! 
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:48:28
They could be In cold storage but I was thinking after like 100 years or so they have probably been lost thus could be re introduced into the system. I understand they can be divided as much as needed but for most people there is sort of a psychological hurdle to using.  . 0000000001 of something 
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:29:41
you could try ltc...
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:24:15
I would say buy a small amount right now. but once or if drops back down to 150$ that would be a good time to buy. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:50:14
you can go through  the fees add up to around around 6%
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:38:33
so mt gox. should drop to 79? i'm just not sure how they corelate with eachother.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:46:49
thats probably part of the crash... oh no BTC only worth .87 usd?! better sell all of them!
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:15:46
I was thinking if the US really wanted to kill it they could just buy us all out. Even though at this point they would only have half and the miners would still have the rest. But then they could just use that huge nsa center in Utah to mine the rest. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 01:32:04
Did it show up at the other address? If not I would say wait an hour or so... 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:51:37
oh and you're limited to like 70$ the first few times then it goes up to 140$ after awhile.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:53:35
thanks. I guess I should've just googled it first.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:42:17
I did pretty good when I was actively trading and paying attention. my mistake was trading to fiat then leaving it at that for a few days or even over night then come back the next day to find the price of BTC sky rockets and im left with 300 dollars when I could have 1 btc worth 500. I pulled out after the last time that happened around 300-400$ and just said screw it i'm in this for the long haul no need to stress over daily changes and i'm so glad I did now that were over 600$ per btc! (i'm still constantly checking prices, I need to fix that issue with myself)
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:30:53
I thought you were being a dick until I remembered op... 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:33:52
Swiping a card is a hell of a lot easier than pulling out your phone and scanning a qr code and entering all of your passwords
