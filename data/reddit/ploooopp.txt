But having an account on Gdax via coinbase you've got to add to your euro account and stuff, it takes days before the stuff goes through and my bank is super slow, but I'll read up on your suggestions. Thank you!

Cool, I'm guessing you don't need complex hardware for it? I've got stuff laying around I'd be willing to take a stab at it. If I set the fees to negative does that mean I get deducted btc?

I had about 3k$ in at the bank, it had gone up by 1,56% in a year. I decided to put that amount in bitcoin and in under a month I've made a 86% profit since then I've steadily invested every week or so with varying amounts and I'm planning not to touch it until atleast 2020. I'm not saying anyone will have a similar kind of success it just feels better having my money somewhere where it doesn't feel like it's just collecting dust.

Damn it, I feared that.... Well that's a pretty big lesson but yeah I'll keep that in mind

Can you actually earn bitcoin by running a node?
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:32:02
Is high node fees the reason why transaction fees are high? (Thanks for the help!) would a rpi 2b work? Got one of those besides the pc hardware 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:15:33
Nah, I'd admit my stupidity, but I get you, it's more plausible I did it, I just want some help tbh 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:37:53
Okay, so if you can't make any btc from it, what's the incentive to host a node? Genuinely curious

What kind of shady shit?
I'm not the best at stocks and don't find it that interesting. Tbh I'm kind of scared I may be enjoying gambling too much but I'm getting help to sort that out asap, I'm too young to have a gambling problem already :)

What about buying it via Gdax and keeping it in the coinbase wallet for about 5 years?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:01:56
Because I'd like to be able to buy exactly 3 bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:05:49
That is fair I've never thought of that, any good suggestions? Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:12:45
I know I don't have to :) I would just prefer a round number, in that case I'll go for something around 3.005?

Is there any way to buy in bitcoin via Gdax, I'm getting some for myself and I would love to be able to buy a round number for example 3.000btc and whatever the cost is in euros that's okay, right now I can only buy in euro/usd which makes it difficult to get a round number of btc in the end
