I have always been a Bitcoin fan, from the moment I first read about it years ago. I supported the Blockchain, and the complete Core, however I’ve always been wary of the Futures market, and I cautioned the community as to when WallStreet gets involved with ANYTHING Government soon follows. Sure enough along comes the Futures Market, and we all knew the price would moon, which it did. 
Now that the major WallStreet Wales have inflated the price, I believe the price was intentionally pumped, which brought in many, many more investors a lot of smalls threw in what little they could. And like clockwork the Wales have now pulled the rug out from underneath our coin. Sending everyone for cover, and causing losses to those who should have not been here in the first place.
We will survive this current bloodbath, but all the hype for this instant free money has cost many to loose even more. I wish there were warnings instilled upon all new accounts to know what you are doing before you jump on board on an investment that is now manipulated by WallStreet and government. Some of you will claim it is not controlled, as it is decentralized so it cannot be controlled. Who is China, Korea (both), now tell me the IRS is not government.

If I worked at Pepsi cola, I would definitely be holding Coca Cola, simply because I would know what my competition's market was. Hence I would Hold, Coca-Cola.

That is simply the cost of doing business, if they don't want to do what is required, they should not be doing business.

Perhaps you should stop with the bullshit black market things, if you have garnered any knowledge at all about what you just shot out your pie hole, you would know, with a Shift Card, or a BitPay Card both being issued by Visa, anywhere you can use a debit card you can use use the cards mentioned. There are other cards available so educate yourself. 
I would venture a guess you are the type who wished he invested back when it was a quarter. I highly doubt you knew how to create an account without your mommies help.

Actually with today's technology his coin addresses could be recovered, EVEN on a Hdd that is crashed OR wiped.
I have been in IT, for 20+ years, and done this kind of recovery many times, it is very time consuming. But I’ve been successful in doing it with great success. I have looked up the guy who lost his coin, but his email is private, and he has not logged in on bitcointalk.org since 2014. If anybody knows him, I’m easy to find.

yes, "Saying she misses him, could you come over, and bring money" all they are after. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 15:12:38
No, she is controlling him. Her entire body language is controlling HIM. When she says "It is so Stupid", she squints her eyes looking directly at him, like she was transferring that remark to him. and he got the message. My advise to him Walk Away.

It started back in 1985 or so I went to Sears to find me a computer was working two jobs, Full time for a major tire manufacturing company in Quality Control. Also farmed a bit of land, raised some hogs, had a couple hundred up on pin's that never touched the ground, ground and mixed my own feed, a couple hundred chickens etc.
 
The bottom fell out of the hog industry as it did for most farmers. 
Living out in the country was my dream come true, then the farming industry collapsed and after a death in the family, I was forced to sell the farm. So mostly out of boredom. I went to sears, and I read everything about computers went to the stores read every book I was starved for everything Computer related, I bought a Vendex Computer that had (2) 5 1/4" drives that required both drives to be loaded / removed and inserted at various times just to get to a screen. Which was mostly DOS,then I had to learn DOS, so I could interact with the system. 
DOS, What's DOS....back to the computer store. Reading everything I could and learning everything I could, Soon I found people around me Asking Me Questions and I would help those whom I could. Then Windows 3.0 came out....Back to the Computer Store. Soon I fixing all the computers around me, I retired from my major tire manufacturing company, and started up a computer store, fixing, repairing software problems, but mostly people problems, Built systems (still do) I remember when the Internet was a Black Screen with White Text. 
Yes, Bitcoin is fascinating, have my nodes running. Yes, I am 70 years old. I understand NEVER stop learning. Why would you ?
Forgot to mention I play WoW..and have since Aug.5th 2005

Yes, I agree once you hit say 38 - 40 you add 5 lbs to your weight, per year, and there is not a damn thing you can about it. What used to be around your chest is now sitting on your belt. I watch what i eat not in calories or nutrients, but in serving size and I never go back. One plate and Im done. I was 6'2" and as time passes you also loose some of that which exasperates the problem. Still weigh in at 225, so I'm still mobile, hopefully never want to become dependent on my family. But I am wise enough to know, things change. There is no time in a bottle. Now Crown is another thing.    (grins)
