You're right, I'm not justifying my actions in any way. Fortunately, I bought my bitcoins when they were $11 so I didn't lose any investment. Lesson learned.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:26:30
I found the malware, it is a keylogger.
A process named aticlexx.exe in a folder named AMD Frameworks system  There was a dll file in that same folder and when I opened it with notepad++, there's all my keystrokes. Damn.
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:06:20
I found the router log, but how would I match up the timestamp? Blockchain.info is showing 2014-04-10 03:53:59 and my electrum client is showing 2014-04-09 20:54  should I look for an entry in the log that has 53 or 54 seconds? Any idea what port?
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:20:23
I think the web host for that site is  which I guess means the guy is probably in Australia
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:21:46
Yep, coinmap is where I checked first, no such luck there! Not sure what that other guy was referring to about 'the dumpster'
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:59:13
I'm not good with that kind of stuff, but I'm guessing you mean I should log into my router configuration via my web browser and look in there?
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:32:56
Yep, seems to be, this sucks... my fault
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:38:05
Your coins were stolen, just as mine were, see my post:
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:07:41
Thanks I appreciate that
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:58:04
Yes you're correct about electrum. Just try to ensure that the computer you use is clean of virii and malware.
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:49:10
Nope, not a bitter taste for bitcoins.. In fact, I'm hoping the price tanks more so I can buy again.. Question though, how can they actually be stolen from Electrum?
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:12:18
Sounds like localbitcoins is the way to go
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:04:02
I'm pretty sure I did, placed a few bets....
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:21:00
does that mean that my btc could be tied up for as long as 30 days? That sounds scary to me, who knows what could happen in 30 days right?
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:20:48
Well, the coins haven't moved yet, keeping an eye on that address on the blockchain...
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:01:44
No, I was just fooling around with brain wallets and got to thinking
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:45:22
Localbitcoins.com lol.. Bring a sniper with you ;-)
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:54:48
Thank you, I'll check with Bitstamp..
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:15:15
Yeah apparently so.. Oh well
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:32:31
Screw it... Just keep btc for the long haul
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:43:44
Couldn't he simply just change the address from that 1NuNVD now that he probably knows people are on to him? I just don't see any chance of recovering them.. I sent him a PM on the bitcointalk forum asking nicely for my btc back....
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:16:38
Thanks man... your hunch was right.. Well, watching the price of btc continue to go down, I must just be able to get back in, paper wallet no doubt the next time.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:00:27
I'm curious to know if you recovered your husband's bitcoins? 
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:43:53
Does anyone want to look at my router log? I see a lot of strange things...
@_date: 2014-04-09 22:57:15
I also have the password for the encryption. Can I still check it at brainwallet?
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:12:01
Trust me you were hacked. I was today too. Did you go to collect coins.net? Yours and mine are the only two transactions. I lost a lot more than you..
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:25:31
I know they get hacked by programs, but I was wondering if any person just randomly hit on a phrase that worked and found (and stole) btc. My guess is probably not...
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:49:35
Electrum on the PC (nice not to have to backup due to the seed feature) and Mycelium on the android phone.
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:17:19
that was one you guessed?
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:15:12
Sounds like this guy just goes from one scam to the next! 
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:38:26
I'm with you.. But how?? The domain is registered private...
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:13:14
Yup, Electrum is awesome
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:55:47
You make some good points there.. How many bitcoins do you use for lending? I guess it's all relative to what you have.. I'd just hate for bitfinex to go under.  Aside from that happening, is there any risk in the lending itself? 
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:11:11
But how could he have gotten the wallet file itself if all this was was as key logger?
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:16:48
is that the name of the place?? haha
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:55:05
I don't recall reading that in their terms
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:08:48
I wish I had your problem
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:44:20
I wouldn't be quick to say that it's actually impossible. But I would agree that he would have had to seen it probably a number of times and its entirity in order to being recalled. You say his coins are on an old computer. Did something happen with that computer did the hard drive crash?
@_date: 2014-02-05 03:46:20
Looking forward to your next great YouTube video!
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:54:00
I sort of tried this but the interest rate was trivial when lending bitcoins as opposed to cash... Maybe I didn't set it up right?
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:26:35
Here's his/her youtube channel:
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:21:39
So when you set up a swap to lend your btc out, what is your process, or what settings do you use (Period, rate, # swap contracts) and then there's another tab called autorenew that have period and rate. Do those override what you set in the offer swap tab? Seems confusing to me, maybe I'm understanding it wrong....
@_date: 2014-04-10 06:44:55
I tried lending on Bitfinex but that sucked.. Going to check out the one you mentioned.. Can you ELI5 the fee shares? Do you earn more with that or with interest on your deposit?
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:59:33
You're right.  I still don't understand how having my password key logged would enable him to actually send himself the bitcoins though.  Isn't that something that has to physically be done in Electrum?
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:45:12
I just logged into my account and the lowest offer is around .03% which isn't exactly very high and demand around .011%.. Thoughts?
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:42:48
I think he's in Australia though, why would he (and can he even) use coinbase or bitstamp if he's not in the US?
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:32:49
What kind of cell phone did he have? If android you can check his play store search history to look for any btc related apps such as blockchain or mycelium.  I echo whomever said to not throw out anything at all. Did you find paper wallets in the safe? Learn what a private key vs a public btc address look like... If and when you find any addresses, AND you know which is public and which is private, then you can post the public address here and someone here will tell you how many btc are at that address.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:54:19
Oh! I forgot! Go to YouTube and watch the videos on a channel called WorldBitcoinNetwork His are some of the best and they will help you understand so many things!!!
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:48:20
Just a plain text file with that string in it? 
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:27:21
how do I decrypt the key?
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:09:02
Looked at your balance...I hope they pay you soon!
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:14:16
Thanks, I contacted them as well, haven't received a reply as of yet.
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:53:12
Yes, it was, I had a password to send coins from the wallet
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:32:50
Very true but I was considering her level of tech. understanding
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:03:30
looks good!
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:19:21
I found this:
but damn I don't have a color printer at the moment!
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:52:45
no idea really, I wouldn't even get something cutting edge if all it's going to be used for is offline bitcoin stuff. Don't know where you live, but you could pick up something really cheap, yet new, from Frys Electronics.. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:34:45
It seems to me that the failsafe for x number of years in the future is to have the actual private key(s) on hand that the future heir or whomever will be able to import into whatever the current mainstream client is at that time. Would that be an accurate statement? 
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:19:41
Some might say to completely disconnect the power to the hard drive when you are running Ubuntu. Could be considered paranoia, but then again, if you had thousands, or even millions of dollars tied to a private key, you'd be paranoid too =)
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:35:09
Is BIP0038 the same as using a seed in Electrum?
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:49:07
That's 1/1000th of a bitcoin, correct?  How are you giving them the wallet? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:13:00
I just tried restoring an Electrum wallet on a different computer with the seed and it worked like a charm. I knew it would work, but it was another thing to see it actually happen. Gotta love the seed.
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:06:48
So you set them up on blockchain.info - Do you just send them an email with their login and password or how are you delivering the "gift"
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:19:33
I looked for anything that indicated notifications but did not see it, maybe because I am new?
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:56:58
Ahh ok, seems like the easiest way. You'll be on tech support on Christmas day lol
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:23:40
I'm concerned about this as well. I'm 33, suppose I die in a car wreck tomorrow, I'd want my parents to have access to the bitcoins, but how exactly do you leave something to senior citizens who don't even know what a bitcoin is let alone how to access, spend, cash out, etc. If I leave them the private key, and they seek help from someone in-the-know, that person could simply steal the coins. I suppose I need to write some kind of fail safe step by step instruction on what to do and how to do it, leaving nothing to guess. In the meantime, I'll try not to die...
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:07:55
Thank you for the info!! btw, do you know how to get notified of new replies on reddit? I still can't find that option.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:44:17
Considering the current and potential value for these coins, I might just buy a cheap laptop devoted (i.e. never connected to the internet) to wallet related stuff.  Seems like a small investment to protect a rather large one!
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:13:25
Their site is operating just as they claim it should. I buy GHS, it automatically mines and I get paid out my share from the mining effort.. at 130GHS, it's not a whole lot, but I've made a decent amount with these payouts, as well as trading GHS. If I make even 1 full bitcoin and the value of bitcoin goes up a lot in the coming years, then that 1 bitcoin could be worth thousands and I didn't really have to do much work to get it.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:36:56
That's awesome, I wish I would have thought of this gift idea sooner.. Too late to send to family for christmas now. I might just go the blockchain.info route and send them an email with maybe a youtube video about bitcoins and a link to their online wallet...
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:42:53
Thanks, still confused but at least I know it's not the same as the seed,, baby steps for this noob =)
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:13:15
I don't understand what is bad about cex.io It earns me bitcoin while I go about my day. I can sell the GHS for bitcoin whenever I'm ready to stop. Why is this bad?
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:41:48
Wow thanks!! That's exactly what it was. Ran as administrator and it worked! Thanks again!
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:51:37
CEX.io platform works like a charm, payouts like clockwork
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:04:13
Thanks, I missed that somehow! I have a very basic understanding of the whole seed thing. But from what I do understand, as long as I know my seed, I can restore my entire Electrum wallet, on any computer, at any time in the future. That's simply amazing to me! By the way, I am new to reddit, do you know how to get email notification of new comments to posts?
