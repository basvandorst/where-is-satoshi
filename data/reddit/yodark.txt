What don't you understand ?
The fact the cards are stored on the bitcoin blockchain ? Works a bit like colored coin
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:30:07
Because its not only the currency but the game assets as well. For exemple you can sell *magical sword* for 1BTC This way you have no intermediaries. You send me my magical sword I send you the BTC and its all settled in the blockchain
@_date: 2015-12-02 18:47:11
I'm also using intensively the notification API any other solution trigger an URL when something happens to an address coinkite have that ?
@_date: 2015-06-25 17:27:46
Sounds interesting I understand the benefit but can someone ELI5 if someone display his identity passcard on a random website how do I know he is the only who was able to display that identity ? 
@_date: 2015-06-23 12:43:35
A little bit of self promotion here but we are using counterparty for our game asset.  this way we can store game asset on the bitcoin blockchain and enjoy freedom of decentralisation. For example in our game Spells of Genesis you can buy a "legendary sword" as this sword is a digital asset we (game studio) have no control over it you are free to trade it for a "magic shoe" or BTC. When a game asset is yours it's yours no one can lock take it from you and you can even build another game using it
@_date: 2014-05-21 17:10:56
The other block symbolises the paralel validations. Look at the blockchain representation on this page [genesis!]( 
@_date: 2014-06-30 15:29:38
Depends it's a bitcoin in, bitcoin out system. If you are a regular "newbe" user ideopass works like paypal there are no key as your money it's kept in the currency you are confortable with (USD, EUR...) if you are a power user and you want to hold bitcoin ideopass is using a multisig system. You hold one of your key on your card combined with your personal password. We keep one key on our server and you keep the last key on your paper backup

You can see all bitcoin art done so far here : 
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:46:23
Good question,
Legally it's nothing complicated. People can buy mines and mines produce gems. Gems are part of the gameplay (premium currency) so as game producer we can distribute gems to any one we like. The only thing is game assets are decentralised. So players are free to transact the items as they like without us being in the middle. People can sell or share items to each other.
Let's imagine I produce a golden sword. Instead of having the golden sword on our database linked to a player account. The golden sword is a counterparty asset on the blockchain. We allow any player who control the private key to use this golden sword in the game.
What would be here the legal issue ? The concept is very new of course but in my point of view there is nothing refraining someone to create digital asset asset and nothing refraining someone to sell a digital asset to someone else.
 
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:07:49
Yeah it's not out yet but at least it's the first game who has been announced from an experienced game studio  where the games assets are blockchain based.
It's also started to be produced as we have a working prototype and we created artwork and characters related to the cryptocurrencies.

We are working on a new expansion of our trading card game. The game will not only accept bitcoin payment but it will be an allegory of the crypto currency. We are designing on a fantasy setup all crypto currency elements such as miners, blockchain, speculators etc.

@_date: 2014-10-29 13:24:01
Amazing ! 
I'm saying that because I'm in the team !
Thank you hnin for relaying the info !
@_date: 2014-10-29 22:16:35
Thank you for your questons


I think this could be a long debate :) but here we want to take a bold statement. Of course we didn't invented it but we were among the fist to use it. In the end it's what customer wanted (free stuff) people hate to pay even if it's 1 USD. I have a lot of friends, the first thing they asked after talking about the game I'm working on " Oh is it free ?" understood that they won't download it if it's 1$. In the end it's the users who decide the way the industry evolves. But I agree since then big publishers polished their monetization strategy in order to maximise the profits. This is why we want to change the model


I don't exactly get what you mean there. Do you mean it cost nothing more than 99$ to create a game ? While we are selling digital asset that does cost nothing ?
For Moonga (our previous game) for example we are selling pack of cards.
For example here - 
 The cost of production imply
- Wages of support / community manager staff
- Wage of developper who maintain/improve the game
- Wages of marketing staff
- Wage of game designer who produce content
- Cost of running server
- Cost of illustration
For spells of orbital the cost of developing the game will be around 200'000 that we are crowdfunding. The running cost are the same as for Moonga


We are pretty advanced in the game drafting with a working prototype. We are slowly giving out giving more info. Like in any Kickstarter project the game are only ingame footage and game concepts. Here we are pre crowdsale. While kickstarter model has been proven here we are also measuring the potential of such project ( the feedbacks are pretty good actually) So it's important to start early the mesure people feedbacks
 
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:59:16
Can definitively do that !
Look at the portfolio we already made BTC illustrations

I completely agree with you : holdypawz
there is a lot of debate on the nomination we should use and it could be infinite. 
one :
"let's do something"
is better than a hundred of 
"we should do something"
So I completely respect your initiative and your 
March 1st, 2014 as "Global Switch to mBTC Day" is a great step. Then we will see in the future the next 
If you do a webpage or something celebrating this day I will immediately use systematicaly mBTC
my first step is to update my iOS blockchain wallet to make payment in mBTC
@_date: 2015-05-05 08:01:01
We don't generate any public private key for you yet. You control any wallet you want the way you want it. You input your public key on the system
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:35:07
Since digital assets can be considered as small fraction of bitcoin tagged to be playable in a game why would it be a problem to trade those satoshis ?
@_date: 2014-10-30 20:21:11
This is very interesting I didn't know about this game ! They seem to have a pretty solid plan ! 
They just missing maybe some game footage and artworks.
Anyway we need to discuss with those guys
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:40:02


@_date: 2015-05-04 16:56:39
The tokens are are on the bitcoin blockchain using counterparty layer to handle the digital asset. The only thing you do is linking your public key to the game. We read the blockchain and if the asset is on your public key, can play it in game.
You own the private key we do not hold it for you
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:57:10
The little problem with this is there is no business plan. Even if they are right what advantages will give the coins. How many you are going to issue ? You mention share of the website but if you make them infinite they never gonna increase in price
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:29:52
yes exactly ! It works just like a physical card. We can decide which card is allowed in different kind of games (casual, tournament etc)
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:39:19
As notreddingit say it a new way of envisionning digital property. Paypal also solve payment in a centralized way. So why using bitcoin ?
Decentralised the asset can give a real value to the asset just like a real card game. The openness of the blockchain shows exactly how many are in circulation. We can give value to the asset without being money transmitter since people are free to trade however they want to. They are also free to reuse the asset in another game.
@_date: 2017-02-06 16:24:15


this one have 27 characters with the XX and 5 character for the checksum. I give you 10 BTC bounty if you can generate from vanity and address with 27 arbitrary characters :)
@_date: 2017-02-06 15:31:44
you look skeptical ? About the unspendable address ? It pretty easy to create a valid public key without knowing the private by putting arbitrary letters. 1BURNSogXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXW3ny2Y

Apple is always hard to predict. But the game will use the required official store too buy game assets. When those assets are bought people might trade them freely probably outside the app

Actually it's a Moonga card ! And it will be indeed in a real game  The card will be a digital asset on the blockchain
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:33:07
This is exactly what we are working on. The asset will be used also in our future game 
Imagine you are an artist you could sell your character yourself to the market and a game studio could reuse your character asset in their game. With a smart contract you could settle the terms
@_date: 2017-03-31 14:22:51
it will be soon playable in spells of genesis ! Love making allegory of the blockchain in my game 
@_date: 2015-05-17 11:05:48
We are integrating the blockchain in the game. For now there is one card available  more to come soon 
@_date: 2017-01-26 16:48:48

What qualify an altcoin ? I believe there is no altcoin here. In fact it's like they are coloured bitcoin.
"You know cause its not like the exact same thing could have been accomplished with bitcoin"
Yes and no actually, Yes we are using bitcoin. But Bitcoin itself doesn't allow you to hold something else than a currency. To simplify we are using a small fraction of a bitcoin and we say this is a "red dragon" and  this one "a magic sword". 
This mean you can buy, sale, trade dragons just by sending these tagged bitcoin. You can trade a Dragon for a sword, or a dragon for a 1 BTC easily.
@_date: 2015-08-07 08:34:30
All the game asset are on blockchain. So you have full ownership of your assets. If you purchase a red dragon then it's yours you are free to send it to any wallet. You can trade it for another card for example or sell it for bitcoin. 
Are the token buyers investors in the game?
People participating to the token sale receive BitCrystals bitcrystals is the premium currency of the game. It will allow you to get every asset of the game. Let say someone hold 100% of the BitCrystals then he has access to all game assets and he has the full game economy control. So having a slice of the BitCrystals is like having a slice of the game

Hi Jeremy ! Shaban from EverdreamSoft here.
I guess the author used the word "most creative" means in the arts/entertainment field not meaning the best blockchain project ever. Because of course you guy and other project are doing fantastic  work and there is a lot of very valuable project out there. 
We are just bringing bitcoin to the gaming industry a very important industry for mass adoption.
@_date: 2015-07-28 18:02:31
Yes game cards are counterparty asset this mean player will use bitcoin blockchain to trade and sell cards
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:24:23
Here for example 
@_date: 2015-07-30 07:27:25
Purchase Spells of Genesis cards :)
@_date: 2015-07-29 12:51:33
Answering your question is yes we can do some new content and the content might be close to previous content. As any game company we will continuously try to drive new sales.
There is one thing though if you take example of Magic the Gathering for example (first trading card game ever) they print new cards every 3 months. Some are new and some are close to the ones who existed. But they never reprint the exact same as an older edition. It's important for them the keep a balance between offering game experience and drive a scarcity that will make people invest in the new cards while they are still on the sale market.
But if they where continuously reissuing the same card again and again people wound't buy them. Because first they already own them and second they will lose fate their collection value will increase. At the very beginning of the game there where not many card printed (small market) and even cards very similar to a newer one will have more value because of it's scarcity. And not to say some reached incredible value.
So our policy is to continuously drive new sales by creating new and worthy content. Our ability to keep people excited and buying will have the positive side effect of increasing the value of BitCrystals main vector of card acquisition.
So we won't  re-released, with a new CounterParty token unless a distinctive sign has changed. And we will never mix two assets different asset to give the exact same result.
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:19:33
I would love to see greece embracing bitcoin. But can someone ELI5 to me how Greece gouvernement can use bitcoin ? Since they have no money at all how can they buy Bitcoin to distribute for salary ? They can print paper and give as a retirement income to their people. But they can't print Bitcoin. Other solution is to give IOU papers. Let's say they are bitcoin pegged instead of Euro. In that case bitcoin price will surge and how then could they repay 10x the value ?
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:08:06
Thanks for your honest point of view,
it's true there is always a risk. No risk no fun :)
The only thing we can do is giving guaranties to mitigate this risk. 
In our what we are providing is we are established company who have the experience on delivering products.  It makes a meaningful difference with people who arrive on kickstarter with no track records.
We also kept the most important part set up when we were scheduled on koinify, is to hold bitcoin on multisig wallet. We don't receive funds unless we deliver the important milestones.

Someone is saying on imgur

@_date: 2015-07-29 09:01:57
Each card has it's distribution strategy. Some card are rare and scarce. Those asset are locked and can't be issued anymore. Main difference with any game not on blockchain is you cannot verify if the producer didn't artificially raised the supply since everthing is transparent on the blockchain. Example here :  as you can see the asset is locked and no further issuance can be made
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:20:29
I guess the issue is the same in every product you crowdfund. Or even any game on internet, what guaranty you have that the developers will not reject your purchase so you have to purchase again or close your account. In those case it's not any good strategy to behave like that because you lose your customer trust. The main difference here comparing to other games is the fact everything is on the blockchain and transparent.
In our case we are an established Swiss company developing game since 2010 and our gamer community can attest that we've never did  and will never do something alike.
To summarise we have no incentive to nullify people previous purchases because it will kill the product and our reputation
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:10:05
For sure ! It's actually the case. Last year swiss television came to our office to interview us as paying salaries in BTC. Several days later a politician wrote a mention on how illegal was paying salary with "monkey money" After his motion the federal state did clarify that bitcoin is considered as a currency.  
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:02:44
Haha advertising for the good ! Bitcoin need to be advertised to gamers little steps to change the whole [game] economy
@_date: 2015-07-29 06:46:16
It's sad that the are thinking that. Why do you think it's a pump and dump ?
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:21:58


Correct ! You have true ownership of your digital asset trough the blockchain. Only you control the assets. They are also verifiable if a card is issued 500 units and you own one you are guaranty it's 1 over 500
