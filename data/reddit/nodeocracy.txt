So futures expiring was a non event just like futures starting, death spiral theory, difficulty adjustments, segwit 2x, tether and pretty much everything else? Is non story the only universal truth. Satoshi have you foresaken us to witness a chain of nothing’s whilst getting rich off your chain of blocks. Is this our future? Do we look to the stars and seek reflections of reality? Is time dilation going to screw our blockchain when we chase the stars? I don’t know but I am long as fuck right now.

Do not believe the FUD. Futures are gonna drive the bitcoin price up. It is going to bottom BEFORE futures go live. Wall Street is not dumb, why would they short the most momentum filled, most trending asset of all time? They are going to buy that motherfucker!
Now to destroy some bullshit arguments:
1) Some say Wall Street was buying and pumping bitcoin this week to then short it in futures market
What is wrong with the above?
- the exchanges wouldn’t be able to handle institutional volume
- institutions do NOT have authority in their risk management policies to go and trade on some dick fiddle exchange like kraken, gdax, bitstamp!
- if portfolio managers are buying for personal consumption they would have to declare that motherfucker as a conflict or personal investment for their internal compliance
- if institutions could buy on the dick fiddle exchanges then why the fuck would they need futures
- yes you can go short on the futures but you will blow up like a motherfucker. Can you imagine the margin you will need and what the daily limits will do to you if you are wrong? Go and read about what daily limits did to Ray Dalio in the pork belly markets in the 70s. Hint: he got spit roasted
- it’s the motherfuxkinf year end. Funds want to lock in their returns for the year. Why would they risk their 5-8% return for the year to short bitcoin then show investors their performance for the full year is shit? It’s mid December. Fund managers are looking to go to lap dance land and take their mind off the market, not do their riskiest trade of the year
2) there isn’t a twi. Just buy it the mofo

Step 1) Download all time BTC historical price data (daily)
Step 2) Take natural log of the price in a new column
Step 3) Plot scatter chart of log prices vs days since inception 
Step 4) Add trendline and see formula for trendline 
Step 5) Use formula to extrapolate

Pole part of flag goes from 1000 to 2800. The flag goes from 2800 to 2100. Therefore implied target is 2100 + (2800-1000) = 3900. It's not a clear flag, as the 'pole' itself was a bull flag. But big chance if we break 2800.
