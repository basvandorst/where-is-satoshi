To receive LN payments you need to monitor the blockchain so that you are able to detect cheating attempts and react accordingly. This would be difficult on a device that is often offline, this is why, **for now and by design**, eclair on mobile can not receive or relay payments, only send. This is a self imposed limitation to protect the user.
For a detailed answer, see this quote from our blog post (

You need a LN node URI encoded as a QR code such as this one: 
(The URI being 03933884aaf1d6b108397e5efe5c86bcf2d8ca8d2f700eda99db9214fc2712b134
We will release a Lightning explorer in the next few days, it will list all the available nodes in the network with a QR code to scan

Click on "Channel capacity" in the top section ( The design may be a bit too minimalistic ^_^

As per the [LN specifications]( LN nodes can set a rgb_color and an alias, to "allow intelligence services to give their nodes cool monikers like IRATEMONK and WISTFULTOLL and use the color black." :-)

1) The testnet blockchain is smaller, something like 14GB
3) 
4) you can use this uri: 03933884aaf1d6b108397e5efe5c86bcf2d8ca8d2f700eda99db9214fc2712b134

You need to set a capacity to the channel, and this capacity must be between 1 and 167 milliBtc
If you don't have Testnet bitcoin, you can get some here:  send them to the wallet and you're good to go :)

"Route not found" means that the mobile app could not find channels with enough money to create a route to the merchant. We set up a very basic network of channels for this demo, and one of them got depleted last night. 
We've opened new channels this morning and everything is back to normal.

Sure, you can download the full node version of Eclair, it runs on desktop with a GUI. The latest version is this one:

Hi, Eclair developer here. 
Could you make sure you have installed the last version (0.4.5)? Then start the app, go to Menu &gt; Network Infos, scroll down and click on "Reset Wallet cache". The app will restart and properly sync with electrum. It may take a while!
You can join our Gitter at  if you need support.
