In a **hypothetical** word where the only form of money is Bitcoin, and there is only 21M bitcoins: 
The current population is 1 billion, next year is 2 billion. If you have twice as many people and the exact same amount of money what happens? The per capita or average or whatever you want to call it will decrease leading to deflation.
Do you understand what I mean now?

Wouldn't this lead to the exact same "HODLING" we see today?

Circle does not charge you anything, the 2.9% fee is charged by the Credit Card company.

I'm starting to think all these raising/fundings are bullshit to get some free advertising.

Are we seriously keeping their advertising on the homepage? This is at-least the second time in less than a week I see "10% off Alienware" on the homepage. Their product isn't even that great.

There is the exact same amount of 'satoshis' in 21000000.00000000 and 210000000000.0000 (1 satoshi being the smallest unit). Notice that only the point changed, nothing else.

Even a 10% fee would be acceptable, they need money for hosting, domains and other services, without taking into consideration the time it took to do all the coding. Advertising doesn't really work since it's a very recent site, maybe in a few months they can rely on advertising and remove the fees completely. Just because this is "Bitcoin" doesn't mean everything must have a terribly low profit margin.

Country: Portugal
Buy with credit card - [working]( with Mastercard - MB NET (~~2.9~~ 5.6% fee)
Sell to credit card - [working]( with Mastercard - MB NET (2.9% fee)
Buy from bank account - not available yet
Sell to bank account - not available yet
**EDIT** I was wrong, to buy BTC using MB NET in Portugal there's a 2.9% fee for Mastercard, 1.7% to convert USD-&gt;EUR and 1% bank tax, to a total of 5.6%.

Maybe he was explaining the joke to those unaware?

This is the best alternative I found: Create Armory wallet and save 2-of-4 paper backups in different places. Then I deleted the wallet and made a watch-only to keep an eye on it and in case I need a new address. This is my HODLING wallet, for day-to-day transactions I use Electrum.

No, I just used it as an example to give a better idea of that I mean. Even if you put everything as it is today, only that we have already reached the cap of 21M bitcoins, there would still be deflation due to population growth, leading people to hold instead of spending (like many do today, waiting for the value to increase).
