I've got a great idea...let's create a coin that's value can only be found on an exchange that's never been operational and while we're at it let's fabricate the cover of Forbes Bulgaria so everyone thinks our paid advertisement is anything but a paid advertisement. We can call it...Onecoin.

I'd imagine a lot of coin is tainted from the DN or gambling. If you acquired the coin legally you have nothing to worry about but you could always use coinjoin for shits and giggles.

There's absolutely nothing "stealthy" about btc. It's a public ledger that anyone can see. Sure it's not tied to your personal identity but have you considered your IP address?

"If somebody needs bitcoins for the first time, it's more likely that he will use our [instant exchange service]( and receive cryptocurrency within an hour, rather than register on other exchanges, send KYC docs and wait for a few days before getting the coins. "
It's more likely that they'll use one of the other search results that appear above yours. Perhaps coinmama that yields nearly 1.4btc to your 1.0?
