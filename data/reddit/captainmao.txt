They can make a local greek altcoin, bitdrachma, which will have an exchange rate to BTC, which can then be remitted/traded for EURO, USD and other currencies.
The currency could be grassroot or government backed. Ideally both. Designed with a procyclical monetary* policy in mind while BTC could cover the value store function.
Some basic infrastructure has to be there tho, together with a strong need, a real use case, which is somehow materializing.
*not that I agree with it, but it's to make the scenario more realistic.*

Gavin, you just called him out on personal qualities.
@_date: 2015-06-29 12:23:17
For the middle class financial plebs (P.S. *basically everyone*) 
* who live in other country that have been flirting with a public debt emergency (Italy, Spain) for decades, 
* who don't have a political class to represent their interests (chronic governance crisis)
* and whose economy is now intertwined with that of Germany and Greece more than ever.
These people will find themselved vulnerable to
* european governance failure
* systemical economy failure due to high level of corruption, inefficiency, low competitiveness compared to emerging economies, lower influence/help from the USA due to the cold war ending and a radical redefinition of strategic real politik locations.
If you're part of the economic elite, you can easily dodge a State's default, by leveraging on corruption, privileged access to financial services, insider informations, etc, the same way you can evade taxes and pilot the public machine for advantages now.
The difference now is that P2P finance enables legitimate tools, easily deployable by virtually everybody, with much lower barriers to entry, to achieve protection from a corrupted State or from an economic failure.

You sound ill intentioned.
Volume wise:
February 2013 was the spike of a bubble (250ish $). So definitely a period of big volume, compared to most months.
Still, the volume during that bubble, right before crash,  spiked to 16.7 millions (in dollars). While the volume kept around 1-3 millions during the consolidation phase.
Meanwhile, during last bubble (1200ish $) the volume in the baseline consolidation phase kept around 10 M and grew to 236 millions on the big spike right before the crash.
Right now, we've been cruising at volume levels within a 16-31 M channel.

Very good question...here's my 2 cents.
Bitcoin protocol for medium value (15$ up?) transactions + Bitcoin layer 2 protocols for micropayments, opcodes and lower value payments.
Note that Bitcoin is already mostly used for settlement (that's what Changetip, Coinbase, and many other custodial services do: they shift value around their balances and then settle on the blockchain).
Move this kinds of custodial models to cryptography based schemes so that they become native to bitcoin (opening space for further innovation there) and enjoy increased security.
Optimize for better block propagation, bandwidth, latency, transaction size, etc.
Develop tools to bid for block inclusion (aka fee market)
Test for different blocksizes (maybe a dynamic cap?) find a solution that doesn't alter the economics of the system and it's resistant to attack vectors.

To mine a block takes resources, just like receiving, relaying, verifying and storing a block takes resources too.
If it takes scarce resources, it's not free, therefore it has a cost.
**The marginal cost per block might be "low" but the bigger block the higher the cost, ceteris paribus.**
That's a variable cost (changes with quantity).
Q * P=Variable Cost.
In this case Q, quantity, is determined by how much data we download.
      
Then there's the opportunity cost.




Let's consider the opportunity cost of my bandwidth: 
In our model, I can use my bandwidth to stream HD Netflix which yields me Utility or I can use my bandwidth to run a full node which yields me Utility too...cause I like contributing to the network.
Since bandwidth is a scarce resource, that is it's *budgeted*, I can decide to allocate my bandwidth *either* to Netflix *or* to the bitcoin network.
Therefore, if I can get 10 Utility from Netflix and I decide to allocate my bandwidth to the node, I have a loss of 10: the opportunity cost (the loss of potential gain).
The opportunity cost includes the Utility that one could have been receiving from the best possible task. 
So let's now consider node operator "A".
Bob is a crypto trader who makes money on exchanges &amp; a crypto supporter who also wants to run a full node.
Bob can use his fast internet connection to exploit low latency, put in his orders at just the right time and make money. 
From this, Bob receives utility (pleasure from trading + profit).
If Bob runs the node the connection is not reliable enough and he loses money. *Bob has to budget and allocate.*
Bob's opportunity cost is likely to be higher than mine, since his livelihood depends on it.
Ceteris paribus, Bob's more likely to stop running a node before I do.
This also shows us that each individual has a different opportunity cost.
**The economic cost of bandwidth is the variable cost (data / $) plus the opportunity cost (Netflix vs. Node) plus the fixed cost.**
TLDR: Ceteris paribus, bigger block = higher variable cost, higher opportunity cost, higher fixed cost.

Mining blocks produces externalities.




Just like a plant produce goods ^(output) for a certain cost ^(labor+inputmaterials) but the environment bears a higher cost in terms of pollution.
 
A miner produces a block ^(output) for a certain cost ^(labor+inputmaterials) and gets rewarded, whereas I, node operator, incur in a cost too.
The bigger the block, the higher the cost the miner can impose on me.


In our case, if social costs are not accounted for, price is too low to cover all costs and hence blocksize produced is unnecessarily high.




On top of this, the minining market is *also* a natural oligopoly.
This, my friend, is a problem, a big problem.

Some more random thoughts on the issue:
It's a topic blown way out of proportion to cause stir and outrage 
(everybody is against censorship, everybody is for free speech) and to have people align with other goals (changing bitcoin governance).
The first is a trojan horse, the second is the real goal.
I was here when the events described happened: you could see a huge influx of sockpuppets, literally post gaining +100 upvotes in few minutes.
They all said the same things, they all came from usernames a few weeks old.
What they said was: we are overwhelming majority, you have to change the protocol as soon as possible otherwise bitcoin will crash within six months.
Comments voicing a conservative opionion would be downvoted to -50 in few minutes and autohidden.
This behaviour continued for a while in an on / off manner, not organically.
Meanwhile most of the developers were: 1. skeptical 2. not so keen on changing the protocol immediatly.
Yes, you can call moderation censorship and so on, you can even call a pig a cow.
Maybe if you keep repeating it long enough some people might even start believing you.
I can describe many more occurences but this is not a complete rebuttal since these things have been described ad nauseam and I have to get on with my day.

@_date: 2016-12-15 00:29:54
Not really, it just means that we would have to make our model significantly more complex to account for that. Ceteris Paribus models are really common, they are the foundation of micro and macro economics. 
That's cause they make it easier to isolate and identify proportionality and causation. 
In our case, my preliminary statement was that the mining market is unfortunately subject to negative externalities (that is, costs that are beared by other market partecipants). 
This causes market failure.

75% in 2 of 3 coinkite multi-key vault (ledger  + ledger  + coinkite encrypted pass), safe and easy to set up.
Ledger has some videos that explain how to set these solutions up and also offer a usb stick for a safe linux environment in which to create the private keys.

It can be argued that their values don't allineate with Bitcoin founding values much. Look at a company like CoinKite, for the opposite example.

The algorithms are running the whole verification system, thus making the transactions possible and reliable... it's like a decentralized accounting system of the whole bitcoin economy. It makes sure all the balances are correct and the flow of money is legit. 
It's not wasted computing money, it's necessary to make the system run. 
Instead of having banks and money transmitters do this job, the infrastructure is decentralized and everyone can contribute to it's correct functioning, in exchange for a reward (mining)
Look into "proof of work".

Things have more shades.
Think of what Dropbox gets out of it: decent publicity; great assets in case of current appreciation rate trends / money in case of a static exchange rate.
And then think of what it costs them: some technical tweakings (the barriers to entering the bitcoin economy are low), possible loss of the bitcoin cashflow in case of failure of the btc experiment.
The fact that the initial flow of xbtc is proably modest is not a bad thing per se, cause it limits the company's exposure to risk (it's easier to experiment with an investment on a small contained sample).
Ideally the expected bitcoin flow should be slightly &gt; than the cost of setting it up (which it's pretty low).
As long as they keep good accounting, it's an idea that deserves some debate for sure.
