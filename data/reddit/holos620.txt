What will happen when 1000 people have bitcoin?
Conjectures, conjectures.
@_date: 2014-12-08 15:50:22
Why isn't there a free way to consolidate your wallet. My wallet is full of small transaction from faucets and it cost a fortune in fees to use it.
Also, how do I use eligius to consolidate my wallet? I heard you could do that.
@_date: 2014-12-16 20:42:58
BTC has been going down for months. It'll stop when it'll stop. Nothing more to say about that.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:11:30
It's only a crash for the delusional people who think bitcoins are worth more than $50 bucks at the moment.
@_date: 2014-12-20 20:50:33
lower fees
@_date: 2014-10-04 04:00:12
USA is extremely corrupt, too. Canada, much less so. It happens, but we can clean ourselves.
@_date: 2014-11-26 04:15:22
Didn't they start it, tho?
@_date: 2014-10-04 03:53:01
Yeah right. I'm predicting sub $50. in the next 24 months.
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:03:11
It's not a crash. Price should never have been high in the first place. It just did because people are stupid.
Don't be entitled about what the price should be. This is not a fucking casino.
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:55:35
Don't banks loan out like 4000% of their deposits? 
@_date: 2014-12-30 23:10:40
How do you choose a miner? How do you make custom transactions?
@_date: 2014-12-23 02:22:13
Delusional? Very few were even willing to predict the price, most were humble about having no idea, and didn't think it was important anyways.
You're the one who's delusional.
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:38:01
Yeah, buy all the bitcoins. I'll laugh at you when they're worth less than $50 in a year.
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:58:16
Pew pew pew 2 bits @_date: 2014-10-05 20:01:35


... because they were delusional. You don't understand, forget it.
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:53:02
and magical "high inflation" 
@_date: 2014-12-28 21:58:18
Serioulsy, the style looks amateur at best.
@_date: 2014-11-28 06:05:28
It'll bring us to hell.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:14:51
Yeah, but the people demanding BTCs when it was worth $1000 were delusional. Same for when it was worth 600, and same now as it's priced at 300.
Sure at the moment it's worth 300, but only because it's valued by delusional people. In a few weeks you'll see. 
For fucking sake, take a look at the stupid BTC chart. I've never seen anything as retarded as that. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 03:48:36
Seems like you rationalized the situation to avoid being upset. 
Don't give up, man. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:28:06
The chart looks bearish still.
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:53:09
But you don't do the things you want to do. You're already in a cage, man.
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:17:19
Essentially, BTC is going to be worth less than $50 bucks in a few months.
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:07:45
Or just wait for driverless cars.
@_date: 2014-12-16 01:21:25
Not necessarily.
@_date: 2014-12-19 03:58:37
Collapsing isn't an appropriate term for Bitcoin's decreasing value. The ruble was standing at a higher price point, while bitcoin wasn't. Instead, it jumped there.
Something standing can collapse, something in the air can't.
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:07:49
So was myspace.
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:53:07
What an original name...
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:24:16
Panic phase hasn't started yet. Wait until we break 100USD.
@_date: 2015-01-29 22:59:57
Of course it controls inflation. That's one of the only thing it does...
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:08:57
What about the billions,  did you forget those?
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:04:19
If Hitler is in, I'm in
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:22:53
Why would you buy? Because the price is "low" and you want to make money with this great investment?
@_date: 2015-01-19 00:31:14
So, if I roll 4 head in a row, does it means tail doesn't exist?
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:46:12
But I thought I was going to be rich!? /s
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:06:31
They're afraid of deflation more than anything. In deflation,  the poor get richer,  and the rich get poorer.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:52:21
It can go either way. If you find bitcoins useful, then use them. If you want to get rich, then don't buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-12-19 02:34:32
To be honest, it doesn't look very good.
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:18:45
It wouldn't have changed anything. If they see it, they can confiscate it.
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:49:25
There you go, you said it yourself. Poor people spend all of their money to buy stuff, while rich people have enough to save. In deflation, the general price level of goods and services decreases, advantaging those of have to spend most of their income buying goods and services.
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:48:14
Lol this guy is unreal. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:18:29
They don't have to explain to you why they believe your property could have been used in a crime, tough. They just take it. After they take it, they are also entitled to keep it.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:42:20
Recover? Why are we entitled to a price higher than what it is now? What would be wrong if the price stabilized here?
@_date: 2015-01-31 02:57:54
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:51:46
That's not how market works.
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:36:57
Simply holding an asset is a legitimate use.
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:57:02
Isn't that a proof cloud mining is real and not a scam?
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:48:50
To the moon! And beyond!
@_date: 2015-01-02 13:17:32
So, bitcoin won't make it mainstream because the price has been floundering at around 350$?
I'm convinced /s
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:49:18
The price will go up! I'm bullish! /wave_arms
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:00:50
Or if you use your bitcoins to buy things, which is what you're supposed to do.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:20:05
That's how price discovery happens.
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:13:15
Price going down doesn't mean bitcoin has a problem. It just means that people, through the exchanges, are just trying to find what the coins are worth.
It doesn't make a good environment to use bitcoins in, but it won't always be like that, price will stabilizes eventually.
@_date: 2016-01-02 03:15:41
Bitcoin can be overvalued, too.
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:09:02
People don't need to go to blockchain.info phishing sites to get their bitcoins stolen, the real site does the job well enough already.
@_date: 2014-12-20 03:17:05
It's funny because their 5min chart shows an ascending wedge, which is bearish.
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:03:16
The problem isn't that it wasn't high or that it isn't falling a lot. It's just that it isn't falling from a well established price point.  
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:36:54
What makes you think the price is low?
@_date: 2015-07-02 01:44:18
It sounded like he was selling bicoins...
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:11:19
If connection speed prevents fair competition, isn't that utterly stupid? It doesn't sound like something difficult to fix either.
@_date: 2015-07-25 21:50:29
It looks like a thumb with a face drawn on it.
@_date: 2015-04-23 18:05:16
"i lost a lot of money, so now I'm salty"
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:22:38
I sold all my coins at $488. Couldn't be happier.
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:48:05
Omg we crashed into the moon!
@_date: 2015-10-10 00:42:09
I'm almost there too. Need 0.08 more. It takes a while just with faucets...
@_date: 2015-11-09 04:42:21
Clearly a head and shoulder pattern. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 18:09:00
They will want to ban it for sure. People will sometimes donate to streamers instead of subscribing, and twitch gets paid when people subscribes to channels.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:55:34
What happens when you download something illegal and your isp gets pinned for it?
@_date: 2015-02-27 04:20:10
Someone knows something imo and is taking advantage of it.
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:12:26
You had to hodl! I sold mine at 700 :P
