Posting a post changes the possible outcomes of voting to, isn't posting and allowing voting a form of controlling voting?

Money is a pyramid schemes, so if you want to make more money sharing is bad, but if you want your currency to have value, pushing out the user base is good! so up to you.

I would toss my chip credits into this.

February orders should cancel at this point, if you think bitcoin will spike, use the refund to buy bitcoin. A LS wont break even if it starts mining after 2013-11-01, and it would break even due too value rising, it would have been better to buy at that point.

There likely was one but market said om nom nom. Still waiting to see if the market will eat this one too.

If you know the word, there is only a small amount of possible variations.

Yep look:  back to normal.

It doesn't need to be sponsored, it seems more likely a group is trying to drive the cost down, or artificially affect the market.

Install sizes have always only accounted for the package size. And the notice you are thinking of is posted on the sights where you download the client. Am I missing something here?

yes, and I'll look into that.
@_date: 2013-03-04 16:22:59
So an estimated 4.5 mill difficulty in july? A 30 gh/s BFL unit for 700$ could possibly pay for itself in 3 months if a BTC stays above 30$USD? Am I reading everything right?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:33:40
Because people pulled buys and sells at the same time or because there is low demand to buy at market price and high demand to sell at market price? What exactly are you saying indicates manipulation?
@_date: 2013-03-04 21:16:27
lol yes that. I did my calculations on 45mill, but typed it totally wrong. x.x
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:58:39
Why would the DDoS hit forums though, it's illogical isn't it? Forums are where panic spreads.
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:13:40
Your difficulty rating is way off. A super rough and likely outdated estimate for difficulty at the start of July is 50mill. And account for the possibility of bit coin crashing back down again.

well as long as the graph is mathematically factual its fine. the issue is that people don't know how to read. And he's not showing a graph of bit coins, hes showing stricture of a bubble, which BTC did hit in small scale.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:37:40
isn't a wallet just the keys and adress? so multiple backups over time is redundant?

You can contact ebay, but i do not know if they can help you. ebay has fairly clear policies here.

We don't ostracize companies who make bad choices as a society now. And those bad choices constitute economic gain as profit is the motivator to cut corners. Why would a smaller government change human behavior? We have seen what no regulation means to business in american history, it hasn't been pretty. Why will it be different now?

And by 800$ to spend I mean I only have 800$ to my name.

Where does the belief that government is a bad thing come from? Is this a belief that the Madisonian Dilemma is unsolvable? I am no fan of some aspects of my current government but I am under no delusions that pure anarchy or pure free market won't trample human rights in pursuit of profits.

Its all about scale.

 You can check here. If you are buying from BFL you wont get them until around July, hopefully, that's why I said July.
@_date: 2013-03-12 00:48:33
Barter and exchange isn't illegal in the US, buying controlled substances are. If anything if bitcoin transactions are highly tied to illegal use law enforcement will merely just use it as an easy way to have an indicator of possible illegal behaviors. For it to get legislated it will require a poorly educated congressperson and public hysteria.

BFL's hitting the grid after everything else though, there is a debatable profit margin. I am trying to get data so I can guess how fast I can recoup my costs and avoid my SO killing me for spending the cash.

@_date: 2013-04-10 19:16:35
This makes most sense so far
@_date: 2013-09-19 18:08:27
I shall likely be doing this, but it does not hold BFL accountable. Using american consumer protection laws means companies face 16k$ in fines per infraction. Companies need to know that they can't just screw people over for profit.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:38:23
Libertarianism isn't anarchy though, at least I thought. They are closer to anti federalists?
