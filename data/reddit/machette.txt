What would happen if someone sent 10,000,000 transactions/day back and forth (without trans fee), would this slow down legitimate transactions?

Issuing a warning is not enough. 
I believe current bitcoin community has an above average IQ and is pretty good at risk assessment. When we go mainstream, we can't expect an average joe to maneuver the web like we do.
needs a list of NON-ANONYMOUS exchanges. Domain/Company Name/CEO/Years in business/Telephone
Anyone sending coins to basement exchanges is an idiot, sure at one point in time they were necessery but not today.

We need to let Dorian know about the donation NOW so he can follow it in real time.

I am so glad all the media is picking up the 'crisis strategy' as real :) Gox reputation is now completely gone, even if they re-enable withdrawals they will never be back in business

But small transactions can be sent without a fee, how can they be ignored ?
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:12:44
How do you trade alt currencies for BTC ???

Mtgox customers will get a share of their money/coins back. The same can not be said for mcxnow or any other anonymous exchange if it goes under.
