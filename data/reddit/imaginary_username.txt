Most people do care about whether their currency's value is quickly dwindling to zero. I'll very highly doubt the pure, I'll balk-at-nothing ideological holdouts are numerous enough to rebuild the entire infrastructure from scratch. Without the exchanges, payment processors and Localbitcoin, tx received after the fork on minority are nothing but Monopoly money - actually, Monopoly money can still be used to wipe your ass with, so it's even worse.

Ah, so like petertodd's backroom deals with F2Pool. Got it.

That is a false statement under _any definition_. Not core devs (80% against, 20% for if you just include the self-appointed Big Five, lower if you include more), not miners (the Chinese mines who control ~60% just spoke in support of increase), not users/potential users, not payment processors, not onramps/offramps, not exchanges, not merchants.

Having 51% soft-enforce a 1MB limit (aka choosing to not mine &gt;1M blocks) is still very different from having a hard-coded limit. At any point in the future when most miners change their minds, the chain will easily and almost invisibly be flipped over. 
"What if they choose to simply orphan &gt;1M blocks somebody else mines?"
Orphaning each and every &gt;1MB block is still really hard, considering said 51% are not gonna jump ship all at once in a coordinated attack. If you have 20% follow the new fork initially and 5% of the resistance jump ship every day, they will never succeed in orphaning attacks unless the majority are entirely malicious (in a coordinated way) instead of just chasing profit. In that case, we have an entirely new problem to worry about.
I can see miners choosing not to mine large blocks just as they do now with &lt;&lt;1MB blocks, but again it's implausible that they will purposely orphan large blocks on purpose if it's not hard coded.

Some form of zero conf is needed today, right now, right here, for the ecosystem to thrive and not die off. Maybe one day in the future when Lightning is working and well, we can make the network more robust by pushing full RBF. Today, doing so simply results in people either abandoning bitcoin or moving to o centralized off-chain, which is far worse than the imperfections of zero conf on-chain.
I agree that FSS RBF is probably a good thing, but that is not what Peter got F2Pool to implement at first. F2pool realized the mistake they made, by themselves (probably with community input) and backtracked. It does not reduce the potential harm that Peter could have caused within even a few days.
In other words, people who claim to be visionaries and do things for "long term" need to realize that short term user behavior - such as adoption - _matters_. An outside, impartial observer can easily tell you that bitcoin could very easily die off, become irrelevant, or centralized solutions (say, a Coinbase ecosystem) can take over. When that happens, arguing about long term robustness becomes hopelessly academic.
@_date: 2015-06-05 22:16:12
Yup, you're right in that if you solely do transactions and get in/out of bitcoin-space as quickly as possible, you don't pay for that part. You only pay for debasement if you hold any coin whether to pay, from payments, or to hodl. Similar to fiat inflation, it's a wealth tax, except in bitcoin it's solely used for securing/enabling transactions instead of an array of other activities.
@_date: 2015-06-06 10:28:12
Well, my completely unfounded guess is that it's indicated by the recent (a few months' worth) "stabilization" of price around $220~$240, and also the very slow and controlled nature of the decline that precedes it. Market panics usually don't look like that, but rather like jumping off a cliff. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:44:31
The problem with such a malicious attack when exchanges and payment processors back the minority is, of course, that it essentially wrecks all the exchanges just to force them to conform to miners' ideology. Loss of general confidence in bitcoin, widespread adoption never comes again, price goes to $5, etc. I can see a government doing this to kill bitcoins, but to suggest rational miners doing this instead of just jumping ship is absurd.
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:11:02
Exactly, and you know what the greatest threat to Bitcoin is? I hate centralization as much as the next person, I hate the idea that it might not be ideologically pure without RBF, I hate that my laptop might not be able to run a full node using DSL, and I hate handing nodes over to merchants. 
But these are not the greatest threats to Bitcoin. The greatest threat we have now is irrelevance, the "Beanie-Babies" future, a future that can very well happen if adoption is stalled or reversed. Ending up holding a bunch of very secure coins that nobody but 200,000 people will ever care about, as money is slowly drained out of our pockets to compensate miners? That is the future I lose sleep over, that is the greatest threat. 
The small blockers and the RBF folks seems to willfully ignore this future, and it's a shame not many people are calling them out.

It's a very tired argument. Lightning will work on blocks much smaller than 8GB, but it still flat out _won't_ scale on 1MB. Instead of "play money for a few geeks", it'll just be "play money with Lightning, now for a few more geeks".

Just came across this thread as a spender =D Have never bought bitcoins on Purse before, but I don't think there's a huge risk; still, you need to accept the risks of: 
- bitcoin tanking while the stuff is delivered (and the spender waits before releasing)
- That Purse might flag you. 
I'd say start small and making your way to bigger purchases, like in any other system where you slowly build trust, is prolly the best approach.
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:27:30
Yep, buy coffee, leave within 10 minutes, doublespend. it's especially troublesome for small online merchants and person-to-person transactions. As of right now if you doublespend it's a race that the second tx has a hard time winning - hence inconvenient for the doublespender. But if RBF is implemented you can bump your fee by 0.0001 BTC and the merchant will be SOL every time.
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:29:31
Sure it's "dead" for transferring 100 BTC. Buying a car. Lending money. All those critical applications, 0-conf was "already dead". "I simply didn't present a big enough target yet", sure. 
_But "not presenting a big enough target" is the whole point of how 0-conf became useful in the first place_. Nobody was under any friggin' illusion that they can buy a house by 0-conf. The point is that it's _inconvenient_ for an attacker to do it for trivial amounts, and with a little bit of friction added in there somewhere (say, a coffee shop handles a limited tx at a time), it's something _good enough_. 
Heck, I just settled a couple small debts _yesterday_ over the Pacific Ocean using Bitcoin. "Did you get it?" "I got it!" in 5 seconds. If I have to pull the "Uhh... let's wait 10-30 minutes because you guys only met me once" would have killed the concept for them.
Analogy: Sure, locking your front door is good policy no matter where you're at. Not locking your door at all times is _already dead_, in your words. But some days, when I move furniture or out there to chase down my escaped cat, I feel okay leaving the door unlocked for a few minutes. It's possible, but highly unlikely, that people are gonna just break in during that time. 
Implementing full RBF today will be akin to actively sending a marauding gang of thugs, and they'll break in every house that has an unlocked door for however short amounts of time. And then the Devs will point and laugh "I _told you_ not to do 0-confs!"
A sane person can accept the risk of highly infrequent break-ins; if that becomes more often, maybe that person then invests in locking the door more often and more carefully. Great. But a sane person will not tolerate the mayor sending roving gangs of thugs to break into his house at the first sight of unlocked doors. Instead of investing in bigger locks, he's more likely to conclude that "this town sucks" and move on.
Gosh, I know you guys are good guys and care about the system being ironclad from all sides. But you gotta get out, take a walk in the real world sometimes, see how this is _actually_ being used sometimes, before killing a usecase.

I'll totally advocate for a max_blocksize that's n*median(size of last 26280 blocks, or 6 months); it both has enough inertia to not respond to spam (spamming for many months straight will be really, really costly) and miner-independent enough to not be abused by big pools. Unfortunately people are shouting down each other too much with rigid increases and complete status-quo, BIP100 is probably the best dynamic system we're gonna get.

There is no possible way 1MB blocks can scale to all humans.

We don't actually need to care why - they can be honestly believing in what the preach (I _really_ hope so), they can be doing this for Blockstream, they can be compromised by the CIA for all we know. We should only debate this on the merits of the proposals, the counter-arguments on table, and how the community (users, miners, merchants, infrastructure providers) receives them - and so far I don't think the maxblocksize-conservatives are being terribly convincing.
If we do a witch-hunt and start caring about whether some core devs are secretly NSA agents and such, then Bitcoin as a decentralized currency is doomed. You don't want to repeat the Fed "a dozen old men in a smoke-filled room" mistake again.

Sorry, please allow me to narrow the scope. What stops a miner from colluding with a double spender, who can very well be themselves, with or without higher fees?

"Your proposal is bad because we don't like it. It'll in fact always be bad as long as someone don't like it" - pretty much what this piece says.
A 100% consensus is impossible given a sufficiently large crowd. It's plainly, obviously absurd except to the most naive of observers. Heck, give me a million people, I'll _guarantee_ you there are a couple of them who think murder shouldn't be a crime.
So... What he suggests is, therefore, is that there will be no change until the end of time, or until bitcoin fails? 
The piece also seems to be based on the absurd belief that an (incompatible) fork of supermajority vs minority will create massive confusion. This, despite what everyone knows already: the minority fork will become an altcoin, basically worthless monopoly money in no time if all the exchanges and payment processors jump. I do not see how a hard fork with a supermajority of miners, supermajority of nodes, all payment processors and all exchanges _can_ fail. There won't be confusion, there won't even be a confidence crisis, it'll just be old-fork loyalists quietly and begrudgingly joining the new fork for their coins to remain useful.

"Bitcoin users and traders will not care for ideological aspects, so they will not drive the price down. "
This is... I'm sorry, kind of delusional. Users and holders DO care about future prospects and reliability of the system. A group of malicious miners coming in and disabling _all_ exchanges for a day is exactly the kind of thing that kills confidence, probably worse than Mt. Gox. 
People expect miners to act in rational self-interest, the every-miner-for-their-own structure is what prevents 51% attacks in the first place. People do not expect miners to coordinate and assault other bitcoin entities. To suggest that people will just have figurative guns be pointed at their heads by a supposedly purely profit-driven player without losing confidence is... implausible.
Heck, if so many miners want the old chain so badly, why don't they erect their own exchanges and see if people will go there?

The problem is, look at how hard it is to fork the chain now, already. When bitcoin grows a few times bigger than now, it will be impossible to reach a consensus then - perhaps we'll then fork by crisis ("Bitcoin is gonna die tomorrow! Gavin says 500MB and has code, let's do that not because we've thought it through well, but because we have no other choice!") - it'll be the polar opposite of a well-debated, well-thought-out fork, which is what the larger-block proponents are trying to do now.

Regardless of blocksize you'll probably get mining centralization. It's just an unfortunate side effect of ASICs being expensive and constantly advancing, in addition to cheap electricity being concentrated in not that many places (and cheaper when bought in bulk). Bandwidth and disk considerations for miners are not nearly as important as the sheer difficulty. Maybe one day, when ASICs are commodified and advancing slowly, while solar (most distributed power source we got) becomes really cheap...

Right, that's assuming the miners are all (or mostly) doing it for profit - and this is true if we have one of the following scenarios:
1. Bitcoin ecosystem is fairly small and self-contained, so not much malicious outside power is interested in destroying it. Miners are all plain, boring self-interest maximizers. I believe this is where we are at right now. The great powers are not terribly worried about our disruption; they feel rather secure due to our small size. They are, rather, very curious about where we're going.
2. Bitcoin ecosystem (and hence mining that comes with it) becomes a worldwide, universal standard, a beast bigger than _any_ centralized power can handle. It then truly becomes invincible. In this case, it's hopeless for any (irrational) attacker to achieve majority without having the _a majority of wealthholders_ agree with him/her.
We're currently at  but it's not a stable place. We _are_ at the mercy of entities that are much larger than our market cap, that might very well act irrationally or for reasons far removed from profit. The only way I can see for us to be truly, stably safe thanks to how miner incentives work (as you describe) is for us to get to  as soon as possible.

@_date: 2015-06-20 20:15:46
I think you got it backwards, my friend. What good is having 100,000 nodes if the blocks are so small, everyone has to keep their transaction offchain in coinbase anyway? We're not "appeasing corporations" (especially not greenaddress, big blocks reduce their utility); it's about getting to more users, and making sure most of the users don't go off-chain and be hopelessly, irreversibly centralized. And only with more users can we possibly make a dent on how the world works. Aside from going to the moon (heh), don't we all want bitcoin to change the world, however improbable that might sound? 
That aside, I'm piggybacking a node on my workstation... it's got a 10T array and a nice little 100M connection, so that should last a while. Idk, I think dedicating a machine just to run a node is not the way to do it, piggybacking it to a pre-existing desktop is probably a lot more convenient.

Well... 1MB won't even work as a settlement layer for widespread adoption. We have 7 billion people on the planet, 1MB doesn't even provide 1/10th the capacity for 1 transaction per person _per year_. 
Unless they intend it to be a "settlement for big banks", I don't see how 1MB can scale in any shape or form. Even the Lightning guys said they need 133MB blocks to eventually scale their solution to the entire world.

Who do you think are buying all those 3600 BTC / day from miners to keep the price high?


Well then, how much will _you_ pay to keep it reasonably secure, per your own definition? My ideal is to have large blocks so that a lot of people can pay a little each. Say, in the future when node HDDs are cheaper (for nodes), a 400tps system where everyone pays 0.001BTC adds up to ~240 BTC / block, or roughly ten times the BTC equivalent of hashpower for the network than the block award - inflation subsidy - affords us now. What are _you_ willing to pay for the security of the network? 


This is again a straw man. 8MB maxblocksize does not mean 8MB blocks every block tomorrow, self-interested miners will adjust to maximize profit, and that equation often favors small blocks. An attackers that aims to flood the network and has the hashpower to do it can probably already do so via a 51% attack (or 30%, or 40%, depends on whose essay you read). 


Thanks, you too.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:41:52
Well, we'll all like to have 133MB blocks + Lightning... now that _does_ scale to 7 billion people. For today's scaling needs though, 8MB can be done tomorrow, while Lightning exists... in concept only. If forced to choose between an imperfect solution that exists today and a non-existent solution that someone promises "will exist next year", I'd go with the former every time. 
"Why do we need to hurry?"
You know, because if shit hits the fan for _any_ of the fiat currencies tomorrow and a couple million people start using Bitcoin, we're toast, and the loss of confidence will be irreversible. Lightning is fine and dandy if it exists today. It doesn't. Show me a release schedule tomorrow and I'll reverse my stance.

Yes, of course you can still own gold, just like regardless of its scale and relevance, you can always own bitcoins, or even start your own chain anytime. 
But acceptance matters, liquidity matters, the fact that you can't just go out there and buy a pizza with gold _matters_. Gold is now rendered to a niche, and it's purchasing power _more_ volatile than dollars, precisely because there's no acceptance and nothing is priced in gold anymore. Something that's more volatile than fiat isn't very useful as a safe haven, except under the most extreme of circumstances - say, mass confiscation, which doesn't happen that often compared to more subtle forms of fiat abuse.
If you want bitcoin to become a great store of value, you'll also want it to be widely circulated and accepted for commerce; the moment you have things _priced_ in BTC, and people's wages negotiated in BTC, is the moment your safe haven is complete.
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:31:58
Alternatively, just embrace bitcoin: Use it for payments in your life as much as possible, and repurchase as needed.

You can look at it two ways: Said debasement (Bitcoin price could have been even higher without subsidy!!!111!!!) is the cost of _enabling_ transactions on the network in the first place, but is unrelated to the _marginal_ cost of each tx. So you could say that "We all paid ~$34500 in fees for all the coffee and drugs and hookers and amazon gift cards bought within that hour", but cannot say that you actually "paid $2.5 in fees for that particular cup of coffee".

Also, this is a cautionary story about how important general merchant adoption is - to hell with those who says "hurr durr it's digital gold nobody should use it to buy coffee or groceries". For a safe haven to be useful, people need to have confidence that it's universally accepted, and _they can buy goods and services to survive_.

While i usually argue that not everyone needs to run a node, if blocksize grows way, way too big too quickly, you have a real danger of node centralization. A bitcoin where only amazon and google can run nodes defeats the whole decentralization idea. I'd argue that it's entirely unnecessary for everyone to be able to run a node on anything - the whole "but muh netbook node" argument is misguided - but a determined, middle-class citizen should be able to run a node if he/she wants, just from disposable income.

Seriously, people completely forget the miners can enforce soft limits if they want to. Raising the hard limit merely _allows_ them more freedom to adjust the soft limit as they please; due to limits in block propagation it's unlikely that any (self-interested) miner will produce 1GB blocks even if that's the hard limit we have. 1GB-block-producers will lose out so much on block propagation (their own bandwidth don't even matter because it's limited by the node network) they're gonna lose a LOT of money.

If the exchanges agree among themselves, though, on going one fork and not the other, the mining pools can mine all they want, but whatever they mined/voided will be worthless. The exchanges can just ignore whatever the pools are doing as long as a significant - can be small - number of miners went to the new fork to secure it. 
In other words: Double spending? Where will they double-spend it to without an offramp? Miners attack coins on the original chain? If the exchanges all ditched that chain, why would they care?
When you have only miners competing against each other, the longest chain wins; but in the case of an eco-system wide fork that involves more players than miners, it's no longer the case. The chain with the _biggest economy_ wins.

This is essentially what Peter Todd is pushing for: Right now 0-conf businesses could use centralized solutions (offchain) or nonexistent solutions (lightning), but they don't _have to_; 0-conf on-chain is "good enough". Peter actively broke this to kill off coffee shops who would rather not sign up for a centralized solution. And in doing so, directly hurt adoption at an early stage of Bitcoin's development as an economic tool, in addition to making centralization worse. 
If this - a crime way, way worse than Gavin going around lobbying businesses to "support" him in words, or Mike musing on Twitter about "benevolent dictatorship" without actually doing anything - doesn't cause an uproar in the community, I don't know what will. He's done, he needs to go.

Not exactly disputing that "this is not a very good way of doing business"... But that's my point, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. That 0-conf isn't exactly broken today is _good enough_, considering that the adoption from convenience far outweighs some risk in the future which everyone now sees coming (actually, we gotta thank for alerting us - an actually attacker will look like him, except not in the open), and will change as incentives change anyway.

You actually put it in pretty intriguing angle - the bitcoin mining as a power "storage" description is awesome. Except we don't need to buy back coal power at night to mine, the idea is that _someone else_ is mining on the other side of the world. 
The major weakness here, of course, is that I'm making the big assumption: that ASICs will be commoditized and become very cheap relative to electricity in the near future. If that never happens, nobody can possibly afford to leave their machines idle when sun's down.
Solar does consume outside resource! Aside from manufacturing the panels, solar consumes land - lots of land - it's just that the land often happens to be surface that's otherwise useless (costs are minimal). 
@_date: 2015-05-18 17:22:23
As ASICs get commoditized only electricity cost over a stretched out time matters - the fact that solar is intermittent (as you described) won't matter as long as it's cheap over, say, a few weeks. The operator can simply reduce hashing activity when power is low. Leaving machines idle has its costs, but when electricity is the majority cost it matters less.

Well... I think you got current (in amperes) and power (in watts) mixed up in your math. Power = Voltage * Current, not the other way around. Also there's no "watts per hour", a watt is already 1 _joule_ per hour.
In any case, let's actually make use of those numbers:
Let's, very roughly, say you lose 20% power in voltage conversion from that 50w panel, so that's 40w/$100. $100 will buy you 500kWh of energy delivered (energy = power * time), or 500,000Wh (disregarding inflation). In other words, to break even you'll want your panel to last you 500,000Wh/50W = 10,000 hours, or about 420 days' worth of continuous sunshine. Discount it by 50% (doesn't work at night), we get 840 days. Further assume you live in, say, Germany, so the performance even during the day is quartered (often cloudy, performance deteriorates towards dawn and dusk). That will give us 3360 days till break-even with coal, or about 9 years.
Having a panel that lasts more than 9 years is fairly realistic, and we're not even taking inflation into account. That panel is cheaper than your grid power as long as you keep it more than 9 years.

This "dynamic" option is incredibly flawed as 21% of hashpower can bring it down rapidly. It's _not_ "market driven": It's tyranny of the minority. We might all think that a 51% attack is fairly hard to pull off, imagine what happens when we can have 21% attack the ecosystem and arbitrarily ratchet up fees, _even against the majority of hashpower_. One, just _one_ big pool can pull this off (think F2Pool and their shenanigans). 
It's unimaginable that the major economic actors will go with this.

Unfortunately, a currency that is small and open will _never_ be able to resist attacks on its purchasing power. If your currency is not spread far and wide with a huge cap and immense infrastructure behind it, you don't get to choose between convenience and security; you get neither.


From the currency perspective (instead of technical), the NSA is actually _less_ of a threat to Bitcoin than technologically inferior but wealthier entities. For example, Satoshi (with 1m BTC) and Exxon Mobil (~$350b in cap, $40b in cash-on-hand) are both bigger threats.

If you do a survey of a random sample of bitcoin holders, I guarantee you that growing the userbase to eventually encompass significant swaths of the economy (some can wait longer than others) _is_ the goal; it might even be debatable whether that goal is equal to, or higher, than the sanctity of complete decentralization. Being permissionless, IMO, is definitely higher than both of these goals, but to say that "growing is not a goal of bitcoin" is either dishonest, or applying sheer dev-elitism over people who actually hold and use bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:44:08
You could see quite a bit of 8MB blocks if someone decides to launch a (now 8x more expensive!) spam attack, but that is unlikely to be sustained for too long - and your 8MB blocks will help everyone use bitcoin more smoothly when that happens, unlike, well, what we've been seeing. In reality, as long as dust relay rules don't change you're likely to see &lt;1MB blocks most of the time. 
When we have sustained, fee-paying non-dust tx filling up 8MB blocks your holding will most likely have increased so much in value you can get yourself a couple 6TB drives, run them in RAID 0 for the block chain and leave them there for a while. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 21:38:14
Adding to that:


The "stress test" was done by a small party with limited resources, only willing to "saturate" the channel with 0.0001- 0.0002 / tx fees. What we have seen is that a simple saturation in tx will inconvenience, but not destroy bitcoin. The whole "spam attack" was easily circumvented by raising your fee to an insignificant .0002 / tx, or 4~6 cents. We have _not_ seen what happens when legit users actually try to outbid each others for limited blockspace, aka an actual "fee market" as intended. 
TL;DR The stress test didn't really demonstrate anything important, just that the network can survive meaningless spam, that's all.

About de-prioritizing Tor: It's a stretch to call it "goodbye to privacy", as Tor exits are _not banned_. It's making a call when resources are stressed. It's an ugly implementation - something much smarter, algorithm-based should be available - but it's far from "goodbye to privacy".

There are two main, non-lunatic objections from the small-block camp to that statement: 
- 75% is not consensus, a 25% leftover can still be manipulated/cause confusion/damage etc. 
I posted a [thread]( discussing it. I respect the people bringing up this argument, although i disagree with them because I think an economic majority, once achieved, is unstoppable. 
- The big blockers are mindless mobs and are manipulated by "rabble rousers" who are out there to destroy bitcoin, we should not allow that to happen even with a supermajority.
People thinking this way can scarcely be reasoned with, because they chose to ignore completely the core values of Bitcoin.

The needs of law enforcement: Well, I think the general stance of bitcoiners is "Law enforcement should not be touching my money anyway!" If someone committed a crime, jail him, apply a big fine on him, use the $5-wrench-method to make him cough it up, but the ultimate control of one's money must stay with that person; if he wishes to die with his private key, so be it.

You know... If Core merges BIP100 tomorrow, in a week, or in a month, the XT movement will be extinguished _right there_. And I'm okay with that, I'll switch back and ask others to do the same. This coming from a person who agrees mostly with Mike Hearn's vision.
That one move will reflect the ability for the Core team to make compromises, and that is very good for the future of Bitcoin.

It's interesting that it seems like many miners are now on the side of BIP100 (even in its incomplete form), the proposal that gives them more power, while economic players seem to prefer BIP101, the proposal that allows more commerce. 
Ultimately though, miners do not have the power to "create" whatever hard-fork they wish; they'll _have to_ follow the economic majority if they want to preserve purchasing power. They do have the power to destroy Bitcoin though - by messing up SPV via longest chain, and persistent 51% double-spend on a chain they don't like. It'll be foolhardy and destroy themselves in the process, but technically speaking they _can_ do it.

Only a very small contingent of big-block supporters are militant against layer-1 or 2 initiatives (most prominent being LN), and we do realize that those are _needed_ for bitcoin to conquer the world. The problem is, you don't want those to be the exclusive channels for people to rely on. They don't even exist yet ("Thunder" centralized prototype doesn't count), and we already have numerous concerns both technical and philosophical about them. Hopefully those will be addressed soon, but staking the future of bitcoin as a currency on yet-to-exist solutions is irresponsible. 
The big block advocates are advocating that people should have reasonable access to all layers after the dust settles. Precisely for the reasons you mentioned, most people will always gravitate towards a cheaper compromise (say, a functional LN), even if the price difference is small. Big-blockers envision a future where buying coffee on LN costs $0.01 in fees while doing on chain costs $0.1~$0.5 (a very rough example): higher, but still accessible, so most people will choose LN. This is markedly different from a 1MB future, where one can see needing to pay $5, $10 or $20 per tx to access the chain: it'll be _exclusively_ for settlement.

Yup, many of the devs seem to believe that we should have a bitcoin that is decentralized, secure, yet not very widely adopted or used. The problem is, they fail to see (or choose not to see) how a currency works: A currency that is not widely adopted or used is _neither decentralized, nor secure, nor even valuable_. 
And despite much illusion to the contrary, that's actually where we are today. We are _not at all_ resistant censorship, non-technical (currency-based, e.g. huge shorting) , 51%, or any other attack you can name, simply because we're way too small. The Chinese Communist Government can kill us _tomorrow_ by a wide variety of means. It's not a matter of choice, whatever technical risks there are, we _must_ take it, for we cannot have real security unless we have size.

Thank you Rusty, that is more fair than other attempts to summarize arguments from both sides that I've seen. 
Neither side is out there to "destroy bitcoin": It's just that one side (big blockers) are more concerned with Bitcoin's survival as a currency, and the other side (small blockers) are more concerned with the Bitcoin Network's level of decentralization. Debates should be about how much one should weigh each of those (and how much impact there actually will be), not pointing fingers and say "hurr durr you guys have ulterior motives".

@_date: 2015-08-12 00:06:02
Glad you agree! There are definitely less pleasant people who would just keep shouting without acknowledging anything. With that said:
On home connections: "Bandwidth" in this case has two constraints. If you're talking about instantaneous bandwidth, even with a 2Mb/s link you can download 8MB in 30 seconds, I don't think that is a significant problem for node operators who desire full validation (... and that is presumably the only selfish reason, aside from "help the network" altruism, why anyone would want a node to begin with). I don't really think we should be taking very low bandwidth (dialup, 512k etc.) into account, the debate quickly gets to "we need 100k blocks to accommodate everyone" ludicruous territories. 
If you're talking about a bandwidth cap - and it has been brought up repeatedly, it can be addressed in a twofold manner. 
1. Sustained 8MB blocks add up to ~35GB/month (download). Not exactly trivial, but if you have a connection that limits to, say, 70GB cap per month, that is _awfully_ low, I had that in a dorm 10 years ago. I don't see the download cap as a credible issue anywhere where Netflix exists, for example. 
2. Upload is a little more tricky: Without a limit one can be uploading to a _LOT_ of peers without breaking a sweat, and you'll bust whatever limit you have before you know it. Which is why you can... limit the number of connections. Yup. Google it, it's easy, and I expect almost one-click solutions to crop up as bigger blocks become more prevalent. ~~In fact it kinda puzzles me how nobody has written a simple tool to do this already,~~ (Edit: I think it's already a one-liner in console. We should promote that option more.) it'll greatly aid node proliferation. Limiting connections just limits your "support" of the network but doesn't really harm it - it should also help with latency problems that can inconvenience you if instantaneous bandwidth problem during new block propagation is annoying. 
The selfish miner problem has two parts too - one of them is from "block withholding" which is blocksize agnostic, and can already be done today. The other part, selective transmission to peers, is the part that actually _is_ a problem, but to say that it's the primary problem we have in miner centralization is kind of preposterous. The centralization we see today is almost _entirely_ the result of availability of cheap electricity, economy of scale, and centralization of rig production. That last point can't get any worse (we have exactly _one_ ASIC producer that's competitive) and cannot get better if the price stagnates or drops, just look at the mass demise of ASIC producers during the drop throughout 2014. I would actually argue that, in this sense, limiting the utility (and hence price) of bitcoin is _worse_ for decentralization than the selfish mining problem from bigger blocks.

I don't either, but if I see an allegation, I go and check from a diversity of sources - including the code itself - first. I don't just ask "what else is in 0.11? I don't know, let's just go around accusing Core producers of slyly pushing for changes we don't know before I check it out." They got consensus, you say? Not _my_ consensus for sure!

And why would those huge amounts of capital move themselves into a currency that is not already secure (see above), not already have a large cap (remember, they haven't moved in yet), and don't have a wide array of ways to be used (read: liquidated)? 
There has never been a popular currency in all of human history that existed as a limited-player settlement medium _before_ it was a payment medium. Not seashells, not gold, not silver, not USD. The closest we have is the proposed IMF SDR, but that's not really here yet, and if adopted will be a highly coordinated and centralized effort.

Right now no such major fork exists yet, nor is the alternate client ready for deployment, so nothing.
If and when such a forking client is actually deployed, you can support it in a small way by mining and voting with your hashpower (mining on a non-Core node). If the fork is scheduled (reaches supermajority of hashpower), you then sit tight, keep mining and wait for the dust to settle. Not spending your coins until the dust settles is the  way to keep your coins intact.

I think the point Mike was making is not that P2SH undermines _all_ fully validating nodes, of course if you kept up with the soft fork you're perfectly fine. The problem he describes is: Claiming that "in the event of a soft fork, you're gonna be alright even if you're not upgrading" is dishonest. Because your old node no longer follows the new, stricter consensus validation protocol, you're essentially reduced to SPV in security, relying on other nodes not to cheat you into not following consensus. Your entire purpose of running a full node is therefore defeated. 
Essentially, in the event of a hard fork, your noncompliant node is forked off entirely. In a soft fork, in a way that you can be oblivious about, you become SPV and your reasons for running a full node is defeated.

The forking client has set 75% as the threshold. The only time a single pool (_not_ a single miner) has gone over was GHash.io, and there were indeed alleged transaction censorship  that happened back then... but pools being pools, miners quickly saw that and abandoned GHash (they are now in the low single-digits), everyone learned a useful lesson there. 
Among the biggest pools right now, Bitfury, 21 inc., Huobi(?) and KnC are private, and probably more dangerous - but also has more self-interest in preserving Bitcoin as they actually invested their own money in hashing. Antpool, F2Pool, Eligius, BW, BTCChina and Slush are all open: it's unknown how much hashing power their owners have, but they have less potential to do damage over a long period of time as they can be abandoned. (Especially Antpool, which seemed to grow big solely on the fact that their _very_ competitive miners point to their own pool by default). 
@_date: 2015-08-20 20:51:38
So much FUD. I'm tired of arguing against them, so I'll just copypasta: 
The "transaction blocking" or "Tor blocking" "blacklisting" as variously claimed by FUD-spreader (or confused people) is an anti-DDoS measure that **only activates when connections are saturated, i.e. when you're attacked and your node will go dark anyway if you don't do something**. Which one will you like, de-prioritizing Tor nodes and hobble along, or just go down in the spirit of fairness?
To be fair the implementation is a bit ham-fisted and not really that effective (can be circumvented with minor effort), but to call it "blacklisting" is just dishonest. If you read Mike's reply originally posted by (below), XT actually includes some bugfixes that improve your node's ability to survive non-responding peers and still relax tx.
The "de-anonymizing" part is where XT fetches a list of Tor exit nodes for the de-prioritization described above (from the Tor project itself!). Allegedly it "exposes what your node is doing". But in fact: 
1. As Mike repeatedly pointed out, you already broadcast to the world, loud and clear, that you run a Bitcoin node at your place by putting it on the internet and relaying tx. Fetching a list from the Tor project doesn't change that.
2. If you're behind a proxy, the fetching doesn't happen. Nope, it doesn't destroy your efforts to stay private.
3. You can manually disable the whole de-prioritization list thing (and hence stop fetching) in a single line if you really, really hate it.

@_date: 2015-08-25 03:32:22
There are several aspects of Bitcoin that needs "decentralization", and I think growth will actually improve them, not harm. 
Looking narrowly: If we only look at one aspect - network decentralization - under a narrow assumption: That adoption remains exactly the same as today, the amount of stakeholders and commerce remains frozen, then indeed bigger (filled) blocks will lead to a worse centralization. That I can see, and is what your guys have been warning all along. 
However, in reality adoption is not staying static, number of stakeholders and amount of commerce is not staying static, and are all in fact heavily affected by expectations resulting from the blocksize limit. Decentralization of the following, as I see it, has the potential to be improved by increased adoption that's made possible by higher tps: 
- Decentralization of stakeholders, in other words more people will hold Bitcoin. This is probably the most important part: Bitcoin is not just a network, it's also currency, it's _money_. There are many ways a hostile entity can attack Bitcoin's _purchasing power_ without touching the network at all... and the more stakeholders we have, the more resilient Bitcoin is against currency attacks. Indeed, from a currency perspective, Bitcoin's purchasing power cannot be truly safe until it takes over the world.
- Decentralization of commerce, both in entities and type. If Bitcoin is stuck being a DNM currency, it can be _easily_ quashed by destroying exchanges. Allow more commerce to take place in more diverse places - and eventually, perhaps hyperbitcoinizing smaller economies - you also ensure that the original use (DNM) will continue to survive and serve as base value for Bitcoin. Governments didn't allow cash because cash was hard to ban; they allow cash because ordinary people doing legit businessess _vastly_ outnumber illegitimate use.
- Decentralization of hardware. Right now as bitcoin stays small, we're already seeing the crappy side-effects of a stagnant market: We only have one competitive retail-miner company left, and the pools get increasingly centralized not because of any problems with network, but because of _economies of scale_. Let Bitcoin grow bigger, and small-timers will become more viable again because the distribution of cheap/free energy is ultimately decentralized.
- Decentralization of network(!) will ultimately come from the decentralization of stakeholders. People want to protect their stakes, both in BTC holdings and commercial interest, from malicious forces; at the end, it might turn out that this alone is sufficient motivation for people to run nodes and miners, instead of profit. Right now we have 6000 nodes, many of them practically volunteers with very little stake; if a hostile government wants to, they _can_ in fact coordinate an assault on most of them. It might not be the end to Bitcoin per se, but it'll be the end to its purchasing power. 6000 volunteers are _very_ different from 6000 merchants, or even small nations, heavily invested in the ecosystem and ready to defend it tooth and nails. 
In short, I don't think we should trade a path to much greater resilience (as described above), that's only possible with greater adoption made possible by increasing blocksize, for a short-term, narrowly-defined network "decentralization" that will not even be relevant if other aspects above are compromised. That, and it's highly doubtful that 8MB/16MB blocks are even gonna hurt network decentralization that much in the short term. My two cents.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:53:46
All that "test" proved is that the network can handle a flood of spam without breaking down... which we already knew. The fee was too low to simulate an actual "fee market" that the small-blockers wanted, it pretty much just inconvenienced users of less sophisticated wallets, and showed nothing of value for either side.

The general stance of some of the more active devs on this sub, as far as I can remember: 
**For near-term increase:**
Gavin Andresen: Currently favors "8MB very soon, then automatic double every two years till it hits 8GB in distant future", aka BIP101. Also finds Jeff Garzik's BIP100 (see below) acceptable.
Mike Hearn: Agrees with Gavin on BIP101. Currently working on implementing the increase in an alternative client, Bitcoin XT, to provide full node operators with a real choice. 
Jeff Garzik: Favors "8MB after miner negotiation and a delay period before enforcement, stepping up/down on maxblocksize possible after with similar miner voting, absolute upper limit for the hard fork at 32MB", aka BIP100. Also proposed "2MB immediately and nothing further", aka BIP102, as an emergency stopgap in case adoption takes off, fees ratchet up and the sudden ecosystem meltdown puts further growth in danger.
**For *very* conservative increase:**
Pieter Wuille: "First increase scheduled at 2017 (to ~1.04MB, I believe), then automatic increase some 17% per year till 2GB in distant future", aka "Draft BIP103" (nominally un-numbered).
Luke-jr: Finds Pieter's proposal an acceptable compromise, though generally favors smaller blocks, occasionally expressing views that even 1MB blocks are too big.
**Against increase until "something X is implemented":**
Adam Back: Proposed "Extension blocks", aka a sidechain-lite, that allows migration to bigger blocks with only a soft fork. Also favors only migrating when sidechain tech is ready, against hard-forks in general.
**Against increase in near-to-medium term future:**
Gregory Maxwell: Against hard-forks in general, also against bigger blocks in the short-to-medium term future.
Mark Friedenbach: Against hard-forks in general, also against bigger blocks in the short-to-medium term future.
**Staying neutral:**
Wladimir J. van der Lann (Core lead dev): "You guys wake me up when you have a consensus, not gonna merge anything till then" (not actual words)

@_date: 2015-08-10 00:36:02
1. The client-in-question inherits all the blocks before the hardfork. Your pre-fork coins are entirely safe. 
2. The fork-in-question is designed to not activate unless a supermajority of miners agree via their blocks. It's an imperfect system that relies on self-interested miners, who presumably want to see bitcoin's utility increase and hence make their own judgement. This admittedly ignores a lot of confounding factors, but if it fails to achieve supermajority, nothing happens. 
3. If the fork happens, it's likely that some die-hards will cling onto the minority (by mining and/or by economic power) fork for whatever reason, however... 
4. The fork that is not followed by the vast majority of exchanges and payment processors is extremely likely to be wiped out via price depression. A chain whose coins can't be used for goods and services is worthless.
5. If you wait till the dust settles to spend your coins, you'll be alright.

The central problem of BIP100, as I can see it and reaffirmed by jgarzik (that this is indeed the case, there's no "alternative interpretation"), is that it gives a _minority_ or miners the power to arbitrarily bring down the maxblocksize. 
A majority of miners have always had the power to change a lot of things in Bitcoin, the biggest of them is, of course, which chain to build on (hence which transactions are valid). But never in Bitcoin's history has a _minority_ of miners have power over anyone else. The only power individual miners have is the soft-limit that they choose for themselves. 
Giving power to the 21% minority opens a huge can of worms and a wide-open avenue for attackers to devastate the bitcoin economy for short-term gain.

No, read again really carefully. The new maxblocksize for the next cycle is set to the _minimum_ that 80% accepts. In other words, if it's 4MB for the current cycle: if 79% vote for 8MB, 2% vote for 3MB, 19% vote for 2MB, new maxblocksize is 3MB.

I can see a way for Charlie to incentivize Alice by saying "You unfortunately have to pay y1 = x for the first tx, but if you do business through me again I'll allow for some discount y2 &lt; y1.", but Alice will need to have a way to negotiate that with Charlie.

The last point Mike made is in fact that most powerful one: _Bitcoin is already not safe today, and you'll need to be really delusional to think otherwise_. And the reason we're not safe is because we're way, way too small.
We simply have not been attacked by a sufficiently powerful entity yet - the banks are mostly curious, the governments are either refusing to do anything with us, or even cautiously welcome. _No large institutions have been openly hostile against Bitcoin yet_. And the moment any of them - say, the Russian government, the Chinese communist party, heck, even Canada, becomes aggressive, we're done. And we will fail not because of any blocksize-related flaw in Bitcoin, but because of either fundamental vulnerabilities (51%), or absolutely non-technical vectors (exchange manipulation, coordinated censorship, destruction of infrastructure in general). _We are not safe today, we'll never be safe as long as we stay small, we have no choice but to take the risk and grow big_.

Let's see... 2013:
If you're talking about mining centralization, there's nothing fundamentally different in 2013 that prevents any of the large entities from creating a large mining pool. If anything, it'll be _easier_, as hashrate was lower; Bitmain already existed, the Chinese government just need to seize it.
If you're talking about non-technical risks - market-based threats to bitcoin as a currency/purchasing power, a single asshole Mark  was able to deal a big blow back in 2013. Definitely not better than today.

I suspect those users on low bandwidth are already using light clients (SPV, Electrum etc). Those sacrifice a little on _full_ validation but is still a perfectly usable way to use bitcoin without trusting keys to a third party.


Wait, are we talking about the same thing here? What I was talking about is 70GB usage per _month_. Surely the 30-40MB you're talking about is instantaneous (30-40Mb/second)? If you have a 30-40MB total cap per month that's a lot worse than dialup...

Lightning won't be ready for a while though. If a truly malicious attacker 20x as well funded as this one pulls one again in 3 months, we're probably screwed. 
Raising the maxblocksize does have drawbacks and risks of centralization as you repeatedly mentioned, but I don't think the benefits of small blocks to the network is worth the very clear and present danger of DoS attacks.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:42:05
I was talking about a "spam attack" dedicated to DoS(malicious)/stress test(well-intentioned?) the network and inconvenience legit transactions. They can push blocks to 7.5MB... and it'll have exactly zero effect, nada, none, on how fast legit tx are confirmed. Once they actually push the size to 8MB, legit transactions which estimate fee and can use CPFP to raise it (more and more wallets are capable of that these days) will then go to a small "acceptable" fee for them, say, 0.0002 BTC / average tx as it is today. It is at that point, when the spam attack actually is doing what it aims to do, that it becomes expensive. 
TL;DR Spam attack that doesn't fill blocks don't actually achieve what it wants, spam that does is 8x more expensive. 
If you're talking about normal transactions that attempts to pay low fee and still get included, well... that's what the big blocks are supposed to do, keep tx fee low most of the time.

Craigslist goes out of its way to not handle money for its listers... but that's besides the point. 
Actually, I don't think doublespending is going to be a significant issue for face-to-face Craigslist, because in meatspace you face a very real danger of the other part chasing you down and beating you up with a baseball bat. Imagine if you double spend, the next block comes in 60 seconds and the vendor finds about your doublespend in the block. A pissed vendor within direct line of sight is not something most hackers want to face. 
Shapeshift, on the other hand... since they hit all the criteria I listed that makes them vulnerable, payment channels is probably a good idea. I personally think they should just wait for at least 1conf like everyone else in the exchange business - nobody's gonna be pissed for being required to wait 10 minutes, but either will work.
After all the debate I'm actually pretty open to RBF (even the full variant) now; not because I suddenly think zero-conf is worthless and should be damned to hell, but rather because any zero-conf use that's not broken today (missing any of my listed criteria) will not be broken by RBF of any kind. RBF is limited to the time before the next block comes, after all.

The vast majority of value that people transferred into Bitcoin is long-term speculation that its utility is enormous, and that economy based on it will grow. However, the bitcoin network currently faces a problem: the network produces one block every 10 minutes, and the block is hard-limited to never exceed 1MB. That translates to about ~3.5 transactions per second, which does not bode well for scaling (even with some innovations currently being hammered out, such as the Lightning Network). 
The developers who contribute to the bitcoin project are divided: One side, the more well-known among which are and propose some form of stepping up (either automatic and scheduled like halvings, or miner-voted) over time. Another group of devs, the more well-known among them being and (he proposed a _very, very_ conservative alternative) are against such a change, stating that it will result in high bandwidth use and loss of decentralization. Lots of discussion were had about how bad/not-so-bad the impact actually was, and how to weigh it against the danger of stunting growth and/or centralizing _somewhere else_, but no agreement was reached.
Many actors in the space (exchanges, payment processors, big pool operators) have stated, in a scattershot way over time, that they support _some form_ of maxblocksize increase; however, due to opposition from the latter group, no such increase has been merged into the Core code, for a long time.
In his frustration, Mike Hearn proposed (and later did) to include code for lifting the blocksize in his alternative client based on Core, Bitcoin-XT. It is still being tested, and is supposed to only go into effect if a supermajority of miner adopts it. 
The small-blockers are furious that Mike went around them, and drama ensued - just search "blocksize" in this sub to get a glimpse.

And to be fair, it's not exactly impossible to do investigations via the blockchain even if anonymizing methods are used. You might not be able to prove ownership due to the method I described, but you sure as hell can prove that _a transaction has taken place_. If you get one side of the tx to cough up information about the other side, you can unambiguously _prove_ that a transaction has taken place. Note that this is not like gold, where you can tell someone owns a hunk of gold in his house but cannot prove that a tx has taken place if he melts it. In Bitcoin it's the reverse.

If you remove the profit motivation from mining you pretty much destroy Bitcoin, especially when PoW is involved: History has proven, time again, that greed (ideally long term, but sometimes short term) is the only reliable thing.
Decentralization of mining isn't necessarily a doomed cause, though. I personally think that it'll eventually get better as the price rises and we have more participation, because the distribution of cheap or free (heating needs) power is decentralized around the world - there's only so much free electricity you can get from corrupt Chinese coal-power.

I second. The small blocks dev have numerous opposition to bigger blocksizes ideologically, but as far as I can see "being a paid shill" is not one of them - and nor does it matter, because they're making some (not all) valid arguments that we (bigger block proponents) just disagree in importance and whether it's worth compromising growth. The "they're all bought by Blockstream to stunt Bitcoin" conspiracy theorists need to give it a rest already.
@_date: 2015-08-18 07:16:53


XT is not going to actually allow 1MB blocks until 2 weeks after the activation condition (75% hashpower) is reached, so no such proof is available before activation. 
It's a whole other thing if a miner is ideologically-driven; but my impression is that most miners are simply (long-term) profit-driven - Bitcoin's security depends on that assumption. And a profit-driven miner is unlikely to follow such a spoof; for spoofing in this case risks a gross destruction of the ecosystem in the case of chaos (as opposed to the other two scenarios, whether Core wins or XT wins overwhelmingly, where Bitcoin carries on without too much disruption), and destroying the purchasing power of Bitcoin destroys a miner's entire income. 
I can speculate that mass-spoofing (30%++) when XT has &lt;50% hashrate could lead to some BTC-denominated profit by tricking competition out of the winning chain, but whether this is worth the great chance of chaos and/or accidentally causing XT to win is very debatable. You'll need enough miners to 1) Muster a huge hashrate share to spoof, 2) Be sure that the "Core faithfuls" won't jump ship in that two weeks, 3) If returning to Core within two weeks, that the XT camp won't see the shenanigans and switch back to Core, eliminating the spoofing advantage, and 4) Be very sure that purchasing power won't crash to the floor to eat up all the spoofing bounties, to pull this off. 
And in any case, it's highly unlikely that the miner supermajority can be achieved before the big economic actors declare their support - miners will follow whichever way that maximizes their profit _and_ purchasing power. So attempt to sabotage from the miner side is kinda moot in any case.

Well see, the point of bitcoins being instant (or 10 minutes for 1conf, or an hour for 6conf, depending on whom you ask) is that fiat money transfer is generally not instant, and takes several days. When you are "buying" Bitcoin, you exchange fiat for Bitcoin... and the fiat part gets you. Bitcoin only fulfills its promise if you stay within its realm, i.e. doing transactions in just Bitcoin, no fiat.

If we just put our hands up and say "well, how do we know if voting means they'll follow through? They can change last minute?" then we'll _never_ have a hard fork.

On top of that: Without a good price there's no security _even in the short term_, as block rewards' purchasing power is directly proportional to the price. The system's less secure if there's less hashpower, and hence less reliable for whatever "immutable ledger" creative uses they can think of.

As I see it, there are two possibilities:

2) Bitcoin fails, adoption stays stagnant - realistically, that'll probably mean "slowly fade into irrelevance" - or goes down. In that case the blocksize debate is moot anyway.

[BIP101 by gavinandresen: 8MB next year, defined time for increases over 20+ years up to 8GB](
[BIP102 by jgarzik: 2MB, nothing else. Failsafe in case of consensus failure, and adoption causes imminent meltdown of ecosystem. To be ignored if other more long-term solutions are adopted](

If you run all other clients ("SPV", or "simplified payment verification"), you alone has the power to spend your coins, but you depend on someone else to do your verification when receiving. As pretty much all nodes are "honest", you're probably fine. 
If you run core, you're a "node"; in addition to having the power to spend your own coins, you verify your own payments (along with other people's payments) because you actually host the blockchain (ledger) instead of depending on other people. The drawback is that the ledger can be pretty big (closing in on 50GB now, may get much larger in the future) and transmitting blocks takes up quite a bit of bandwidth (mainly upload). You also contribute to the robustness of the network when you run Core. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:32:16

...hence some merchants will choose to take the risk of zero-conf, and allow their customers to use it? We actually agree here.

The risk, under most scenarios, is likely to be still way lower than CC transactions anyway.

75% of the hashing power adopting the new fork will most likely imply that most of the economic activity is moving to the new fork. Mining on the lesser fork will collapse as the price collapses (due to lack of economic activity). 
Even today, the whole reason why all the altcoins combined have such a tiny cap is because you can't friggin' spend them anywhere nor do anything useful with them.

They don't have to make a profit, they're either trying to liquidate their gift cards (mTurk from a lot of countries, Coinstar, miscellaneous Amazon-gift-card-dispensing venues, even some LBC traders) or trying to buy Bitcoin without going through AML/KYC venues (Darknet frequents?). For these people, it's either take a loss in value (for the convenience of getting bitcoins), or nothing at all.

There was a scramble to give more user choice in increasing tx fee, which was good; and then there's the fact that the attacker didn't try hard enough. Bumping fee from 0.0001 to 0.0002 is hardly even an annoyance. A real life congestion will increase tx fee all the way to the "pain point", past which entire sections of use-cases will just wither and die. 
We need a spammer that can actually commit many millions in USD to test that scenario.  
@_date: 2015-07-12 08:31:22
I seriously don't see why people hate the spamfilter so much. While people might hate it for ideological reasons (no tx should _ever_ be discriminated against!!11), giving people who run nodes additional choices on policy can only be a good thing. Bitcoin is the sum of nodes and miners (layer 0) and the ecosystem (layer 1+), after all. 
That said, spam in its perfect, malicious form is most likely unblockable; only "creative use" spam, due to their use cases constraining their pattern, can possibly be blocked by a filter.

It's fascinating how people still don't get that Bitcoin is a currency, and economic activity _matters_ for a currency. Nope, SPV has no immediate power in how the network behaves. But yes, they have all the power - perhaps, given the number of people and economic activity, more than miners and nodes, actually - in shaping how the currency (and hence the underlying network) behaves. 
Consider a world in which the Core devs somehow managed to find a way to block all lightweight / SPV clients forever, and all the nodes somehow formed a consensus ("stop the leechers!") to adopt this mechanism. Further consider that all offchain transactions are also somehow banned. (they have zero says too, no?)
You know what happens to bitcoin? People like you and luke-jr will probably say "nothing, perhaps it'll be better". 
But it won't be. Without economic activity and the future prospects of it that drives long-term speculation, BTC price will crash, and something else - centralized or not - will take its place. The ecosystem - whether the miners and nodes like it or not - are then strapped to a time machine, going all the way back to 2010, before bitcoinj and Electrum were started. Simply by using the currency and injecting value/economic activity into the system, you vote with your net worth. _That is your power._

There are very immoral acts which this community generally frowns upon - your straw man example of human trafficking being one of them. There are very grey-zone activities generally considered moral (or amoral - no difference either way) but nevertheless illegal (and are "crimes"), such as smoking weed, paying for hookers, Greeks getting their own money the hell out of a bankrupt country. Bitcoin is great for helping those people. And then there are things that are _not even technically illegal_ (unlike speeding!), such as hookers buying their own ads, that are nevertheless made impossible because people in power arbitrarily don't like them. Bitcoin is _awesome_ for them.

If the fork fulfills the necessary prerequisites (say, 80% support), it's hard to see how the lesser fork won't be quickly rendered irrelevant because of the lack of economic activity.

A corollary to this is that the security model that Bitcoin is using right now (pay miners via coin creation; essentially inflation) will gradually cease to work as block rewards halve; we _have to_ secure it by tx fee then, which means that we _have to_ grow (in terms of ecosystem) for bitcoin to last into the future.

I think the point is that your own wallet is anonymous... and especially so if you have a HD wallet (or two), so they can't easily link your wallet address to a known-identity tx to trace your identity. If you transfer from your Coinbase account to some unknown dude who then uses it to sell to backpage, surely you can't be held accountable for it. And Coinbase can't (easily) tell whether it's your own anonymous wallet or some unknown dude.

That's actually quite different from what I said. _Some_ Core devs are tooth-and-nails opposed to larger blocks. Some others (tend to be a superset of the previous group, but not always) are opposed to the idea of a hard fork without "100% consensus": essentially "I oppose you because these guys over here oppose you, and sorting it out will be ugly". The previous group is arguing policy/protocol. The latter group is arguing against a _procedure of change_ in protocol. The two groups overlap a lot but are not the same.
Theymos is using an extreme version of the latter argument ("hard forks are _so bad_, even an attempt or promotion of an attempt is very bad") to censor, scroll down on this thread to see it.

Actually you're probably a lot better off with physical goods, because physical good takes a much longer time to ship and arrive, during which your BTC will be in escrow the whole time (You release your BTC immediately in the case of a gift card, no?) 
A scammer face significant risk (of card cancellation) during that shipping and arrival time. The item can turn around during shipping or can be clawed back if already shipped, and the scammer gets no coins in addition to whatever criminal risk he/she already faces. Compared to relatively-more-honest buyers (say, mTurkers), scammers are a lot more inclined to buy instant-exchange items like gift cards.

A limit high enough to force other miners off the network (because of non-propagation and non-verification to other miners' nodes) will also be high enough to orphan the miner's own blocks though (similarly), decreasing profit. It is difficult to see how rational miners will choose to keep other miners off the network - an indirect and uncertain "benefit" -  while immediately increasing their own orphan rate, a direct disincentive.

For the per tx fee a user is willing to pay, the attacker will have to spend 8x for an 8mb block than 1mb block. Say, the tx raises to $10/tx - and let's say this is the absolute maximum users will pay before bitcoin just _dies_. (I don't think I'm too far off, actually) On an 8mb block, an attacker will have to spend a whopping 21 million dollars per day to flood it at $10/tx. On an 1mb block... the attacker can either: 
1) spend just $2.6million and get the exact same effect; or
2) spend the same $21 million to jack the tx fee to _$40_.
It's not exactly trivial, just because we're dealing with 0.0001 fees now. It's very relevant even if fees go up a lot, negating your "8x nothing is nothing" argument.

You're _completely_ right, of course - I meant a "secure" design, as advocated by the small blockers, as opposed to actual security. In reality, a currency rendered irrelevant are even worse, it is _unsafe, not decentralized, and not valuable_.

IIRC Mycelium and Electrum have more sophisticated nodes ("Electrum servers" etc.) that stores your balance, transactions etc. in ready-to-access form, so everything's a lot more snappy. Breadwallet and Bitcoin Wallet ("Schildbach's wallet", Android) both query a collection of regular nodes instead of specialized nodes, which means that they'll have to download relevant parts of the blockchain instead of having snappy access to the pre-indexed form. This has both disadvantages (mainly: balance display/refreshing is less snappy, regular nodes are not really designed with SPV in mind) and advantages (mainly they're immune to server failures, since there are way more full nodes than Electrum/Mycelium servers).

Thought experiment: I have 10000 addresses. I "spam" by sending 0.0002 fee txs between them, each carrying 1 BTC (or better yet, some randomized amount), forever, generating huge backlog of txs. Even better, the spam tx fee can be dynamic, capped by some number the spammer is willing to bear.
I don't see a way for spam filters to ever be able to distinguish this from normal tx. 
A well-funded, reasonably well-executed spam attack cannot be solved by filters, it can only be solved by pricing them out - either by larger blocks or higher average tx fee. This attack (or stress test?) is probably not nearly as well-funded as a truly devastation attack should be, but it is a warning shot.

I personally think blocks need to be way bigger than they currently are - I support BIP 100 and BIP 101 - but accommodating _everything_ is not terribly feasible.

Fees can be increasing because of one of two things:

2) Spammer artificially jacking up tx fees, crowd out all the legit users and devastate ecosystem. Infrastructure (merchant, exchanges, creative applications, wallets, servers for SPV) in tatters, spammer leaves, tx fee drops again but nobody cares, bitcoin done for.
You seem to ignore the very possible scenario of 2) created by a well-funded, malicious attacker.

1MB of spam (matching majority tx fee) on 1MB blocks clog the network. 1MB spam on 8MB blocks do... exactly nothing, nodes slightly inconvenienced, spam fails. The spammer _need_ 8MB of spam on 8MB blocks for a successful attack.


When the ecosystem dies because it's so easy to spam and jack up tx price, neither temporary nor permanent issues are of any concern. 


Users have a yet unknown (untested) pain threshold on Tx fee, beyond which they'll simply abandon Bitcoin. We don't know what the threshold is, but we do know the threshold does not change with blocksize. A user that won't pay above $10/tx on 1MB blocks is not gonna just say "gee, I guess we have 8mb blocks now, better abandon bitcoin when fee is $2 instead of $10!".

Do you know how much of the (relatively stable) value currently invested in bitcoin is long-term speculation that it'll take over large swaths of the economy? Let me give you a hint; _virtually all of it_. Everyone's betting that bitcoin will eventually be big. Give the impression that it'll remain small, and the whole thing collapses. Your "store of value" then becomes no better than any other speculation vehicle, including but not limited to gold and Picasso paintings. Heck, at least I can make jewelry out of gold, and the government actually needs to use guns and make a ruckus to take my gold.

Nope, not the Coinbase wallet. You see, cryptographically (mathematically) speaking, your "wallet" is in the control of whoever controls/memorizes/has down in paper a string of characters called the "private key". Think of it as an insanely difficult to crack "password" to your money. 
With Coinbase, that key is controlled by, well, Coinbase; you never see that key, and hence you must ask Coinbase for permission every time you move your money. If one day Coinbase decides they don't like you, they rescind that control, and... poof goes your money (coins), just like traditional banks. 
With an "independent" wallet, YOU control the key, and YOU alone (aside from people who get to see that key if you're not careful... *snicker*) decides where the money goes. 
Numerous easy-to-use solutions exist where you control the key on your device and nobody else. For starters (on mobile), Breadwallet (iOS), Mycelium (Android) both offer excellent usability without compromising your key to the service provider. On a desktop, Electrum offers a completely open solution. Try them out! 
**Remember to make backups (each solution nags you to complete backups), because there's no way to retrieve your money if you lost your private key. Reveal the "public address so that people can send you money; NEVER, EVER reveal the private key to anyone but yourself and your trusted devices.

Sending is pretty much always safe with or without a full node.

It really depends on the level of economic adoption of the fork (or not). Remember how a currency works: _A currency that is not accepted for goods and services is worthless_.
A overwhelming majority among the economic actors (payment processors, exchanges, node-running merchants) is actually good enough - self-interested miners will follow what's good for them. Fragmentation of the "core database", however you define that, will happen, but _people will not care about the fork with no economic value_, just like how nobody cares about the hundreds of altcoins today no matter their technical features. 
Obviously the converse can happen too (the alternate fork can fail in the exact same way). But to say we need 100% consensus from everyone for everything or "it'll be massively damaging" is nothing but FUD.

Of course at the current market cap, there is _no way_ to price out DDoS from a large state government; it's just impossible no matter how you look at it.

We'll tackle that problem in the future when storage and bandwidth become cheaper, and bitcoin actually becomes big enough to attract attention from world powers.

Often overlooked in calculations: 1MB blocks are vulnerable to DDos from random assholes with too much money to burn, _even if_ tx fees rise. Up till some absurdly high (for now) level.
Think about the math above. Filling up a day's worth of blocks with 0.0001 fee tx now costs ~26 BTC. Even if fee rises to 0.01 BTC, 100x, $2.5 _per transaction_, the attack would have still costed 2600 BTC/day, or $650,000/day. Definitely not something the good folks at coinwallet.eu can shell out to "stress test", but well within range of what a malicious bank or hedge funds can throw at you without blinking. 
Will people abandon bitcoin when it reaches $2.5 / tx in fee? Nobody knows, but a huge part of the ecosystem will just _die_. It's not coffee anymore, selling pretty much anything low-to-medium-value to consumers except drugs will just be... unfeasible. As people run, so the price follows, attacks become easier, etc. 
8MB blocks? Well, with $5.2 million/day, the math suddenly becomes quite a bit more painful for the attacker. Even a fairly big bank might find it difficult to hand-wave that figure as trivial on their books, the attack will be very hard to do stealthily by anyone other than the big state governments.
Extrapolate for higher bitcoin value (from possible price increase due to increased adoption), even bigger blocks, etc. You simply can't withstand an attack from guys with big sticks without growing yourself.

I see what you mean, your concern is more about "spam" in general (that aims to inflate the chain) rather than a "spam attack" (that aims to inconvenience/inflate fee for transactions). For ease of identifying which one you're more concerned with, let's call the former "fill to 7.9MB" (needs very low fee to pull off) instead of "fill to 8MB" (needs substantial fee to pull off).  
That is a legit concern - and spam should definitely not be allowed to inflate the chain arbitrarily, which is why the fork proposal still includes a cap rather than the no-cap-at-all approach some seem to advocate. However, there are three points that bigger-block advocates have to address the concern:
1. Within the constraints of the currently proposed fork, it's rather hard to see what's the motivation for anyone (except perhaps a malicious miner who control a lot of hashpower, but that's a whole other discussion) to do the "7.9MB attack". It doesn't do any immediate damage to the bitcoin network, and if the goal is to do long-term bloating to discourage node operation, then...
2. ...it's not terribly effective with 7.9MB blocks. 7.9MB for every block will add up to about 400GB a year. A 4TB WD Red is now $165 on Newegg, that's &gt;8 years of sustained spam to inconvenience full node operators at less than $2/month each.
3. Even if not terribly effective, it's still an attack vector, yes. But the point of the big-block proponents has always been achieving a compromise: that making legit tx more convenient (spam "8MB" attacks harder to pull off) is more important than staving off the 7.9MB "bloat blockchain" attack. Low-fee and reliable legit tx, important for growth of the ecosystem, weighs far more than the possibility of someone inconveniencing node operators by adding 400GB/year.
@_date: 2015-08-05 21:11:37
I'll take a crack. 
1. Most bitcoiners hope to "dump" in the far, far distant future when Bitcoin takes over the world. In the same vein, your parents buying stocks or mutual funds are also "pumping and dumping" since they do plan to cash out in 30-40 years.
2. If 40 years from now we don't have widespread gigabit, there are more important problems to worry about than Bitcoin adoption. Also: Bitcoin can scale far more than the level 0 blockchain, as upcoming overlay technologies can provide a couple orders of magnitude improvement in accessibility (Lightning Network, for example).
3. It's as anonymous as you want to be. Use HD wallet, don't reuse address, your anonymity immediately jumps a couple orders of magnitude, and it's free. Pay a tiny cost and do a few CoinJoins (and your coins are freshly anonymous, no amount of computing power can trace to you with any certainty. For the bandwidth issue, see  (for full nodes). You don't even need a full node to use bitcoin, and using a lite protocol (say, Electrum) means you can totally do okay via dialup.

5. See points above.
6. See points above.

8. See  Also, Bitcoin has numerous other selling points, the most prominent being that your transactions are immutable without the need to trust a third party. Also: You don't have to ask for permission to use it, eliminating regulatory control if you stay purely in Bitcoin space.

Every single one of them actually want blocksize increases (with a couple possible exceptions), they just want to do that on a different schedule/mechanism that Gavin suggested.

A much bigger initial jump than Pieter's (say, 3MB) followed by his very conservative growth estimates would seem to be the reasonable "conservative" stance to take.

This. People coding for a living tend to see only the risk in terms of the network, and that is usually fine, because they're _excellent_ at finding different ways how the network can be vulnerable. What they fail to take into account, though, is that Bitcoin is a currency, and there are much bigger risks that a currency faces than network centralization - namely: 
- Irrelevance (enemy  that nobody except Mike Hearn seems to recognize; do you want a super-secure, decentralized collection of Beanie Babies?)
- Infrastructure centralization (what if Coinbase runs 95% of bitcoin?)
- Stake centralization (a currency not widespread in use can be _easily_ wiped out using very old-school, $5-wrench-esque ways), as well as 
- Vulnerabilities due to size (right now, any random Saudi prince with a couple millions to spare can disable the network for weeks via various means, killing Bitcoin).
Somebody needs to write a full post addressing these points. Finding network vulnerabilities is fine, but a lot of people just don't understand _money_.

I only have anecdotal evidence against that (seems to grow much faster than that to me), so I won't bring that out; where does he get the 17.7% number from? Is that worldwide, or regional? 
His whole premise lies in this: the estimates track what was seen in the last few years in terms of bandwidth growth. If the tracking is reasonable, many of us big-blockers will be for it; but I suspect it might be cherry picked to favor the conservative view, and there needs to be more debate on this.

A conventional "bank" as commonly understood, not including murky "investment" banks, has two functions: 
1) To store your money in a (relatively) secure way, and to facilitate convenient transfer of such money (debit cards, money order, checks, electronic transfer, ATM). 
This part overlaps with Bitcoin, and is what the community aims to replace, and is the primary selling point of Bitcoin: You control your own money, you don't have to rely on a bank to store and transfer wealth, you decide.
2) Take deposits with interest and give out loans (fractional reserve). 
This part is _not_ overlapping with Bitcoin as it stands. There are many in the community who believes because Bitcoin allows convenient money transfer and storage (see (1) ) and deflation, we won't need to put deposits in banks anymore and hence this function will be indirectly crushed by Bitcoin. Not everyone shares that opinion.

If you _really_ want to do it, find a friend who has a coinbase/circle account, get him/her to buy there and sell it to you and take Paypal. 
Bitcoin sellers generally frown upon Paypal because it's very reversible - you send a dispute to Paypal for _any_ reason and the seller is in trouble; but bitcoin on the other hand is irreversible. If you do the tx with a friend who can trust you (because he/she knows you in real life), that's a lot better.

If you don't have confidence (or recruiting a team of people who have the confidence), setting up a full-blown exchange might not be the best idea; above all, you'll need to be really competent at securing everything. It's Bitcoin, exchanges have big targets painted on their backs, hackers will always be after you. 
If you want to popularize Bitcoin locally, it might be better to do it in a slightly more labor-intensive way. There are services in many countries already that sells Bitcoin through convenience stores (link to in-store machine, either prints private key that customers can sweep or transfers directly to customer's address via webcam), so it might be profitable to emulate that. Set up Bitcoin ATMs, explore remittance services, hold community events, the possibilities are endless.

It might be easier to interpret and promote that way, but at its very technical core, Bitcoin is not "we'll do any tx for anyone for really cheap". 
Bitcoin is "we'll do any tx the nodes and miners agree on, and the miners/nodes are decentralized so they'll end up following incentives provided by the consensus protocol". That it turned out to be fast, anonymizable, cheap and open to everyone was a byproduct of the protocol and incentives (so far).

Bitcoin will cease to be a payment network for pretty much anything. It also makes it even more difficult to anonymize transactions; black markets will be greatly stifled with it. 
Is $650,000/day something Peter Todd, buttcoiners or coinwallet.eu can come up with? Unlikely. Is it something a hedge fund, or even a bastard cousin of some middle-eastern asshole, can throw at us without even blinking? You betcha.

@_date: 2015-07-08 03:21:57
A counterpoint: at the current price and block reward ~$900,000 (3600 BTC) is taken by new investors just keeping the price stable. An attacker buying $650,000 and using them to spam tx for a sustained period of time can devastate the usability of bitcoin and make it unlikely for those new entrants to buy more. So prices can actually fall, 650k &lt; 900k.
This calculation, of course, changes with each halving and no longer works when block reward becomes insignificant, but we won't be there for a while yet.

To be fair, the network as it goes does need the miners to at least care about the system's medium-term health (as opposed to very near-term profit); this also happens to align with the farms having invested so much in infrastructure. Perhaps what we need is to give miners easier, more user-friendly controls over which transactions to take? The network is indeed built on letting miners choose which txs to include (and, by extension, other miners at least tolerating that decision); my impression is that lots of miners - Chinese big farms included - might either find such controls too difficult or weren't educated enough.

If x&lt;=y, there is no incentive for Alice to use LN, she can just do it on chain.
If x &gt;y, Charlie faces a risk: If Alice never does tx through Charlie again, Charlie can broadcast the tx at cost x, but he'll lose (x-y) in fees in the process. Alice effectively just sent something onchain at Charlie's expense. Why would Charlie put up with such a risk?

I'm actually fairly convinced that Lightning is _necessary_ if Bitcoin is to succeed; it actually solves two very stinging problems:
1) Enables _much better_ 0-conf;
2) Lets bitcoin scale without the size of the blockchain going out of control. Bigger blocks are still needed, but the blockchain (full nodes) will remain manageable by your average citizen / small business. 
It'll be really hard for Bitcoin to succeed (and remain decentralized) without these.
@_date: 2015-07-13 02:35:43
Making a corollary from what others said in the thread: Once the following is set up, any censorship short of a complete internet ban is doomed:
1) A way to encode tx (&lt;1kb, very small) in much larger, innocent-looking traffic. Packet inspection censorship becomes impossible.
2) A multitude of "bridge" nodes outside of the censorship zone that takes these kind of encoded tx and relay them to other nodes, Tor-style. Banning by address becomes difficult. 
For running a node, substitute "blocks" for tx in the above.
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:00:05
Lightning enables cryptographically "locked" transactions that can be "settled" once in a while between multiple parties. If your many tx can be compressed into a single entry on the blockchain you can afford to pay a much higher fee per settlement before one gets to the "pain point" where one stops using Bitcoin.

You do realize that gold is only valuable because other people will take it in exchange for goods and services, and have done so for thousands of years, right? Bitcoin is not even _close_ to having that status. Despite all its shortcomings, I can give the pizza store dude a gold coin today, and _he will friggin' get me a pizza_. 
Bitcoin is only valuable because it's a superior currency. Kill its use as a currency, kill the ecosystem around it, and the blockchain becomes pointless databases that's just taking up disk space.

There are a number of things that can lead to a cryptocurrency's "death": Unresolvable technical weakness that was exploited, user migration to a superior solution (not necessarily crypto), coordinated government intervention, infrastructure collapse, etc. But all of these, in the end, "kills" the currency via the same way: loss of confidence. 
A currency is only as good as the number of capital-holding people who believe in it. The confidence can be reinforced by a number of factors:
- Crypto: free flow, scarcity, difficulty of attacking scales with size, auditable algorithms in open code
- Fiat: price stability while the government lasts, violent coercion, network effect
- Precious metals: scarcity, long history
But in the end they're all the same: Without a good number of capital-holding people believing in them, they are nothing.

Did you even _read_ what Lightning Network is? Without the level-0 blockchain as a settlement and a failsafe, Lightning is nothing.
If you either: 
- Force people onto truly centralized solutions, aka Coinbase, that _truly_ does not require Bitcoin; or
- Force people to trust a few really giant nodes, because nobody can host a really bloated blockchain anymore (say, if we grow blocks too quickly and we get to 1GB blocks _tomorrow_), removing the trustless component of Bitcoin;
THOSE will be the death of Bitcoin. Something that relies on the blockchain, remains decentralized and gives people the convenience they want without sacrificing too much security can only be good.

You seem to ignore the fact that the spammer can _outbid actual users_ for an amount of time proportional to how well-funded the spammer is and also the blocksize. The ecosystem can only bear a certain threshold of fees no matter the blocksize; the smaller the blocksize the easier the spammer will be able to outbid _most legit users_. 
"But miners earn money! What's the problem here?"
Well, spammer is generating tx and fees but not actually producing anything of value in the ecosystem. Merchants die, exchanges and services fall, users flee, everything of value that was slowly built up from the first bitcoin pizza dies. In the end you're left with just the spammer shoveling money to miners. Spammer leaves, bitcoin devastated. 
A maxblocksize 2x as large simply makes it cost 2x as much for a spammer to outbid legit users, hence 2x as difficult to reach the scenario above.

...Not really, that is the ideal case, where:

You'll probably want to settle a lot more than twice a year, or you're gonna have a bad time with how fragile it is. Also, you'll still want to _allow_ people to get onto the blockchain as a fallback option. 
Bring the number down to a couple million people, and suddenly 1MB looks very inadequate even for near-term growth.

Uh... no, we're not talking about the mempool here, nodes can handle a _LOT_ more than a 50MB mempool of junk, and a simple policy fix of dropping tx if unconfirmed after a day will be good enough. It's inelastic tx fees, and tx fees getting jacked up by an attack even if wallets make it elastic, that's the issue. 
An attacker will need to be 8x as well-funded to have a similar impact on confirmation time/tx fee on 8MB blocks, compared to 1MB blocks. If he creates 7.5MB of spam... the attack simply fails, spam is meaningless, it's just a few day's worth of filled blocks polluting the nodes (~3GB if it lasts 3 days). 
3GB is 10 cents of HDD space on your node, get over it.
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:54:57

All of those methods also carry risk, and many of them carry no less risk than zero-conf: CC can be reversed, debit cards can be fraudulent, check can be bounced, cash can be counterfeit. Yet people still use them! Zero-conf, under the right condition, can be just as useful, if not more, than these methods. I'm just saying that people should be educated to not think zero-conf is absolutely secure, so that they know what kind of risk they're facing - just like they take into account the appropriate risk when dealing with all these other methods.

You guys are obviously protecting the buyers well by holding the coins in escrow. How do you protect the sellers, though?

They'll need to start buying &gt;1TB HDDs!"), while ignoring what actually happens in the real world, the ecosystem, where people are actually _using_ bitcoin. Decentralization needs to be maintained on all fronts, ignoring one side to focus on the other at all costs is very bad.
That said, centralized offchain is very bad, and a very possible outcome... but lightning (decentralized offchain)/sidechain is probably not as bad as you thought. It's just that they won't be here for a while, and we might very well crash and burn before they even get out of pre-alpha.

Did some back of the envelope calculation. Assuming that they can achieve the same hash/W as [these guys]( ~0.72GH/W, and assuming you're giving them the same power as an [idle iphone 4S]( ~38mW, each device contributes ~27MH/s (0.027GH/s). 
Really tiny, but what if you have 100 million of these guys? You get 2,736,000GH/s, or 2PH/s. Today's hashrate/s is about [360 PH/s]( So 100 million iphone-like devices will contribute somewhere between 0.5% to 1% of today's hashrate. Non-negligible, but still pathetic. It only gets significant if you scale up the numbers by another order of magnitude, but that's highly dubious. 
But that's assuming just smartphones. What if you embed them in more high-powered devices? Fridges? (can probably contribute several watts instead of tens of mWs, similar numbers) Air conditioning? (tens to hundreds of watts, similar numbers) 's tongue-in-cheek idea, pool warmers? (hundreds of watts, several orders of magnitudes less in number) We don't know for sure. 
The way I see it, the curious thing about this is precisely that it need not to be profitable... if they're embedded in enough things to contribute significantly in hashrate (and hence difficulty) they can actually destroy mining-for-profit (...and by extension, centralized mining) altogether, because people won't care if it breaks even.

Right, like people haven't been burned enough past November and December. Businesses value robustness, and BTC is not robust at all. It acts like a jungle, so the fee was charged accordingly. Jungle adventure tours are _expensive_.

Secondly, Bitpay might or might not be swimming in liquidity, but they certainly have no obligation to give that out in 5% losses just to satisfy your "low fee" fantasies. Perhaps if your network increased its spike capacity the would have to provision less fees to anticipate for uncertainties; but no, that was shotdown by morons like the ones who frequent this sub.

ASICs will emerge once your coin becomes valuable enough, regardless of how difficult you make it (see also: litecoin). Making the algo more difficult tend to just make the manufacturing more centralized, earlier (more difficult to design). 
A better way to do this might be to make Bitcoin so valuable, mining invades all sorts of previously infeasible niches and use-cases. Heating, drying (!), energy "storage", etc. are all niches that are very decentralized, yet nobody has made proper hardware for them because that requires a ton of capital to design, manufacture and market, and the mining market is not _that_ big yet.

Glad to see you address the much feared 21% attack! Did you talk to Gavin about whether the 32MB hard-cap is actually necessary? 80% of miners will be needed to go over it anyway, I don't think miners are going to be terrified whether the hard-cap exists or not. If we need an absolute fail-safe, BIP101's moving hard-cap might be a better choice - it won't be the maxblocksize, but rather a maxblocksize _cap_ that serves as a limit to the 80% miner vote. It'll also prevent the scenario in which miners giddily vote the cap to 32MB within 10 months from activation - BIP101's 8MB hard cap in the near term will make sure it doesn't happen.
 If you talk to Gavin for a little, we might see an actual consensus happening. =)

So you're dropping legit tx because you don't like them - great. Enjoy the revelation that they'll still come to you in the form of confirmed blocks.

Still way higher than the 0.0001 / tx that many wallets use as default for all tx (not just &lt;250 bytes "minimal" tx), or even the 0.0002 / tx that they use for "priority". Please, if you want to deceive people who are bad at math, at least be a little more sophisticated.

DS1 leads to DS2 and DS7. Surprising? I think not. Short-term pain of DS2/DS7 might be _necessary_ to mitigate long-term damage done by DS1. 
Otherwise, the document is a gold mine. DM1 already happened, DN2 is ongoing, DN4 is ongoing triggered by the possibility of DS2 (!), DP6/DP2 ongoing, AB8 happened, AB4/AB10/AB15 ongoing, AC1 ongoing, OG11 ongoing, OM2 happened... and so much more.

8GB happens in ~2036. If in 2036 we don't have gigabit everywhere (you know, a technology we have today that can _already_ handle 8GB for non-mining nodes, and are being deployed to _homes_ as we speak), we have bigger worries than Bitcoin.  
For comparison, look up what's the typical bandwidth we had for dialups 20 years ago.

Kudos for following up?

Miners already have the power to prevent increase beyond 32MB if they want to (and they'll need 81% to move it!), I don't see why they'll want a 32MB hard-cap on top of that.

Kinda unlikely, considering dollar or euro under a mattress is probably much less volatile than bitcoins. If you can't keep BTC liquid there's very little chance for mass adoption.

Jan 11th is the earliest date it _can_ go into effect, not the day it _will_ go into effect. If it does gain 75% the whole fight is already over, and switching will be pretty straightforward.

Everyone who support it likes to think it's what they _think_ it is, because code doesn't exist yet. The thing is, lots of these wishful thinking contradict the BIP (lower bound, resistance to 21% block-shrinking attack, etc.), so they're just wishful. 
It baffles the mind how so many miners can stand behind something that's not even available for scrutiny yet, it says something about how responsible they are. As an XT-supporter, I view BIP100-supporting miners in dimmer light than miners who remain honestly on 1MB so far - say, Eligius.

You will leave this nerd alone!

You might also do well to remember that without BIP101, none of the other proposals will even be on the table. Whichever BIP we adopt, you have Mike and Gavin to thank - he's a brash pusher of his own vision, but that is _effective_.

"Mods are asleep, post BIP101!"

You do realize that even the SWIFT network has _way_ higher tps than 3.5, right?

We actually do have a "only_bigblocks" (BIP101) compilation of Core. Check it out: 
Core won't merge it for reasons repeated ad nauseum, but if you like BIP101 yet are skeptical of XT's "other changes" (not that I think they're bad, but convincing you will take another post), take a look.

Alternatively, if they so wish (I don't see why, but this is a thought experiment) Antpool and 21 can block it for a long time. In fact if two out of three of the largest pools (Antpool, F2pool, Bitfury) collude they can block any change indefinitely. Three of them colluding can pull off a 51% attack any day of the year! _It takes just three compromised people to ruin Bitcoin!_
To add insult to injury, Bitfury is completely private and Antpool is semi-private (has a large cloud mining component where users don't control their miners). 
If you ever see people concern trolling about future Bitcoin centralization, just tell them to take a hard look at what's already going on today.

If a wide variety of people don't _want_ to use Bitcoin because they can't _use_ it, and hence has no incentive to run nodes, bitcoin is not decentralized. =\
Also, anonymization services like Joinmarket that forms one of the two pillars of Bitcoin's fundamental value (anonymity; the other being fixed supply) _needs_ cheap tx to work for the people. You of all people should know this. =\
