Awesome, thank you!

Fair point, but this isn't really a good argument to use for why PHP is bad. This kind of stuff happens in every language, regardless of how easy it is to use. The real issue at hand is that inexperienced programmers are creating financial systems that depend on being secure and accurate.

Is it just me, or is the address not listed on the website anywhere? I'm visiting Warsaw in a few weeks and I'd like to check this out, but I have no idea where it is. My Polish can't be that bad... can it?

There is nothing wrong with PHP, apart from maybe some minor issues with api consistency. People just like to hate on it. You can butcher a piece of code like this in any language.

That can happen in any language. It is not PHP's fault.

Virtex starts at 3% and goes down depending on your trade volume. LibertyBit is 0.5% regardless of volume.

I've been watching this exchange with interest for quite some time now. The only reason I wasn't using them is because volume is low and the price of coins is generally higher than CAVirtex. 
After this fiasco with CAVirtex thought, I think I'll be switching. I'd rather pay a higher price for the coins and know that I'm getting decent support when I need it.

This looks fantastic. I'm in Toronto as well, so this should be quite convenient.

And their trading engine is slow, way slower than Gox. During a period of brief activity last Sunday, it slowed down to the point where it was impossible to submit orders and the order book showed like 15 orders processed for the entire hour. 
Buggy, slow, low volume, high fees, terrible support. The only reason they are afloat still is because we don't have any better options in Canada at the moment.

Whereabouts on Bay St are you?

So when do I get to visit the Bay St offices?
