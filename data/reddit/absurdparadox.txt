Any proof beyond them simply adding bcash?
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:30:10
Something else to consider: by centralizing it, and making it so it is not feasible to run a node or miner outside of a datacenter, it makes it much easier to censor bitcoin. 
That is why I think Bcash is truly dangerous in the long run. By vastly increasing block size (which they will have to do with higher adoption), they make it much easier to shut bitcoin down. And now, many of them claim nodes aren't needed at all. Their vision of bitcoin in 10+ years is only a few massive datacenters running it, all for the sake of keeping everything on-chain.

If you think this is the only downside, you don't understand the issues.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:04:00
Regarding a clipboard attack, when you sign the transaction on the trezor, it displays the address on the trezor for confirmation, so you would see it there.


This is my real fear, however, lol.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:18:34
The biggest reason not to use a segwit address is if you are concerned about a fork that doesn't support it. Pretty unlikely at this point I think.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:59:25
The mod team should not allow these kind of posts. They make the entire sub look moronic and pretty.

It's stuff like this that drives ancaps to bch and call BTC supporters "socialists", lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:58:43
How can you know anything other than what I told you given you didn't know the transaction size or the fee I paid? lol
I paid 0.00020357142857142858 BTC per kB, which was a fee of 0.0000342 on 168 bytes. Now, I will say that per kB number I did not do the math on, that is just what a block explorer is reporting.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:18:11
The basic argument is that increasing the blocksize is not sustainable and a very poor solution, not to mention they intentionally forked without some bug fixes.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:52:50
hahah I see what happened. So I used one site for one number and the another site for another number, but the two sites are reporting the transaction size differently. I never did any of the math myself.

I agree with this -- I consider him an "opponent", but I don't think his motivations are malicious.

@_date: 2017-12-14 06:16:37
That's the real problem with the other sub and big blockers in general - the arguments are never technical
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:08:50
One thing to keep in mind is that it would be rather difficult to truly mess up writing a seed down if you can follow basic instructions
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:53:48
Nah, the transaction is only 168 bytes actually, haha.
Also, waiting worked.

I guess this is the world we live in. Statements of fact are somehow supportive statements
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:46:25


And what happens when the 8mb is not big enough to scale properly? What then?
The reason I support BTC over BCH is because there is clearly much further thought down the road. BCH is so clearly a fix-it-now band-aid, and as a programmer that works with a lot of legacy code, it makes my skin crawl.

Many of these issues are the problem of comparing bitcoin to credit card transactions, which is not a fair comparison. 
One needs to compare bitcoin to cash. If you want services such as credit card chargebacks or instant verification, you need to create a business and technology that does these things. I.e. a bank.

This is probably because the Coinbase site itself and the Coinbase API use different levels of caching for their pricing. So, when you have an app that checks coinbase, its a price that is updated every 5 minutes, but when you use their site, its updated every 2 minutes, for example.
Or atleast something similiar, would be my guess. Surely they're not simply scamming.
@_date: 2014-07-25 18:14:19
Having been an anarchocapitalist for something like 10 years, it is CRAZY how common it is to see both these sorts of sentiments on the internet, and the fact that they have upvotes. Pretty much everyone I know in real life is a libertarian of some flavor now, too. Things really are happening.

Exactly. so many people forget that when you sign a credit card receipt, all you are doing is agreeing to pay for the thing you are receiving. Even thought credit cards are instantly verified now, the real "binding thing" is the mini-contract you are signing, technically. Sounds ridiculous, I know.

If you would like a real answer that isn't loaded with vehemence for the goverment or banking system (don't get me wrong, I have much of the same feelings), the real answer is that banks aren't investigated for such things because banking regulations have "already solved" the problems.

You said you would feel safe keeping 5 btc -- why not more? I feel like if it is truly that secure, any amount would be safe, right?
And yeah, I had heard that about trezor/nano, but haven't looked into them much. Not too familiar with how they actually work. My first fear is "what if I lose the trezor" etc (I'm sure is an answerable question)
 I have no problem switching to Breadwallet, just last I looked into it, Mycelium was "the best". 
That brings up another thing -- how do we REALLY know that Breadwallet is truly as secure as it claims? Like, how is that verifiable?

I did something similar -- I bought some btc every week, and using my Shift card, that was my eating-out money for the week. Anything left over, I would just keep. A year later, it REALLY added up and has since gone 10x in price.
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:13:13
Personally I would have resisted, but that is because I am a True Believer (tm) (I have never sold, and I am too risk adverse to sell highs, for fear of it not being the top, and then it never coming back down).

@_date: 2017-10-16 14:54:22
One easy (but not "pure") way to do this is using a Shift card with coinbase, combined with automatic buy schedules.
For example, I auto-bought $100 a week, to the account linked to my Shift Card, and then my eating-out budget was only what was on my Shift card. So, got to spend btc wherever I wanted, as well as create an incentive for me not to eat out as much. The savings added up pretty quick, but I was still "spending"
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:39:27

Many of you are bitching at Coinbase for doing this.

This guy understands "getting the ball rolling", guys. Yes, the system is not perfect, and being a software dev myself, I understand the sentiment even more than most (I have spent days figuring out how to write a couple lines of code before). 
But, he is doing something. He is getting started. And sometimes, that is better than doing nothing and coming up with the perfect plan. I have learned this through software dev, as well.

This is so crazy short-sighted. You can't go down that road with software like this, especially a protocol. I'm sorry, and I don't mean to be rude, it is just extremely ignorant.
Secondly, many Cashers claim the long term solution is simply increasing the block size. You can do the math and see how that works out in just a few years -- it becomes unsustainable to run a node from a home network. Many cashers think nodes are not even necessary, which is just insane, and shows that they don't really understand how bitcoin works.
Secondly, there doesn't need to be a magical reason, but there is definitely a reason that the block size is what it is, and a reason it was not set back.
Lastly, Satoshi's vision is irrelevant. He is not some kind of prophet. I don't know why so many act like he could not just simply be wrong.
You need to understand that the reason people want small blocks and a 2nd layer scaling solution is to protect bitcoin from governments. That is the many people's primary concern. Massive blocks and an enormous blockchain vastly impacts this due to my previously mentioned points regarding data centers

Got some good replies already but also keep in mind that bitcoin is only what consensus decides it is, but there can be dissenters who think Bitcoin is something else.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:18:40
I think the big difference between LN and on-chain having the same problems is LN can be completely abandoned without directly harming bitcoin, but if on-chain has long term problems it would require a change to bitcoin itself. As someone who's done a ton of programming in the realm of long term vs short term solutions, I would choose something like LN over on-chain errytime.
Also I am glad we had essentially a civil discussion here. There is too much animosity between the two sides in this community.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:56:20


I hope you weren't just trying to diminish my argument into a strawman like that.
However I think there is a flaw with your statement in general. A small number of people can convince a large number of people about conspiracies and technological solutions that others disagree with, and that can create a base that is strong enough to then support an even much larger portion of people to speculate on the price.
My biggest concern with BCH is what if it wins, and then 10 years from now, on-chain scaling is an ENORMOUS problem, and the block-chain is too large to be run outside datacenters, and then governments shut down datacenters to stop bitcoin.

BCH is a misguided attempt at fixing perceived problems that are somewhat based around conspiracy theories.
They think that the core bitcoin code is being controlled by "banksters" or something along that line -- which that is not how open source projects work, but okay.
And secondly they thought transaction fees were too high, and in their opinion the core project was not addressing the issue fast enough, so they increase the block size.
However, in many people's opinion, that is a short sighted solution, and results in centralization of bitcoin, and we need the correct solution, not a fast solution.
Having worked for many companies that implemented right-now solutions instead of dealing with the pain and then having a much better solution later, the Cash solution makes my fucking skin crawl. It is doomed to failure, imo.
edit: I would like to say that is why lightning network is such a good solution, because if it fails, it can be punted on with zero effort.
