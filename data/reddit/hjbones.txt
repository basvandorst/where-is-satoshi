Guess I’m never using dollars again.

Not really. For example, gold and silver have some practical/industrial value. They will always have some sort of value.

Good point. I just didn’t want to have to name off every country. 
I think this is a case of the government allowing bitcoin to become more mainstream and accessible in different ways. So not a case of government getting involved per say, simply a case of government allowing something to happen that it probably shouldn’t be inhibiting in the first place.

Makes me proud to be an American. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:15:48
Which was my point. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 03:04:18
And that inhibits my ability to comically express my pride as an American citizen because? They are more than welcome to be proud Europeans whenever they like, especially when a political leader does something they’re happy about.

This is so interesting that people are doing this, and it’s kind of inspiring.

Actually many big investors are beginning to put money in BTC and other crypto. Crypto has the potential to really be legitimized very soon.

I also think the ETF will help crypto get more legitimate attention faster, therefore increasing its rate of universal adoption. Let’s face it. Block chain is out of the bag and is going to happen large scale eventually and change not only currency, but tech in general. Crypto currency is almost certain to be the future in my opinion, (although I guess it is just speculation on my part. I just feel confident about it). The question is just when. The ETF should speed up the process.

He was actually the guy who founded BTC under an alias.

And Warren isn't scum? I can't believe people still vote for that woman. 
I think you need to brush up on your definitions of authoritarianism/tyranny.

What relevance does that have to the topic at hand?
@_date: 2018-10-19 18:44:35
All of these same mistakes and problems occur with fiat, both in digital and physical form. It's not really a strike against crypto.

Guess I need to just quit screwing around and get a node set up.

At least cannabis has basically already been adopted. Just ain’t legal everywhere.

Have done. Can confirm. Works wonders until you get it wrong. Then you lose big.

That quote doesn’t even have enough context to make sense. So you tell me.

Actually, stocks can be and are manipulated this way. Large firms use patterns and indicators to coordinate buying and selling, since they aren’t allowed to actually directly coordinate. It’s one of the reason charts and graphs and using moving averages and candlestick patterns actually works. I’ve been making money off of stocks for years just following “big boy” movements. It works very well. So don’t underestimate the influence these guys can have on stocks.

Well. I’ve met him a few times and I totally disagree. He’s definitely not perfect, but he’s genuine and has good intentions. You may not like his politics, but hes one of the only reasonable people I know in media right now. The fact that you’re saying these things is a sign that you probably haven’t listened to him very much. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 13:48:24
Only if you’re msnbc looking for a controversy. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:19:59
You should probably check context there. Thanks for proving your ignorance about him though. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:42:15
I’m just saying. I’ve listened to him fairly consistently for well over a decade, and I’ve met him. He’s done quite a bit that was actually not popular with his audience and cost him quite a bit. Not a perfect guy, not saying he’s always right, but I genuinely believe he’s a good person. I doubt you know as much about him as you think you do.
