I am pretty sure the libertarian money system doesn't want your sacrifice charity.

Bitcoin came out in 2009 and has a lot of weird 2009 stuff stuck to it that won't go away, like some dumb memes like 300 and honey badger stuff and QR codes being seen as some high tech thing.

Doesn't require any new hardware, doesn't require building any infrastructure, doesn't require any monthly fees, you can just download the software (or not even download the software) and connect to the bitcoin network. Individual coins have a cost, although early on they barely did, but it doesn't require any of the sort of capital investments using the internet did, you can have a bitcoin "account" for free even if you buy no coins.

50gh/s will earn you exactly zero bitcoin in the next 10,000 years. And "getting a hang of mining" means copying and pasting a command from a website and watching a program run non interactively. All of this is a huge waste of time. The fork wouldn't effect mining but it literally wouldn't matter if it did because your miner is a huge waste of time and wouldn't get you anything or teach you anything either way.

Someone finally realized 2.8 transactions per second is awful and needs to be fixed so everyone started thinking we could just lift the cap and use more resources.
Then people asked how much the relay nodes are paid and it turned out to be zero dollars so they aren't super happy at shouldering more load. 
Then people asked how much the miners are paid and it's a lot but oops they are going to get a huge paycut soon and they all live in china with slow internet anyway so they don't want to shoulder the cost.
So people said "fine we will make up a thing to replace bitcoin for payments" but then it turned out things like lightning networks require huge signatures and to be able to add and remove stuff from transactions faster than once a block so now the plan is to mess with the bitcoin protocol to let you change transactions before they confirm and move signatures to a new file that no wallet currently out understands. And clearly users aren't super happy about this either.

Why do people keep posting this stuff?
Do you WANT banks to directly compete with bitcoin with cryptocurrency?

Transactions fail if they are dropped from the memepool. This happens infrequently but not never. 
Did you not know that?

The answer is two fold:
1) in an ideal world where people all used perfect methods of random generation the answer is basically no, the odds are absurd and it will never happen.
2) in the actual world we live in where people fuck up random generation that has been a repeated bug in many bitcoin wallets including some of the most popular ones with times where blockchain info was giving everyone the same wallet and where most android wallets were drawing from the same pool of known seeds. 
So basically if you use a hypothetical universe wallet it can't happen, if you use one in the real world it's happened quite a few times.

The big one is that most users and most bitcoin businesses are strongly set up around the idea of transactions being paid for by the block subsidy and would not be willing to pay personally.

Bitcoin: a data center to data center based electronic currency.

Who told you that? That isn't how bitcoin works. There is no requirement miners mine anything. The fact they have in the past doesn't require they do so in the future.

When the blocks become 2mb it will, before that it won't.

What kind of fucked up infants do you have that are seven years old? 
@_date: 2016-01-19 01:38:51
It's weird how in an era where few people even had a computer people were paying thousands of dollars to buy one AND a modem AND then paying one dollar an hour to get internet and it STILL was taking off, While bitcoin is free and available to everyone and even given seven years doesn't even have a fraction of the 30 million users the internet had in this article.

Your mining equipment will never actually mine any actual bitcoin so why even worry about the fork or anything? All you are gonna "learn" is to watch some dos window run a program that costs your mom electricity. It's not super educational or a skill or anything.

For some weird reason this forum cheers that like it's good for bitcoin but it's pretty easy to see that bitcoin is most active and most bitcoin businesses are in countries that have strong and stable economies.

If bitcoin becomes actually useful for breaking the law and is actually widely used that way the end result will be the exchanges facilitating the law breaking being shut down.

Okay, but if nodes get fragmented on what is or isn't a standard transaction you are just going to make double spending EVEN EASIER since what your node relays and what some other node relays will differ even more.

The only manipulation attempt going on here is you. Trying to get people to hold falling assets because you don't want your failed investment to lose money.
