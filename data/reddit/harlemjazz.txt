be honest with him.  It's not like *you* stole them.  Hopefully he's understanding about the shittyness of it all and you don't jeopardize losing a good friendship over this.  Best of luck mate

such a classic clip.  In 1 year: "Bitcoin?  I don't get it... What is Bitcoin anyway?  It's like an online money?  Alison, can you explain what Bitcoin is?"

Coinbase also allows you to go straight to a paper wallet.  Are there any additional risks by just doing it that way?

ah, yet another person who freaked out, condemned and shamed the company publicly, and now is eating crow. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:02:37
search Coinbase and "high risk" on and you'll see why.

Ouch. Ouch.

Agreed, I was a bit weary, but everything worked out fine.

yes... or no.  just do it.

i like it.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:11:12
so you purchased a Trezor, then lost your job, and requested a refund?  That seems rough, and I'm sorry for you - but I'd cut them some slack as you are also asking to be cut some serious slack.

this is why this shits nuts.  If you have a lot of money invested, those are MASSIVE swings in literally seconds.

@_date: 2013-11-12 19:49:13
I agree.  If you really believe in the long-term value, it almost wont matter if you buy at $250, $350, $450.  Just get in however your means allow, and wait a year or so.

"I'd like to buy a car, but I don't want to go to a dealership, or to Autotrader.com or Cars.com, and definitely not on Craigslist.  Where can I buy a car?"
Seriously, Coinbase and Local Bitcoins are legit.  Wait it out - or you also can do online trades from person to person on LocalBitcoin - which if you can figure out might satiate you.  Otherwise, get some rest - hope your arm heals proper.
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:02:48
I'm not too certain either.  But this is good info, thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:56:16
if this would hold, expect BTC to rocket to a bazillion dollars.

Beetlejuice, great flick
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:42:58
late to the thread, but I totally agree with the mindset.  I think we all need to try and have this approach, if nothing else for stability in the market.  I'm not pulling out until it's literally a sum that I could buy a house or something with.  If the predictions are even remotely accurate, and BTC holds as I really think it will - and as the Global economy NEEDS it to - there is no reason to sell.  Ride it to the top.  Watch the dollar crumble.

how bout "The Bit-ches" and they can possibly publish a highly informative Bitcoin handbook down the line called "The Bitchhiker's Guide to the BTC"
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:06:29
I think this is the stand up move, and a great way to get his buddy truly "sold" on BTC.  On the flip side - loser of bet didn't get it, put his $ where his mouth was, and is now double-shit out of luck.  Dems the breaks, kid.
