Jesus I can't believe people do this. They're just walking down the sidewalk and find $500 and decide to quit their job because apparently they can make more money just walking down the sidewalk.

How do you expect this to stay the mainstream accepted crypto currency? Look at all the technical terms. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:12:28
It’s not that hard. They don’t give a fuck about the timing. Except for long term vs short term (longer than one year). You just worry about your profit. If you are only trading between coins then that isn’t taxable. Only converting to usd is taxable.

Hopefully bitcoin will eventually work as a currency so you can just spend it without having to take it as income

Fwiw coinbase has all assets insured

That's not healthy in any investment situation

You only lose money when you sell below your buy in point. Even if it goes to $4 again, you haven't lost anything until you click "sell"

In an alternate universe he held them and the butterfly effect caused bitcoin to fall from grace and disappear

Be careful about putting money into depreciating assets

You sold your asset that has appreciated 1000% this year, to pay off someone else's debt with interest rate of ~10% at worst...

I got bitcoin to do sports betting years ago. I won a little bit and got bored and transferred it back to my wallet and... forgot about it. LOL if I had been watching the market I probably would've sold way sooner

Who tf would do that with such a volatile instrument?

But there's effort in conversion and risk cost in owning btc. Basically you want to spend the crappy money first. 
You can buy something for $10 or $10 of btc. Why spend your $10 of bitcoin when it could be worth $100 next year?

Actually the most relevant one is credit cards. Look how long that one takes compared to the others
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:29:44
Yes and it will lower the price so we can afford some more

My coinbase account doesn't have my social and let's me withdraw like $2000 per day without providing it. And no one finds out about it

If everyone holding an asset decided to liquidate, the price crashes
