The police response time is dependent on where you live. I'm at least a good 10-15 minutes away from the nearest dispatch. I'd prefer not to rely on government support 100%.
That being said, It's the safest time to be alive in all of history. And the odds are favorable that you'll never have a bad run in your entire life if you live in a first world country. And if you're willing to accept that risk, that's fine. I personally like to minimize risk to myself and my family as much as possible.
As I said in another one of my posts. It's all about the risk you are willing to impose upon yourself and others around you. People who don't feel comfortable carrying a weapon, shouldn't.

I pity those who pass legislation that doesn't allow people to protect themselves. I'd rather myself and criminals be armed than just the criminals.
In a perfect world neither would, but this world isn't perfect, and it never will be.

Education. Switzerland has very high gun ownership and none of these problems.
Weapons aren't the problem. People are.

This is true, but I'm sure they feel like they need them to survive. You've only proven my point. In this scenario you'd be the one without the weapon.
Dan Carlin brought up a really interesting point in his last podcast on weapons of mass destruction. It's probable that we'd already have another major ground war the likes of WW2 had nuclear weapons never been developed.

Apply that thought to nuclear weapons. It's deterrence. When everyone has a weapon, no one does.
I'd love to live in a world without weapons but that world doesn't exist.

I understand what you're saying, but the way I see it, it's all about the risk you're willing to endure. If you're willing to live in a country that doesn't allow weapons, that's fine. But you're putting yourself in a position where the odds can be against you in a nasty situation like OPs, and then you're relying on your local police for defense. Response times aren't always fantastic.
You can make it harder for people to acquire firearms or weapons, but as long as they're being manufactured they will inevitably end up in the hands of criminals. So all you've done is removed the potential protection normal law abiding citizens might have had. 
Criminals don't generally acquire weapons legally. In the US, felons, the mentally unstable and people with a violent history can not purchase firearms. But yet they still end up with them. This is not exclusive to the US.
People who carry something every day do so knowing that if something happens they'll be prepared to handle it. They generally train with the weapon they posses as it would be useless to purchase one and not know how to use it. Concealed carry permit holders put far more rounds down range than most officers do in a year.
This evens the playing field. If you know a way to remove every weapon from every bad guy, I'm all ears.

This line of thinking though still leaves you defenseless when a criminal or person meaning to do mass harm somehow comes into possession of a firearm.
The Paris shootings are an example of this.

I don't disagree with you, I just don't think the average user will ever see it that way.
