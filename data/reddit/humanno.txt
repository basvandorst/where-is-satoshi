I back my encrypted paper wallet up in many places.  The scenarios you describe (theft, hardware fault, or fire) would have no effect on me.
Theft: It's encrypted with BIP0038 and a long password.  Basically impossible to brute force because BIP0038 uses many, many rounds of scrypt
Hardware Fault: My wallet is backed up on paper and multiple flash drives.  Hardware fault has no effect on me, due to redundancy.
Fire: My wallet is in multiple places in different geographical regions of the country, so unless simultaneous fires start in 4 different places at the same time, I think I'm good
If you think that wallets aren't safer then exchanges, then you have a lot to learn.

I stand corrected!

1. I could forget the password, that is true.  But if I die or lose brain function, I don't care what happens with my bitcoins.  I'm dead or unconscious and have no heirs to worry about.
2. My password is not guessable, and it's essentially impossible to brute force a BIP0038 password of sufficient length.  See this reddit article where a 3 character BIP0038 password has not been cracked yet: 
3. This is not relevant to me because of where I store my wallets.  One is in my house, one is my parents house, one is in my glovebox, and one is in my travel backpack.  Nobody can deny me access to all those places.
I think something like  is a thousand times safer for someone with limited technical skills then storing the keys to their money on the internet with an exchange.  With Piper Wallet, you can do exactly what I've done, and the only technical skills you need are the ability to push a button, the ability to send bitcoins, and the ability to stick a flash drive into a USB slot.
