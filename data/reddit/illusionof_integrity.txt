This was me in Hawaii two months ago, except I was ecstatic about us breaking 6k. Jesus how quickly things move..

I'm like 90% sure that OP and the people "sympathizing" are in on some inside joke. There's just no way this is legit.

Yeah but that's ridiculous, and it's going to be easy to track where the BCH came from as opposed to your BTC if they do this.

Thanks for the condescending tone, ass. 
Say what you will but they're the most trustworthy exchange there is from what I've seen. You know you feel a hell of a lot safer with them based in the US than if they were in China or the Czech, especially since you can sue their asses off here.

Tumbling obfuscates but it doesn't hide the source completely. That on top of the fact that they're an American company with very much to lose if they actually committed fraud tells me it's pretty ridiculous.

Do you disagree? Seems to be the prevailing sentiment these days

I think 4 months is a very reasonable amount time to support another altcoin. Should they just automatically expand their portfolio of coins on demand? They have to have infrastructure, the engineering to build and support it, SMEs, trained support staff, and more. 
Calling them out for being down under load and then talking out the other side of your mouth about how they aren't quick enough to take on more of it is pretty weird.

Your math is wrong, you forgot there's a difference between bits and bytes.
8GB is 64Gb
64Gb in 10 minutes = 6.4Gb per minute
6.4Gb per minute = 106Mbps, which is faster than FastEthernet. Add on the 10% overhead of TCP and you'd need at least ~120Mbps internet speeds.

Seriously, it's like a bunch of xbox vs ps fanboys in here. The success of crypto, no matter which, helps us all. 
Unfortunately Reddit is where bitter people go to tell others how their choices are inferior to their own.

Agree it's a bubble, I have a trailing stop to make sure I don't get hosed while also maximizing profits

Most ETH investors have been holding bitcoin for years, myself included. 
When speculating, diversification is a pretty normal thing to do.

I wrote a little Python cron job that sets a stop on GDAX and adjusts accordingly.
