Well you're not helping him at all, instead of explaining your point you're insulting the other party

But it's shitcoin cash, so yes it's a pump &amp; dump.
It's what that shitcoin does

I think swift is SEPA

Funny thing about bitcoin, you can see if it did.
And no, it didn't

So relax, open your pc again. It's near impossible something happened. If it did then that means there was a new exploit found which is virtually impossible at this point

Javascript can't do shit to your files.
Usually it's just used to connect to the server &amp; post/get data.
In this case it was most likely used to send the data she filled in to the server

It's definitely in a bubble, doesn't mean it'll pop anytime soon

When I look at the site, it looks like a consulting firm? You sure you posted the right link? XD
But faucets exist and they usually don't want more than that anyways. They just live off of ads

Inb4 bitcoin 18$

Looks definitely fake but not virus. So your btc is safe but the email entered might get some spam / advertisements. Nothing terrible :)

When will it burst though...
Nobody knows
Maybe tomorrow maybe in 5 years
This is why it's not being sold

Bugger off

No honour in being reckless either
Just because people before you made money doesn't mean you will. I mean look at bitconneeeeeeeect

Funny how you're trying to get people to use a single denomination yet use two when comparing these.
1 bit is 0.009$ and 1 satoshi is 0.009 cents
See how it can be misleading?
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:22:48
Nevertheless I am agreeing, but maybe mBTC instead of bits
@_date: 2016-05-24 08:18:36
Yeah its mostly me and because it is going so well I am trying to get the word out :)
