Yes there is plenty better places than Coinbase. It's a friendly place to start off from, but they do have some problems from time to time and their fees are sky high. I've used coinbase myself for a while, but moved on to Bitfinex and Bittrex. They work great for me.
You can also use GDAX, which is a bit harder to use, but it doesen't have any fees. They are owned by Coinbase, inc.
An other choice is Kraken. I am not using to this site though. But I've read good things about them.

Agreed. Gonna buy more when it's time.

If it is the same guys as Coinbase, they will have trouble. Took me several times to get it verified at Coinbase, just try over and over again. Took me a few days or so.

It is lower than the reccomended, but it should go through within a hour. I usually add a low fee of 0.2 USD. And even that only takes about 45 mins. And this guy has put more than that so i don't see why this is the problem.
