No. Let's not make workplace into more of a social dominance sport. 
Just because your employer needs you more than you need him doesn't mean that you should exploit that dynamic. 
Just as if the roles were reversed

You realize I commented that like 10 hours before you replied to me right? 
In any case, I was curious to hear why OP thought that to be the case, that's why I asked him directly.

Yes you're right, but if you ever work with these untouchables you'll learn to hate them just as much as you may hate your boss. 
But this is clearly not the case here, this is purely people acting out in social media and people in this thread is trying to write it off as good, it's the equivalent of people having fights with their families publicly on facebook, its purely a way to demonstrate to others "how much better than you i am"
