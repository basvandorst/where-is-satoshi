The above is correct, I have been through AML training and that is a huge red flag!
Just transfer it in as few transactions as possible. Though to be honest, I would transfer it to a stock account and not a bank account. Banks are not used to seeing large transaction where stock accounts are.

Hint: Use a stock account and not a bank.
Get a stock account with someone like Etrade. Transfer from the bank to etrade then use it to transfer to other exchanges. Stock exchanges are used to seeing larger sums of money so they don't get upset with it. Banks know the stock exchanges so they are ok with transfering money in and out of them. 
Set up your stock cash account to a money market index and you can gain a little interest on money stored in the account. It is also safer to keep fiat currency in the stock account as they are backed (here in the US anyway) where I would not keep cash on a crypto exchange. lol
I have lost of stocks so it was just natural to use it as the midway point. ;)

I would have guessed less than that. Most people saying it is used for laundering money do not understand what laundering money is. It is not just changing it from one kind to another. It is making an illegal fund look legal. 
That is why the mob got into coin laundries, arcade games, cigarette machines, etc. You could mix your illegal funds with the money from a cash business. Making them look like legal income.

I got out of the market in late 2000 and put my money in cash. All because the "tech bubble" was not a "tech bubble" ;) It was a Y2K bubble as there were a ton of companies that IPO'ed to "Fix the Y2K issue" and I figured they would not be sustainable after late 2000. lol
So I was out at the top just before the crash. Still laugh about it today when people talk about the "tech bubble" back in 2000. I also correctly predicted the recovery in 2005/2006.

Less than that, but yes.
Ranch land with no improvements can be bought cheap. Especially one that has been foreclosed on. Add a cabin, well, driveway, etc and you increase the value of the land. It does not keep up with bitcoin but the land is now worth 6x what I paid for it.

How? The exchanges appear to have a lot of limits in place. Limit to the amount of cash you can send in, limit to the amount you can withdraw, limit to the number of bitcoins you are sell, etc.
So, how do you think they are going to transfer 1,000's of bitcoins to an exchange, dump them on the market, and get there money back?
Or did I miss something? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:06:49
So, while I agree with your statement Ill disagree with your questions.


Sure but dips are short term. In the years I have owned it, it has always gone up. (when measured over those years)


In the long term, yes
Personally, I have maintained an 18.92% Compound Annual Growth Rate in my stock account. Which is not bad!
I just ran the numbers for my bitcoin holdings and have seen a 1259.18% compounded annual growth rate in my bitcoin value. Which is massive!
Will it go up forever, no it will eventually level out where fluctuations will be far more gentle. That is the point where it will be like any other commodity. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:54:27

IT's not a view of BTC. It is a set of market rules that I have. Works for most stocks and commodities.
Simple rule: Vice sets standards!
When the porn industry settles on a video format, that format becomes the standard. (VHS vs. Betamax, DRM vs. MP4, etc)
So, when I saw the news of silkroad (A drug website on the darkweb) I checked it out. When I saw they were using bitcoin as the standard currency my rule of standards kicked in and I bought some.
Another simple rule to follow: When a company's stock drops due to something outside of their control, buy the stock!
Bayer aspirin with the poisoned aspirin bottles in the 1980's
I cant seem to think of another one this morning but there have been many over the years.
Third simple rule: Look for stocks in cyclical markets.
AMD Vs. Intel... When Intel puts out a new chip, AMD stock goes down a lot. When AMD puts out a new chip, Intel stock goes down a little, and AMD Stock shoots up a lot!
I have made a lot off of that one! I have bought AMD at $5 a share and sold it at $10-$15 a share bunches of times in the last decade taking $1000 and turning it into $16,000 over that same time period. 
So, those are my simple rules that tend to make me a few $$$$. lol ;)

This I can agree with! I bought back when it was $1 a coin. At $160 a BTC I cashed out enough to buy a ranch. I made a huge return on that investment but I kept some bitcoin on the chance that it would still go up.
4 years later and it has gone up to $17,000 a BTC. I already got my investment back + a lot more and what remains is just gravy on top. Well, more like a solid gold coating on top. lol

It would depend on the mining hardware. Looking at the current mining hardware power requirements and comparing them to existing solar systems you are looking at needing a solar panel system that would run between $7,000-$10,000 just to run a single mining unit.

The stores in Second Life work on a game currency called Linden Dollars (L$)
So there was no bitcoin from a store in second life, only L$ that were later traded for BTC. Kind of like trading WoW gold or Everquest gold for BTC back in the day. Back then most of the game currencies were tradable on offgame exchanges and when BTC came around many of them would let you trade it for BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-14 20:47:26
Great explanations, how about this one. Back in 2010 when bitcoin was $1 a BTC you had a store in Second Life that made a little money. Using an online exchange for game currencies you bought 200 BTC using 1,593,293 L$. 
Today that 200 BTC is worth $3,354,351.00 USD and you want to cash out. You have no real money invested. 
So is the capital gains on the total or is there some way to reduce the capital gains based on some dollar valuation of L$ at the time?

Sometimes it takes time to arrive.
Back in March of 2016 a friend bought into bitcoin and tried to send me some to test it out. He sent 0.0000001 bitcoin to my address and a week later he asked if I had gotten it. I had not seen it and months later it still was not there. 
In August 2017 I noticed a 0.0000001 bitcoin arrived in my wallet. I had forgotten he had sent it to me and spent a couple of days trying to figure out where it came from.
Turns out it was a VERY small amount and he did not attach a payment so it was processed when it was processed. lol

No, bitcoin and modems are not the same. I was just pointing out that the idea that virtually no one uses a 56k modem is wrong.
My step dad has A model T and drives it around but that is far more rare than 56k modems. 
Often new technologies supplant old ones. Gopher sites were very common back before WWW came along. Now all the Gopher sites have been replaced with the new technology. Will bitcoin be replaced? Maybe, but nether you nor I know.

If it does a full pull back indications are that it could hit 5k-6k range but Im not sure it will pull back that far. If it does then it will bounce around the 5k-6k range for a while before going backup. IMO

The answer is apple. The company issues the shares and there are a set number of them. Shares are physical items, a paper that is printed by the company embossed with the company seal, etc. This gets a little complex, when you trade online the physical shares are held by the clearing corporation in a vault. When you own a share the Clearing corporation assigned the share to the trading partner (ie etrade) and etrade assigned the ownership to you. This is all in the computer, technically you do not own a share if you do not have the actual paper. You can get the physical share if you request it but there are processing fees beyond the standard trade to do so. 
Note: it is 6am and I am on my first cup of coffee so the above is simplified. lol
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:46:24
The wallet shows the date and time of the original transfer. So the long term capital gains rate should apply based on your date and time stamp on your wallet. But that may be too logical for governmnet. lol

Back then the virwox exchange would let you buy bitcoin. Hell, you could transfer your L$ from Second Life to the exchange an use them to buy BTC's. Once you bought them you transferred them to the wallet on your local computer if you were smart. Lots of exchanges were hacked, scams, or went under back then.

If you were short trading, then the gain of each trade could be taxed up to 30%. Thought you may be below the capital gains tax threshold. Im not a CPA but I remember reading somewhere that you have to make more than $3,800 in gains before it kicked in and it also had to do with your normal income tax bracket.

From the article you link
"The phrase “past performance is not an indicator of future performance” (or similar) can be found in the fine print of most mutual fund literature. Nonetheless, past performance of an investment fund or portfolio, and the management thereof, is frequently considered when judging the fund or the management of it. Demonstrating the ability to outperform peers or index funds repeatedly is seen as a way to evaluate a fund manager’s skill."
This is not an investment fund or portfolio. In those cases past performance is based on the decisions of the fund manager.
