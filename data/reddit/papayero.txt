You've misunderstood and written a pretty naive statement. Gold is very good at certain uses, we'll call it the best at these. OTHER minerals are good at OTHER uses, we'll call those the best at those. There are hundreds of them, you can see them in the periodic table. I named Palladium and Tantalum as two random other examples. Both of them are very, very useful in technological manufacturing. They are not considered stores of wealth, not because of some deep intrinsic reason. Even though, like gold, all those metals in the periodic table that you see have important uses in manufacturing. Only gold and silver have this bizarre fascination of being a store of wealth.

It pays bond payments on bonds you hold. That there is always debt on the balance sheet isn't a very meaningful or important observation.

Haha, I would never say it holds no value, that's insane. Nothing I wrote implies that I am insane. I mentioned that the value is inflated, and the fact that it is used for other purposes is not what makes it a store of value.

there's plenty of resources that fit this bill, but you don't see ads suggesting old people turn their savings into tantalum or palladium.

I know this, so we are in agreement. I was just talking conceptually. It's very clear in history *why* gold and silver were used as such. But *technically*, beyond its value from its use, it is not more valuable than other resources, adjusting for relative scarcity of comparison resource.
