Suggesting XRP is not necessary, simply shows you don't know what you are talking about, as it relates to Ripple.
People often do pay transfer fees on IOU transactions. (Depends on the issuer) Bitstamp charges 0.2% for instance.  That does nothing to protect the ledger.  
You see, Jed McCaleb believed, as I do, that mining is wasteful.  They could have added a mining mechanism but again, it's not necessary to include mining, in order to prevent double spending.  (As Ripple has clearly proven)  Mining also doesn't aid fair distribution, as we've seen with Bitcoin and every other alt.  
So you're left with a situation where, if there are no tx, trustline and acct. creation costs, the network can be attacked at will.  If you don't then destroy those fees (as is done with XRP) then someone has to collect them.  So who would collect them? Without XRP, you're also left without a bridge currency to facilitate those cross-currency payments you mention, making any swap only one hop away.  (Instead of multiple hops)
What founders do with the 20% they all agreed to and everyone knew about (this has never been a secret), is irrelevant to these truths.

XRP can't be removed from Ripple.  A cryptographic currency must exist within the network to prevent spam of the ledger.  
Ripple is in no way "destroyed" by Jed or Jessie's tantrums.  Ripple's success is not dependent on the value of XRP, like Bitcoin's success is dependent on the value of a bitcoin.  They are two different beasts but if one is only capable of viewing Ripple through Bitcoin colored glasses, it's tough to understand all that is Ripple.
