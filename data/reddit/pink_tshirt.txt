Does it really reduce the fees? How much would it be to transfer 0.1 btc out right now?
p.s. Do you know if Jaxx is going to implement it? I have 15$ stuck in my jaxx wallet that I cannot transfer.

from the perspective of buying - I guess any company that accepts Visa/MC, have sane limits (I am still at 250$/week and been using it for quite some time) and have good support

has anyone tried ordering it? How much did you pay in fees (serious q)?

Noob question. I need to transfer X amount from my Ledger to some other address. How do I calculate a custom fee (Suggested fee was a bit steep IMO - 17$ to transfer ~0.04)

I actually bought some at that point but spent everything on shitcoins

So I could rub it into the faces of non believers and deniers.

Noob Q: Say i am transferring some funds out of my Ledger to Bittrex. So its 100sat * bytes. How do I know the size in bytes? What custom fee do I set in Ledger Btc app?

Seems like it all came through... Thanks again!

At this point I am kind of happy with any outcome. If it crashes I'll buy the dip.

No doubt. I am pretty sure they were running Nanohash. You can probably see some similarities in the design &amp; branding

Agree that would be wiser. Just hope they dont disappear into thin air.

Well you can use TenX Visa Card, cant you?

I put in approx 135$ it's now fetching 12.5$ a day. So far I withdrew 2. 10 more days and I am even. I will probably reinvest if they don't shut down by then. Whatever. Free lunch every day .

If I had an opportunity to be in a bar that accepts any crypto with my friends I would just pay for everybody and the only thing I would ask of them is to go and learn more about bitcoins. 
Or If I were bitcoin-rich I would just close the tab for everybody.

The CEO of Bitcoin is going to jail!!
@_date: 2017-09-24 04:33:47
Its just funny everybody knows about bitcoins and at the same time nobody actually knows anything about bitcoin.
