You do realise that even having any savings at all puts you in a privileged position. The majority of people even in the developed world live paycheck to paycheck and accumulate only debt.
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:25:41
I’m saying that anyone with savings can afford to speculate with 20% of them. It’s high risk but extremely high reward when you look at the trends for the past few years. Most people looking in detail would accept the cost of opportunity.
Calling someone “retarded” for putting 20% in crypto only makes you look retarded yourself.

For a minority, yes. But the vast majority don’t give a shit about anything you just said, whether they admit it or not, and want to get rich quick off crypto
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:07:51
We need to respect this generations interest in getting rich quick

Actually they don’t. Bitcoin was intended originally as a currency, not an investment. It may not succeed as a currency but it’s an open source project and never promised a return on investment to anyone.
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:03:38
that’s a great chart

Sorry to hear that man - keep an eye on the market - it may continue to shit itself and present you with a good buy in opportunity.
Be more careful if there is a next time.

What kind of paranoid delusions drives your thinking? This is an insane scenario to worry about.

That’s the kind of American humour I’m used to! Well done ��
@_date: 2019-01-28 08:57:26
It’s an American audience so it’s expected. Sarcasm needs to be explicitly highlighted to Americans irrespective of how painfully obvious it is to normal people.

Get the newborn to sign up for an account on coinbase and complete kyc. Have them sign up for an account on binance and buy some BNB to save in fees. 
Load fiat into coinbase. Transfer it to coinbase pro and buy using a limit order to save fees. Send them the btc from your account.
They pick up the btc, transfer it to coinbase pro and send it to binance to save fees. Then buy some shit coins and get rekt.

There have already been so many comments but in 5 years time $20k per bitcoin will feel cheap.
There is absolutely no legitimate reason to think that history will not continue to repeat itself with respect to the price cycle.
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:01:50
Sats bruh
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:31:14
This in my opinion is a key use case for crypto. Although I’m not sure why someone would use bitcoin over a stable coin in the majority of cases if sending money abroad.
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:59:35
Yes we are all the way to 20k now

Your dream is to own a completely arbitrary amount of bitcoin?
Ok, if gambling is not an option, you should simply sell your body for extra bitcoin.
Good luck
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:16:38
It’s not African billionaires piling money into it on a speculative investment. It’s people actually using it day to day as an alternative to their own failing currencies and exchanging value without a third party. Exactly as the OP said, what it was intended for.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:17:19
Annual. If I approach the limit I contact them again. Not sure what they’d need from me to increase it tho

Oh I use revolut as an intermediary between coinbase and my bank account so was more thinking about how I could transfer the billions I will make from coinbase to revolut with the limit

The people who think bitcoin is a movement are in a tiny minority.
Bitcoin and crypto has come to represent a get rich quick scheme for everyone else who is involved in it.

Shame I never heard about this otherwise surely I would have solved the puzzle a long time ago.

@_date: 2018-02-12 15:42:15
You can change it back to fiat at anytime and set your accounts to debit your crypto wallets for regular transactions which is fairly cool.
If you’re just planning to buy bit, lite or eth and hodl it’s not a bad option for the average person.

Wait until BTC shits itself again and altcoins drop ANOTHER 50%, then buy some altcoins
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:56:06
Revolut is a regulated bank so you should be able to raise a complaint but your post is very vague. You can buy and sell bitcoin on revolut but you can’t send it anywhere or send bitcoin to your revolut account so what did you do exactly to get banned?!?
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:04:47
Glad that you posted this. I now feel EXTREMELY BULLISH

Either fomo in and eat the loss or wait for the inevitable retrace. I wouldn’t wait for 6700 again 7000 is the lowest I’d go at this point.
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:22:53
You are of course, right on the money.
I cringe at some of the people arguing with you. Of people who adopt this “us vs them” narrative, a minority are anarchists, the rest do it to pretend that they aren’t merely gambling.
Yes. Crypto is great for people without access to financial services. But those people are not going to make the value soar and let’s face it, that’s the only thing most of us care about at this point.

Yes but stagger your buy ins... now is a good price compared to jan but it could very easily go lower.
