I was not aware that a "Chrypto Anarchist" movement existed.

You have a typo in the picture. I put the misspelling in quotes to point that out.

The idea of a person who doesn't even know about the *reasons* for the existence of government scares the shit out of me. A person so naive as to the basics of politics as to confuse the general will (in Rousseau's words) with the actions of the sovereign should NOT be in ANY office EVER. At least you didn't waste any time in losing my vote.
The *very first paragraph* of the Constitution talks about this. Much of the Declaration speaks about it. Rousseau has a wonderful discussion about this very issue, in fact. It even directly addresses the fallacious example you've given where you overly simplistically equate sovereign power with the general will (in short: you've equated the will of the people with the will of the executive).


Still vague. There are features which are essential to the functioning of a national government which cannot be removed without threatening the state.


And what exactly does this mean? Defined where? By whom? On what grounds? Should those grounds be reexamined?


This is the example you have of state rights? The right to get high? Are you a joke candidate or something?
Absolutely not. I don't care if you're pro-bitcoin, I don't care if you're pro-social justice, I don't care if your for net-neutrality. I cannot, in good conscience, vote for someone who clearly hasn't put much thought into politics aside from the issues which happen to be in vogue.

You clearly missed the entire point of *my* comment, kiddo. His response did not respond to most of what I said, and what he did respond to anything essential. His response was dishonest and unimportant.

Read my original comment again.

And? The candidate didn't say anything of the sort and that's why I asked him. Who knows, maybe he has \*gasp\* views that aren't cookie cutter positions! (Edit: lol nevermind he doesn't.)


This is not true. Article 4 section 2 of the Constitution contains a direct quote from the Articles of Confederation:

Companies have money and people. Bitcoin doesn't. Companies can survive without investors. Bitcoin can't.

Saying that you support state's rights is a vague assertion, and it's one that a lot of politicians use to hide behind issues. That being said, what exactly do you think the rights of a state are? Many times, especially in governed society, man must give up rights for the greater good, and our government is an example of that. Which ones should be (or have been) given up to the federal government?
Edit: I really hope the way you guys vote on Reddit doesn't reflect the way you actually vote. As soon as it came out that I didn't take this kid seriously, the downvotes started coming in on this post. Not because of the post itself, but because of my views expressed in other posts.
@_date: 2014-05-13 00:19:58


On What a shock. I am terribly hurt and offended that the constituency represented by this subreddit does not agree with me. What thinks is the absolute truth and any deviance from it is WRONG!


And what views would those be, sonny boy? It's not that I don't agree with his platform, it's that I question his character (or, again, assuming good faith, his intelligence) and consequently his suitability for public office. I don't want a dishonest person (or a moron) to represent me. You assumed that I had outdated views because you are a narrow-minded person who quickly jumps to conclusions, letting your passions dictate your actions. I hope you don't vote like a child, too!

That's an odd way to say "tries to have a conversation with someone". Are you sure it's not you who's upset? Your language is a lot more upset than mine is...
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:44:07
And Bitcoin goes under no matter what with no investors. Your point?

Noticing a lot of images that didn't load on that top image. Did OP even bother checking this shit over?

Bitcoin's already synonymous with crime in the eyes of the public. Does this surprise you at all?
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:02:51


You're just making shit up now. Good day.


Being less vague would help in the future. The fact remains that it still took you a long while to get the joke.
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:19:19


Once again you reduce an entire post to an unimportant part of it, even after being called out on doing just that. I can tell that you're going to fit *right* in if you get elected.


I'm not doubting this. I'm doubting your character (or, assuming good faith, your intelligence) and consequently your suitability for holding public office.

You might want to reread the amendment yourself! Nowhere does it say that it's "to the militia it in check". Are you reading "well regulated" as "guns are needed to keep the militia 'in check'"? It says that well-regulated militia are necessary for the security of a free state, and that citizens need to have the right to bear arms so that those may exist. In no way is the right of guns granted to "keep the militia in check".


(Besides, the 2nd amendment is boring.)
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:32:01
What's the militia got to do with that? People weren't given the right to own weapons so they could die in a shootout with the federal government. That's what you're suggesting should have happened here.

Thanks for the insightful comment, Sam.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:58:19
Your response further diminishes my faith in you: apparently you're the kind of candidate who will, on the floor, nitpick completely irrelevant remarks so that you don't have to actually respond to the main point.
I will not vote for a candidate that:
1. Hasn't put an hour's thought into anything political besides his platform, just like almost every other politician, as evidenced by your first response.
1. Will not respond to what his constituents say, and when he does respond does so dishonestly, as you did in the above response.
@_date: 2014-03-08 07:25:02


I really wouldn't be calling anyone an idiot right now after how long it took you to get the joke.
@_date: 2014-05-13 00:10:06
That was a really intelligent and well thought-out response. Did you come up with that one all by yourself?
@_date: 2014-05-28 00:00:15
Everyone does know. Even five year olds.
@_date: 2014-03-08 07:35:06
I never claimed it was my picture. You really need to slow down when you read.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:37:17


I'm not. I was intoxicated and used "you have" instead of "there is." The meaning was still pretty clear, though admittedly obtusely worded.


They're pretty evenly split and the number of people voting isn't significant. You're talking out of your ass again.


Clearly you do. You've spent an awful lot of time talking about it.


That's right, just call all of your problems "trolls" and they'll go away. That's a very mature coping strategy.
