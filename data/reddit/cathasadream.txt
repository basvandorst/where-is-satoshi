I see. I think you are referring to the archnemesis of any database, garbage in and garbage out. I totally agree.  Thanks.

My definition might be rigid. It means to me that you reuse a previous output tx, or you reuse the same "money". If I put it like that, I would think for those blockchains that do not have the notion/concept of money of any sort defined would not have this double-spending problem by my definition?

Lol. Sure. Thanks again. 
However, what if not all participants ar friendly?  Like in a food chain logistic, freezer truck company has the intention to cut cost by not setting the temperature low enough. Will a blockchain be of use then?

Thanks for replying. This brings me to the next question do all blockchain has the notion/concept of money? In the absence of the idea of money, wouldn't there be no concept of spending money and let alone using the same money twice?

Thank you for your insight. This makes perfect sense for me considering public chains. I am thinking if the same idea applies to a private chain. My next step is to look into private chains such as IBM hyper ledger fabric.

Thanks for replying. Are you aware of any good quality sources where I can get details on how the statistical analysis is done? I think blokchain.info talked a little bit about it. But I want to learn more. 
Thank you again.
