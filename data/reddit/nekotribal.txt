Congrats, all in this thread, math is strong.
BTW. You are right, OP.
$100 * $150 worth coin = 0.67 coin
0.67 coin * $500 = $333 coin worth
$333 - initial $100 = $233

Miners get block reward and fees from all transactions included in that block.
Block reward is 12.5 BTC right now, expected to be halved somewhere in 2020.
Transaction fees varies, but I'd say 2-4 BTC per block.

Every time you plug in your USB stick, PC has access to it. Malicious software can steal your wallet file. It's an extreme example, but it's possible and it happens in cryptoworld.
Hardware wallet doesn't let any other software or hardware to access your private keys, it's how it's built. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:35:56
GDAX is Coinbase's exchange so it's the same company.
What I meant with no fee was when withdrawing Bitcoins. 
I don't know how withdrawing USD works, because i never ever did it, lol.

Your private keys = your Bitcoins.
Not your private keys = not your Bitcoins.
On the exchange like Coinbase you don't own private keys.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:57:29
Do you control the receiving address? I mean did you send coins to yourself? 
If yes, you could perform CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) transaction with higher fee, that would push your parent tx. Remember you'd have to pay the fee for both transactions, so around 600sat/b right now.
It's the only easy way: receiving address makes new transaction with high fee using this unconfirmed input.
There are ways to use full RBF (Replace By Fee), but it's complicated, so you'd have to trust someone to give them your private keys. Not worth it, in my opinion.
As of now, the tx might get confirmed, when mempool clears a bit, or it may be stuck for up to 3 weeks. Then the transaction will expire and your funds will go back to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:10:24
Well, all my examples were extreme. 
Truth is, hardware wallet *is* the safest option, but Electrum is still not bad. As long as you write your seed with pen and paper and use strong, long password, you should be fine. :)

@_date: 2017-12-11 11:59:41
If a child tx has high enough fee, it would confirm parent tx's too. It's CPFP. 
He needs to own all of the 5 output addresses though.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:51:05
Why do you *expect* that they will lower the fee?
They *earn money* this way. They don't have an incentive to lower the fees. They will always be higher than normal tx fee. 
You can withdraw for free from coinbase using GDAX though.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:38:18
You can't cancel it. If it won't confirm, it will expire.
Can you share tx id?
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:36:12
I don't seem to understand your problem.
If you own an address and send tx from it, use  to figure out what fee you need (money/urgency).
If you are withdrawing from an exchange, in most cases, you have nothing to say. Exchange sets the fee and you pay for it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:33:39
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:10:59
That's correct. The problem I encountered is with low fee tx that just *won't* expire.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:13:35
It doesn't need to be the same address. As long as you move *these* 6mBTC anywhere with high fee, you will trigger CPFP.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:08:10
your current situation is:
ya1 = your (input) address
o1 = unconfirmed output 1 
o2 = ...
o5 = unconfirmed output 5
In order for this to work, you would have to form a transaction like this:
o1, o2, o3, o4, o5 =&gt; ya2 
(your new address 2) with fee high enough, to cover for all of previous 5 tx's.
You could optionally include ya1 in inputs, to have funds for bumping fee. It's not necessary though.
No transaction is stuck in ya1. Outputs are the problem, and these outputs need to be inputs in CPFP tx.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:46:58
They are not *that* expensive. :)
Well, of course there is a way, but comparing to hardware wallet, it's really inconvenient.
On a unused PC without internet, preferably using OS like Tails create new Electrum wallet, write seed using pen and paper, and export public master key.
On your standard PC create Electrum watch-only wallet using master public key.
Every time you want to send tx, create it on your usual PC with watch-only wallet, save raw tx as a text file, load it in safe PC's Electrum, sign it with your private keys, save signed tx as a file and broadcast it using usual PC. 
And still, a sophisticated malware *could* counterfeit your raw transaction when you save it using usual PC, so you'd have to check if everything checks out when signing it. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:37:23
I'll just paste what I said in a post literally 20 mins ago.
If you are in control of the last output address, you can send a tx to yourself with a high fee, thus using CPFP - Child Pays For Parent. Fee like 400sat/b divided by 2 low fee transactions would be ~200sat/b and both of your transactions in this chain should be confirmed soon.
You can also use RBF (Replace By Fee, most modern wallets supports it), or wait for the transaction to confirm or expire, and then send it once more with higher fee.
Remember to use  to check how much fee is needed at given moment.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:51:16
If a fee is high enough, 1st confirmation should take less than 10min, then every next one approx. 10min each.
If a fee is not high enough, it could not confirm at all.
How much fee (sat/b) you used?

Dollar Cost Averaging is safest strategy when buying an asset. It cuts potential losses as well as potential gains. Look it up.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:10:48
At least 1 confirmation is necessary, IMO. 
Tell the seller to use high fee, like 500sat/b to make sure it's as fast as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:13:02
Most tend to say Coinbase is best option for newcomers. 
There are lot of other exchanges though. Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini to name a few.
When buying with Coinbase, remember to transfer to GDAX exchange (same login) to withdraw with no fee! :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:38:29
Then use transaction accelerator. Look it up. Do you have tx id?

Just 'bits' is perfect.

For me, exporting keys generated by a hardware wallet is a misunderstanding. You're not supposed to do that.
You're supposed to store your seed safely, but why would you need to export private keys?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:55:35
Your transaction fee is 20sat/b. That's really low. Coinbase have nothing to with this.
Transaction with that kind of fee could not confirm at all, it will expire. 
If this tx is RBF (Replace By Fee) enabled, and you have funds left, you could use it to bump fee this way.
According to  fee should be somewhere between 150-200sat/b right now.
If tx is not RBF enabled, you can either wait for it to expire, or use some sort of transaction accelerator. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:28:08
Then you should have your 24 word seed written with pen and paper stored somewhere.
You can:
1) buy new hardware wallet and restore wallet from seed (safe)
2) use seed to restore it in other wallet / service (less safe)
Ledger seed is BIP39 compatible, meaning you could restore your seed in nearly every wallet software; Electrum, Blockchain.info, MyCelium, Coinomi, Samourai to name a few.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:14:52
There is no relevance between fee and amount of BTC sent; fee doesn't care if you're sending $1 or $1 million. 
As other poster said, use  to check how much fee is needed. 
Right now, if your transactions are a chain of from one address to another, and you are in control of the last output address, you can send a tx to yourself with a high fee, thus using CPFP - Child Pays For Parent. Fee like 1200sat/b divided by 6 low fee transactions would be ~200sat/b and all of your transactions in this chain should be confirmed soon.
Edit: In your case, however, it's one address paying different transactions to different addresses. In that case, you can either use RBF - Replace By Fee, or wait for the transactions to confirm or expire, and then send them once more with higher fee.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:04:05
Please no.
Let's go straight to bits.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:39:59
What wallet do you use? If it's core, what version? 
RBF option needs to be enabled when sending.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:24:25
Exchanges set their own fees. Most places withdrawal fees are high, as they are a source of income for these exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:51:07
As a workaround, you could download older version of Electrum and generate your tx there. See if that works.

@_date: 2017-12-12 21:24:11
Hardware wallets store your private keys in a way, that no software or hardware has access to them.
In addition, you always have to manually push the button to confirm a transaction.
Basically, every software you use with your hardware wallet (Ledger app, Electrum, website wallet) works like this: send raw unconfirmed transaction to a Hardware wallet and then wait.
When you manually confirm it, it signs a raw tx with your private key and sends it back to a software. 
**Your private keys never leave the device**
That's what makes them *so* secure.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:37:30
They will both confirm in the same block. If you use 600sat/b, it should happen within 10 minutes.

New coins appear at the same public (wallet) address, so if you have corresponding private key, you control them.
There is no rule for getting new coins from exchanges, you have check their announcements / blogs / etc.

I don't think it is replaceable...
I mean, the only way to replace a *valid* transaction with set amount of fee is to broadcast another transaction with *higher* fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:35:35
I meant client like Bitcoin Client. Core, Electrum, myCelium etc, not your browser.
And yes, transaction id.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:02:07
Yes, you are right of course. Turns out I didn't know that Coinbase splits their fee and miner fee, sorry about that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:08:35
Just remember to reset the seed before you start using it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:10:02
Edit: But if you control both addresses, you might as well just wait for this tx to confirm or expire, your funds are safe, so mind the (high) fees.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:59:08
Oh, in that case I was wrong. Didn't know it works like this, pardon me.
So one thing I can think of is they use some "overpaying" algorithm like  to make sure their tx's are always high priority.

It should take less than 10min by average.

It's stored in your seed. 24 words are your funds, the device is just a carrier. If your ledger gets destroyed, you can restore your funds using 24 word seed.

Do you own all of the output addresses? Are they all in one wallet you are using?
I mean if you would send them, can you send them all in bulk?
In that case, yes, what you said would work.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:05:52
Is this 6mBTC only funds you have in your wallet? If yes, you'd just have to send it one more time, with higher fee, to yourself again.

While Greenbits (GreenAddress) supports SegWit, it is a multisig wallet, and I can't fully recommend it since I don't entirely control my private keys. It recently turned out to be a problem for me.

What client do you use?
Can you share a tx id?
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:28:59
Electrum is as safe, as your PC is.
In a world with no malware, viruses and keyloggers, Electrum would be safe enough. But you must know, that it manages your private keys.
The advantage of hardware wallet is, that your private keys never leave the device; they are never transferred to a PC, so it's relatively safe to use a hardware wallet even on an infected PC.
If you manage funds worth over $1000, buy a hardware wallet.
