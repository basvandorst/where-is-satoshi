Well I am a Windowsphone user in the UK. So there are no Bitcoin apps. Actually to be fair there is Copay but the URI on the web interface doesn't ever pull out Copay and you just get sent to the Windows Store to download an app that doesn't exist. 
I am not enough of a programmer to figure out how Windows 10 Mobile using Edge can call Copay with a URI. I would love mycelium on Windowsphone but I dont think that will ever happen.
Anyway my technique now is just go to the foldapp website and deposit bitcoin then use the generated screen in Starbucks. But it's been dead for months. I am in the Uk so Target and Home Depot are not relevant.
Actually the option of importing my gift card into the Starbucks app would appeal to me now Starbucks have a great Windowsphone app. I guess it's a Seattle thing!

Most "normal" people dont know what a fork is or how it will impact them. I think the tweet said they were running Bitcoin XT on production servers as an experiment. 
If there is no consensus then it doesn't matter and Bitcoin will continue. If there is consensus that this is the way forward then they have a working system to move to. 
Things are evolving. Some stuff will survive and some wont.

The article mentioned the two disadvantages;
1. You are not really using Bitcoin as the money is always fiat to the merchant. Thus Bitcoin market is not expanding.
2.  You are ding two exchanges. Fiat to btc and then back to fiat. Kinda pointless for most people who have access to credit and debit cards normally.
On the plus side it has novelty value.

A wallet is just a place where you store a cryptographic key that you never reveal to anyone. A bitcoin address is the address you can receive money. The information about how many Bitcoins you have is on a public spreadsheet called the blockchain. When you want to spend money all you do is use your private key to create a transaction - that is the secret key you never reveal.
Depending on the country you live in and the quantity of bitcoins you want to buy will determine the best way. 
If you are in the USA open a free coinbase account at coinbase.com and they will take your dollars.

This is reddit bitcoiners versus normal people.
Normal person reads Keiser's tweet and says 'wow maybe I should get into Bitcoin looks like it may help in this crisis'
Bitcoiner reacts by creating a thesis on Bitcoin security.
Normal people will open a Coinbase or Blockchain wallet or maybe Mycelium. 
I get that there is a legit debate on how to look after private keys, whether paper wallets are the best and how to make sure people secure coin. However in a 14o character tweet on the Greek crisis why can't people accept it's a journalistic device to mention a thumb drive.
If Keiser encourages people to consider Bitcoin maybe it just shouldn't be over-analysed. Normal people wont.

It all depends on how you see Bitcoin. If you use Bitcoin to make purchases, transfer money or as a daily currency then 'buying Bitcoin' is a little like someone going to Japan wondering if they should 'buy Yen'. Of course you should if you need to use that specific currency.
I am someone who buys on the basis of wanting to use it.
I guess the question was more; should I buy Bitcoin as an investor expecting the price to rise and make loads of money?
The answer for any investor is that Bitcoin is a highly speculative investment where you could lose all of your money. If you are happy with that jump in anytime.......
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:46:27
It doesn't really explain it very well but basically it's not an app - the first confusing bit.
You go to a web address of coffee.foldapp.com and enter in a bitcoin address to return change. That's for later. Next choose a value or in USD to load into the website. Then you click on load. The app will put up a qr and address to pay bitcoin. On android you can use any wallet you have installed but you then get a money request. Acknowledge the request and the website gets bitcoin and creates a bar code. A Starbucks barista can scan this and it looks just like a Starbucks gift card so they don't know.
As a side note in the UK I get some questions about how it works and I just say its a US virtual gift card. That seems to settle them.
Anyway if you have any credit left at the end just click on refund and it heads back to the Bitcoin address you entered earlier.
They could do better if they did a video to explain this but after you do it once you can work it out.

Stand up comedian that got into finance. So inevitably the Keiser report is part showman part economics.
The show is based on facts. Stacey grabs out the quotes and the graphs. She is the straight comedian to the funny guy. 
The show is on RT the state broadcaster of the Russian Government. Is it serving it's interests more than say Fox News serves the republicans in the USA or broadcasters serve advertisers? 
Keiser covers cryptocurrencies. He interviews people in that space. He treats it reasonably and would like it to succeed. 
My view. I watch his show. It is usually interesting and outrageous in equal measure. 
No TV Show should be an oracle about how to spend your money but if you believe in free speech then he has a contribution to make.

It has to obviously benefit normal people to use it.
At present all existing payment systems in the western world work pretty well for most people most of the time.
Most normal people understand cash and visa/mc and that's pretty much it. 
Reasons they might change.
1. Merchants accepting Bitcoin.
2. Discounts for users of Bitcoin.
3 Security scare about an existing system.
4. Currency scare or radical change in the value of currency.
There could be others but there isn't much in it for normal users today.

A Bitcoin savings account seems a contradication in terms. If Bitcoin reduces in value against the dollar by 50% then what use is 2% interest?

I think there is a chicken and egg problem with Bitcoin for consumers. If consumers had Bitcoin and wanted to natively use it for transactions then retailers would increase and BitPay would do more business. However while the investment and 'get rich quick' process is in play then people hold coin as an investment.
Personally I buy small amounts and spend it. I use Bitcoin regularly in small amounts buying DVDs, music, electronic goods and now Starbucks via 'foldapp'.
I think Bitcoin credit cards and debit cards are an innovation but surely they must be the intermediate stage until all retailers just accept digital currency. 
if every payment terminal just offered Bitcoin as a choice then people could just use it. I guess that wont happen though. 
The main problem is Bitcoin as an investment dominates. Until Bitcoin is used regularly as payment then the 'investors' may find it ceases to have value in the real world at all. I hope not but investors may inadvertently diminish it.

This is the problem with the "mainstream". Coinbase is a bank. It looks after money and if it wants to deal with other financial institutions in a world that suspects Bitcoin is used for drugs, bribes and other nasty stuff they are going to be under compliance pressure.
If you dont want your money in a bank put Bitcoin in your phone, pc or paper wallet. 
It's not going to get any better and they (Coinbase) will do what it takes to comply. Convenience at a price.
@_date: 2014-10-26 22:43:44
I agree with pretty much all of that. In the developed world for most people, most of the time, credit and debit cards work well. They do payments and get what they want. Buying bitcoins for 'normal' people is difficult, cumbersome and largely un-necessary.
On the other hand people have a handful of discount cards, loyalty cards and the like. They can work out that they get a free coffee or some free stuff buy collecting points. Bitcoin discounts is just admitting the obvious - pass some merchant savings as customer discount. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 12:16:41
I think the key word there is 'investor'. I was talking about using coins as money like you can use pounds, euros and dollars. If I want to change my pounds to dollars then I can walk into a supermarket and pretty much do that immediately. 
If I want to change my pounds to bitcoin or vice-versa then it seems to involve sending identity check information, transfer fees at banks, waiting days on end or meeting some guy in a cafe and swapping over cash for a QR code. 
No I suspect that for the seasoned forex trader this is 'normal'. However for people with a Paypal account this seems a form of financial torture and certainly a barrier to 'normal' people. 
I actually couldn't care if a 1BTC was $1 or $10,000. My point was a bit more 'bread and butter'. Just when are we going to see integrated websites where you just move pounds to bitcoins or bitcoins to pounds for practical purchases and not speculation? Who is building the 'paypal for bitcoins' environment that normal people can use? When does it stop being a deal in a cafe on rainy Thursday involving cash for QR?
Then maybe 'normal' people will never see Bitcoin and it will become 'digital gold' in the cloud.
@_date: 2014-10-27 23:06:57
Bitcoin is cash that you send and receive entirely electronically.
Bitcoin is stored in an electronic wallet that can be on a device or in the cloud.
Transactions between people are recorded in a spreadsheet called the 'blockchain' that everyone can see if they wish to do so. The spreadsheet is recorded in multiple copies on computers all over the world so the entries cant be faked or altered.
A Bitcoin transaction is as simple as using an email. People can send a Bitcoin or part of a Bitcoin to anyone, anytime and anywhere. 
As this is a person to person exchange banks are not involved. You can use a Bitcoin like dollars, pounds or euros.
The value of Bitcoin is determined by a market price. In the same way as a Euro is worth so many dollars a Bitcoin is worth so many dollars. Bitcoins go up and down in price compared to other currencies. The pizza story was when 10,000 Bitcoin was traded at $50. Today one Bitcoin trades at $350. All currencies suffer from trading up and down. Bitcoin is no different but moves more than most.
Bitcoin didn't sprout from nothing. It was invented as a method of transferring value in a digital age. Money is an invention itself. It is a way in which people can exchange value. As long as people agree what is money then anything can be money; beads, gold, silver, whatever. Perhaps the biggest contribution Bitcoin has made is that at some point people ask - what is money? how does any money get created? how does the financial system work? 
Just my thoughts ....
@_date: 2014-12-14 22:42:35
If you live in a capitalist economy then 'high' or 'low' prices require no justification. Markets are used to determine the trading price of a currency. Of course markets can be corrupted by things like the banking crisis.
Perhaps a better question is how the dollar can be justified trading at it's current price relative to anything based on the US having $18 trillion of debt?

It's not just ads. You look at Youtube and while there are some great videos there is also a lot of scammers. Things like "new bitcoin hack" and "latest 2014 bitcoin hack". One video said send some bitcoins to an address and 24 hours later he sends you back double less 1% commission. 
The problem is people understand dollars, pounds or euros. Bitcoin is this scary thing so it's obviously only used by drug dealers, con artists, snake oil salesmen and criminals from a 'normal person' perspective.

I dont invest. I keep about $50 or so in my wallet and spend it on stuff, make charitable donations, support crowdfunded projects on Startjoin, send small amounts to people to introduce them to Bitcoin.
I wont make any money and will just use it as needed.
I want it to be successful as a currency and if I can help in a small way I will.
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:30:08
I dont come from a pro or anti view on this. For most of the developed world a credit/debit card is pretty good at doing what it does. If you want to pay with an alternative currency then it's going to cost. I am in the UK but if I pay a merchant in dollars when I am on holiday my card company will take a cut.
Bitcoin is an alternative currency so there is going to be a conversion cost. I have about £50 in Bitcoin right now. I am not an investor just a casual interested user. I can see a benefit of buying stuff with Bitcoin to avoid credit card fraud and, to be honest, the transaction time is faster. If you make micro donations to charity then you can find Bitcoin is pretty useful there.
So there are benefits of security, speed and capability of micro payment that are genuinely useful which may make transacting in Bitcoin a 'good thing'. 
Where you have a point is that consumers will need to see genuine benefits to use Bitcoin and right now the difficulty in buying Bitcoin and the fees are not consumer friendly. My own view is we are not at that point of acceptance yet so your question is premature. I would suggest building a Bitcoin economy and ecosystem with liquidity is the first stage.
So my advice is if you have an interest in Bitcoin as a currency rather than an investment just use it and encourage use. At some point it may hit a critical mass that delivers other benefits.

I have 0.181 bitcoins (or there about) in blockchain.info 
I have never had a problem with it. I use it like a wallet. Keep a bit of cash there. I have a Windowsphone app that works with it and it mostly does what I want. 
I think the good thing is that you have access to private keys and it pretty much works on the blockchain directly. It feels un pretentious and does what it says.
I guess if I had 300 bitcoins I would mostly keep them in cold storage but blockchain.info works reasonably well.

I think some digital payment has had modest success. But really 'nfc'. Every year since 2009 has been the 'year of nfc'. No current Apple iPhone has nfc and that is half the market in the USA. Americans even still wipe credit cards despite the security risks and 10 years of chip and pin in Europe.
So I guess if I was Canadian buying something for $10.00 would only cost $1.50 in charges...... 
I do understand the point you are making but it seems at the same success rate as bitcoin..... maybe that's a good thing.

Bitcoin is a highly risky investment. You can lose up to 100% of your investment.

Well not really. It is full a lot of times. The actual chamber was designed in the 19th century to not have enough seats and specifically not allow MPs to attend. There is space for 400 or so MPs but actually 650 elected members. 
In between committees going on, being in constituencies, office work and other things most MPs are not in the chamber most of the time. There are set piece Parliamentary events that pack the chamber. 
MPs pay is determined by an independent body called IPSO and MPs can only debate the report on their pay and not vote it up or down. 
In Hansard it is fairly clear that members of the relevant committees attended as well as the Government minister responsible. Some debates are just there to highlight an issue and get it recorded. They are also there to gain visibility of a concern and inform a line of future enquiry for relevant committees.
Most time in Parliament is Government time where they decide the business. It's pretty impressive that MPs were able to get this on the agenda.

I think you are making good points but they are very much in the realm of politics, economic theory and political campaigning.
The average life of a leaflet or poster is short - very short. A TV or YouTube ad needs to get a message in 30 seconds or less. So what is the benefit of Bitcoin to the average person? That is the only relevant question. Ads present a problem and a solution. What is the problem Bitcoin is trying to solve and what does it do to solve it?
All that in 30 seconds. 
My idea would be something like someone doing internet shopping, typing in the name, address and tapping the card number in then just commenting to friend - you know it bugs me that retailers have all my private data on their systems there has to be a better way. Then the friend says that he uses Bitcoin, backs the guy out of the transaction and pays with one QR code click.
You can then have a slogan; "Using digital money keeps your data private - thousands of retailers accept Bitcoin - the safer way to pay" then.. bitcoin.org at the bottom.
The benefit would be data privacy.

I think it's unlikely but, in a free market, this is down to the market participants.
The why not is because I think that the get rich quick crowd have left the room. What is left is people using Bitcoin more. I think we will also see less of this 'volatility is a problem' articles.  
So in summary it may increase in price but it's likely to be a steadier process than before. However world events might change this as well as an upsurge of speculation.

Anything on a public ledger (blockchain) is ... public. Hence the transaction itself is not anonymous. Now of course whether that is traceable to a real owner is a different question. 
As a side note if you were moving significant amounts of money via an altcoin you would probably impact the price itself. So that move might make your transaction even less anonymous than leaving it in Bitcoin because it would draw attention to it.

Nevertheless there is a free market here. Like gold, silver and so on. There is almost no consumer protection. The value of a Bitcoin could be zero or one million dollars. It's what people are prepared to pay. There is no Bitcoin Inc or corporation here just people using something of limited supply to exchange value. 
For some people like me I just used it to by a Starbucks card and will be having coffee a few times on Bitcoin. As it happens I am in the UK.I bought my Starbucks card from Canada. Due to the decision to leave the EU my British pounds now buy less dollars however by using my small decimal point level of Bitcoin I was able, in a very small way, to hedge my money against currency falls by using my coin.
I had a real world coffee with my wife yesterday using the Starbucks app I topped up with Bitcoin. For me it all worked pretty well. 
So I am in Britain, my Bitcoin wallet is on my phone, the miners are global, and businesses want to sell me goods and services with Bitcoin. Exactly why would I care if congress does anything?

Your friend seems to have already decided. I wouldn't even bother with the subject. I dont invest. I dont have any specific expectations. I live in the UK where banks work pretty well in terms of making payments. However I value using Bitcoin for financial privacy and not providing all my credit card details to make a payment. 
I recognise that if I want to make anonymous payments then cash is the best thing as Bitcoin is not anonymous. 
The dollar or pound has no intrinsic value. It is sustained by Governments making payments in their national currency and expecting citizens to pay them in the national currency. Bitcoin is a free market in which price is determined by the participants. It could be worth $1 million or zero. The market decides. 
It is not a pump and dump scheme itself because no one is persuading you to buy or sell. It's voluntary. That doesn't mean actors in the market cant use buying and selling to make profit and does not exclude  bad people trading Bitcoin or scamming people.
Your friend is presumably an adult and he needs no permission to use Bitcoin or, if he chooses, it does he not need to use Bitcoin. I personally find a 20% discount at Starbucks with the foldapp a good reason to use Bitcoin for some of my daily transactions. It's his choice whether to use dollars, pounds, gold or Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 21:49:52
I am in the UK and I am concerned that credit card details are too easy to steal. I am also looking for a digital payment that works like cash but is easier to carry around.

Ahh well this is purity versus everyone else. Look I get that many people on reddit take a political view on these things. Some people even have economic desires. 
The existing banking systems for most people in the western world do work fine. Credit cards, debit cards, mobile and the like. However if you use a credit card you need to provide an awful lot of information that ultimately makes transacting somewhat insecure. 
So why can't I just like a system that works a lot like cash, maintains a degree of financial security and privacy for me?
Now Bitcoin may mean the end of central banks. It might mean a revolution in commerce and I am not against any of those possibilities. The question was what would I regard as success - that's simple and uncomplex for me. I just want the choice to use Bitcoin as a payment system anywhere I use other payment systems now. 
Dont try to over think this. It was my answer to a question. Thats it.

I am not investing time and energy in a movement. Some people seem to take Bitcoin as a political stance (of both left and right). Some people seem to think it's an economic campaign - banker revenge or something along those lines. 
This is one of the perversities of reddit. 
So let me walk you through a transaction. This week I bought a DVD online for Bitcoin. I know the retailer does not have my credit card stored on a database because I just sent him Bitcoin. That's good because if he is hacked the hackers will know what I bought, what I paid but they wont have the ability to charge my card. 
Yesterday I was in town. I used the foldapp to buy some coffee and a sandwich at Starbucks. I saved 20% by doing that. 
Three weeks ago I bought some USB thumb drives from Amazon using purse.io. I saved 8%. 
I dont actually have an Apple iphone so Apple Pay is not possible for me but if there was a 'Bitcoin pay' then that would be OK too.
I get some transaction privacy, sometimes I get a discount and often I get both. Why wouldn't I want to use Bitcoin? 
You know the redditors all have their own reasons, ideas and political agendas with Bitcoin. All I wanted to contribute was an off the wall idea that some of us just use Bitcoin as money. Maybe you were expecting more - sorry.

Circle and Coinbase run custodial accounts like banks. That is their business model. It will suit some people but not others.

@_date: 2015-08-03 22:09:07
I guess the question boils down to security, convenience and paranoia. 
If you want complete security you use one public address once and that's it. 
Now if you are on reddit you may well want the Nth amount of privacy. If you are a 'normal person' my guess would be you may pass the same address around to receive payments. There is a huge improbability that your funds would be stolen by someone knowing a public address. They could use the blockchain to see where funds are sent. So there is insecurity there.
You know if someone is going to send you $5.00 into a wallet that rarely holds more than $100 then the improbable event of a public address revealing something is well ... improbable.
If you were using Bitcoin to take payment for a second car then you would probably want to generate a one time address for someone to send payment. 
Security versus convenience. You set your level of paranoia (or privacy) required and the value you want moved and then choose.

I think this is rather too philosophical on the nature of freedom.
Regulation is not, of itself, evil. Consumers need to know a transaction is fair. Otherwise a free market is not free at all but rather a 'wild west' of scams, fraud, dangerous goods, fakes etc. 
The only totally free markets are black markets. 
There is no enslavement if the rules of transactions are clearly stated and people can choose whether to participate or not.
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:36:45
If the current banking system works for you then you dont need Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is digital money. It works just like cash except it is digital. That's it.
There is technology involved but understanding how money is printed doesn't help use it or understand if you need it.
Bitcoin is an experiment in digital cash. It is a completely free market and it's value moves on a daily basis. For people who are used to the US dollar, pound, yen or euro this is quite disturbing. For many countries without access to banking it can be an alternative to cash. 
In the circumstances you describe it has no benefit. However some people regard it as an asset like gold and might buy Bitcoin as an investment. Some people who buy over the Internet might prefer Bitcoin to giving a credit card number to increase security. Some people find it a cheap way to transfer funds internationally. 
At the moment Bitcoin is not yet accepted widely enough for "normal people" to use it everyday but it may become important enough over time for it to be accepted like Visa or Mastercard.

Being a socialist does not mean you don't like markets. it is about fairness, equality and letting the state do things when markets are not able to deliver. Such as law enforcement and defence. Most western societies have a mix of free markets, regulation and Government participation in the economy. 
Bitcoin is money. Socialists don't need permission to use Bitcoin to transfer value and pay for stuff. Bitcoin can be used in free markets but that doesn't magically limit it's use only to people who are conservatives. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 01:33:51
Not all 'socialists' are the same. Indeed many people in the banking industry are less interested in 'markets' and more interested in skimming commission and gambling with other peoples' money. The so called 'free market' is often full of scams and fraud. Many people would say that blackmarkets are a the only  real free markets.
I am in the Uk and I have watched Bernie Sanders public speeches. he certainly doesn't like the decline of the middle class and, without taking too much liberties in what he says, I think he is fairly clear that he would like working people in the USA to receive better pay and prospects. He seems to think that CEO salaries are out of proportion to performance and many Americans are not being treated fairly. Bargaining for fair pay for the skills you bring to a workplace is the very essence of market principles. 
Sanders position on poverty seems to be that jobs have been outsourced and corporations have used political influence through cash donations to restrict the bargaining power of ordinary Americans. He seems to believe that the Fed providing loans at near zero percent interest has advantaged those who are rich already. He seems to think that seigniorage is the mark of corporate America with an almost feudal approach to work and pay. 
I have not seen any specific view that deodorant and poverty are linked but maybe you are better informed than me.

1. it's a process by which people who donate computing resources to maintain the network and receive rewards.
2. Anyone can create a digital currency. No problem. But if someone wants to 'create' a Bitcoin it needs to validated by the network as genuine. A Bitcoin is really a human understandable term. The 'coin' is in fact just an agreement by the network that a transaction has happened and you cant create a coin. A programmer would have to inject a transaction into the system that every miner agreed happened. However this new transaction that is artificially created would have to be linked back in the chain to an already valid transaction. Since a valid transaction would be 'owned' by someone else then the new one could not become valid and would be ignored.
3. Bitcoins are created by the result of successful mining. Processing transactions produces mathematical results that turn into new digital currency. The network agrees that someone has done this work. The reward is new Bitcoins.

Is this really Blockchain wanting to much or the granularity of google permissions on Android. The camera is needed for QR codes, identity because Android could have multiple users, location for the 'merchant and map services' etc etc.

As far as I understand it he wants to make education and healthcare free. By free he means paid by taxes I presume.
At present the US has an insurance based healthcare system that fails to provide universal care but costs twice as much as most comparable western countries when measured as a percentage of GDP. This is largely because of the administrative cost and profit made.
THE US does have 'socialised' taxpayer funded health system for veterans. It is more cost effective than the civilian equivilent. 
Now Americans have the absolute right to choose what they want but both insurance based and socialised medicine cost money. The latter of these is only 'free' in the sense that no money changes hands when a citizen wants to use the service and coverage is usually close to universal. 
From a political perspective surely a US Presidential candidate is entitled to raise such an important issue.

The concern is surely that these startup ventures become sustainable. I read a lot of posts on this sub-reddit about non-working atms, places with Bitcoin stickers or on coinmap where people try to use Bitcoin and no one knows anything about it. There was also the 3 year sponsorship of Bitcoin bowl where the places agreed to take Bitcoin and a couple of weeks later everyone seemed to have stopped.
Now I use Bitcoin at CeX in the UK. Everytime I go in one guy is called over to take the payment because no-one seems to have had training or has forgotten how to do it. The only notice about accepting Bitcoin was obscured by a charity box and the payment process seemed to involved the staff going through endless menus to produce a QR code. 
I dont have an answer but it strikes me that after a rush of enthusiasm a lot of places seem to lose the ability to accept Bitcoin through some kind of apathy.

I had a problem once with transferring Bitcoin to the foldapp website when it took literally an hour before the coin turned up. My new technique is just to transfer to Mycelium first and load from there. I am not sure why Circle took such a long time to send the funds.

Bitcoin is money you 'store' in a digital wallet.
To get Bitcoins you have to buy them with other forms of money, like dollars or pounds. Alternatively you can sell goods or services and receive payment by Bitcoin. People might just give you Bitcoin randomly as a donation or tip. Some people get Bitcoin by 'mining' which is the business of getting rewards for processing transactions on the network.
That's it.
You can jump in with more complex stuff like the best places to buy, the best rates and so on but that is simply additional to the question you asked.

I dont seriously think this would happen but if the Greek Government restored the drachma it could give citizens the option of converting to Bitcoin.

I didn't want to specifically defend or oppose a particular healthcare system. My wife actually lived in Germany for a while and they have a mixed system. In most countries most American's label 'socialist' as a pejorative statement private healthcare is not illegal or banned. Mostly core services are state based but some services are private for a variety of reasons depending on country and culture. 
The UK Conservative Prime Minister often reminds people that he exclusively used the National Health Service to care for his disabled son when his son was alive. Its not regarded as 'socialist', as I was choosing to use US terms, to use the NHS but normal. There are debates about cost, effectiveness etc like any health service but the concept of universal coverage is not framed as a short step to a communist society or an attack on individual freedom.
Taxes, from a European perspective, are something to do with providing a good civilized society. Mostly they are mandated by law and enforced in civil courts. In European terms you pay your taxes to enjoy the benefit of not living in a society of everyone for himself.
Now the history of American taxation ever since they had a problem with tea has been strongly associated with government being disliked and and, as you say, an immoral collector of personal wealth using force. 
All the more astonishing that Senator Sanders has been truthful with the American electorate and said he is a socialist.
However the original point was that being a socialist he would have a political opposition to Bitcoin. I personally dont see that would be the case but Americans could view it that way given their shared history and love affair with market capitalism. I guess I always remember Michael Douglas in the character of Gordon Gecko proclaiming that "greed is good".

Of course in an American context the word liberal seems to be a word of abuse and the word socialist seems to be incomprehensible to journalists so reporting issues like inequality, poverty, low wages, healthcare etc becomes a matter of just saying a candidate is ridiculous.

It's not a simple question. Price discovery is what one person is prepared to sell and another is prepared to buy. 
If you had USD and wanted to buy British pounds you would need to check the exchange rate and decide how much to buy. If you were travelling to the UK tomorrow and needed cash then the price would be less important than the need to have local currency on arrival. If you were a foreign currency speculator then price would be related to expected gain.
If you want today's price just Google it or look on Blockchain.info or one of the many price sites. If you think the exchange rate with the dollar is OK then buy what you need for your expected use.
Since most currencies do not relate to anything of real value the value of any currency is based on faith. A long time ago many currencies were exchangable for gold. Now the main value of currencies are that governments accept their national currency to pay taxes. So the 'value' of a dollar is that US government allows US citizens to settle their tax bill on their earnings.

It's ok for investors spending thousands but it's not exactly a retail offering.

I think a bitcoin ATM has something to offer in the mix. If a retailer was really committed to bitcoin and wanted to encourage use I can see them offering an ATM.

As to commercial viability... that's a different question. I doubt whether the number of users in most places could really generate a standalone business.

As someone in the UK I was really surprised that US card processing is a decade behind Europe. For the last 10 years or more restaurants bring a portable device to your table, your card goes in, you type a pin and it's paid. Chip &amp; pin is normal. My card hasn't been swiped in the UK for probably 10 years. 
However I was in New York 18 months ago and someone asked me to sign a credit card slip. A restaurant took my card to swipe it. I couldn't believe it. It was like rolling back to the 20th century. 
Most days at work I pay for my lunch at the cafe with contactless payments. I buy beer at a local pub by touching the card on the NFC sensor. Apple Pay in the UK involves people adding an apple sticker with the other contactless logos on machines. Most are compatible with Apple Pay.
The problem is that the US have the technology companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google who have delayed NFC because their domestic market was using cards like it was 1970. Europe has had the technology installed for years it's just the devices and software made in the US were behind the curve.
The irony of all this is that Nokia put NFC in virtually all their devices and when they went for Windowsphone it gave Microsoft a hardware platform to be years ahead in mobile payments. However being an American company they didn't really understand the significance of this lead in hardware and didn't provide a mobile payment platform. In fact the reverse was true. Apple only put in NFC for Apple Pay when the payment industry decided to roll out contactless in the USA.

I am in the UK and in about a month I am on holiday in the USA so this might be something I would use. 
A demo video would help me understand this. Sometimes things are 'too simple'. I guess the bar code is a Starbucks gift card code or something they scan at the checkout. 
The logic issue I have is that I have the website on my phone and I get a qr card to pay the bitcoin but the qr is on my phone so how do I scan the code to send the correct bitcoin? I guess there is manual entry but I am kind of in need of that video just to see how it works.

Apple has the marketing power of a multi-billion dollar corporation and Bitcoin doesn't. 
The difference is that Apple use traditional payment networks like Visa and Mastercard - Bitcoin doesn't.
Bitcoiners dont use Apple Pay because Apple doesn't support Bitcoin or payment via Bitcoin. 
However if a developer wanted to develop and app that allowed Bitcoin to work on terminals like Apple Pay they could. I believe there is a project to do exactly that here;

If you are going to invest your life savings into Bitcoin you better understand it. Having said that most people's life savings in regular currency is there despite them not understanding the banking system. Most people dont understand how their pension works and are going to depend on the income in old age. Maybe regular money is a government ponzi scheme?
Mastering Bitcoin is primarily focused on programmers. General readers should probably not expect to get too far. 
The average Joe doesn't understand where money comes from, doesn't have a clue about much of personal finance and probably doesn't know who Mr Ponzi was. 
That doesnt make him stupid just someone who has more important things to do in his life. 
If you want to learn about Bitcoin that's a good thing but since there isn't an exam at the end and no standard to reach not understanding some bits of it shouldn't bother you.

Most modern PCs have the license key embedded in the firmware. You can install Windows clean on a PC with no license key and it just activates. Windows 10 works like that. 
Microsoft care little about "illegal" software. They can jus switch off the activation. Most copies of Windows are free anyway from the perspective of the consumer. They either come with a PC or the business has a license.

I guess the alternative is the traditional TV talking head. I think Keiser did stand-up comedy at one point so there is a certain element of showbiz in the presentation. I dont agree with him all the time but at least he talks about cryptocurrency in a positive way.

A. There are several purposes for money. If your current currency works for you carry on using it. Your motivation for using another currency could be several fold. For example you may wish to pay someone who uses another currency or laws in your country may restrict how much currency you can hold.
B. Scammers and criminals are after money. Whether they threaten you with a knife, skim your credit card or set up a dodgy get rich quick scheme. All currencies suffer from this. Bitcoin is no different in this regard. It has some specific things that enhance the privacy of a transaction. For example you dont have to give up all your credit card details to a retailer and hope he/she keeps it safe.
C. Some people of a libertarian perspective feel that Bitcoin, operating in a free market, outside Government control is a 'perk'. Some people also believe the current financial system is itself 'broken' and having an alternative is a good idea. 
The assumption that Bitcoin is competing with fiat currency is a false starting point. Bitcoin has just (2009) been invented and people can use it if they wish. 
It's unlikely that normal people using dollars, pounds or euros in their daily lives will find much use for Bitcoins. However there are plenty of startups looking at ways of using Bitcoin. That might mean that you can buy stuff at a local store via Bitcoin or it might mean that businesses find it easier to send money overseas at very low fees. Normal people may never use a Bitcoin at all but it might turn out to be a great tool for large payments between parties doing transactions like house purchase. Who knows?

Its money your store on a digital device that you can spend like cash. That's it.
You spend it by either sending it to an address (like email) or scanning a qr code with your phone. 
Information about the transfer is recorded in the blockchain. This is a giant excel spreadsheet which just validates the transfer a little like your bank reducing your balance when you use a card.
Money for the 21st century not the 19th.

To be fair blockchain.info isn't an exchange but a web wallet. if you were an 'investor' to any extent you would be doing a lot more than relying on one source.

I use blockchain and others. There is technical risk and other forms of risk. I assume my PC has been compromised all the time. I assume that if a hacker really wanted stuff from me he/she would probably be able to get it.
So then you get to probability. How risky is any transaction online, Bitcoin or otherwise? How secure do you need? How much are you talking about?
Long term storage - paper wallet with a Mycelium Entropy device maybe. Sweep the funds to real wallet or the Mycelium app when you want to spend it.
So my Blockchain wallet mostly has less than $100 US. Similarly for my Coinbase. If I had Bitcoins (pural) then one of the hardware wallets is probably a good idea for me. Then you have ease of use. Whatever the security nerds say if you want to introduce someone to the first $5 of Bitcoin a web wallet is probably what they will choose.
Web wallet providers need to mature their offering to make sure that casual users and the 'normal' public, who will surely be their future customers, are secure.

What in your opinion is the primary aspect preventing large retailers from adopting bitcoin?
It seems to me a 'chicken and egg' issue. Retailers wont use Bitcoin without customer traction and customer traction requires a place to spend Bitcoin. Large retailers, in particular, will be pretty conservative places and go with what they know. To move forward people inside the retailer need to advocate for Bitcoin. Probably the best arguments are security of customer payment data and savings from credit card costs.
Does the largely fluctuating value stop you from ordering high value items?
No. But it all depends on how large is 'high value'. That will change from individual to individual. Arguably as the use grows and liquidity increases then there will be greater stability in price. Most of 2015 it was reasonably stable.
Have you had any issues with retailers regarding refunds?
Retailers dont like doing refunds whatever the payment method. There is a case for consumer protection to cover Bitcoin better though. However cash has the same problem.
Do you think the future prosperity of bitcoin lies with the decisions of governments?
No. The future prosperity of countries may depend on embracing digital currency. There is an economic pressure for less friction in transferring value globally. How far that is specifically tied to Bitcoin or something else is speculation. 
Are credit cards deemed a safer method of online purchasing since you are able to perform charge backs?
You are only looking at this from a narrow viewpoint. A retailer is better off without charge backs. Retailers are carrying a business risk accepting credit cards if a criminal targets them buying goods with stolen numbers. Consumers need to provide a credit card number, expiry date and security number for a purchase. So essentially they are giving away all the data someone needs to use a card fraudulently. Bitcoin is way ahead on security. Consumer protection could be built in with an escrow system to protect online purchases to ensure delivery.
In your opinion, do articles that demonise bitcoin play a major role in the amount of people using this technology?
Mainstream media associate Bitcoin with hackers, criminals, drug dealers and will erroneously title people as a "Bitcoin chief" or "Bitcoin CEO". Most mainstream journalism on Bitcoin is sensationalist uninformed rubbish. It follows that people who hear about Bitcoin regard it as some kind currency for criminals.
In the case of your own government showing negativity towards bitcoin, do you worry about transactions being traced back to yourself?
Most transactions are electronic now. All mainstream banking can be traced unless you go to extraordinary efforts to avoid it. My only 'worry' is that if use of Bitcoin is demonised to huge extent then Governments, ignorant of most technology, will assume someone using Bitcoin just is a criminal because they use it.

I don't really see the point of this anger. Startcoin is an altcoin used on the Startjoin platform. It's got pretty limited utility in itself. You can have some Bitcoin or Startcoin or whatevercoin. 
I have contributed to a few projects on Startjoin. I am not really an investor and I just pick things I like and put maybe £5 towards it. I got 100 startcoin for putting in a few pounds on a crowdfunded project or two. Then I bought a couple of hundred startcoin £5. Right now it says I have £30. So it's gone up a few times the original.
However since I use Startcoin to support projects on the platform the material value to me is supporting interesting projects.
Now if someone is saying Max Keiser is pumping the price that might be true or it might be the platform is building interest. Personally I dont care it just means I can put some startcoin into more projects as it's worth a bit more. However I guess if you are a speculator in cryptocurrency then it might upset you if you buy high and the price falls. 
My personal take is that if you are interested in startcoin why not register on the startjoin platform and just support some of the projects with a few $$. You will get a few startcoin rewards on the platform. I didn't contribute myself but £20,000 was raised to support the election campaign of a Member of Parliament. 
Cryptocurrency, all of it, is highly speculative and only put in what you can afford to lose. That includes Bitcoin, Startcoin and everything else. In the meantime if any of these projects do something good then what is the problem?
@_date: 2015-03-21 11:21:47
Well I dont have a compatible printer right now. My contribution was to make sure the project went ahead as part of a wider community.
I was pleasantly surprised I didn't need a printer. You can plug it in, press the button, and it creates a jpeg with an image of your public/private keys. 
If you are not paranoid you could just print the jpeg. I always take the view that;
1. Assume my PC is compromised.
2. Assume that if someone really wanted to control my PC they could.
So you then have to look at risk. The device in it's straight to printer mode should take PCs out of the loop but, if you are like me, with only small values for everyday spending then no-one will get rich spending time ripping off my PC.
So for me just having an easy tool to generate keypairs is enough.
I guess for Satoshi he will need to use 'direct to printer' to keep his bits secure.....

I seem to get a few startcoin most weeks for the small projects I back. I am not sure that having 'pre-mined' coins means this is a bad thing. 
Maybe I take a charitable view of things. When I spend a little money on my coffee I get a loyalty point or two and every couple of weeks I get a free Americano. I guess some serious Bitcoiners talk about hashrate, mining, pre-mining etc, and these things are important. However if you crowd fund a couple of things and you are happy with the outcome and then you get some startcoin to fund something else I dont feel ripped off or conned.

For me it would take out a step. I use two factor authentication on Paypal because basically the account has direct access to my bank account and credit card. So I have an extra paypal step of using the second factor.

Looking at all these debit card it strikes me that it is relatively expensive. If you want to use Bicoin widely for real world purchases it is fine but if you have access to regular banking services it makes little sense. 
So if you just want the 'fun' of a Bitcoin based card then they all look similar. 
What would really be helpful is to miss out the card completely and have Bitcoin integrated into the Apple Pay/Android Pay ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:56:04
Bitcoin isn't anonymous. All transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Most online exchanges and Bitcoin wallets where you can buy will insist on knowing their customer to avoid fraud and criminal activity. 
If you want to buy anonymously then you are going to have to meet someone with Bitcoin in a dark alley, hand them cash and do the transfer there. A little like buying drugs. 
Bitcoin is money. Expect any organisation that wants to trade in money exchange to need to avoid being closed down by the police. So expect them to want ID.

The chamber is not the only place of work in Westminster. MPs are often in committee rooms scrutinising legislation, select committees will be busy doing the work of investigating public bodies and government, government ministers will be working in their departments. The full chamber only happens as Parliamentary theatre for events like Prime Minsters Questions, ministerial statements, votes on legislation etc.
Most general debates will be attended via the official party spokespeople, interested MPs and MPs asked to attend by constituents. Mostly the idea is to get the debate on the official record. MPs also have CCTV so that their researchers and assistants will be seeing the debates too. 
Actual attendance of people in the chamber is not a good guide to the work of MPs. Having debate at all is a good guide.

Greece represents about 2% of the EU GDP so the actual financial impact will probably be pretty small whatever comes out at the end of the day. The bigger questions are political and whether other indebted nations follow.
In particular the Spanish have an election this year and a left wing anti-austerity party looks quite likely to have a substantial impact. 
The european financial technocrats are wedded to austerity and cuts. The people of many european countries have had 5 years of cuts and millions have had real pay reduced and pensions hit even where they are in work. 
Even countries that have 'survived' the recession are seeing political fragmentation. In Britain nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales are pushing an anti-austerity message and the UK Independence Party is pushing the anti-EU agenda. Centrist politicians of both the left and right are finding that they are left with a core vote holding their noses at the ballot.
There is a huge democratic deficit in Europe in which the old elites are being seen as the people benefitting from an economic crisis they created. 
Inside that prism all kinds of things could happen including the break-up of the EU itself. There are no boundaries right now.

In the UK the Government just increased the public debt mountain. Back in 2008 it was £800 billion and right now it's just on £1.5 trillion. So we basically doubled the national debt because of the recession and a lot of it was buying pointless debt from banks at the book value. 
We also ended up owning 84% of RBS and 54% of Lloyds Banking Group. We bought Northern Rock completely and put all the bad debt into a company owned by the government then we sold all the remaining assets to Richard Branson at a discount who raised the cash from offshore hedge funds and he sent all the profit off to tax havens.
