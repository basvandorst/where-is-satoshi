The equivalent of splitting a stock would be adding more decimal places to the protocol itself.

If everybody expected it to happen eventually, then it was already factored into the price.

Reread the second amendment.
1. A regulated militia is necessary to maintain freedom
2. The right to bear arms is necessary to keep the militia in check

They get obscenely high levels of welfare.  I believe the best solution is to give them a chunk of the Northern Territory and let them secede—they have their own culture, spirituality, preferred means of governance, etc.; they are by all measures a separate nation.  They should be entitled to their own state too.  They have no self-determination as part of Australia.

Welfare still comes in dollars.

Do any of your non-techy friends say "gigabyte" or "millimetre"?

With all due respect, that's a very selfish way of looking at it.  I believe that the blockchain will revolutionize the world.  Even if only used as a currency, it will have a massive impact on poorer countries that don't have strong rule-of-law or private-property protection, helping them to amass capital and more freely trade with each other and with the world.  Significantly increased global propserity will save lives and make countless people happier and healthier, and the earlier the better.
Speeding up the acceptance of cryptocurrencies is a good deed, but not just to ourselves.

Always "zee"; otherwise the song doesn't rhyme.

Bitcoin can and does "iterate".

I switch between the two based on the target of whatever I'm writing.  This probably isn't a big issue for Americans, though.

The whitepaper was marked up in LaTeX, which automatically takes any number of spaces between sentences and turns them into the correct horizontal gap.  The whitepaper thus doesn't reveal anything about its author's spacing style, but his less-formal e-mails, etc. might.

Mobiles and apps, sure, but I don't think anybody can accuse Microsoft of having missed out on the OS market.

Sure they can.  All it takes is a piece of paper that entitles you to one bitcoin.
