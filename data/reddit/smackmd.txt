Could you please tell me how you know that? I'm currently studying CryptoNote and also took a look at Monero. I thought using ring signatures is the core design of Monero.

When you update, the block chain won't be redownloaded.

The Tor software wasn't written by the Navy, they just came up with methods to implement onion routing. Also, DARPA invented the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP), which almost the entire web is based on.

When I have more time I'll have to take a closer look at the insurance part, but the rest of the paper (read a couple of pages) is really good explained. The authors have a realistic perspective on the benefits, dangers and risks that crypto-currencies provide. Very interesting, thank you. It's better than the other shit I read out there.

Bitcoin **IS** beta.

Everything "big" was beta once. That's how projects work. They start out, a alpha/beta version gets released to the public and the developers and their community continue to work until it's fully completed. Not to mention that Bitcoin is (for "just being beta") worldwide used, growing daily, accepted by thousands of businesses, gets a lot of media attention and has a market cap of about 5 billion dollars.

DuckDuckGo has https on their .onion site, too. But again, it unnecessary.
@_date: 2014-10-31 16:35:54
Oh, that's what you meant. Bitcoin uses "[Script]( (a scripting system) for transactions. It's a little complex. Tl;dr; you can use OP_RETURN to add data to a transaction.

Java isn't required to develop an Android app. You can also use C, C++, Python, Rust, etc.

If he'd have just uploaded everything, there would have been a shock for about 3 weeks and nobody would care anymore. But if you release story after story which goes on for years - even if you think it's annoying it will always be somewhere in your head. You hear it over and over again, and that's the point. People should realize it's bad.
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:33:37
Lovely :)

Thank you for taking the time to run a full node!

Since it's beta with a lot of updates rolling, it's not worth it creating a easy installer for every platform. That will come once the software is ready for end-user (out of beta).
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:53:37
Thank you. If I understand correctly, a malicious server cannot steal coins or manipulate transactions, right?

You can send and receive emails within seconds. Postal delivery requires one or more days.


I do all my taxes digitally. I receive ALL my bills via email.


I read bullshit like this every day. Don't blame Reddit for your own nonsense.
 &gt; in fact, your mail server can be configured to wait a full day before sending emails. 
It's almost 2015, nobody uses such providers. When using Gmail, Hotmail/Outlook, Protonmail, Safe-mail, Yahoo, GMX, etc. (aka. every fucking email provider out there) you - as already mentioned - can send and receive emails in seconds. Hell even providers that operate on hidden services ("darknet") achieve that.


You can also ignore letters received by post/fax.
@_date: 2014-11-28 14:16:03
It doesn't have to be that complex. As you said, don't carry around more than you can afford to loose. I'm using Bitcoin on my rooted phone and never had any problems (carrying around $100). As long you don't give root privileges to every fucking app you'll be fine. If you have higher savings in Bitcoin use a paper/hardware wallet.

Do you know how Trezor verifies the firmware update? I mean it's supposed to be secure on compromised computers, so how can you be sure the attacker doesn't replace or infect the firmware?

"It does not make us stronger. If it has, name some ways. What I think that people don't understand is that in times of war, **there's no limit to what Congress and The President can do.** We've been at war since 9/11/2001. Edward Snowden is a criminal." - Ken Hess

[Serious] Could someone explain to me why Electrum requires a server? Is it so you don't have to download the entire block chain?

The article says "submitted by plgonzrx8". Strange. However, welcome to bitcoin!

What differs BitID from other authentication methods?

It's just a mining farm using ASIC chips, it seems. Probably they'll try to sell "contracts" aka. cloud mining where you can buy GHs. As with previous companies, you won't get any ROI and not to mention GHs loose in value by design. As long they don't come up with anything exciting; avoid it.
(Always remember: if those "supercomputers" were that effective, why don't they use it themselves instead of selling it? Because they make more money with that model.)
By the way this is wrong:
"... the process of confirming transactions becomes more complex as the block chain increases."

I like Havelock's method; when resetting 2FA, they contact you via mail and make you sign a message with a private key you used to deposit coins.

Thanks for the response. Anyways, by your description this could be done using public-key crypto - no need for Bitcoin (addresses). This is not supposed to be a hate post, but: Why use Bitcoin for that?
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:33:28
Yeah, that pretty much kills the idea of Bitcoin being easy. That ATM system is just ridiculous.

Rub3x, what the hell are you doing here? I see you in every thread and all you're doing is crying about Bitcoin. If you hate it, why are you so obsessed with it?

You might want to use a light-wallet, for example Electrum. Bitcoin Core uses A LOT of your harddrives space.
