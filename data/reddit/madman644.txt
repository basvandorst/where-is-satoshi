I did and saw with meteoric gains it also came with substantial losses. Sure the trend is up but I'd rather not have a lot of money in something that is going to drop, makes no sense.
I'll just rebuy when it's on a uptrend. 
Also why'd you tell me 27 times lol

Potentially. You could well be right I just don't really know.
My belief is this is a bubble with no real reason for growth to be so high. I also believe that it will reach multifolds higher price in future. 
But just that, in the future. I think we'll see a big drop before we see more big gains and so ideally I've cashed out now and can buy back later. As much as I find the hodl memes amusing, I'd rather play it safer and take a smaller profit than risk having a big position in something that's dropping just because in the long term I think it's likely to go up. 
If that makes sense anyway, I'm just blurting out my thoughts here without much attempt at making it logical.

First bought ~0.5 BTC when it was at $3500 and then cashed out at $4150 after it had come down from $4400. 
So not a huge investment but I don't have much spare money floating around at the moment.
If I'd had ten times the amount I had I would have invested it at $3500 like I did. I more or less emptied my rainy day fund as it is though haha.

I cashed out now. 
Bought more last night right at the peak. Makes me feel silly now but I've locked in a 15% profit since when I invested a few days ago so can't complain really. Could have been double that if I'd cashed out at the right time. Oh well, lesson learnt!

True. No way to know really especially in a market this volatile. I admit I've come into this very half assed, not fully understanding things and certainly not knowledgeable enough to predict anything with any accuracy. 
Honestly my basis for buying was "wow bitcoin is exploding give me some of that" and my basis for selling was "oh shit that's dropping fast let me secure a profit before it tumbles too far down" without any particular thinking beyond this.
From what I see everyone says different things, including supposed experts, so I think no one has a clue what's going to happen and it's all just pure speculation and guesswork.
