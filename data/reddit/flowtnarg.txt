It depends on the difficulty and the number of miners available. I've seen it take 30 seconds to 26 hours. Litecoin is much faster

Lots of people do, use an exchange like Coinbase. The same place you buy them generally

I had extracted some of my bitcoins from my 2011 UN upgrades bitcoin core wallet. The default minimum transaction setting was recommending 0.01 bitcoins

Lots of reasons not to trade bitcoin with strangers. It can be traced, easily and if you get it from a criminal you could be framed or blamed. Going through the exchanges helps prove that you earned it in legit means. In this day and age everything is considered guilty until proven innocent. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:27:24
They should be able to trace it if it doesn't go through  too many hops. If they extract it through an exchange in USD linked to their identity. 
I'm not sure your granted that amount of detection work. But it can be done,

Higher fees do support and incentivize the miners, no? Things will get better

How so? There is only 21 million unit cap, and they cost lots of electricity to make. The dollar has no cap, that can be made unlimited for less than a cent each.

If (1) you have an extra $5K, (2) your electric energy rate isn't too expensive, (3) you can use the heat the miners produce to heat your dwelling, AND (4) you feel the price of bitcoin is going to rise. 
* Also, 16 of the 21 million units in Bitcoin have been mined already and difficulty is increasing, transaction fees and competition may be worth considering. between other systems ... the hardware you buy may outdate faster than you hope for.

Hopefully. It's a favorable move and you don't regret it. Glad your doing well

Yes, I agree node redundancy is good. More remote and geographically separated node locations are more benefit to the system. 
These nodes help relay instant data, faster over shorter distances and offer more data backup security such as in the case of cataclysmic event or government lockout event like China. Getting these nodes to operate over encrypted discreet radio without internet would be extra redundant 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:44:35
Ya that is common sense. Does it mean that all need to be investigated for such activities? Submitted to constant scrutiny and surveillance? Why not just X-ray everything continuously until everything dies of cancer. All In the color of liberty and freedom.

2011 from the silver metals investing YouTube channels. I started mining it /run a node on my CPU as something I did to help the interesting idea grow. Curious to see how it would work out. The heat from running my computer 24/7 was helpful, as I would just be running the electric baseboard heaters more.

Like others said, you trade in bitcoin 1:1, not  based on another currency. Just because the yen goes up or down, doesn't mean Walmart has to pay you more or less US dollars on your return, if you buy in cash you get returns in cash. Likewise with bitcoin.

If you feel that the value will grow, I would hodl. Pay the bills off like you would without this extraordinary investment. Medical bills are charged unfairly, they will not tell you the cost upfront. They make you wait weeks for a outrageous bill full of overcharges.

It's not only you, I think there are many thousands waiting for their bank transfers to clear Coinbase. I also did the same as you on the 4th and I'm still in "pending" many days after my funds clearing the bank. Coinbase has recently taken in over 100000 new clients. 
As soon as my funds are released I'm buying in. I expect this to happen between any minute to Thursday night. Until then I am constantly checking for funds to be available in my usd wallet. Good luck �� 
*Just got in

It's not a blockchain issue, someone had to of got into your account . You can't recover bitcoin, unless you can trace who it was exactly

To mine bitcoins is energy intensive, large amounts of electric current have been consumed to mine, just as mining gold requires energy. Its value is agreed upon by people and scarcity. Both gold and bitcoins are limited in quantity. (Unlike Fiat currency)

Might be a good time to buy a bunch if the "government officials" are not destroying them besides cutting miners power.

Coinbase will take ten + days for your bank debit transaction to process. It's very slow I read. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:37:54
It takes up to ten days for deposit funds to clear. Just plan ahead and fund your cash wallet so you can buy at the dips  of the week
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:59:12
Normally, 25 minutes depending on how many confirmations your exchange requires and what you are paying the miners fee. 
However, in the last BCH attack, it was taking some over several hours to a day to get confirmation. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:55:57
Im predicting the CME will oversell sell fake bitcoin on paper contracts, more units than exist. With that massive collection of funds, the fund managers can manipulate the real supply of Bitcoin with few large buy and sell transactions. Thus "tame prices". The miners or blockchain will not be needed much for this CME system as they will reduce and consolidate transactions into few to none. Maybe this diversion will help reduce network traffic and buy more development time to scale and improve the bitcoins system. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:02:07
I think you want to buy a min of $75 for least fee. Better yet use bank deposit for free

Are you speaking in terms of the lighting network? 
To be honest, many don't care if they are buying petrified dog shit. As long as the market looks right, we are going to rip their faces up, let those bankers come to this Wolf den with their baskets full of money. �� 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:02:09
No I disagree. Forks are modified clones of the original chain. They have a different name and function, operate independently of each other and within their own terms and unique code. Example: Bitcoin is not Bitcoin Cash. Both systems are capped at 21 million units. 
The authors silly argument is equivalent to saying that if you were cloned, your boss could consider you both as a working single employee, paid as such. Your pay would be cut in half, or however you both decided to share it. �� 
The only merit is that as there are more workers, or cryptocurrency types there are, the more competition. it can spread out and reduce some of the demand a bit, things can slow down.

I still have a 'pending' on my cash wallet funding transaction from the 4th. It cleared my bank a few days ago. Normally it's not so long. Might have saved me some $, as bitcoin went on sale, was planning on buying in much higher.

Yup, I noticed that relationship last night too.

You just need to be more patient, anytime I send Coinbase / gdax monies it takes what seems to be a very long time. 
Seven days at minimum on non holiday weeks. I would expect your funds to be available to you on Monday or Tuesday next week.
Coinbase recently took on 300,000 new accounts with new people that have no clue about cryptocurrency, They are busy trying to fix real issues, not responding to typical funds transfer delays as those are probably 99% of the complaints. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:47:14
Many people don't realize you can buy bitcoin in fractions, down to a 0.00000001 BTC, that is, a hundredth of a millionth BTC. 
The smallest unit is called a Satoshi. In the future the increments can go down further if needed. 
example 1 BTC is equivalent to $10,000, therefore 0.25 BTC would be equivalent to $2,500.
Only 21 million BTC will ever exist according to code. When looking at any currency, it is important to know If there is a cap or if they can be made in an unlimited amount. The US dollar and many other currencies are made in unlimited amounts, which if you store your wealth in it, its equivalent to stealing from you every time they "print more".  
*The only way printing would not be a problem, is if the printers issued a fair amount dollars directly to holders to compensate the dilution. However, they go into pockets of Napoleons (Animal Farm) for the most part.

Yes, the system is lacking the technology to trade portably and offline. An offline trading app that syncs &amp; confirms to the blockchain when connected  to a network is required.
Trading in cash person to person is simple, no internet required. Satellite and radio access would add redundancy. No reason one should not be able to transact if there is a local internet outage or bad cell phone service.

Trading tangible mass produced items like paper, coin fiat or goods are the most difficult to trace.

@_date: 2017-11-15 19:20:49
The unconfined transactions were all time high over 200,000 fee days ago, down to 70k and many of them I suspect are transactions with too low of miner fees for them to be taken on. My transactions are now rapid, less than a hour for sure

Most negative; Bin Laden is found alive, and the price of silver, shoots back up (as it tanked down the minute he was announced dead). Bitcoin is traded off for silver as it climbs in parity with gold. 
Most positive: The Clintons and corrupt network hide billions of corrupt money into BTC before they are jailed. Prices go to moon and money is returned to the people.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:45:09
The value increases as the units are lost. With eight decimals, this will account for many years. Consider 1 cent equivalent to 0.00000001. That will allow many years of use as the price of bitcoin would have to be  $1,000,000. Which a very -huge-market cap

There was a news article out yesterday about china cutting electric power to miners. The electric power companies are all becoming under more centralized control and to "save" power they are banning mining. The miners in this article were claiming that the power they use is all from hydro electric dams and in available in excess. To me the article appeared to support that there was more governmental crypto banning measures in effect.
