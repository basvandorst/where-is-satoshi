It worked for 5 minutes: then the bitcoins i had in there just vanished over a transaction i never authorized/did. Im not sure if they were sent back to the original wallet, but if that's the case, they're lost completely probably. 
Over 850$ just..vanished in front of my eyes.

Got it from 
Version 3.3.8
The transaction ids are:
1) 42869e7e4fe17883e80e0ed496addfaa1e031f6d4f05676d491ef7823e2e878d
and 2)
It's weird, because i have another wallet on the Electrum with 40$ and that one wasn't touched at all

Here, i verified the file with Kleopatra; it isn't a malware, it comes straight from the official website
I haven't found anything to reconnect in the menu; not sure if im looking at the right stuff

Both of the wallets where the BTC were just return "[]" when i write that command in console

All i got was "Traceback (most recent call last):" for both of them =(

I've tried, but it seems like i don't have any of those wallet addresses there on Electrum 
I have a default one with segwit addressess that look similiar, but i've used the search function and none of those two showed up
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:21:41
Nevermind; got "false" for both of them
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:25:34
Yes sorry, my bad; i wasn't inserting the quotes. They both returned as "false" by the way. 
How do i reconnect?

Im in bed at the moment; i wasted the whole day on this, i physically can't stand up anymore without feeling sick; i'll try to verify (with Kleopatra?) in a few hours when i'll wake up. Im sure i've downloaded it from the website i linked, which should be the official one. I've checked each one of my wallets with the console by the way; i'll try reconnecting. I just hope i can get those back(i doubt it at this point), i needed them for my meds

Yes, exactly: the address doesn't look like a bitcoin address though. 
Also, i have another wallet with 40$, always on Electrum, but that one wasn't sweeped away like those two. 
I do have both txids: one is 
and the other one is
