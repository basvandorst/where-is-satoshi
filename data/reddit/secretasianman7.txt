I hope you're right, the thing is though, banks and governments livelihood is literally at stake here, and they will do everything in their power to keep themselves alive, because that's what these kinds of institutions do.  I just don't want to underestimate the power of government.  They are the most powerful entities on earth and they will stop at nothing to make sure that they get to keep their place on the food chain.  I wanna start conversations like this one in order to try and stay on top of them.  When a wild animal is backed into a corner, you can bet they will lash out.

Maybe.  As far as we know the age of the universe could be incredibly young in the grand scheme of things.  The only thing we have to compare it to is the lifespan of the average human.  Also that theory could go out the window if faster than light travel is or will ever be a feasible technology

So you have such a wide ranging grasp of what is real and not real across the entire universe and all of its thousands of trillions of galaxies that you can definitively say that aliens don't exist?

I would change fiat to dollars.  Not sure the general public even understands what fiat is...
