You should never be using market order anyway. Bitmex makes their fee structure and how they work transparent, blame the users for losing what they have, they should know full well the risks of the platform they use along with all the caveats of it. 
The gambler blaming the casino for losing is always hilarious.

So this chart is basically saying that we're below the mean and due for an upswing to it probably soon, nice.

Crashing this market, with no survivors
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:12:45
Starting to believe that we actually will fully capitulate in the next few weeks and end up wicking just under 3k, to start a session of flat accumulation in the 3-4k range. It seems obvious we're going to smack into 5.8 again, and I doubt it's holding this time with how fearful this 3rd massive drop has made everyone.   
I managed to get a huge short in at 7066, so I'm happy and carefully moving my stop lower into profit, so I'm cool with this and should be set for the next cycle. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 13:42:32
Am I the only one that thinks charts like this don't make sense? The crash of 2014 was entirely caused by Mt. Gox, a black swan event. It wasn't natural movement, and while a correction was required from that rise, if Mt. Gox never went down you can bet your ass the chart wouldn't look like that today. 
This space is completely driven by news and hype cycles. It's completely stupid to try and say because a chart did something in the past, means it'll follow that same path today, when the reason it did something in the past was due to news and events.

Are you seriously comparing bitcoin to the stock market in any way besides the fact that there are small groups of speculators attempting to apply TA to it? Market size is the major factor in terms of how reliable TA is, because it requires more people reacting a certain way to actually cause big moves to happen. 
Bitcoin is small, and filled with whales that control a majority of the supply. The other half of people in bitcoin are """investors""" that take TA and panic buy and sell acting like they're pros. You cannot, reliably use anything in Bitcoin's history to predict the future, as we haven't yet hit the stage where it's big enough to create a good frame of reference. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:14:58
I feel the recovery will happen around then. For the next month or two though, we're capitulating from fear. I can easily see us start to rise again on speculation on usage increasing thanks to Bakkt if it seems it's still set to open in Nov. If everything goes well with that, it could be the start of the next cycle. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 17:57:51
You...realize that the lines were drawn like this afterwards, right? Like someone didn't start drawing this when bitcoin was created and said it should follow this path. TA is using hindsight to try and predict future market psychology which doesn't hold up in a small market controlled by news.

They've had access for years. I'm not sure why people keep thinking that they're all waiting for like a door to be unlocked or something like that. Coinbase had to close their index fund project down because of a lack of interest. These headlines are pure hopium. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:43:54
I feel like because everyone is expecting Bakkt to cause a new bullrun, it won't. Why hasn't the price been rising consistently ever since the announcement then? I think Bakkt is going to release, and then nothing continues to happen or we still go flat, because the demand won't come until some sort of financial crisis, or other huge event that makes people everywhere say   
"Oh wow I need to get bitcoin"
The speculation phase causing huge bullruns is over for a long while. There needs to be an actual reason for people to need it. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 20:25:15
Honestly, the fact that everyone is now assuming Bakkt is going to start the next bullrun makes me very skeptical that it'll actually do just that. You would think it'd start going up with all the anticipation for it in advance. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 20:48:20
The actual bait is the drop from 4.7k to 3k. We'll wick hard and trade between 5-6k until the next bullrun. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:33:24
Except descending triangles break to the downside most often. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:24:36
We are near the bottom. You'll also find that opinion varies wildly about how far down or high Bitcoin "should" be at this time, and how close we currently are to it. Some people think it's going back down to 4k, others see this as the current bottom based on TA (which I agree with).
Do not try to time the bottom and sell the top. What you should do, is only buy when you see it's dipped by a good amount, and only sell when you see it's gone up by a good amount, and never go all in with a buy or a sell. There are plenty of traders here that mistake investing for gambling and go all\-in. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 13:36:56
That sucks, but I share the same opinion as others have already stated: who in their right mind would even keep over $1,000,000 worth of bitcoin on an exchange. If you believe in the future of it at all, you should realize that you're already set for life, and at the most just need to wait.   
I hope you're able to get some of it back, but jesus christ dude, let this be a lesson in greed.

I didn't know that the greatest store of value in the world would lose 75%+ of its value within a year. The bar must be really low then?
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:57:29
Somebody sounds like a delusional bagholder that needs a constant flow of positive news to keep them from admitting they should have sold early this year.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:15:26
I think this entire shitstorm should have been expected. None of the big names behind bcash would give up without literally trying to tank everything else before they admit defeat. The complete death of a big name crypto would obvious cause massive waves, but this had to happen.   
In order to actually recover, the infighting about who's bitcoin is the "real" bitcoin, needs to end, one way or the other. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:13:33
Right, but the people that sold at any other time this year now have the ability to get far more because they had the foresight to know that this entire year, and maybe for some time moving forwards, the hype bubble's been deflating.   
If you hold something 80% down, congrats, the people that bought in at 80% down are now in a much better position than you. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:11:53

How does it look like anxiety on any timeframe? The chart here is a linear one. On any linear timeframe it seems to match right where depression is. Daily and Weekly mainly.
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:46:32
The downtrend is broken though. It was going flat before this pump, and now that the pump happened the worst that's going to happen is we'll retrace t 6.5k and bounce between here and there for a while before the curve upwards. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 13:58:07
So many people do this it's embarrassing. It would have some weight if it was a science you could study, or a math with a proof of a theorem that has objectively correct solutions, but it's not. You're just using multiple indicators to get the best guess as to what'll happen. 
People who say "I told you so" when probability is involved are dumbasses. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 13:54:35
Congrats you got lucky. I love how the markets show the hubris of people that got a few predictions right out of hundreds and start saying "I told you so, you should have listened to me". 
I guess people with confidence issues need to do this to feel superior to others, but even when I do something right, I don't go around saying "Told you if you just listened to me you would be good." because even with the best TA and judgment, you can be wrong. It's not a fucking science lol.

Because in order for people to sell they need to sell into lower and lower buy orders because people want to sell more than they want to buy. The price dips because people aren't willing to buy at the current price, but maybe $200 down. Sellers will go that far down to get rid of their stock, and the price keeps dipping because of how low they're willing to go.

Anger if we're going by the general matchup to the wall st chart was the april fall to 6.3k. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 19:18:03
...Yeah...and the level of the dip for anger was below the candle body from the February dump. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:39:44
Right but the point is that both the sentiment and pattern matches now, as opposed to just what people were saying to try and influence it.
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:14:41
1.) But the previous low based on the position on the chart would be the April dip, which was about 6.4k
2.) The significant drop was the breach of 5.8k, with the rally being the run up to 6.8k this past week. 
3.) Can't argue with that. 
4.) Can't argue with that.

Can you show me on what linear timeframe (since the above chart is), shows that we match up with denial?
@_date: 2018-07-11 14:01:22
See I would think this if the Bitcoins were going to random people off the street, but they'll be going back to individuals that have most likely continued to follow the market, and are maybe even still participating in it. I highly, highly doubt that there's going to be a mass sell wave if those people have any sense at all. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 17:36:58
Thank you for providing an actual chart with your claims. Looking at it this way I can understand the people saying we still have more to fall, and it's quite possible we do. 
Although I'm looking at the market cycle comparison not 100% literally, but just in general, such as "This hump is smaller than the one that came before it, while on the same trajectory". I do not believe it should be taken literally, but if you look at it in terms of slopes, that's what it seems to be matching. 
I feel like we are at depression honestly. There's been 7 months of bear market, and the majority of people that bought the giant run-up are feeling the burn. Nobody talks about crypto anymore--nobody wants to, and I'm constantly seeing people giving up now and saying we're crashing to 3k. 
The current sentiment just seems to have all the hallmarks of depression if you look outside of the direct crypto community bubble, and look around in the media and with people you know, since they're the ones that caused the excitement and bull run in the first place. 
Edit: One other thing--after every bullrun, Bitcoin always finds a new floor higher than before the run. If we actually did go back to 2k or sub 1k, it would go against its entire history of boom/bust cycles. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 03:43:12
You’re also stupid lol the bottom was 5.8k
@_date: 2018-07-11 13:40:50
I see so many people actually stating that it's never going to reach ATH again, which is hilarious because while they believe in going with the trend of the market, they're actually going against it in the long run. 
I'm not sure if it's all December buyers or what. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 19:31:55
Thanks to everyone that commented on this thread. 
You've given me confidence in my long at 6.3k considering the majority here, and elsewhere seem to agree that we're going to still dip hard under 5k, or otherwise randomly say we're at another point on the chart because they just "feel like" it's there. This was an additional sentiment analysis. See you guys at 10k EoM.

Do you think it’s possible that the only reason the chart has matched up so eerily with this meme chart is because of how small the space is letting whales literally paint it?

I don't know if you're just being sarcastic, but that's such a stupid statement.
1 USD is always equal to 1 USD
1 Rupee is always equal to 1 Rupee
What changes is how much buying power 1 of anything gets you. Saying 1 BTC = 1 BTC means nothing because it goes against what you said before that, about how it's supposed to bring down the central banking system by becoming the new world currency, but all currencies are valued in how much one unit of it can get you. There is literally no purpose to it other than spending it, or holding it hoping it goes up higher so you have more spending power. 
1 BTC always being equal to 1 BTC is such a meaningless statement, and is indicative of someone that doesn't understand core concepts of value. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 22:16:42

Yes, the wick dipped below 6k, but whenever you do chart analysis on a timeframe you look at what it closed at, not what a flash dump went to before recovering 5 minutes later. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 17:08:11
It certainly is possible if the ETF gets approved in August. I think people have witnessed a bear market for so long that many forget just how quickly BTC can run in the opposite direction as well. If we do start to genuinely go up again, the breach of 10k will get mass coverage, while a breach of 20k will see a drastic climb up, as breaking the ATH would likely cause intense FOMO with everyone that sold during the bear market.   
It's a possibility. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:32:25
Actually yes it makes sense but it doesn’t mean anything.

@_date: 2018-07-11 13:48:55
Looking at the daily it seems clear to me that the downtrend was broken with that week of climbing. Chances are higher we flatline in this range for another few weeks before starting the curve upwards. The trend of higher highs and lower lows ended with the 5.8k rejections. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:01:53
But that doesn't match up. That point is above the previous low, and we're clearly below the previous dip back in April.
