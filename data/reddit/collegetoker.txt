I'm not sure I'd expect bitcoin to fall to 50 and come back.  I think if bitcoin's value ever go into the double digits without some sort of organic decline, it's safe to say that we had seen the last of bitcoin.

In a way, he's kinda right.  There either needs to be a universal wallet that is able to accept the transfers of all of these new altcoins or a standard must be chosen.  Though competition is good for a market, too many options creates white noise, leading to a division of the crypto currency users and inhibiting success.

What are the chances that a 3-letter agencies is behind this?

Jim Cramer, is that you?

As long as bitcoin can weather these occasional storms, the price will probably stabilize pretty high.

At least back up at 640$, I'd venture to imagine more.

market capitulation implies that the consumer has lost confidence in a commodity. It's good for investment, but bad for a currency.

I'm not going to say that you are wrong, but it would be very disappointing if true.

Any market data to back this or just a hunch?
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:27:02
I'm not really concerned, more curious really.  It seems like a lot of things behind the scenes affect bitcoin price, including regulation, corporate interest, chart speculation, trading bots attempting to manipulate prices, etc.

With all of the government in tor recently, both US and Russian alike, it makes you wonder.  Then again, the ip suggests the node is located in Germany.

Couldn't you apply a similar mechanism to break a wallet that you would share a block in a mining pool, essentially creating a decentralized brute force cloud application to generate the private key/ figure out the password?

I agree with a lot of libertarian ideals, but the community here needs to be able to separate political ideology from a new modality of currency transfer.  In truth, bitcoin as a whole needs a better marketing department.  It needs to find a niche and grow expand past it, and in a lot of ways, the hardcore users who are doing this as a means of political dissent need to compromise to a degree (at least temporarily) to ensure mainstream success.  Users are what keeps bitcoin alive, without them it's just another worthless cryptocurrency kicking around the reaches of the internet.
In short, there needs to be a representative bitcoin body that delegates ideas and markets out the bitcoin as an alternative to prepaid visas (or at least in the beginning) to increase usability and versatility and encourage more businesses to use it, from movie theaters to gas stations.  The more places that you can spend it, the less likely that you are to dump the currency, helping it gain traction.
  Once that were to gain momentum, we might have a chance in being adopted into the google wallet/ apple pay mechanism and insidiously usurp the central banks.

I think it's safe to say that the average decision made while inebriated on alcohol ranges from neutral to detrimental.  But I agree that a lot of positive discoveries and ideations have been done under the influence of substances.
