The hostility comes from you telling them things that are contrary their view of the world. When you tell them something that shakes their belief in the system that has brainwashed them for so long it creates strong cognitive dissonance ([wiki]( It feels bad and realizing your whole worldview is a lie feels worse.
This year we're going to get a global slap in the face with reality. If you want to help people see the truth, concentrate on people who are already on the brink of awakening or beginning to suspect that everything is not like it seems. Everyone is going to wake up when it all comes down but for some it's gonna hit like a ton of bricks because they weren't prepared.

Lets change this a bit.
I was talking to my friend about **cash** and his ignorance surprised me. He told me that it's known for being used in purchasing drugs, porn, etc, and laughed at me for being "naive" and asked if I was a "pedo". While I'm aware of the darker side I know there's more to **cash** and understand it's importance.

Bitcoins are like gold bars. Ultimately the person who holds them physically is the owner. There can be papers and agreements that you have this and this much in our vault but that vault can be broken into and your gold or btc gets stolen. Being security conscious is very important. Physically own your private addresses, only then do you truly own your bitcoin.
The abandonment of the banking system leaves all responsibility to the owner, which is a double edged sword. No body has access to your bitcoin but at the same time you hold all the responsibility of keeping it safe.

See the thing is bitcoin is HUGELY MASSIVELY undervalued for what it truly is and will become. Bitcoin right now is a teeny tiny baby monetary system / asset taking its first teeny tiny baby steps. Bitcoin is less than a decade old. The british pound has been in use for a thousand years.
When bitcoin matures, owning one whole bitcoin will make you rich. The time of buying cheap bitcoins is coming to an end this year. The fiat currencies are racing to the bottom and that spells the end of the debt based economy. We're entering a new era.

Btc goes up up up. There will be volatility and huge swings but the trend will be up for a long time. Just simply because all the fiats are racing to the bottom. Once the derivatives start failing, the whole monetary system will fail and all the smart money will pour into precious metals and bitcoin.

Cash is being banned in the hopes that if they can roll it out fast enough, people won't be able to do bank runs when shit hits the fan. The big criminal organizations use banks to launder their money. The cash ban has nothing to do with criminality / money laundering in reality. It's just an excuse.
Bitcoin can't be banned, Bitcoin can't be stopped. The only way to end Bitcoin is the collective destruction of humanity.

That sucks but you can find solace in the fact that if you have more than 1 btc, in a few years you can retire on that. At $1250, btc is almost free.

I'm not saying bitcoin will be the cause of the fiat system breaking down. It's already happening and can't be stopped. It's how the system was designed. All I'm saying is that when the system does go down, bitcoin and precious metals are going to skyrocket because people will be desperate to get their wealth outside the debt paper system.

It's not the same. In fiat, central banks can manipulate for free since they can just print money. To manipulate btc you have to actually spend the btc. It costs real money to manipulate.

That's close but not quite because inflation doesn't show itself uniformly. For some time we've had what you could call hyperinflation, but only in the financial sector. The financial sector has grown immensely from QE and all equity valuations are through the roof. In other words value is being sucked from all of the FIAT currencies and directed in to financial institutions. That's your crash.

Well for one you're saying it should be illegal for people to trade bitcoin for fiat. Doesn't really help bitcoin or anything else for that matter. If people can trade, they will try to game the system to their advantage. It's simple as that. When market cap increases, volatility decreases. For several years there will still be days when btc/usd will swing tens of percents. It's natural.
Another point is saying bitcoin is never "going to the moon". It's a mathematical inevitability, not chance, not nothing. It's going to happen. Simply from fiat currencies failing. Add network effect to that. When fiats hit hyperinflation phase, nominal btc value goes through the roof.

Not quite. The value of bitcoin comes from mining. Similarly the value of gold comes from mining (the other kind). How much we value it in terms of fiat is set by the market place. Being finite, it retains value, since it can't be printed like fiat. That is the essential difference between fiat currency and sound money. Dollars, Euros and Yens etc being fiat currency and gold, silver, btc being sound money.
As an example: if mining one bitcoin costs $100 in electricity, miners won't sell that one bitcoin for less than that, since it's not profitable. So a baseline has been set for the price of btc. If two people want to buy that one bitcoin and one will pay $150 and the other will play $200, the market action has set a price according to demand to $200.
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:54:34

Depends how much we're talking. If we're talking less than $10k I'd trade your local currency for physical USD at a bank that does foreign exchange. I wouldn't get USD if it's not your local currency and you don't plan on spending it soon though. Or any other fiat for that matter.

Okay. You are aware that economics has a whole branch dedicated to the theory of value? 
[Adam Smith and Labour theory of value](










I reiterate. The value of bitcoin is produced by the miners at cost of electricity and labour. It is exchanged by users at a price set by markets through supply and demand.
The properties of bitcoin make it money. They don't give it value. (Medium of exchange, a unit of account, portable, durable, divisible, fungible, store of value.)

@_date: 2016-12-18 15:34:02
I think you're the one confusing the two.
Value is derived from labour. Hence value added tax. When you improve something via labour you increase its value which is then taxed.
If labour and value weren't connected, why would anyone pay you to work? You produce value with your labour.
