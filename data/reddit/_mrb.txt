I did not write "Asicboost" anywhere in my comment. My comment isn't about Asicboost, but about empty blocks.

False. It's 24% (26 out of 105) and is statistically expected to be 18% (their hashrate share): 


False: fees are completely unaffected by an **insignificant** difference of 0 vs 0.75% of empty blocks. In fact the miner of an empty block loses significant profit has he loses $50,000 (4 BTC) in tx fees per block

AntPool is the first pool people usually try. Once they gain experience with it, they may move to other pools, but then they are no longer neophyte. "Impossible" you said? Apparently logical reasoning isn't your forte.


That statement applies to you as well.
Fun fact: Bitmain's doesn't even have a gigantic market share as conspiracy theorists like you think they do. Remember Bitmain's heavily publicized Ordos mine? It's only ~260 PH/s or 1.6% of the global hashrate. Remember Bitmain's plan to build the largest data center in the world at 150 MW ( Full of S9s mining exclusively Bitcoin (which we know isn't true because Bitmain also mines Litecoins, BCH, etc) it would only represent 9% of the global hashrate.
But empty blocks are also caused by other reasons than users mining stale empty blocks for longer than they should. Pools simply have more or less optimized systems to verify &amp; broadcast blocks. Not all pools are equal in this respect. Fun fact: Antpool has in fact made improvements to reduce the rate of empty blocks in the past:  (which by the way is a nice summary of how the rate of empty blocks was able to be reduced... educate yourself by reading it).


You apparently don't know how covert AB works. These empty blocks have **nothing** to do with AB, because you typically want at least *some* transactions in the block to claim the fees and you can shuffle merkle branches to be able to create merkle roots colliding on the last 32 bits. Covert AsciBoost simply can't work efficiently with empty blocks like the ones reported as the miner missed out on all the tx fees (  
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:30:07
Miners aren't doing "nothing". Solving the SHA256 challenge for an empty block is as much work as for a full block. In both cases you are hashing a merkle root. Source: I know what I'm talking about—I wrote hdminer—also see

As a Bitcoiner since 2010 (I started by developing hdminer, co-founded mining system integrator Thin Air Ventures, etc), I've seen and lived through all community conflicts since then. And my opinion is that Jihan and Bitmain are *bullied* by the community. It's a poisonous aspect of the community that I want to address. So, yes, you will see me often defending them. That said, having a different opinion makes me neither a "shill", nor a Bitmain "fanboy" (I have multiple points on which I could criticize Bitmain.)
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:01:56
100% agree. I once demonstrated a full node supporting 2-4MB blocks has operational costs of only 5 bucks per month: 
5 bucks per month doesn't hurt decentralization.
Heck, $5 is a mere fraction of just one average transaction fee.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:23:57
This has been explained countless of times:
Basically when a stratum mining client fetches a job right after a blk was broadcasted (but before the pool could validate it &amp; fully build the next blk) the pool MUST return a job for an empty blk.
The percentage of empty blocks is very small. Only 1.30% of blocks by Antpool are empty. The global average is 0.75%:  It's a tad higher for Antpool because as the largest most popular pool, they attract a bunch of neophyte miners who tend to be flakier than the average miner (eg. haven't tuned their mining op to be as reliable as possible, mine on wifi instead of GbE, don't yet have scripts to monitor and reboot stuck ASICs, etc), and these users may mine empty stale jobs for longer than normal.
(Don't listen to group propaganda who wants you to believe there is a secret evil purpose behind Antpool mining a tiny number of empty blocks. Or just apply common sense: if they wanted empty blocks they would mine a lot more than 1%... )
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:19:13
You seem ignorant of costs (even non-bulk) around the most of the world.
Example: a person spends $40/mo on uncapped home Internet access (typical of China/Japan/Europe ISP markets). She runs a full node that uses 150GB/mo (mostly outbound, average of 0.5 Mbit/s). That's 5% of her upload bandwidth, so a node represents $2/mo in network costs. She runs the node on her desktop computer ($600, 3-year life) and estimates the node consumes 10% of her hw CPU/RAM/storage resources. $60 spreads over 3 years, that's $1.67/mo in hardware costs. Total net + hw costs = **$3.67/mo**. ISP market prices in *some* American regions are more expensive than China/Japan/Europe so round this up to $5/mo for American full node operators.
If at 5 bucks per month you tell me 2-4MB blocks will totally centralize Bitcoin, you are not a rational person presenting evidence based on **facts and data** but you are spreading FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:34:29
* Larger blocks facilitate UTXO consolidation (by decreasing tx fees).
* Oⁿ network bandwith is absolutely manageable for a **one-time** modest block increase (2× or 4×) and some services like [Blockstream 
satellite]( would make it practically a non-issue (if they agreed to up the bandwidth for larger blocks :-P)
* "Premature (pre optimized) blockchain bloat" is the only legitimate element in your list, but as I said the bloat costs only 5 dollars per month.
* Node operation on home internet: is a non-issue for most. Per my blog 1MB blocks consume 100-300GB per month. With 4MB blocks you could cap it (using bitcoin.conf:maxuploadtarget) to 100-400GB with little consequences. I know some users are heavily capped by their ISP, but most users aren't.
* The rest of your bullet points are legitimate concerns, but are not "scalability" issues. My comment above you was meant only as a response to the "pile of scalability concerns" claim.

@_date: 2018-01-18 19:25:31
I see that pointing out you were dodging the question "triggered" you. But I have to say you dodged the question again... I have to ask a 6th time(!):
**It makes zero sense for Bitmain to be "using covert AsicBoost with empty blocks for greed" currently (not years ago, but today) because it would mean they are in fact loosing money by missing out on 30% of txn fees while insufficiently gaining only 20% in speed. What do you have to say about it?**
I predict you are going to dodge this question one more time.
Let me tell you what I think. I think you are dodging because you have so much ego that you won't admit you were wrong. You won't admit your little conspiracy theory of Bitmain **currently** (not years ago, but today) exploiting covert Asicboost with empty blocks is falling apart.
Answers to your other ramblings/lies/misunderstandings:
* Jihan is not "behind covert AsicBoost". You make it sound like he invented it. It's a generic algorithmic shortcut that they and many others discovered in Bitcoin mining. 4 distinct groups, including Bitmain, have patented it.
* Jihan is behind AntBleed. However this has nothing to do with the topic of this discussion (empty blocks and AsicBoost).
* You ask me why Jihan (1) gave up 20-30% profits to (2) stall Bitcoin's development, but I believe neither (1) nor (2). And nowhere do I imply that I believe in (1) or (2).
* You claim I lied about "Antpool having a much higher rate of empty blocks in the past"? I never lied about this. I agree with this fact. In this thread I've only been talking about the **current** (not years ago, but today) rate of empty blocks which is 1.3%.
* You claim I lied about the reason Bitmain rose to dominate the mining market? I never lied about this. I never claimed any reason why they came to dominate the market.
* You claim I lied by implying Bitmain were using covert AsicBoost only after segwit? I never implied this. Again, in this thread I've only been talking about the current rate of empty blocks which indicates that **currently** (not years ago, but today) it's implausible that they mine empty blocks specifically to leverage covert AsicBoost.
Jihan denies having been able to use AsicBoost, and I believe him because if he had been successful in leveraging it, he would be proud about it and even boast about it. Why would he hide it? They are 1 of the 4 companies who patended it. Proving they can profit from their intellectual property would be a huge advantage and would help them raise more VC money, etc.
I refuse to return your 4-letter insults back to you. I won't lower myself to your level (even though I don't think much about you.)

If everyone in the Bitcoin industry is your enemy, then **you** are the enemy of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-01-20 04:01:20


Finally, you answered! Only took me asking **6 times in a row**... Unfortunately, you are wrong. As I already pointed out to you [there]( the AsicBoost whitepaper itself explains the increase is only 20%. Here is the link again:  Read the first sentence of the abstract. I'll paste it here for you: **"AsicBoost is a method to speed up Bitcoin mining by a factor of approximately 20%."**
I'm sorry, the thread is over. I hope you've learned a lesson. When you have to resort to claim that 20% is 2000% to justify your little conspiracy theory, not only you've demonstrated it is a nonsensical conspiracy theory, but you've made a fool of yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:59:15
The "pile of scalability concerns" is over exaggerated by people who have never looked into the factual numbers. The amortized cost of running a full node with 4MB blocks is only [5 dollars per month]( It's less than a typical txn fee ([7 usd](
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:55:36
This is now the 4th time I explain it: AsicBoost with empty blocks is not worthwhile because it is less profitable than mining blocks full of transaction fees. The boost AB can bring is ~20%. By comparison tx fees add ~30%. **Therefore loosing 30% in fees for gaining 20% in speed does not make sense as a miner using AB will make less than a miner not using AB.**

So you stopped using Coinbase because (1) the CEO liked one tweet, (2) you believe the insider trading conspiracy theories which have been debunked many times, and (3) it turns out that, well, one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges isn't as agile from a software development standpoint as you would like it to be?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:11:23
Jihan supports larger blocks because he believes this will maximize Bitcoin's chances of success &amp; price. He has explained this many, many times. In fact, big blockers such as him argue that Core is responsible for hampering Bitcoin's success, and the price would be higher if Core hadn't stubbornly refused to increase the block weight limit. You may or may not agree with Jihan, but with respect to the block size debate, there is a logic that's at least self-consistent behind his position.
But that's not your case. There are inconsistencies behind your arguments. You dodged the point disproving your little conspiracy theory. So I'll ask again a 5th time: loosing 30% in fees by mining empty blocks for gaining 20% in speed by using AsicBoost means a **miner will make less money**. So why again would "greedy" Bitmain be using AsicBoost?
Don't dodge the question again.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:24:07
A miner would get **more** per non-empty blk: 17 BTC instead of 12.5 BTC.
But I think you didn't understand my point:
You are claiming that if empty blocks were no more, the network transactional capacity would jump by 0.75%, so Bitcoin would process not ~300,000 txs but 302,250 txs per day, and that this would eliminate high fees. This is false. A difference between 300,000 and 302,250 is **insignificant** and would not change the fee market whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:27:46
The beauty of a block weight increase is that end-users don't have to do anything. 100% of end-users would instantly and automatically benefit from the transactional capacity increase.
With Segwit, *everyone* suffers if *some* users drag their feet or delay upgrading to Segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:05:29
We are witnessing the direct result of Bitcoin Core developers who have, so far, staunchly refused to increase the block weight limit. We need [an increase]( especially because the demand for on-chain transactions will increase (the creation of one Lightning channel requires one on-chain txn.)


@_date: 2018-01-12 23:03:46


None of the numbers/facts you reported disproves **any** of my claims. Do you understand the **insignificance** of what you reported? Over a 3 months period, out of the 2500+ blocks mined by Antpool, they mined 6 (six) more empty blocks than what was statistically expected. But somehow you build up a giant conspiracy theory on these 6 (six) extra empty blocks... Ooooh. Six blocks out of two thousand five hundred. Clearly they are so evil /s... And explain to me again why, by losing 6 × $50,000 = $300,000 in tx fees, would this validate your conspiracy theory that AntPool is mining empty blocks for... greed? Huh? I thought greed was about making money, not losing it? Oh that's right. Logic isn't your forte.


You understand neither these experts, nor me. What they and I are telling you is that there is a crucial difference between **near empty** blocks (which may indicate covert AB) and **empty** blocks (which don't indicate covert AB). The blocks reported by are empty. Not near empty. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:02:35
Yeah! Nobody needs people who **use** Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:59:51
I'll keep my reply short to focus on the one very simple point which you still fail to grasp. (The root cause of why you believe in your little conspiracy theory.)


It *can* but it doesn't *have* to. It's not in the miner's interest as he would miss out on all the transaction fees which add up to 4 BTC / $50k per block. This is the 3rd time I explain it. Again, the tx fees are so high that there is no reason for a miner to not take them given there are multiple known efficient ways to include txs while using covert AB.

Even in the beginning of Bitcoin's history (2010) it was obvious to most bitcoiners that the technology had a huge potential. I remember distinctively feeling that the BTC I was mining back when it was worth $0.25 could become extremely valuable in the future, so I was selling only half of what I mined and kept the rest.

You could always email Andy Greenberg or the Juola &amp; Associates guys to confirm beyond doubt whether they ran the analysis against Szabo or not.

1. Wrong. Your Forbes article looked at Dorian Nakamoto's writing, not Szabo's (how could you misread/misunderstand this?!) Research done on Szabo's writing has, on the contrary, concluded it is strikingly similar to Satoshi's writing: 
2. It is a very minor detail, possibly done intentionally.
3. Wrong. Szabo's own resume claims he knows and worked at jobs requiring C++. See ftp://szabo.best.vwh.net/old/netcom.0696.tar.gz in the resumes/* files ("PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES:  * C/C++, Perl, Tcl/Tk, Java, SQL, Lisp, Smalltalk, various assembly")
4. When you create an anonymous identity on purpose, you only talk about the strict minimum. The more you talk about topics that are not really relevant to your goal (starting Bitcoin), the more you expose your ideas and risk your true identity to be discovered.
5. The Szabo's paper was written 10 years before Satoshi's comment (1999 vs 2009). It would be normal that his opinion changes after discovering how to make bitcoin possible / ways to make micropayments easier.
6. It is obvious Satoshi is very articulate, contrary to his claim. He said that to be modest. Either way "Satoshi said X, therefore he cannot be Szabo" is not a convincing argument as we should expect him to say things to disassociate himself from his true personality.

Look, I support Segwit and I support a block size increase. I think both should take place.
But my point is that Core's actions are dictatorial-ish when it comes to *strongly* refusing a block size increase. And let's be clear: when I say "Core" I don't refer only to the Core developers, but to the Core community as a whole, to the people supporting and siding with Core developers.
The Core developers themselves are not actually the ones censoring discussions on r/Bitcoin but the Core community (theymos, etc) are the ones who censor this subreddit in order to strongly enforce their views and ideas (against block size increases) on the readers here.

Empty blocks happen when a pool client fetches a job right after the pool received a new block, but before the pool could validate all transactions in it (it's a window of a few hundred milliseconds typically), therefore the pool doesn't know which *remaining* mempool transactions can be included in the mining job to return to the client:

It's not true that demand for internet bandwidth is higher than capacity. I worked at Google if you looked at our bandwidth charts at pretty much all data centers, it looked like a sinusoidal with a 24-h period (with peaks between 50-90% of bandwidth limit and dips below 50%).
And that's the opposite of what we are seeing on this chart where the block size flatlined:  This is a sign of congestion. Even the segwit weight chart shows congestion: 
You don't even have to look at these charts to see congestion. The mere facts the average tx fee is $3 **implies** congestion, or else it would be at $0.15 like last year:

(Let me preface by saying **I love your detailed answer and your effort to keep the debate intellectual and constructive**. This is how should be.)
I've never understood the "them" (miners &amp; businesses) vs "us" (users) viewpoint. **Miners &amp; businesses are us**. The founders of these companies are us. They are users, like you and I, who believe in Bitcoin so much that they founded companies to participate in and grow the ecosystem.
The NYA wasn't a completely closed-door meeting. Some (many?) Core devs were invited, but they refused to come...
I am **baffled** why so many see segwit2x/NYA as evil. It is my honest opinion that a few persons who really disliked the NYA started spreading exaggerations and misconceptions ("us vs them", "closed door meeting", "evil businesses") which were repeated over and over in and it ended up convincing many that NYA really was evil.
At least that's my best theory.
I see many segwit2x opponents who seem angry and upset about the divide. But that is not how I feel at all. I don't have these negative feelings. Instead I feel **perplexed and baffled** as to how so many misconceptions spread so quickly and divided the community so harshly.
You say they should have tried to engage in technical discussions before signing the NYA, but they did. Technical discussion on how to scale Bitcoin had been taking place for 2+ years, mostly on bitcoin-dev. Segwit2x itself was initially proposed in an email on bitcoin-dev in March 2017.
When all these efforts lead to nowhere, that's when the NYA happened.
In my opinion the NYA is completely misunderstood. Their intent was never to forcefully "impose" their rules. They were merely trying to get Bitcoin out of the scaling debate deadlock, by **leading &amp; showing unity** among companies forming the backbone of the Bitcoin ecosystem, hoping to quickly get votes of confidence and hoping to build consensus.


You are right, however it doesn't matter. People who read and understand the code have a certain leadership and can influence the community in forming opinions. That's exactly what we are seeing with the no2x vs segwit2x debate: 99% of users here are unable to read code, and yet they can take a position (whichever one) on the debate.


There is no such callback, to my knowledge.
As to replay protection, the segwit2x camp does not want it because it would require millions of SPV wallets to be upgraded.


There is no such thing as "the client". There are multiple segwit2x-compatible implementations: BTC1, Bitcoin Unlimited, etc. In a p2p protocol like Bitcoin **no one has "control" of it**. Anyone can fork any time. It's like saying that the Apache developers have "control" on the HTTP protocol... They don't.


Again, the segwit2x camp **cannot** sack the Core team. Only Core can sack itself. In the hypothetical scenario where segwit2x wins, the Core team **could**, if they wanted, choose to remain relevant by simply merging the small segwit2x patch into Core. (Of course not all 200+ Core devs would agree to that, but perhaps a fraction would consider reluctantly merging the patch and carry on...). Again, Bitcoin is a p2p protocol and anyone can implement a client. I really, really don't understand this perceived idea that segwit2x can "fire" Core. They simply can't.

Easiest way to split your coins without sending **all** of them to an exchange:
1. Before the fork, consolidate all your coins in one address in a local wallet, then send a small amount (0.01 BTC) to Coinbase.
2. Coinbase will split the 0.01 and claim they will do this within 4h of the fork.
3. After the fork, send your 0.01 BTC from Coinbase to the consolidated address of your local wallet, and resend everything to a new address "A".
4. Wait for the transaction to "A" to be confirmed. Repeat the same steps with the 0.01 B2X but resend everything to new address "B".
That's it. Your coins are split with the BTC in A, and the B2X in B.

That's exactly my point: it will take a long time for hosted wallets to upgrade, it will take a long time for local wallets to upgrade, it will take a long time for users to install them, and migrate their funds to segwit addresses, etc.
Because of all this it will be years before we can actually see a doubling of the transactional capacity.
Also, a point everyone forgets: the UTXO set is so large (58M) that if Bitcoin dedicated a third of its transactional capacity (100k txn/day) doing nothing but sending BTC from non-segwit to segwit addresses (at 2 outputs per txn), it would take 10 months to migrate. Only after this migration would all users **actually** be able to use segwit...

As a computer scientist as well (20 years of infosec/software engineering, wrote the fastest Bitcoin GPU miner in late 2010, rolled out many 100× improvements in my career, etc) I feel there are no valid technical arguments against doubling the block size.

I agree with your general sentiment. But I have always pointed out that posts like yours fail to mention **concrete metrics**. Facts and data.
The fact is: running a full node is already inexpensive and would remain inexpensive even with 2-4MB blocks. The amortized cost of running a full node is only **[5 bucks per month]( This includes bandwidth &amp; hardware. So, yes, a "fridge" can already be a full node.
In a sense, Bitcoin is already "getting smaller" over time, because technological progress far outpaces the growth of the blockchain.

An argument I sometimes hear is that “there is no severe congestion, because if there was, segwit adoption would increase more sharply.” This is flawed reasoning because other factors—independent of congestion—slow down segwit adoption: wallet software and services are not upgraded to use segwit by default, users are unaware of how to enable segwit or why they need it, etc. (From

Adam "confirming" the miner means nothing. Remember when Gavin Andresen "confirmed" Craig Wright was Satoshi? People are easily tricked.
In fact this demo reinforces my feeling that Halong Mining may be a scam. If I were a scammer I would try to fool a high profile individual like Adam to build an appearance of trustworthiness:
* step 1: show up in Slush's office with a piece of hardware (that looks **100% identical** to an AntMiner S9) and invite Adam
* step 2: confirm for a few minutes that the piece of hardware can mine (well, duh, it's an S9)
* step 3: pack up and leave, so no one can inspect the miner in detail
Does it prove Halong Mining built the miner? No.
If they were reputable they would **give away** the miner to Adam (who could open it and inspect it)... just like Canaan did when they gave away the first ASIC miner ever (Avalon 1) to Jeff Garzik.

Look at the numbers: at worst, doubling the block size only doubles storage and traffic. That's all. Why would 4Mweight blocks be totally fine, while 8Mweight blocks completely break down scalability? They don't. 8M works pretty much just as well as 4M.
Maybe you misunderstand segwit2x. The point of it is to do a **one-time** doubling. I hope that we can stick with a 8Mweight limit forever, provided that layer-2 solutions work.

Wrong. At 50% we will have capacity increased by roughly 1.5×. To get a doubling of capacity we would need 100% segwit adoption. With the current rate of adoption (0 to 10% in 2.5 months¹), it would take **1 year** to multiply capacity by 1.5× and **2 years** to double it... Far from sufficient to relieve congestion on the network... Layer 2 solutions will take years to be ready and usable at scale.

Do you know how a **peer-to-peer protocol** works? I know git (been in software engineering for 20 years.) My point is that no one really controls a peer-to-peer protocol because every user is free to run whatever implementation they want. Today there are at least 2 implementations compatible with segwit2x (BTC1 and BU). There will be more. In the hypothetical case where segwit2x "won", a fraction of the 200+ Core devs could theoretically fork Core and merge the small segwit2x patch and keep working on that new codebase without ever taking anything else from BTC1. That would be a 3rd implementation. Who do you think "controls" Bitcoin by that point?
No one.

Actually, if we doubled the block size today, we could very well in the future halve it if needed. Rules can change however we want over time. Past blocks can follow different rules.

Fiat currencies like the USD are **not** "backed" by any "real world assets" whatsoever. The very definition of "fiat" is that it's not convertible, not backed by anything.
As it has been demonstrated a countless number of times in history—examples: German Papiermark, Zimbabwean dollar—a fiat currency could still be "backed" by the power of a government and yet be run into the ground and become worthless... because it's not backed by anything.
u/WalksOnLegoredditor is economically correct: the only reason a fiat currency has value is because people think it has value, because they presume there will be **demand** for it (eg. a stable economy of merchants asking to be paid with it, or a stable government asking for taxes to be paid with it.)

I agree, good decision given your situation. However I need to nitpick on one small detail:


This is a dumb advice as it convinces people etching on metal is the "Right Way", so they keep postponing the time-consuming action of actually doing the etching, and during all this time they never implement **simpler solutions such as redundant paper copies, which are superior**. This stupid advice is directly to blame for this guy's near loss: 
«*I was planning to etch the seed on a metal bar and hide it, but before that happened my housecleaning service threw the paper away*»
If he had been told instead to make multiple paper copies, he would have followed the advice right away since it was easy, and would have **never** gotten in the first place into the situation of having a single paper backup that was *meant* to be temporary...
Instead, make 3-4 paper copies of the seed, and simply store it obfuscated and/or hidden in 3-4 different locations: your house, a safe deposit box, your parent's house, your private office, etc. It's very easy to obfuscate the seed so that someone stumbling upon it would not realize what it represents:
* You could convert the words to numbers according to their position in the BIP39 list
* You could highlight seed words as they appear in order across multiple pages of a book
* You could write/print them in a very small font
* You could hide them in an object: a hollow chess piece, lighter, etc
If you are more computer literate you should instead use these tricks to obfuscate and hide not a Bitcoin seed but a PGP passphrase. Then the system becomes a bit more flexible as it solves the problem of how to store securely a bunch of other types of secrets (Bitcoin seed, digital files, master passwords, etc) and the encrypted copies of these secrets can safely remain in digital form, copied in multiple places. The PGP passphrase is the one and only thing that needs to be backed up in non-electronic form.

Again, legally mandated demand (taxes) is not economically different from market demand (merchants). **Demand is demand.**
All that matters is demand and volume. Your example of gold perfectly illustrates my point: demand for gold is far higher and that's precisely why the total supply of above-ground gold (~$7 trillion) is valued higher than the total supply of Bitcoin (~$160 billion).

I keep having to repeat myself, that's why I quote my most relevant sentence and point people to my blog, if they need a more in-depth explanation. But you are right I should explicitly disclose that this is my blog.

@_date: 2017-11-04 02:04:02


That's flawed reasoning. To quote one of my blog posts: "*An argument I sometimes hear is that “there is no severe congestion, because if there was, segwit adoption would increase more sharply.” This is flawed reasoning because other factors—independent of congestion—slow down segwit adoption: wallet software and services are not upgraded to use segwit by default, users are unaware of how to use segwit or why they need it, etc.*"


No it's not. By nature, because Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer protocol, no one can "replace" Core. Anybody is free to run any client they want. Heck if, say, a small subset of the 200 Core devs wanted to release a "Core" version compatible with segwit2x, they could do it. No one could prevent them. People would use their version.


No, the majority of segwit2x supporters (myself included) don't want to replace Core. The fact a few radicals have made that claim doesn't represent our intention.
Besides, no one can "fire" Core. Not even the segwit2x camp could do it in the hypothetical scenario where segwit2x won. Only Core could "fire" themselves by refusing to merge the segwit2x patch.
The segwit2x effort started initially by following the BIP process. This process starts with getting a rough consensus on bitcoin-dev. It's *Core devs* who, by categorically rejecting it, aborted the BIP process.

You are right, there is practically no risk in deploying a (reasonable) increase of the block size limit: 
Some people mention the following risks but IMHO they are exaggerated:
* "centralization"... no, the amortized cost of running a 2MB full node is only $5/month (see above link)
* "miners will drop out at the next halving because tx fees will be insufficient to compensate for the loss revenue"... no, they won't drop out for the same reason they didn't drop out during the 2016 halving
* "block propagation delay will increase"... no, Compact Blocks have pretty much solved the problem: 
* "will de-incentivize work on layer 2"... no, almost everyone in fact agrees that off-chain scaling is a superior solution; a block size increase is just a stop-gap solution to alleviate congestion in the short term

You have got to look at this from the other perspective: individuals don't frequently trade internationally **because** the existing financial system makes it inconvenient and expensive. Our consumerist society has been optimized for local trade as a result of decades of high-friction international payment systems.
But thanks to Bitcoin and other technological improvements (eg. faster/cheaper international shipments) it will become easier and more attractive to buy a random product or service internationally. This shift in our habits/needs will be a long-term process though (years, decades).
Basically you are like a person from 1895 who would ask "why do I need a car? Every place I need to travel to is within walking distance in my village."  But cars changed our habits: they enabled development of larger and larger cities, and now we *need* to travel longer distances. A world without cars seems inconceivable.

It is easy to get distracted by all the good news Bitcoin has been receiving lately: all-time-high price around $6000, a lot of venture capital injected into Bitcoin companies, etc. However this rapid success could disappear just as quickly if Bitcoin fails to increase its capacity soon.
Hitting an ATH does not mean Bitcoin is not broken. Markets can be irrational (eg. bubbles).
Layer 2 solutions aren't ready yet.
Segwit is too little too late.
Blocks have been full for 7 months. The point of segwit2x is only to give Bitcoin a pragmatic fix, a one-time reasonable increase of the block weight in order to relieve congestion right away and give us some breathing room. We can do this while keeping the costs to run a full node low ($5/month) and the network decentralized.

Agreed. But to me, it seems the lack of consensus is mostly a result of technical and political misconceptions (eg. people mistakenly think the segwit2x camp is opposed to off-chain scaling, or people misinterpret the goal of the NYA). That's why I try to clear these misconceptions.
If no one had these misconceptions, there would be—maybe—consensus, hence zero reasons to oppose segwit2x.
(Of course there are some legitimate risks about segwit2x: lack of RP, plan too rushed, etc. However the segwit2x camp simply sees these risks as outweighed by the risk of not increasing capacity soon.)

I agree, the rate increase is more than likely due to Coinbase &amp; Bitfinex. Last time Coinbase had an outage, it was determined they were responsible for 10-20% of all txns, based on the outage's impact on the global txn rate.
Besides, Coinbase not batching their transactions actually **increases** the proportion of segwit transactions (if they batched N segwit txns into 1 segwit in a block, it would have N-1 **fewer** segwit txns.)

Christian Decker block propagation stats are on his site:
Despite the average block growing from 150 kB (Nov 2013) to 1MB (today), block propagation to the 50th percentile of nodes went down from ~5 seconds to 1.5 seconds. This is **mostly thanks to compact blocks which typically shrink a nominal 1MB block to 20 kB transmitted on the wire**. [Graphene]( (developed by Gavin et al) help further reduce this 20 kB down to 5 kB transmitted on the wire.
Greg seems to misunderstand Graphene's IBLT. He claims decode times are high and increase latency, but decoding an IBLT is insanely fast. It's just XORs.
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:57:19


Pealing decoders have nothing to do with Graphene or IBLT or bloom filters.


That's the entire point: to optimize for slow networks. A 30-40kB compact block (~2MB nominal) takes 250-320 ms to send on a 1Mbps link. Graphene shaves off 80% of this time. That's equivalent to the time to do 2-4 network round trips between peers a handful of hops away from each other on the Internet. That's good. That's what we want. It's been repeatedly said that we need to optimize for small machines &amp; slow networks to promote decentralization.


In their simulation, the decode **never** failed by sending 3.1kB (2160-byte bloom filter + 1042-byte IBLT) and it rarely failed by sending 2.6kB (2160-byte bloom filter + 521-byte IBLT).


With a ~2MB nominal block, the IBLT table would have ~100 cells. We are not talking about millions or thousands, but less than one hundred. It's peanuts.


Yes it is an original idea. Your proposal doesn't describe at all the *main* idea of Graphene, which is to combine a bloom filter *with* the IBLT in order to reduce the set of differences. This combination is the key idea that makes it attractive.

Sorry I interpreted "peeling decoders" as meaning something else.


It is not necessarily a 1 Mbps link. We need to optimize for the 99th percentile worst-case (as you have said multiple times). One of these 99th percentile worst cases is a normally high-speed link that is momentarily heavily congested. Block propagation delay still matters in that case.


AFAIK they do not promote it like this. (If they did, it would be nonsense.) But still, Graphene is important for other reasons (facilitating faster block propagation.)


I was assuming a typical bad case. Eg.  has an avg tx size of 390 bytes. Scaled to a 2MB block this would translate to a compact block of 31+ kB.


Full txIDs do not have to be sent as part of the announced block. There are no hidden bw/latency costs that are undisclosed in their test.


The IDs are verifiable, if the tx is in the mempool. The "IDpool" is just a formalized construction to explain to the paper's reader that for this particular step, the receiver doesn't have to know the tx corresponding to the ID.


I guess this will have to be validated by third parties / public implementations.


The number of cells matters a lot: thanks to its small size the reads/writes will hit the L1 cache instead of the RAM. With 2000 txs there will be only at most 2000 cache lines accessed, 2000 sets of XORs, 2000 checksum checks. All this between CPU registers and L1. Therefore decoding the IBLT can be done in the order of a few tens/hundreds of microseconds.


Your proposal, point (2), is so handwavy that I think it is presumptuous for you to call it definitely more bandwidth efficient. You do not define the format of an *uncompressed* sketch, you are not sure if "it wouldn't just be better to fall back to an uncompressed sketch" in one case, you never actually coded it up (whereas Graphene did), etc.
I think the biggest flaw of your proposal is to assume that CreateNewBlock on different Bitcoin nodes will select similar sets of txs. In reality it would often not be the case due to miners implementing different tx selection policies (eg. a pool favoring their own payout transactions over others), nodes having different mempool limits, etc.
Not to diss the whole thing though. I like some of your other points, such as  (CBC front to back and back to front, neat trick.)

Look, I know that economists generally agree that deflation is unwanted. I recognize this. But 100 years ago economists were in widespread agreement on things that sound ludicrous today (eg. that having your currency 100% backed by gold was a great idea—it's not). So if economists have historically often been wrong, what makes you believe that economists of 2017 won't be proven wrong 100 years from now? The fact is, we don't understand economy that well. It's a constantly moving research topic. Knowledge is changing. It is possible (not plausible, but possible) that in the future we will change our stance about inflation/deflation. And maybe no inflation, or a very mild deflation will be seen as favorable.
All I am pointing out is that if you apply critical thinking and examine a particular economic turmoil that is usually attributed to have been caused by deflation, it is actually not very obvious that deflation was a *cause*, as opposed to a mere *symptom*. And this is pointed out by some economists—a minority, I will give that to you. Finally, as I pointed out with **facts** about Japan (low unemployment, high Gini index, etc), it's not even clear what the "problems" are in a country like Japan that is "supposed" to have problems caused by deflation. In our entire exchange you have failed to point a single source, a single fact, a single number that shows "here deflation caused X in Japan".

Ok clarification time. I read the patch, I know how it works. is misinformed, there is no need for "manual coin control or multi-recipient sending". The steps are simple.
On the Core chain do:
* 1. Before the fork: send all your coins to a **new address** you control
* 2. After the fork: send 1 satoshi to the blacklisted ("3Bit") address; wallet automatically send the rest to a **change address**

I can understand this wish, but express yourself correctly. Readers who see your message think you meant there was zero replay protection, not even opt-in.
I don't think the fact BTC1 is developed by just a few devs (jgarzik isn't alone) matters. Firstly, it's literally just an implementation detail. Secondly, anyone is open to contribute to the open source BTC1 codebase. Thirdly, the essence of segwit2x is just a few hundred lines of code, so why would we need 10 devs working on it when 1 is sufficient?
Finally, I have zero misunderstandings, you teach me nothing. Replay protection has been under discussion for a while. It was developed over time. You have no reason to throw a fit that it was initially "forked without replay protection" (duh! Of course, they started from a blank slate)
The replay protection mechanism you suggest **does not work**: the presence of the dust address does not prevent segwit2x tx from being replayed on the core chain.

Following the chain with the most work is a sensible decision that guarantee the **highest security** for their customers. The subject of segwit2x is controversial, but no matter what you think, the minority chain is at risk of double spends, which is the very risk Bitcoin was designed to suppress, so it makes sense to place the label "Bitcoin" on the chain that has the most hash power.

Clearly you do not know me or what I contributed (code &amp; published crypto/PoW research.) But let's not turn this discussion into an ego debate. If I sound abusive, I apologize. Not my intention.


The problem of Fibre is that it is a solution for a very narrow scenario: it assumes the block solved is close to the previously transmitted template. Graphene is a more general solution as any tx in any order can be included in a block and transmitted efficiently.


You realize there are 2 different types of reconstruction failure: either the iblt fails to decode, or the decoding succeeds but the node realizes that it is missing some txs (whose ids are recovered from the decoded iblt.)
In the first case, it is not a big deal: the iblt is just resent with its size doubled (for a block of 2000 txs that means resending only ~1000 bytes.)
In the second case, the node simply requests those tx ids.
Both cases are similar, in terms of cost, to how compact blocks handles failures (and again, iblt decoding time is completely negligible compared to network latency.)


I had read the whole thing. Obviously there is a misunderstanding between you and I. Sorry for the rift it is causing. I do not mean to be disrespectful.
What I am saying: BIP152 is **uncompressed** sketches (didn't know you. You have not published code implementing **BCH and compressed** sketches.
Until both you and the Graphene team publish code that can be tested publicly on the network, there is little point into continuing to argue about which solution is "better."




Do you mean you have implemented **BCH and compressed** sketches and tested block transmission? Where is the code?


That is not what should be measured. You should evaluate whether the *order* of txs matches CNB, and you should also take into account txs *unknown* to you. These 2 aspects will show plenty more differences between what CNB selects and what's included in blocks and reduces the efficacy of your proposed solution.


Incorrect. The very rare miners who use zero-fee payout txs would obviously forward them to peers before a block is solved and/or include them as part of the block announce (again, just like prefilledtxn in cmpctblock) so that zero-fees txs won't lead to iblt decoding failures.




You mentioned pools *usually* usually paid zero fees, when in fact they *almost never* do. Big difference.

I just gave you an example: congested link drops usable bandwidth to 1 Mbps → Graphene shaves of 80% of the 240ms needed to send a 30kB compact block, or 80ms to send a 10kB block. Saving ~100ms or more is worth it.


No, watch  They say "Graphene's block announcements are 1/10th the size of current methods," not "it reduces bandwidth of a node to 1/10th".


Why is it rigging? It is common that a node typically has all txs of the block in his mempool before a block is announced. If a miner knows the block it just solved has some last-second txs that he expects other nodes are missing, it could speculatively send them along (just like prefilledtxn in cmpctblock).


It was not. Compact blocks aren't what you discussed in point 2 (set reconciliation.)


Then we go back to my original point: it is a high level design document that does not dive in the details (the devil is in the details) because you never completely coded your set reconciliation proposal, therefore it is presumptuous and premature for you to call it definitely more bandwidth efficient.  


I guess there is only one way to know: code it up, and demonstrate it to us. You seem to assume everyone runs Bitcoin Core's CNB logic (not unexpected for a Core dev's mindset :-D) In reality miners often develop their own block construction code and tx selection logic, and they do not necessarily select the same txs as CNB would have.


New analysis done across 48 hours:  out of 372971 txs, only 11 (0.003%!) paid zero fees. They are so rare this is not a concern for Graphene's ability to work well. The only pool that does payouts with zero fees is F2Pool (batching 3200 outputs in 1 tx.)

I think we can **all** benefit from segwit2x. The idea is that doubling the block size to 2MB/8Mweight makes the Bitcoin ecosystem healthier and gives us more time before off-chain scaling technologies are ready/implemented: MimbleNimble, batching, LN, etc.

To my understanding, it doesn't bloat the UTXO because Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 now stores UTXO per output (not per tx), so because all outputs go to the same 3Bit replay protection address, it's just one address to keep track of in the UTXO set.

Most economists would say it's better to have moderate but constant economic growth, than erratic growth (boom and bust cycles).
So, no, doing everything to push toward growth, growth, growth at all cost isn't necessarily better if it causes a severe recession every decade or so. And this recession cancels all the super-growth you have achieved the preceding years anyway.
Look at the US, it's a perfect example of what can go wrong: the dot com bust of 2000, and financial crisis of 2008 have severly disrupted the lives of millions and created tons of social problems.

They mistakenly think segwit2x is about "firing Core". It's not: 
They also think doubling the blk size is dangerous because it increases blk propagation delay to the points many nodes can't run. However this reasoning is based on a flawed Bitfury study: 
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:01:29
To me, segwit2x is not about "capturing the flag" or "firing Core" or whatever. For example I would be perfectly happy to see the Core implementation double to 2MB/8Mweight blocks and not even have to run the BTC1 implementation.
My support for doubling the block size comes purely from technical reasons.
What does "Bitmain's influence on the Bitcoin brand" even mean, concretely? It sounds like your objections to segwit2x come from politics, not from technical reasons. In a proof-of-work blockchain miners' incentives are aligned with users' incentives: **if the coin loses value, miners lose mining revenues, and users have a coin that's worth less**. It's that simple.

This is not a point *against* Graphene. It would still be worthwhile to add Graphene to Fibre.


This image was created and published by journalist Jamie Redman:  not by the Graphene researchers.


I agree, and it practice it probably will be implemented without this formal "IDpool" construction.


I disagree. If the receiver has a mempool with 4000 transactions, the success rate will be exactly the same as an IDpool with 4000 transactions.


If you did, what does your code do in this case where you are not sure if "it wouldn't just be better to fall back to an uncompressed sketch"? Why is the format of your uncompressed sketch undocumented? Why is your EBT doc so handwavy and light on details?


No. Again, the main (and only!) insight of Graphene is to combine a bloom filter with an IBLT. Neither compact blocks nor fibre do this.


Still, Graphene is handling this case better than your proposal: there would be much fewer differences because it doesn't rely on consistent CreateNewBlock behavior. Instead it supplies the bloom filter that works equally well regardless of the policy that nodes follow to choose txs to include in a block.


This is false. In the last 100 blocks, out of 147224 txs only 6 pay zero fees:


The bottom line of our discussion is that so far you have (1) neither substantiated your claim that Graphene IBLT decoding is slow (it is not as it fits in L1), (2) nor that it is worse than existing solutions such as compact blocks / fibre (in fact it improves them), nor (3) that they failed to attribute prior work (they are the first to propose combining bloom filter + iblt.)
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:25:31
No, some of us segwit2x supporters are definitely **not** trying to "fire Core"! I swear! We would be more than happy if Bitcoin Core implemented segwit2x and if none of us had to run the BTC1 code base.
I care about doubling the block size for purely technical reasons. Fact: 99% of blocks are currently full at ~4M weight. And yes segwit adoption will help pack more tx per block while staying at ~4M weight (growing from 1MB to ~3.7MB), but that's only possible if segwit adoption was higher and right now the adoption isn't looking good (~7%). **Not having headroom to scale on a short notice is dangerous**, we are basically dependent on having to wait for sw adoption to increase to be able to increase the tx rate. Because blocks are full, fees are high, Bitcoin has lost 70-80% of the market share of tx rate to alts: there are ~1M tx/day amongst top 5-6 cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin accounts for only 250k tx/day. There is anecdotal evidence that users are abandoning Bitcoin for ETH or LTC or DASH for this reason.
IMHO segwit2x opponents don't grasp or don't see the urgency of the situation. They rely on flawed indicators. For example they will say there is no problem because the mempool is small. But **the equilibrium when Bitcoin can't process enough txs is not a growing mempool, it's blocks being full while the mempool stays small**: users submit enough transactions that can confirm right away while filling up the blocks, but they won't submit more txs that will linger in the mempool forever.

It's a **widespread misconception** that segwit2x will "get rid" of core developers. I'm in disbelief that no one seems to understand the dynamics of how things would play out.
**If** segwit2x were to hypothetically gain majority support then what will happen is that all Bitcoin implementations will implement the few changes that make up the segwit2x feature set. That includes Core, bcoin, btcd, etc. Sure, Core may do it begrudgingly, but they would rather do it than run against majority support. Then everyone is back up and running whatever their prefered Bitcoin implementation is. And Core will happily continue development and continue enjoying leadership, as they would probably remain the most popular implementation. Meanwhile BTC1 will probably be obsoleted because its goal (doubling the block size) has been accomplished.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:37:35


Fair enough. I am saddened that the actions/comments of a few tarnish the image of what segwit2x as a whole wants to achieve.


What is not real about  ? You mean "opt out/default" instead of "opt in"?


But the goal with segwit2x has never been "as many tx as possible". It's just a one-time doubling to give us **breathing room** now. It doesn't preclude continuing to work on other off-chain scaling solutions: MimbleNimble, batching, LN, etc.


I think Bitmain isn't stupid: they know that higher Bitcoin adoption means higher mining revenues/fees for them. They don't (or shouldn't) care much if scaling happens on-chain or off-chain. If it happens off-chain, at least the chain becomes the settlement layer and (high) tx fees will presumably continue to have to be paid. The fees will be proportional to the amount of off-chain transactions. So Bitmain's goal is, in the end, higher Bitcoin adoption.
Anyway, I get it. I get your point. You are afraid of Bitmain. You and I simply have a different perception of risks that miners such as Bitmain cause. And I don't think this is something we can resolve/clarify in a few online messages. Time will tell how things turn out. Thanks for participating in an intelligent discussion.

Millions of transactions to that dust address are still consolidated into only 1 UTXO. But I understand now what you complain about. It's not the **UTXO set** but the **surge of transactions** that worries you. These are 2 different things. (Man, why do so many debates I have with no2x supporters end up being caused by improper use of technical language?)
I agree the surge in tx is a downside of this replay protection. But even if 1M wallets opt in, it will lead to a surge of 1M tx which at 3 tx/sec it will only take 3.9 days to confirm them. It's a one-time cost that isn't that bad.

And there is more than Garzik: Gavin Andresen, the previous *lead maintainer*, who also supports segwit2x.

Ok. Just play out events as they will probably unfold. If these miners act on their intent, then the Core chain will be left with only 6% hash rate post-HF. Dramatic slowdown. 1 block per ~3 hours.

Actually, the tx outputs rate (which is independent of batching) is also at a 2-month low:


Easy: block weight/size can be influenced by the number of **tx inputs**. So the tx rate and the tx outputs rate can both go down while blocks are getting bigger. This happens for example when there are more transactions than usual consolidating many inputs into few outputs.

Well my point is segwit wasn't sufficient as a one-time boost. The network is stuck validating transactions at max capacity 95% of the time. Having segwit doesn't mean that if we wanted we could mine a 2MB block tomorrow. We couldn't, because the rate of non-segwit txs are wasting the 4M block weight quota in almost every block (4M weight = ~1.1MB with 8% of segwit txs).
Can you visualize the problem? It means if the **rate of adoption of segwit** is not enough to serve the needs of the **rate of adoption of Bitcoin** then Bitcoin is missing the opportunity to serve additional txs to its users. We will see that as blocks always being stuck at ~4M weight (while the size grows from ~1.1MB to ~2-3MB) despite segwit adoption increasing. In fact, so far that's exactly what have been seeing.

Not by very much: only ~2% of blocks are near empty. But if you think that losing 2% of capacity is such a terrible problem, then increase the block weight limit.

Ok clarification time. I read the patch, I know how it works. is misinformed, there is no need for "manual coin control or multi-recipient sending". The steps are simple.
On the Core chain do:
* 1. Before the fork: send all your coins to a **new address** you control
* 2. After the fork: send 1 satoshi to the blacklisted ("3Bit") address; wallet automatically send the rest to a **change address**
That's it. All your coins are now RP-protected. Segwit2x BTC is in **new address**, and Core BTC is in **change address**

Re: Bitfinex BT2 futures market: it opened literally a few hours ago, so I think it's too early to draw any conclusion on price.


This won't/can't happen because segwit2x doesn't have EDA (emergency difficulty adjustment) like BCH. So difficulty can't be easily be gamed. Miners will always have to wait a full 2016 blocks for diff to readjust. IMHO EDA is one of the 2 crucial mistakes (along with removing segwit) why BCH failed to gain more traction.

No, look at the transaction count chart. Segwit transactions dropped in **absolute numbers**. This is what big blockers have been explaining for a while now: it will take a long time (too long) for segwit adoption to reach significant levels. Meanwhile the network remain congested with over 90% of blocks over 90% full:  (from 
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:33:34
Segwit had been active for 2 months, not 1. 8% adoption in 2 months is not good.
We probably need to get to 50%+ adoption in 6 months to catch up with market demand for tx rate. Anything short of that and the network will remain congested for the foreseeable future.

I think you were not aware, hence your untrue comment ("no replay protection").
Anyway, the plan is to communicate users the need to opt into this replay protection. I disagree that it's a kludge. It's a nice solution that doesn't require updating SPV wallets. It couldn't have been done the other way around, because it would require Bitcoin Core to make code changes and, as you know, they will of course never agree to do them.
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:55:02
This can't work for a reason I've already explained: BCH's RP system would require software upgrade to all SPV wallets, hence increasing the bar for adoption. Segwit2x aims at being a smooth upgrade requiring little work from endusers and wallet developers.
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:43:14
Ironic: you accuse me of using a baseline of 1 example, when yourself use a baseline of 1 example.... Anyway, 1 miner didn't follow up their intent. Big deal. **The others 99% of the miners did follow up on their intent**, thus proving my point.

**Bitmain is not the only ASIC vendor.** There is also BitFury and Canaan. All 3 make top notch 16nm ASICs (0.10-0.15 J/GH... the difference doesn't matter much with current diff &amp; price).

Firstly, I must commend you for your well-explained rational position (compared to other, hum, users...) Thanks! Upvoted.
You are right, miners follow what's more profitable to mine. I believe that because a majority of them support segwit2x, it will give it value, so they will stay on mining segwit2x. This is very different from BCH which **never** had a majority support, and is why its value never surpassed BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:53:06
No it's not about firing Core. If segwit2x gains adoption, Bitcoin Core would/could easily integrate the segwit2x changes (few hundred lines) and many users would be happy to run Core instead of BTC1 since the **two code bases would become functionally equivalent**.

We are already losing users as we speak. ETH, ETC, LTC, DOGE (believe it or not) already process, combined, almost **twice more daily txs than Bitcoin**. Some of these alts' gains are not related to Bitcoin's limited tx rate, but I can assure you that some users were enticed to try these alts because they were tired of Bitcoin's full blks &amp; high fees. I agree we need alts, but losing users to them *because* of Bitcoin's limited tx rate is disappointing.
Of course we need to primarily find ways to grow off-chain, but the point of segwit2x is to give us **a one-time increase &amp; some breathing room** while off-chain scaling solutions are still being developed: NimbleWimble, batching, LN, etc

Do not twist words. Segwit2x has 95% support from the hash rate. That is what setting bit4 mean.

As an ex-software engineer with 20 years of experience, I know a thing or two about open source. There is no disinformation in my posts. You have failed to point out what part exactly is "disinformation"...
Bitcoin's MIT software license allows modification, redistribution, etc. As such, segwit2x is perfectly within their rights to fork it. A court of law would **not** quality this as "stealing".
If not code, what "resource" is segwit2x stealing? The blockchain? It's not stealing, they will simply fork it. Copyrights don't apply to the blockchain.
If not code, not the blockchain, maybe you mean they are stealing the name? "Bitcoin" is not a trademark. Any one can use the name.
If I understand you, it seems what really bothers you is segwit2x trying to take the name "Bitcoin" with them. But why is a name so important to you? Shouldn't you care more about the technology?
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:05:25
Over 90% of blocks are over 90% full (and that's due to low segwit adoption). So, yes, a small block weight limit, with blocks near full, is causing the network to be congested:

Empty blocks are mined by *accident*, not intentionally. (When a nonce is found immediately after a new block is broadcasted, before the current merkle​ tree can be assembled)

No one willing gives up 2-3 BTC of fees per block. That's economic non-sense. For a while people thought empty blocks were required to implement asicboost, but it's incorrect. You can leverage asicboost AND get the fees from full blocks.

I agree with you. What I meant is that these pools that try their luck with empty blocks actually almost certainly try very hard to speed up the time it takes to validate the block (because they would really prefer to chain off it, to reduce the risk of their empty block being discarded in favor of the full block---always better to build on the longest chain.) Unfortunately they still occasionally (hence, by accident) mine empty blocks. But I hear your point, that by trying empty block, they do it intentionally and not by accident. We are arguing semantics here.
Also, what I want to point out is that people *unnecessarily* focus way too much on these empty blocks. They account for ~1% of the blocks. If all pools were cooperative and actually never tried their luck with empty blocks, then the tx capacity of Bitcoin would increase ~1%. Completely negligible in the grand scheme of things.
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:44:25
This study is famously misleading. All it tells us is that node operators tend to provision exactly the hardware resources required by the current block size. No more no less. Why would they overprovision a node by 8x to support an 8MB block size that's (apparently) not going to happen anytime soon?
Today some people run full nodes on Raspberry Pi for Christ's sake... They do this just because they *can*.  Of course a 32MB block size would force them to upgrade to a better computer. No shit!

Let's make this very clear: I am not mad at all (I am GLAD to have learned something about segwit, really!). I am not saying I'm important (I'm not). And the explanation on bitcoincore.org IS garbage (there are 4 paragraphs of non-technical text, and only 1 sentence giving a very minimal high-level explanation "Segwit improves the situation by making signature data, which does not impact the UTXO set size, cost 75% less than data that does impact the UTXO set size"—it's a 15% ratio of actually useful info in the text).
So, no, I won't go away. I will stay on this subreddit and HELP educate people. We are all here to share (correct) information about Bitcoin. It can honestly say it was never my intention to spread FUD. Heck I even edited my top post to prevent more confusion.

It's a common misconception that large well funded miners make more returns (% ROI, not absolute ROI) than small miners. In fact the opposite is true. A guy with a single 1 kW miner in his house won't incur some cost overheads that large miners *have* to have (data center building, labor, etc). The main factor determining your success will be your electricity cost, not your size. What *is* true though is that large professional miners will make the effort to establish their mining operation where electricity is cheap, whereas a small miner has to pay whatever rate his household is charged.

3. "Bitcoin Core developers are lying to the world" -&gt; this happens more often than you think. Check the very page I linked to on bitcoincore.org and read the retraction they had to publish about compact fraud proofs.
