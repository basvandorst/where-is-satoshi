How old are you?

How will you scale to 50 units with that?

You are plugging all 4 S9s to a single power outlet without problems?
 I thought power draw was a problem

Nice, what field do your work in? And what has been your salary progression over the past few years if you don’t mind me asking.

interesting, how much was the electrician cost? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:13:23
How did you secure the electricity source?

gdax seems to be lagging behind on the bitfinex price movement so it's likely just arbitrage bots trying to catch up. Volume is very thin on gdax in comparison

This is a huge fallacy that keeps spreading around. You have no idea about Satoshi's coins, none, nothing whatsoever. For all we know, none of his known addresses have ever moved but for someone who has such a secretive identity you can bet your ass that he has plenty of bitcoin we also do not know about.

reported just as futures in another article, this is pointless -_-

I don't understand what is coinbase/gdax doing wrong? I send and receive using segwit adresses with them.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:06:54
Totally agree. 
For that very reason, I also hold LTC but refuse to hold any BCH. 
However, if BCH had gone the same route as LTC and build its own thing not directly attacking BTC, I would certainly give it a shot.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:24:13
Hmm I;m a bit confused. I use the ledger nano s which supports segwit. I send and receive from it on GDAX. am I missing something?

What app is that on your watch?

Same I gotta say as much as I hate big banks, BoA has given me no trouble with purchases over the last 2 years

You’re delusional if your believe it will get anywhere near 3k. We might retest 6k levels but that’s the best you could hope for.

That's very true, however, I've also noticed that although all these random people brought up the topic, very very few of them were actually informed on how to buy bitcoin. So this wave, really just brought a huge amount of awareness to the scene and not necessarily although of buying. Now that a a new group of people are aware to get into cryptos in general, and of course buying cryptos becoming easier and easier everyday (such as robinhood) the next bull run should technically be even more violent than the previous.

How did you get that 55k in 2022 number??
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:58:09
Because sql doesn’t offer anything special...
@_date: 2018-07-23 05:14:24
Theoretically, that’s true. But often times, they get forced into opening positions they don’t necessarily want to take in order to create liquidity for their customer base without having to disrupt natural market movements.
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:39:42
You do realize bitcoin still inflate at 4&amp; per year right? and that will drop to 2&amp; per year for 4 more years after next halving? etc etc
We are still in the very strong inflation time period for bitcoin... keep that in mind... 
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:18:46
Why does it seem like the Ledger gets a lot more recommendation than the Trezor? What are the benefits? 
@_date: 2018-07-23 04:41:54
That’s true but... if someone wants to go long and there is no party wanting to go short, then the house/market maker (CME) needs to open the short. 
In the end, if the house has more shorts open than longs, they try to push the market down to avoid losing money, etc etc...

Here’s the problem, if the government starts tracking every little movement of bitcoin dust. And they wants their share of the tax pile. 
What is going to stop them from enforcing taxes on bitcoin that scale with USD inflation? Once that happens, doesn’t btc become useless?
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:35:47
The events leading to the 2014 crash are completely different. It just doesn’t apply to this current crash... 
@_date: 2018-04-19 02:59:12
Thanks for that, gosh I hate him even more now...
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:36:14
Currently cryptos are taxed at the same rate as everything else. What I fear most is that crypto tax getting raises over time to 30-40-50-60-70%... The fact that the government can tax anything at any rate is what I fear most about my bitcoin holding.
PoW is no big deal to me, I believe the problem will solve itself as the équipements efficiency increases exponentially. What do you think about that?

How do you know he still hodls btc?
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:59:41
he answered someone else who asked the same question, he said lost 35kg, mostly because of crappy food and small quantities.
