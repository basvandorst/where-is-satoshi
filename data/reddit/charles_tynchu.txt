There's a lot of fish in the sea, so maybe. I think you can come up with something more valuable to a larger audience if you keep working at it though, to be honest. 
If you have access to a 3D printer and the ability to make these, then keep developing ideas until you don't feel the need to ask this question. 
You can do much better.

I'm curious as to whether or not they are, in the near future, preparing to discuss or evaluate possible regulation regarding electronic cash payment for intellectual property/copyrightable material. Also, if they see transactions that are less than a cent to be feasible with the current networks/infrastructure or if they are even interested in enabling those types of payments.

If you never did anything illegal, than of course you are fine. If you may have on the other hand, say with your BTC/whatever-not-fiat, than it depends on the steps you took after the purchase. More than likely though, 
You're probably fine!

Oh sorry guys, that was me. Gotta get some coffee for the next couple years and I don't want the price to ever change for any reason because that's how economics do the economys. /s

Fantastic article! I learned a good bit! Thank you for sharing! So far, I've enjoyed every article on your site (less than 10 so far, but still!) - keep it up!!!

Virwox has never taken more than a few minutes for me. You cant buy BTC directly from the site with Fiat, but you can buy SLL and exchange it for BTC at a rate lot less than Coinbase charges for straight Fiat to BTC.
It's worth a look.

I think the all your questions, if not at least the majority, have answers that can be found through qthe citations referenced by the author of the content available here: 
I'm rather certain you'll find information you need in those included citations.
NOTE: I actually just had been reading this statement and still had it open on my browser, so I figured I'd share since it seems relevant to your topic(s). 
ACTUAL NOTE: I didn't read all your post. Just skimmed so I'm sorry if I'm off base.

Sounded like Ver's thing for a second there. Is that intentional?

Try to find academic and technical documents from legitimate online sources.
Start with a list of the technologies and logical methods that together make up Bitcoin and/or blockchain. Using that list, learn about each item individually and then it'll be easier to understand how they work together as a whole.

Make sure to highlight the "Private Key holder == Account holder" scenario. I've had a few friends here in my current state be brought to both civil and criminal court following various accusations all ultimately pointing to "S/He hacked my account/password &amp; stole ___$!". 
The police never know how to handle this on-premise so it's ended up being an eventual arrest then being settled as false reports in court or having to actually pay (or at least repeal) the amount the accusor claimed stolen because it was so small relative to the claims they looked into enough to find to be false.
Computer science developments aren't inherently criminal so investing in their systems shouldn't be assumed to be as such. Also, the majority of police offers are not trained enough in electronic crime generally that I think it's best (at least in my town) for them to file a report and let investigators handle it from there unless someone got hurt or something... I don't know enough about criminal Justice in the states to know if my suggestion even makes sense, but I do know people can get away with lying to the government for at least a while, if not indefinitely, as long as the guys on the street don't know what's right and wrong in the world that is digital...

If you want any peer review, please don't hesitate to send me a message here on Reddit and I can give you my email.
I'd love to see it in general though and I'm sure others would as well, so I do want to ask if you'd consider sharing the presentation somehow with us all. It'd be good to make sure everyone in our conceptual community is informed as much as possible with how those outside of it are being relayed information about the elements we are gathered because of.
Thanks for asking in the first place, too! I'm excited to know they're having someone come in and teach!

I guess I just don't see how anything could turn into an AI agent without being designed to be one at the start. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Not enough credit given to the cypherpunk movement! Thanks for mentioning that.

It will require more. Are you sure you understand what is meant by AI?
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:45:16
Abra, localbitcoins or virwox. But watch out for those fees.

They just love money that much more and/or don't require the same caliber of information retrieval from their customers in order to profit that much more.
That would be my best guess, but there might also or entirely be respectable reasons.
I am unaware of any technical reasons this would occur (e.g. lag).

What is your evidence behind believing it is "useless" and an "antique"? "Antique" especially deserves some clarification because typically that implies more age.

Do you realize that government officials don't always preform their duties for the benefit of the people who they govern? I'm sorry for sounding rude right then, but I couldn't think of another way to ask.

Thinking "this that bash the current system" all have the same or even similar motive of doing so is a rather large generalization of both those individuals' motives and the integration into a society's transactional system. 
Not every cryptocurrency user or financial system uses or functions in the same way. Not every human uses a bank or even has/earns Fiat on a daily basis. 
For me, digital currencies are not an investment in financial terms, but an investment in my faith of a less centralized new world order. It's more of a political and ethical asset than an economic one in my opinion if regarding present time. 
Observe the behavior of the powers that be including those that you are not there to see. You ma not be certain of foreign actions or even domestic ones, but what you do know for sure is that you shouldn't wholeheartedly trust a human, especially when it comes to your resources of survival in a system made by humans. I mean, like you said, humans are prone to errors.
Also, just a quick PSA: it's probably best if no one knows how much fiat-competitive valuables you have access to, so please, (i) stop buying digital currencies with payment methods linked to your identity, (ii) stop using apps, OSs and trusting ISPs whose code you can't read, understand and accept potential usage of any data retrieved, (iii) unless you have some sort of technical knowledge at the present time, please at least consider why itd be a good idea to use BTC or anything else digital to buy something from somewhere that could benefit or have incentive to take advantage of knowing your payment method and any other information surrounding it's use.
It takes a lot of effort, time and education to be able to actively partake in trading that has the ability to evade the bookkeeping of those with more money and influence than average. 
Be skeptical, not paranoid, but realize that movements are rising of which were initiated with the intent of replacing our current processes and the financial aspects of how we interact are just a segment of what's yet to change - for the better or worse, if we ever know, we won't until the knot can't be undone.
Also, why are you meeting a pizza guy anywhere but your door? Also also, your whole life savings is in one place? Why would you put anything that is that useful and can be distributed in one location, at least without an authorization mechanism that's not simply a password, pin, etc.?
@_date: 2019-06-18 04:42:52
What and/or where is the math in estimating this?
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:38:04
I enjoy the conversation and don't mind a slight debate. I think cryptocurrencies could be separated from blockchain, but depending on it's alternative infrastructure it may or may not be suitable for legitimate financial exchanges. HashCash is the only one that comes to mind, and not the proof-of-work algorithm, I mean HashCash.com. Blockchain I think can be used in many things without needing there to be a currency associated with it, such as logistics. BiTA ( defines a blockchain as a cryptographically generated distributed ledger, regardless whether or not it has a token and they have some pretty large stakeholders in logistics.

Isn't that assuming incentive must be monetary and/or users be human? How would a spreadsheet provide consensus in the examples I gave above?
@_date: 2018-07-31 05:09:47
Yes it can. It can be applied to many systems in a variety of ways, whether the system is technological, cultural, organizational, legal, politically, philosophical, etc.
Conceptually, any thing that is transactional or has a process of action can most likely be adapted or adopted for integration with a blockchain in some regard.
Securing a voting mechanism in an election could potentially be done using blockchain and/or blockchain attributes, but that doesn't necessarily mean that each vote is a monetary value, just a value.
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:48:28
Please define spreadsheet and blockchain for me than because I'm pretty sure their only similarities rely on the fact they're both types of ledgers.
