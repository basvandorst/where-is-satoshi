I think "hodl" is annoying, pretty clear 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:51:00
Agreed, I'm just happy I got in at a point where I feel that it is very unlikely BTC will dip to again (fingers crossed) IMO investing above 10-12k is risky business 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:16:43
Seems like a coin-spiracy 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:15:24
I love it when people say bitcoin is worthless. Because I guarantee if someone offered to give you 1 BTC right this moment you would not be like "no thank you it's worthless" 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:24:32
How about "hold" ?
@_date: 2018-09-02 05:33:48
Wow. Genius.

Referencing hodl meme is like posting a bad luck Brian meme in 2017
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:47:01
Eventually rampant "hodlers" are going to lose their money. Who knows how long it will take, but I think it's important to pick a price point at which you will be happy with your return and get out (if you're using it to make more fiat that is). It takes responsibility, BTC Investment can be the type of thing where you make a ton, get out, then it goes up more and you're like oh man I ONLY made 7000% profit?!?! Bummer.

@_date: 2018-05-16 22:53:08
It’s bitcoin and you’re asking why it’s moving 50 dollars...
@_date: 2018-05-01 23:31:25
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:15:04
Um 
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:34:09
Why would you wait for it to go up to buy?
@_date: 2018-05-16 23:09:11
The average person does not have 50k invested in crypto right now 
@_date: 2019-11-08 23:00:50
I want it to go up as much as the next guy but the 1 year and 5 year charts look like there is likely  further room to go down (but of course no one knows)
@_date: 2019-03-11 22:38:40
Awesome house, can’t wait for the ghost stories 
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:22:12
“Stack sats” is the ultimate cringe

I can’t imagine typing this much... ever
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:48:24
Borrow bitcoin at 6000, immediately sell.  Bitcoin goes to 4000 and pay them back. Pocket 2000. 
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:08:47
Do you think we are still headed down further after the spike?
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:14:12
@_date: 2019-10-02 16:26:34
Sounds like chase did nothing wrong to me
@_date: 2019-04-11 18:04:55
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:40:00
Yes. Do it. 
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:49:14
Good one....?
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:04:27
I mean coinbase is insured, so worst case scenario you will get your money back. I think telling the majority of people who probably have less than $1000 dollars on coinbase (probably a lot less) to immediately worry about getting it off the exchange really isn’t totally necessary... I get it, one whole btc is a lot of money, but acting like having it on coinbase is the worst thing ever is in my opinion, an exaggeration...
Edit: I just read that maybe only your usd wallet is insured? If so, that’s sketchy for sure... either way I think it’s alright to keep some btc on coinbase
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:43:24
I truly think this whole notion is way overblown. Coinbase is a safe place to keep it imo. I’d rather have it on coinbase than in a stick in my closet that I could lose or could get stolen.. idk just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:10:05
Uh, yeah lol
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:55:36
I know, but I’ve used coinbase for years and have never had one issue or ever even had to contact support... just my opinion.. I’ve had a great experience using coinbase so I just like to offer my view on things when people start trashing it.
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:13:54
You’re really overreacting. You’re assuming he was talking about you specifically when really his comment was addressing bitcoins utility on a large monetary scale as opposed to small every day transactions (ex. Pizza or hotdog).... your comments are pretty embarrassing 
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:05:08
Dude that’s like 100 dollars just forget about it 
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:13:54
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:27:28
I understand that people are having issues with coinbase and that it can be very annoying, but I think often times it has more to do with your bank than with coinbase. Once you are verified (in my experience) things run pretty smoothly. About a week ago I withdrew over 10k and it was in my account in 2 days. Maybe I'm just one of the lucky ones
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:34:15
Why are people still posting this 
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:07:02
To be totally honest, no one here will admit it but probability like 75% or more of people on here are just speculators trying to make money. I couldn’t give less of a shit about any of this I’m just making money trading it 
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:24:03
 Would really recommend just using coinbase. All of the bad press about it is from noobs who tried to sign up at the same time as a gazillion other people around 20k and got mad because of delays. I got on coinbase in August of 2016 and have had nothing but good experiences. Also people who are all “they’ll steal your coins! It isn’t secure” are idiots. Most of the people on here are only trading with a couple hundred bucks anyways 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:37:46
It's so funny like rather than spending 600 on some YouTube course why not just spend that 600 on bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:21:03
Didn’t it just go up from like 5800 to 8300 range? Wtf are you talking about 
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:26:34
No. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:03:52
Y’all are cringey as hell
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:57:41
Yeah I know what you mean. I’ve reached my goal of how much BTC I want so I’m thinking about just forgetting about it and checking back in a long while, for my mental health lol
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:05:37
No. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:28:55
This is the type of thing I have no interest seeing on this subreddit 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:29:34
The tried and true method 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:56:30
Hahaha. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:47:08
I want this as much as the next guy but I just don’t see it happening, I feel like people will sell off everything for fiat profits before it can get that high. People are already bummed about not being able to afford a whole coin now, what about when thousands of dollars barely gets you 0.01? I also don’t really know what I’m talking about though. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:49:29
I think in the long run it will. Oh well
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:09:38
Get an ID. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:44:30
Been waiting since around 6600 to buy in thinking it might go a bit lower, wake up to this today, say fuggit and fomo in at 7800 hoping to make some money today if it goes back above 8k. We shall see..... if not oh well
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:29:53
Or it could go up, who knows 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:07:15
I’m either selling when it goes up or just holding it, worst part is I’ve done this before. Some people (me) never learn
