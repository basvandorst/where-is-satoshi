But if it launches it will have a huge impact. Everyone will move to b2x. Before the BCH scandal they all had plans to obtain those free b2x's and trade immediately for BTC. But now with all those transaction fees BTC require and investors moving to BCH... a Segwith2x would be now like a late night show.

Lol dude. Ok, my organ is not big enough, I get it..
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:52:17
Yeah, something written in french

Of course that happened... How many ppl invested in BTC at $7k'sh value to obtain free b2x's? BTC now is $6k. And BCH 200% up in 24 hrs? That's tons of profits involved. Think George Soros in stocks and national banks, lol.

With my 2 weeks of experience I'm being paid MUCH less than you �� 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:14:10
To be honest I regret not speculating that the BCH will rise! But we learn... this is more an investment world than a good-morale community

From a technological point of view, we are all equal

It's like that famous meme with 999 sheeps heading one way and only 1 being skeptical.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:35:45
That's true, a nice consolation .. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:45:36
Maybe because you are a troll also
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:12:29
Yes I am!!! ��
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:09:40
I don't know..

And by the way, r/segwit2x last post is from 6days ago. Do you believe that? I think something is happening behind the curtains
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:35:50
Yea.. BCH is $2,200 from $600 yesterday. Where were those trolls for me to see and invest in BCH?????

If we use an advanced AI system he can uncover the troll hidden in you with 97% accuracy.

Actually historically (without starting with a huge budget) is better to start mining. Investing $2k in mining at the beginnings of either BTC or ETH would mean millionaire now.

My Mistake!
1 INR = 0.015 USD
100 USD = 0.016 BTC

Oh shit. True
