I think short term if you invest etf. Yes. But long term investing that into btc is the best way to go

I agree. I believe bitcoin and other alts will see a dramatic increase over the next year or two because of the possibility of another recession yet you can't knock be market because it has always recovered. Both are great investment opportunities, it would only makes sense to get in on both at once

I was using shape shift through the jaxx wallet. And I found out just now that jaxx having problems with btc to etc translations. I just want to know if it was sent to me or not

@_date: 2017-07-08 23:40:37
I converted from btc to etc. using jaxx shapeshift so should I still look for it on the ether chain?
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:27:34
Damn this sucks
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:26:56
Damn thats why I'm switching to ether at least until segwit is activate 
@_date: 2017-07-08 23:39:13
Is it possible to find where the coin was sent to. I'm hoping obviously that it was converted to my jaxx etc account especially since I did it in app. So if anyone is fucking up its jaxx. I'm just trying to see if my etc address is the final address that all funds were sent too
