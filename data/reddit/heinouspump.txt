Does the Wikimedia Foundation have any sort of investment fund, or is it purely donation driven in a hand-to-mouth sort of way?Maybe Bitcoin could form a small part of a fund if one exists. I'd imagine it's have to be pretty small.It would also be interesting to see whether you can begin to purchase some of the resources you require in Bitcoin further down the line, providing a further way of mitigating fiat conversion costs.

So you're not sexist, you just have a superiority complex in general? Really, most people are idiots?I'm not sure what to say...

She was sexually assaulted. How's that for a reason for feeling uncomfortable?
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:04:49
As a general statement, that's not true. At least not the last part. Source: from Scotland. Few people throw that word around.
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:06:58
Or perhaps it happened because someone was incapable of knowing how to treat other people.No, no, it's her fault. As always.

From 680 to 620 in an hour? Jeez.
@_date: 2014-01-28 07:38:23
You do that, whatever that means. Good comeback.
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:57:58
Yeah, they were 'burners'.

So, it's good that you agree that the guy's behaviour was bang out of order.But why did you assume a girl would making something out of nothing?You seem to be glossing over your own sexism while criticising someone else's.

On the second point, I'd say i think mistreatment doesn't only arise from direct intent to harm.And social awkwardness doesn't really preclude a willingness to learn and to err on the side of caution in social situations.
@_date: 2014-01-24 23:25:31
Seems like you're in the minority here. So speak for yourself.Whiner.
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:49:40
I hope that was at least cathartic, because it wasn't much else.
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:38:45
Ouch... Was that at the start of november too?
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:01:44
That doesn't make it ok. How about a racist joke in a thread about racism?Yep, you really made me look silly now, didn't you! ;)

The 800 coins i think?
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:15:17
I love you.
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:42:18
@_date: 2014-01-24 23:17:56
Please elaborate. I'd like to know how to be as clever as you.

TIL Reddit is America.

You're back! &lt;3

Obvious troll is obvious.
@_date: 2014-01-25 22:15:12
Yeah, it is a bit pedantic. Given the context and a little common sense, i think you can reread that as "females aren't as logical or rational as men".The clue is in the explicit use of the word 'female'. It's one of those differences between natural language and pure logic.
@_date: 2014-01-24 23:23:41
Such as yourself? I'm shocked that you spouted casual sexism in a real subreddit.Oh wait, I'm not.
