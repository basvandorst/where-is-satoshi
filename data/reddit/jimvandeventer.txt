Wait. The promo page says "must be located in the US." Can I order in Canada?
Edit: Placed the order anyway. Fingers are crossed.
Edit  Well, snapCard did give it the good old college try but no luck this time. Apparently credit card confirmation is required on delivery (because heaven forbid someone orders someone else a pizza.)

FYI There is now a tool to export the private key, should the app or the servers the app depends on become inaccessible.

Step 1: Send bitcoins to your blockchain.info wallet.
Done. You now control your own private key.

It isn't off-chain. The private key is just encrypted and obfuscated in a unique way that only their app recognizes.     
The thing I didn't like is that the app will only launch if it can contact Verso's server, Blockchain.info's server and Google. As a result, I found it rather unreliable as Blockchain especially has a lot of downtime.     
There is a private key retrieval tool on GitHub so you can always get at your coins, even if their app has you locked out.

I like your idea and I'm letting you know so you should post the rest of the paper wallets.

Also, make sure App Nap is disabled. I'm not sure if this is the default behaviour in the latest release.

Actually, I can't think of a single online shop app that uses IAPs for product purchases.

Which one is telling the truth?

Or, in the meantime, buy your Steam games with bitcoins from the Humble Store. Something, something, vote with your wallet.

Well, naked on a giant clam shell but otherwise pretty close.
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:25:49
The Oglala Lakota Nation already has, apparently.

Oh, I've had two already and I didn't even know that was a thing. Thank you.

Alright, I'm in. What's a cakeday?
@_date: 2014-04-28 11:16:29
I am going to be out of the country for a while and I'm not counting on having a reliable Internet connection. What options exist for generating and signing transactions completely offline?
@_date: 2014-04-26 10:02:15
Would it be possible to sign transactions while offline? That would be useful when I'm out of the country.
