Bitcoin has had good projects like Bitmit for an Ebay alternative and then Bitcoinstarter for a Kickstarter alternative.
The problem is there just isn't that big a market for Bitcoin versions of these popular sites. There's been so many projects that just haven't taken off due to lack of interest, not for lack of trying though.

Lol. You couldn't be more wrong. If anyone got owned, it was the SEC. That settlement was insanely one sided. I have no idea how he pulled it off, but a 50k fine was a slap on the wrist.
@_date: 2015-06-05 06:48:04
Yeah, this is why I don't really understand why everyone is so 100% attached to Bitcoin and only Bitcoin forever. As long as you're here already you're not going to miss out on the next stage of the technology. That is if you can keep even just a little bit of an open mind and watch what's happening. Being able to effortlessly transform your BTC in to something else in seconds is a big advantage, and you don't have to worry much about being left behind unless you're really blind and/or stubborn.

Okay, that's all well and good. But how is it that you and other people who supposedly have non-violent voluntary interaction as a core belief support Ross? He wrote about non-violence under the DPR alias while at the same time he's paying six figure amounts to have people killed? 
The only thing that I've gathered from all this is that there's a lot of people in the Bitcoin community who are hypocrites. Off the top of my head you, Cody, and Julia are the ones that stick out the most. Vocal proponents of a philosophy that can be ignored at will if you think it will help promote your agenda.

So this is kind of interesting to see play out. Suppose we all accept XT as our new go to client and enough miners, nodes, and most importantly exchanges are on board as well. What happens to the Core Devs that have commit access now? They keep working on BitcoinCore? 
If the hard fork is successful, does that make whoever maintains and has commit access on XT the new "Core Devs"(or XT devs, but the defacto main development team for Bitcoin)? Does this mean that Wlad, sipa, gmaxwell, and Jeff Garzik are no longer 'official' devs for Bitcoin? 
Will it be up to you to decide who you want to share commit access to XT with? I assume Gavin would be one of them.
It's a new type of situation potentially and I just want to understand the implications. No ulterior motive or implied negativity from me.

This is a red herring. Criticize if you will, but this statement is misleading. He's publicly stated that he doesn't even own any VIA. Doing some contract work and getting a title doesn't preclude him from working on Bitcoin.

Now, my goals have shifted. I want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and agression amongst mankind. Just as slavery has been abolished most everywhere, I believe violence, coercion and all forms of force by one person over another can come to an end. The most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments, so this is my current point of effort. The best way to change a government is to change the minds of the governed, however. To that end, I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.

The murder for hire charges are in Maryland but the journal evidence with him ordering the murders was still presented. And it's related to the criminal enterprise charge and the judge said that him doing that is part of the reason she's giving him life.
That quote just makes it worse. What a piece of shit.

But when one takes the further step of sending the supposed hitman hundreds of thousands of dollars, I think it's safe to say he meant it.

Nothing to do with your specific comment here, but I've noticed a lot of people love to use this word in serious manner to discredit real projects with lots of actual code. While they might be technically right, the word seems much less meaningful in a world where github is two clicks away. People will call a project that's almost complete on github vaporware, while also using it to describe some random idea that someone just had and is thinking about developing. It just not a good descriptive word, and it's annoying to see it constantly used here.
Again, nothing to do with your sarcastic post here. Just something I wanted to say and your post reminded me to do so.

@_date: 2015-05-28 11:22:34
People have, including Peter Todd speaking out on such dangers.
Personally, I don't think that there's much of a chance that's going to happen. That would be a lot of phones out there that have to be mining at once. Even if everyone's phone had a chip, who's really going to want to drain their battery all day? Maybe they mine at night or something. But even then, we've already seen the math that shows just how bad of a deal it is for them to mine like that. Even with some generous assumptions. 
Basically the conclusion I'm gathering from most people here so far is that they pretty much have to have some sort of breakthrough chip technology that works much better than this generation of ASICs do. Possible I guess, but seems unlikely.

Well, when you phrase it like this, it's not wrong. But no one sane is claiming that Bitcoin itself is going to solve all these problems or that it can scale(on its own, in a decentralised way).
All these other distributed ledger companies and such are something completely different though. Whether they will solve whatever it is they intend to solve is something completely unrelated to Bitcoin. But since they all seem to be about permissioned ledgers, saying that they won't scale because Bitcoin can't scale is a bit silly.

While I'm sure there are some people outside China mining for the Chinese pools, I've seen a screenshot of one of the pools geographical breakdown of where their hash was coming from and it was almost all domestic(unsurprisingly). Although the good thing was that it was impressively distributed within China, rather than just 2 or 3 big farms like I might have suspected.

His general approach is frankly ridiculous and dangerous for a project like Bitcoin. The fact that anyone still listens to him after he fully endorsed his plan(and 'tested it') to go straight to 20MB blocks that rise to 8GB should really be more than enough for people to say 'ok, thanks, you're welcome to contribute code and work on the project but please stay away from these mission critical design topics'.

Maybe because people in this community have been saying for what seems like years now that Bitcoin ATM prices will go down drastically from competition. And it doesn't seem to be happening. 
10%-20% premium is pretty bad. I don't have an issue with businesses trying to maximize their profit. But I do have an issue with outsiders wanting to buy bitcoin having what would appear to be gouging as their first experience, with a currency that is supposed to be a cheap way to transfer value. This turns off a lot of people.

Actually it's expected to be the opposite. More mining will be done in China because of their firewall slows the propagation of those bigger blocks to the outside world. Effectively making it more likely for Chinese miners to build off of each others' blocks.

Well, there's only so much BTC one can borrow for a short. I'm not saying that there's no short selling attacks, rather I think there likely are many potential things a bad actor could do if the liquidity gets to a point where massive short positions can be taken. But I don't think this particular attack is a concern under the current status quo.
Looking back on the history of Bitcoin though, if Bitcoinica hadn't imploded, and short selling with liquidity became available and common earlier on, there's probably a good argument to be made that Bitcoin would have had suffered some major attacks back when it was much more vulnrable.

Yes, there are definitely some big issues. I wouldn't say that anything is being swept under the rug though. I've seen lots of Core developers openly complaining about so called SPV mining and such.
@_date: 2016-03-04 07:53:21


This is huge. Like virtually all of our problems right now boil down to a group of people simply not trusting the Core devs any longer. Which is why they want agreements written in blood with firm dates and such. They think that there's some big conspiracy and that everyone has ulterior motives. It has really set everything back to a point that is going to be very hard to recover from.
@_date: 2016-03-03 12:06:30
There's a huge difference between wanting Core to commit to a block size increase sometime in the future and going full nuclear and hard forking to Classic. I really think Classic supporters have vastly overestimated the amount of people who would really be on board with something like that. Sure, there are some major players behind it like Coinbase and Ver, but as far as an actual consensus goes I don't think it was ever close.
The idea that lots of people want a block size increase at some point doesn't automatically mean anyone would be willing to go with Classic. JToomim's miner survey seemed to be presented as something that implied anyone who was fine with more than 1MB blocks would also be on board for Classic, but I doubt that was the actual reality at the time. But it seems lots of Classic supporters really believed that there was some massive amount of support behind it. I think it was mostly an illusion.
Garzik going on the Chinese lobbying trip gave it a good shot though. It's not like Classic wasn't trying to steamroll itself into an actual consensus. As far as political strategy goes I can't say they did a bad job overall. But there were some big mistakes that hurt the effort.
@_date: 2016-03-14 19:05:21
Sure, once it's integrated and such it's an entirely different set of calculations.
I don't think Microsoft is stopping offering Bitcoin as a payment method. People are overreacting considering they still seem to accept it for most of their products.
@_date: 2016-03-02 08:22:37
If that's how you want to define censorship resistance, then Bitcoin isn't censorship resistant at all. As miners are free to act as they wish and refuse to include a single transaction if they choose to do so.
@_date: 2016-03-01 11:36:05
Would you be surprised if it was true? I was.
Notice no one has ever been able to find any mention of a public announcement. Other than Classic coming out around mid January with all those miners apparently 'supporting' it.
The meeting(s) went on back in January when Classic was announced. And only happened to be brought up here well after the fact when someone here was reading Chinese forums and saw mentions of a certain 'Jeff' and happened to translate that for us here: 
There was already a rumor that Jeff had jumped on a plane to China when Classic was revealed. His silence around the time that he was revealed as supporting Classic was puzzling. But it makes sense now since he was busy trying to make deals.
Here's a link to an article reporting on one of the meetings after it happened if you're skeptical that they happened. Notice that the article was posted Jan 28th: 
@_date: 2016-03-03 12:20:26
Well that's actually pretty common at places where the owner accepts Bitcoin but the staff aren't properly trained to do so because it's not something that comes up very often. That came up a lot after the whole 2014 push to get people accepting BTC everywhere.
@_date: 2016-03-03 18:53:14
I've heard of people getting photos and such back after formating their hard drives. It probably depends on a lot of different things, but it might be worth looking into the software option. Although that will probably require you to be operating on a separate hard drive than the one that was wiped. I don't have any experience with that stuff so I don't really know, but maybe someone on here knows more and can give you some more information.
I do know that normally when you quick format a drive you're not actually changing any bits and erasing the bulk of the data. Just allocating the space as empty(or something like that anyway). So there might be some hope.
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:59:42
Does it not surprise you that Jeff makes statements speaking out about secret backroom deals publically and then goes ahead and does exactly what he spoke out against?

I would assume so, yeah. But from what I understand OB was designed in such a way using distributed hash tables that make using Tor not possible. I'm not sure if it was specifically designed to not work over Tor, or if it's just a coincidence.
At least that's what I've gathered from some of the other threads on here. If anyone knows more feel free to correct me or elaborate.

@_date: 2016-02-20 17:12:17
Yes, that's true.
@_date: 2016-02-20 14:22:28

@_date: 2016-02-20 18:44:15
Yeah tons of development goes on. Something like a 100 people contribute to Bitcoin Core which is considered the reference client, and it's all open source. Lots of improvements have been made over the years. A handful of people even work on it full time and collect a competitive salary.
They can try to change what Bitcoin is. But no one is forced to run the software they release. Generally there's a lot of debate and such about which directions should be pursued and avoided.
@_date: 2016-02-22 14:41:01
Yeah, the sad part is that instead of writing BIPs and arguing on technical merit has he has done in the past, he's just decided to try the political route and unpublicised backroom deals.

You vote with your wallet by buying or selling bitcoin. At the end of the day that's what it all comes down to.
Not that I'm particularly thrilled about Chinese mining centralization, but still, they answer to the economy too.
@_date: 2016-02-23 15:24:24
That's the thing about Bitcoin though. There are people who control a lot of BTC that singlehandedly have vastly more economic power than most. That's why economic consensus is so important. None of us want our wealth destroyed. Assuming you have economic consensus like Classic has been doing is really dangerous and one of the main reasons why so many people are against it.
In fact, I think on each side, both Classic and against Classic, there is at least one person on each who controls a six figure amount of BTC. If only those two people decided to dump on the other chain that they don't support both of them will end up in a bloodbath.
@_date: 2016-02-23 15:17:47
Yes, it's likely everyone gets badly hurt. Which is why people can't really just take the 'let's sit back and watch Classic do their thing' stance. Classic's actions will cause everyone to lose money regardless of how it works out. It's simply extremely contentious.
The fact that in the last month and a half Classic supporters have tried to present it as something with significant economic consensus is extremely disingenuous. They also claimed that they had widespread miner consensus from day one, which has turned out to be incredibly misleading if not an outright lie. And of course even Classic supporters acknowledge that Classic goes against the technical consensus.
It's scary as hell to think that there are seriously a handful of major players in Bitcoin like Coinbase and Roger Ver who seem to be fully willing to support something like this.
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:03:51
Actually, yeah. That does make sense. I would much rather them deploy their own chain and let the market truly decide rather than potentially have everyone's wealth destroyed by a contentious hard fork.
I'm sure it would gain enough traction to give it a fair shot at competing in the overall market. I'm very much anti-Classic, but I would respect them more if they stopped causing discord in Bitcoin and instead tried to create their own version with whatever variables they think are superior.
@_date: 2016-02-23 12:48:22
Yes, I'm sure many Classic supporters wouldn't hesitate to sell off all of their BTC on the non-Classic chain as well. The whole situation is damaging for everyone.
Some people who support Classic might leave Bitcoin entirely if the hard fork isn't adopted regardless. But the amount of people who leave might also depend on just how successful the current scaling efforts are too. So if there's some real progress there then that might be all some people care about, and enough for them to continue on.

@_date: 2016-02-23 11:35:30
No, I think Brian is wrong because I read his opinions on his blog, the slidedeck, and his twitter. I think his perception of what the results would be from a Classic hard fork is dangerously mistaken. And that he seems to be confusing mining incentives with economic majority. I might have misinterpreted his views, but I know he thinks the economic incentives are aligned, and I disagree with that general sentiment even if I'm wrong on the specifics of why he thinks that.
He's certainly not the only one though who thinks that way about the post hard fork economic results. Everyone who supports Classic seems to think that a 75% hard fork will compel people to change their opinions and accept that new blockchain as the new reality. Where as I don't really know anyone who supports Core(and of course they are many) who would bother participating economically on that post hard fork Classic chain.
If there are people who support Core but would also be willing to continue to hold and transact on a Classic chain feel free to post and register your opinion. Personally I'd support a Core chain with a change of PoW if necessary. I wouldn't hold or use BTC on the Classic chain.
@_date: 2016-02-23 06:59:12
Why have they had them listed on there since day one? I actually copy pasted the website the first time I saw it back when it had the Toomims on there because I was shocked and thought it might be bullshit. Turns out I was probably right for the most part.

If Classic ever pulled off a successful hard fork you would see so many days destroyed that it would blow your mind. Lots of early adopters who have been holding would be bailing out as fast as they could.
@_date: 2016-02-20 19:10:36
Even after the halving that is a ton of demand to sustain with all the money supply inflation. It's possible, but something major would have to happen to produce that kind of consistent demand.

That would be very inconvenient if you were traveling or something and using the money in Coinbase as a hot wallet. Since you might not necessarily have all the required documentation with you.

@_date: 2016-02-23 10:36:36


Where are you getting this? Adam is in charge of two things, his own individual views and opinions and the separate ones he can hold as a Blockstream founder.
@_date: 2016-02-20 09:20:08
Probably because they value being an American and participating in the American financial system(not /s, being rich in America can be good), real estate market, being able to continue their life with their friends and family in their home country ect, over whatever extra money they might theoretically make by cutting out their record label. Plus it's not like they can't be sued in many other countries. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 18:06:35
So if the other chain changes PoW and miners get a good streak of luck going resulting in a longer chain that makes it Bitcoin and the Classic chain isn't?


Who? What's the argument for not selling on Classic and continuing on the Core chain with or without a PoW change?
It's not about ego. Accepting an aggressive, adversarial hard fork that many think holds no merit and is inferior like Classic would essentially prove that the fundamental structure of Bitcoin is flawed. If something like Classic is successful Bitcoin simply isn't very interesting for some people any longer. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 19:00:19
Why centralized?
@_date: 2016-02-23 10:19:18


Why would they have to do this? Shouldn't only deposits and withdrawals have to be on chain for obvious reasons?
@_date: 2016-02-23 10:26:49
If anything I just question his judgement or perception of the community. I don't understand how he fails to see just how many people are absolutely, totally against Classic and not willing to participate economically on the hypothetical Classic blockchain. And not only would many people simply abandon their economic activity on the Classic blockchain, but some percentage of those people aren't just going to call it a day and give up on Bitcoin. I expect lots of people people who fully reject Classic would be willing to attempt to continue on the non-Classic blockchain with a change of PoW if necessary.
From what I understand Armstrong has maintained that if miners enable a Classic hard fork, that the economic incentive for people to use that chain outweighs anything else. And that's completely wrong. If someone views that the Classic chain is inferior the only incentive they have is to get rid of the BTC they have on that chain at as high a price as they can find as quickly as they possibly can. Miners don't have as much power as many people like to think they do. People who use and hold BTC, the economic majority do. Why he fails to acknowledge that lots of big players will never be on board with Classic is puzzling.
@_date: 2016-02-23 06:57:10
It's not dangerous to suggest something that already is the case. But trying to get miners to push through a contentious hard fork where the result may be that the users and economy decides that due to the fact that this happened, Bitcoin is worth a fraction of what it was before the event is in fact dangerous.
@_date: 2016-02-23 10:32:36


Because maybe Armstong is missing something here and perhaps he's open minded enough to change his mind?
@_date: 2016-02-20 19:59:37
Some people are concerned about the fact that the transaction volume has continued to increase towards the limit per block mined by the miners. So people want to raise the size limit per block from 1MB to 2MB so that Bitcoin can theoretically handle more transactions in a shorter period of time.
The main issue is more about when this should happen rather than whether or not it should happen at all. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 09:54:00
Yeah, this person provides some pretty entertaining commentary doesn't he? Full time COO and part time Bitcoin comedian I guess. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:13:29
It might make it more centralized because the Chinese miners are behind the 'Great Firewall' which is a propagation issue for them. Where the centralization concern comes in is that while they have a handicap in terms of the speed that announced blocks can be propagated globally, between the miners inside of China, there's no firewall as far as I know. So in effect that might make the Chinese miners more likely to build off of the blocks mined by their peers within China. That could result in less stale blocks for them and more stale blocks for the rest of the world. Which is an advantage and may make an already bad centralization issue in China even worse. 
It has also been mentioned that the mining situation in China is so advantageous due to subsidized power and access to hardware that even foreigners are setting up mines in China. If it's more profitable and there's incentive to mine in China, I guess we can't be too surprised.
And yeah it is very centralized now, I agree. Authoritarian government that can play the communism card any time it wishes? Could be pretty bad news should the government in China ever really start to care about Bitcoin for one reason or another.
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:09:56

If you mean Bittorrent by file sharing then, yeah. Because they were designed to be censorship resistant, whereas OB was not. I think you've been misled.

Not sure if they've committed to an exact timeline yet but it will be something done over a period of months.

@_date: 2016-02-20 18:25:24
When you put it like that it doesn't sound too bad. But if we're talking billions of dollars knocked off the market cap it reveals that miners can't be relied on to act in what is meant to be in their own rational self interest.

And did you see Adam sign or say anything on behalf of Core?
@_date: 2016-02-23 07:37:51
On behalf of Classic right around the middle of January when it was announced.
Here's one thread that came out about it once the meeting became well known around the end of Jan/early Feb: 
@_date: 2016-02-20 20:51:37
This is pretty much exactly what people have been trying to tell Classic supporters: That Core is committed to scaling Bitcoin, and that they're not against a hard fork.
I don't understand why so many people refused to believe that Core was willing to include a hard fork as part of their overall scaling strategy. Well, here's the proof that I guess some people needed.
Now hopefully we can move on from this drama and stop making this all about politics.
Sanity prevails I guess.
@_date: 2016-02-22 19:15:12
Did you miss the thread before where someone came across the picture of Jeff meeting with the miners on a Chinese forum and came and translated it for us?
I mean they were publicised well after the fact once the thread was posted and such. So perhaps unannounced is a better choice of word.
@_date: 2016-02-23 12:34:58
You're right, I should have left that word out as it's not accurate. I'll edit it.

Do you think the same logic applies for Bitcoin nodes?
Do you believe there's a tipping point where the distribution can be so wide that it can't be shut down? What if one billion people had Bitcoin and anyone could stake on virtually any platform with little overhead(mobile for example)?
@_date: 2016-02-20 07:02:21
It would be better then if Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment wasn't every 2016 blocks then since a big shutdown could render the chain extremely slow and effectively unusable for months.
@_date: 2016-02-20 09:02:27
That's quite the reply...
Are you familiar with Open Bazaar? 
You host your own store on your own node. If your server gets taken down for whatever reason then it's gone. It's not any more censorship resistant than running a website.

I am overseas, but I don't see why that makes a difference. Exposure to what?
@_date: 2016-02-20 19:19:03
Other people have to go along with the changes on a large scale too. They could do that, but effectively what would happen is they would be on their own network with their own 'bitcoin' that no one would recognize or accept for payment. 
It's a bit more complicated than that in reality. But the bottom line is that any sort of change to the protocol has to be agreed on by virtually everyone, and it's very difficult to get people to agree on something unless it's overwhelmingly considered beneficial.
This thread here is such a hot topic because the change that has apparently been agreed on is one of those really big changes to the protocol. And it's pretty much going to be the first intentional change of the protocol ever in this manner, what's referred to as a 'hard fork'. It's also something that has literally been debated about for years.
@_date: 2016-02-23 12:32:23
But it costs them nothing or close to nothing to move numbers around in their local database to keep accounts and balances, right?
@_date: 2016-02-20 16:06:34
It's a protocol and functions on its own network, but every thread on here about it multiple people keep pointing out that it's designed in such a way that you provide your own hosting for your own storefront. Meaning it's decentralized in the same way that the web is. Not in the same way that Bitcoin itself is where every node each has the blockchain and kicking a thousand nodes off the Bitcoin network won't even cause a problem for 99.99% of users.
So if you have trouble with your computer that's hosting your storefront the network may run fine but you can't sell your goods independently of that. Which is exactly how websites work as well. You might have multiple servers for redundancy, but again, like a website.
If you try to sell illegal goods you have to deal with exactly the same problems that you would if you attempted to do the same on a website. Sure it's possible, but there's a reason that all the illicit activity goes on in the darknet on Tor. And there's nothing darknet about OB.

Yes, deposits and withdrawals will cost them money in fees, but not affect their internal off chain transactions. Plus if they feel that the fees are affecting their bottom line they can always just make the user pay the for the fee when they withdrawal. Off the top of my head I can't think of a place that pays the fee for you rather than just subtracting it from the amount you're withdrawing.

@_date: 2016-02-20 18:52:58
No, just know that there are many people who have been in the scene a long time and think a Classic hard fork is a horrible idea.
Roger Ver could do the same thing on the non-Classic chain and dump massive amounts of BTC too. So it's not just a one way dump fest, shit will be flying in all directions and everyone who isn't quick will lose their shirt.
Contentious hard forks won't be pretty.

It's inevitable. But the question is when that will happen. It could be a while. 
Also, that superior technology could very well just incubated as a sidechain for a while until the situation is advantageous for it to fork away from Bitcoin(if it ever gets to the point where enough people feel that being pegged to BTC is 'holding it back' for whatever reason).

Not sure what part of my statement leads you to believe that I would disagree with that. The flexibility and utility that I mentioned makes it interesting because it allows that ecosystem to be built around it.
Also, something like 5% of the gold market would mean prices vastly higher than what they're at now. So if there's a possibility that Bitcoin can legitimately compete for part those trillions in market share then that's only a good thing that would lead to high prices and a secure network. In fact I just made a post yesterday addressing a similar issue regarding price and security:

Bitcoin is just going to rely on fees more and more as the block reward drops. So don't expect cheaper fees any time soon.
@_date: 2015-09-27 13:05:00


I agree, and it's completely fundamental. Bitcoin relies on price increases to maintain network security through the emission schedule. There has to be a certain level of security for Bitcoin to be viable as something that can compete in the global market. I don't know exactly how much security is necessary, but security follows the price, thus price is important if Bitcoin is to be something other than a toy.

Paypal was once the largest payment provider for all online gambling by far. But they pulled out somewhat suddenly in the early-mid 2000s I think.

I think it's going to take something really obvious and special to get Bitcoin back in to another bubble. Considering the constant excellent news and increasing adoption over the last year and a half and the resulting decline in price it's pretty clear that it's going to take some major geopolitical event to get the market going again. So in general with decent margin I think shorting BTC is a very safe bet as long as you're actively paying attention and reading this sub and such. Very easy to close the position if things start to look up.
Bitcoin with its fairly high inflation rate and constant sell pressure actually makes it quite attractive as an instrument to short. Especially these days since it doesn't seem to have nearly the same upwards volatility as it had in earlier times. I never actually put my money where my mouth is and actually shorted it for any considerable amount of time though. But congrats to all the people who have cleaned up over the past year and a half. Lots of money has been made shorting I'm guessing.

The way they've presented that opinion is weird to me. I just would have expected less apparent emotional attachment, less vague implication and more specifics about how and why, less catchphrases like "Bitcoin is a protocol."(yes, and? especially when asked a question about Bitcoin's viability in some area).
Absolutely not weird for them to see the novelty of Bitcoin at all, it would be more weird if they didn't at all. And of course I know who they are, which is why I'm a surprised that they display much of the same characteristics(publicly at least) as many people who seemingly have bought into the idea of Bitcoin on an emotional level. I also realize that talks, twitter, and blog posts almost certainly don't represent the full extent of their feelings and opinions on the issues, and I'm not claiming that they are ignorant of anything(which is why the way they've chosen to talk about Bitcoin is interesting since it might be deliberate). 
It might simply come down to the fact that they have a significant investment that they would like to promote and they feel that communicating this way is the best way to promote that investment. And they're probably right if that's the case. Short, vague cheer-leading comments about Bitcoin from probably the most famous VCs there are have probably sold a lot of BTC.

To be honest I'd say that as a company they have a much higher percent chance of succeeding and becoming profitable at some point with this move. Just seems like the smarter move business wise.
edit: 
Just want to add that it's not like their excluding BTC payments of course. So if anything, there's more potential to introduce outsiders to Bitcoin through something like Changetip. They load their account with USD or receive tips, and then this presents them with what for most people would probably be their first opportunity to instantly convert that money to BTC(I might be assuming too much here with the instant conversion thing I just realized, since they are using Paypal and that's dangerous of course). The upside potential here for Bitcoin is probably higher than it was when it was exclusively BTC, as new users are more important than just getting existing Bitcoiners using Changetip I think. 
There will still have to be incentive for the USD users to convert to BTC, and that's what I think the community should be continuing to focus on. But more gateways that offer fast and easy ways to convert fiat to BTC can only be a good thing really.

I think you are right and make a lot of good points about Bitcoin losing its first mover advantage and not being the most advanced blockchain technology available(although this was always inevitable of course, and there's no way to stop that realistically.). 
But I don't think we should get too caught up or concerned about the whole Bitcoin blockchain as a database thing that's gaining ground. It provides little to no value for Bitcoin the currency or the Bitcoin economy. If fees are cheap enough to allow it then it bloats the blockchain and under any reasonable math provides marginal economic benefits through fees. If fees rise then it just makes it uneconomical. 
Either way the future of Bitcoin as a database is bleak. It either becomes a tragedy of the commons scenario where people exploit the inefficiency until it becomes enough of a problem that something has to be done about it, or it's just too expensive to make sense on any decent scale. I don't think there's an equilibrium there because first and foremost I believe non-database actual p2p Bitcoin transactions will be prioritized, even if this means fees being high enough to push out all the attempted Bitcoin as a database users. The cost of blockchain bloat is just too high and I expect the market to adjust to put a stop to database type uses fairly quickly. And if it doesn't and just becomes a free-for-all where miners go for short term gains over the long term health of Bitcoin then the results probably won't be very good.
@_date: 2015-09-21 21:09:11
I'm not missing the point. I'm asking what specific added value it's going to provide beyond being a Rasp Pi and a mini ASIC. So far all I've gathered is that they expect people to earn money buying and selling things with Bitcoin. That is incredibly vague and only makes me think of Open Bazaar. If Open Bazaar turns out to be as advertised, what advantages are people going to get by choosing this thing as an alternative to a free and open source decentralised system like Open Bazaar?
@_date: 2015-09-18 15:09:55
I don't know either, and there's a chance that it won't work out once the block subsidy gets too low. I mean price wise anyway. It will still continue to function in some form probably indefinitely.
Or maybe it will somehow work itself out. Anything's possible at this point. Doing the math though shows that keeping similar levels of blockchain security up will require a hell of a lot of fees though.
@_date: 2015-09-13 15:02:47
If anything, between the extremely high fees commonly found on them, to the numerous maintenance issues that often leave them sitting there collecting dust, I'd say if anything they've probably had a net negative effect on Bitcoin adoption or acceptance in terms of public perception.
I'm sure I'm not the only one who's had people complain about hearing all these great things about Bitcoin, but then having their first experience trying to buy some topped off with a 10% fee. Nothing wrong with individuals trying to make some money off their Bitcoin ATM. But their personal gain isn't necessarily a gain for Bitcoin as a whole when you consider that Bitcoin is often marketed as something with low fees(or too often erroneously as 'no fees'). No one is claiming that Bitcoin ATMs have low fees, but expectations can be set and it's easy to get a sour taste in your mouth if you feel like you're being gouged.
Not that I think anyone should be stopped from placing ATMs and charging whatever they wish, but for a good couple of years now people in the community have insisted that competition would bring us razor thin margins and good, cheap, convenient ways to buy BTC from ATMs. The reality has been quite different, and it doesn't look like it's going to change anytime soon, if ever. 
I think our only hope for a solid Bitcoin ATM expereince is existing banks implementing BTC purchases in to their exsiting ATM networks. Single use BTC exclusive ATMs probably just don't make enough money to really create a competitive industry.

This one in particular is one of the more ridiculous ones. Thinking that regular people are going to use a 'decentralised application' built on top of Ethereum that uses cryptocurrency over the legal betting that's presented to them is just laughable really. The only incentive that someone would have to do so is that they might be able to find better odds on a bet. But there would have to be liquidity in markets that have hundreds of races per day, and it would have to outweigh the cost of buying, dealing with, and selling cryptocurrency. And there are already legal regulated online options for people interested in finding better odds. Billion dollar companies that can also offer additional incentives to their players.
The set of conditions that would have to happen for this thing to gain any significant part of the horse racing market is incredibly unlikely.

If Wladimir won't merge any contentious change to Bitcoin, let alone a hard fork, then unless Jeff is planning on pulling an XT(and I don't think he is), I feel it's kind of a waste of time to discuss BIP100. If Wlad, Pieter, and Greg all continue to share the same concerns they have held regarding blocksize, BIP100 will continue to be contentious just as it has been since it was released months ago. 
If Wlad, Pieter, or Greg want to chime in here and say that they consider BIP100 a viable candidate to be merged at some point, then what I'm saying here is wrong of course. But from what I've read, as well as comparing Pieter's BIP, I don't think they're on the same page here at all.

I don't think so personally. Mining operations have become incredibly efficient, maximizing tech, scale, and geography to stay competitive.
I doubt that many people are going to mine unprofitably. If Bitcoin is so hard to obtain that people are reduced to doing this then we have bigger problems that need to be dealt with. Not to mention the minuscule amounts that BTC that anyone would realistically mine. Even if Bitcoin figures out a way to scale and sub-dollar microtransactions finally become viable for Bitcoin, there should be better ways to distribute micro amounts of BTC to people. Especially since you can include a very large number of outputs in one transaction.

Why does the title say that he embezzled 1.7 million pounds in BTC when the article goes on to state that he was transferring fiat out of the company account to buy a bunch of bullshit?
The title makes it sound like they caught him stealing BTC with evidence that would be on the blockchain. That would be a completely separate issue and have bigger implications.
When that Ashley person did his AMA he mentioned that Mark's personal account and Mt.Gox's account were one in the same. So Mark was probably just treating the fiat inside of it as his own money, leading to his arrest here. Having evidence that Mark was stealing Mt.Gox BTC itself would be a bigger deal, as it could be a first step towards finding out where the hell the Mt.Gox BTC actually went.

It was &gt;$1.00 for almost all of 2011. But the issue here is whether Bitcoin is being 'fought'. And thus far there's been little to no sign of any such thing happening. If the US or China, or even a private organization like a large bank wanted to attack Bitcoin they could easily do so. Even if Bitcoin switched mining algos every time it was attacked it would just be a war of attrition, and it won't take long before it's reduced to a shell of its former self. It's not like enough people are going to band together and use their own money to attempt to outspend a state, large bank, or similar organization.
Closing bank accounts or refusing service doesn't really qualify for 'fighting' in my opinion. That's gone on fairly consistently more or less for years now. Most of the time it's just because there hasn't been any regulatory guidance, so they just take the conservative route. Not that  I think that there should necessarily be more regulation or anything, but when there's a point where banks are confident they can legally deal with Bitcoin and make money at it they will. No one is going to take the offensive against Bitcoin anytime soon. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 22:11:38

That's a good idea but the amount of Bitcoin would have to fluctuate based on the BTC price, and stores aren't going to constantly update their pricing. It would have to be like a code redeemable for say $50 in BTC I think, and I like that idea much more than the mining angle personally.

Alright, that may very well be true. But in this context I'm specifically talking about Changetip. It's obviously better for them specifically relative to them maintaining their status quo. Certainly doesn't guarantee that they'll become profitable. But I believe adding this increases their chances, as it potentially greatly expands their market and their own market research strongly indicates that this is what their potential customer base wants.

I actually really, really hope that their pricing model works out. The current popular model of shitty sites funded by shady ads and paid articles is pretty bad. It would be a disappointing market failure if we didn't end up with some quality, ethical journalism. Even if it has to be crowdfunded or something to be sustained I hope it happens.

Seems a bit odd as Bitcoin isn't and never has been good with microtransactions(less than $1 say). Fees are a natural and necessary part of Bitcoin and limits the economics of sending small amounts of BTC.
So what's their angle here? Have they created their own Lightning Network type layer for Bitcoin? This is the first time I've seen anyone seriously proposing Bitcoin itself as a good solution for microtransactions. I thought that the strength was more about the fact that you can send $20 or $1,000,000 for the same fee more or less. It's great for large transactions, not so much for lots of smaller ones. I'm really pretty confused where this whole microtransaction thing is coming from. There must be something I'm missing because Bitcoin as it exists now just doesn't work that way. Something with payment channels or Lightning type tech? It has to be? They can't seriously be planning this for vanilla Bitcoin right?

If they have good intentions then it could just be a defensive move.

I remember when Deepbit had over 50% of the hashrate themselves. Times have changed I guess.
Ghash has also dropped a substantial amount making them virtually irrelevant when compared to before. Maybe exceeding 50% is mining pool suicide in the long run? Or perhaps associated farms or pools will never again solve blocks under a single IP/identity that can be shown to be producing half the blocks on the network. That's actually a worse situation, since you don't get the proper information. But it's to be expected I guess.

I think Bitgoldcoin was always where it was going to find its place in the financial system personally. It's not really designed for consumer payments or large scale replacement of existing systems. But it has characteristics similar to gold and a lot of additional flexibility and utility(vs gold as an asset, not considering industrial uses of gold). Which makes it a decent competitor with gold and other similar assets.

One thing I don't understand is why anyone from their target market is going to want to use a Raspberry Pi when they already have a superior computer that they're already using. I see that they're trying to supply some potentially interesting software here, but the miner and the Pi just seem superfluous. It's almost like they ended up with software as their main product, but they were funded as a hardware company so they felt obligated to wrap it up in hardware. 
@_date: 2015-09-27 12:53:43
If it's not open source, do you expect many people in this community will be interested anyway?
@_date: 2015-09-14 22:05:14
Yes, something like this could allow some who are unable to bet on horses to be able to. That is definitely one area where crypto can work well. That won't have any effect on the existing market itself though since those people can't participate in it either way. So it's certainly not "horse racing's worst nightmare" as the article states.
@_date: 2015-09-14 21:16:03
So why do you expect it to change now? Like I said in the post, alternative betting with better odds online has been available for probably close to 20 years now. 15 at least. I don't understand why people think that some decentralised application written on Ethereum is going to somehow change the status quo when there have been billion dollar gaming companies marketing their own platforms for years(including offering bonuses and other incentives). We're talking about average people going to an entertainment event choosing to use some Ethereum app over what's presented to them as the only option.
It seems like such a stretch to think that people are going to abandon the existing system when we've already seen well funded companies try to gain marketshare. Like honestly, what do people think the odds are are Augur providing a betting market that gains significant ground in the horse racing market? Someone should make a market for that because if people are seriously thinking that there's a good chance that's going to happen then I'd like to be the one to take contrary part of that market.

It's inevitable with a public ledger though. As long as it's not systematically built in to the protocol then it's just business as usual.
@_date: 2015-09-27 16:08:41
Except they're not generating satoshis locally since the blocks will still be solved by 21 Incs mining pool. They'll be generating shares which will entitle them to a portion of those blocks so still makes little sense.
21 Inc likely spent massive amounts of money fabricating ASICs which have turned out to be of little to no use to them outside their own mining operations. The fact that they're still clinging to the idea in late 2015 after two years is surprising to be honest. Perhaps justifying a pivot away from hardware and in to software is being resisted because they believe it will be difficult to monetize open source. I think at this point it's mostly clear that if this thing is going to be any good, it's going to be because the software they've written for it provides value.
@_date: 2015-09-11 16:09:18
The Fed did a report at some point an estimated around 400k I think.

Bitcoin would be nothing more than a toy at that point though. It would be similar to say most altcoins outside of the top ten or twenty.
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:12:34
I guess it all depends on whether or not their software stack is open source.
I have multiple computing devices already as I'm sure pretty much everyone in Bitcoin does as well. I also have no need to covert my electricity(which is fairly expensive per kWh to begin with) to a handful of satoshis per day since Bitcoin is pretty easy to obtain if needed for commerce. So if there's some nifty software that they've made that's going to make me want to use it, then obtaining the software and/or API key seems to be the rational move since I can't really see the need to buy custom hardware for something as universal as Bitcoin. Perhaps they've baked in all the benefits of their software into their hardware, in which case it's going to have to be some revolutionary software to justify spending $400 for an additional device that's going to be far less powerful than most peoples current computing devices.
People will probably be pretty mad if it's not open source. But on the other hand it doesn't appear that the hardware itself will provide much value with the information that's been make public so far. So it might be difficult for them to make a profit if everyone uses just their open source software and doesn't bother buying what appears to be mostly redundant hardware.
Looking forward to learning more about what exactly this thing offers. I'm also curious about who their target market is.
Also, they must have done something like perfect micropayment channels or some new LN type tech. Since Bitcoin itself has never been considered economically viable for microtransactions due to fees taking up a larger percent of the transaction the lower the value drops. And they seem to be pushing the micropayments thing as the game changer so I'm really curious on what they've come up with to make that work on a network that wasn't designed for micropayments.

The thing is from what I understand the vast majority of Chinese users strictly use it as more of a gambling game. I don't think many people ever withdraw their BTC from the exchanges that they use. And there seems to be very little actual Bitcoin usage in China.
Maybe there will be another bubble if the Chinese figure out that they can use Bitcoin for more than just trading.

I am posting this under a throwaway account to keep both myself and my source confidential. My source was contacted by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in regards to his activities involving the popular bitcoin trading platform Bitfinex. Attached is the screen shot of the email with sensitive information redacted:  I have checked out the inquiring CFTC official and the CC on the email, both do appear to work at the Chicago office of the CFTC, one as a trial attorney and one as an investigator. I have not gone and inquired beyond an internet search so there might be more digging to check for legitimacy but this is as far as I am comfortable going.
As far as the reason for the inquiry I do not want to go overboard with speculation and cause undue alarm to the community but I would venture to guess is has to with Bitfinex and their peer-to-peer swap facility. Even under a report by the CFTC from October 2014 they list Bitfinex as offering "total return swaps" which would place them under CFTC oversight.  Here is the full source of that pdf as well:  
Did anyone else get a similar email from the CFTC that cares to come forward? 
Is this a continuation of the crackdown on bitcoin related businesses? I will leave that up to you to speculate.

Why would Augur have much of an effect now when there's been alternative betting sites offering better odds almost as long as the internet has been around? Even p2p sites where people make their own markets. I highly doubt the average person who goes to bet on horses really cares about using some alternative system rather than just going up to the counter and buying their ticket.
What I would bet on Augur is that it's going to have little to no effect on horse racing or anything similar to that. People aren't going to start using cryptocurrency to bet on horses. Most people go for the entertainment, and part of that entertainment is buying and cashing those tickets there for actual cash. Not to mention the amount of liquidity they would need to make a decent horse racing betting market is huge. The network effect is working against them here, badly.

Wow. That is actually a very interesting point that I don't think I've ever seen mentioned in my many years reading about Bitcoin. I could have missed it, but it's definitely not something that comes up often.

It might be a combination of business stuff and open source, and I'm not sure on the exact situation. I just remember when he was hired that the wording made it sound like he would be given a lot of time to continue his work as a Bitcoin dev so to me that kind of implies that they wouldn't make him a critical part of their own development. I don't have any inside information or anything though, so I could be wrong here.

Realistically, how would he even do that? Say this guy has some amount of millions of dollars from the scam in his US bank account, what could he do to convert those in to BTC that wouldn't trigger the same warning that his China wire did?
On a separate but related topic, it makes me curious about just how easy it is for someone to buy millions worth of BTC in the US in general, scam or legitimate.

Why do you think that? I always had the impression he was hired as a service to the community and allowed to work on Core and other open source Bitcoin projects at his leisure. In a cost cutting layoff situation that's exactly the type of thing I would expect to go. Certainly doesn't reflect badly on Jeff or anything.

I agree with your general point but I also think there is potential for Bitcoin itself to become more fungible too. With some of the privacy stuff that gmaxwell is working on, CoinShuffle(not CoinJoin), and then other non-Monero projects focused on privacy(ZeroCash ect.), even if you think Monero is the favourite in the race, that's a far cry from 100% imo.

They also had Bitcoin integration for a long time until they ran in to technical issues or something(or just disabled it because no one was tipping in Bitcoin? Not sure what the real reason was tbh).
I don't think enough people in the world enjoy the idea of tipping. It turns a lot of people off. I think Pateron where you pay a set amount per month to fund someone you like is a better model personally. You can say it's similar, but I think the idea is different enough and creates a different social dynamic between the patron and creator.

Some people might argue that the better play would be to invest in Bitcoin itself, then fund things like Open Bazaar that have some chance to actually do something, unlike the vast majority of the shitty Bitcoin companies that get funded by VCs.
Not saying that this is definitely the case or anything. But the results of VC funding in Bitcoin companies is just embarrassing so far. It seems like it might just be a completely different paradigm and that funding good open source projects while buying BTC might just be a better investment in general.

I think there's a lot of potential in the area in general, I agree. But if I were doing it I'd try to get the phrase or idea of tipping away from it since it has a lot of negative connotations. The concept of a like-button as you said is a good one and someone will probably come along a do it well at some point. Maybe flattr will gain some momentum back at some point if their financial situation is stable(I don't know what their status is currently). The fact that they don't have any mention of the word 'tip' in their name is a good thing imo.

I wish I could find that article from 2013 where they recorded a huge list of big names and business leaders in Bitcoin and their predictions for the price in 2014. It's a total embarrassment, with people throwing out five figure predictions with high degrees of confidence like its nothing.
Any public figure in Bitcoin who goes around publicly making fantastic predictions about how the price is going to the moon in the near future immediately loses respect points from me. Tony from Bitpay is probably one of the worst, especially when you know that everything is riding on the BTC price being pumped for Bitpay. It's sad.
