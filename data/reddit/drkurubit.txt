@_date: 2012-04-06 21:48:18
Download it from cydia and its working amazingly I Iove it
@_date: 2012-03-05 16:24:03
yea, but the thing that still scares me the most is that for $100 i can recreate that power plus more in amazon ec2, i still think that a new and implrove version of ssl could be created
@_date: 2012-03-24 07:20:31
I got the email last and I order one let's see when they deliver
@_date: 2012-09-21 17:58:44

and thank you i hope it goes well.
@_date: 2012-03-20 03:01:33
I sell bitcoins and litecoins, but only take cc as payment once we have establish a relation. Many people will not do it du to  chargebacks
@_date: 2012-03-02 21:10:39
Things are not looking to well. Today I went beta with my app an I think because of the hacks yesterday it's not going to go to well for me
@_date: 2012-03-05 14:06:03
ssl really does not make a diference, ssl has been broken since it was first created, websites only use it for a pretty effect.
@_date: 2012-10-02 23:08:37
I been using bit instant for a while. And yesterday I tried bitfloor and withing I had my coins.  I used the deposit method at a bank
@_date: 2012-10-29 14:23:40
Im thinking about getting a few ones, may order them next month
@_date: 2012-10-31 19:37:21
Holy crap this is awesome
@_date: 2012-03-23 01:44:25
over the internet i have never done it, but in person a have sold bitcoins taking the credit card payment using square up 
@_date: 2012-09-19 22:55:50
I purchase two last week still waiting 
@_date: 2012-03-05 15:10:49
Instead of me telling you, and then you telling me how i suck, just read a few articles.
Also i been working in the IT field for 10 years now, and have alot of experience with sll, and it always fails to do its job. Think of it as Java it was a really good idea but really did not deliver what they said they would.
@_date: 2012-10-29 01:44:56
Yea 6 week wait
@_date: 2012-05-21 08:36:25
Any chance you can share the presentation I would live to see it
@_date: 2012-04-04 09:06:10
The solo miners people who mine for them self and not under any pool network.
@_date: 2012-03-10 02:09:33

@_date: 2012-11-30 12:16:23

@_date: 2012-10-29 14:24:25
The bad thing about there customer support is, that for 6 weeks i got no follow up or status update, no email or phone calls where being answer 
@_date: 2012-03-01 16:40:11
i dont use them so i did not really get it, lol
@_date: 2012-03-03 14:51:35
Thats they way i want to do it, a user opens up a savings account, then another user ask for a loan, we give that user the loan using the btc from saving accounts, then the interest that is charge for the loan, goes into the saving accouunt what we use for loan.
@_date: 2012-03-06 15:05:19
hey sorry about that, you must have register when i was changing to the deployment servers, no its officialy deploy when you open an account pm your info and amount you lost.
@_date: 2012-10-01 01:59:08
So far  has been the best way to get bitcoins. At least in my opinion. Good luck :)
@_date: 2012-03-03 20:28:41
Thank you, since the code is mostly made up of many open source projects I will be making it open source but in the future where I have rewriting everything that could be use to harm the site, once the official beta opens tomorrow I would for people to test out the site. Don't need to be big transactions that was tested in trstnet and works great.  But test with real bit cents and make sure the addresses are correctly implemented 
@_date: 2012-03-03 12:39:35
it's bitsutoa.com currently running on testnet. It's an online wallet that will work like a bank with loans. Savings account with interest and payment API for merchants
@_date: 2012-09-21 04:11:29
Last week I order 2. I'm freaking out now
@_date: 2012-03-03 14:24:41
Thank you doktorlaser, if you need coins to test just reply with your address. Im thinking having free service for the start and then work out how to make a revenue to make it bigger and better. currently its just me doing all the development and paying everything so i would like to bring others to work with me and make it beter.
@_date: 2012-10-30 21:59:06
i like it
@_date: 2015-09-14 14:42:02
So they use Colohouse in Miami, probably just reselling the service they provide. Ive been in that facility, its nothing special.
