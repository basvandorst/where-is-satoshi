Is it a good thing for a currency to have extremely rapid deflation? Can I get a put option on bitcoin?

certainly there must be a cap to a speculative bubble on a currency? Where is this money coming from?
Say you buy a coin for $1000. The next day you sell it for $5k. Where did those $4K actually come from? Did it come from 4 other buyers who bought at the same time? If so what prevents a run on the bank? It has the makings of a Ponzi- scheme
 I just honestly don't have the stomach for daily valuation changes on the hundreds of dollars. You haven't MADE anything until that USD is in your bank account.

Just because there is limited supply doesn't mean it has intrinsic value. 
Gold doesn't have nearly a fraction of the value it holds. It has intrinsic value as a precious metal that can be used in industrial applications and in small quantities in jewelry but no way in hell that value is thousands of dollars an ounce. That is pure speculation. When the end of days comes for fiat currency, the value of gold will drop to pennies.
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. I can go into my garage and make 23 unique bent nails. Say you have  one or two stores in town that take bent nails. Now you have thousands of people suddenly speculating that those bent nails are worth huge sums of money. 
Without the speculation you just have 23 bent nails that have very very close to a value of $0

It's certainly not a long-term investment. If every owner sold their bitcoin for cash it would be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Is there actually that much value to that currency? 
If every person pooled their bitcoin buying power (not USD, but actually what you can buy online with a bitcoin) Can all of bitcoin actually purchase the equivalent of the entire airline industry?  Their Market Caps are getting close.

I suppose that is true. However, it seems like there is no actual value being created. If I purchase a gallon of milk with bitcoin and tomorrow that gallon of milk is worth a fraction of what I paid for it. What is the incentive to ever utilize the currency? What is the normalization point? at what point does this become a viable currency?
