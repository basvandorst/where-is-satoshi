At full adoption it won't matter how many dollars a Bitcoin is worth because you won't have any use for dollars.

Yes, it is a concern, especially with the new Spectre attacks

"Look, having bitcoin — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you’re a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the bitcoin deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are — crypto is so powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right, who would have thought? — but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us, this is horrible."

It depends on where you live, the amount in question, and the ATM operator.
In the US, there are strict Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) laws that can be triggered which require more verification.
$200 may only require sms verification 
$1,200 may require govt issued ID (drivers license, etc)
$50 the atm operator may require you to create an account with their service before you can use it
Fees are typically around 8-10%
google "bitcoin atm map" for more info

Retailers are smart enough to avoid bitcoin cache

security experts - "don't write down passwords, it makes them insecure"
bitcoin "experts" - "paper is secure"
Paper may reduce your attack surface from digital attacks but doesn't eliminate physical attacks.
The only data that can't be hacked is data that doesn't exist.

I still think you are conflating two ideas.
If currency doesn't excite you, you will never find anything exciting in bitcoin.
And a sub dedicated to a currency isn't necessarily going talk about other things that are using the blockchain. You might find more exciting content in The pie in the sky stuff has always been about the blockchain. Crypto is the killer app\proof of concept.
 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:35:15
You do not have to buy whole bitcoins. You buy in increments of  0.00000001

Just a basic understanding of math will do. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:39:35
What were you expecting? Bitcoin is currency and most of its use cases just aren't really that exciting. Should this sub be filled with "I just bought a doughnut with bitcoin!!!!"? 
I think people who want to talk about the tech should be focused on interesting uses of the blockchain.

Consider this: it worked. They used to call them "bag holders" now they call them "bag hodlers"

I'm taking issue with the idea that a particular investment will always go up. 
I'm personally a big believer in crypto but not so blinded that I cannot see a future where is just doens't work out.

Anyone who must make the claim that "I am not an idiot" is almost guaranteed to be an idiot. Non-idiots just don't have to do that because no one is questioning their intelligence.
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:46:20
I never said it would go either way. I said no one knows. You have a real problem with reading comprehension.

LifeProTip: substantive articles and anecdotes don't need clickbait titles. It cheapens the message because there is a hidden agenda.

I've got bad news for you...

There is no actual reason to think this is real either. It's lame propaganda IMO

Multiple people are calling you out for making up arguments that dont exist. You need professional help
[example 1](

You are the one who can't remember what you said or how to read the first 6 characters of a post you are replying to. Learn to read dipshit.

I hodl. I like Bitcoin. I just don't live in fairy land where Bitcoin will always increase in value. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:08:04
How many times do you have to be called out before you admit you can't handle basic conversation?
@_date: 2019-01-12 04:39:26
Stamped steel (like dog tags). 
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:00:25
You are arguing a point you made up. How can anyone be this stupid?
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:24:32
It isn't smart to argue against verifiable facts. Jan 17 2018 bitcoin was at $11,141.25.

I am a software engineer who makes a lot more that 19/hr ;)
I also have many coins and alts.  
You have a severe and profound blindspot. It could all crash tomorrow and all of your fake posturing and wild claims will do nothing to stop it. You are the worst part of the community. You add nothing because you know nothing. You are a parrot and will speak anytime a cracker is put in front of you.
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:16:54
This is pure fiction. None of this happened.

If the guy is treating like an investment, we are going to talk about it as an investment. 
It could go up or down. It could also hover indefinitely. Nobody knows what it will do so trying to claim I am wrong is absurd. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:32:29
9 years isn't a long time. I've lived through many "guaranteed" investments. You are lucky today. Not smart. Lucky. If Bitcoin dropped to zero we would point and laugh at you. Enjoy it while it lasts. Idiot.

Reddit as a whole is really dumb and anyone who follows the "wisdom" deserves what they get

Fun fact: if we had this conversation two months ago, I'd be right about the price dropping.

Things that have value will NEVER be immune to greed or leverage. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:52:59
Look, you need to learn how to read. Grab your favorite crayon and have an adult explain it to you. You've been called out twice for arguing things people haven't said. How are this stupid? I'm starting to think you may have a mild form of retardation.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:58:17
I'm just saying that healthy adults don't go around telling people they aren't idiots. It really seems like you are overcompensating.

How did he make them look like fools?
@_date: 2019-09-13 13:24:22
So he can get internet points without actually having to show his work.

He already backed out of the deal. No need to ever mention him again.
