Who will be the second “coinbase”?  I think a huge solution to this problem is another exchange becoming an easily accessible website &amp; mobile app that a majority can understand and use.

Sorry to hear about this.  I really hope this doesn't happen to my BoA account :(
@_date: 2017-01-08 17:44:59
I agree, all of my questions I've taken to and I've gotten great help and friendly responses.  
@_date: 2017-08-10 05:11:50
But Shopify wouldn't be able to take the flat % fee. So I don't understand why they would allow it.  
Worth looking more into though.

I'm wondering when it will drop...
Lol jk who cares - HODL

Is this chart just comparing BTC's use to other coins?  Somewhat confused.
@_date: 2016-12-30 14:05:59
Well if it isn't in hard storage, what wallet do you suggest?
@_date: 2016-12-27 03:26:30
Where would you recommend I look for cold storage?  Not as familiar in this compared to short term selling. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 13:25:35
I was always under the impression that I can keep a small amount of coins in an account online (on the account you purchased them from).  Using two way authenticators and so on seemed safe enough for a small amount of coins.  
I have come to find out this is wrong, but this is also brings up a new side of BTC that I'm not so familar with.  Does anyone have suggestions/advice/links for long term safe storage? 
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:55:14
Can you elaborate?  I don't quite understand Halving.
@_date: 2016-12-26 13:22:05
So keeping coins in an online location such as Coinbase's "Vault" isn't recommended?
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:36:14
I currently can't purchase a large amount, instead I just buy the small amounts that I can in hopes that a few years down the road, it pays off.
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:22:46
Would it be recommended to get my money out of Coinbase ASAP?
@_date: 2016-12-31 17:10:15
My first purchase :)
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:32:57
Merry Christmas! 
Even if it hits $1,000 I'll still hold on to them....can't give em up yet ;)
@_date: 2016-12-25 20:14:40
Gotcha, but I feel like the halving would be a temporary market change, or does it last for a good bit of time? 
Also for the future, the miner would essentially have to pay a higher cost in power for the same amount of BTC.
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:41:40
So purchasing a device such as KeepKey or Trezor will be my safest (and easiest) bet at protection? 
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:47:04
Maybe I shouldn't wait....I'm holding a lot of USD waiting for BTC to drop...
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:58:06
I feel like it's smarter to approach this as a long-term investment. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:55:20
Can you elaborate?  I don't quite understand Halving.
@_date: 2016-12-31 17:24:31
I expect it to drop again, the question is just when and by how much. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:27:11
I was declined in the verification process. I don’t know why exactly. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:43:10
Well proper cooling will stop this right?
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:27:08
Does mining really depreciate the lifetime of your hardware that fast?
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:02:05
Thanks for making this list!..or finding it.  Either way it helped a ton!
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:21:52
Thanks asshole I was asking for help.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:43:53
Well I have a 650 watt power supply...I'd imagine that that's enough.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:23:15
You would be my first transaction! :)
