Ledger is great.  I have one as well and it was simple to setup if you just follow the instructions.  In a nutshell, you just download the Ledger app on your PC, connect the ledger, create a PIN on it then write your 24 word seed.  
To access the wallet you just run the app on your PC, plug in your ledger, enter the PIN, and your wallet will show on screen.  From there you set it to receive BTC, then you can send your BTC to it from whatever exchange you got BTC from.  
You can use any exchange to see your BTC value, you don't need to have your BTC on any other wallet to do this.  It will vary slightly from exchange-to-exchange, but you'll always have an idea of how much it's worth.
You can always move it back to an exchange if you want to trade it back to fiat (USD/Euro/etc).  Though the idea of BTC is that you hold onto it and there will be a point where you won't need to trade it back, but that's on you of course of how you want to use BTC.

If you want to avoid fees from transfers, leave it on the exchange and just wait until you get your ledger to do a single transfer to it.

I was surprised at how easy it was to transfer my crypto to my Ledger.  I had set aside time to do it and expected to be sitting there fiddling for a while, but did it in about 15 minutes and was unsure what to do with myself lol.  
Required my computer, the chrome app, and the ledger.

Whoa how did that happen?  I got mine a few weeks ago for $75.

Go to coinbase.  You'll see the address there.
Or in GDAX, click transfers in the upper right after picking an account, you'll get the BTC transaction hash.  Search that on blockchain and you'll see the address.
Ex:

Deposit to GDAX first.  Plug in your ledger, input PIN, boom you have an address to send to from GDAX.

Incredibly.  Login to GDAX with your coinbase account, deposit all of your BTC, then send it to your Ledger wallet address. Done.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:44:51
Just go to "Deposit" on GDAX and pick your coinbase wallet.  No fee.

I mean, by this logic you could just use it to win the lottery... or invest in google, facebook etc

Just go back to 2000 and invest every penny you've got into Enron.
