But cheat on your tax and be in trouble for life 
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:52:49
Shush you! I fomo'd at 8100. Feels bad man 
@_date: 2018-08-01 09:11:25
Congrats. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:45:56
Well fuck, I bought 0.44 bitcoin for over $3000, fml
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:59:25
Like filthy rich?
A house, a new Volvo V90, a vacation to the Maldives or something, and a banging stereo.
Realistically I hope to afford to cash out a car in 3-5 years ��
@_date: 2018-08-02 12:13:31
Pfffff, try $3400 at 8100.. I'm not worried though 
@_date: 2018-08-01 11:18:55
How did it taste? 
@_date: 2018-08-10 16:43:50
Uhhm... This is good for bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:58:48
One of the first things I googled after I read about bull and bear markets. I mean, how can you not? 
@_date: 2018-08-05 03:24:59
Tales from your ass
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:05:59
Sorry, but gently fuck off with this elitism 
@_date: 2018-08-01 07:25:14
You have any advice for someone who fomo'd at 8100? I feel I still should DCA a bit 
@_date: 2018-08-01 08:24:09
Food for thought for those with current anxiety attacks
“When there is hype, people are irrationally exuberant. When there is despair, people are irrationally pessimistic. Neither is true. Reality is always somewhere in the middle, more correlated with real usage (transactions per day) than the price,” he added, “We use the down cycles to build a strong foundation so we can thrive in the next growth cycle.”
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:01:53
Will the bulls keep us above $7500? Upvote for yes, downvote for no 
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:20:21
I sold my $12000 stereo to invest in crypto lol.
Nah, I won't sell my stack just to buy a car that plummets in value.
I dunno really. Right now I'd feel contempt living my current life, but with enough money to never have to worry about expenses again. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 19:49:05
Also cocain 
@_date: 2018-08-02 19:40:27
Try localbitcoins.com. Someone might sell over PayPal 
@_date: 2018-08-01 07:55:32
He doesn't know.. 
@_date: 2019-06-06 20:15:09
I did my part
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:54:14
Whales want to see more vegata meems
@_date: 2019-06-16 09:27:35
It wasn't. I almost sold 10% at 9k
@_date: 2019-06-06 18:17:38
How do you see this? Asking for a friend
@_date: 2019-06-15 12:35:35
Slow and steady wins the race. This is better than rising 1k in a minute
@_date: 2019-04-29 12:46:53
I'd hodl and wait for a bit. We might not have seen the full effects of the tether fiasco.
@_date: 2019-04-09 08:02:37
Will it drop or should I just fomo what scrapes I have left now? Someone look into their crystal ball
@_date: 2019-04-18 11:26:20
If you want something "safe" I'd go with ETH then.
@_date: 2019-04-29 13:24:31
Yes, we should wait and see how Bitfinex reacts
@_date: 2019-04-18 10:26:41
The answer is still bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:59:19
I predict end of 2021.
@_date: 2019-04-18 20:38:55
Isn't the volume weirdly low for pushing 5k3?
@_date: 2019-04-19 06:33:42
What exchange should one use to buy and sell then?
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:44:29
Good luck with that
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:45:59
We might drop below 5k again when we right 6k. The selling pressure will be immense. But we might not..
@_date: 2018-07-25 11:19:20
What if it goes to the moon and back again and you miss it? WHAT THEN? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:03:34
People who got rich off of crypto, ie not me. Hahaha 
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:08:24
I fomoed bad. Can't wait for the regret when ETF doesn't pass. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 21:16:33
Everything is obvious after the fact. I hate myself for not mining, buying and obtaining a shitload of btc in its infancy, and selling at ATH in dec. It all seems so simple now, but I know I'd never have the patience to wait long enough to maximise profit. Ah well, at least I'm here now. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 06:10:31
I can give you 17 cents 
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:47:29
Hold that thought
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:35:11
Make it stop :(
@_date: 2018-07-18 09:32:52
We going doooown bois
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:43:23
Thanks for the mental support 
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:27:53
WHERE IS THE DAILY CHAT? 
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:45:11
Please elaborate 
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:54:01
As I joined in on this madness just yesterday I only have 0.17 bitcoin. Watching my portfolio during family dinner today was a mixed emotion of "fuck yeeeah" and "why the fuck didn't I buy more"..
I'm in it for the long haul, so I think I'm gonna buy that remaining 0.83 coin ASAP. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:24:33
Reads like wishful thinking ��
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:49:25
I'm not entirely sure what's going on. Are bears trying to bring the price down, but bulls prevent it? Are bulls trying to bring the price up, but bears prevent it? Are both bulls and bears happy with going sideways for a while? 
What's the way out of this stagnation? Big news and huge investments that bears can't sell wall? Or, help me, bad news that bull's won't/can't buy wall? 
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:40:52
I predict 1 000 000 wuuut
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:48:21
Why for tomorrow? 
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:37:52
Say we go to the moon, what's the best way to unload fast and simple? Coinbase Pro?
I will always HODL, but if it gets crazy not more than 75%.
@_date: 2018-07-25 16:30:42
I'd need 10 bitcoin for 100k to be "enough" lol
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:24:04
You're telling me I'm smarter than a millionaire for investing early-ish? 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:56:42
I'll buy your bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-17 12:03:53
With my €1200 investment I'm hoping for more than 10% a year long term lmao 
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:49:18
I'm curious. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:00:57
$ 1500 actually 
@_date: 2018-07-19 07:34:59
I'll leave day trading for the professionals 
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:27:18
Hope you get this resolved OP. I felt brave doing a $3600 deal on lbc.
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:00:09
He's actually serious. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:53:43
I'd like nothing more, but explain me how and why 
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:50:32
Good advice, thanks 
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:59:21
Oh booy $7500 here we go 
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:29:46
Define fast? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 08:23:58
Sort of what I'm hoping for with my $1600 portfolio.
See you in 2032!
@_date: 2018-07-19 10:53:50
Haha, Way ahead of you. Even selling my $11000 stereo to invest in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:00:05
That's an interesting perspective, thanks 
@_date: 2018-07-19 21:02:00
What did it say? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:36:50
Nah, you'd need a big Volvo, atleast
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:02:16
Can't find it ��
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:35:37
Pm me your account info bro, I'll take care of them for you 
@_date: 2018-07-18 21:18:02
Six figures, Holy lambo... I'll never reach anything close to that, but thanks for the tip. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:39:25
Can't afford titanium 
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:45:27
What did you do? 
@_date: 2018-07-29 09:12:43
Can I have one year? 
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:12:52
I hope it does ��
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:22:45
I'll never have a bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-07-19 09:49:06
I won't mind if they wait a few months, so that I can at least own 1 bitcoin when we go to the moon 
@_date: 2018-07-24 10:16:07
@_date: 2018-07-16 09:36:04
Why is this? 
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:44:51
Based on feelings? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:48:23
To shreds you say.. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 01:23:10
Coinbase 
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:03:25
Bullish. In for 100k
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:55:16
Haha, damn. I fomo'd pretty bad just below $8100 too. Can't wait till I'm rich, cause that's the only time I'll dare to tell my girlfriend how insane I am. ��
Did you upvote the money cat on the front page yesterday? 
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:38:00
And here I'm feeling bad for not investing more while it was $6300. I fomo'd most of my holdings at $8050 a few days ago. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:20:57
Use kraken? 
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:03:44
Explain how, lmao 
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:00:41
Why is $6800 the magical limit? 
@_date: 2018-07-27 14:13:24
No shortage of poeple who bought close to ATH.. And you can sell to exchanges at whatever price, no? 
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:18:12
He sodld, nothing to worry about 
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:30:39
Such a small amount isn't really noticeable, so no worries if it crashes in the near future.
What does worry me a bit is if we have a huge spike in a year or two, followed by a huge crash.
I don't know how I would deal with such emotion lmao
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:39:35
Tell me more 
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:08:23
I'm getting old. Five years is like one year. No problem. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 09:38:07
I want one full bitcoin more than I want a Lambo 
@_date: 2018-07-19 10:16:02
Lol. I'll send bitcash
@_date: 2018-07-18 06:49:22
That's some fine advice if I ever heard one :) 
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:46:03
Invest $1000 or no? Whew..
@_date: 2018-07-25 16:52:06
How can you talk like this a sure thing?
@_date: 2018-07-27 08:28:51
Still feeling bullish
@_date: 2018-07-18 06:02:06
If you're on android the official reddit app works. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:05:58
When I get my lambo the number plate will read "0.5 Bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-07-25 11:15:26
Lmao, how much? 
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:30:59
No worries, it's just that I get the shakes when I can't see the daily chat 
@_date: 2018-07-25 11:15:50
Based on what?? 
@_date: 2018-07-18 09:51:14
1 karma = 1 bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-19 09:34:29
Just as broke as yesterday
Edit: Still in the green though
And you? 
@_date: 2018-07-16 10:43:47
Should I start investing $123 every month?
It's not much, I don't expect to get rich.
But I do believe. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 10:15:53
I still haven't seen red on my initial bitcoin investment. Started this week, lol. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 06:04:19
What is enough? I have 0.2 bitcoin and was mad as hell when it spiked yesterday. Now I'm too scared to buy more. Come on, please dip. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:13:32
Shit, I've done this.. Is it that big a risk? Not keeping my crypto on the exchange though
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:29:35
5 times every hour
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:43:31
In it for the big money huh
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:12:22
I feel like the S is more secure. Isn't the X Bluetooth or something?
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:47:06
Where and why?
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:11:56
F :(
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:49:55
Good luck buying at those prices
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:33:46
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:08:12
I'm guessing that includes usdc
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:19:52
Three days ago I was up $1700. Today, after a horrible attempt at getting rich quick and btc dropping, I'm up $200.
Lesson learned. Some advice if you are new here: Buy the dips and hold.
