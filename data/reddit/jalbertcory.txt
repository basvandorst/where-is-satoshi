I used to have this issue, then I realized that plugging the wallet in, then starting the wallet program, then opening the app on the wallet was the perfect order.  I used to open the app on the wallet before I had it open on my computer.  This seems to make the program miss the open signal from the wallet or something.  Anyway using that order it always works so I stick to it.  Switching wallets I leave the app on the ledger, then switch programs if I need, then open the app on the wallet that I want.

Blockfolio is the best app for this that I have found.  Supports almost ever alt coin as well.

No.  Not until tomorrow, and even then it really is only a big deal the day after.  ACH has a variable amount of time out takes depending on when your order hit it.

I got wrecked by a scam with my ledger wallet, couldn't double spend there either.  Basically my only negative Bitcoin experience.  Wish I had thought to use my seed elsewhere in time.

Cable bill counts too.  That's what I used.  Only useful thing Comcast ever did for me.

Bitcoin Checker on Android.  It's simple and clean.

I am in this boat as well.  Fun to watch my negative ROI work back to 0 though.
We will get our chance, either the inauguration or the etf will bring it back above 1000.

Jokes on me, I deposited to bitfinex.  Didn't realize it's 20 confirmations.  Going to die before that happens.

Decent plan.  I would make sure you know everything that you can about each alt you are investing into.  The last two I would personally skip, but everyone believes in different things.  Maybe look into ripple or it's close stellar.  I don't believe that they are great coins in the end but they will probably make you money.

$410... I mean I get wanting to use retirement funds to buy btc, but at that markup, just take the tax hit and buy the coins for real.

No downsides except the time it takes for the transfers.  You might end up losing money depending on the time it takes for the transfer to happen.  And it is going to look mad sketchy to your bank so good luck with that.  Remember to pay your taxes on the profit if you do it.  Unlike holding, each time you buy/sell you are responsible for the tax on the profit.

This so much.
