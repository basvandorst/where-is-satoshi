A lot of these scams do make people money. Pay a small number of people at the beginning, and the masses buy in. It's how Ponzi schemes stay afloat.
But I'd be willing to bet that a much higher number of people here who claim to be profitable aren't actually. They've heavily reinvested into more imaginary miners or imaginary hashpoints. (after all, GAW's CEO fraudulently promised them that hashpoints "will be a the greatest return ever seen in crypto.") Their account has value on paper, but once GAW goes belly up, or everyone else tries to cash out, they won't be able to.

It's just suspicious when a blogger who is supposed to know about cryptocurrency entirely takes Josh's word on everything. For example, he could have easily checked the mining addresses that Josh provided, only to find that there isn't any mining connected to them. Or he could have asked to see the inside of the 150,000-square foot warehouse instead of settling for a lease. The article acts like it proves a bunch of things, but if anything, raises more questions. It is very well written, and even I felt somewhat convinced while reading it - it's just that the facts are wrong, and it doesn't actually address any issues. 
You were right to call me out on saying that it was paid blog post, and I appreciate that you did. It just seems very much like the author was doing Josh a favor. Considering the popularity of the posts, I hope that he will take the time to revisit the issue and objectively explore some of the glaring issues and inconsistencies surrounding GAW.

It's not slander if it's true.

Did you... did you read their whitepaper? It's so bad that it's funny. Every buzzword that they could think of, incomplete sentences, and this coming is from a company which has already made multiple basic programming errors that have caused large financial losses in their current system. But they think that they're going to overtake not just Bitcoin, but the entire financial world? Yeah ok.

Well, we know that Josh has paid and given gifts to Bitcoin "journalists" before. We also know that he is paying a PR company, issues paid press releases, pays his forum members to write favorably about him, he pads his social media accounts with paid followers, and he has personally been caught pretending to be fake users on Reddit and BitcoinTalk. No doubt he and his team are doing this in the WSJ comments as well. 
Both WSJ blog posts about GAW serve only to promote the scam, and only attempt to debunk criticisms rather than actually investigating them. They also completely ignore huge warning signs about the legitimacy of GAW. Considering all the red flags, no aspect of GAW should be taken at face value, and the WSJ blogger managed to take everything at face value.
It is apparent that either the WSJ blogger has some type of incentive to write favorably about GAW, or he hasn't taken to the time to actually look into the company, in which case he shouldn't be writing about them at all.

Garza is scared shitless of this. If you don't believe me, have a look at his post where he tries to brush it off and tries to tell us that the SEC won't bother to do anything if we report him. 
He has also acknowledged that he's running unregistered securities. Garza and his team are fucked, and I only feel sorry for the people who have fallen for his scam - even the people who continue to promote it.
@_date: 2014-11-08 22:06:11
So many choices. Fraudcoin sounds good, but then again, Scamcoin has a nice ring to it. I think a Ponzicoin has already been made, but then so has a Hashcoin. Josh Garza is a visionary, so he'll probably come up with something creative like FuckoverGAWcustomersCoin.

This seems to be a theme in discussions about GAW:
Normal person: "Here is some evidence to suggest that GAW is scamming people."
Hashtalk user: "But where is the evidence!"
Normal person: "I... just showed you evidence. But ok, here is some more."
Hashtalk user: "WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE!"

You know what would turn me off to cryptocurrency? Jumping in by investing $1,000 in GAW's Hashlets, only to earn a tenth of a penny per year in mining payouts. (Yes those are actual payouts at current rates from GAW.) Surely the payouts will rise once the Paycoin phase of the Ponzi goes online though.

Stop reading if you want, but GAW is a textbook Ponzi:




@_date: 2014-11-26 21:20:11
It's really irresponsible of GAW to be taking on so many new scams without finishing some of their old ones first.
@_date: 2014-11-26 05:50:10
If only the real world worked the way Hashtalk does. Keep searching for that 'ban' button, Homero!
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:38:21
Reminder: Josh Garza has guaranteed profitability to all Hashlet owners. If you have been paid back less money than you've paid to GAW, Josh Garza owes you money and you have the right to take legal action against his company.

The truth that GAW's entire cloud mining scheme has been a charade. In fairness to Josh, that's a pretty big trade secret.
@_date: 2014-11-25 22:19:08
When a company does something unethical, you are actually allowed to talk about it on the internet. (unless you're on Hashtalk or the GAW Miners subreddit)
You've admitted to having money tied up in this company. It's in your financial interest to keep the scam running. Don't act like your defense of them is about anything other than that.

- WSJ blogger with a blog that nobody reads (Look at the comment count of the other articles) and who wrote an ad for GAW a few days earlier, and takes Josh's word on everything he says.
- Claims to have have proof of mining addresses, but there is no mining or mined blocks connected to the addresses - they are just stored customers' funds.
- Claims to have proof of a mining facility, but has only seen a lease. GAW will however, conveniently allow him to see pictures of a facility being built. Shit is hitting the fan with GAW and they figure maybe they better actually have some real mining going on if they want their scam to last. 
Anyone else find it a little weird that GAW's maintenance fees are so high that they claim that it costs more to run their miners than they're earning, (and can't pay their customers anything) and yet they've decided it's a good idea to start building a mining facility despite rising difficulty?
And where is the rest of this media blitz that we were promised? All we got is a couple ~~paid~~ blog posts and a press release. I'm guessing that the real journalists took one look at GAW and decided, "Nope! We can't in good conscience write an ad for these guys."

It seems like you tried to remain objective, but in fairness, the fourth sentence of the article is: "At Coin Brief, we have supported GAW since they were first selling Scrypt ASICs."

"Give me your money now, and in one month's time, I will give you back a million billion dollars. I'll tell you how and why I'm doing it, but not until after you give me your money. lol." ~ Josh Garza (paraphrased)

Says the guy fanatically supporting a known Ponzi.

Imagine a bank account where you have to give your principal to the bank (permanently) in order to receive the interest payments from that principal. Now imagine that those interest payments are given to you in a currency that is taken less seriously than the Zimbabwean dollar. That is basically what HashStaker is.
Edit: It looks like I misread the some of the marketing fluff. Hashstaker is a wallet... So GAW wants to charge people thousands of dollars to store their coins for them with PoS. All I can say is... what the fuck?? I've only ever felt bad for GAW's customers, but now I'm almost at the point where I feel like people deserve to lose their money if they're buying this crap.

Unfortunately they won't be rejecting the sponsorship. GAW's scam victims' money is just too good to pass up.
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:48:13


Do you know what "sponsorship" means? It means you're promoting the company. 
GAW is proven to be a scam that has defrauded people out of millions of dollars. As long as GAW is a sponsor, your role is at least partially to promote a scam.

It's $30k that should be returned to the customers that it belonged to before GAW Ponzi schemed it away from them.
