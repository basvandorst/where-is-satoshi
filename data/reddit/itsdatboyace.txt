It's not silly if he didn t have the spare change to buy more at the time but wanted to. I don't understand why so many people linger around here just to be negative to anyone that's bullish on the subject.

@_date: 2018-01-17 06:20:32
Okay, I may have been under the wrong assumption and was mislead by something I read.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:28:39
Done what exactly?
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:44:02
And from what I understand this particular future speculation closes tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:45:33
I'm as bullish on BTC as someone could reasonably be, but who says they're not re-evaluating? Or even changing their mind entirely?
It's not like they'd announce their feelings to everyone before selling out. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:57:33
I cannot believe these are actually people's reactions. On REDDIT. After all the knowledge you have available to you.
It's still a 50/50 shot at what happens next, just like it always has been. Nobody knows. But it's much more likely than you think to stick around and get stronger. At this point in the game it makes no sense for it to hit the type of "bear market" it's seen in the past. 
As software developments and communities push for widespread adoption, they're making buying BTC simple with an easy UI, same with purchasing WITH BTC. In two years there will be all kinds of vendors accepting it, and it will be a VERY convenient payment option. Of course that's not set in stone but in my opinion it's very likely. Crytpo is going places and BTC is the forerunner. But seriously, there are way too many people with extensive economic/technological knowledge that predict BTC is in its infancy in terms of adoption. 
Don't panic sell. But whatever, honestly, won't affect things for me one way or another. Don't believe the people around here trying to make you panic. Most of them are alt coin shills, but there's some other strange things going on with the comments as well. Don't know how long you've been around but dig a little deeper dude. This volatility is nothing new, at all. It's blowing my mind people are panicking. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:52:06
Right, if you think crypto is dying in GENERAL, as your post implies, you're on one. Even the major banking institutions know crypto isn't going anywhere. And there are at least a few coins leading the charge. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:28:13
What? I'm not sure what you're even trying to say. The people betting on these futures are not able to manipulate the prices to this extent in almost any other market. This is a rarity. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:23:00
There's not a single person with any knowledge and experience with economics and this particular industry that believes that bitcoin is hanging it up for good. You think people that are purchasing BTC are delusional, but really you are. See you in a couple of months. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:21:40
Yea I think this whole thing is going to shed some of the shitcoins, this is good in the grand scheme of things.
Honestly this whole ordeal has just proved that every other coin is completely at the mercy of BTC. At this point, so far. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:21:21
Get off your high horse.
You're just as ignorant as I am.
Edit: Just a joke about his name, sheesh.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:17:20
Someone's just having fun with this shit now. Good god. Flat out toying with the prices. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:59:25
Good thing that's not going to happen. Jesus, from the worldwide concurrent transactions and people using it as a currency ALONE it wouldn't drop to levels you're talking about, much less people who have bought it as a store of value for when transactions are more practical for every day use. The technology is being worked on by some of the best out there, you think these people are pouring their heart and souls into something that has a greater chance than not of collapsing? 
Let me give you a hint, you don't know something that every one else in the world does not. You're not that cynical genius or whatever silly shit you see yourself as. There is an extremely low probability that bitcoin collapses to near nil, there are way too many market places heavily invested in it. Then you see news like the big Japanese exchange opening up for BTC trade, and Goldman Sachs looking into BTC trading. 
Honestly you're out of your goddamn mind. There's no guarantee that it's "going to the moon" and all of that, but there are plenty of opportunities for it to hit a gold-like appropriation world wide. There are a WHOLE lot of senior economic speculators predicting it. You're going to be feeling pretty silly in 2 years when BTC is going strong. Mark my words.
Edit: With the dependency that all blockchain alts have on bitcoin, not to mention the name brand recognition, there's no way that BTC isn't leading the charge as far as cryptos are concerned. I can tell you're hedging your bets and hoping it fails, you've got your own agenda so you'll never accept it until it happens and you're left sitting in your own pile of shit. There are so many different groups working on implementing the lightning network and making a user friendly UI for your average joe. It's going to take a bit of marketing at some point for bitcoin to go MAJORLY mainstream. I mean seriously, look at the way Mcdonald's got started. Ray Croc loved it not just for its 'technology,' but the name. The name meant everything. And bitcoin is THE name of crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:40:00
Good possibility they're harnessing that storm, though? I mean I'm as skeptical as the next guy when it comes to this type of thing but the evidence has been stacking
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:47:26
That's no joke. I've been seeing the sickening shit pouring out of CNBC. They leave out a majority of the pertinent information when it comes to crytpos, but especially BTC. IMO for BTC to gain full blown mainstream traction at some point in the future, it's going to take a big marketing push by SOMEONE. It's not hard to do, it's just that someone's going to have to do it. The name needs to get out there, or it maybe even needs to get re branded with a more "household" nick name. And there needs to be a big push for ease of use, your average Joe is going to have to be able to make use of this tech at the push of a button, securely. IMO, that's what it's going to take. But it seems like we are headed in that direction
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:46:51
That makes no sense. BTC futures quotes on CME is being updated in real time right now, that does not always happen. There's ordinarily no way to know what the quotes are until they're released.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:17:19
Aight well I'll take your word for it and look more into it. Thanks for the advice. I'll definitely keep my eye on it so I can do a little bit of day trading.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:07:14
What does that matter in the slightest?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:59:06
I never had any USD or BTC on gdax in the first place. Haven't moved anything over from coinbase, where I've been making my btc purchases. So what it sounds like to me is, I can transfer BTC to gdax from coinbase and start buying/selling with instant transactions, right? So as soon as I have BTC available, I really wont even have to put any extra USD onto gdax.
Looks like I need to figure out this whole buy and sell order thing to really do it right, too.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:15:30
If it wouldn't be a big deal for your dad to make an account for you, it would be wise. Bitcoin might very well be a 50% higher buy in by that point. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:29:23
Your initial idea and the whole reason you entered your position is incorrect? What are you not getting about this? The whole IDEA and reason someone invested in Amazon is because they believed it would be a big money maker some day. End of story. You're actually just missing the entire concept of what we're doing. As much as you're trying, you cannot accurately predict the market. It seems like everyone ON this sub has learned the lesson that holding in makes more money in the long run that trying to predict peaks and valleys. C'mon now.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:21:57
I second this.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:46:39
I've been considering this the past couple of days. Honestly ethereum is "likely" to survive, at least to the point you want it to. 
Eth is more likely to sustain than litecoin. 
But if you're talking about long term "investment," BTC is my bet 100%. It will have the most gains long term and end up being very stable.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:41:02
Depends on your goals for that couple hundred dollars. Litecoin might (might) be quicker to triple or quadruple in price, so if it's a short term investment maybe litecoin. Honestly I'd Google predictions for the currencies and just make up your own mind.
But long term (2-3 years and longer) bitcoin is most definitely the best choice right now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:40:35
Most average plebs are buying fractions of bitcoins. You can put 50 dollars on it if you'd really like to. 
I, personally, think bitcoin is the best "long term" investment out of those. It's not only the most likely to survive but the most likely to get the most returns on your buy in (long term.)
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:27:17
I'm in your same exact shoes. From what I understand ETH is most likely to stick around. I think if you're willing to stick it out you can get a 4 times return on your initial buy in at SOME point. I'd sell at that point, but that's just me.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:42:38
Well to be honest I'm trying to learn as much as I can, through observation. I'm just having fun with it but basically I'm holding in long term no matter what.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:42:28
Okay, are buys and sells on gdax instant? I've only used coinbase so far. Let's say I transferred my btc to gdax. Would I be able to sell btc for instant USD and 30 minutes later buy back for BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:35:51
I hear you. I guess you should just know that those talking points are around everywhere. Half of what I read says to be skeptical. But anyways...with the amount of money that Americans will accumulatively have in bitcoin by the time the US tried to "ban" it, there would be a revolt over them encroaching on our rights. That's just way too far for a majority of the population. It's far more likely that the US treasury tries to move some of their assets over to bitcoin early enough for it to be a strong move for them. 
Actually that's being talked about and considered at this very moment.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:51:10
What? With the history of bitcoin what sense in the world does that make? It's dropped well over 50% in the past in one swift motion and now it's 10x the value. That will be the trend for years. It may even plummet and remain that way for a couple of months but it still has way too much energy behind it, that will be temporary. Mark my words.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:18:33
For what it's worth, it's a very real scenario that it goes up enough that a dip doesn't make it back down this low. It's also a good possibility it drops by thousands. You're not going to be able to predict it. Personally I'd get it now. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:25:05
I wouldn't sell any of it unless you need the money. It's very, very likely that it will be worth a lot more than it is now in a year's time. If you've only got half a btc or so, it's so much worth holding onto. If you had a few btc I could understand recovering your investment but at this level of "investment" you'd be doing much more harm than good by selling any of it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:55:27
Well let's see, for it NOT to hit that price point it would have to hit a brick wall and never recover. Almost no one who has any sense with this market believes that's going to happen. In fact there's starting to be predictions from some financial gurus popping up all over the place that it hits 100,000 to a million. It only makes sense with where it stands in this market for it to be around that value. But it's okay, honestly. Be skeptical. That's more tthan okay, and I've got plenty of respect for anyone's decisions. If I lose it all, honestly not concerned. That's just over half a week's paycheck for me I've invested in total now. Oh well, it was worth a shot. About the most likely lotto ticket I'll ever have a chance of winning. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:40:10
Lmao you people are out of your minds. You don't even have the SLIGHTEST concept of what's happening with bitcoin worldwide. You're clueless. 
There will definitely be a dip. Nobody's arguing that. Mark my words we end January 2018 higher than any ATH in 2017. And it will continue climbing from there, but not at this rate.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:05:39
That's fine and more power to ya for having a set mind but by the same token you aren't going to really make any substantial gains without taking some risk. Like I said, this is probably the best odds I'll ever have at any kind of lottery and I'm definitely not going broke buying the ticket.
Edit: you're not bestowing some kind of secret investing knowledge on us. Too much of what you said is just factually incorrect, anyways. It doesn't ever have to be accepted as an every day currency for us to sell at a price we're content with. Having the US ban bitcoin, that's some absurd kinda fiction playing out in your head. Honestly...just think about that one for more than a second. Jesus. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:32:41
Bought in 1,000 USD for the first time ever with bitcoin a couple days ago, got it at 9300. I was very happy with it. Been watching and watching and I felt like this might be the lowest we see it again, (as a possibility) and just bought 2,000 more in USD when it went down at like 11,035. We'll see what happens now. If it took a huge plummet I might have a bad taste in my mouth but it wouldn't really bother me. I'll probably just buy more at that point anyways. BTC is going to end up at the very least 40-60k per BTC but probably much higher. I'll be better off in the end either way.
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:48:20
Yea, well the thing about that is that bitcoin's underlying tech is already "good enough" to hang with what you call "superior digital currencies" when multi layered systems are introduced, and they have been already. There's nothing bitcoin isn't capable of in terms of meeting the needs of the masses in a worldwide currency age. When you're talking milliseconds for a transaction, do you really think a "superior digital currency" makes a difference? Especially when bitcoin is still and will be for ages to come secure to a standard that anyone invested would ever need it to be? 
Bitcoin is the face of cryptos, and cryptos are the future. Even if in 200 years bitcoin is not the dominant currency, it's going to have its time in the spotlight. If you can't recognize that, you can't recognize common human behavior.
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:41:50
Alright, point taken. So what do you mean by "doesn't exactly matter here" then?
Edit: So I just sent close to 4 grand worth of BTC to Electrum wallet and I can't identify a single cost in the matter. How can I identify what the fee might have been from the exchange to my new wallet?
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:25:04
Using Electrum to handle all transactions? What does that mean?
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:00:12
So nothing at all is taking any extra steps as far as networking goes? This is all done locally? AS FAR AS ELECTRUM IS CONCERNED. At that point it refers to the blockhain to identify value, correct?
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:58:01
And that is basically all done offline? Without having to refer to Electrum servers?
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:11:44
I'm setting up right now, I have my seed written down on paper. Is encryption with a password necessary? Does it make it difficult in any way for quick transactions? Any reason NOT to do it or any reason TO do it?
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:49:08
I'm very interested in this, this is awesome :D But the private key interacts through Electrum, does it not? Is it not showing ELECTRUM that you are the owner of the coins? Or does blockchain itself have a failsafe like that?
