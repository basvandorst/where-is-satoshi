Hey, I just saw your handle over on Localbitcoins.com. Nice to see Bitcoin represented in LR! May buy some coin from you soon.

In my experience, yes. Mostly from those that claim to be progressive. My guess is that someone in there peer group or media sphere has said something negative about bitcoin and parroting their line is easier than doing research. Once a person has committed publicly to a stance on a particular, it becomes very difficult for that person to remain objective in light of facts that contradict their preconceived notions. Political leaders, sociopaths, and witch doctors use this method to commit their followers to actions that contradict rational and moral behavior. As others have said here, the best course of action is not to proselytize. Just live your values until they catch on.

Nice! I've offered btc as a payment option at my last two comicons, but no takers thus far. I could see it becoming being wildly popular for convention attendees in the coming years. Safer than cash, more convenient than square payments.
