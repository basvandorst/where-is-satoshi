"Traditional monetary policy tools" refers to raising and lowering interest rates, and hence controlling the money supply.
You fucking twat.

If it was even regarded as plausible by the physics community they'd be funding it. It doesn't have to be proven.
The romantic image of a lone-wolf scientist making a huge breakthrough is exactly that: a romantic image. 99% of the time, the "lone genius" is a quack, and is cut off from the scientific community for a reason.
Gregory Perelman is the only counterexample I can think of, and even then he followed the most promising line of attack.

I'm not expecting an answer to that, I'm trying to drive home a point: debt is the lifeblood of business. Most posters on here only ever focus on personal finance, where debt is a very different animal.

What about people in debt? Inflation is good for them. Inflation only hurts people on fixed incomes - typically retired people.

What if I'm a business owner who needs money for stock *now* because, say, christmas is coming. Do I just save up until I have enough money, or do I take out a short-term business loan?

That's right.
Real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation.
As you said, it's rare to see a negative real interest rate. 
Nominal interest rates are always positive. That's because a lender will never pay someone to take their money. But the higher inflation is, the lower the real interest rate.
If inflation goes negative (deflation), that drives up real interest rates. Nominal interest rates will only be cut so far to compensate, because they can't go below 0.
The conclusion is that deflation hurts people in debt.
