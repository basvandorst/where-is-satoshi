These elite or whatever just made btc fall to smithereens. Necker Island and roundtables BAD IDEA for btc. You hve no idea how many young kids bought the stuff while still at school. Are you experiencing a lack of control panic attack. Look how BTC has fallen from all these blooming self-appointed necker-monarchs. Wasn't is Japanese and isn't it global. OMG your NSA must've got hold of the spreadsheets.

Yeah, it's the same mindset as people who place explosive devices and then walk away from the carnage. While people fight it out over what a journalist wrote, the journalist disappears from the outcome. Nowadays I look at what my peers have to say - in the end it's better to go and walk with the dog and look at real things just for a change.

I'm with you Mr. Voorhees - so, what might have been this journalist's motives do you think? Who pays his salary? A great case in point of their deception is the simple fact that Larry King went to RT - huh? Where he can somewhat speak his real mind? Else why? You were strung up by this person. Anybody still read what these people write at all? I reckon their audience is fast dwindling. Oh and btw Mr. Voorhees, why do so many chartered accountants' companies offer their services to handle your bitcoin portfolio's. I'm a bit flummoxed by this - and as someone only looking in still, plse could you tell me exactly where accountants fit into the whole "my btc investment" thing? Cheers and strength to you.
