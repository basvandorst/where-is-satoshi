I definitively would, and I honestly dont see why not. They've been great for years with my accounts. Crypto is brutally unforgiving with small mistakes when it comes to security, but theres nothing in my experience with Bitfinex that suggests to me I shouldnt continue to use them once they patch up the issue and go back online.

Sure, Bitfinex are responsible of making their customers whole. I'm not sure if you have a proper argument here though. They should also not use the money that wasn't stolen from some customers and give it to other customers. Money not stolen ought to be accessible to its original owners, while the exchange should also seek to pay the customers whose funds were stolen; its not so complex really.

Yeah, that still doesnt make the "in the US" argument any better. They are still not in the US. And theres a good argument against socialising the losses. They have acknowleged that only some btc was stolen while other currencies are intact; so if they didnt steal someone's dollars its absurd that they don't give the unstolen money to its owner. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:18:46
Its been two and a half years since MTGox got hacked and no one has seen a penny, except for lawyers. Do you want that? Or do you prefer to receive a part of what was lost right now while they gradually repay the rest month by month?
You are right though in that it boils down to whether they go bankrupt or not. In the first case everything is liquidated and we wait for five years to receive the crumbles that remain after the lawyers take our money. In the second case Finex continues operating and deals with its creditors according to their specific situations, which is what any normal company does day by day. No bankruptcy is pragmatically a million times better, for everyone, regardless of how outraged we might feel.
@_date: 2016-08-10 22:40:07
No one is forced to sell their tokens. The only price at which Bitfinex can buy them is $1, they can't participate in the market.

@_date: 2016-08-05 15:09:13
You arguments betray your ignorance about this topic. "A court" as you say it will not get involved unless Bitfinex declares itself insolvent. But if they come up with a roadmap to paying their debts, which is what they are doing, they will not go into bankruptcy and therefore they will continue to oprate and eventually pay everyone.
Also, what seems so evident to you is absolutely not the case; what would really put Bitfinex in a legally unsustainable situation is if they broke into accounts that were not affected. They just dont have that right, which is why they are putting each case into different categories to deal with them in the correct way. Affected accounts were unlucky, that is correct, and those users will need to be more patient.
As to point 2- Baseless? Do i need to point out again how the socialised losses model form Gox only leads to not being able to see a penny for years, and to multimillion dollar legal fees that only decimate the pot further? The Gox experience is not clear enough, or bad enough? Also, there were accounts with several million dollars in fiat. do you think that those account holders will just sit there while Bitfinex uses their money to pay for their own mistakes? Socialised USD losses would lead faster to lawsuits, and moreover to lawsuits that they cant possibly win, because they have no right to take money that was not stolen from one user, to pay for the losses that came from their mistakes. If Bitfinex is a responsible company, they will pay with their own money, not with their customers money. Doing so would lead them to jail. They can't socialise USD losses because thats the worse possible action from a legal standpoint.
But you obviously have no idea or experince with any of this, nor the disposition to understand something beyond what you've already made up your mind about, so I will not reply any further.

60 milion is not as big as it seems for a financial company. People are underestimating the value of a company like Bitfinex. The largest Bitcoin exchange is worth a lot more than 60 mil, and no, it's not easy to replicate just by hiring developers and marketing; just ask the Winkie twins if attracting Bitfinex's liquidity is that easy.
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:45:33
Yes there was. Are you seriously not aware that there are at least 200k Bitcoins waiting to be distributed through Kraken? Bankruptcy proceedings take years and they are costly, thats my point. I'm honestly struggling here trying to figure out how the specific characteristics of the Gox case that you are mentioning have anything to do with this point.
@_date: 2016-08-05 03:36:11
What if they come up with a model to gradually make affected users whole? Most likely their repayment model, while not ideal, will be better anyway than a multi-year-long and expensive legal conflict.

You are right, but I think OP suggests a very viable short-term fee vacation to encourage people to stay and even to try to increase their userbase. In any case, fee promotion or not, that's not the crux of OP's approach, the main point is that they should communicate their intentions to pay, and a roadmap for it, rather than in terms of haircuts.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:30:54
If a bank gets robbed, it is their responsibility to pay to all of their customers, but they cant use othe customer's money to pay for this robbery. This is the whole point. Bitfinex must (and it seems that is what they are trying to do) pay everyone with Bitfinex money, not customers money. To achieve this, Bitfinex must survive and pay affected customers with money they could raise form different sources like operational revenue, external investors or loans. 60 million in the finantial sector is really not as big as it seems, and i'm sure they will come up with a plan where everyone gets paid -but to do this they must remain operational, and hence they must respect the balances of unaffected accounts.
They are not going to say "fuck yourselves" to anyone, but affected accounts will have to wait a bit longer. It's not black or white; its not like some users get all and some get nothing; affected accounts will receive a % initially in any case, and then they will receive a gradual payment. Socialising losses implies bankruptcy and really is horrible for everyone because it results automaticallly in no one receiving nothing at all for years.
This is how both scenarios would play out in practice. And the best one for everyone involved is the one where Bitfinex survives to pay back everyone direclty, instead of  bankruptcy court. Man, I had 600 bitcoins in MtGox and they are doing the sociallised loss thing and its totally useless: nothing, zero in years. Wouldnt you prefer to get at least 30% now and be able to trade during the next bitcoin bubbles? With the socialised loss bankruptcy you are out of the game indefinitively and theres nothing you can do to make things go faster.
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:27:05
I'd say the chances are very high. Trading companies are among the most profitable in the world because their revenues are very high while operation costs are relatively very low. Moreover, 60 million dollars is really not a big deal in the context of finetch or stratups in general, especially one that can show potential investors years of consistenly increasing profits. If Bitcoin is going to be such a big deal in the long run, I would say that the potential value of of Bitfinex is in the hundreds of millions of dollars at least. So finding VC to buy Bitfinex shares at this point is totally doable. If I were a VC guy I'd be be on the phone with the CEO discussing investment terms. Look at Gatecoin. They got hacked like two months ago for 2 million worth of eth, and they are back up and running again already. And Bitfinex is easily 30 times bigger than Gatecoin. Finally, let's not forget that they do have money to begin with, so while the hack was 60 mil, that's not really even close to their actual deficit, so they will probably not need to raise 60, but maybe 20 or 30 mil.
So, I definitively won't just assume insolvency as a starting point. The best result for eveyone is if they survive and pay everyone with their money + money they raise by selling shares to VC. Very doable imho.
EDIT: so, yeah, ultimately the point is that it can operate as a company with some debt, and avoid becoming an insolvent company.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:17:24
I hope my reply will help you understand how this is different. Precisely what i'm trying to get across is the following:
1- That this is different to Gox precisely because in this case it is possible to tell which wallets were affected. It is known whose coins were stolen and which coins were not. Because this is known, it is not legally feasible to just dip into a user's uncompromised account. Simply put the segregated accounts structure means those funds are not public. This makes all the difference in the world, and thus differentiates the situation from Gox's. The locker room analogy is intended precisely to explain this. 
Also, the fungibility objection is irrelevant because the lockers can be filled with currency without affecting the crux of the analogy, which is the segregation of deposits. The whole point is that you understand this concepts about the implications of knowing which accounts were affected and which not. The main implication being that, like in a locker room, contents are segregated and not fungible.
Note: the only way private accounts could become 'public' and fungible is if Bitfinex went into a bankruptcy procedure, then all assets would be liquidated into a single pot. But believe me, even without socialising losses across all assets and all lockers (i.e. socialising BTC losses only), everyone will be better off faster than if there is a bankruptcy.  
2- In their push for socialising losses across all accounts, affectes users are really shooting themselves in the foot because in that scenario Bitfinex closes and all funds are locked up for years. While in the siloing proposal everyone will see at least a significant chunk repaid right away, with more coming gradually. The reason is that socialising all losses would imply the end of Bitfinex and their terminal inability to ever repay in full.
Finally, I would like to note how ironic is the speed at which Anarchocapitalists become socialists when it is their money what is on the line.
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:04:36
Ultimately it boils down to whether Bitfinex is bankrupt or not.
If it is bankrupt, then they will have to go through the process like MtGox
If they find a way to save the exchange (which i think is more than feasible), then they should treat the losses on a case-by-case basis. Why would someone who was there just as a lender, or someone who whas only trading eth for usd, be affected? Why should someone's ether be sold to buy someone else a btc? It's absurd, especially in light of their segregated wallets structure: they know which coins were stolen and which were not. They know which coins belong to whom, and that makes a world of difference.
You can expect big holders who are able to verify that their, say, 10,000 coins are still in their Bitgo address untouched to leverage legal resources to prevent teir coins to be touched. And with good reason.
All this goes to the trash if they declare bankruptcy. But i think it is more likely they will resume operations and make up some sort of plan to make those users who had their wallets drained whole, while respecting the funds of people who were not affected.

Put an audio recorder in a public park. The sounds of everyone passing by, from their footsteps to their chatter gets recorded. The wind and the birds and the honks of the cars nearby and the icecream truck music, it all gets recorded. Because its in a public park, anyone can even come close to the mic and tell a joke, confess a crime or even advertise. Anything goes. From the wind to the criminal, none of these actors needed permission to end up in the final recording. And yet, when you pick up the recorder and take it back home, no matter how many times you play it, you will hear the same sounds in the same unique and immutable sequence.
So, yeah, permissionlessness and immutability are not mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2016-08-05 03:14:45
Because they know which assets in which accounts specifically were affected. 
There is even less legal ground for them to use other people's funds to pay for the robbery. 
Of course they have to repay those users who were affected, but that doesn't mean that they can just go into other people's accounts and say "oh look at this, there's some money here i'll just take it!". 
You are probably biased by your particular position in all this, but try to be objective and you'll see that there is just no legal ground for such a thing. Affected users will have to have more patience, because they really have no legal or moral claim over the money of other users whose funds were not stolen. I think Bitfinex will not go bankrupt, and over time everyone will be repaid. As long as they are not bankrupt, they should handle their debts on a one-by-one basis as is the case in any operating companies.
And i think we can all agree that the best -and fastest- results for everyone involved, including for Bitcoin itself is for Bitfinex not to go bankrupt.

If you edit the original tape that's equivalent to a fork. And, is it really necessary to use that condescending tone?


You made a universal claim about the abstract concepts "Permissionlessness" and "immutability", so I am showing that the rule you are suggesting is not correct. To show this the audio analogy is not central though, because reality itself is both permissionless and immutable. The analogy works just as fine, if not better, with video: set a camera in a public space and you will get a unique sequence of images every time you try it. Or go out on the street with google glass and youll end up with a video full of objects, sounds and people who didnt ask your permission to be on the frame.
Or take the moon or the earth whose specific geographic configurations are the result of countlesss of actors from within and from without transacting with its phisicality in different ways (meteors, plaques, weather volcanoes and so on.
And i'm sticking to crypto because thats what the blockchain is in its current state (at any time) a recording of the aggregated actions of diverse actors upon it.
But i'm really not planning on going further than this (which should be enough) in this conversation because as a friend of mine says, If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry.

You're reading too much into my comment. All I am saying is that the one true reason for people to buy bitcoins is because they are supposed to become more expensive over time. I have no idea about when or by what percentage. If/when the price starts going up again consistently, then regular people will start to buy them again. Maybe nowish or maybe in 2020, I don't know. Still, who knows, maybe by the next halving, it will already be a long-forgoten fad from the stupid past.

I am not saying that the halving causes the bubble. What I am saying is that the halving is not factored in the price yet, and that it has a positive impact in the price (all else being equal) over time, as the market adapts to lower supply. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 04:35:06
To be fair, a few years ago it was just as 'true' that it was impossible to have digital 'objects' that could be transferred but not duplicated. Then Satoshi came along with a brilliant solution and suddenly it was possible. Who knows, maybe someone will come up with a way to have a secure blockchain, and that somehow does not need a currency token as incentive for miners. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:19:43
Bluntly put, the only real reason for people to buy bitcoins, the crucial  'feature', is that the price goes up (in theory). If the price ever starts going up again, people will start to buy them, forming a new bubble. Honestly, no one even here would buy bitcoins unless we were not expecting to get the benefit of becoming richer. Hell, even Satoshi has made the argument that the reason buy BTC is because it is like a lottery ticket. Of course, when everyone has their lottery ticket, there's no more lottery prize to win, but it doesn't matter because then you've got a bootstrapped currency.

Moreover, while IANAL, I am pretty sure that anyone profiting from sharing copyrighted material, even if it is a quarter of a penny, would be in way deeper legal shit than if there's no $ involved at all.
Don't get me wrong, I think that 'copyright' should mean "the right to copy", but the way things are in practice, sadly I would advice against accepting BTC for seeding. For seeding copyrighted material, that is, since there are indeed many lawful use cases for this. It could get kids in trouble.
@_date: 2015-06-27 08:36:50
They said exactly the same before the last halving and look what happened. 
In one sense you are right though, all halvings -not just the upcoming one- are having an effect in making the price what it is. If I didn't know the supply was decreasing as it is designed to do, I wouldn't have bought coins ever. But on the other hand, cost of mining means miners have to sell most of new coins as soon as they get them. So imagine them having less coins to sell, and it being a permanent decrease in the suppy in new coins?

Yes well, that is the crux of the debate. I think that many could agree that trust is not weakened by this. No new coins are created, just a transaction that restores a known lost wallet for the benefit of the community. Bitcoin is community. It can be done without compromising trust, in my opinion and (obviously) in the opinion of all other proponents. Maybe there can be a protocol based-solution to make this a one-time event? If developers come up with a solution to guarantee that it is a one-time event, would you support the idea then? 
Anyway, it is only in a one in a billion eventuality like this one that the community can possibly agree to such a thing. If such an agreement would take place it would be collective, very reluctantly accomplished, if ever, in consideration of this unique set of circumstances.
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:59:54
No, you greedy and small-minded fool, way more important than the increased scarcity is the decreased creative and etreprenurial power that was amputated from Bitcoin as a community. 
I had projects that now will not take place, projects that would have added vaue to everyone else's Bitcoins, in a much more significant way that just making them a bit more scarce. Many people with passion and dreams have been shut down, denied, disempowered. 
The goxxing of the goxxed is a huge hit to the fundamentals of Bitcoin because empowered passionate people is what has made Bitcoin grow like it has. 
People who salivate over the increased scarcity strike me as not only disgustingly greedy and selfish, but especially as stupid and una ble to see beyond their nose.

But it is not so fair if you arbitrarity pick the timeframe that suits your point. What if your timeframe to see if the halving was priced in or not was 6 months or a year?
Edit: Specially, I might add, due to the nature of this event. It is a very drastic change to the most prominent variable in the market: Supply! Reduced by 50% all of a sudden!, and moreover, permanently! I see it like a total shock, a collision against a brick wall. Maybe a second before the collision you make some movents, try to cover your face or something sudden. That's the 'pricing in'. But after it you are stunned for a while, maybe have broken bones or something and need to start changing lots of things to adapt to what just happened. Not the best analogy haha, but you get the point: the market is changed by it and the effects of it emerge over time. Not only in terms of price but also in terms of mining technology and investment, network centralisation, etc.

So, basically, what you are saying is that, even if it is properly and immaculately run, the new Gox would have zero chances of success?    
If that is what you are saying, then my reply is that while maybe you are right we can not possibly be sure of that, and that giving it a chance is a minor risk worth taking. Maybe, it will be well run, and manage to rehabilitate its image over time. It has a fair chance to do so, since a lot of people would have to trade there for some time, since the coins a re there already. Also, Having so many sock holders might be like having a huge PR army, and a huge army of auditors with teeth, so that they (we) would defend the new Gox when things are done well, and force change when they are not.     
It is totally worth a shot.

@_date: 2014-09-28 18:04:09
They have been working hard these few months to cripple the price as bad as possible, so that they can not just buy a few coins, but get in a dominant position. Once they are locked in, up it goes again. You people are letting those who set the price do the thinking for you. Bitcoin adoption and development has boomed this year like never before. I've seen it before: price goes down with no reason, in the midst of spectacular news, finds a bottom, and when it goes up again the same people who were saying "no one is adopting it, its stagnant and ridiculous" are the ones screaming "to the moon!"
The truth is: as long as development and etrepreneurship goes on (and boy it has in 2014) the price will eventually always catch up. Just be patient.
EDIT: Well, not ONLY be patient. DO SOMETHING! Write about it, come up with a business idea, attend local meetups or organise them, donate, encourage local merchants to adopt. If you own a Bitcoin, you are not only a stockk holder, you ARE the company, you are Bitcoin. Bitcoin is us, the protocol is nothing without us, it is whatever we make with it. So, if you want Bitcoin to grow, go out and make it happen, damnit! Waht are you waiting for, as Gavin said, for permission?

I think this is a huge assumption, since everyone will know that the new Gox will be nothing like the old one. No one is proposing to make an exchange managed by Karpeles, coded in PHP, that never communicates, and that refuses to prove solvency. The only thing in common with the old Gox would be the name, and its LIQUIDITY, which is the most important feature of an exchange (once trustability is good). The new Gox would be very liquid since it inherits a huge customer base. If the new (and de-karpelificated) Gox is set up so that real-time solvency is provable, enables m-of-n wallets, etc. Then you have a pretty good value proposition again.

You see, that is the point I am trying to make: no one should be asked to choose, and this might even work. Without interfering with the debt relation MtGox has to its customers, Goxcoin could still exist merely being a mirage of the state of affairs at the moment of MtGox's closure. Scarcity alone would be its claim to value (like Bitcoin itself and all other altcoins, by the way), not MtGox's ability to repay Bitcoins. Maybe community donations too, as you suggested, but I agree that there are other causes that are way more deserving of donations, so I wouldn't expect too much on that front either.
So to summarise my views:
1- Gox's debt is very devalued at this point, so Goxcoins would be able to claim little value from that. If it is tied to Gox payments, i.e. Goxcoins = MtGox IOUs, the chances of Goxcoins going to $0 are significant.
2- Community donations are as unlikely to match the ammount of wealth MtGox debtors are rightfully owed.
3- Some value could emerge by virtue of scarcity of Goxcoins, and only by that scarcity alone. Doing it in that way would actually shield the new currency from any and all future incoming MtGox-originated disappointments.
4- In the case MtGox somehow starts honoring their debts, then the debtors would still receive them, regardless of the existence, failure, or success of Goxcoins.

I disagree, because this would not be or become an institution, more like an one-time extraordinary mission.

I profoundly disagree. There can be an "Exodus Block", just as there was a "Genesis Block". This is an extraordinary event and as humans we have the ability to deal with extraordianry events. We must not lose this ever.
Assuming this is the truth, that the private key to gox's big vault is lost, and that there was no massive hack, it follows that it is possible for the network to allow its recovery as a matter of communitarian interest.
After all, the network is designed to do what the community agrees it should do.
To the point: An extraordinary transaction to an address under the control of a multistakeholder entity, composed by impartial and trusted actors could be allowed through the consensus of miners and developers.
This entity could use mtgox's records to return the coins to all verified gox customers, in a process that could be designed to be as transparent as possible.
Something along this lines is worth discussing with the Foundation, all visible members of the community, and the community itself.
Leaving thousands of people in the cold, on their own, thousands of supporters with projects and the will to work to realise the potential of Bitcoin, in the name of the dogma of irreversibility, would be silly and borderline inhuman.
Bitcoin is what we as a community make it, and given the extraordinary circumstances, bringing those coins back to life through our consensus is the only reasonable thing to do.
There would be a lot of details to discuss, technically, socially, and in terms of the actual logistics of such a process. But because it is not impossible we, as a community, can make it work.
@_date: 2014-05-01 03:58:20
You will do way better if you spend the money buying bitcoins right now, instead of the expensive machine. Unless you are very technically savvy, buying bitcoins beats mining them in any scenario. Personally I think the price right now is a ridiculously cheap bargain, I would buy now before it's too late. I give this advice only because you are asking for advice.

Why is it that if you want to use the BIP0038 option in bitaddress, you are no longer asked for any kind of entropy-generating input, like with brain and normal wallets?
Does the way BIP0038 works means private keys are safe from attacks based on low entropy weaknesses?
If BIP0038 is a way to encrypt the private key, does that mean that the actual private key is just underneath the cloaking generated by BIP0038, and that the wallet could in theory be sweeped by an attacker looking for collisions based on flawed/predictable random number generation?
Or, is this altogether non-feasible due to the way BIP0038 works?

Agreed, if hackers have the coins then it doesn't work, but what if Karpeles were to say -and prove- he lost the keys? In that case it could be done, just mine an 'Exodus Block' in the fork, with a transaction transferring the trapped coins to the trusted commission of notables.

390 here, not selling because it can shoot up at any minute. The market is fundamentally broken at this point so there are no rational approches to shorting.

The 10% is for any ADDITIONAL funds they manage to recover, whether they do blockchain forensics, or they sue Karpeles out of extra cash.    
As someone who had coins in gox, I think that whoever manages to recover any additional funds more than deserves to be paid those 10%. It is actually a GOOD thing that that is included in the plan, since it will provide a juicy incetive for such recovery.    
From my point of view, the more I learn about this plan the more I think this is actually a FANTASTIC thing, and I hope it succeeds.

Why, it is grand that we are already thinking about the logistics, I say!
I think they can be solved. Again, IF the coins are not spent. Gox would most likely be cooperative, since its in their interest apparently. But still, the nice Russian hackers who stole their databases have already made that a non-issue. Everyone who got goxxed is on a list that is exact to the satoshi. Most likely, there are ways to verify balance/identity matches without requiring Gox intervention. Perhaps a commision of notable and trusted members of the community could be appointed to oversee the process, anything is possible. We think we can defeat the banks, change the world, this is peanuts man.

In general i am very open minded and ready to consider creative ways out of this catastrophe, but no matter how you try to spin it or polish it, essentially this proposal can be reduced to this: 
So: Sorry, but NO.
Edit: If this were to be setup IN ADDITION and INDEPENDENTLY to any and all future agreements to MtGox, then yes by all means, why not. But something like this should not, in any way, replace or lead to the cessation of MtGoxs pending obligations to their customers. However, if that would be the case, these Goxcoins would not be backed by Gox itself or its potential debt repayment, making it independent from Bitcoin Builder, but by the eventual and yet-to-be-seen generosity of future pre-mined altcoin promoters. Skepticism on this being of any substance: to the roof.

The only way this would be acceptable from the point of view of MtGox debtors is if it is not backed by any potential MtGox payments to its original debtors. I mean, if MtGox somehow recuperates the coins, the they would still repay to us, not to whoever we traded GoxCoins to. So, completely detached from MtGox, unlike Bitcoin Builder. What would back Goxcoins then? Its scarcity: if they are distributed 1:1 to people verifiably holding Bitcoins at MtGox, then that means there would be about 750.000 Goxcoins in existence, and never more. They would be quite scarce, and therefore could in theory gain value over time. Maaaaybe.

Leaving thousands of people in the cold, on their own, thousands of supporters with projects and the will to work to realise the potential of Bitcoin, in the name of the dogma of irreversibility, would be silly and borderline inhuman.
Bitcoin is what we as a community make it, and given the extraordinary circumstances, bringing those coins back to life through our consensus is the only reasonable thing to do.
There would be a lot of details to discuss, technically, socially, and in terms of the actual logistics of such a process. But because it is not impossible we, as a community, can make it work.

Not a bad thing in itself, but it raises a flag. There have been many post like yours recently. So, either you are a real new Bitcoin user and new to Reddit, which is perfectly possible, and in which care you are most welcome here, OR you are part of a campaign to manipulate the market, which has been known to happen and is also perfectly possible.
Users with older accounts are significantly less likely to be part of a manipulative effort, than users with a new account.
So, it would help if you could prove somehow that you and your story are real.

There are scanners that save directly to an SD card. The digital copy is also 'cold' in this case. You can then insert the card into the Selphy and print 100% safely. Having a digital 'cold' copy is a bit of extra redundancy, so adds more protection from the paper being destroyed or lost somehow.

That is not what you were initially arguing, you said that no society had 'prospered' without government or banking. People have prospered.   
Still, your new line of argumentation is wrong too. Do you think the Mayans or Egyptians did not have 'high' economic levels? If so, you are wrong again.   
I would argue that on the contrary, the wealth in Western society comes from ruthlessnes: global colonisation and systematic exploitation of peoples around the world. Government and banking are as much a tool for 'industry' and 'development' as they are to make invasions seem fair game. But that is a different debate.

The IOU, I already have: it is MtGox being in the process of coming up with a debt repayment strategy, under the supervision of Japanese authorities. Quite thin, I know. Giving me the ability to trade on that debt, which is unlikely to be ever met, is of little value. Bitcoin Builder values that payment potential at 7% currently, i.e., a penny on the dollar. What I think is that any eventual Goxcoin would only make sense if it is an experiment based merely on its relative scarcity, but not tied to Gox's obligations at all.

Yes, that is why i wrote "most humans", a few are still on fiat, but the bots dwarf their demand. This is just a theory though. To me it makes sense to buy these ultra cheap coins, as the chances of getting fiat if they are insolvent are not significantly higher than getting btc, it could take years, etc. On the other hand if they are solvent, Btc prices will most likely soar once withdrawals are back, and it will be the fastest way to get out of Gox anyway.

If the new fork has no **miners**, its value drops to 0.
Its a big difference, because the barriers of entry to mining are beyond the reach of 99.99% of the population. You need serious capital, highly specific know-how, to be in a jusrisdiction that allows mining, and where electricty is very cheap, and on top of that it is an extremely risky (financially) activity. Whoever says 'all you need to have a vote in the bitcoin republic is to be a human', is either naive or disingenuous.

I can't believe no one has said the actual reason:
Your chart shows the volume at one of the exchanges, but over the last months many exchanges have opened and managed to get decent chunks of the volume pie. For instance Bitfinex, ANX, OKCoin, etc. Hence the volume is much lower in the particular exchange you are looking at, but the volume of the aggregated ecosystem has not decreased so much.
@_date: 2015-01-25 05:32:37
I am doing a PhD in this stuff. Bitcoins are indeed debt-free money in the sense that unlike fiat currencies, they are not created though the process of creating new debt. Mining is essentially a service to the community/network, which is paid for in new bitcoins. Debt is not involved in the process of creation of new bitcoins. A bitcoin does not represent what is owed, but what is owned. Another way to see it is that while fiat money represents the future (you will work to pay your debt), bitcoins represent the past (have you added value to the btc network?).

I always say this. It's year 2557 over here already.
@_date: 2015-05-04 09:55:51
The question then is which one of the following is the true statement:
-The coin with more miners will attract more users because it is the safest one.
-The coin with more users will attract more miners because it is the most profitable one.
I would argue that it is the first one, although admittedly there is a lot of a feedback loop dynamic going on. Why would I argue for the first one to predominate? Because safety of the network is thecore fundamental thing that gives value to the coin in the first place. It agglutinates people and gains value because the people perceive and agree that it is safe, and that because it is safe it is valuable. This is why I think the power in Bitcoin is ultimately held by the miners, if the main miners refuse to fork... Bitcoin just doesn't fork, simple as that. 
The 'public' and 'humans', on the other hand, are in a position of a lot less influence. If the fork is desireable for the interests of powerful miners (or for the powers they might serve), it will be executed, and maybe some well-informed individuals might protest and exit Bitcoin. But that would be it; dissent, even if it is the dissent of many, would not have much of an impact, overall, in the path Bitcoin takes.
I guess what I am trying to say is that Bitcoin is not really as decentralised as it seems to be. Miners are power nodes many orders of magnitude bigger than any non-miner individual. Blame it on the PoW algorithm, and its experimental nature, which -because it needed to keep it simple in the early days- led to the philosophical hack that are ASICS. 
A simple way to defend the network from ASIC centralisation is to have a PoW algorithm that mutates periodically, thus eliminating the posibility of creating a chip dedicated to a single function to mine the coin, which is what an ASIC is. If THAT was in the upcoming fork, we would suddenly have a rennaisance in small scale Bitcoin mining. Overnight, it would be again possible to mine at home, and we would have a million -ten million- new miners using just their regular PCs. It would be a much more democratic network, it would actually have the chance to be of benefit for non-industrialised countries, it would be safer, and it would actually be a P2P network -as it is supposed to be.  
But, that is not going to happen. That is NEVER going to happen. Why? Because ASIC-based industrial mining is not only a way to raise the barrier of entry (thus lowering competition and maximising profit), but more importantly, it is the way to materially control the ability of Bitcoin to change, and they certainly don't want THAT change. So, yeah, big miners are in control basically - and all those proclaiming now it will give power back to the people, are going to re-read their comments in a few years and realise how naive and embarrasing they are.

Maybe, but I tink we all agree in that the term "money laundering" is normally associated with an illegal and shady origin of the funds in the first place. Casting this situation as a 'money laundering' attempt from OKCoin is not exaclty fair either because the economic activity causing the funds is nothing illegal, just some web development job. The term makes the whole thing seem evil, and, even worse, kind of exploits the 'drug money' perception baggage that Bitcoin carries. I'm not saying OKCoin are right in this one, but it seems to me that Ver is perfectly ok with throwing Bitcoin under the bus to get his profit. Which is fine I guess, but  he was supposed to be 'BTC Jesus', and this also shows he ultimately doesnt really care too much.
@_date: 2015-05-24 11:06:56
Right. For the record, I will be more than willing to admit I am wrong in this opinion IF you tell me that it is them, and not your side, who are going for the "money laundering" narrative.
My point is that if you are legitimately on the side Bitcoin advocates are, you would be very reluctant to further associate Bitcoin, and one of its most prominent exchanges, with "money laundering" acusations. Even if it is technically  correct. These kind of mental connections harm Bitcoin, are tabloidish, alarmist, and harm Bitcoin and its community. Why feed these terms to the press? Are you really on Bitcoin's side?
I'm not saying that you shouldn't litigate to get the payments they agreed upon. But "money laundering"? Seriously, coming from you it makes me feel a disappointment similar than when Karpeles crapped on all of us because of "transaction malleabillity". I don't mean to antagonise with this, just trying to get my point across.

And yet somehow the price has come down, not up. I mean, the trend can change and as I said it looks like it might be changing now. But the 'its more valuable now than in 2012' argument hasn't been exactly working either. People who have been buying based on the good news have been losing a lot of money for a year. Also, what do you mean by 'wash'? Personally I think the number one reason is traders -they are not interested in adding value to BTC, exclusively in subtracting.

There's also a lot more coins than then, and (more significantly IMHO) it is now extremely expensive to mine. While in 2012 miners could keep most of their mine coins for the future, now they must sell most of the mined coins to be able to pay the bills. Plus there's futures markets, leveraged margin trading paying exhorbitant interest, auctions, who knows how many 100Ks of stolen gox coins yet to be sold, bitpay selling pressure, and why go on. Actually, its amazing to me we're still above 200 per coin which is more than minimum wage in half of the world. More amazingly even, the charts are currently suggesting that a double bottom MIGHT be forming. If so, we MIGHT see prices significantly higher before halloween.

Because we are not idiots who are unable to debate the merits of information as it comes forth?
Reddit is a platform for debate. It allows for thorough arguing of topics. The voting system exist for a reason, here we don't need a nanny to guard us from the baddies. If and when there are lies, scams, etc. they get immediately called out. That is how it works, not by having someone filtering what 'the masses' can and can not see.
Besides this is a disingenuous argument, as you probably know, because what was being removed was not fraudulent content, but all alternative implementations, everything that was not Core, even though they were relevant parts of the conversation that needed to be discussed.
EDIT. And I will add, to answer to your comments more directly: Of course it is relevant to the community what Mike Hearn has to say. He was a Bitcoin dev for a long time, he had close contact with Satoshi, and he was a prominent member of the community with connections in high places of Silicon Valley. 
You might violently disagree with what he had to say, that is fine, but he was relevant to the conversation. If you disagree with him, debate him and let me hear your arguments so that I can figure out what I think about it myself.

Moderation of hateful posts, low quality debate, personal attacks, etc. is great. Insulting the intelligence of the Bitcoin community by unilaterally deciding to call 'altcoins' alternative implementations by long-time Bitcoin devs like Gavin, Hearn and others, implementations that needed to be considered and discussed in the most possible open manner? Censorship and a sorry abuse power. 
Hopefully this will be put behind, and a first step would be to -at least- admit that what transpires here is censorship, that there is no other word to describe it, and that it should end for the good of the community and for the good of Bitcoin itself.

A potential fork event can be life-changing for some of us who have committed large portions of our economic value.

If Satoshi (or whoever has gained control of the coins) moves them, it would mean that the market suddenly has millions of coins MORE that can potentially be sold any given minute. If Satoshi's coins moved, I would immediately sell my stash and ask questions after. Since many traders are likely to react similarly, the effect on the market would be severe (an order of magnitude greater than the reaction to Hearn's little paper).

Right now. In this exact moment Zuckerber, Bezos, Peter fucking Thiel, and all the other owners of big tech companies are twisting their fists in all our asses, whether we want it or not, whether we know it or not, selling our data (data about ouselves that we can't even know what it is) to the biggest and the lowest bidder alike, disregardless of whether in the process democracy goes to hell worldwide and the most vulnerable end up paying the worst price as usual.
I have been a bitcoiner for ten fucking years, but fuck way too many people in this community are so fucking naive it hurts.
Just so that you guys quit being delusional: what really goes on, the way it really works, is that every single bitcoiner that breaks over a couple million in net worth ends up setting up bank accounts and/or offshore shell companies to hold their wealth and pay their fucking taxes. The bitcoin "utopia" where the state is somehow rendered obsolete is fucking laughable. Global mainstream adoption of Bitcoin is possible, if not likely, but what that means is that it ends up being integrated, assimilated, embraced, by the current system. For example: banks will/could help you hold your crypto, manage your portfolio and (yes, morons), pay your fucking taxes in an easier way via a smart contract of your choice. With governmental audit of said smart contract of-fucking-course. States could improve their autonomy by moving towards Btc as the global reserve currency over the dollar, but only after banks themselves have already moved to it as the inter-bank global settlement currency. Etc.
"Its the state vs. us" my ass lol. We are the state. Vote for good people and the state will be good for you. Be it, participate. Or, vote for authoritarian billionaires that promise you 'freedom though low taxes' and they will rape your asses as hard as they can with 'the state' to make more money.

@_date: 2012-05-25 02:33:56
I talk about this in an article to be published very soon but what the hell, you read it first here:
Bitcoin, I think, is revolutionary especially because it distributes the creation of money. The current system, based on national and personal debt, insidiously concedes obscene yet hard to object power to rich nations and global banks. Debt-based money not only deforms the nature of human sociality and provides exorbitant privileges to powerful nations; it is also threatening collapse in Europe and the US under its own absurdity. 
The disastrous social consequences of placing debt at the root of the creation of money cannot be understated. A society whose currency is backed by debt (a.k.a. the modern world) is a society where freedom is just a word because the reality of everyday life, even for the middle classes of so-called rich countries, tends towards sublimated forms of slavery or debt peonage. An economy built on debt-based currency can only ‘grow’, the 2008 economic collapse showed us, by putting more people deeper into debt. Inevitably, this leads to a society where the many always owe more and more to the few eventually making democracy a farce. Bankers, as Robert Fisk  puts it, are the dictators of the West. 
Anthropologist David Graeber, one of the most prominent scholars in the Occupy Wall Street movement, articulates how debt embeds our culture and our very selves into an inhuman, unsustainable, condition of iniquity:
“…by turning human sociality itself into debts, they transform the very foundations of our being since what else are we, ultimately, except the sum of the relations we have with  others into matters of fault, sin, and crime, and making the world into a place of iniquity that can only be overcome by completing some great cosmic transaction that will  annihilate everything.” 
The whole world’s ‘formal’ economy is backed by debt, and debt is backed by violence. This can be verified by defaulting, and subsequently resisting eviction: state force will be used sooner rather than later. The P2P money creation system that Bitcoin proposes is truly something else as it deflates the dark power of debt-based money in society; it allows envisioning a world where the wheels of debt are no longer at the origin of economic activity. This does not mean that Bitcoin is necessarily the final and perfect answer to our needs, but it is an important step in demonstrating that it CAN be done.

Yes, the limited edition WIKISPEED SGT01 is the available model at this point.

However, the C3 is not for sale yet. Of course, it will also be possible to buy one with Bitcoins when it is released.

Fucking Economist. M-pesa is getting rich out of people who need to skip a meal to pay them, and the Economist blames the government.

I am taking this question because I am the WIKISPEED team member in charge of making Bitcoin integration happen.
The answer to your question is: Yes. There are all sorts of issues concerning Bitcoin sales. Help from the Bitcoin community can be crucial in achieving optimal results in terms of safety, ease of use for the customer, etc. What makes sense the most? What best practices should we follow? How can we make this a flawless experience?

This is valid, intelligent and articulated thought, from the left.

Speed is not so important. I am trying to get a company to accept BTC and the question at this point is how to get USD they need for operation costs even though they get paid in BTC.

But, not necessarily: that is one of the challenges of the Btc developers community. Solutions for this WILL be found. A good step in that direction is zipconf.com, for example. A dedicated POS system + zipconf and now we really are one step closer to usable, instant bitcoins-as-cash. It is more important to ask why not (as OP did) than to 'know' why not.

How on earth can you claim to be "helping to change the conditions" of injustice by TAKING over foreign land? 
If you were remotely interested in changing the dynamics that put some people at a disadvantage, you would not consider taking the only real asset they have. Again you are resorting to catchwords: "21st century", "globalisation",  "to be a part of the world", "High Tech Free Trade City", "free movement" (free? yeah, for you! Go try to get a US or European visa as Vanuatuan...) Everything about your arguments works in one way only, because when you say "its time to forget the past" you mean "give us more land", not "its time to return the land".
I am not angry about the past. I am angry about the present, which is fucking unfair and tilted towards Rich White Men (now you might be thinking "I am not rich" but please... you are in the island market), and the reasons for this are historic. Understanding history is discouraged because it necessarily results in resistance. Countries that understand history limit colonialist practices like foreign land purchase and foreign natural resource exploitation.
Here is a dare to make you understand what you are unable to understand: I dare you to go to Vanuatu, ALONE, and spend there one year by yourself. Not as a tourist, but as person... learn to operate in daily life, try to learn the language, try to understand the music, the religious practice, get drunk, make local friends, tell them your fears, fall in love... learn to love the people, not the land - and then imagine yourself taking their land. If you did that, you would see how ridiculous and obscene and sad "reddit island" is.

Yes, I read the book. That is why I am quoting him. I've also read other of his books and papers, and I find Graeber to be one of the finest minds in academia. I am aware that some scholars are critical of his ideas, especially liberals, but that is expected because he is an anarchist. It is not true, though that 'everybody' 'is laughing'. 
And, I have to say, even if it were I wouldn't give a shit because I trust my criteria enough to be able to decide for myself what or who I find worthy to quote.

There are two kinds of debt, private debt and public debt. Private debt is when a private bank loans someone money; in this case the private bank expands the money supply when you sign the loan promising to pay back. They just literally create new money based on the IOU you signed. Then there is national debt, every country has it's own quirks, but roughly what happens is that the government asks for the money to the 'national bank' or the 'fed', and emits similar IOUS (national bonds) that say that said government will pay back. The bank (or 'fed) doesn't have the money, because money doesn't really exist, so they create it by counting the IOUs. It's basically a circlejerk. Fucked up aspects of this: 1 The 'national debt' is owed by all the citizens but when (if) it gets paid it gets paid to private bankers. 2 Who pays for the ridiculously enormous US military? The rest of the world. The US just prints more dollars or more bonds whenever they need money, the other countries have to actually do things. 
If that sounds creepy, wait until we talk about compound interest.

This is not about US tipping culture. Nothing would have happened if he had left no tip. No one would have run after him if the tip was nothing. What the socially inept OP did was insulting because from the perspective of the waitress it's as if he had left the tip in Paraguayan Guaranies bills, i.e. some weird useless foreign currency. That is insulting. The wallet was torn up as a way of restoring personal dignity because taking it back was only doubling down on the insult.
I've been in Bitcoin since 2010, and the community back then realised relatively quickly that as Bitcoin holders/enthusiasts, it is NOT our job to unsolicitedly evangelise (i.e. to annoy) to the people around us IRL. If you want to spread the word write articles, blog, make videos, or even share interesting links in your social media -and when doing so be spartan, don't overdo it. The public will come around eventually, gradually as the ecosystem matures and presents legitimate use cases that solve the real problems that real people have. This is the job of "the industry" not of us as users/enthusiasts.

Yeah, it's my point of view about the 'fiat or not fiat' debate. If we agree that 'code is law', then Bitcoin has all the ingredients of 'fiat', but with network logic. What this means in practice or doesn't can be debated ad infinitum... we will see how it evolves in practice, the consequences of shifting to 'network logic' are a whole different topic. As it turns, it has at least one major positive thing, and it is what I explain about being non-debt-based money.

You see, your response highlights precisely the problem i pointed above, you are genuinely convinced that you are doing "THEM" a favour. Even the language you use, language like "success", "talent", or "expand their economy", shows how this idea is planted in you (and in Western mentality) as an indisputable fact about reality. Catholic monks that went all over the world aiming to "save souls" had the same level of conviction.
The truth is, everyone from Aztecs to Aboriginals were better off without European 'saviours'.
Because the truth is, this is not really what "Reddit Island" is about, it is not about connecting or really being concerned about "the host nation". If it were, would there be such a wild range of options as in, Mauritius, Chile or Vanuatu? Yeah sure, you are really interested in their culture, only that you just happen to not even have a clue about who "they" are... Poor "third world" people are all the same to you, right?
The truth is that Reddit Island is about leveraging your economically privileged position to escape the oppressive conditions of the West.
You are buying foreign land, and settling and building there. Do you think that is not disruptive and -fucking yes- a form of colony? Just because you are using money as the weapon to gain control, and fancy catchwords to justify it, it doesn't mean it is a fair or desirable for the selling nation. Even if there are local individuals who are interested and will profit, it is a very bad deal for the selling nation, land is finite and precious. To change it for a handful of dollars is a long term mistake many make, and whoever takes advantage is pausing their ethics.
Better use of the energy, ingenuity, and money invested in this project would be to work to help change the conditions that make this system of life so wicked. To join the free software movement, OWS, Wikileaks, to fight against IP monopolists, RIAA. Help solve fucking global warming... Change the world, man. Don't do what all those before you already did, not only it is nocive and destructive, it is not even a bit as original as you think it is.

I honestly don't know the answers to these concerns, as I have just volunteered to get WIKISPEED to adopt the currency. I have taken the information they put forward at face value.
While I don't know about the history of the prize you ask about, I can tell you this: there is a lot of activity in terms of design and mechanics constantly going on. The tools for collaboratively making this cars are being used a lot by many people around the world. All this is true.
There are WIKISPEED garages being opened in Vietnam and Spain (and probably in other places, but these two I am sure of), where the open source designs globally produced by volunteers are used to make new cars. In fact, anyone (or any group of people) with mechanical skills can start a local WIKISPEED garage as well. Designs can be improved for local conditions, etc. This is real.
There have been questions similar to yours at Bitcointalk too. There are many questions that I just can't answer because I have no idea how, but I can promise to have Joe Justice (founder of WIKISPEED) directly answering all your questions soon. 
It is likely this AMA will take place at bitcointalk instead of but if it is possible we'll do both. In any case we will announce it here too.

Dude, it's Graeber, not Groeber. But if that was a typo and you are actually calling Graeber 'not a serious scholar' then perhaps this will change your mind (from wikipedia):
"In 1998, two years after completing his PhD, Graeber joined Yale University as an assistant professor.[2] In May 2005, the Yale anthropology department decided not to renew Graeber's contract, preventing him from coming up for consideration for tenure as he would otherwise have been scheduled to do in 2008. Pointing to Graeber's highly regarded anthropological scholarship, his supporters (including fellow anthropologists, former students, and activists) accused the decision of being politically motivated. More than 4,500 people signed petitions supporting him, and well-known British anthropologist Maurice Bloch called for Yale to rescind its decision.[2] Bloch, who had been a professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, and world renowned scholar on Madagascar, made the following statement about Graeber in a letter to the university:
"His writings on anthropological theory are outstanding. I consider him the best anthropological theorist of his generation from anywhere in the world."[8]
The Yale administration argued that Graeber's dismissal was in keeping with Yale's policy of granting tenure to few junior faculty and Yale gave no formal explanation for its actions. Graeber has suggested that his support of a student of his who was targeted for expulsion because of her membership in GESO, Yale's graduate student union, may have played a role in the university's decision.[9][2][10][11]
In December 2005, Graeber agreed to leave the university after a one-year paid sabbatical. That spring he taught two final classes: an introduction to cultural anthropology (attended by over 200 students) and a course entitled “Direct Action and Radical Social Theory” – the only explicitly radical-themed course at Yale he ever taught.
On 25 May 2006, Graeber was invited to give the Malinowski Lecture at the London School of Economics; his address was entitled "Beyond Power/Knowledge: an exploration of the relation of power, ignorance and stupidity".[12] The anthropology department at the university honors an anthropologist at a relatively early stage of their career to give the Malinowski Lecture each year, and only invite those who are considered to have made a significant contribution to anthropological theory. That same year, Graeber was asked to present the keynote address in the 100th anniversary Diamond Jubilee meetings of the Association of Social Anthropologists.[13] In April 2011 he presented the anthropology department's annual Distinguished Lecture at Berkeley.[14]"

Hidden orders, yes, but also -and mostly- hidden intentions. Meaning I am waiting for a price to be hit, at which point I will post my sell order. Likewise countless of bots placing orders as their conditions are met. Also there's trigger orders, where you indicate a price which, if hit, triggers for an order to be placed at a certain other price which might be lower or higher. Counting on the orderbook for finding out supply (or demand) is futile. The orderbook is actually a tool for deception.

Not necessarily. You don't need to even own bitcoins any more to 'sell' them, a.k.a. shorting. Moreover $1 deposited in bitfinex can be used to sell (short) up to $3 worth of bitcoin. Once you have succeeded in bringing the price down, you cover your short (buy again) at a lower price, but the coins you just 'bought' don't mean you own coins at all... you just went from negative coins to zero coins. As a residue of the operation there is a profit -which, importantly, is in dollars. You have just extracted value form the btc market without buying a single coin. 
Next, you wait until a nice sell signal to come in, like a double top, or a failure to break an established resistance line, and short again. If you are wealthy enough, you can even force the market to cross a line you want to have broken, or use order 'walls' to make sure your sell or buy orders are filled without slippage or commissions. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:51:08
If the price is $1 it's unfeasible to send someone, say, $10'000,000 using bitcoin, because just the process of buying the coins to do that would have a crazy effect on the price, and you would lose an unacceptably large ammount of money in the transaction.
The higher the price, the more useful btc is for more people.

It is 50x augmented gambling relative to the gamble of buying bitcoin in the first place. But then again buying any currency, or even buying a house is a gamble as well to a certain degree. This kind of deal (50x futures) is only suitable for experienced traders who are able, to a certain degree, to read the market and make short term informed decisions regarding whether to buy or sell, as opposed to investors who buy long term and don't risk losing their capital to small fluctuations.

Woah. kiva.org is a big deal. It would be very good both for bitcoin and for kiva if it happened. It would make things a lot easier and cheaper for kiva, and give bitcoin a very wide, grassroots reach and goodwill. Also, that would make its price rise, making it a good deal for low resource lenders, who would be able to profit from deflation.

No. Actually there are about 30 million usd in long swaps at finex right now, much more than the short figures, currently at 5 million usd. The previous record was 35 million, which was when the price was at 627 - right before this endless bear market started. We are near the record in long swaps right now. This is very scary, because it suggests that the price is currently upheld only by traders who are long on leverage, and who are bleeding interest (at high rates) by the day. These are VERY weak hands, that will sell if: 
a) bitcoin takes too long to rally (because interest); 
b) bitcoin rallies (beacuse they are in it for short term profit, rather than long term investment. Once they hit their target -usually 3% profit, althought here are many ways in which traders decide their targets-, they WILL sell. ); 
c) bitcoin drops (traders use stops -sell orders at predetermined levels- to avoid major losses, especially when they are in a leveraged position)
Which means all roads lead to massive selling.  A high number of leveraged longs -as we currently have- is a very bearish omen hanging over the market. It could be countered by even bigger demand -but smart money, because it is smart, is likely to just wait it out, let this leverage bubble pop, and buy at discounted prices. They have all the time in the world.

Moreover, there are lots of western traders who trade in Chinese exchanges, you cannot even assume those are not-global platforms either.

If the winners announce the price they bough at, and it is high, then the market price should go up too. The first auctions depressed the price because speculators assumed it would neutralise much of the demand. Now that the price is already quite low (relative to the 680 of the first auction), and that it is kind of 'old news', the reaction is not supposed to be very meaningful. But still there is some expectation about whether it is a non-event, or whether it depressed further the price, or whether bidders might actually pay higher prices than market price, which would probably mean the beginning of a huge rally.

I agree with everything you said... up until the last part. Mining might be wasteful, but its the only part of the economy that is. OP is right, Bitcoin reorganises priorities in a way that completely shifts people towards sustainability. Basically, since I first heard about Bitcoin, I stopped buying stuff I dont need (mostly). The total effect, I think, will make up for the consumption caused by mining by several orders of magnitude, with a massive positive net environmental impact. The fact that AnCaps/Libertarians (in the Ron Paul sense) love Bitcoin does not mean that it really leads to the kind of capitalism they envision.

The smart thing to do with $800 is to buy bitcoins. Right now that means 47 bitcoins (almost two whole blocks!). A mining rig would take ages to mine that much, and you would see the returns diminish dramatically.
Then when the price rises, he can get the same computer he would have bought in the first place, and still have some bitcoins left as savings. Probably even more bitcoins than the miner would have ever produced.

In the article I speculate somewhat about that. I think keynesians like Krugman ended up fixated with the methods like central banking, the state, etc. and in the process they lost the real goal which is prosperity.

Thanks, and thanks for your question. I am not sure what to make of it because 'elasticity' in economics refers to something different to what you are describing. 'Elasticity' refers to the degree in which the demand of a good is sensitive to the price. For example salt is very elastic because you could double the price overnight and people would still buy it (mainly because it is not expensive). See: 
But what you are asking is something different. Sort of like the agnosticism, or indifference, of the supply. I am not aware of the existence of relevant economic theories or terms to describe this property (but I am not an economist). You are right though, the whole world could be run with only one Bitcoin -wow. Or from another point of view, that is already the case, there is only one Bitcoin made of 21 million x 100 million Satoshis being released in chunks of 2500 million satoshis per block. Given the need miliSatoshis can be enabled and so on... I don't know what to make of it other than it seems brilliant, so simple, effective and clever... so I have to think more about it now!

You don't think that people who got killed because drugs are illegal in the US are victims of the fact that drugs are illegal in the US?
If 'some country' wants to ban drugs, that is fine. Many countries do, and even with harsher penalties for traffickers than the US. However, the US is the only one who has a 'certification process' that means economic sanctions for countries that they deem uncooperative with *their* laws. Moreover, have you read the embassy cables at all? The US actively pursues the imposition of their law as global, by whatever means necessary. This does not only include bribes and economic pressure, it also includes covert ops, military action, etc. Not only drugs are the subject of this approach, see what they are doing with TTP, ACTA, and copyright law in general. Then there are things like Monsanto and, bingo, the dollar, which is still the world's reserve currency only with the help of the absurdly huge US military. Colombia has been bathed in dollars coming from both the streets of the US and 'aid', because of the prohibition, creating all sorts of artificial tensions and endlessly feeding the conflict. This is no 'victim mentality', son, the truth is just much more complex than they have told you. Maybe you should embrace *that* issue.

To me the main point is that it is a currency/commodity that is created without creating debt or violence. I explained this view in an article titled "Understanding Bitcoin" (google it, i'm lazy to link). Also, Read David Graeber's book "Debt: The First 5000 Years".

VoIP communications (A Skype killer) would be huge. Diasporic communities encompass millions around the world, and it would lead to widespread adoption, as they would start using btc as a medium for remittances too.

No, I wouldn't say that that is a particularly defining characteristic of the Colombian ethos. Although people can be brutally honest if that's their character as a person. Others can be overtly diplomatic, which I would say that is actually more in the culture.
Now, having said that... Colombia is spelled with an 'o', never with a 'u'. So that means people from Colombia are called 'Colombians', rather than 'Columbians'.

I hate that lousy stereotype. Thailand is a great country, complex and rich in culture, full of kind and generous people, aside from the stunning nature and the best food in the world which by the way is super cheap. If anything, Thailand is the place in the world where happiness costs less. If you want prostitutes go to Germany.

not really, because Chavez has zero intention to sell venezuela, source: he has actually nationalised a lot of foreign companies.
now, if you are looking to buy venezuelan *goods*, then you are in for amazing bargains. devaluing the currency is a move to redefine the trade balance dynamics, and by the way, that is also what the us does by printing away... its called currency wars and this is what it looks like, expect more countries to devalue either by decrete, manipulation or printing, and enjoy as the bitcoin price soars!

When the us prints money its like they are fisting every other country in their ass, basically saying "we are taking your shit for free". The dollar is still the global reserve currency, meaning that all other countries store their wealth in dollars or us debt, for this reason printing dollars (devaluing the dollar) is quite an agressive move. Keynesianism + Imperialism is a truly fucked up combo

Man, no need to get personal....
I agree though, Keynes would be critical of Bitcoin in that sense, but bear in mind that what I am arguing here is not that Bitcoin is 100% keynesian, all I am saying is that "there are some aspects of Bitcoin that should in theory appeal to keynesians. This means that, conversely, there are some aspects of keynesianism that should appeal to bitcoiners." I mention the 'Old Bottles' idea, which looks a lot like mining, to support that point. I do this so that we can have more interesting ideas and debates instead of cheerleading for dead economists.
Also, you are right, I don't know all that much about economics.

This is amazing OP, I just emailed it to a colleague of mine who is theaching a course on "Money and Art" at a uni in Hong Kong. I think you've created the first Bitcoin app that has a valid claim to be called Art. This is full of meaning, it should make anyone realise that Bitcoin is something actually different and special, something that we dont even fully understand yet. We are just starting to explore the possibilities of the protocol and the blockchain. On top of it, I can't thing of a better think to show people who say 'its a ponzy scheme'. At the very least this would make anyone think twice, and realise there are some strange intricacies they need to understand first.   
Cheers OP!

And in this book: "The Memory Bank"
Keith Hart is probably the world's top anthropologist of money.
@_date: 2013-02-09 09:27:20
well, yeah, but it also depends on what side of the global chess you are in... when the us prints dollars they are doing just that to every other country, so for a government to devaluate is often a survival move. again, thats what a currency war is about

On a similar note, although strictly a different problem: By a very large margin, most of the bitcoins are owned by people in the US, Europe and Australia. And more recently, China. If Bitcoin takes off as the new world reserve currency, we will see worse impoverishment and exploitation of Africa, South America and Asia.

Well, no of course, but the point of this thread is not "how to kill skype". The question was what would be a good product to offer via Bitcoins, and I suggest VoIP, as in the paid-for portions of Skype. I constantly call to landlines and mobile numbers in different countries, and Skype is costing me a fortune, even if it is way cheaper than traditional long-distance calls.
@_date: 2013-05-10 02:19:06
Maybe, but keynesiansim is based on the government being able to print money, and BTC is based on pretty much the opposite premise. 
so I was wondering how those two could be reconciled, somehow. I ask not in order to argue, but because I'm writing about this.
