I just don’t understand how not giving the IRS the money they’re owed is the right approach. Especially after getting a letter the pretty explicitly says “we’re pretty sure you owe us money.”

The sarcasm wasn’t a problem for me, I knew it was a joking way of being on my side.  But I appreciate you looking out!

Thanks for the response. I finally got in touch with someone helpful by going back through the crypto letter hotline. They said that there’s something wrong happening and they’re looking into it. Hopefully I’ll hear back soon. It’s really nice speaking to someone who isn’t just transferring me to a different department!
The person I spoke to has been really pleasant and helpful. Everyone at the IRS has actually been really nice.
My biggest fear is also having this hang over me without knowing what’s happening. Uncertainty and lack of clarity is really stressful, especially when I’m honestly trying to resolve it. 
I had even set all the money aside back in 2017 when I learned what I’d done wrong. Its stressful not knowing anything and being kept in the dark.

I’ve amended 2013-2016 because it affects all of those. 2017 was done correctly. They didn’t accept 2013 and 2014. 
But that’s a good point. Maybe there are two issues. Not accepting 2013 and 2014, and ALSO my accountant doing them all wrong. 
Although I did a lot of research and feel like I very accurately represented my transactions. Including treating purchases and payment for work as trades. Got very deep into the nitty gritty.
