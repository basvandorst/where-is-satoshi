Yes it would. More purity = Less negative health effects. No prosecution = Less money wasted on victimless crimes, no black market, etc.

Yes, I agree with you on that the basic idea is good and well meant probably. However, I think there is a lot of potential for abuse, as I mentioned above, and it is used as an excuse for totally monitoring citizens.

Yeah but what's a dirty deed? Selling drugs is not I would argue. So it becomes problematic because a corrupt government can deem anything it wants a "dirty deed". Best example is the war on drugs which just shows that we are still living in the dark ages as far as freedom and knowledge go.

Pure Heroin isn't even all that terrible physically if used safely you can look it up, however it is very addictive of course. I'm not saying it's a good idea to promoto heroin usage, but making it illegal only makes the situation worse. Because now, in addition to all negative effects that heroin has you also have impurity, social isolation due to stigma, legal issues for addicts and a black market emerges.
Education is the way to go, not criminal persecution.

What's the issue with having an open marketplace where adults can trade substances who they wish to consume? Silk Road made using drugs safer for a lot of people so I don't get how you could call him criminal scum.

You're not sponsoring drug cartels, that's the entire point of silk road to have an open marketplace where everyone can participate.

Money laundering isn't a crime.

What a shame, the Internet is getting worse and worse by allowing central parties to make decisions on what is appropriate and what isn't. It's simply censorship in its full form.
What needs to happen is a decentralization of all those affected websites, so they can actually be censorship resistant.
The technology behind Bitcoin really is saving the world by making censorship like that impossible.

Ok I admit that's false in most jurisdictions I guess. But imo it's just made up by governments as an excuse to stick their nose into everything.

Keeping them illegal doesn't stop anyone from taking them. It only creates more problems.

It's not a simple issue of course, I'm not saying opiates are harmless. Just trying to point out that prison sentences and hard punishment doesn't make the situation better.

Some drugs, but most are pretty safe actually (LSD, shrooms, weed), when compared to seriously harmful substances like alcohol.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:44:19
Not all drugs. The reason those cartels exist is because they're illegal.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:58:11
Really? So the shrooms I grow and the weed my friend grows is killing people in Mexico. If only I had known that sooner...

It's not proven that that's what he did. They just had a problem with the drug market.
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:54:10
Our society would be a lot better off if you could actually buy meth legally (Not necessarily from a grocery store though lol). There would be less violent crimes and less harm from laced drugs. Also many people could start seeing the police as an actual helper instead of an enemy for once. It's laughable how much propaganda is being spread against drugs nowadays.

Cannabis doesn't cause loss of brain cells and there is no evidence it causes any significant harm to the brain at all.

Do you think it's just that you can get locked up in prison for growing mushrooms in your basement?
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:24:17
He shouldn't be a criminal, US law is just draconian and outdated.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:24:07
Yeah but also only as long as people believe that thing they're making or doing has value. There is no such thing as intrinsic or real value.

Bitcoin isn't limited by borders tho, it doesn't depend on any country "allowing it". So yes, it might have a negative impact, but it won't stop it.
