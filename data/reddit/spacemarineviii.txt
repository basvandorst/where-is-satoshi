Europe. You?
I initiated a SEPA transaction. It was a fairly large sum but their support have confirmed that the bank received the transaction. It is now in 'processing' before it gets credited, whatever the hell that means.

I need a drop because Bitstamp is taking forever to credit my account. I had hoped to buy a few days ago.

Are Bitstamp considered to be a 'reliable' and 'authentic' exchange?
Their customer support seems to be non-existent. 
Conversely Coinbase seem to respond to emails within a matter of hours. However I am not a fan of their weekly 10k limit. What if I wanted to put transfer more than that?

I would welcome a drop to 8k. I really hope it happens.

I'm praying for a dip. I need to buy.

I transferred money from Revolut to Bitstamp last night. Still hasn't fucking arrived.
I lost the discount. Bad luck for me as usual.

Good joke.

A euro account? Can't I use my UK details to open the Revolut account but send the money into Coinbase via EUR? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:00:24
Perfect. So I presume you add Revolut as a bank account in Coinbase? Time to make a Revolut account...
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:35
Nope. I too did. Fuck. It's dipping below $10k now. $9.8k on Bitstamp. 
Guess I'll just wait for the inevitable rise in a month.

I brought at 11k. But I have no choice but to hold. 
Will buy more now seeing as the price is tanking.

Personal or business account?

Could I also use Revolut as a middleman to avoid the 3.5% credit card fee from buying BTC from Coinbase? I presume you can transfer to Coinbase using Revolut, right?
Or could I use transferwise?

I've lost $4k in a day. FFS

I meant for Revolut, but the website directed me to the phone app. That's how I signed up. I think I have a normal Coinbase account. Are there any advantages in creating a business CB account?
