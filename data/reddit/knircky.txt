right. 
bitcoin used to be 90% of my portfolio. now it is about 40%.
Once u ever make a transaction that is instant on stee, and use counterparty where u wait for a transaction for 45 min, because of slow block u will understand the power of other blockchains.
I am pretty much so much invested in bitcoin because the market seems to disagree with my assessment of how I would evaluate blockchains.

Nope. Both tx can confirm in same block even. Done it many times

Agree. Support is very good. Dealt with them a bunch and the experience is always good.
@_date: 2016-04-08 03:32:00
So two things:
1. Yes there is risk. But it is managed and you did get your refund.
2. You should not be buy anything for a 5% discount on purse. You could have saved 20-30% and then the hassle is worth it (I think).
I have made 30 purchases and I'm guessing there are issues with 1/3 of them. However they were always resolved so far by the escrow. I bought a 1k camera and had no issue. There is serious money to be safed.
I do understand your concern and I agree with your sentiment it's not worth 5%.

If you really have a profitable not, you should create a service were people can have it trade.
I would use such a service.

The 2k is your daily insta buy limit. The 10k is your weekly limit. So you can buy 3k in one day but you would have to wait for the btc to be released until the arch clears.

I think the value of Bitcoin and public chains is open finance.
However Bitcoin has a few issues for corporations today:
- privacy
- unstable currency
- cost and scale
Finance is a big problem that is very expensive for corporations today. CFO have no idea where their assets are and need banks to make all transactions which is expensive and slow. Technically Bitcoin solves this with instant transactions and perfect visibility.
However due to the above issues Bitcoin is useless to them. So they are creating private blockchain that solve the issues above. Instead of expensive and slow pow they use permissions. Instead of btc they use tokens that represent $ iou's. Which solves all the problems above. With this they can at least optimize internal finance and banks can create payments that are instant and international.
Long term this makes no sense as it would be simpler to use an open network such as Bitcoin,but for that to work the challenges above need to be overcome first.
What I see in the Bitcoin space is closed eyes for the real issues Bitcoin has and a failure to understand what needs to be done in order to make it work for corporations.

Again the centralization does not come from the size of the blocks but other design decisions. Small blocks create more centralization on top of the other design instruments that lead to centralization by restricting the use of bitcoin to fewer people.
If people would actually care about decentralization, why is no-one working or even thinking about solutions that lead to decentralization?
Again I call BS on what you are saying and everyone else so agressively telling the world that big blocks create centralization. It's like the argument that locking me up in a room makes me free because nothing can happen to me. You are either retarded or trying to fool the world.
@_date: 2015-12-12 10:01:03
Use coinbase. Transactions are free ( they pay the fee)
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:52:37
Anything including humans can own bitcoins
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:29:42
You can also use the Internet without google if it makes u happy.
@_date: 2015-12-03 06:40:17
That's because coinbase pays that fee for you.
One reason why using coinbase for small transactions is very smart
@_date: 2015-12-17 10:33:17
I dont think fees will go up significantly. 1mb blocks will just push transaction to centralized organizations.
We will then just not use the blockchain anymore to transact normally, instead companies will settle among each other.
This will then of course lead to the same centralized system as we have with fiat. Blocksize limit as such create centralization. But I doubt this will be a problem long term. Bitcoin is a democratic system which will either adapt or die. Either way evolution will take care of things.
@_date: 2015-06-21 01:27:42

A miner actually needs to be a node. However the reasons why nodes are not popular it's because they are resource intensive/expensive to run and offer no reward for it. 
What I am saying is, if you want to solve the decentralization problem of Bitcoin this should be addressed while calling for other things is simply ineffective.
@_date: 2015-12-13 19:14:40
There is no reason for anyone to run a node, or no incentive to do so except for fun.
Making a node easier to run is not going to change this. If you want more nodes you need to change the incentive structure.
@_date: 2015-12-04 14:07:07
Well ur simply have to wait until the first payment clears and then it's fine.
That's simply how banking works. They can't just give u btc without getting fiat and it takes a while for fiat to move from one account to another
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:34:21
I signed up and bought btc 5 minutes later. That's why. How would u buy btc today without coinbase? U can't unless U wire money to an exchange. That involves walking to a bank for most in the us.
@_date: 2014-08-01 04:48:17
Actually its much simpler than that.
Think about how much money there is and how much market share of the that money bitcoin will have at the end.
If we assume there is around 100 trillion in the world and there are 21M bitcoin
100000M : 21M = 4751M per bitcoin.
Now if bitcoin gets a market share of 20% of world currency it would have to be worth around 1M.
1M for the bitcoin price could be if bitcoin replaces the USD. 5M if it replaces everything.
In the end its about how is all this 100M split up. The pie today is dominated by the USD and other big currencies. I think BTC will be the new global currencies in the future that also means i believe it will have to be worth about 1 to 5 Million USD in todays buying power.
Now i think there might be other currencies alongside BTC, however there has usually been an anker everything is tied to. today this is the USD, before that it was gold.
In the Crypto world BTC already has this anker status, however i think it would be easy to replace at this point since it is only 10B cap at this point.
I dont think that BTC and fiat money can coexist. If I am wrong here than it is possible that bitcoin may stay way below this cap and maybe just reach 1% of global currency.
But i believe it will either reach a tipping point or go away. I think the biggest thread to bitcoin is that it will be replaced by something better i.e.ether)

I don't understand why anyone would use it to buy btc, however it's an awesome service to buy products at a discount.
You can buy btc at coinbase and then use those to buy Amazon stuff at a discount. If u do 15% it goes pretty quickly.
I've had one situation where a guy wanted to scam me, but the purse team was awesome at getting me my btc back.
So I had a few very good experiences and I'm pretty sure u cannot scam or be scammed due to the fact that shipments can be tracked.

Yes its quite simple. Merchant adoption is actually bad for the bitcoin price (but good for bitcoin overall).
Merchant adoption does two key things that affect the price of bitcoin negatively:
1. In increases the velocity of bitcoin. (the higher the velocity the lower the price of btc may be)
2. It makes people sell bitcoin indirectly. If you buy stuff with bitcoin the merchants sell the btc u used right away via coinbaise or bitpay. As such u might as well have sold the btc urself on the market. Unless you are buying the btc right back this is obviously bad for the price.
It is still important that all merchants adopt bitcoin since this is one part of the user adoption. however in order for btc price to go up people have to buy btc vs other currency and merchant adoption does the opposite.
I believe this is one of the key reasons why the price went down in the last 6 month. We have seen many merchants jump on board but not more users.
In order for btc to grow again we will likely need some applications that are so useful to users that it makes sense for them to jump into the btc market. I think storj could be such a project.
@_date: 2014-06-11 02:31:35
yes I agree there are still hurdles and everything is bit too complicated.
However there is a big difference between betmoose and what counterparty is doing: a trusted 3rd party that is there to make money.
AFAIK counterparty is the first truly peer to peer betting. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 02:57:19

I always thought that putting ATMs on international airports makes the most sense, until I realized that the cost to buy btc in one country and sell in another is going to be prohibitive.
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:58:44
I think this completely misses the point.
Yes Bitcoin is not user friendly, however that is not the main problem. The main problem is that there is no reason to use Bitcoin for anything.
What Bitcoin needs is an application that makes it desirable.

Certainly fake. Bill not that stupid
@_date: 2014-08-01 04:17:24
Yes if a country would use btc instead of their own currency that would of course do the trick.

I think u are confused about my confusion. I simply dont think that these ROW countries provide that value bitcoin needs in order to catapult its value where it needs to be. Maybe u can enlighten me. (it seems you think differently).
I personally believe that bitcoin will be driven by the first world the US in particular. Except if the US Gov will shut it down, at which point there will likely be somewhat of a reboot for bitcoin including the price of it.

So as long as it moves it will be fine. But I don't think it can stay very well where it is right now.

Like so many bitcoin tech it is not made with usability in mind.
They claim it is made for crowd sourcing, yet it's not easy to understand how I could use swarm to create a campaign.
It's simply easier to go to kickstarter. If you want to be able to compete with existing models u have to better not worse then them.
I have looked a few times on their website to try to understand how it works and what the business model is. I have no issue understanding how everything works at existing crowfunding sites. After reading the swarm website I am simply don't understand how I can use it from and end user or business perspective.
Same like counterparty. Most functionalities are not thought thru and designed from the end user perspective. It's simply easier to use other technologies to do what these tech do.

im happy you like betmose. the point here is that this is the first time you can bet peer to peer with counterparty and the feed from xbet.
betmose is a betting site using bitcoin. nothing wrong with that. there are  few like it but there is no other way to bet peer to peer as far as i know.
@_date: 2014-11-15 05:31:04
Why don't u use counterparty

Decentralized exchanges like counterparty are not being used.
If u want them why don't u use them!?!
For fiat decentralized does not really work.
@_date: 2014-12-23 23:53:03
What country are you buying from. I would suggest coinbase or some of the exchanges directly. I think 30k is a small enough sum that u can buy it from an exchange.
To me the easiest way to buy is coinbase. It works in many countries, US and EU. Really it depends on what country you are from.
@_date: 2014-07-23 04:54:24


This is true. The key issue however i believe is that there no application that is useful with bitcoin to mainstream. buying with btc is not simpler than using other forms of payment. There needs to be a reason why people want to use btc. paying is not it. the payment network is also not something that is super special. visa and banks can surely find ways to compete (become more efficient) with btc in this regard.
@_date: 2014-10-30 03:34:05
Build a gambling site that works in dollars, the betting that counterparty does but make it user friendly
@_date: 2014-06-11 00:26:48
This could be the killer app that could drive adoption.
Sport betting is a 1 trillion $ industry and of just a small amount of this flows into bitcoin we are along for a nice ride.

Yes, however u can't expect for consumers to run a server and keep it secure just to hold some bitcoin.
Some people might hold all their cash under the mattress, however this might not be quite so safe.
I am always surprised how much people expect everyone to run an actual btc wallet. to my that is simply illogical to expect from consumers.
@_date: 2014-07-21 03:36:12
yes i agree this has not been explained
@_date: 2014-07-23 04:56:32
i am still looking for a truly new application that bitcoin brings to the world vs just making something a bit more efficient. Of course the money system with bitcoin is better. however that's not enough to make the world turn the other way. we need something that has not been here before that is now possible due to the technology.
@_date: 2014-10-18 20:43:35
Velocity especially allows for a smaller market cap.
However ultimately the value of Bitcoin should be a reflection of the value of the underlying economy that uses it.
Currently there is almost no economy that runs on Bitcoin only.
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:03:42
There are also people that get paid in Bitcoin. So yes obvious there is a few billion usd worth of economy going on, but overall it's not even a scratch compared to hundreds of trillion $ of just the usd.

Why not use coinbase

Coinbase pays miners fee so always use them for micro transactions. ( free to u)
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:40:35
Why would u think coinbase is unsafe in any way.
What other way would a new user both optain btc and store them safely. 
Coinbase is by far the best option for new user as well as anyone that is not a hacker 
@_date: 2014-06-16 07:52:22
again i dont think u understand that coutnerparty allows peer to peer betting and this is the first time u can bet peer to peer. this has many implications and is different than running an online site with bitcoin vs fiat.
 
@_date: 2014-06-11 17:16:39
counterparty has its own currency XCP. When you bet you always use those. they can be used in escrow more efficiently than btc (i.e. u don't need to wait for 6 confirmations but instead they happen instantly).
BTC were burned for the generation of XCP.
In order to get BTC you would sell the XCP for bitcoin. you can do this on the distributed exchange peer to peer as well.
@_date: 2014-08-04 03:59:57
yes, these countries usually exploit the power their currency gives them more than the US and other western words. it would have to be the people that adopt the currency.
I find it more likely that western worlds will seek the innovation and potential that bitcoin bring, before these other countries do. but maybe i am wrong. today however it shows that most of the bitcoin volume is USD based and also most of the VC and development seems US based, followed by EU.
So i don't see the 3rd world coming along until we have more adoption in the west. again maybe i am wrong.
@_date: 2014-08-04 18:26:44


i very much agree with this. while i believe that wave will have to be generated by the west.

there is no reason at this time for a "normal" user to buy stuff with bitcoin. as such there can be no mainstream adoption at this time.
We need an application that makes bitcoin useful to the mainstream before it con be adopted.
@_date: 2014-07-22 22:19:37


I disagree with you. It literally takes as much time to buy bitcoin at coinbase as buying anything online now that they have instant buy.
People today can be hacky and download a bitcoin wallet or they can use coinbase which works like paypal. btw paypal is also not faster than coinbase.  
Bitcoin is not easy enough i agree. but not because of coinbase.

@_date: 2014-12-10 07:53:03
I believe that is impossible. The price at this level means Bitcoin is unsustainable. The market cap is simply too small for the currency to be useful.
Btc needs to be above 100k per coin for the btc to become meaningful, else I think it would tend towards 0.
@_date: 2014-07-21 21:31:57
you can buy on coinbase instantly from the start.

Yes it can. However bitcoin needs to gain market share. That means bitcoin price needs to go up.
If bitcoin is at 10k not much will happen but once bitcoin gains a few trillion market cap, serious fiat must have moved into bitcoin. At this point the $ and other fiats must suffer from loss of purchasing power and the whole money system should swap over to bitcoin.
I think this is inevitable if bitcoin will keep increasing in value. On the other hand if bitcoin does not increase in value i do not think that it will be able to survive as a currency.
@_date: 2014-12-14 07:27:13
Banking in The US is really the worst. They still use checks as main way to pay things here. So thinking adoption could be better because the banking system is so awesome is a bit illusional.
I agree though that btc is useless for normal people, even when they are smart. What is needed is a killer app. So far Bitcoin does not offer anything valuable to the public. As such until some real useful thing will come that will want people to have btc the price should go down. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 06:17:02
Blabla bla. Exactly where is coinbase worse than any of the solutions you mentioned. And please let us know what ur criteria is.
@_date: 2017-02-15 11:43:40
Yes I see that as a possible outcome.
However I think it is also possible that other blockchains may take over. As a result I think it is prudent to diversify. 
I also see that there are blockchains that will co- exist and I believe that blockchains in general will be a new form of aganisations in the future. As a result I expect many blockchains with different value propositions to exist.
Lastly I believe Bitcoin is very bad at its main goal to be cash or money due to its lack by design to store value.
Hence my investment in various other chains.
@_date: 2017-02-10 19:52:29
Better than coinbase? Wut?
@_date: 2017-02-13 03:39:23
When it comes to buyingg bitcoins i have not seen any better alternative. If coinbase would get a 100% grade i cant see anyone even get 50%.
Hence my confusion. Again show me one example that comes even close to security, functionality and price.
The support at coinbase is horrible though, yet this would be on my priority list towards the bottom.
@_date: 2017-02-14 07:08:08
Well yes. But BU would break this.
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:05:37
Well when the price rises, mining equipment that was not profitable before may be profitable again so it makes sense that this rises quickly
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:32:37
if you buy btc in one country you are going to pay 1+% in fees. You can then go to another country and use an btc atm to get ur money out. But the atm will charge 2-5% (they pay at least 1%).
So using btc to move money into another country cost you more than going to an ATM and getting money this way or using a credit card.
In addition there is the volatility that poses risk of up to 1-10% provided travel takes a day.
Me personally i would rather use my CC or ATMs at this point in time.
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:12:41
Pretty much everyone bying btc in us has to use coinbase.
Still 10% seems like a ton

These six aspect are not what is relevant for money. They are just minimum requirements.

A hardfork where a chain is the longest chain with more hashing power and minority economic support is impossible.

I think we first need to worry about actually making it useful by having a registry, a website where we can  publish stream and also find streams.
In addition we would need some user system so we can have ratings as well.
Bitcoin service are often just breadcrumbs of solution.
We need to learn to think in a way about solutions that are comprehensive From the perspective of the user experience.
This is another awesome solution that on its own is just not useful and gets crushed by any of the centralized competitors.

xbet.io which is the first feed provider for sports charges 1%. That is a huge reduction for bettors vs 10% in a normal sportbook. As such i think there is good inscentive for people to use the service. but they need to know about it first :-)
its surely simpler to publish public information vs being a casino.

Are you sure. It seems to me like a very safe way to suggest something that will never happen. it looks to me like the segwit team wants their solution to never actually be implemented.
How else can one assume that something of a change so radical will be approved by 95% of miners.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:26:27
Right, but if the economic majority does not support the new fork it will crash in price. At this point miners will switch to the chain that makes them more money.
Miners follow the price not the other way around. As such u cant have more hashing power with economic minority.
U cant have a chain that has no value and contain all the hashing power.
@_date: 2014-11-24 16:10:59
Yes, no problems at all

So I see you like bitcoin but hate everything else.
I share some of your concern, but mostly I think that many other crypto have better security and functionality than bitcoin. Bitcoin on its own has a different application than many of the other projects, so they don't always compete (i.e. MAID)
It is funny that the coin you find OK (LTC) would be one of the worst to invest in IMHO because it is the same as bitcoin without infrastructure or network effect or brand.
I disagree with your assessment of ETH. They have shown to be very strong development team, lots of projects that leverage it and I like the ICO initial distribution of coins. I would think that ETH is one of the more likely candidates to de-throne bitcoin. Also their POW is more decentralized than bitcoins and the POS they will implement will be more decentralized and safer even still. 
I do believe however that many of the issues with bitcoin can be fixed, most easily the scalability. With less than 20 miners and effectively a handful of real miners, blocks could easily be 1gb large and scale to visa levels even with todays tech.
The hardest issue bitcoin faces is security and centralization imho. It would be fairly easy to corrupt said miners, by anyone with power (i.e. states) or money (i.e. any company) and harm or control bitcoin effectively.
I am less worried about which chain with survive i.e. bitcoin vs other coins as I think the market will sort it out.
@_date: 2017-02-24 23:13:45

I think price is ultimately important. In the end the value of btc must be reflected by its price.
Btc has only made it when its price is close to 1m.  That would mean it has captured a significant part of the world currency market.
At that point transaction volume should also be high.
Usage and transactions are going to drive the price. What btc is missing is a key reason to have it.
@_date: 2017-02-06 04:42:05
So in the end one would only create blocks that a supermajority I.e. 75%+ would accept and likewise only accept blocks that a supermajority accepts as well, irrespective of node or miner

I don't think so. Mining does not provided value. It's not like buying a house under building cost as people will need houses and the market has to rebound or building cost must come down, because people will always need houses. 
There is no need for bitcoin. U could use other coins or money than btc as such there is no minimum value that Bitcoin is intrinsically worth.

Neither, settlement layer does only work with stable value and currency needs stable value also.

I dont think the halving will be such a big event. I cannot imagine that hashing power will drop quickly due to the fact that hw will not simply be turned off. Even if miners are dropping out they will sell their HW to miners.
Mining is an equilibrium market and I think this will work. Sure adjusting the difficulty more frequently would be better, but i don't think this will be an event.
Other than that I agree with Brian.
@_date: 2017-02-12 22:15:24
I dont disagree with you that alternatives are a good thing. I wish i had more options to buy btc.
But inhave never had an order cancel on coinbase/gdax and inhave done thousands of orders there.
I also cannot imagine that accounts will be closed without reasons or at rdm. Yes i have had issues with their support and know of challanges other friends have had when increasing linits etc due to said crappy support.
In short your concern is something any company and bank has to deal with. Its not like gemini is any different in that regard and it is also not like u can buy bitcoins with cash at bitsquare or localbitcoins.

the fact that coinbase does not response in such cases and shows to have no support in my book is inexcusable.
Coinbase used to have amazing support, but this has gone to shit. there are several things that deeply worry me about coinbase and the brand has seriously suffered for me.
I personally have had issues with support as well.
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:29:55
The last few days I've been thinking, what if we get rid of money altogether and make hard assets liquid via btc tech.
Could that be an option.
I.e. Markets could establish value of things and one could then buy stuff like groceries via anything of value. I.e u go to Walmart and use your stocks or gold or whatever to pay for stuff but money does not exist anymore. Instead everything is relative to everything which is transparent thru a blockchain enabled market. I.e Walmart would know how much of stocks or gold it would want from you since the markets are transparent.

I find however that most of the time people argue with things that distract from the actual issue and try to call me stupid, yet fail to actually be able to present logical arguments.
Your post are a perfect example of this.
The fact is that Bitcoin is being hijacked from its original vision and corrupted and centralized. Some of this are of course design flaws satoshi made (i.e. Pow and voting power based on it)
I am very curious to see if Bitcoin will get back on track to be a decentralized peer to peer digital cash system or whatever the current parties in control deem it to be.

So it is very easy to understand some problems but hard to find a solution.
A good example is miner centralization. We understand that it's a problem and how it comes about, yet it's hard to actually come up with a solution that works.
On the other hand the blocksize issue to me is very straightforward and finding a solution there seems very simple.
@_date: 2016-03-06 03:54:17
You know Bitcoin is actually not that complicated.

Capitalism: an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.
Op seems to think capitalism is desiged for the "elites". Capitalism just means let economic forces roam free. It seem OP fundamentally misunderstands Bitcoin. Bitcoin actually is a capitalistic form of money since it takes away the ability of authorities to control or enforce it.
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:47:13
How does it work?
@_date: 2016-03-09 21:14:17
Then why is core not caring about decentralization and why is the blockllimit which is key for centralization defended! If Bitcoin would be decentralized and we have a blockllimit than its is still centralized since it can only operated via 3rd party layer which is what p2p is supposed to prevent.
Why are there no solution proposed for the key problem of centralization which is mining centralization.
Great article by the way. However I disagree that a fork is an attack. In fact a fork
Per definition cannot be an attack unless the system is not decentralized.
The only way to attack Bitcoin is by controlling it&gt; i.e. Centralizing it. Unfortunately we are likely already in a state where mining is potentially centralized. At least there are likely few people that together control 50+% of hashing power and could be corrupted easily.
So again we need to fix mining and make it decentralized, every other issue is secondary including the blocksize debate.
Unfortunately changing mining will not be possible since miners control Bitcoin.

I have been looking at coinbase to be like apple is in tech: A comprehensive brand that solves customers problems end to end and is pricy with good value.
It seems to me that coinbase is focusing on the things that make them money while forgetting the end to end customer value chain. This is what apple does well (they dont make money with software, yet they have the best software out there). When brian wrote how they are not a wallet, i think this is a manifestation of this 1/2 ass strategy. I personally am worried about this. When i buy apple product i know, they make 50% profit from the money they get, but at the same time i expect certain value from them via their brand. i.e. support when i have issues and good quality product overall.
Coinbase used to be like this (they had perfect support and the best wallet), but somehow they seem to be cost cutting and forgetting customer needs and what a product means comprehensively. I hope they listen and get back on track.

I did not say many nodes are bad. Miners are also nodes. Today there are like 3-10 miners. That's a problem. The 5k nodes cannot mitigate this centralization problem.  Of course nodes are good and many are better. However a node is really only a node if it mines. What we refer to nodes today are non-mining nodes, all they do is relay information. That's an important part but even more important is mining.

Yes Szabo and many others think that bitcoin should be a settlement layer (because it does not scale).
However i do not understand why bitcoin as a settlement layer has value. I can see how it would be nice if we could use bitcoin only as a settlement layer, however just because we want it that way since technically it would be simpler does not explain that it will also work that way.
Again, proveded that there are coins that function as coffe money, why would anyone use other money than coffee money to settle.
The difference between digital money and physical money is that there is no difference in the cost and effort for settlement. Hence is there is coffee money u can also transact large amounts in it. In real life there is a difference between settling 1 cent and $100 and millions. But in the digital world the cost of settlement for 1cent or 1M is the same.  I understand that there might be a minimum cost per transaction (right now a btc transaction cost about 10 USD) and there might be services that make this cheaper on top of the basic layer, however restricting the functionality and reducing how much can be processed and increase centralisation are all things that go against the value and  security of bitcoin. This is why I do not understand, how folks that are supposed to have some understanding of this tech can argue and fight for this settlement feature, which too me is like a movement to reduce bitcoins functionality to increase its value. Logically this seems perverse. Or in other words, we think it does not scale, so lets artificially reduce its scale even more: how does that make any sense?

What you consider a miner is not a miner. Somebody that contributes hashing power to a pool is not a miner, the pool is the miner. The guy providing hashing power is just a resource (like a cpu) for the miners, giving him hashing power. Ie right now we have a hand full of miners in bitcoin effectively. Satoshi described nodes as miners. Anything a node does a miner does as well there is nothing a node is that a miner is not, since you can only mine as a node (you need to receive tx and blocks, validate them &amp; propagate). Miners in addition also create blocks.
The trouble is what determines the decentralization of bitcoin we have a handful of. That is not centralized, but it is also not decentralized in a way that bitcoin needs to be secure. It seems nobody especially core cares about or is working on keeping bitcoin decentralized.
I definitely agree with you on the last point. If you run a node, you should not be worried about the blocksize, and the same is true for miners.
Thinking that users should run nodes is IMHO a key misunderstanding of how bitcoin works and reality.
Nodes are cheap, dont cost much to run and u can create thousands of them if u want. Mining not so much, it would take quite some effort to overpower the miners. So back to the original question: i dont think we ought to look at node count too much. What actually matters is how many classic blocks are mined if we want to understand the true support and likelihood of a classic fork.

As long as mining is decentralized the network is healthy, else it is not. You can have 1, 10k, 100k nodes that don't mine, it really does not matter, as long as the miners are connected to each other. It is not the nodes that need to accept the work and propagate tx but the other miners. Blocks and tx need to reach miners for bitcoin to function. 
Bitcoin arguably has a mining centralization issue. Blocklimits create a further centralization layer on top of that. Judging from the action of Core I would guess that this centralization is a key goal. I wish them good luck, but I am betting that this will happen longterm (by holding btc).
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:18:42
Right. Bitcoin currently is getting more and more centralized:
&lt;5 miners have majority
&lt; 2 asic provider
1 development team/client (core)
And current developments seem to encourage this trend. I wonder if btc breaks out of this cycle if ever.
Currently any effort to de-centralize is being attacked.
I think solutions exist in other blockchains.....
I am very curious to what the future brings and how btc will adapt to be competitive. I am still bullish on Bitcoin and hold much of my portfolio in it. But I am very worried about mining centralization and the core team.
@_date: 2016-03-08 06:43:30
You are distracting. Even if what you are saying is true, it still makes no sense to cap the blocks. There is no value in the blocksize other than if you want to limit bitcoins most basic functionality which is making transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-08 07:48:59
Settlement per definition means a 3rd party does the transaction, which is exactly what you would do to defeat Bitcoin which is supposed to be p2p.
Bitcoin is going thru a phase of centralization, which seems to be supported by the current parties of power, miners followed by core deva. The next layer which is the industry seems to want p2p, more  cheaper transactions. Again it is interesting for me to watch to see what Bitcoin will be.
@_date: 2016-03-06 03:13:14
Miners are also nodes. So if there were a healthy amount of miners ther also would be enough nodes.
If however we only have a handful of miners and they get compromised there is nothing many nodes can do to prevent such an attack....
Yes nodes can do some part such as propagating information however the key determining factor is mining decentralization.

Running a node is just burning fuel for the purpose of governance. You may use the blockchain for business purposes or need to validate transaction for any other reason.
Bitcoins consensus es executed by the miners and evaluation by the market. So you can either:
- run a miner (that makes sense if you have an advantage over other miners somehow so this is not sensible for 99.999% of people, but still a technical option)
- participate in the market either by holding and buying, or not holding and selling bitcoins.
Everything else is practically irrelevant for the purpose of power in bitcoin. It is a very simple governance structure. Stop fudding around by pretending silly things like you can have a voice by running a node. You can validate tx, blocks and propagate, accept them. That is different from having a voice or contributing from consensus.
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:30:47
you are mixing up the security of the individual to the security of the network. So yes folks can run a node to validate tx however the network needs miners to be decentralized for security.
Or in other words you just explained that nodes don't actually have much to do with the question of decentralization....
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:48:07
i think we must look at the tx fees to measure the demand. The mempool will adjust automatically to never be too large. What will really measure how full the blockchain is how much are people paying to get into blocks.

There is nothing wrong with a technical limit to the blockchain. There is no way around it fees are ok as well will form equilibrium between miners and users. However currently we are creating artificial limitations to increase centralization. Thats idiotic -- i mean not useful for the bitcoin ecology, certainly for some players.


I am sorry but if we had one miner and one million nodes that don't mine, we don't have a decentralized network. If we have one node and one million miners, we do.
The focus on nodes is simple emotional laziness, since we don't want to talk about the elephant in the room (mining centralization that can only be run in datacenters) we talk about some idiot users that run a node for fun. Who cares. Nodes will be run by companies and orgs that use bitcoin, there cost is not an issues. Users don't run bitcoin nodes because there is no value in doing so. Again if bitcoin cares about decentralization they have to solve the mining. That said you can still run a bitcoin node at home (I have one, today i tested something with it)
But lets have a dialog and maybe u can show me where i am wrong: explain to me how nodes create decentralization? Especially when miners are centralized/compromised. I am here to learn.

I just think a settlement layer is senseless as any currency application is also a settlement layer.
So if Bitcoin wants to be a settlement layer we are basically just saying to simply not use it.
I.e. If we were to use ethereum to do all transactions but then were to use Bitcoin as settlement layer, what would be the point of exchanging larger amount of value from ethereum to Bitcoin to settle when I can settle in ethereum already, much quicker and without the cost of moving into a different value system.
Bitcoin as a settlement layer is useless, unless it is the only game in town.

So nodes can act stupid and be rejected off the network yes.
Miners do not need other nodes. What you call nodes are just 1/2 nodes as in miners that don't mine and only do the propagation. 
Nodes can also not just reject blocks without forking themselves. So what you are describing has nothing to do with nodes (that don't mine) but with how the general consensus works. In order for the network to be healthy there needs to be miners (which are also nodes). If you have miners you automatically have nodes. Nodes that do not mine are not very useful, other than helping other nodes out by providing information. The notion of the decentralization of bitcoin depends on nodes is simply FUD to distract from the real challenge bitcoin is facing due to the fact that we are run by a handful of dudes at this point who can exercise complete control over the network if they chose to (or if they would be corrupted).
The main purpose of running a node is the verification for the node itself. So if you want to be sure about btc tx its best to run a node yourself. I.e. as a business working in bitcoin it makes sense to run a node.

The governance mode of Bitcoin is: whatever the majority accepts are the rules. Consequently if you don't like this model you can change these rules by getting a majority of users behinds you.
I personally like this as I think it is important that the community has the ability to adapt the protocol.
If one or a handful of miners have 51% of the hash power than Bitcoin is not decentralized anymore and we have a whole different problem to deal with. 
This is the case right now, Bitcoin is dominated by a handful of miners and onle implementation and as such de-facto not decentralized. It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin will be able to adjust to this or will be taken over by a different implementation.

First off we are talking 3 to per second at the moment.
Also you did not actually go into where decentralization is coming from and why we are not decentralized.
Third you are talking about nodes, which are irrelevant for decentralization, as the network is run by miners.
Everyone that is running the Bitcoin network today needs millions in order to participate in mining. so for these guys, having internet or HD spec is simply not a problem or cost factor.
But certainly a blocksize limit restricts transaction volume, while it has only indirect impact on the cost of mining and even running nodes. But really when it comes to decentralization only miners matter. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:33:19
SegWit is a protocol upgrade. By removing the signature from the consensus we can create more dynamic script update and innovations  on top of bitcoin.
It does not solve the issue that has been created via the blocksize. As such it also does not compete with BU. And vice versa. BU does nothing that SegWit does. So one should not consider them competition and look at this either or.
SegWit in my book is insanely amazing innovation that we should activate (though it can never work in the current form as SF with 95% activation)

@_date: 2016-01-21 16:18:01
Miners are supposed to decide how big a block is. Miners would balance adding transactions vs increased orphaned risk but with the limit this aspect is skewed.
So yes it fucks up the economics of mining and Bitcoin entirely in addition to fucking up its functionality (1-2 tx/s) and making Bitcoin centralized which fucks it up even more.
It was implemented to fight of dos attacks. It should be changed in a way that it does not impact the core functionality and economics of Bitcoin while preventing dos attacks.
The simple solution is a dynamic limit relative to the avg blocksize of immediate past, just like bitpay suggested.
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:55:52
thank you for your thorough answer.
In Bitcoin decentralization is what creates security. As such decentralization is a very important part of Bitcoin. It's not something that is done for fun or just because we can. It is for the most basic foundation of the system it's security.
As a result decentralization actually matters, but dones (non mining) do not really add decentralization effect. As a result I find the term is exploited for political agendas. Which is why I wanted to see if there is some actual merit behind it.
Running nodes has tons of value. I have run nodes myself. I don't see how Bitcoin runs on more computer when there are modes. As running is really performed by the miners. But I can see how this is not a digital thing but more grey, since nodes also provide services such as relaying tx, blocks and answering network request from other nodes.
So yes I see how they are contributing a tiny bit to decentralization. Yet it is so small that it to me is negligible.
I personally am very worried about decentralization in Bitcoin and I think bitcoin is very vulnerable at this point due to its centralization. I also believe that the trend is to more centralization and that core is in support of this. This worries me a lot.
There are many ways Bitcoin could be more decentralized, but making nodes more decentralized looks to be distraction strategy to a topic that is irrelevant from a decentralization perspective.

A Node is just a sub-part of what a miner is. So it does not provide urility beyond what a miner provides. As such it is just not relevant (except for personal value to the node operator, which is obviously huge). Nodes also do not protect feom regulation or provide freedom as they do not really contribute to the network, so again this provided by the mining (nodes)
It does provide security that the network is running correctly since anyone can validate anything.

@_date: 2017-03-16 03:37:35
All the actions of core speak the opposite to me.
But it really is irrelevant because if bitcoin fails others will take over. Bitcoin already has lost 1/2 of its weight in my portfolio, due to the rise of all the other projects.
This is the beauty as an investor. I am just said to see how progress of bitcoin is hindered by the miners and core developers. I really perceive it opposite to you all the actions the core team is executing show to me a sign of incompetence or sabotage. I.e issuing segwit as softfork with 95% activation. You can only do this if you want segwit not activate and years of work go down the drain. Just one example.
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:05:12
a block size of 10gb is not realistic because it would not propagate in time.
The reason why people cannot sync the blockchain is not because it is too hard to download 1 block, but because we need to download all blocks.
A minor on the other does not really care about the blockchain because he has to invest millions into a data center and mining hw anyhow.
a node is not incentivised so fewer want to run nodes, unless there is a strong business reason value. If the size of the blockchain is a challange than it does not matter much wether we are talking 1MB or 0.1MB or 5MB because we have to store so many blocks its huge data.
again other design decision are responsible.
Yes block size has an impact, but it's not relevant. 
if we actually care about decentralization, why are we not talking and changing what matters to decentralization.

Again this all fine, well and true for any digital/crypto currency and the overall utility of blockchain is not in question, however why decide to limit its use. So if you decide to have two currencies, one that is used for day to day cash use and one by elite groups that make only large volume transaction. What is the value of having the latter and how would you separate the two?
So tbh you are not answering my question, but telling me to shut up. But let me take your argument seriously anyway. By limiting the amount of transaction volume you are essentially limiting the efficiency of bitcoin. So how is that useful and increasing its value/utility.

How exactly is running a node helpful? How is it decentralizing?
You cannot decentralize Bitcoin by running nodes. How does 200 or 500 or 5000 create more decentralization? It does not. Having 20 or 100 miners, now that makes a difference (notice we have 20 of which 4 have a majority).
If decentralization would be a concern, mining had to be addressed. You can't fix a 51% attack with nodes. 
It's just part of the FUD and BS. the consensus works very simply and clearly. It's up to the miners and the market. Nodes are not part of this.
@_date: 2016-01-02 03:08:04
Why would that even matter. Softfork or hardfork is irrelevant from the protocols perspective.
@_date: 2016-01-17 03:32:48
1. this is a general problem. independent of blocksize and is called selfish mining
2. it is a problem when few miners are really big (close 50%) otherwise holding back blocks has the risk of others mining new blocks and cause orphants and loss of mining rewards.


The point is there are decentralization issues with bitcoin that should be tackled, but block size only limits sclability

Blocksize has 0 influence on mining. Miners set their own blocksize and will deal with any other blocksize.
If you can invest millions in a data center and win a global race to be one of a handful of miners u will manage to download 1MB or 10mb or whatever it is from the Internet

right. small blocks leads to centralization which leads to bitcoin being obsolete. this is why this bip would solve the problem and let the network adjust to what it thinks the right block size would be.

The size is only one part of the equation. It's a balance of size and tx price.
There always is a fee market, as miners will only include transactions that are profitable for them.
If there were no block reward nobody would transact today with a 1mb block limit if prices were to replace block rewards or no miners would mine anymore if tx fees would not change.
In reality we would need no blocksize limit and then miners and users would come to an equilibrium via market forces.
Of course with the 1mb limit we have today and no reward we would likely just lose miners and users unless we find off chain solutions quickly.
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:05:07
I suggest you read the whitepaper. Nodes most certainly do not define the consensus. They merely verify tx and blocks for their own benefit.
Nodes don't write blocks, hence are not part of consensus. Nodes are also irrelevant for decentralization of bitcoin, they merely provide some bandwidth help for other nodes. If nodes were the consensus then one could be part of the consensus for free which would defeat the entire consensus goal of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:57:12
It sounds to me you want everyone to be able to live. That does not work. This world you live in by design works in a way that some things are better than others and therefore have a right to survive while others will be dominated. The "let everybody live" thing is fundamentally unnatural and requires heavy intervention. So it seems you dis-like the freedom capitalism provides and favor a human managed rule system, i.e. Who deserves how much value etc.
This however produces an overall less competitive society and will therefore be dominated by a society that is more capitalistic because that economic freedom will be better and this by the law of life provides the right to dominate.

this likely won't work in the US, as US CC don't allow for that AFIK.
You can use bitwala for US accounts as well, but they charge $20. There really is not a good way to wire money in the US without fees. You practically cannot sent money in the US unless you use a check, as in a piece of paper that you sign with a pen and send via mail.
I live in the US and have a coinbase account so selling is easy that way. However sending to a different account i would have no idea how to do that with btc. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:10:50
Ummm someone providing hashing power to a pool is not a miner. The pool = the miner. Just like a CPU is not a computer.
There are about 20 miners today, and 3-5 of them have a majority.
Hence bitcoins centralization issue. You can have 1 millions nodes and Bitcoin is still centralized. And again they don't really matter.
To speak about providing decentralization via nodes is just mis-understanding how Bitcoin works or deflecting from the actual issue Bitcoin has.
@_date: 2016-03-09 23:46:07


again, few miners poses risk. few nodes do not. The purpose of nodes is to do verification for the individual. So if you want to be sure, run a node. However for network security mining is matters. If you want the network to be secure you need many decentralized miners.
The current focus on nodes is either a distraction from the real problems bitcoin is facing or demonstrates mis-understanding of how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:59:12
Looks like the core strategy is working out
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:49:33
Sorry but for many this might also be the safest way. For me for example I would not want to store it on my computer or hw wallet since either can be, either broken into or stolen and I do not want to setup security to deal with cold wallets. 
When you store Bitcoin on coinbase you are outsourcing the security of your coin. You give up control, but having them secure is much easier than if you do it yourself.
So what I am simply saying is that the best and worse way is a relative term and for 99% of people coinbase will be the safest and best way to store bitcoins.

If you keep your cash in your pocket, you need to be able to defend yourself vs theft.
When you keep your private keys yourself the same thing holds true. For me keeping my keys with coinbase secured by 2FA is certainly safer than on my phone alone or on my PC unless I change the way I handle that security.
Security in this sense is relative. The power of Bitcoin is that people now have a choice to outsource the security or in source it. This is why Bitcoin is powerful. The fact that many people will leverage banking tech with Bitcoin is not a bad thing, but mis-understood by many in the community.
@_date: 2016-01-28 00:52:07

It is true, when running a node you increase decentralization, it is just an insignificant aspect that is more decentralized.
The nodes are simply an insignificant part of the Bitcoin network in the sense that they do not provide value to the network, instead provide value to the individual (which does have a feedback loop for the network).
I find that there is a big risk in Bitcoin of centralization. This centralization is supported by what I would call the small blockers, as they seem to be looking to centralize more and more aspects of it (who gets to use Bitcoin, who gets to develop etc). At the same time I find them arguing for decentralization in an aspect that is already super decentralized and irrelevant. I wonder if Bitcoin will come out of this or if it will be taken over as a result of it and what will happen if the value of the network grows and as a result increases centralization.
Thank you so much for your valuable dialog. I have learned so much from you and the way you presented your thoughts.

I think the success of storj is questionable.
I don't see real front end innovation for users at this point. In fact this is another Bitcoin project that fails to address usability. The only key advantage at this point is price, and with that it might be hard to be profitable as a farmer.
So as a farmer you need two things to be successful:
1. Storj needs to succeed and get many customers.
2. You need to have significant advantage over other farmers, else the market will create an equilibrium at which u won't be able to be profitable
As such it seems to me this is not a good place to put your money as an investment.
I personally invested in the crowdfunding and I farmed a bit in the testing phases. Just for fun. I love the project and its potential.

first of bitcoin kinda does not work as money (i.e. check nash on ideal money) it might be asymptotically ideal, but that would require heavy changes to the protocol with focus on value vs supply.
the key thing bitcoin does and is meant to do is to allow p2p transactions. digital cash. transactions without 3rd parties. changing its purpose as being a settlement layer changes the basic functionality of it. I also don't think bitcoin can be a good settlement system as transactions between 3rd parties are much more efficient transacting directly. So again if we take away the capability to transact p2p then we cut away the key functionality or value of bitcoin.
The value of bitcoin comes only from its utility, limiting tx is limiting the utility. Security issues also limits this utility and creating a settlement layer also creates security risk thru centralization. large blocks however do not create centralization and allow higher tx and p2p functionality.
we can already transact via settlement system. Any existing money uses a settlement system as soon as u stop using cash. Given bitcoins weakness as money the question would remain: what is the value as settlement system?
 
@_date: 2016-01-07 05:03:40
Destroying value is not a good way to grow an economy. Paying for things in btc when it's more expensive is not helpful to the individual and neither for Bitcoin. 
There is really no harm in offering Bitcoin payments but I just don't see how this is critical for Bitcoin growth.  I think it works the other way around: once the Bitcoin market has grown companies will offer it as payment. 
First we need to find applications that make Bitcoin useful and valuable. Paying for stuff with Bitcoin at this point is usually not helpful.
I personally rather keep my bitcoins, with the exception of Starbucks and Amazon: there I always pay with Bitcoin because it saves me 20-30%, as such in cool with handing coinbase 1% when moving usd to btc. I'm not going to do this even if possible for services where I can pay the same price with my cc or via btc. My Cc gives me 1-2% in rewards while I will pay 1-3% in exchange rate and fees to use btc.

I think the concentration of miners in china is less of an issue as the concentration of hashing power with few miners.
Bitcoin by design will lead to mining centralization, which i think is a general flaw in its design, because the security of bitcoin is based on de-centralization.

Bitcoin is really simple:
1. It allows p2p money transfer, so u can send anyone money without any other 3rd party
2. It does this by having a public record of transactions (block chain) that no single entity owns and controls and every participant in the network (node) has a copy of that is constantly kept in sync
3. The record and anything else such as protocol rules are run and governed by a consensus mechanism. In Bitcoin this consensus mechanism is called proof of work and updating the record is called mining.

right because calling people names Makes so much sense. Along with claiming one can write pages of logical arguments and then just saying nothing of use.
It is fundamentally illogical to claim something is good for centralization by restricting who or how many people can use it, when there is no technical or natural limit. That's what block size limit is. It makes only sense if you want few people controlling Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-26 04:46:52
Lolz then why are his actions increasing and protecting centralization? literally nothing core is proposing helps to increase decentralization.
Hitler received a nobel price while prepping for war.
If decentralization mattered, why are we not even talking about miner centralization? Literally a handful of miners/pools have control over bitcoin. 
If decentralization mattered why are we not increasing the blocksize?
It does not add up.
I do admire Maxes ability to control bitcoin the way he does, however the above statement is pure bs.
@_date: 2016-06-26 04:05:28
The point is fb is successful because it does not have id. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:24:38
Again, that point is completely moot and void. Blocks propagate practically instantly, if not than there is a natural market that evolves the equilibrium of the blocksize. Either way the argument shows a lack of understanding over most basic mechanics of bitcoin. Small blocks cause centralization and cap the utility value of bitcoin. Blocksize is also the worst way to approach centralization issue of bitcoin, so folks that use this argument are either manipulating you or logically confused.

Well weather something is good or bad depends on the perspective. So it depends.
I am going to look at this from the perspective of everybody that uses a currency as a whole or from the perpspective of ideal money.
So from that perspective the money needs to be:
- fair in the sense that everyone is treated equally
- facilitate transactions &amp; make it easy to transfer value
- store value and maintain value
Deflationary money is:
- not fair, as holders of the currency have an advantage. Money is re-distributed from poor to rich.
- the deflationary attribute has no significant impact on the transfer of value
- deflation changes the value of money and as such makes it bad in the sense of storing value.
Similarly inflationary money:
- redistributes value from poor to rich
- changes value over time and makes it a bad store of value
Of course there might be different ways of looking at it like if the goal is to benefit certain groups or have other objectives.
@_date: 2016-01-21 09:30:08
A bunch of blabla and lots of false statements.
Governance in Bitcoin is pretty simple: whatever the majority accepts is the protocol. Everyone can decide to accept these rules or not. Thereby one is part of the network or not. That's it.
As such a hard or soft fork is really the same thing in the end.
What matters are the overal rules of the protocol.

Also if a judge would look at the DAO he would likely interpret the action of the hacker as stealing and not in the intend of the law anyway, so i think there is little to worry about actually.
What seems mich more interesting is how the eth community reacts to this and how effective thw consensus mechanism of that community is.
@_date: 2016-06-05 23:30:24
Nono. A system that is based upon de-centralization and who's security is based on de-centralization is totally cool with 2-3 miners having a super majority.
Instead we should really be worried about keeping blocks limited so we can make sure bitcoin has artificially less utility the more people use it.
@_date: 2016-06-29 23:55:58

for the purpose of money the value needs to be stable, as transactions have two parties. If not stable Bitcoin is not good  for contracts or anything that is not instant. As such most things involving money cannot be denoted in Bitcoin.
Instead it makes it an investment vehicle, but not good money/currency.
@_date: 2017-01-28 18:50:20
Because this is just a game
@_date: 2017-01-29 01:21:56
No. Appreciation is just as bad as the opposite for the purpose of money/currency
Anytime value changes during a transaction it's really bad for one side of the transaction. As such money only works if it's stable. 
I.e. Imagine getting paid in a currency and the currency appreciates 100%. Awesome for the employee not so much for the employer. As such salary could not be described in such a currency.
The most important aspect of money is stability.

I love it people run nodes. Ive been running nodes myself.
@_date: 2016-06-07 15:48:36
1. Downloading 1 vs 2 MB should not take any real time relative to 10 min. If you can invest 100s of millions into your HW maybe you can afford an internet connection that's a bit faster than dial up.
2. Blocks don't need to propagate in order for you to mine them. You can start mining as soon as you know the hash and there are protocols to increase the efficiency such as thin blocks and various other solutions miners use.
3. Centralization of miners is certainly an issue in my book, but blocksize is not the root cause and practically irrelevant for it. Other design decision lead to miner centralization. De-centralization also seems to not matter to core, since pretty much nothing is being worked on to increase decentralization.

Yes selfish mining is a thing. Blocksize limit is still idiotic and leads to centralization, which is why it is pushed by block stream and big miners. However block size has primarily an impact on scaling not decentralization.
Why are u actually defending an arbitrary block limit. If ur arguments made sense the blocks use should be 0.
It's all fine. Bitcoin can be centralized as there are plenty of coins that won't be.

Unfortunatwly there is no free lunch and buying bitcoin is difficult.
The good news is that coinbase is the best place to be.
What you can do to buy bitcoins with no fee is to move money from your bank account into your coinbase wallet.
That will take a few days.
Once the money's in your wallet, move them into gdax. Gdax is the exchange from coinbase. Moving the funds is instant.
On gdax you can make a limit order that cost no fees.

Not really. Bitcoin is more of a rail or comodity as it cannot be used as currency (currency needs to be stable). What is missing are things that use the commodity or rail. An example is purse.io. However it might not qualify as killer app.
Compared to the internet we might have tcpip but arw missing www, email or chat.
Of course the analogy is not perfect but maybe you get the idea.

Nope. No nodes (non mining) has absolutely 0 effect on the network. Miners is what operates the network (they are also nodes).  Assuming from your remarks you have not read the whitepaper or bitcoin code. If you do you will see that satoshi assumes nodes=miners. 
As long as mining works everything is fine. If mining is somehow compromised non mining nodes cant do anything to fix it. All they can do is recognize that something is wrong.

To 1. Bitcoin is not controlled by coins but by hashing power. As such centralization has already occured. We might call 4-5 guys having conteol decentralized, however i think it might make it quite easy to corrupt bitcoin this way.
To your 2. Point. I agree it would not make sense to attack bitcoin economically other than to get most rewards. However there might be other motivations to destroy or hurt it, which is why decentralization matters. That said the bitcoin developers seem to not be very worried about it.

Well, i am confused. I have never read that "bitcoin should be a democracy" in r/btc or anywhere else. And i think the notion is silly since it is not a country and the only democracies I know if are countries, where bitcoin is clearly governed by miners and their hashing power.
@_date: 2016-11-14 02:01:19
You make assumptions that are false. Ver simply stated that the demand of bitcoin will decrease if tx fees rise, which is obviously true.
Deducting that he believes the demand for bitcoin cannot rise with tx fees is illogical.
The fact that some people will pay for higher tx fees does not mean high transaction fees are good.

"But for net worth, the 1 percent threshold for net worth in the Fed data was nearly $8.4 million, or 69 times the median household's net holdings of $121,000. Some readers wondered if the 1 percent by wealth weren't an entirely different group of people from the 1 percent by income."

Making 1% Ranks in U.S.
Who constitutes the 1% if you just look at the U.S.? Not surprisingly, it takes a massively higher income to crack the top percentile of wage earners: you’d have to make $450,000 in adjusted gross income (AGI) to make the cut.
And to rank amongst the highest 1% of Americans by wealth? That requires net assets of more than $7 million, based on the latest Federal Reserve figures.

When I signed up with coinbase I was able to buy Bitcoin instantly right from the first day by providing a U.S. Bank account and credit card. But I think it was limited how much I could buy instantly (maybe 100 usd). Now I can buy 1k instantly per week and 50k with a few days delay. They release the btc when they have the money.
Have both purchased big amounts with the delay and I constantly buy small amounts, ie when I buy somethin on Amazon via purse.

again in sticking with ideal money as nash describes it means its stable.
In order to be stable it would mean that the average person would spend the same amount of currency or the same thing at any time.
In order to do this you have to balance both side of the equation:
the size of everything that the currency represents  &amp; the currency supply.
Our fiat system is a bit designed this way, exept that instead of stability the goal is inflation at a certain speed (i.e. 2% right now) and this is managed by the fed which tries to adjust the money supply.
Bitcoin is deflationary in its design. however one could design a crypto currency differently. If we wanted ideal money i am saying we have to come up with a mathematical or programmatical way to ensure that both sides of the equation are balanced.

In a casino the real value would be to buy chips with btc since that would allow you to buy more than the limit of an atm. So today everyone uses cash or establishes credit with the casino.

You do not buy with cc. The cc is used as security in case there are issues with your bank account I believe. In other words if you only link your bank account buying will take some time, but if you add the cc you can buy instantly from day one.

Currency represents an economy on the one hand and has a supply on the other.

I don't understand the fuss about XT to be honest.
Bitcoin has a consensus mechanics which is whatever the majority wants and runs wins.
XT is simply using that mechanism. You can run the client or you cannot. You are casting a vote by running it or not. 
There is simply nothing wrong with this. If people agree with the XT implementation they will switch to it and it will become the new protocol and everyone else will have to adopt it or run a second bitcoin chain. We then have two coins instead of one. Also nothing wrong with that because its part of the design. (i don't like it but that does not mean its wrong).
Being on one side of the argument is one thing, saying that someone who is actually putting their solution up on the network to be bad or wrong is simply not understanding how the system works or wanting a less democratic approach.
Bitcoin is democratic, nobody gets to be the rules nazi but the consensus.
There are two developers that are using the design of bitcoin to bring changes they believe in. The nodes will decide if that is the right approach or not. And that's the way this things is designed to work.
If you don't like the design you can bring your version to the masses and see if they accept it. Just like Gavin and Mike have done.
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:50:06
Transactions are meaning full. It means Bitcoin is used more which is the most important aspect of its utility.
It will be more useful if value would increase as well.  However this is not insignificant. It also shows that usage and price are correlated.
@_date: 2015-07-04 08:39:57
that's a valid question. and i don't have the solution.
However if we want to create ideal money as in what nash described we have to design it with stable value on mind.
Stable value can only be attained if we look at both the usage as well as the money supply. Those are two parts of an equation that need to be balanced and so if one side increases the other side has to increase as well and vice versa.
I believe with bitcoin or the bc we have a basic technology where now thinking about such a solution is possible.
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:41:58

Yes, this is the only application I know of and use that can only be done with bitcoin.
Greece might show a 2nd one. However it is also telling that nobody in Greece sees Bitcoin as solution.
I have been saving 20-30% of all Amazon purchases the last year or so. 
To me purse is a great example of bitcoins potential. But we need truly useful application for end users. The Internet took really off when the iPhone came out. This shows how important making usable applications that put value to the end users is for Bitcoin. I feel that we are still in a geeky state and need to be a bit more patient. 
Analogous to the Internet we don't even have email, browsers or chat yet invented.

The money supply and also the problem of how to onboard:
- you need massive size for currency to work, which means value must move into it
- volatility is a great attracting force for traders
- deflation is attractive for investors 
Ie Bitcoin is designed to be very volatile in the beginning and later deflationary. As such it should attract value of different people at different stages of its lifecycle. All with the purpose of getting value to move into it.
Only problem is that makes for bad currency. But how else are you going to move value into without actually having that value or power over people.
Some think volatility is misunderstood by many.
But this also means Bitcoin is not a good currency as the store of value aspect does not work until the market cap is very high.
@_date: 2016-02-16 06:38:04

In order for Bitcoin to truly work as a currency it must have stable value else it's not really a currency.

"ideal" in the sense of nash the current system is more ideal, even though me or you might personally prefer bitcoin over fiat. However we must understand why bitcoin is unsuitable as currency in general until it is more stable.
Few people understand what "ideal" money is, so I understand why many people might be confused.
In essence good currency must be stable and PPM is design unstable forever due to the fact that the supply is fixed.

Correct. A blocksize limit makes no sense economically and technically.
A fee market is there automatically and does not need to be created.
A blocksize is just capping the utility of Bitcoin artificially.
The blocksize makes only sense as protection against attacks, however that would be solved by a dynamic blocksize relative to recent past.
The arguments for a blocksize are imho simply political power games and destructive to Bitcoin overall.
IMHO I am not worried though if the consensus does not elevate the ideal protocol; other protocols will be able to take over Bitcoin. As such this is very interesting dialog and evolution happening  to Bitcoin and part of the experiment. It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin will evolve or will be replaced.

So you just explain how many nodes could attack the network. The community always urges many nodes are important and key to decentralization.
It seems to me that many miners is more important. Having many nodes instead of many miners seems to be a work around that does not seem to work to keep the decentralization up and also not a safe way to keep decentralized

Ideal money is stable money.

They can't. Miners don't exploit blocksize. Only attackers could but only if it were unlimited and nodes were stupid.
In other world blocksize limit is just a very stupid rule that fucks up the ecosystem.

Coinbase is a us company and gambling is protected here by very powerful gambling lobby.
This lobby operates via banking laws to which coinbase has to submit.
So never send funds to and from coinbase to any gambling site. Instead sent it to your personal wallet and then to the gambling site.
Brian just made a public bet which is something presidential candidates have done even though it is technically illegal. It has nothing to with coinbase though.

@_date: 2016-02-25 01:45:54
There is no benefit in higher fee market.
Fees are overhead and cost. You don't want to artificially create it.
Miners create a few market automatically and via market forces. The block size just screws this market up. 
It's like regulation that does nothing for the ecosystem. 
So people who call for a few market do simply not understand Bitcoin, else they knew that the fee market was already there. Or are lying about the fact that they want to manipulate the fee market.

If you believe Bitcoin will be worth 0 or 1-5M per coin than those 50k should yield either  150+ - 1B. 
Do you believe in the 0 or everything idea of the Bitcoin price?  And again what are you trying to accomplish?
@_date: 2016-02-22 17:23:21
Tbh I think the volatility is so volatile that we should not read too much into it.
Bitcoin is very volatile and will be for a long long time.
We still have 20% fluctuations in a day some time.

The purpose of blockllimit is not decentralization quite the opposite it creates centralization. There is nothing that a bigger block does against decentralization. Bitcoin has a decentralization problem but nobody seems to actually care about it or proposes solutions for that issue.
Core wants Bitcoin to be more centralized. Centralized miners and centralized development and centralized payment providers on top of Bitcoin. This is what block size limits creates. Core is not stupid so they understand this. I think this is ok for a team to do, but for Bitcoin overall decentralization increased security and utility.
@_date: 2016-02-10 07:02:00
I think Bitcoin the tech will likely (95%)become dominant. How I am sure I am incapable of imagine. He who will will become very rich.
Bitcoin itself I'm not so sure. It has many design flaws and cannot work as a currency very well.
Because of the above I have significant value in it, more than any other asset class at the moment. But I am ready to exist any time and jump on the next trend and am slightly diversified ca 70% of crypto in btc.
I don't think Bitcoin in its form can survive unless it adapts significantly, as in turns from a worm into a butterfly.
I also do not think Bitcoin and usd ( all other fiat) can coexist so 5k per coin in 2020 seems unlikely, it has to grow much faster.
I think we are talking millions or nothing.
@_date: 2016-02-12 05:37:38

Why would the price tank?
A hard fork is nothing special and practically not different from any othe software update: it's a simple adaption of the protocol. We have also had a few of these in the past.
On the other hand if Bitcoin fails to be able to adapt and form consensus than it would likely resort to being worthless and being taken over.
Currently Bitcoin is tried to be centrally controlled and become more and more centralized. The inability to adjust the blocksize is a symptom of this ( it results from the centralization of miners and Dev team)
The good news is that if Bitcoin fails there will be other bitcoins that will simply take over.
@_date: 2016-02-08 01:08:54
In my eyes they are. The blocksize is in my eyes a design flaw similar to a functional bug that absolutely poses an easistantial risk to Bitcoin.  It creates centralization and makes Bitcoin unusable. I understand there are some that believe otherwise.
Also hard forks only affects nodes, which are not even users but only servers/operators of the network and as such should be on top enough to understand when they have to upgrade.
So there is practically no risk to Bitcoin other than the new version having. 
I understand there are folks that have very different opinions including so called experts and Bitcoin gods.
I will be happy to hear arguments and have dialog about this and learn where my thoughts are wrong.

It took the Internet 20 years.
And Bitcoin is a crappy currency and has no valuable applications at this time. The Internet had emails, chatting and websites. All things that were not possible without it. There is literally nothing that consumers care about that bitcoin provides that can't be done without it and is valuable.
So right now it's just a technical foundation.
Bitcoin is like the printing press but newspapers have yet to be invented

@_date: 2016-02-22 05:13:07
I think the challenge right now is that it is not usable as store of value. As such the currency application is limited.
We do need a killer app. But it might be useful as payment vehicle and if bigger the value might become more stable.
I think we will need a crypto with stable value eventually.
@_date: 2017-04-14 05:21:52
Coinbas is the nutz.
@_date: 2016-02-26 18:41:57
The only way you can have stable money is by adjusting the money supply in a way that value stays stable. Ie increase supply if value goes up and decrease if value goes down. The interesting part of Bitcoin is that due to the fact that it's a live system this is technically possible. Bitcoin can evolve and does not have to be replaced.
Of course we would also figure out how to measure this value first as well.
I think however with Bitcoin we have the tech to implement ideal money for the first time ever.
@_date: 2016-02-18 04:21:56
We already have this sepation.
The goals are in the white paper 
@_date: 2016-02-23 04:47:11
Well i disagree with you that coinbase is anti bitcoin or whatever u want to say there with anti-thetical.
It is simply the best wallet experience out there. Again some people might believe that holding the coins yourself is what bitcoin is all about but people like me actually like the fact that the security and administration can be properly outsourced.
There is nothing scarier for me than having my money on my computer ;-)
I simply have yet to find a wallet that works and has a decent user experience, or one that compares with coinbase.
I have used core, xt, electrum mycelium and blockchain and all are a pain. Coinbase is smooth simple and has an exchange and buying bitcoin instantly integrated. So for a normal users that just wants to either hold lots of bitcoin or get in and out quickly there is no better alternative.
You can also use the web without google... but im sure u do not, even thouh we all don't like to mined for data, or do we.
@_date: 2016-02-04 09:38:27

The blocks are full. That means not all new transaction will make it into the next block. Especially when ur tx fees are low.

It makes sense to use coinbase because they always pay for the tx fees and adjust them accordingly.

i am talking in the sense of ideal money (nash) or as for someone that lives in the real economy.
Bitcoin and fiat is the same side of the same coin (one is inflationary the other deflationary, which both has the same effect &gt; money reditribution to wealthy)
but the current system are much more "ideal" than bitcoin as they may adjust supply while bitcoin can't. So as such per definition it is not really usable as a curency.

Why do nodes even matter? Is the key to decentralization not miner decentralization?
What good are many nodes when miners are not decentralized?
If nodes were that important would they not be incentivized? All incentive is via the miners in Bitcoin and miners are the key part of Bitcoin that needs to be decentralized ?
Satoshi did not even talk about nodes in white paper other than miners. To ho him node=miner. 
It feels to me the community is so obsession with nodes so they can ignore the elephant in the room which is miner centralization?
@_date: 2016-02-11 07:33:13
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:00:38
You don't have to tell miners how large to make the blocks. They get rewarded for making that decision. Any artificial limit where some human decided how big it should be is just always wrong and bad as in not the proper size.
The miners naturally find the perfect size as they get financially rewarded for it.
A block will always have some limit too as there are costs and technical restrictions, so worrying about there not being a blocksize is again a simple show of a logical mistake.
Unfortunately even the brightest minds make these.
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:18:04
How would that happen?
@_date: 2015-07-04 02:59:39
I think any currency system designed by nations will be the current fiat system as this is what is in control right now.
If you want a different system I think we need a different political system first.
Bitcoin as a technology allows for innovation thru market and technological innovation for the first time. Better money can now be created via the market. However first a product has to be developed. It seems the Bitcoin currency has not shown to be able to compete very well in the market, as it is not much adopted. It seems to us that problems like in Greece could be solved by Bitcoin, however the market tells us otherwise.
What I think is interesting is that it is now possible to come up with alternatives via the market.
Once the market comes up with a solution is when things will change. I am not sure if Bitcoin the currency is it. I am confident that Bitcoin the technology provides the framework to build an alternative.
@_date: 2016-02-25 05:59:15
I don't quite understand your point. 
I don't think fees are bad. It cost something to mine a block and miners need incentives to include a transaction into blocks. I just don't see any value in messing with this market between miners and users that issue transactions. The market will come up with an equilibrium represented by a fee. A fee by human design will never be close to the equilibrium.

Claiming larger blocks create centralization is utterly idiotic. There are millions of things and design decisions that create centralization. A blocksize has been implemented to prevent attacks and has the design implication to limit the very most basic functionality of Bitcoin.
It also fucks up a natural fee market.
@_date: 2016-02-26 16:36:39


i am just saying bitcoin will never really be stable with the current design. So its simply not a good tool for value storage. i think to call this growing pain sounds like it is a defecty, but to me this is the way its supposed to be. I think this design has proven to be very effective in on boarding bitcoin overall.
Deflationary is not stable. Its the the other side of the same coin compared to inflation. The problem with inflation is that it re-distributes wealth from poor to rich. Bitcoin does this as much as fiat. In bitcoin people without assets/money lose value because the money of holders increases with inflation assets increase and the monthly income decreases. The effect is the exact same, although many things in the economy will work just the opposite. I.e. fiat will inflate assets, deflation would make assets cheaper and money more valuable. One encourages hoarding the other creation of debt. But both distort the economy. 
So i personally believe that bitcoin will either evolve into a more "ideal" form of money according to nash, ie. its possible that bitcoin is asymptotically ideal, but this would require drastically protocol changes. Or we will create a currency that is more ideal using bitcoin/blockchain tech. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 16:21:42
tbh. i think decentralization bitcoin is the most important thing.
But not into every layer. The closer we are to the core of the system the more important decentralization is. At the same time decisions must be possible in an efficient manner.
As such such it is actually useful to have centralized decision makers to create a software development project so long as the result is open source and people can contribute.
What is bad however is a centralized software that dominates like core does. So having another client is great. the fact that it gets attacked soooo much is a sign that core is trying to dominate bitcoin and a very big red flag for me.
that said BU has issues and i dont like the BU consensus. I would prefer something much simpler that lets miners vote.

@_date: 2016-02-26 00:10:27
There is no technical reason for a blocksize limit aside from preventing attacks. If you remove blocksize limit this does not force miners to create blocks of huge size.
Also the blocksize also has no impact on decentralization, which is a problem that is created by other design decisions.
Ie. When Bitcoin had no blocksize limit the blocks were rather small actually 
@_date: 2016-02-25 06:12:07
I am sorry I deviated from the topic of your post.
I dont quite understand all of it, but it seems very interesting. How don't determine who mines the parallel blocks?
@_date: 2016-09-13 20:06:57
Nope. There are protocols that solve this issue.
Also if there were a significant lag it would create an natural block size limit.

There are several protocols that are released and being used and miners also have protocols between each other.
So the delay described above does not exist. U can see this anytime a block with 0 tx is being mined. This happens when a miner knows the previous hash, without having all the tx yet.
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:13:25

I think there is nothing wrong with an individual entity using a blockchain to perform a function.
Anyone using the technology and creating value with it just legitimizes Bitcoin.
I don't see this as an attack on Bitcoin but simply a way of leveraging its technology.
Bitcoin is also a technology that simply can be used. There is no moral or philosophical right way to use it. It's just a tech. The more it's beeing used and leveraged the better.

I agree with you that deflation is not as bad as people make it out to be. I might personally prefere it over an inflationary system. This topic is about ideal money and in that regard deflation is like inflation, not ideal. This is because both inflation and deflation move value which is opposite of what the purpose of  money is.
@_date: 2015-09-15 05:06:21
Umm why's your issue? 
@_date: 2015-04-03 03:55:34
Well money is different from an asset. So if we assume that all the USD today is worth 100 t the btc can only be worth 100t if the usd value goes towards 0.
Since fiat is inflationary and btc is deflationary it would not make sense for people to stay with fiat and hence I predict a swap of value from fiat to a btc type currency.
And again it would be fairly easy to collapse fiat by moving value from fiat to btc. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:55:07
So what do you mean by digital gold?
Do you mean an investment vehicle to store value?
Restricting the value of Bitcoin the way satoshi did by restrictin block size simply decreases its utility and makes it more centralized.
When u can only have a handful of entities transact on it with huge transactions then why would anyone use it?
@_date: 2015-09-14 04:10:18

bitcoin being a settlement layer only is i think against the original vision of creating a p2p digital cash system.
If user of btc need to go to a bank or 3rd party to make payments we might as well stick to fiat.
that does not mean btc cannot have value as settlement layer only per se. i just think there is not much value in settlement alone as any digital cash automatically also is a settlement system. I.e. if a crypto has the same security and and infrastructure as btc but can be transacted cheaper then bitcoins value should tend towards 0 in my book.
i.e. if either or nxt survives why would we need bitcoin, or even ltc?
@_date: 2016-10-13 14:30:40

@_date: 2015-09-29 04:41:13
You misunderstand what money measures.
Arguing for stable money supply to attain stability is like arguing that the amount of measuring sticks should be constant.  The measuring stick supply has nothing to do with how long the meter is.
Likewise the money supply is not relevant but the value of a currency unit is. You want the value to be stable, neither inflating nor deflating. Like pokertravis explained.
The money supply has an impact on the value of the currency which is where the confusing is coming from. But stable money supply does not create stable value because we need a balance of money supply with the economy. Both must shrink and or increase in tandem in order for the value to be stable.

the best thing would be to have a few dev teams compete with each other. So if 2x wins core should simply adopt 2x and move on. If not the 2x team should adopt core into their implementation (which they are doing so far).
So in general bitching about other def teams and even forks is counter productive. Bitcoin is stronger when decentralized, that includes dev teams and wallet implementations.

So your definition is in line with Keynesian and thus fiat money would be good money and Bitcoin really bad.
@_date: 2016-10-28 07:30:58
Again, you misunderstand the design of bitcoin. There is nothing a node can do that a miners does not. Nodes can't operate the network, miners do.
And yes ultimately the economic majority drives everything, however very indirectly.  Miners are being ignored simply because they are centralized and are the big elephant in the room that nobody wants to mess with.
If we can't even fork to change the blocksize how would we even fork away miners. Instead of measuring the decentralization of bitcoin by things that don't have any power or impact on the network we need to decentralize mining and then all problems are solved.

The stability of of fiat has not do with current events but with design.
Fiat systems are also not stable. Your implication is wrong.
I am simply stating that Bitcoin is not designed as money, I think because it is designed to not be stable, which is the most important aspect of money.
It seems that most bitcoiners do not understand what money is, while most non Bitcoin users have an intrinsic understanding of it, which is kind of funny.
But Bitcoin and fiat work the same way just opposite (inflation vs deflation) which is the same thing from a stability perspective.
Fiat at least has some way to adjust while Bitcoin does not.

@_date: 2016-10-30 20:27:18
your conclusion is not correct in that i am fine with option 2. Bitcoins security is independent of nodes, all that matters are many miners. The status today is not satisfactory to me, where we have 3-5 miners that matter and 5k nodes. The 5 k nodes provide no security to me. Not more than Reddit or the New York Times does.
Anyone with money or any government could come today and take control of key miners and severely disrupt Bitcoin, maybe not kill it. Agree we are probably rooting for the same thing here. Appreciate your dialog.
Again I dont mind people verifiyimg each tx and running full nodes. I do mind saying this makes Bitcoin secure.

This is wrongn. Inflation is due to increase in money supply. It is irrelevant if the coins are sold or not. If the price does not decrease by the inflation rate it means value is flowing into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-27 17:28:06
No. transaction fees are determine due by a market. All the blocksize does is screw up that market.
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:44:21
Deflation is the opposite of inflation but just the other side of the same coin.
Deflation is just as bad as inflation.

Nodes dont matter. What matters is miners. Miners are already centralized and can be corrupted by governments very easily. If u are worried about centralization dea with that. 
Blocksize has also nothing to do with how hard it is to run a node. This is a design decition to keep all data forever and have everyone confirm everything.
So using blocksize to manage all these things you speak about is just wrong.
Blocksize is simply stupid. It creates centralization and fucks up the core functionality of bitcoin. It was created against attacks, but now has created the opportunity for attacks. Its really funny. defendkng the blocksize is like cheering for hitlers economic revolution. It shows misunderstanding of fundamental workings of bitcoin. Blocksize limit is not a vehicle for decentralization in fact just the opposit. Just like hitler destroyed germans ecology. 
It just makes no sense that some dude decides that 1mb is the perfect blocksize. Even if satoahi did it.

prove that bitcoin can be a store of value
@_date: 2016-10-28 07:27:09
why would an individual run a node? 
A business might run a node, because it wants to query the network or blockchain. Examples are coinbase, bitpay, blockchain, 21 etc.
@_date: 2016-10-08 00:51:19
You can't do that with Bitcoin, you would need to create a different token that a debt issues can create.
@_date: 2016-10-13 18:43:21
store of value requires stable value. bitcoin is designed to be unstable.
@_date: 2016-10-29 05:41:51
So folks here on btc are so single minded. Just because core does not want to increase the blocksize does not mean that everything else they is bad. Segwit is clearly amazing. It makes the blockchain a bit more efficient but especially allows for more features to be added to bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-13 18:39:04
I understand your argument. However gold used to be money and i think derives it's value from historical tradition.
Bitcoin could like gold become something scarce but the difference between gold and bitcoin is that bitcoin is just a tech that can be copied and improved. I don't think bitcoin can do what gold did. I know lots of people think it is a digital version of gold though.

Again, there is nothing in Bitcoin that would suggest stability. Your question is like asking to prove why a cow can't fly.
It is not made to fly.
It is up to you to prove that Bitcoin could be stable. Without stability it is not very useful as money.
@_date: 2016-10-16 19:30:07
i think comparing fiat to crypto is the wrong approach. It is like comparing a company to a kingdom. The question is not to compare the two but to create a new form of money that works.
@_date: 2016-10-16 19:19:09


UMM no. like i said your assumption are wrong. 
All i was saying is that bitcoin has not been designed in a way that it can be stable. As such it cannot work as money. The unstable value creates friction and cost that make it inefficient to use as money.
@_date: 2016-10-30 19:59:34
Yes you are right, if you do not want to rely on any 3rd party you have to run a node.ive said before that this may make sense for a company to do. As a person I would not see it this way. If there are a few blockchain explorer I will be fine. Again I think this is what some people believe that everyone should run full nodes, but that just makes no sense to me, it is useless and expensive. 
The point is I need to trust that Bitcoin works. If Bitcoin works my spv node can receive Bitcoin and see anything I need to see, or I can use some other service that lets me control my keys and be fully in control.
However when the mining is centralized then there is a problem.
Also Bitcoin is not centralized when there are few nodes. Bitcoin is only centralized when there are few miners. Miners are also nodes but we do not need nodes that do not mine. This is the grand propaganda that has been propagated and is simply a distraction from the actual centralization issue we should be dealing with.
I agree with your point of the POW. The POW is at the core here. Not the nodes. The key thing is that the pow works in decentralized manner, else bitcoin is not save.
The main thing to me is your statements are they kinda correct, however not relevant because your last statement is wrong. There is nothing wrong with nodes of course, however we should not focus on making nodes easy to run for users as a main priority, especially when we use it to cap the utility for users.
That said, thank you for having a true dialog.

No, it makes the rich wealthier and the poor poorer. Bitcoin is designed to transfer wealth from poor to rich (maybe that was not the intend but it is still the design).
When coins gain value, the ones with many coins gain much and the ones with few coins gain little, hence transfer from poor to rich.

@_date: 2015-11-07 00:13:11
Obviously the folks that like small blocks don't like adoption so banning coinbase, which seems a big reason for adoption seems perfectly aligned with what they are trying to accomplish.
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:45:50
The wealth distribution is by design of our financial system. Bitcoin also is by design a system that distributes wealth from poor to rich.
Our current financial system creates the wealth re-allocation from poor to rich via two attributes: interest and inflation. Any money in our current system is created by the issuance of debt and any bank can create money via new debt. new debt always has interest and always increases the money supply. taking wealth away from the entity that receives the funds (interest) and the economy as a whole (inflation). Inflation happens autmatically since existing debt can only be paid with new debt and as such money supply has to increase over time or the system would collapse. people with wealth will as such move into asset which will increase over time with inflation. As such our system allows people with wealth to not suffer from inflation. People who live paycheck to paycheck or do not hold assets but cash will have reduced income over time and cannot escape inflation.  
Bitcoin works similarly but opposite. Bitcoin is deflationary so automatically people that hold more of it will gain value from people that hold less of it. People who receive pay in bitcoin would receive less coins over time and the coins of wealthy holders would gain in value.
Both deflation and inflation are two sides of the same coin: they shift wealth from poor to rich (beyond what nature does via giving us different abilities)
If you want a monetary system that does not do this we need "ideal money", an idea that Nash kicked off with his paper ideal money. Ideal money is essentially money that is stable in value (neither inflationary or deflationary).
Bitcoin gives us the technology to create ideal money. But the currency BTC is not "ideal" in that sense. Its far worse than fiat actually in that the wealth distribution would be much higher.

Again your statement is logically inconsistent. There is nothing in the design of bitcoin that makes nodes the police of bitcoin. That is what miners do. What you describe is a normal way change can happen in bitcoin. If the above would be an attack, nodes can't really help. It is again about the miners. As an example today it would be really easy for a government to corrupt a handful of miners and control the network and do that 75% attack you describe. That is a problem. And nodes can't help other than detect this and reject blocks etc. But what then? There will be a fork and the minority will run with the remaining miners. And again it is not about the nodes but the miners.
 Nodes have no incentive to exist, except for people to see all transactions and verify them for themselves. But they do not provide functionality to the network and get no rewards to exist.If they would be important than they would need to be a reward. Bitcoin runs on game theory.
It makes sense a business to run a node or if you want to (i.e. coinbase or blockchain.info). But there is absolutely no incentive or reason for a user to run a node.
If miners are not decentralized, bitcoin is not decentralized. The fact that you accept that miners can be corrupted shows a misunderstanding of how bitcoin is designed. Strength of bitcoin would come from security of miners and that not a handful of people get control over the network. Block-size has no impact on that.
Ignoring this and focusing on nodes is avoiding the issue and distracting to a different topic. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 06:54:22


nobody has to tell me that as it is simply logical. most people simply confuse one issue with another and believe blocksize has anything to do with centralization. centralization is due to other design features of bitcoin that have nothing to do with blocksize debate. (just because its the only wrong arguments by so many does not change the true effects)
that said i'm not here to have a discussion or debate here with people that lie and try to insult me. if u actually care about ur arguments and want to have a dialog i would be happy to engage.

Yes you can be a peer. I was a peer for a while. However there is no value in you being a peer if you don't mine. You don't need to be a peer to hold bitcoin or send transactions. You can have a light wallet and sent your tx to a miner. There might be a reason for business to be a peer, i.e. to monitor the network etc.
The key is that you can trust the network, not that you can verify every transaction of everyone else. That's the job of miners.
There is a consensus belief among people that bitcoin is decentralized when there are many nodes. However this is simply a misunderstanding of bitcoins design.

@_date: 2016-05-24 21:09:00
So the challenge is that these chips have one specific use case. Hence nobody but miners will buy them. So far it was a tech race that is now hitting its limit as you describe.
The point is by design this will lead to very few very specialized miners dominating the market. So this is the design flaw of Bitcoin imho where decentralization is needed for security but the mining is designed to be centralized.
Hence mining needs to change fundamentally, or the security cannot rely upon consensus mechanism.
Eth is partly trying to solve this buy proof of stake type of consensus, but this still leads to advantages of the rich I.e. A smaller form of centralization. So pops is likely much better than pow from a security perspective but still problematic from a centralization perspective.
Note also that these pose fast challenges for the currency as anytime a minority gets some sort of advantage this is bad for the "idealness" of the currency and hence reduces utility, which is the main driver for value.
However we never had an ideal system when it comes to money and always a cost of minting currency. So some form of domination might be ok.

Well no. Decentralidez but useless is not helpful.
So no u can't just look at this from one single view.
Also decentralization seem to not be addressed at all at this point. The blocksize limit as an example is a design that increases centralization. Mining is designed to be centralized and running nodes is not incentivized. All things that lead to centralization....
@_date: 2015-11-22 23:46:01
It's like having a a card to use a bank account, except now it's ur coinbase account.
But in general it makes no sense to spent it btc this way.
However it also makes no sense to not have one. So I would think if u have a CB account ur a bit of an idiot if u don't get one.
@_date: 2016-10-29 01:09:12
So u argue that nobody benefits from nodes. 
I dosagree that verifying is a strong enough incentive to run a node. One must trust the network, if the network does not work beingg able to verify this is not that useful as all value will be gone.
Again its about decentralized network which drives security, something nodes dont really conteibute to.there is no use having nodes when miners are corrupted.
Its all about miner decentralization, whoch is not impcted by blocksize. Block limit should be instead determined by miners.

its not the energy that matters. Energy consumption is a symptom.
its the chips and the general design of how mining works. it is designed to be dominated by a few players unless the chips become something that everyone has anyhow, like a CPU.

Running a node is already only expensive without any rewards and only makes sense if it is helpful to run a business. It is not designed for users. As such the blocksize is practically irrelevant for it.
@_date: 2015-11-07 06:40:32
well that is illogical, since the blocksize limit cause centralization and bigger blocks are better for the decentralization.
btw just now was the first time for me that a coinbase transaction did not go into the first block for me, because the block was full.
so in the future i need a service that works with coinbase and without the blockchain to send bitcoin between addresses.

Any blockchain talk is productive 
@_date: 2015-11-06 22:44:30
If I were to write this I would suggest:
- max_blocksize = 200% the average blocksize of the last 1000 blocks (200% being an example)
Reason: I think blocksize limit is useless in general as there is a economic blocksize equilibrium from miners wanting smallest possible blocks to prevent orphans (earning less) and getting fees from bigger blocks (earning more)
This naturally creates an blocksize target for miners that will be more accurate as a blocksize limit than anything some human will define. It will also create an optimal fee structure for txs. 
On the other hand if someone creates a block that is out of the world some nodes might try to download. To prevent problems that might arise from that a limit that prevents crazy outliers without restricting volume or transaction beyond its natural limitation is totally reasonable and should therefore be ok. Also if there is value to a limit it will be important that it may go down and not just up, this the 1000 blocks.

Now let me show you how would try to have a dialog with you:
You say bitcoin is designed to reduce the need for intermediate. To me this is also a key mission of bitcoin and in fact the first thing i noticed as such while reading the satoshi paper. "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution". A block size limit is contrary to this mission, while not having any value for any other part of bitcoin. Clearly you believe the block size limit is very important, which does not make sense to me. As such i would like to understand your thoughts and understand what i am missing. What is the value of the block size limit? 
At the same time do you also see the ability to send transaction directly thru the bitcoin network as valuable and thus the restriction of amount of transactions to less then what is demanded by users as something that is contrary to the goal of p2p nature and mission of bitcoin (or do we need to have a dialog about this as well).

I say the opposite is true. Btc and fiat won't be able to co-exist just like you cannot have a democratic dictator.
Government may adopt btc or create their own btc fork, but as soon as money will flow into btc fiat must collapse. Think about if 10-30% of usd value flows into btc: what would that do to btc price. It would sky rocket. At that point you would take on debt and pay it back with btc later. Rendering the all fiat debt worthless and collapsing the existing financial system

Correct. Miners have no incentive for big blocks. generally the bigger the blocks the slower they will propagate, which increase the chance of orphan blocks. Unless the fees for the tx they add to the block are higher than this risk.

Btc would be well suited for the cage. It would need to work both ways.
Better would be even if one could get chips and use btc as collateral.
Think about a poker player going to Vegas from a foreign country. That guy would like to go to a cage and get lets 20k in chips by leaving 25k in btc as escrow. He can now use this as his bankroll. At the end of his trip he would want to return the chips and pay the difference via btc or get his winning paid in btc.

@_date: 2016-10-25 04:00:45
Inflation is bad because it transfers value. It creates a tax on money, where money moves from everyone that holds it to the issuers of money.
Deflation does the same thing using different vehicles. It moves money to the holders of the currency. In fiat the banks profit in deflationary systems like Bitcoin the holders profit.
In the end deflation and inflation create artificial overhead, fees that functions like a taxand work against the purpose of money, which is to store value and allow people to transact. Both inflation and deflation work against this purpose in the exact same way, just using different vehicles. Both are bad for the economy, but good for a minority of society. The purpose of fiat is to create wealth re-distribution and the purpose of deflationary currency is the same thing. This is inherent from their design. The purpose of money is to be neutral and allow transfer of value and accounting &amp; storing of value. Deflation and inflation work against these purposes.
Bitcoin is great as an investment if we believe it survive because it increases in value over time. For the same reason it is bad money.
@_date: 2016-05-31 19:27:53

@_date: 2017-05-21 01:57:19
Yes. 20t is a small amount of global money supply. Or about as much as US has in debt. So even if bitcoin were to be used by only 300m people 1m per coin would be wayyyyy to small.
@_date: 2016-10-18 06:31:09
but to be fair. Of course a currency works without stability, however the most important attribute of a currency is stability.
In other words, currency should be more successful in a free market the more stable they are. Today currency is a monopoly by each state and as such 
Practically bitcoin could be almost as stable as gold if everyone would use it and once everyone would use it. 
I don't think that is likely as we already have cryptocurrencies that have brought stability or solved the stability issue some.
As you said gold is also not stable since its supply does not adjust. In order to have stable currency it must adjust its supply to the market it represents.
Fiat has tools to adjust its supply, however since it has to be inflationary that is practically useless since in the long run it has to inflate.
The point is that bitcoin has introduced a free market for money, which should now evolve a currency that will be stable.

You are right deflationary economy or currency are two very different things. This is why I was not speaking about economies, but money. Obviously a deflationary economy has a problem. 
The only effect both deflation and inflation have is that they leech the economies in which they are used, which is why they are bad. But they do this in the exact same way just opposite if that makes sense.

i read the XT implementation as well. i almost feel like this is better for dealing with attacks, because if you wanted to really spam the network you would now have to pay more than normal transaction if u wanted to prevent them from getting into blocks. so you would have to fill up the blocks urself with spam transactions.
the xt approach would make it so that overall both spam transaction and normal transactions would make it into blocks so it would be now beneficial(disruptive) to spam even with cheap txt fees.

Never ever use a company or bank to send money to a gambling site, no matter what country you are from.
When you have bitcoin transfer them to a private wallet, some software on your phone that stores the private keys. then send it to the gambling site.
do the reverse when you withdraw. 
You might be lucky since bovada uses a 3rd party payment service to process the tx, however still there is a trail to your account and this might get you in trouble.

They are connected to all the markets are simply an exchange. They just managed to build it in a way that you do not need an account. So instead of having u put money into an account and then transacting thru that account they create transactions only.
So imagine you but ltc for bitcoin.
Normal way:
1. create accounts for sellers and buyers (holds both btc and ltc)
2. Deposit btc funds (btc)
3. Seller creates an order that is matched with the buyer 
4. move money into respective accounts (from seller to buyer and vice versa)
1 create two transactions
a: you provide funds via btc address
b: you provide your ltc address
When you sent money to a shapeshift buys ltc with those funds and sends them b.

No he wants decentralization. Small blocks create centralization .
The fight against larger blocks comes from a side that wants to centralize Bitcoin and make it less democratic, censored and controlled by a few 
Small blocks create centralization because only the rich can transact and as such we need Bitcoin banks that work off chain and now we have a banking not system again while the mission of Bitcoin is p2p.
Most systems when free are being taking over by monopolies that seek control. Bitcoin is no different in that parties are trying this.
However I believe Bitcoin will succeed because so far it is enough decentralized that  it will be able to resist the censorship and control that is attempted by Bitcoin core and its supporters on Reddit etc.

btw this is the section of the paper that explains governance and why no-one but miners are to make governance decisions:".... The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. "

Sure u can always fork ur own coin. But again in bitcoin the network is run by miners because they are the ones putting up stake to do so. Their rewarded by market price which is determined by how users are valuing the coins.
Thus miners are the sole entity that governs bitcoin. If u dont get that then i suggest to re-read the whitepaper.
@_date: 2015-11-08 22:21:27


Ok. I am running two nodes (sometimes), core and the one that can't be mentioned here and i understand that there are resources required. it took me days to download the blockchain. However limiting the block sizes does not limit those resources whatsoever. 
If there had been no limit on the block size the blockchain would still be about the same size.
The design of bitcoin is about storing all transactions and that is the reason for those resources. This creates cost. While it is expensive to run a node there is no reward for it. So it is the overall design of bitcoin that leads to centralization not the blocksize. The block size has other uses and is not the cause of centralization. If we restrict the blocksize we destroy the use of bitcoin and its mission. we make it something that  now needs a banking system on top of it, which is precisely what we want to avoid. We make it more centralized as it already is and turn it into a b2b vs a p2p system. I understand some would benefit from this but i don't think from your remarks you are looking to have us all transact thru a 3rd party with bitcoin.
If you want people to run full nodes we need to design bitcoin in a way that this is possible. Today bitcoin is designed to only run by servers without reward, thus only few that have other benefits will run bitcoin nodes. 
This has nothing to do with the block size and this fact or design does not change with different blocksizes.
However putting an artificial cap ontop of the already natural block size limitation thru the economic forces creates additional centralization by excluding parties and long term 99% of participants from the p2p part of the network.
So again why would we want to support a design that creates more centralization and hurts bitcoin when you claim you want decentralized bitcoin?

I agree with that. I don't like this about bip101. 
First off blocksize limitations has no use in the first place. If there is a limit its not disruptive until demand reaches the limit. As such there simply should never be a limit.
If however there is value to a blocksize limit, then it should be dynamic to an avg over time or so and like you say not predict usage in the future but work from usage in the past, with enough history to deal with fluctuations and by having more weight on the recent past vs the older

However money supply and inflation/deflation are often confused.
Inflation/deflation is in regards to prices or value of one coin. This is impacted by the money supply and demand, but not the same thing, just like demand is not the same thing as deflation.

It's just an account on the blockchain, but not ID. So there is not much use/value.
@_date: 2016-07-18 10:26:44
There are software solutions that integrate into exchanges that you can use.
Coin base also has reports u may use.

In Bitcoin you cannot create more money from existing money, which is what fractional reserve money does.
As such I think the answer to your question is a clear yes.
However one can still lend money into existence. Bitshares does this as well as steem which are based on the same platform.
There are also projects in Ethereum that use financial tools to peg new money to an existing index.

Yes, by design the value of Bitcoin can only adjust via demand since the supply is fixed/predetermined. As such it can never be stable as the demand will never be stable, as such by design it will always be deflationary or inflationary depending on its ecology and demand.

It would just be amazing to have a btc etf...
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:36:03
If bitcoin goes to $1 it has failed
@_date: 2017-07-07 07:13:47
Ill suggest for you to read the bitcoin paper again, then you will notice that what i want is not mentioned and hence not part of bitcoin governance
@_date: 2017-07-03 22:33:46
Well if u had read it you would understand the role of miners. None of what you are saying has anything to do with bitcoin. Governance in bitcoin is very simple: miners run the network and form concensus and get rewarded by the market. Users have the choice to enter or exit and thus impact the market price.
Things that have no role on governance are developers and non-mining nodes. Uasf is simply trying to revolt agaibst how bitcoin is designed, which is fine and their right, but lets call it what it is. We will see if the design of bitcoin is faulty and will not sustain this attack.
@_date: 2016-07-11 20:43:07
Because the world always changes. Even if Bitcoin were the world currency, there would still be economic cycles which in turn would lead to unstable Bitcoin price.
@_date: 2016-07-24 06:05:23
Of course course they can!
@_date: 2016-07-03 03:22:02
Under my mattress!

Yes I think right now Bitcoin is limited. And I don't think we can stay here. I believe we have to grow or die. But I might be wrong.
Yes I use Bitcoin regularly. And I'm happy to see that Bitcoin very slowly creeps into other areas of society. I'm a poker player and some now use it to deposit and withdraw money with Bitcoin. That could be a game changer. However if this would become a main way to do payments 2tps will be a problem.
I hope you are right about the growing pains, and I a free with you and I am heavily invested. But not just Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-12 21:37:42
I see. You want to have a discussion I am here for the dialog.
@_date: 2016-07-08 22:00:04
It is stupid because its an artificial limit that caps the utility of bitcoin and causes centralization, without providing any benefit. It distorts a natural fee market with is essential for bitcoin and turns a free market into centrally planned one.
You also reference node counts, which has nothig to do with blocksize and little to do with centralization.
Bitcoin centralizations come from the concentration of miners, there are roughly 3 pools that have control over bit oin right now. 
I agree with you that centralizationnis an issue, but the powers in charge seem to not care, as nothing i hve seen on any roadmaps or proposel even adresses this topic.
Nodes do not provide decentralization, miners do foremost. But if we want to increase node-count than we would need to change the incentive for nodes. That however would be very low on my prio list.
@_date: 2016-07-08 11:28:03
Its not about fees. The market takes care of the price.
Its about being stupid and limiting the tx to 2tps and rendering bitcoin useless and as such worthless.
At this time its ok, because nobody is using bitcoin yet for anything. 
On the other hand there is literally no use to the limit and espeicially the particular size of 1mb.
I personally am flabergasted. I do however think that bicoin will fix itself.
@_date: 2016-07-10 16:00:09
What bs.
There is simply no currency's volatile as bitcoin except ither cryptos.
Bitcoin is unstable in value by design.
@_date: 2016-07-19 07:50:50
Well technically it's just a big number. U can come up with a number right?
Are u talking about actually creating the string that is btc address?
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:48:12
Jaxx is by far my favorite
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:01:25
And likely will be again in a few weeks
@_date: 2017-06-03 05:26:15
Because value cannot be stored when supply is fixes (in monetary sense)
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:34:50
@_date: 2017-06-30 05:13:46
I believe it when i see it
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:33:40
If u feel that way you should exit. Thatbis ur way of communicating that u dont like the fees. Unfortunately that is the only governance option users have
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:24:26
Having fun?
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:40:44
Well miners will follow the price. So if there are two chains price will dictate where miners go..
So centralization is going to be the same regardless. Either bitcoin has a decentralization issue or not. I dont think the fork is going to change this aspect much.
@_date: 2016-07-12 17:58:12
Well i have not discovered anything in bitcoins design that would create stability. By design i see it as unstable
What in your opinion makes bitcoin stable
@_date: 2016-07-04 03:19:52
I dont think it matters very much in the long run. In the span of a year or two it matters, but i doubt we will even feel it when it happens, asside feom the media buzz etc.
Of course the effect of slower money creating will be very impactful, but we wont be able to "see" it as the price is driven by so many things.
If i were Satoshi i would keep this simple and focus on more important things.....
@_date: 2016-07-30 21:57:41
They don't support ETC chain, so they only have to provide the ETH to you.
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:01:45
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:06:44
Nope they can't. 
If they want to regulate Bitcoin they need to get access to it. As such they need to control mining, which likely renders Bitcoin useless since that would corrupt it's security.
But right now they would only need to control 2-3 miners, so it seems quite doable.
@_date: 2016-07-30 22:32:59
i withdrew some btc from btc-e and coinbaise just to see if withdrawals work at all. 
Coinbase has not sent the tx to the blockchain.
BTC-E cam thru right away.
@_date: 2016-07-18 04:54:39
Would be great
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:01:43
Lolz fishy fishy
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:41:14
Lolz. And probably also a similar price like back then
@_date: 2016-07-11 20:38:54
It's ok. They can do it. It's already a Pain the ass....
Does not change the dynamics, only increases the value to get out of fiat and I to crypto.
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:30:19
It's a bad bad sign
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:51:13
We will see. Bitcoin has gone from 90% of my portfolio to 15% without me selling any. The internal political bs is quite annoying. But there are plenty if solutions out there. If btc does not get their shit together something will do it for it. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 00:33:53
holy shit 30% vig!!!!
ripp off.
