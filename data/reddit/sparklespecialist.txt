I mean I don’t care too much since I won’t likely keep it in bitcoin form any time soon anyways. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:54:03
I was attempting to set up a wire transfer account with Coinbase but it was not very easy to get all the information they wanted which was a bunch
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:43:23
I meant card in general. Am using my debit card/checking account. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:36:15
He SOLD it for 10k you fucktard. He didn’t buy it for 10k....
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:36:06
I have it currently in Coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:11:54
I mean say it goes up to 18000 a coin. I have 330 worth right now and that take my value up to 1070. But say it takes ten years.  I won’t really need 700 dollars when I’m 32 but as a college student the extra money is nice. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 04:12:41
How do I know which exchange would be good for mountain America?
@_date: 2018-11-16 04:20:37
Yeah I’m gonna sit on it for a little bit and see what happens because I don’t care about astronomical gain since I have so little
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:15:43
32 or 64 bit?
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:47:45
Lol wow so much coin. Much money. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:37:19
I am willing to sit on it for a little bit to get a little bit more of a short-term profit if it were to go back up from this big drop
@_date: 2018-11-15 22:02:21
See that’s where I’m not an idiot. I got it paid out to block chain first then transferred to Coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:15:27
I mean if it crashed I might actually buy 100 more dollars worth. I have SOME money off be willing to invest. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 22:03:15
How and where would I trade it?
@_date: 2018-11-17 02:16:24
How does one mine a risky coin and why is it risky?
Also does the asic side require buying hardware?
@_date: 2018-11-28 08:52:06
Okay so it’s like buying the cheap coins but instead of fiat you’re buying via computer power and electricity bills. 
So what crypto would be feasible (just humor the question) for a decent gaming pc to mine?
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:10:31
Can both run on one device?
@_date: 2018-11-15 22:08:27
But how would I gain from trading?
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:59:07
And what makes you believe this? It’s been paid out and is in my wallet buddy. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 00:02:56
Move preferably to a ledger yes. I currently have BTC and XRP sitting in edge. 
Other than a ledger where is a next best storage option?
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:17:06
An ATM?? And I have a coin base account but not a coin base pro account. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:00:56
I’m just wanting an easy extra 70 bucks or so from my gambling win. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:35:11
Can’t tell if satire or serious?
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:01:44
I mean I doubt bitcoin will go up to crazy high values again. I just want an easy extra 70-100 dollars. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 02:13:45
I actually currently have nicehash running and my computer is estimated for .00005144 a day so basically nothing. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:03:41
Ride or die I see. But at what point is hero?
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:52:31
Man I’ve been reading your comments and you the real mvp. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:10:43
I’m keeping it for a short term like $100 gain. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:05:42
Nowhere in this picture does it say “buy bitcoin”
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:48:45
I know it’s cheaper but I am having issues finding my banks intermediary ID
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:22:03
How much BTC do you have??
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:44:03
Do they allow debit cards?
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:07:47
Bitcoin obviously. My desktop. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:30:08
God damnit ������
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:35:24
Thx bro 
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:14:15
How much does a nice set up mine in a day?
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:35:01
Bruh. You think I’m retarded don’t you?
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:40:09
You hope at least. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 00:37:58
I did the math and it will have to go back up to $18,000 per coin to be worth $1070
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:07:18
But what basis do have to say that?
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:57:58
I will go and check out Gemini wallet. Do you know if they have a mobile app? I also have edge. With some in it
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:08:59
I mean you can tell me what I already or just answer the question. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 02:29:30
That doesn’t sound profitable to anybody 
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:10:10
Thanks man. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:47:45
So I just so happened to win .0598302 bitcoin gambling and received it during the low price just now. Show i sit on it or just cash out?
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:38:57
I have a buyer for 400. I could sell to Coinbase for 330. So you can screw off woth that offer. 
However I am deleting this post as it violates the rules anyways. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 17:06:28
Oh yeah no offense taken. Holy shit. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 00:23:59
A ledger? What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-11-17 02:20:19
Geoforce gtx 970
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:12:34
I see. What one is better? I am just curious to see it happen really though. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:22:05
I don’t have debt except my car payment which I am solid on paying (paying 15 extra every month even) but I am still not the most financially secure as a student. So I realize my free investment in bitcoin from this gambling win but also in extreme cases it still isn’t a huge gain. Unless it went up astronomically relatively fast. I might sell once my worth goes up to 400 or more. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:52:01
Do you think it will go back up? I have 330 worth in bitcoin and if it goes up by 1000/coin I will get almost 70 dollars extra to my gambling winnings 
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:25:11
Thanks man! I recently bought 9 ounces of silver but that is a much less volatile investment and I bought it BECAUSE of my winnings (I only let myself gamble 35 after doing 150 dollars worth of extra work so I didn’t gamble any savings away if I lost.l) 
I see the potential gain in bitcoin but if my gambling winnings go up to a worth of 400 or more simply due to luck timing in when I received it I will likely just cash out. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:56:03
I got this bitcoin with unexpectedly lucky timing. I’ve never bought bitcoin and played a casino website who payed out in bitcoin even though I wagered dollars. So now I am hoping to increase my gambling winnings. 
This all started with 35 dollars I expected to lose (don’t gamble much but felt like it last weekend)
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:17:42
Dude. Not cool. My antivirus flagged that as soon as o downloaded it. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 04:19:48
Should I get my risky quick of the day in?
@_date: 2018-11-16 00:25:06
I have it in Coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 07:47:21
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:53:59
You think that’s the worst case scenario??
@_date: 2018-11-16 07:16:16
I have no idea what movie that is. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 02:23:03
Well what would be a minimum in your opinion to mine raven coin. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 22:58:57
Yeah that’s fair. I also might just use if for being able to afford dope Christmas gifts 
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:48:17
Well I have a decent paying job. Like 18 an hour or more depending on work load. And I do lyft if I want side money. So yeah you’re correct there.  Just want to make a little bit more short term gain. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:12:22
I MIGHT buy some more if it takes a decent dip again. 
Being a student and all I need readily available money but I do have some liquid money to invest. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:45:05
Well I mean. I don’t gamble much and only let myself gamble 35 dollars after doing 150 dollars worth of work. 
I’m just hoping for maybe an extra 70-100 dollars. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:36:21
Oh really? My bad!
