I'm enjoying the course and I think it's important for us to take opportunities to learn more formally, which is why I encouraged Coin Telegraph to write this article. I'm Stephen, co-founder of Coin Academy.

Yes, very Bitcoin friendly! I'm in Ubud and as you can see from coinmap.org, there's a good number of brick &amp; mortar businesses as well as freelancers willing to accept bitcoin. I think the reason is that Ubud in particular has a thriving co-working and tech incubation space, Hubud(.org) as well as a number of other startup groups and programming learning holidays. If you're interested, join Bitcoins in Bali on FB.

Nice little piece today on Skift.com. The article, titled Bali’s Bid to Become a Bitcoin-Friendly Vacation Destination, takes a look at the nascent Bitcoin scene in Bali.
They provide a nice summary of what’s going on here, and in the process give Coin Academy a mention (thanks, guys!). Though it may strike some as rather surprising to find out that palm-thatched, sun-drenched Bali is a mecca for Bitcoin activity, the article is accurate. There’s a surprising amount going on there.

Our Coin Academy courses are more suited toward bridging the gap and encouraging mainstream people to get involved with Bitcoin. Khan Academy has good courses for people who are already into Bitcoin an want to understand the mechanics behind it. I'm Stephen, co-founder of Coin Academy.

Hi, I'm Stephen, the co-founder of Coin Academy. 
Thanks  this IS really what we need to bridge the gap between those of us who have learned this on our own, and our friends on the other side who need a helping hand to get involved. That's where we need to go to encourage the mass adoption of Bitcoin! 
 yes, absolutely there is a way to help contribute content, either by contributing links directly in courses, or by email.
Thanks again for your support!

The Bank of Indonesia has just announced that bitcoin is not an official-recognized medium of payment in Indonesia, pouring water on a fintech sector that was just getting fired up.
