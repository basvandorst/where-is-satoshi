u/freewallet_support Request ID 688ab1ed-8328-5bf6-b520-5cbd2303c0fe never went through and I am unable to withdraw the 10.02 XMR from it because it is stuck in sending mode for days. Either push the transaction through or cancel it and put the 10.02 XMR back into my balance NOW so I may withdraw it. Do not make me ask again. Resolve it NOW.

u/freewallet_support THE FUNDS CANNOT BE ACCESSED! All ANYONE has to do is look at the HUNDREDS of scam complaints against you. I have now sent you two ORIGINAL, untouched sets of photos. The photos were sent DIRECTLY from my camera. DIRECTLY! ANYONE can see that by looking at them. I even sent you a link to a live, untouched video PROVING the photos were legit. You are a SCAM and these BS posts from you are not going to save you now. You stole my ID and my funds and you are going to pay. The photos are in the hands of the US Attorney, who has now directly labeled you a scam. YOU ARE DONE, I WILL SEE TO IT.

[**u/freewallet\_support**]( Look at the LYING SCAMMERS at Freewallet everybody who are now going to be prosecuted. I have confirmation that ONLY law enforcement has the legal authority to hold our funds through a court order. These fund holds are a complete SCAM. Freewallet CLEARLY stated to me that ALL I needed was THREE PHOTOS to get access to MY funds. I saved that message so they can never say otherwise. They said the photos were the **ONE AND ONLY condition**. NOW, all of a sudden, they want screenshots of transactions that are impossible to show, because THEY KNOW they were done through Shapehsift, which nobody would have access to. You have NO right to ask for transaction info as a "wallet", AND you already know most people obtained Monero through Shapeshift where we have NO account and cannot get the transaction screenshot. I have NO access to those transactions, LIKE ANYONE who used Shapeshift does not. Unfortunately for you, you have now proven your scam and it this is going forward to prosecution through the US Attorney/Interpol. YOU ARE DONE. I will see to it. You'll find out what happens to people who take advantage of the sick

Its a WALLET, it is NOT an investment.  Losses are NOT to be expected with a wallet.

That may be true, but contacting authorities is LONG overdue. This is a wallet provider, not an investment. Losses are not to be expected. Where victims like me have gone wrong is in not realizing you never use a wallet that doesn't provide the private key. Our mistake, yes, but I'm not letting them get away with this
