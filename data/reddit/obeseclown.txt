It's a USB drive. Bonus points for making it with a live Linux CD

More information: I got this email from Dropbox talking about an updated Terms of Service and what have you. I clicked the link given, and saw that, although they protect against "blanket requests" from governments, they won't hesitate to give information. 
Hopefully this will teach people who want to remain anonymous to **NOT STORE BITCOIN ON DROPBOX**. I'm not *particularly* interested in keeping my identity hidden, but I know a lot of Bitcoiners are.
Tell me what you guys think!

No, not totally, because they could in theory break the encryption. If you want a wallet that syncs across all devices, Electrum is safest.

(I haven't discussed bitcoin in over a year so I'm a bit rusty)
Why would they (XT) make blocks bigger than 1 megabyte?

Ah. Who do you think is right (bigger or hack/sidechain)? This sub seems angry at the mods for supporting one side (not sure which).
Also, what is a a sidechain?

Yeah, I wish i never fell out of the loop! So what would dictate going from Bitcoin to (sidechain) Sidecoin? Could I just switch them manually? Would the only motive for switching my money from Bitcoin to Sidecoin be whatever is different on one blockchain than the other (for example, cheaper "tax" on microtransactions)? 
Also, isn't faster confirmation only relevant to the amount of people mining with relation to the amount of transactions? If miners switch from Bitcoin to Sidecoin or vice versa to get a better reward and everyone switches from Bitcoin to Sidecoin (or vice versa) for faster confirmation, won't that balance them out?

I don't think I follow for what a sidechain is. Would that be an altcoin with the same block size limit, or just another blockchain to split the workload? It seems like more trouble than it's worth instead of making the blocks bigger.

Maybe this is because I don't understand what a "sidechain" is (another user explained it as a sort of altcoin that is transferable to Bitcoin), but it seems like if it will work now *and* that the original intent of that limit was to be temporary and has been since Satoshi, then I guess I have no idea why a sidechain would be a logical answer.
