Point taken! We will develop this one! Do you know developers who might be interested? What kind of faucet we'll need is going to be very special and very different one. Suggestions?

Well, you've been the first to come out with this one :) history must knows its heros. :)

boxhit, you seem to really know where you're heading to and where the future of the project lies. Can you elaborate on what is a voting token and how we proceed to enable citizens with it?
I've opened a group "Council to give citizens voting token"
to gather right people and have more technical talk on Religy.com.

Your fantastic enthusiasm just sets an example for everyone. Your comments were so inspiring, i've posted my take on them:
We have what to discuss further as i opened a group Full Node Fridays on my web-site whose leader you might be interested to become.
