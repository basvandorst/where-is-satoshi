Get verified on a different exchange, and send bitcoin to that exchange and withdraw from there?
Or do you mean withdraw as in send bitcoin to another wallet?

John McAfee is predicting 1mill by end of 2020, otherwise he will eat his dick on television. His previous prediction was 500k by end of 2020 but up'd it.

Bitcoin.org is the proper site, not Bitcoin.com

I 99% guarantee you that your problem is that you have a keylogger or worse on your computer.

Sounds like fanfiction. If anything were to happen, the most would be that the market will drop to ~8k soon after it hits 10k then within 1-2 weeks be back to new peaks.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:53:01
Because the backlog of unconfirmed transactions hasn't been cleared up yet since the whole BCH vs BTC thing. 
Once this clears up, it will be back to normal. It has already gone down like 50k so far in 12~ hours from 175k. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:13:53
Yeah.. I forgot about that too. Independent Reserves daily limit is $10k electronic funds transfer and $5k daily POLi transfers. So basically $15k a day. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:23:32
Not everyone lives in the U.S, nor is it worth it to tank a 4% fee for instant deposits when many other exchanges support instant deposits for &lt;$5
Say you have $5k, 4% of that is almost $200... That is quite a bit of money that just disappears.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:42:31
Well wish I had followed suit with what you said, because I was going to wait until the weekend and bam, it is now basically 7k &gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:02:28
I'm not either, today I put in 10k and I payed $6.6 (two transactions of $3.3 to buy using POLi) and the exchange has free withdraw. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:20:28
No it isn't, I have been doing a bunch of transactions with a fee of only 0.0006 and it takes less than 20min. The same as OP.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:59:47
According to John McAfee, it will reach 1million by end of 2020, otherwise he will eat his dick- 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:27:47
1.5% of $5k is still $74, and bank transfers take 1-2 business days and you can easily miss an opportunity to buy a dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:43:36
Buy on Independent Reserve, it will save you lots of money because of CoinBases stupid 4% fee, whereas Independent Reserves is either $1 for electronic funds transfer (2-3 business day wait), or $3.3 for instant &lt; $5k or 1 business day for &gt;$5k.
So think about it, $5k deposit on CoinBase would cost you almost $200.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:19:30
People use exchanges that have little to no deposit fees, a lot of which have instant deposits (coinbase is one of, if not the WORST places to buy bitcoin) and just set buy orders so if bitcoin drops to a certain point that they specified, it auto-buys for them. 
Either that or people have their eyes peeled to their screens watching it for 99% of the day while awake ;)
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:38:35
It isn't.
End of story.

Safest option: Hodl until a crash then buy the crash and continue to Hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:55:10
It isn't rising, it is falling. With the whole BCH fiasco it kept rising all the way to like 175k, but now that it is mostly over it has already dropped to 125k in a day and will continue to drop back to normal. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:06:47
Depends if you want to give the person who provides the referral with a kickback. 
You can leave it blank and nothing bad will happen, or you can use mine if you're generous lol- NLEZGK

That site will need to be updated because he now bets 1mill by end of 2020.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:50:17
As already said, that site is a 'scam' site. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:10:55
Or in Australia, if you do Schoolies say in like Surfers Paradise (1 week of partying when you finish your final year of high school), they don't give a shit about all the 17year olds and sometimes 16 years old drinking until the point that they can barely walk.


@_date: 2017-11-28 10:10:25
Then use a debit card???
If you don't have one of those either then just go to your online banking and order one, for free...
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:19:15
We just had a correction though, so the next one won't happen for a little bit and won't drop below or to the current price would it?
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:50:19
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:10:47
It is simple math, if you buy $50 of bitcoin at 10k(roughly now), and bitcoin goes to 20k you now have $100 worth of bitcoin. Most places have a 1% withdraw fee so now you have $99. 
Regardless if you buy $50 or $5000, if bitcoin doubles so does your initial amount you deposited. So the answer to 'will I see the value of it increase at all', depends all on how long you wait and how high bitcoin goes. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:36:01
Yeah well, 2.5k is already in the account now so it isn't a loss or anything, I will watch it from now until I go to sleep, if it doesn't appear to be going down I'm just going to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:57:38
idk where you are trying to buy a bitcoin, but it is free or like &lt;$5 on most exchanges...
Also, some exchanges offer free withdraw...
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:16:15
You need 2 forms of ID, so if you cannot get one of the other two, you are sod out of luck. 
You can get a drivers license at the age of 16 in most countries, so just go for it...
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:50:34
Have you tried Independent Reserve?
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:32:51
Look at the top graph, it peaked around 180k then ever since it has been dropping once all the miners flipped from BCH back to BTC, and is now down to 120k
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:48:57
What did you set your miners fee to?
I was just transferring bitcoin between accounts a few hours ago and it took not even 30minutes. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:53:18
If you can invent a way to travel to alternate universes where there are no outlandish rates for using PayPal, then sure.
Otherwise, you are going to have to suck it up or just do what most people do and use an actual debit or credit card or do a cash deposit...
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:35:00
Problem 1: Using Coinbase.
Problem 2: Miners need to get paid.
Problem 3: There is like 25k unconfirmed transactions so the fees are a little higher than usual.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:09:36
I am 20 and also a software engineer (undergrad, in my final 4th year next year for honours) basically I have put a bit less than half my savings into it over the last weekish, and even if I don't buy at the most opportune moment I just shrug it off as "It will go up anyway, so a tiny bit of bitcoin won't hurt in the long run".
 
So my solution to how do I manage the stress, is that I don't stress in the first place. Life goes on and when I am comfortable, I will sell.

"Through a reform implemented in Sweden, September 1993, the age limit for practising car driving was lowered from 17 1/2 to 16 years" 
"In Sweden, the minimum age is 16 years old to get a basic car learner's permit" 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:34:41
He changed it to 1million by end of 2020. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:19:45
A learners permit can be given at the age of 16 in Sweden, all you need is the ID, you don't need to know how to drive a car yet lol.
PS: Learners permits still count, my friend only has a learners licence and he got accepted.

I am in Australia.
@_date: 2016-09-17 16:29:41
They have such a big fee using credit card unfortunately :/
@_date: 2016-09-17 14:50:17
What no? I have just never payed for anything in bitcoin until now.
@_date: 2016-09-17 16:14:29
I get authentication failed :/
@_date: 2016-09-17 14:50:26
Thanks I will check it out.
@_date: 2016-09-17 14:51:01
I checked out localbitcoins and in my country everyone is being stingy and most require a physical cash deposit.
@_date: 2016-09-17 16:02:58
Yeah I checked localbitcoins and basically everyone is asking for cash deposit. It is 2am so that is not possible right now. Thanks anyway!
@_date: 2016-09-17 14:58:25
Oh no haha I don't have ransomware on my PC, I am purchasing private software that has limited slots.
@_date: 2016-09-17 14:52:34
I will check it out, thanks.
@_date: 2016-09-17 15:29:26
I checked it out and it does not support debit cards outside of the US and UK unfortunately.
@_date: 2016-09-18 08:40:07
Transaction went smooth, got my Bitcoins within minutes. Thank you very much!
