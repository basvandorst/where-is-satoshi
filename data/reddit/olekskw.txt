Thought you're asking only about crypto. Overall I'm 10% crypto, rest is real estate, stocks, bonds and cash

Exactly. Drives me mad seeing all those 'got home-equity loan, went all in, now he's sitting on $200m from Bitcoin'. This is dangerous shit

I meant r/Bitcoin reddit, sorry

Nope. It's a difference between being a begineer in crypto and being a cocky person who made 3x money on their investment and is now preaching that BTC is God and people should hold forever. As I stated at the end, I am not against new people in crypto. I am against illiteracy

Not much of a difference though, no? Coinbase &lt;-&gt; GDAX transfers are instant

BTC, ETH, LTC, IOTA

Hey, i transffered 0.3416 BTC with 0.002045 fees (250s/b) 10 hours ago (from Blockchain to Coinbase). Blockcypher says 'Miner preference: high' and 98% confidence, but 0/6 confirmations... any idea when can I expect this to go through?

Very frustrating. Might as well start keeping all my coins at GDAX, avoiding high fees and time wasted. Not sure if security is THAT of an issue
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:49:55
Why is there a huge difference between GDAX and Blockchain exchange? 200 EUR per one coin

Update on a case - not sure what happened, but I transfered my all legitimate coins to Blockchain and closed Jaxx for good. 
Maybe that was just a display issue, not real money - no idea. 
Did not take stranger's coins, I just feel like this is wrong and cannot imagine what I would do if roles were reversed
