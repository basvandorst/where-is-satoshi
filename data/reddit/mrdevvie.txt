Because banks are tied by goverment regulations and need to scan for certain activities.

No idea about crypto, my friend send me some money and put in the description for fun “loan intrest 20%”
My bank actually took a huge chunk of that money as I’m obligated to pay taxes if I hand out loans as a private person. (Belgium)
When I contacted the bank and said he wrote is as a joke they gave me back the money and explained me the system has certain words that are filtered for these reasons and thats how the wire got spotted.
So yes they actually do check your descriptions for keywords as I have been saying..

Its not an assumption my god you people are clueless, I KNOW they automatedly search it for certain words.. The amount of stupidity in these threads is beyond believe..

You know that’s completely automated right, in what century do you live in? They scan the note section for certain words and they will get flagged if used. 
Trust me I have had this before on another issue non crypto related...
