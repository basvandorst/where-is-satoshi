I’m sure it’s true to some extent but I wouldn’t stake my BTC on it.
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:34:55
They may have spoofed your phone number. I don’t think Authy uses keys, just your phone number. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:10:31
Cash on local bitcoins, maybe? You can find some deals on there. ATMs charge too much.

BCC would still take 10 minutes and is open to double spend attacks within that frame. 
Also its chain would bloat exponentially.
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:02:44
You can link your public address, but never the private key. You shouldn’t even type in the private key on an internet connected system, ever. 
You only reveal the private key when it’s time to spend, and even then doing so on an offline system is ideal. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:50:49
Your texts and calls can be intercepted by a malicious third party. Authy basically sends your phone an SMS (text) and the hacker may have intercepted it. All phone numbers are to some degree vulnerable.
TOTP is an offline time-based alternative 2FA method. It's far superior but you must initialize it on a clean system.
Format your computer or get a new one if you're really paranoid. $500 isn't much in the long run.

They publicly said they can issue a rogue firmware but they’d need the device in person to steal your coins. I don’t exactly want to trust them on that. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:01:51
HODL. Lots of stock market rules have no place here in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:16:44
LOL this guy just compared a guitar to Bitcoin in a reply to my comment below, it's pretty clear he's got no interest in understanding any of this.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:22:01
You should research online. Bitcoin didn't break $100 billion with Wall Street interest for no reason.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:34:12
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:05:45
That’s a pile of crap. 
Also Bitfinex is shutting down services for US users within the week.
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:48:21
0.0005 for it. I'll roll it up and use as intended.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:12:29
Cash deposit on local bitcoins works as well. You just walk into a bank and deposit cash into a sellers account. You may need to show ID but there is no age limit for deposits so you’ll be good. 
Make sure your seller has high feedback ratings and use the escrow system.
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:28:32
Go to Coinbase, hit send, type in the address from your Ledger, the amount, and hit send.
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:42:54
Get outta here
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:36:35
Media coverage and the rising price are definitely helping.  What made you want to use it? People will pile in for the same reasons.
Also it’s a great way to hide and/or protect your money from prying eyes and the government. As an example, anyone can carry $billions in bitcoin all in their brain, across war zones undetected. No other asset can facilitate such things.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:31:24
should i have said BTC is worth 77 million ounces of gold instead? or how about 80 billion loaves of bread?
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:27:58
100x? I don’t see Ether ever reaching $3 trillion. I don’t think Litecoin would ever get to $300 billion either, considering they aren’t dominant and will probably never be. 
But I totally see Bitcoin passing 100x at a $10 trillion cap. It’s well on its way already what with the cascading network effects. We’re witnessing the rise this very moment. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:20:20
You can store BTC in your brain.
Research a bit further.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:06:37
How is this bitcoin related?
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:07:52
Yes, it will keep rising like this. 
What we’re seeing now is similar to the steep internet growth charts of the 90s, except Bitcoin growth is directly measured in price.
Google “asymptotic curve” - it’s where we’re headed. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:07:37
You joked yourself
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:45:23
Tangibility and malleability aren’t prerequisites for value.
Jewelry and electronics are some of the uses gold’s properties allow. As I said, bitcoin has its own set of properties. 
Bitcoin can send value to anywhere in the universe in around 10 minutes. You can carry billions of dollars in a brain wallet, undetected. Bitcoin can be used to make irreversible transactions, and offers unfettered access to your money any time. All this is achieved with a huge degree of anonymity.
These are only some of the properties that give it its current valuation. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:17:54
Yes, I think it’s a bad idea. Alts are nothing more than a gamble as of now, whereas Bitcoin is virtually a sure thing.
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:07:50
You can just download bread on iOS or Android and store your BTC on there, provided your phone isn't jailbroken or rooted. It's reasonably secure, even for larger amounts.
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:36:09
Just be glad you didn’t lose too much and consider this a wake up call to improve your opsec.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:15:42
I’m rooting for this moron 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:28:50
Just about every other crypto would have high fees and wait times if even a fraction of the BTC user base was to move over. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:23:55
I've got five figures in my head at all times.

Some people don’t bother to pick up a book. Ever.
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:07:05
Lol hw wallets definitely are not the safest 
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:23:01
What backs gold’s value? Nothing but the laws of physics, which gives it certain properties. Its price is determined by demand, derived from the uses of those properties. 
Bitcoin is similar. It is backed by mathematics, which gives it its unique properties, like immutability and strong security. Its demand and by extension its price is determined through them.
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:24:23
You wish
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:47:35
I’m hoping someone asks a question regarding bitcoin. 
Amazon for sure won’t reveal plans for btc today otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:46:32
Title needs a /s
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:48:49
I’m asking if Ledger the company can swoop in remotely and take my btc. I’m sure a rogue employee can issue a firmware that reveals the seed remotely, no?
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:29:08
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:14:55
Provided you didn't use **TOTP 2FA** with Authy, and just **SMS**, they probably have access to your phone number – it isn't too difficult to do. Not much you can do about it other than switching over to TOTP entirely, after you clean up your computer.
Your computer is so thoroughly hacked though, it seems. I'd take a shotgun to it.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:37:18
Ledger says they can’t, but if it came down to it can they remote steal my btc?
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:17:03
Google is your friend
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:27:33
You need a computer. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:41:49
Not just money moths, but inflation as well. 
As more people adopt and use this currency, the demand will increase and therefore the price will follow. It’s the laws of supply and demand at play. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:49:48
Maybe, maybe not. 
But I guarantee you, you’d be way more pissed if BTC hits $10,000 than if it falls to $4000. Don’t risk the huge upside for just a few hundo per coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:03:18
You can transfer that to Gemini. You can sell any amount there. 
Also, if you place a limit order on GDAX I’m sure it’ll go through.
With that said, HODL
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:22:47
I’d be a far richer man if it weren’t for fucking bitcoin casinos. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:59:11
Bitcoin will eventually be used to pay for things directly, so there will be no need to sell when the time comes.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:10:52
send it to me, ill be expecting it in 10 minutes.
seriously, thats the best you could come up with?
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:31:43
The fork will be a non issue. The miners will always mine the more profitable chain. It’s in less than 3 weeks, so we’ll see for sure very soon.
Edit: fork, singular. Also, if an alt ever grows to Bitcoin’s size fork upgrades will be necessary to scale.
