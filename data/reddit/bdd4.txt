I said this and got negged. If people removed their coin right after they finished trading especially overnight when they're asleep, these events would be dramatically lessened. Pay the fee to move it back and forth. Lose 65¢ or $100k? Would you leave your house open while you went to work? Probably not. Pain in the ass, sure, but not this painful.

Not your question, but it makes sense why you're missing what I'm saying. 
Putting more currency into circulation doesn't necessarily mean devaluation. The percent of a country's worth put into circulation is up to that country. Printing more money without increasing the value backing the note devalues the currency. 
I'm saying that countries with more of their value as currency probably have more crime.

Offering company shares IN Hong Kong means you have to register there, which they are not. 
Apparently you didn't read. Part of the issue was also because "actual delivery" wasn't happening to the satisfaction of CFTC until they made changes, which brings us here.

Apparently you haven't read Dodd Frank and the fact that they were fined for not delivering Bitcoin per the law, which is what caused this. They cannot legally lend in that way. Price is the last trade. Trading volume is still trading volume. Regardless of what's sitting. 
ETA: The amount of Bitcoin sitting and not being traded FAR exceeds the legal maximum on margin at any given moment and Bitfinex was exceeding that margin, hence the $75k fine. Ya know... If you can read and all. If exchanges are abiding the rules, the price does NOT depend on money sitting idle in exchanges.

But I know by admission that people are leaving coin in exchange for WAY more that 24 hrs. Not every BTC holder is a trader. People who have never traded leave their money on exchanges because they're gambling or doing things with Bitcoin that may be legal, but Coinbase and Circle don't allow. Trade margins are not infinite. They can only trade at 15% margin and exchange holdings far exceed that.

US has 5x the population, but ~20x the currency value in circulation and we have the same GDP growth. US has 4x the homicide rate.

The problem I see is that poor people can't afford the down end of the volatility. However, when people are on other social media talking about how they know people succumbing to collections, I turn prophet. "Have you heard of Bitcoin?" 
Can't be garnished. Can't be subject to any writ. I mean, they can lock you up, but first they have to know about it. 
Also, poor people don't have cars to be going to the bank every week. Where I am, low-paying jobs are more likely to pay weekly than bi-weekly and the minimum fee to keep a bank account is sometimes too high. I don't have to go into the bank fee in this sub. They also don't have time to wait for their checks to clear because they don't have the account history for the check to clear same day. 
Furthermore, the main reason poor people with no transportation don't shop online and enjoy lasse faire is because they don't have credit cards and bank accounts. All those problems are eliminated. 
With cheap cell phones (especially Android), the only hurdle is education because the benefits are an easy sell especially with services like Bitpay and Bitwage.

They have to pay back the people who loaned, yes, but my understanding is they will close pending positions. If they buy Bitcoin at $585 and sell at $604, that would subsidize that position by taking $604 in fiat instead of $585. Also, their existing coin was likely bought at much lower prices. This works out because there wasn't a huge buy at the time. The price was already going down. This depend on numbers we don't have like how much Bitfinex paid for Bitcoin it used as capital for margins and how much Bitcoin that was. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:56:59

Here's your answer. Looks like I was right. It'll be traded like shares, not crypto. Typical Reddit to downvote. 
Interim Announcement
August 6, 2016
 
Following the theft on August 2nd, the Bitfinex team has been working tirelessly towards bringing the platform back online in a secure and controlled manner. We have finalized the accounting of losses incurred and are currently coordinating strategic plans for compensating customers.
 
We intend to come online within 24-48 hours with limited platform functionality. Additional announcements will be made as we progressively enable more platform features and return to full operations. We appreciate that our customers and the public want this handled quickly, but it needs to be done a way in which all assets are secure and immune from vulnerabilities. Every resource is being leveraged to make that happen in a safe and optimal way.
 
As disclosed in earlier announcements, all withdrawals, open orders, and open funding offers have been cancelled and all financed positions have been settled. Exact settlement prices were published on August 3rd.
 
After much thought, analysis, and consultation, we have arrived at the conclusion that losses must be generalized across all accounts and assets. This is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context. Upon logging into the platform, customers will see that they have experienced a generalized loss percentage of 36.067%. In a later announcement we will explain in full detail the methodology used to compute these losses.
 
We are actively discussing various strategic options with numerous potential investors as part of our strategy to fully compensate our customers. Such discussions, however, are in early stages and will likely take time to play out. In the meantime, In place of the loss in each wallet, we are crediting a token labeled BFX to record each customer’s discrete losses. Tokens will be distributed without release or waiver. The BFX tokens will remain outstanding until redeemed in full by Bitfinex or possibly exchanged—upon the creditor’s request and Bitfinex’s acceptance—for shares of iFinex Inc. We are still sorting out many details on this; we will post further updates in the coming days.
 
Thank you for your continued patience and for the many generous offers of support that we have received over the last several days. Notwithstanding this attack, we continue to believe in the possibilities associated with bitcoin. We will continue to update our customers and the public as and when we can.

[Consumer Finance]( is also extremely swift. If what I hear is there that their USD is held in US banks, they can help. I made a complaint after the bank refused to credit me interest. Opened my auto loan. They didn't actually open the loan for 45 days, so I couldn't make a payment, but they wanted to charge me interest from the delivery day even though they gave no opportunity to pay and avoid interest. I got $230 credited to my account within a week. The bank receive the complaint within 3 days and called *me*. I'd cover all possible bases and file a complaint there, too, if that's what you want.

In fact, if people aren't committing crimes, then it's probably a sign we can get rid of most currency altogether. Crime and government create much of our need for currency to begin with. Wouldn't need bank accounts and paper money if people wouldn't steal gold, food, etc.

Your hint is worth shit. The point is to show that Bitcoin and gold are increasing with similar market behaviors. If they did it based on market cap, the Bitcoin chart would be so small, you wouldn't even be able to see it on the damn screen. 
I'm a senior data analyst and I can tell you executives want charts like this. They ask for them. Specifically. If it didn't make sense to anyone, you wouldn't even be able to do this in the software, but of course you can because the world doesn't revolve around people who can't read a fucking two-axis chart.

It also prevents duplicate spending or altering of events in chronological order. In America, we don't have the issue of having too many votes, but India had that problem as their voting that year was nearly 100%. It's possible to request more than one ballot in America, but never ever have votes outnumbered the number of eligible voters as a whole. 
Cheaper to run over Bitcoin blockchain than it costs to manage a database. 
Voting is done state-by-state with several voting systems making it difficult for people moving from one state to another to even vote in federal elections, but NO STATE is going to be willing to foot the bill in having separated federal and state elections. 
That "oops, we forgot to count a box" that happened in Florida would be prevented. Missing ballots definitely do happen. It happened this year. 
The biggest issue blockchain would solve is of people applying to rescind their vote, which you can do in some states for early voters and people who voted for a candidate that has withdrawn. With today's voting systems, it's too difficult to let people change their votes in another state because their candidate is no longer valid. Much easier to reissue spend power to the same digital address than to reissue another ballot than keep track of which votes are which. That's why some states don't allow it. 
There's desire to centralize the presidential election, but fear that a central authority could tamper results is a use case for a single system to still be technically distributed. 
Maybe read case studies on why companies are already in business doing this. Works well for keeping track of real-estate assets as well. Especially in cultures with real estate is passed down without government. India and Hawai'i are perfect use cases to manage exchange of real property.

He's so wrong on American politics it's hard to know where to start, but he totally side-stepped conservatism and state rights. States have and cam continue to make laws and enforce anti-blockchain policies. Trump is NOT going to be pro-blockchain because he's hellbent on being able to seize property for the sake of ✌️️National Security✌️️and Christie just vetoed a law to force state police to list seized property. Property seizures are a large part of police budgets across the country. Literally everything he said about American politics is WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. Do I think Clinton would've been progressive to blockchain technology like she said? Nope. Trump won't, either. Bitcoin insiders is nice, but as you can see, the storyline is nothing but National Security and Bitcoin is inherently a threat to what that means to our government. Also, there's currently no economic uncertainty here. The Dow is up 600 pts. Bubble territory? Absolutely. Naïveté? Sure, but not uncertainty. Governments not being able to take property from someone will NEVER be coveted in America. Trump is NOT a libertarian. He's playing to moral conservatives. If anything, Bitcoin will go up due to increased property seizures and inevitable scandals.

@_date: 2017-02-28 14:44:08


Ummm... the majority of retailers. And not all businesses who accept Bitcoin through Bitpay immediately convert to dollars. The option is there to leave it in Bitcoin which I'm certain some businesses decide to do. I'm sure Overstock doesn't. They're selling their company shares via blockchain. Not totally loving HOW he's doing that, but the idea that all these companies are handling Bitcoin like a hot potato is false.

Bitcoin is not haram. Currency exchange is haram. If you buy Bitcoin at $500 and you sell it for $700, that's haram. Buying at $500 and selling/using at the same rate OR buying something priced in Bitcoin  is halal. 
Had this conversation with someone from high school. One week he's talking about how sinful the situation is in Venezuela for their currency inflation to cause people to work harder for the same goods and then when I'm posting and talking about the Bitcoin price, he's crying Michael Jordan. Sorry, bub.

You still don't get it. Technology makes transporting water to places possible also. In my state, if you collect too much fresh water, you can be fined or taxed. The rain in some places isn't even clean and you can't legally put rain barrels or even a bowl on public or private property. Clean water is not free when somebody somewhere is paying. Air is free. That might be the only thing left. Anything that can sustain life has intrinsic value.

Blockchain doesn't solve everything. It's certainly not going to help PayPal, but to say that blockchain is only good for crypto is false. Some solutions will need to have their own blockchain and some can run on Bitcoin, but there are solutions that are already being worked on. Nobody is saying blockchain is the best solution, but it's certainly A solution to voting. Would've been great if blockchain was a thing back in the day so music/movie companies could've tried to use it for DRM so people can sell their digital music instead of that strange era we had.

Don't think wealth would be the only factor. Iran isn't poor, but I don't think he'll start a war there. Let's back up and remember that Presidents don't have the lawful power to declare war. This means that he'll do it with his big mouth and we'll be struck first, or congress will declare war. China's too big to go to war in Chinese theatre, but it doesn't matter. Congress will never declare war on China unless they strike first. If they do, it'll likely be on water.  It'll also be about power struggles over land. Regardless, If North Korea's nuclear testing triggers their super volcano Paektu, we'll all be fucked anyway by suffocation and/or climate change.

Without Segwit I think we're still looking at $1300 this year. Bitcoin is undervalued as it is. 
I think this is a good place to vent this. How the fuck did ZCash have a bull run up to $6000 and not Bitcoin? What the actual fuck!? People really had more faith in that than Bitcoin?!? What were they thinking? Do I wish I would've pumped and dumped? Sure. I'm not saying it's a shit coin, but Bitcoin is tried and true. So anybody who thinks Bitcoin isn't already worth at LEAST $2500 right now with all its applications and institutional buy-in is being obtuse. Without all this regulatory bullshit, Bitcoin would be up to $5,000 by now WITHOUT segregated witness even in spite of Mt. Gox and Bitfinex. 
Anyway, back to the subject. I'm really not banking on the EFT, but if it did get approved, I'd sell to put in the EFT for my Roth to hold for retirement and avoid the tax on gains later if that's an option. 
Do I have an unreasonable faith in Bitcoin? Perhaps. But I'm putting my money where my mouth is. So, yeah. $1300 regardless. $1500 with Segwit. With EFT, God knows, but I fully expect to be rich.

I was, in fact, thinking of DigitalNote, which is merge mined among other coins. You're getting WAY off the point here with assumptions. 
First, I'm comparing the blockchain to current scantron-era voting machines and districts calling without completely counting etc. Same argument can be made for a piece of paper. The analogy that a presidential election is worth more than Bitcoin is an argument for the "when". It's not an argument against "why". The collective value of paper and voting machines is certainly not $19 billion. 
Second, like I mentioned before, America isn't the only country holding elections. Some countries or states have foregone having elections at all because it's too expensive. Blockchain is not expensive. Calling for a recount in America even costs a million dollars. 
I stand by that blockchain would be a better solution than what we have after having a woman changing votes and 2 people who voted in two states. Again. Other governments and businesses have different voting problems than we have.

Not create a reason. They wait for the market to show signs that it's not a good idea. 
For instance, a company files an S-1 and then 6 mos later the CEO is indicted on fraud charges. If they had approved because everything looked fine 3 mos ago, they'd have made a bad decision.

Yes. You would't get a 1 MB transaction from a single address. The only way to get a transaction that size is across several addresses. I don't even think 1mil Bitcoin on one address would cause a 1 MB transaction. Even so, to get that many BTC on one address means you re-used it several times in which case you should've been deservingly hacked by then for exposing your private key that many times.

You jumped in here asking how it wasn't true that Circle stopped dealing with Bitcoin. I gave you a link and also still buy my Bitcoin through Circle.

You almost got the point. 
Issuance of debt against Bitcoin is outside of the Bitcoin system. 
Issuance of debt against fiat is a subsidiary of the fiat system. If you DON'T issue debt against it, the system fails. 
That's the problem people have with fiat. You cannot separate debt from fiat. While the inflation, I agree, is totally transparent, it's an estimation at best. The fed has no way of knowing exactly how much money is in circulation before printing more to pay debts.

I'm not sure what purpose it serves to give an estimate all the way up to the point that you receive a totally different rate especially since the pending deposit says nothing about an estimate. The funds still haven't been deducted, by the way. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is up $90. If I don't like the rate and want my money back in my checking account, it'll take a whole week to 10 days at this pace. Considering the offer, I'll leave the transaction there and not submit a ticket for cancellation, but this is really cumbersome for currency exchange. Even fiat can have some relatively wild swings in 5 days.

Absolute Truth. That's why Jihan is asking miners to wait for 75%. However, they need more nodes than they have to support that many miners. They have 742 Nodes to Core's 5354. It's not happening.

Of course it's not happening. They don't have the hash power and they don't have the efficiency to mine blocks according to the numbers I've seen. If it happens, it would be nasty for BTC for a month unless new money comes in with investment into mining farms. It would be nasty for BU for years. Big blocks with no transactions means nothing. It would be accepted literally NOWHERE at the retail level. 
I personally plan to mine at a loss and not transact on the BU network after the fork. For BTC, it would be the equivalent of miners quitting and a price drop provided strong replay protection. I don't care what they do over there, honestly. I'm here for Bitcoin which is in the hands of the Core team.

Why not just do Bitpay? People pay you with a credit card and it goes straight to Bitcoin at your request. Of course there are fees at your end and there's no Bitcoin evangelism necessary, but it's very streamlined and you get Bitcoin at the Bitstamp rate, which is almost always lower than Coinbase.

34% reporting is a poll. That's it. That's all. It's not randomly selected, so if shmiff. Raising your hand doesn't mine blocks. I support SegWit. How many blocks have I mined? 0. Raised hands don't fork chains. Blocks do.

The fact that there are more miners mining with BU software to get Roger Ver's subsidy but will support Segwit than there are Core miners that support BU was obviously not considered in your "analysis".

Oh, boy. Your history is worse than I thought. Africans weren't the only ones forced into slavery and it wasn't confined to any time period. 
Debt breeds a ripe environment for slavery. Yup. Yup. Yup. Tripling down!! Especially when you consider that most slaves in America (since you can't seem to comprehend slavery elsewhere) were financed- debt creating a ripe environment for slavery creating more debt. Racism was invented to reinforced the institution of slavery, not the other way around. You're the one getting emotional.

Well, the issue is the IRS is already having trouble enforcing tax laws with blockchain analysis, so we're back to what should be coined the "war on drugs problem". Do we legalize it and get some taxes? Or do with try to control and suppress the population? If they make Bitcoin the enemy, they won't get any taxes and Bitcoin will chew into the USD like a rabid dog. Then, El Chapo and a bunch of nerds will be living off what could've been their spoils. If they play nice with Bitcoin, people with invested interest will advance the technology and the tax money will flow. They're weighing beating us and joining us. They know they can't beat us, so they're suppressing Bitcoin as much as possible until they can wager some leverage without getting swallowed by technology.

"Individual balance states are enforced using real bitcoin transactions whose broadcast on the blockchain is deferred until a later date, and enforced through time-enforced commitments bonded on-chain." ~ Christian Decker
"[I]n a payment channel, those signed transactions are not broadcast until the participants want the channel to stop operating. Signed but unbroadcast transactions are exchanged using direct, peer-to-peer communication, and held like redeemable receipts by the participants.
To use Lightning, two participants, Alice and Bob, create an initial transaction on the blockchain for $20, where each party has $10 of the value.
This initial allocation can then be updated, such that Alice then has $5 of the total $20 value, and Bob has $15, and so on. When the participants have finished transacting with each other, the most recently exchanged transaction signature is broadcast to the network, finalizing the movement of the funds in the channel—some to one party and (if any remain) some back to the other." ~ Elizabeth Stark

Could be a couple weeks or less, but unless they have a crystal ball to know what the market will look like the day it's approved, that paperwork isn't ready yet. They also would need to make sure they're in compliance and such. They have to get shareholder approval on the final prospectus and file that, too. It can take up to a month.

I agree, but what really matters is who's mining blocks at a given time and starts mining blocks Core doesn't accept. That's the definition of the fork. The network doesn't need clear majority, but it does need to be for an extended period because the part being left out of this discussion is if BU fucks this up, they'll have a useless fork of a bunch of orphaned blocks or quite possibly more than one chain. Have you looked at how many nodes are running BU? The numbers are laughable. No way they can fork with a few hundred nodes even with 70% hash power.

No. First you get an initial decision from the SEC. If the decision is a no, the filer is notified when they can petition for a hearing for a de novo review. If the 'no' is affirmed, it becomes a final answer. I don't see any initial decisions in the EDGAR system.

This has absolutely no bearings on the COIN ETF approval. This is regarding a compliance issue in regards to notifying customers about a company's non-compliance status of listed indexes and to give a certain time (45 days, I believe) to come into compliance. For instance, a company who's listed needs to have it's papers and shit together at all times. If it's not, shareholders could lose money and the ETF provider (BATS) needs to stay on top of them. The issue that seems to have been raised in the comments was "ok, and what's BATS gonna *do* about it?" I didn't read the original rule, but it's about compliance of companies listed on BATS.

One thing I absolutely hate in this sub is when people downvote comments and posts and they clearly don't know what the fuck they're talking about. 
This comment was downvoted, but it's correct. I took a moment to read 14.11 and one of the requirements is the fund has to be valued at at least $75 million. The twins are listing $100 million in bitcoin for COIN. If Bitcoin falls 25%, BATS, but 14.11 has to delist them. In this event, Winklevii would have 45 days to submit a plan to remedy the problem and a 3rd party would valuate the asset portfolio. 
If we delist Bitcoin after every China ban or if there's a hack, we're gonna be doing a disservice to Bitcoin. It also discussed making technical changes to the rules to be consistent across assets. 
It certainly looks like this rule change was intended to ripen BATS for cryptocurrency. 
Without this rule, COIN would be delisted after China's first cup of Orange Pekoe before their meeting even started.

Really? Because this was the case with VerizonFios having territory, but not allowing competing markets where they didn't have infrastructure to offer FiOs. Verizon was forced to give up territory instead of forcing customers to accept the slow implementation of fiber optics. Not a mid-size public company, certainly a different technology. 
Walmart sued Visa for requiring them to store signatures for chip-imbedded cards because it would be too database storage and record keeping required. Visa tried to counterclaim that Walmart would deny them transaction fees if a customer couldn't remember their pin and the court denied it. Also not a mid-level company, but again. There's precedent over forcing a company to change technology.

I don't mean reducing fees. It's just sometimes I'm sending funds for personal purposes and not buying something and would rather send 1 BTC even including the fee and not have .00000025 BTC left in the wallet. The fee itself in the wallet is actually fine. I have never had a stuck transaction like people complain about here. 
Additionally, I had previously contacted BitPay and a ticket was opened regarding using BTC denomination rather than USD to reload the BitPay card. I've updated and the option has totally been removed. That's really disappointing. ��

The graph shows SegWit-supporting blocks mined declining for the last 144 blocks. This is only inclusive of the miners who actually declared support for a certain protocol. 
Over the last 1000 blocks, this isn't the case if you ignore signaling. Core-mined blocks are increasing. Everybody hasn't even voted, so that trend is not indicative of a fork. 
Let me offer another example:
100 people have a vote and 60 make their votes publicly known over the course of a week. 
Of that 60...
-5 vote on the 1st 4 days and tell everyone they voted BU; on the 5th day, there are 8. (These are BU-mined blocks)
-5 vote on the 1st 5 days and tell everyone they voted SegWit 
-1 says they will vote for SegWit, but on day 1, they filled out a BU ballot with intention to change their vote (miners that mine BU blocks because they want Roger Ver's 10% bonus, but don't want a hard fork) Goddamn swing voters. This is Florida. 
-4 are running Core and intend to vote SegWit, but haven't voted today (These are miners who are having a bad day and didn't mine any blocks)
So right now, we have an official vote 29 BU vs 25 SegWit. We have no idea what the other 40 will decide, but all of them are running Core. We can only speculate based on their political party (the client they're running; Core or BU). For the most part, everyone running BU has made a decision and voted, but 40 people from the Core party haven't said a word yet they continue identify as a member of the core party. BU needs 51% to win. They need people to switch parties and explicitly vote for them. These 40 people continue to increase party support (The are increasingly mining core blocks). 
So votes (mined blocks which happen literally by chance with odds that increase by hash power) are what we're counting. By the way, that number is now 38.9 for BU vs 27.1 SegWit of the nodes that explicitly voted. 
TL;DR There are many, many more blocks mined by Core miners and at increasing rates than there are miners signaling core. BU miners don't just have to beat SegWit. They have to beat all of Core in MINED BLOCKS by 51%. Right now they're less than 34% because of the miners mining BU to get Roger's bonus. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:17:02
You look happy. Congratulations 
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:33:53
I don't think so if they're running compatible software, but that also doesn't stop Core miners from staging a 51% attack on BU. Hard fork benefits nobody but miners and not even that much. Miners need users to have fees and exchanges have already decided to treat Core as BTC. That means those transactions stay on core as the longest chain and BTU is essentially accepted nowhere.

First of all, I will never, ever approve of a hard fork of Bitcoin. Evah. 
Second, if this debate was going to be politicized, it should've gone all the way. Instead of being a lesson in being greedy for fees in haste, BU turns back to a technical argument with "I wouldn't have exposed YOUR bug. Why are you being mean to me?" After all this shit talk about Bitcoin from roger ver comparing it to a coin with a fraction of the daily volume is ridiculous. Suddenly when there's a bug in the code, you find your technical compass. 
Third, if miners wanna do less work and get more fees they need to go back to church and get saved. Bitcoin is not here to make miners rich. It's here to smash fiat monopolies and decentralize currency and restore trade to its former glory when fiat was gold standard and credit and trust was community reputation and not authoritarian government. Let's save the quest for supreme prosperity for after we've accomplished the goals. It's not like there will be no profit in the meantime. 
Having said that, the way to prevent ISIS is to come to a consensus of what makes each code a success or failure. Bitcoin Unlimited is already losing here especially after yesterday- a year-long bug and high fees. While I was never totally in love with SegWit, BU has been problematic before just yesterday. If programmers agree that this is political, have a convention and a live quorum and sew informed public opinion. If programmers deny that it's politicized, backtrack to Core and make incremental, minor changes in areas we all agree on instead of these major overhauls. Everybody wants larger blocks. Do that first and see how we feel. Miner, remind yourselves that it's supposed to be decentralized. Nobody wants another authoritarian currency. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you spent all day killing infidels and didn't pray even once, you've gotten off the point, don't you think?

The rule being quoted all over the place saying if a date falls on a non-working day that the deadline is extended to the following business day is for when an entity need to submit something to the SEC, not for when the SEC makes a ruling. 
This rule is used for correspondence TO the SEC to avoid undue burden of a shortened deadline or requiring employees to work on weekends to do the filing of whatever is due to the SEC. If the government owes something, they're expected to do it the day before or the day of the deadline. Government doesn't get to play the undue burden card. It'll be done between now a Saturday. 
Rule 160. Time Computation.
(a) Computation. In computing any period of time prescribed in or allowed by these Rules of Practice or by order of the Commission, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal legal holiday (as defined in Rule 104), in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays shall be excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or allowed is seven days or less, not including any additional time allowed for service by mail in paragraph (b) of this rule. If on the day a filing is to be made, weather or other conditions have caused the Secretary's office or other designated filing location to close, the filing deadline shall be extended to the end of the next day that is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a Federal legal holiday.
(b) Additional Time For Service by Mail. If service is made by mail, three days shall be added to the prescribed period for response.

Yes, she did. She was a child as in 10 years old. You need to understand the difference between indentured servitude, slavery and chattel slavery. Maybe figure that out while you're looking up Eli Whitley. It matters because you brought it up. Sam invented the cotton gin. Several historians agree on this since slaves could not own patents and their masters owned their intellectual property. 
Slavery exists (yes, here in the US. We have a serious human trafficking problem with people being smuggled here and being forced to work in agriculture and other otherwise legal industries) because everybody didn't progress and somebody somewhere is benefitting. 
Does that make you a slave? Depends. Were you beaten? Raped? Did you get paid every time? I don't claim to know you like you just claimed to know me. 
Like I said, if every sovereignty completely paid off its debts, you'll be left with forced labor. That's what happens when there's power, but no money.

First, let me get to the purpose of your question. I'm going to predict another extension. Just wanna get that out of the way here. There will be no yes/no this year. That's my guess. I'm about 70/30 on an extension vs a final answer.

One way or the other, I feel like this is Craig's fault, though. If Gavin put his reputation on the line, the best thing would've been to either prove it or be silent, but my problem with that whole debacle is that Craig was taking steps to patent blockchain technology, told a journalist he *would* prove cryptographically that it was him, and then backed off with a weird letter saying how he doesn't want the attention. Whether Gavin was bamboozled or not, Craig put him in that position. Satoshi or not, that was a dick move.

It would make more sense to just not transact rather than hurt vulnerable people in the system. The thought of leaving Venezuelans and Greeks with $300 Bitcoin is painful.

Uphold is only 3%, I think. Their rate is usually lower than Coinbase, also. Some people have had verification issues though. CEX.io is 3.5%, but they're only in select states. I'd ask before going through the hassle.

Here's my conspiracy theory on this. It was too risky to not patch AND if they notify BU miners that there's a problem and they go back to Core, there's a higher possibility that SegWit can activate while the BU nodes are offline.

I'm pretty sure what you're saying is wrong. Fees stay the same when it needs to be included in a block by a miner with signature. However, transactions can be processed through a node without a fee. Again. Segwit is ready. Code for hard fork is not. We can literally Segwit TODAY.

YES!!!!! So we have votes good enough to do nothing until BU overhauls all of Core. Good luck with that. ...and they only have 750 nodes to confirm their transactions. God knows how long it'll take to get the satisfactory number of confirmations retailers want. That's like an apartment without a kitchen- illegal in most states. Core Original is winning with 64%. The majority have decided to do nothing. Even if SegWit and BU joined forces to hard fork, they still lose and we do nothing. If BU joined forces with SegWit to activate, we do nothing. After over a year, we have zero consensus. 
This is FUD.

RFID and database used to be the thing. The issue with this is will be the same with blockchain- businesses will still sell the product under the table to discount retailers or partners and don't want the manufacturer to know either because it violates their terms or because they're negotiating on behalf of another client.
This would be good for pharmaceuticals, which is currently done with qr and mainframe at IMS and Symphony- the two big data Giants in pharma because it's a complete madhouse, but again, retailers don't want pharma companies and their competitors to know who they sell re-sell their drugs to.
The trick here will be getting people to use the system at all times. From personal experience, they won't. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 05:10:03
That whole master node paradigm leaves the network vulnerable to certain attacks. Also, the reward system creates a toxic relationship between master nodes and between master nodes and the price of the coin. When a master node leaves the network, it immediately inflates the market. Any system that gives too much power to miners/masters isn't decentralized enough to be true to cryptocurrency. I thought Dash was a great coin until   I realized the coins spent on nodes were still a part of the available coins. I thought it was like Factom where once factoids are converted to EC, it can't be converted back. It just doesn't make mathematical sense. While bitcoin doesn't hold up coins in this way for miners, the same ideology that miners will control the value of the coin is counterproductive.

AntPool can only speak for their equipment. They cannot guarantee hash power. If I mine on AntPool and I decide I don't support BU, I'll take my hash power elsewhere. AntPool isn't wholly owned hash power. They can't tell miners what to do. By the way, 44% has dropped to 40.3% as I'm writing. The numbers don't mean what you think they mean from the get go.

Then we have different interpretations of what the question is. OP asked if you could see the transactions inside the channel, not if Alice paid Bob. My answer to whether you can see transactions that occur inside the channel is "Sometimes, yes." If I want to settle a payment, my understanding is I can put it on chain to get my funds, but keep the channel open, but it's not just open/close all the time. I didn't say you knew details or existence of transactions not published, but transactions *can* be published to update states without closing the channel. I posted my sources to show where I was getting info from since OP, ya know, might want to read it.

Hashrate and blocks mined are two different things. You can have the lower hash rate and wind up finding more blocks if you're lucky to pick the right lottery numbers.

If Coinbase is hacked, even if they don't have direct access to the coins, there's enough information about you on their servers outside the blockchain to be a major issue. I just feel like it's more likely that OPs phone is compromised. I have a friend whose ex is using a Stingray to grab her SMSs and send them back to her as screenshots to show her that he can see them. She's on iMessage and FaceTime until further notice. I wouldn't be surprised if in the past few weeks, 2FA came through SMS for either of you. This usually happens when people use a google number for 2FA, which is a terrible idea. To count as a second factor, the eggs have to be in separate baskets.

See Satoshi's post on incremental changes. Like I said before, I did a lot of research before buying Bitcoin. I wasn't part of any forums. I just read and read and picked a wallet and exchange and bought. Probably tumbled my coins more than I needed to, but I learned to be paranoid and cautious from research. I learned that hard forks are risky. Then I saw what happened to Ethereum. One of my early posts here was about Core getting their ducks in a row before a hard fork is forced. I was downvoted and told it was never gonna happen. We can have a 2MB block with a soft fork and it's safer. I'm pretty sure Satoshi advocated for incremental change. Why people who want bigger blocks are ignoring that, I don't know.

If this ever happens to anyone, they should ask for the transaction to be void and for the deposit to be returned. Banks are obligated to give a receipt for a transaction. Otherwise, there's no way for the depositor to know the teller didn't just pocket the funds. Be diligent. Credit Unions are not banks operating under National Association, but they operate under NCUA. If a receipt is refused by the manager, call the NCUA and refuse to leave until they do.

I'd activate Segwit because my fees would actually stay the same with more transactions in the same number of blocks but with a noticeable improvement to the network and the users. If transactions were faster, more people would use it and I could let go of the illusion of power with faith that Bitcoin will become more normalized into everyday transactions.

FYI, iCloud has 2FA enabled by default, but *TEXT* messages do not. The only way I could tho k that what you're suggesting is possible is if you used the same password for something else as Coinbase AND they had your phone number and register Authy or other 2FA via SMS. SOMETHING else has to be hacked. Think of other places that you use that same password. My password for Coinbase looks like a wallet address and used nowhere else. I doubt very seriously Coinbase entertained a claim for inability to answer 2FA. That's Crypto 101. Only banks do dumb shit like that.

I have been emailing them back and forth about the fact that the app (and the website) does not articulate fees properly. When I buy from USD wallet, it says "Fee: $0.00" and then I get an email with a different price. Since I sent them the last set of screenshots, they haven't replied and I do want my money back. Here's the workaround. 
GDAX.com is the Coinbase exchange where you can make trades for free. Log in with your Coinbase credentials and trade with other Bitcoin holders with SIGNIFICANTLY lower fees- 0%-.25% fees, but you MUST make "Limit" trades. Send money to your USD wallet and buy on the exchange, not from Coinbase.

You know a long time ago, animals had their own court. If you wanted to build a house in the forest that would displace animals, you'd have to take the animals to court for the right to imminent domain. In fact, animals have won in court and their human accusers sentenced to death. Since, animals have been deemed property so somebody could shoot your dog, throw you $500 and move on with life. I'm giving this extreme example because this is a pivotal moment and governments are known for instilling ridiculous laws out of sloth for understanding something and to shorten the court's time in mitigating it. That's what happened with Napster- kids losing their parents their houses for downloading music we now get for free in exchange for commercials paying a fraction in royalties on Slacker.

America had a very different culture then. It was selective socialism. The FDA even ran campaigns to tell people what foods to avoid to help support the troops as they needed the high-fat diet more than civilians. A lot of race wars re-ignited over polyester. Clothing is one of the main status symbols for Blacks and Asians and when they refused to stop wearing big cloths, there were always clashes. Wearing lots of fabric wasn't really ever a status symbol for White American MEN, so it wasn't much for them to give up. 
Again, Americans have near sight and short memories. Historically, if you do socialist things and say it will preserve capitalism, lots of Americans will vote for you and they will continue to vote for people like you and not be able to crystallize WHY into a sentence. 
Americans also still think you have to remove the doors from a refrigerator before throwing it out so children don't get locked inside.

When you send a sepa or wire, the fiat is converted to USD. The Bitstamp exchange is USD only regardless of what you actually deposit. Your money goes through fiat-to-fiat exchange FIRST.

If you're trying to get the 1% cash back, you probably won't because Coinbase will process as a pinless debit. Should be no issues. Though I've not used with Coinbase yet, I've had the card for about 4 -5 years and the only time it operates differently is when withdrawing at an ATM.

Not in America. There's been several cases where EFT has been reversed here for bank error and improper transfer.

I don't understand how money laundering is a crime, but invoking the 5th amendment right to not be compelled to self-incrimination exists. Laundered money doesn't hurt anyone beyond the crime already committed. The comparison COULD be made for covering up a murder, sure, but it would be a weak argument.

Someone could try to heat the package to open it, but this glue seems like the kind that gets stickier and messy with heat and it's a cardboard box, so it'll still tear.

To clarify, bitcoins stay on an address until you move them. All HD wallets, Ledger, Trezor, Copay and otherwise issue new addresses once a balance is received. It's up to YOU to use that new address and not to reuse the old ones. Bitcoin will never be transferred from one address to another automatically. That's called 'spending' even though both addresses belong to one wallet/seed.

I think it would go up. After Sandy, there were no credit cards or other electronic funds transfers due to massive outage even though they had electricity and data at the store, wherever the database was didn't. Bitcoin doesn't have that problem. It was the same during the mass outage of Aug 2003. Phones are mobile. You couldn't even order online and pick it up. With bitcoin being decentralized, some miner will have power and can mine the transaction. I think it'll be a wake up call for folks who don't have any.

1) That was NOT stimulus. It was a loan that was repaid. 
2) Oh, that's just the beginning AND that's Trump's only argument. He doesn't have the lowest unemployment in 17 years like he says he does. Yes, it is narrow. Tell him that. None of this even matters because we're still on Obama's economic policy. These are arguments against his lies, not how I would frame the conversation at all. He doesn't have a budget to have a deficit.  
3) I knew it wouldn't be long until you brought up Hillary. Never fails. Ever. Trump lies. He's doesn't just exaggerate.

Only if there's a run on a bank would I expect a rise in price. Otherwise, I can't imagine Americans selling dollars for bitcoin in a crisis. Most people are not financially literate enough to understand how fiat can lose value and will favor cash. The others who do understand inflation will favor gold first. I don't think the price will change at all unless China gets involved in which case, I expect major increase.

Honestly, I used to tumble my coins somewhere in the dark web every time I switched wallet because I knew all my transactions would tie together by sending all coins to one address and I wasn't using core to pick and choose which addresses to empty, but bitcoin was $500 then and my main purpose was privacy and boycotting banks, not really investment. Tumbling $X,XXX in bitcoin is another matter and I can't recommend that right now with Alphabay, Hansa, and BTC-e all going down in a month's time. Best way is to swap with a person of course, but we don't know what logs and such will be kept. I say wait for the market to adjust. Somebody out there will do something in the interest of privacy. Just keep in mind that it's not inherently private.

Gold will go up first and then Bitcoin will get the spillover. The benefit to being the " country in the world" is faith in the financial system. 
Young people most likely to trust Bitcoin will wait it out expecting the market to fully recover in 5 years, but put money in Bitcoin as a hedge especially if they plan to travel. These are middle class people who can afford to leave their investments where they are long term. 
Old people are the ones who will panic. Retirement funds they need to pull out soon can't wait 5 years, but they're not about to put funds they need now in an even riskier system, so they buy gold and continue panicking. 
If anybody got out early before the slide became the crash and they're not retirement age, they're going to be where the bump comes from and I suspect these people are priced in mostly because they bought with Inauguration Day. This group includes me. 
There are some young people who have unfeathered faith in the current stock market right now. After the failed Trumpcare bill, the market slid, but not nearly as much as it should have. It should've set the tone for imminent trade bill failures. I fully expect the market to go crazy at the first failed trade bill because that's what the bump in January was all about- trade bills and less restrictions on business. 
I don't think it'll translate much for Bitcoin because of the "who". The ones who are likely to invest in Bitcoin are on the stock market's teet and won't have the good sense to get out TO have money to buy Bitcoin and make additional risk.

Canceled Coinbase yesterday after having Circle for less than a week. 
I connected my PayPal debit and the fee is 2.9% which is the same as Coinbase when you consider the Circle price is the same as Coinbase with the fee. 
I get withdrawals to debit cards next day. 
I get withdrawals to checking in about 2 days. 
$3,000/wk limit.
I buy from them when I need Bitcoin now and Glidera when I have 5 days to wait and get it a little cheaper. I wish Circle would display rates. That's my only complaint. 
@_date: 2016-09-11 22:34:16

You would log into chrome in a different window with a gmail account also registered with your Apple ID, and enable continuity.

I'm a stickler for movie details and I was wondering 1) if there were no upper and lowercase, why that Enigma was so hard to crack. The answer is the enigma Turing solved was not a 4-wheel machine in Imitation Game. It was an 8-wheel machine manufactured by the Germans. 2) were the Germans really that stupid to salt every message with the same 5 letters and "tweet" the weather at the same exact time every day. Yes. They were exactly that dumb. They didn't follow instructions to use 5 random letters. 
Then I got to thinking. Why can't motherfuckers just follow fucking difuckingrections?! I can just imagine the look on Nazi IT Guy's face. If he couldn't get motherfuckers to follow instructions, I can stop being so hard on myself. My country's sovereignty doesn't depend on this  Nintex Workflow being executed properly, so fuck it. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 23:35:11
No. you cannot connect Circle to send direct from your own wallet. 
What people seem to not be grasping here is 
1) Circle let's you use Bitcoin to send FIAT. The circle balance cannot be kept in Bitcoin. 
2)Blocktrail wallet allows you to send BITCOIN through text message. 
NO IDEA why this is getting this much coverage in crypto subs.

When the second person makes a deposit to your buy order into the first person's account, they release the bitcoin and when the second person shows proof they made a deposit, it won't be valid for your account.

I like it, but improvements are coming so there will be more to like. I protect my FB acct with it, too. One thing I don't like is when you disconnect, although you can't send/receive, you can see the wallet and if you reconnect it fast enough, it doesn't ask for the pin again. I'd like the option to change that and Trezor has gotten enough questions to consider it. If you're worried about theft, you really should activate the uber secure passphrase option so you can hide your wallet and hopefully that won't be the one you have open at the moment when shit goes down because the wallet will still show on the screen. There's a trillion things to like about it, but I'd like it to be like Tails. When I unplug it, I'm not here. **poof** The interface is very nice. Also, the micro USB is a lil deep, so you HAVE to use the cable in the box. The Trezor 2 is supposed to allow saving files. If I can get Ubuntu on it, I'll upgrade. Otherwise, it'll have to give me more than that. I bought an extra black one if you want to buy it for the same $99. Otherwise, shipping from Czech Rep was a little over 2 weeks.

I disagree. This is fruit of the poisonous tree.

Except Bitcoin is not classified as currency, but property and therefore not an MSB. OP would have to be trading one currency for another. If that's the case, every store with a register is an MSB.

Federal judges have already disagreed. FinCEX is a regulatory body like IRS. The create CODE AND REGULATION, NOT laws. Judge has already rejected and one case is pending. YOU ARE delusional. 
Driving drunk is not a crime. It's a violation of motor vehicle regulations. Your problem is you don't know the difference between laws and regulations.

Actually, I'm saying he was more likely immoral than criminal because of the what they had on him and how they got it. A significant amount of crime could not have even taken place without the Secret Service agent. If nothing else, please read the Prosecutor's brief. 
Here's the Prosecutor's brief on appeal of why he doesn't deserve a new trial. 
I believe he does because the entire trial, none of the jurors or Ross knew the secret agent was working for Silk Road. See page 64. 
They didn't reveal that he was a secret agent until after the trial. 
They totally fucked over his 6th Amendment right to confrontation. I've won on appeal in Superior Court on these grounds twice. I'm confident he'll get a new trial.

Trezor does when you create with Copay and join for sure.

College electricity was included for me. Check your lease. High School? No, I wouldn't do that.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:42:17
Trezor is a hardware wallet. If you're trying to use an existing wallet, you can use Copay, I think since you have 2/3 keys.

You can stop having it when you start understanding how case law works. If federal court says Bitcoin is not money, then it's not money. 
Federal law also makes it illegal to deface a flag. See how that works? FinCEN isn't the legislative branch. Not how US government works. 
If it was illegal, everyone broke the law to buy it in the first place.

You can import your public address to copay yo just watch and not be able to spend from your Trezor. Then you can see inputs and generate fresh addresses.
