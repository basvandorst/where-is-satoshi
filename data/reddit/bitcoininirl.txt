 , it's a 100% Irish focused one to help the local bitcoin community, community and travellers coming to Ireland know what's where. Also, we're actively finding companies to put on the map, so we already have triple the amount that Coinmap has. 
 I had bought Google Map Engine Pro as part of another project, mapping the Irish Games Industry, so thought why not :)

I don't say that they accept Donedeal, but they do have donedeal listings for services, and a couple of mining rigs so that's why they're there. Buyandsell etc don't have any listings for bitcoin related stuff. I'll be breaking them out into different categories, but could probably just embed the search page and take them out of the map. 
What do you, and other people think? If someone selling though wants to set up their own dot while they're trying to sell it, we could do that too. ie see who has a rig up the road, go see it in person, and then make an offer for it.

Hi all, just reposting with the correct link as there was a typo!
We are putting together a map directory of businesses accepting Bitcoin for goods and services across Ireland. We currently have 29 businesses, ranging from web services, electronics, goods, services, food, accommodation and pints, that accept Bitcoin.
If anyone on Reddit comes across ones not listed, please let us know!
