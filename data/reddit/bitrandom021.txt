Lucky for you, I suggest you sell the rest while there is still hype and value, it might crash to 0 anyday now, take away the money from the greater fool that buys from you. And don't look back and stay away from this scam.

Simple, you don't wanna be the last man out when this pyramid collapses. His stash only gets more valuable as more newbies throws money at it, when it gets exhausted everybody will start to cash out.

Yeah, a moon means better find a greater fool to sell your bitcoins so you can buy a house one day, what a joke!

If they're talking about how much money they or other people made, it is a sign of a bubble, and that's the cue to get out while you still can. I doubt they're talking about the technology anyway as that is boring as hell and it is almost useless for the common man.

Thanks to the fools that are buying bitcoin now at all time  high this schmuck's just funded a wedding and will continue to breed like rats...
To those just buying now, don't think you all can have the same profits as this guy! Someone must lose in order for others to gain something and you new guys that just bought in, are the new sacrifice!

Congrats for seeing through the smoke and finally got out of this scam. Enjoy the money from the fools that bought your coins and never look back! Don't be the greater fool again to buy from someone that wants out, let them lose money till this pyramid collapses.

And they say money doesn't buy happiness...
And to all the fools buying in now, you've just given this schmuck your hard earned cash. You've got in too late once you read stories like this, don't think you all can have the same profits as this guy! Someone must lose in order for others to gain something and you new guys that just bought in, are the new sacrifice!

LoL who would pay 1 million for something you can't even touch and is necessarily useless? You must be smoking something.
This is 20k max till the idiots buying bitcoin realize they're throwing cash out of something intangible and useless. Then it will crash and burn and nobody will touch this shit again.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:31:32
Well that's expected, they are gonna keep it to themselves. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:37:23
Never! People here will try to convince you anyways because they got in early and they want your money. This is a greater fools game, don't be that greater fool. Bitcoin is only worth what the next person is willing to pay for.

Buying back means he'll have to fund your house so you can sell your bitcoins back to him LoL, sorry he'll be stupid to buy back and be the greater fool to fund your bitcoin dream house.

Past does not equate future returns. You can say the same thing in 2011 when it was on single digits and ratio it to the current price, no way this is gonna go up 1000x or even 100x on the current price there will always be a ceiling.
And the money flowing doesn't come out of nowhere, early buyers are taking money away from the newcomers, and them hoping there will be a greater fool in future to buy their stuff for more expensive price. And when no one buys it price starts crashing and money goes out of the system. There will be a last man out and there will be a loser in this game!
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:04:20
Agree with this, better cash out while you're ahead and get out of this scam. In reality no one cares about this blockchain, decentralized bullshit, life was fine before it and will be fine without it. Most are only in here because of the massive price jump and wanna be the guy that multiplied his money 1000x or even a 100x, well guess what folks that's not gonna happen to you, you're just giving your money to the early buyers and hoping a greater fool buys yours! Eventually it gets saturated and everybody starts selling and crashing the price when they can't get a greater fool to bail them out of this scam!

Bitcoin sounds more like pyramid scheme with these "success stories". With early birds posting their "success".
Do you realize you newbie suckers buying in right now are what is funding this schmuck's house, hope you guys find a greater fool to sell your bitcoins, can't believe something intangible can make someone as rich the world is really full of idiots. 
As for me, I just multiplied my capital 10x this year, no need to hold this useless shit anymore, for you noobs to have the same profit right now, btc has to go to 150k which is just LoL. Thanks for the profits suckers I am outta here!
