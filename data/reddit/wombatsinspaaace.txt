It's worse than just the advertisements. 
BFL tried to get me to cancel a preorder for 10 of the 60GH/s units I placed in early January '13 with a single Monarch (ie replace a $13K order with a $5K order *with no refund*) Given the completely shit delivery schedule, I refused, got my miners late in September and managed to mine about 60 BTC. Anybody that took the exchange has been royally fucked... *twice.*

They'd likely feel about it the same way they felt about fiat currencies, in spite of bitcoin more closely resembling gold than typical fiat:
"**No state shall** enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit; **make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts**; pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility."

All the evidence points at there being a background here that is totally different than the publicly claimed issue (malleability.) 
The run might be a cover for a big theft by someone who held the keys, or a massive government intervention, or who knows. I'm pretty sure when the true story comes out it will be nothing like what Gox claimed initially. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:31:34
Whoosh. 
The founders' position on gold and silver being the monetary standard for the US and that fiat was not to be used is pretty well established, and those metals continued to be used for more than one hundred years after, save for the civil war crisis. The citation from the Constitution is evidence that the founders intended monetary metals and nothing else to be the basis of the financial system. Note that I didn't highlight the *coin money* part, but the *make anything but gold and silver payment* part.

I'll make a stab at it.
Gox is claiming it lost hundreds of thousands of coin to theft via transaction malleability, and people are finding addresses that were under Gox's control with hundreds of thousands of coins and no evidence of the trickle of losses malleability would result in. Instead, they're finding some addresses with movements of coins in large amounts immediately before Gox announces there is a problem.
TL;DR: Gox's explanation for the missing coins (malleability) is full of shit, and either Gox still has control of the coins or someone else has control of them and moved them in large blocks.

Yes, I think this was probably the trigger. $25K over a few months with no transaction larger than $5K pretty much screams "structuring" to the bank. OP can be assured the bank also filed one or more suspicious transaction reports (which mean nothing, but might result in extra scrutiny by the gov't.)

It's a long time (2140) but the reality is most bitcoins will be mined in just the next few years. 75% will be mined by the end of 2016, and 90% will have been mined by 2022. We're at ~56% right now.
@_date: 2013-10-20 20:14:17
I gave them the benefit of the doubt and kept mining the past couple days. After still no payouts, I pulled the plug and switched to a different pool. At this point I have to presume it's either lost money or it'll take a long time to see it, and it's not worth the risk for the extra few points 50BTC pays over other pools.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:07:04
More like one person selling bitcoins causing a stampede.
[Check out this transaction that seems to be one of the triggers](
@_date: 2013-10-15 16:51:43
This is true. I was in the middle of the BFL waitlist (basically January 1, 2013). Because I ordered early enough, I got the lower pricing (basically half of what they were charging in April) and all my units are the faster 60GH/s model -- so I did about as well as I could on the equipment. 
When all is said and done I'll get about 75% of what I paid out of the systems before they go into negative operating profit. *Definitely* a terrible investment. I should have stopped mining when my GPUs went unprofitable and just bought bitcoin instead.
@_date: 2013-10-15 06:30:13
It will leave the work to the hands that are most efficient/have lowest operating costs.
Someone with free power can mine indefinitely with positive operating profit. Others may be in an area with very low power costs, and they can either use the most efficient mining equipment to maximize operating profit, or continue to use older equipment to maximize ROI.
Long term the the system will likely concentrate mining among uses with the best hardware and/or lowest power costs. This doesn't necessarily mean a small number of hands, though it could.

That's the beauty of it -- the network will essentially end up self-regulating right around the break-even point. If there are fewer miners, the difficulty goes down and each miner earns more. 
So -- someone will always want to mine. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:11:23
During the free-fall I started cruising blockchain.info for big trades that might have set it off. Someone did a single 25K BTC ($25M+ USD at the time) transaction right before the biggest drop of the day if I'm reading the timestamps right. No wonder MtGox was having issues if that's the exchange it happened on.
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:26:14
I'm a miner with close to 1 TH/s capacity. 
All I have to say is WTF would you want to spend $3K on mining equipment that will be nearly worthless in a couple months and make less bitcoin in those two months than you can buy right now?
Seriously, there's almost no point in mining right now.
@_date: 2013-10-15 06:05:08
In my case, minimizing the losses on the mining equipment. I have 600 GH/s in capacity that won't ever pay for itself, but even with present difficulty increases and power, the size of the losses will decrease (based on my modeling) until about February, where turning the mining rigs on will actually increase my losses. 
If anyone wants 60 GH/s BFL boxes for XBT, I got 'em.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:00:05
Correct. All we know is that coincident with the start of the bigger drop of the day, this transaction took place. It could be a move between wallets, or a sweep of small sales into a single wallet, or someone dumping 25K bitcoins onto MtGox.
@_date: 2013-11-01 06:13:43
LOL: 
At the *least* negative ROI you're out $3,500 in March, 2014.
Take it from a miner with capacity in excess of this: it will **never** pay for itself. Not in a month, not in a year. At this point, even with free power it'll be ROI negative in 100 years.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:29:03
I wondered about that myself. It could be MtGox sweeping sales into a cold wallet, or it could be a single sale to them that they choked on.

A couple approaches to define a top, based on monetizing some world metrics across all BTC produced to date:
World Debt = $223T / 12M BTC = $18.6M USD per BTC
World GDP = $72T / 12M BTC = $6M USD per BTC
Total Gold = $6.9T / 12M BTC = $575,000 USD per BTC
Western Union transfers per year = $79B / 12M BTC = $6,583 USD/BTC
I don't actually believe we'll see anything like this unless there's an economic collapse specific to the USD. The higher the velocity (turnover) of bitcoin, the larger market it can support, so for example with Western Union it's easy to imagine the same 1M BTC churning through an economy 12X a year for the same effect. 
Personally I think $5K is a reasonable mid-term (next few years) cap. We're way overbought.
[This]( is a macro-based estimate. To save you reading, they say either $1M or zero per BTC long term.

I've been mining for a couple years. With a few exceptions at no time in the past year would I have been better off mining rather than buying bitcoins outright. With mining you have a hardware expense and electricity expense and you get your bitcoins slowly -- and as difficulty adjusts upwards (and it has been, rapidly) you get them even more slowly still.
My single greatest bitcoin-related regret is than back In January I invested in mining equipment upgrades rather than buying coins outright.
Trust me, skip the KnC units and just put the money directly into bitcoins, you'll be much better off and have none of the mining-related headaches of managing hosting and uptime while watching profits drop 30% every couple weeks.
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:57:05
This is pretty classic miner's fallacy. He's still better off buying. I'm a high-net-worther that's well above your 200K cutoff, and the time saving argument is bogus. The only reason my miners are online today is to minimize my loss on equipment investment -- around February it looks like I'll be pulling the plug and dumping mining forever. 
If he "wastes" his time *once* navigating exchanges, he can buy a block of 1000 BTC if he cares to do so, amortizing that time over each BTC, and have a low acquisition cost and no risk with respect to equipment security, downtime, etc. It will take more time unboxing and setting up a miner than it would to buy bitcoins.
The mining calculator at the genesis block isn't bad: 
You can't really say what "real time" mining costs are without factoring in equipment, long-term payout, etc. If you're just wondering how much power = 1 BTC, you can do that, but it leaves a *lot* out of the equation. The key ultimately will be where difficulty winds up, and if history is any guide, it will wind up right on top of the average power cost break-even.
TL;DR: **Take it from a miner, don't mine, and don't invest in mining equipment.**
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:18:07
You are **much** better off buying coins outright. I have well over $10K invested in pre-price-increase BFL rigs, and I'm generating just a little more than 0.5 BTC per day (it was 1.5 BTC per day just six weeks ago.) If you buy mining equipment it will be months at best before you'd see a positive ROI, and probably never.
The only reason I have positive ROI is due to the price increase of BTC. I'd have far more to show for my money had I bought BTC directly. (Indeed, at the time if I had done this I'd be up over $500K USD.)
Don't mine. Buy.
@_date: 2013-10-15 06:19:04
Mining rigs that have positive net operating profit generate more dollars per hour than power costs. Today, virtually all ASIC miners are net positive for *operating* costs. GPU miners are not except in places where power is free.
ROI is related to the cost of the machine and the operating profit. To my knowledge as of today all ASIC machines have an up-front cost that by most estimates is higher the the value of the bitcoins they will mine over their entire lifetime. In other words, they are negative returns on inventment, hence the OP's message.
From your description "machine with a large number of physical cores" it sounds like you're describing a PC or server CPU, or perhaps a GPU. It is possible to mine on a multicore machine, but the output of such mining would be trivially small amounts of bitcoin per day (think pennies or worse.)
The basics of mining aren't very difficult. You essentially install software such as "cgminer" on your PC, it locates appropriate hardware and configures it, and then you give it a web address, username and password to the mining pool of your choice. It them communicates with the mining pool to get work assignments to run on your hardware (which can be a CPU, GPU, FPGA or ASIC device.) It's pretty hands-off once you've put in those three bits of information. 
"Mining pools" are basically a coordinated group of miners that share their computation results and profits, since the odds of any one miner finding a block and getting the XBT reward are very low, by dividing the workload and sharing the reward in proportion you effectively get a guaranteed share of a very large virtual bitcoin-mining supercomputer's XBT earnings.

Due to the self-regulation of the difficulty, mining will always be around, and will in the long term be just barely profitable enough to have sufficient miners in place. So there's no worries about mining going away. The miners that do stay will likely barely cover power costs. We have enough mining in place now to cover bitcoin activities for the foreseeable future.
However, that's the long term. Right now there is so much overcapacity (due to overinvestment) from ASIC miners coming online that virtually all hardware sold from September on will have negative ROI over its lifetime, which is why buying coins makes more sense. If you spend 3K or 100K, at current mining equipment prices you'll have less money to show than what you paid. This will eventually correct, with mining equipment prices coming down and (possibly) mining capacity dropping offline at some point in the future due to it being unprofitable.
Mining actually is losing value due to the oversupply -- hence crazy difficulty increases. Buying bitcoin helps with price discovery and helps establish a price floor, and each dollar of bitcoin purchased provably contributes more value to bitcoin than the incremental mining capacity the same money would buy -- so the pendulum has swung pretty solidly into the "buy" camp.
