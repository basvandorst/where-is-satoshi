Don't you think this is a narrow minded analogy?
People keep going to ghash for greed reasons, also because ghash is widely advertised.
People have better chances to discover problems in free, open source software not because they are looking at code on purpose, to do security audits, for example just because they are trying to track a bug that's unrelated to security.
How do you think, what's more likely - someone to do a git bisection when the source code is available, or someone to debug machine code to find a problem?
Maybe you are trying to contest that free, open source software is more exposed to the public and more flexible when it comes to feedback and contribution?
1. I have discovered a bug in a free software program.
2. I have filled a bug report.
3. Some other user, not a commiter, claimed my bug report is invalid, because "he couldn't reproduce"
4. There were no comments from any commiters, they were probably busy with higher priority tasks
5. I was confident my bug report is legit, took a few hours and wrote a fix that was backwards compatible with the trunk, filled a pull request
6. A developer with commit access noticed that and merged it
7. The end
This is a real story. This happened to me personally. It wasn't security related, just a functional bug. It was bitcoin related software. If it would be some proprietary stuff, it would stop at 2. and I'd have no further control over it.

Here's a simple trick that'll help you to avoid situations like these in the future. Backups often are treated like "just make a full copy and get done with it". This is very simplistic. Think of it from this perspective - there's data and there's **very important data** on your devices. Very important is the data that actually hurts when you lose it, like your bitcoin wallet(s). Very important data is small amounts - the smaller, the better. So think carefully about what's really important to reduce the amount of it to minimum. Very important data requires more specific treatment and more love. That's why you get a checklist file on every device and actually write down there every file or directory that contains valuable data. And you do it as soon as the valuable data gets created on that device or gets copied there. So whenever you need to do something as extreme as a format, you first go and review your valuable data checklist, make sure you have multiple backups, make sure they are fresh and make sure you can actually restore data from those backups. Of course this is not a silver bullet but it will greatly reduce the chance of data loss.

I understand you have reasons to be upset. Yet if i would be you - I would try to negociate a deal. If your teacher is so sensitive about topic choice - ask her to provide a long list of topics she considers legit, pick one, redo the goddamn assignment, just to leave it behind and advance towards the end of the nightmare that's called school and that doesn't seem to change at all. If the deal won't work, well - other redditors gave you advices about talking involving some adults into this. Yet bear in mind you won't be fighting a narrow minded teacher, you might get to face a whole system and you might find out it's not worth it.
Yet, think of this as of a valuable life lesson. Don't let your negative attitude towards the teacher dominate your will of learning new things and educating yourself (I've been there and I know this can be a problem when things get personal between you and the teacher). And if someday you get to become someone who has influence over the education process - make it better for younger generations.

That's exactly what peasants were told when capitalists were starting to take over the middle age aristocracy.
Ok, peasants were living in deep shit often, but sometimes they would rebel and kill some aristocracy, even occasionally behead kings.
Then the peasants made the revolutions, paid for them with their own blood, but didn't profit much themselves, unlike the big money bags.
The life standards improved, sure, but mostly because of the advancement of technology and science, not because of wise management of the results of human labor. The new wealthy elite learned its lessons and tightened the grip. Have you seen many mobs rushing mansions of rich bankers and lynching them after huge financial collapses? No, because, you know "that's not lawful"!
It's the same with bitcoin. This isn't just about the "thing", it's not just about a new shiny technology that has potential. It's about the early adopters that already grew into a sect of arrogant people that treats late adopters as their slaves. You have this highly charismatic anon guy Satoshi and a bunch of early adopters who occasionally pull stunts with the market or instantly scam lots of people at once (think TradeFortress) and they are always there to cover up eachother. Of course many people want them to fail. People from the bitcoin community, not outsiders that only see the financial aspect of the bitcoin bubble.

It's not just propaganda, it's a long plan to make sure that certain countries in Europe stay above the competition and are able to dictate the rules for as long as possible.
Remember what happened after the Berlin wall collapse.
Germany reunited. Because hurr durr freedom, democracy and all those buzzwords. At the same time two other eventually strong industrial competitors for Germany from the eastern block got split. Czechoslovakia got split peacefully. Yugoslavia got split after a war.
And now the time has come for Ukraine. It is just an exchange coin. Selling a whole country to another master is very profitable for the small group of people who do it, even if it's a small country. And Ukraine isn't even small, so there are huge profits at stake. Things won't get any better for the average Joe there. But they are free to try. They blew up their chance by doing basically nothing since the collapse of Soviet Union instead of working to emerge as regional economic power like Germany, because they had everything - fertile soil, natural resources, well developed industry inherited from Soviet Union, access to sea. They lost everything and are a fucked up country now. Otherwise the OP would be there enjoying an european level life now, not on the other side of the earth, instigating to "revolution" (or maybe just begging for a bit of bitcoin using this way).

I would rather call it "concerned", but I don't mind other people using different wording.

fail number one: suggesting vmware
vmware has very strong israeli ties, you would want to avoid it completely
fail number two: suggesting backtrack linux
there's no backtrack linux anymore, the script kiddies behind that thing rebanded themselves to kali linux in a desperate attempt to walk away from a compromised brand

I think I just found one of them. Those who bite off more than then can swallow - usually choke on it.

being a beast isn't that bad, you can't have bitcoin but you get to be able to lick your own balls
it's a fair trade i'd say

WU gives cash
you will have to provide your ID in addition to the secret transfer code, so it's not anonymous
some countries, especially poor and corrupted ones that rely heavily on money transactions from citizens working outside - monitor people using money transfers: banks are sharing transfer data with police - so if you drive a car and get stopped by a traffic cop - it may be because he knows you've received money a few days ago and wants a bribe
it's also common for these countries to have gangs that camp WU offices for robbing the people who just got cash. go for the money with someone, single persons are targetted more often - because no witnesses

I heard that glue is toxic. Never bothered to research if this is a conspiracy or not, not using mail for ages.


Perhaps you can make some noise about trust pages not being accessible for guests. And about bitcointalk not being tor friendly, which sucks.
