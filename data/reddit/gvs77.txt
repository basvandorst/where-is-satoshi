Secondly, centralization is one of the problems with the lightening network.

Presidents/governments always ruin countries, it's part of the job description I guess.  Which is part of the reason Bitcoin has to go, it's sound money.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:12:41
As I pointed out, I don't agree that it requires a single point of control. But if you accept your definition, fiat money and even government is also decentralized.
Your definition makes it a fixed, binary concept, which I don't  think it is.  There are degrees of centralization. Where lightening is about as centralized as banking is, while Bitcoin is very much decentralized.

@_date: 2018-01-20 10:07:13
The LN was not the intention when Bitcoin started and is in fact a separate protocol.  I get that you need an option for &lt; 5s transactions to use it at POS terminals, but sending 500 € with an 11 € fee is problematic. I do not want that off chain.  
I believe the LN will lead to cd realization as well as control by the banking industry.

First part is true if Bitcoin is digital gold and not a currency.  But that is not the case.
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:39:57
They are not currency, they are a token representing a currency.  Much like a food stamp or coupon isn't food, but it can be exchanged for it.
None of this applies to modularity either.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:54:55
That is not what modularity means.   Having two protocols to handle the same action because the first one is too slow is a workaround, and an ugly one at that.  Better to fix and only have one protocol to do one thing.  modularity applies to it not doing many things.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:32:54
Nice anecdotal statement.  11$ is a lot depending on the value of the transaction and still rules out Bitcoin as a currency instead of an investment.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:09:11
Yes it is. Centralization does not require 1 central point or the legacy financial system would be considered decentralized as would the power grid.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:39:50
I've been into computers for 27 years, been a professional system engineer for almost 20 and I disagree.

No, not BCH. DASH.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:45:41

@_date: 2018-01-02 16:05:09
We are debating semantics now, which is pointless and no longer serves the discussion on Bitcoin.
The point is that I don't accept the modularity of LN and given who funded it, it will lead to centralized hubs under control of big financial players.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:13:18
it is not a scaling solution but a separate protocol. If this is the only way to scale the blockchain, than that concept is flawed.  off course we know it isn't as Dash and Bitcoin Cash manage to scale on-chain.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:28:53
I'm quite suspicious of the recent exponential price increase, wondering if they just might be doing that.  But you are right, they have the means and the best motive.

You state that government bombs and drones in the middle east on behalf of oil companies, yet you argue to provide the servants of big oil with more funding to wage war.  Strange
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:15:25
BCH has the malleability fix, just not segwit.  And the argument about not being able to run full nodes at increased future blocksizes assumes technology won't evolve, which is does.  The 1MB limit has been in effect since times where hard drives where much smaller and more expensive.
But the main point stays that if block chains can't scale, the technology is faulty to begin with.
The LN is a danger very similar to centralization.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:00:26
From Belgium here.  Besides a 21% sales tax, fuel consists of 70% taxes (as does electricity). Both would be a fraction of the cost without government.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:04:36
I did not say that. I merely pointed out that if the government is a proxy for big oil, increasing government funding does not hurt it's masters.
I agree that government is controlled by big business, mainly oil and banking. Politicians are nothing but sock puppets doing another's bidding.

You would hear that less often of commies, their Stockholm syndrome means the at incapable of thinking of government as bad.
But on the topic, not knowing who created Bitcoin and the government pushing for electronic money makes it a possibility. Though I remain inclined to think it was genuinely a decentralised solution to money.  I believe government and banking have infiltrated Bitcoin and Axa's stake in block stream is very concerning.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:24:31
That part is true, but there are still things they can do, one is to drive up the price and then crash it to put the public off.  They've been advertising that it's a bubble so loudly, I think they will cause the bubble in 2018, 2019 by the latest.  The reason for this specific timeframe is that it needs to be gone to suit their other ongoing plans like abolishing cash and the plan to remove the deposit guarantees.  All these things have to be sorted out before they can launch the next financial crisis
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:10:33
Ln is another protocol on top of Bitcoin/Blockchain. It does not solve scalability of block chain technology, it simply bypasses it.  If the blockchain can't scale up, the technology failed but Dash seems convinced they can scale up to the level that matches the amount off conventional financial transactions on-chain.  I sincerely hope it can be done.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:47:25
Exactly.  And they only need to buy a few more years to engineer the next big crash, which will be the biggest transfer of wealth in history.
Gold and silver are much smaller threats because they usually just confiscate that.

You haven't followed the recent news?  From an ECB talking head saying Bitcoin will cause bankruns, to legislation to ban and restrict it.  New legislation in the US will make it a crime to conceal that you own cryptos.  The global monetary system and their government minions have commited such crimes as the overthrow of Gaddafi in Libya (to stop his gold Dinar).  These aren't nice people and their crimes, though legal, or quite open.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:56:08
First off, you are approaching a moral issue through practicality.  Salvery was very practical but morally wrong as is taxation.
A lot of the infrastructure in the US was built in times when there was no income tax through indirect taxes of 2-3%, so that argument is flawed.
And people want roads, you could get them build by crowdfunding for example. You would not fund fireign invasions, bank bailouts or exuberant salaries of politicians that way.
I morally check every system against the non-agression principle and taxation clearly excludes that.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:57:19
So, what is theft and extortion and how does taxation differ from it.
Also, please tell me how a group of people can delegate a moral right that none of them individually possess.
If I want any of these services, I'm willing to pay for them myself, but only those I want to have.  I will never voluntarily pay for wars.
And just a note, I'm not an American.

@_date: 2017-12-12 15:09:11
I strongly disagree, I know in advance that they will not get much money, so I opt for another method.  I'm a big fan of Bitcoin and I hope to one day pay in restaurants etc with it, and both slowness and fees hold that back.
And LN is not a scaling solution, it's building a separate protocol on top of the blockchain, so conceding that blockchain tech doesn't scale and is not ready for mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:15:13
Your position seems so much more rational now you moved up to kindergarten level arguing.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:58:39
Practicality does not overrule morality. Slavery was not impractical, it was immoral.
Secondly, countries do not streamline anything, they seem to be the least efficient in nearly anything, but I'll get back to that below. So about infer connecting roads, if different countries succeed in connecting roads (as you see all over Europe), private entities could come to similar agreements and have more incentive to do it efficiently.  But even if it was less efficient, the lack of violent coercion makes it the only moral option.
You mentioned government efficiency, so let's look at education and I will use Belgian statistics here as I'm familiar with those.  Public schools spend about 18k € per high school student per year, this puts 20 to 30 kids per teacher and they have access to 1 computer per 4 students. Private schools cost about 12k per year and put 5-10 students per teacher with a computer for each student.  How efficient is that?
And lastly, you cannot deny that governments wage wars (certainly not if you are from the US or any country in the Northern Atlantic Terror Organization - NATO), hence they are immoral even if everything else they did was good.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:12:05
If your system requires the use of violence, then your system is immoral, no matter how nice you dress it up.

@_date: 2017-12-31 17:02:21

Not saying blocksize is the only part to scaling, or even that it is the key to it.  But for the blockchain to work as a currency, it needs to scale to that point.  Building another protocol to handle your scaling is admitting the core protocol is flawed as a currency.
Dash seems to think they can scale to 50k/tx on chain and blocksize is part of that plan.

@_date: 2017-03-21 14:58:51
I disagree. Competing altcoins will always be a (good) thing. But there is a genuine problem with high transaction fees and slow confirmations (slowest for me meant days).
The EFT thing was not about BTC itself, just if it would be endorsed, and the outcome was highly predictable.
Here we have two competing solutions for a real issue with BTC itself and the result, a fork, will have implication on BTC's working itself (loss of nodes at the very least).

Off course, that may help avoid a tax audit, but in the event of an audit, the bitcoin don't help, they will simply tally the small amounts.  
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:26:43
I haven't seen one yet that accepts that (Belgium), online retailers that accept bitcoin require a copy of your ID card to do so, so do the 3 ATM's in BE.
@_date: 2016-06-23 11:06:15
The problem I see with Bitcoin is that converting to it from money and back leaves a big trail.  I can only buy bitcoin with my bank account, so only with money that is already in the system, hence I cannot avoid taxes with it.
But even if I have 1 million in untaxed bitcoin, I can't spend it anonymously, so stuck there again.
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:10:10
so, the transfer from your card is logged and visible for one, but depositing it back into a bank account will also be logged and tracked.  In BE you'll have to pay taxes on the extra value generated and if your profit exceeds 10K euro, they will block the account under monye laundring laws and investigate the source (can take several months)
@_date: 2016-06-25 07:12:04
Belgian/EU law is much more strict. Bitcoin ATM's all require government ID, so even a 1 € transaction is logged.  
  
The merchants only accept bitcoin on transactions where they do have your personal details on file and the government has insight into this list.
So, the only way to do something anonymous with Bitcoin is on the black market.
@_date: 2016-06-25 10:41:21

They would still fail.  They attack Bitcoin more subtle because it would become popular with the general public once they realise the scam.   That is why banning cash is also a slow process. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:39:11
Every single fiat currency before has gone to 0. There were thousands of them.  It's a Ponzi scheme run by central banks and governments.  Whatever they do,  they'll never do something that jeopardizes that.  It's their only reason for existing.

Can't talk about the US, but AFAIK here in Belgium, they're taxed similarly (and heavily).
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:38:45
I'm not religious on Bitcoin, it has it's economic value of being the first and most widely accepted Crypto currency while it lacks in some technical aspects like real anonymity which Dash has as an option. 
But regardless of the value you attach to it, Bitcoin cash is closer to the protocol we had 6 months ago and core deviates further from that. Again without assigning value to either, why is that incorrect? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:42:42
I followed the whole debate for a long time before I formed my own opinion. Basically, the BCH people feel that Bitcoin was meant to scale by increasing the block size and they take issue with that solution being replaced with segwit and layer 2 scaling. The latter because they don't view that as a scaling solution. 
After being neutral on it until I understood the issue enough, I agree with them. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:09:16
Instasend is a separate mechanism, normal Dash transactions don't use it and will have to scale as Bitcoin cash does, by increasing block size.

The split BCH is exactly that BTC devs are focussing on off-chain for scaling while BCH is supposed to deliver scaling on-chain. That's a very big difference in vision. 
While I still use BTC because of it's current economic status and wider use, I believe off-chain scaling to be a bad idea. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:38:54

Solving scaling by moving transactions off-chain is not a scaling solution, it's not even true to block chain any more. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:05:39
Bitcoin did change the system but the scaling issue, which hasn't been solved, hold it back. 
A bank transfer takes about two days, I've had expensive transactions with Bitcoin take longer and it's not improving. This is not about buying coffee any more, this is a problem for larger purchases too. 
I highly doubt people would eve be looking at Bitcoin cash if these problems had been fixed.. I'm personally more inclined to move to Dash. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:40:36
I also accept BTC from customers but the problem for me is that even though I prefer Bitcoin, I have to convert to fiat for about 99% of my purchases. How do you solve that? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:08:28
I get all that but don't see any value in it but it has downsides. Dash offers &lt;4s instant transactions without a secondary network.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:05:11
You read a piece of FUD on Bitcoin. How much electricity does the global banking system use? How much energy does tax collection use? Yet they don't seem to mention them.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:37:42
That is not the case, Dash has insta send as a feature, not because of low network load
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:27:03
There are several reasons for that. 
First being that it is not a scaling solution as you reduce the protocol to a settlement layer. Second, layers on top of the chain don't provide the same security as the blockchain itself. And lastly, it isn't needed. Both BCH and Dash are scaling successfully on chain. 
@_date: 2017-04-23 20:59:30
Change bank? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:08:00
Wasn't increasing block size the planned way to scale up by Satoshi? It's also the plan for Dash who see blocks of &gt;400mb in their future. 
If you cannot scale on chain it means that block chain technology has failed. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 21:57:15
I disagree with how to solve it (layer 2). But,  yes,  privacy is essential.
There is no legitimate need for governments to see transactions. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:19:13
If you deposit money,  you're giving out an unsecured loan to your bank. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:09:13
regulate bitcoin? How do you do that?
@_date: 2017-04-17 13:49:30
Fiat has value because governments force people to accept it.  Bitcoin has value because people believe it does. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:47:33
So people fuck eachother over unless they are in control of millions of other people,  that brings out their inner saint.... 
And fiat money is created out of nothing by entities that are outside of democratic control.  There is nothing complex about it at all. 
But if you feel that this communist principle is a good thing,  by all means invest in that.  
@_date: 2017-04-16 15:51:39
In case of fiat (made up)  money,  that means that central banks made 8% out of nothing while commercial banks made up the other 92% out of nothing,  charge you interest over lending you air. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:42:54
What you are describing is market manipulation and central planning.  
Secondly,  increasing the supply of money devaluates the currency and is identical to counterfeiting. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 13:50:13
Fiat is 100% out of thin air and not capped like bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 18:31:12
if they can't regulate, they will fight it. regulation will kill it.
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:00:23
It really isn't more complex.  Central banks are private institutions that print money out of nothing which you are legally forced to use and accept.  The complex mechanics start at other banks creating money they don't have on loans and serve mainly to hide this giant Ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:17:27
So,  keep your assets in fiat if you think that's a good idea.  I'm not stopping you.  But stop dressing up central planning as a free market because it isn't.
@_date: 2017-04-18 11:19:14
That is also one of my primary concerns about BU. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:02:13
I also forgot to mention that market interventions are part of communist style and counter to free markets. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:00:00
Another left FUD piece.
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:58:57
There have been thousands of fiat currencies before and they all went to 0. It's a ponzi scheme and it will crash this time as it did before. But the country attached to the scheme can go down with it.. Unless you believe you'll really put up 250k$ per person in a US to cover outstanding liabilities. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:02:18
Every one of those services is paid for with loans those governments can't mathematically pay back. If they default on them, their currency debases. Look at Venezuela and what the Greece crisis caused for the Euro. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:34:24
And those governments have proven to be insolvent already. So you have to be crazy to believe them. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:08:08
Oh, and that is even disregarding the danger government poses to your stored wealth, even where you did pay income tax on it. My country's government is discussing taxing stored wealth yearly. They can't do that with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-09-17 12:49:56
I'm not saying there's no value in Bitcoin.  But using the US dollar being worthless as a defense while it lost 90% of it's value since 1913 is not a good argument.  And you will be kidnapped and locked in a cage should you refuse to trade in / accept this worthless debt notes.
@_date: 2018-07-14 19:59:07
No, I want government reduced to the bare minimum and unless you do that it doesn't matter which puppet you put there.
@_date: 2018-07-14 19:41:21
It's a proven fact that the Saoudi's and my country gave Clinton money. Why isn't that a big deal? Isn't that treason then?
Why isn't the US selecting and killing leaders in the middle east a big deal? Trump does that, but the goons that came before him did it too.
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:33:11
I point out that dollars and euros aren't backed either and at least Bitcoin has a limited supply. 
In a sense, they are right, but fail to use that criterium for fiat. Want something that has backing, buy him or silver. Both are excellent at storing value but impossible to do transactions currently. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 21:18:17
I still call bullshit on the Russian story.  Funny how we ignore the saoudi's making large donations to Clinton and even my country, Belgium, deposited 600k of taxpayer money in to her account. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:54:35
How exactly will the US (or the EU for that matter) repay their debts? 
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:24:03
Actually, it doesn't.  I've tried that already and it took over an hour to withdraw money...
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:36:45
Taxes, like from everything else
@_date: 2016-10-20 09:07:06
There are so many reasons why she would oppose it:
* She works for the banks
* Her leftist dream is total insight and control in what people own and spend
* Taxation, taxation, taxation.
Bitcoin does nothing for her narrative and everything against it.
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:28:10
Yeah, like when I claimed the NSA had unofficial programs to eavesdrop, or I claimed the banks would break and steal public money. Or when I insisted the US went to war on false accusations in Iraq, Libya and now Syria.  I'm a real nutjob, there is absolutely no proof that governments are evil just because they steal over half of what you earn and kill people with parts of that.
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:43:14
In this case, there was no problem with the 7 hours, in the case of online purchases, there wouldn't be a big problem with 7 hours (though fees are annoying given that bank-card payments are free).
But it rules out BTC for paying for in person purchases like coffee or in store payments (I have not used it for that, but it would be interesting to do so)
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:29:36
I'm not sure L2 is the right approach either...
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:26:45
I did one yesterday at 160sat/B and it took 7 hours to process
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:22:54
Just to add,  the 7 hours doesn't mean BTC is broken,  a national bank transaction takes 24 to 48 hours.  But POS payments or ATM withdrawals are not feasible this way. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:17:35
My last transaction took 7 hours…  If you want to use BTC for purchases,  you need to be sure it verifies quickly,  not that it could if you are lucky. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:34:41
Put a live feed to them from your bed and bathroom!  Nothing to hide
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:25:33
I personally don't buy anything illegal, but people can do that for all I care in cases like weed.
That doesn't mean the government has any business in what I do. 
But as shown recently in both Cyprus and India, governments confiscating assets is a real risk.  Secondly, governments are considering taxing assets, which is why they want to know everything you have.
@_date: 2017-05-04 10:57:32
I know this is a joke, but it does have truth in it.  We offset bitcoin and precious metals against the dollar (or euro) as if those are static.  They aren't.
To get a base layer, we could look at common goods, how much bread could I buy with a dollar/euro/btc at some point in time.  But right now, drops in value for fiat currency will look likes peaks in sound money.
@_date: 2016-05-29 08:57:45
I didn't know you could do that ��
@_date: 2017-07-10 08:46:37
In the real world,  it is currency.  It fits all properties of currency. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:00:28
How is this new? 
@_date: 2017-07-10 08:45:51
They confuse money and currency, money stores value over great periods of time.  
Gold and silver are money,  bitcoin and dollars/euros are currency.  
Dollars over a 100 year period where highly volatile and have a linear downward trend that already lost 90+% of it's original value. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:12:48
In this debate, there are two sides with reasonable sounding arguments with competing solutions.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:12:08
Oh,  and this talked about the risks of segwit:  
@_date: 2017-07-10 10:49:10
Only 3% of Fiat is in the form of coins and paper,  the rest is digital only.  So the power going out affects that too. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:20:05
I agree with you in part.  It has become useless as a currency to buy coffee with because of the delays and fees.  But if I get money from an ATM, I pay 0.70 euro in fees every time (also regardless of value).  
Sending oversees transactions is prohibitively expensive and takes over a week, national transactions between 2 banks take 1-2 days and don't pass on weekends or holidays...  BTC has it's drawbacks, but still not bad.
@_date: 2017-07-07 21:59:50
The IRS is a criminal organzation 
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:25:44
Note that the fee is not proportionate to transaction value but to size.   A transaction of 10000eur with the same inputs would cost the same as the effort is equal. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:05:26
Very curious about the outcome.  Had similar issues with them but always got them solved. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:21:29
It is..  To them
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:36:38
I disagree with having unlimited blocksizes, that will quickly make it too expensive to run a full node.
But there has been criticism on segwit and double spending that I cannot tell if it is true or not.
I'm also not a big fan of layer 2 as a solution.
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:11:15
I will have to clarify that, I think a transaction time of a few minutes is fine for layer 1 and that should cover a lot of usecases.  If I buy a car in bitcoin, I can wait 5-10 minutes for it to confirm, but not 12 hours.
Layer 2 could be useful for instant and/or small payments, but it should not be the solution to scaling normal transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:34:03
Governments aren't your friend and criminals lumps people who evade taxes,  people who buy marijuana or similar in one block with terrorists.  The first two are afraid of governments,   the latter mostly depend on them. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:10:55
Which you should be using anyway... Never trust an online wallet
@_date: 2017-07-07 09:32:18


Shapeshift is limited in how much you send through (0.9 BTC), don't know if you can do subsequent conversions
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:20:53
When you don't understand the deep technical working of the blockchain, they both make good arguments.  The problem is knowing which arguments are true and which aren't.
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:23:10
That is true, but still, both the high fee for low value transactions and the slow confirmation times make it unusable for buying coffee, in store purchases etc.
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:44:57
No you couldn't off course, they'd never allow that.  But limits have now been reduced for anonymous cards to a fraction of what they were before.  This will probably affect BTC ATM's also BTW
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:49:53
No, it doesn't apply to verified cards BUT.
This means EU governments track those cards and will pursue taxes on profits from bitcoin value increases.  In my country, that'll be 30%
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:19:47
I'd like to pay for most things I already buy with bitcoin. Including food. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:40:35
Those are partly mixed, but my comment applies to them even more so.  The ECB and Federal Reserve set up a pyramid scheme and print money out of thin air with the goal of obtaining the real assets people have.  Bitcoin is their enemy since it allows people to keep wealth outside of the pyramid scheme
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:47:56
I checked on this also, got a mail from Wirex, this will go into effect this month and affects all credit cards used in Europe... So, very bad news.
@_date: 2017-06-17 08:05:55
That is exactly what the are doing.  Governments are owned by banks, they just have to do their bidding in a way that the population doesn't hang them. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:34:45
Yes, that helps a lot.
Given someone that doesn't know the people involved nor the entire technology of segwit and blockchains, it is hard to judge who is full of shit :-)
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:33:41
The could,  but that ban would be hard to enforce,  meanwhile, the days of the traditional banks are running out.  Their collapse is inevitable. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:00:45
Number one does not exist if you ask me.  You might make it less obvious who owns the card, you won't be anonymous.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:44:35
Banks and their government minions are afraid of crypto because it'll be the only way out when they ban cash and set up the next crash. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 09:34:31
That would be gold. It has always been currency.  Bitcoin is the world's first digital universal currency though.  I like both, but they aren't the same
