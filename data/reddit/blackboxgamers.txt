I actually had no idea I could do that. Thank!

I mean, even paid services sell off your data. This perceived notion that free services are the only ones doing it is laughable.

Good thing that the government cannot possibly track whose wallet is whose and that there are ways to buy and sell crypto anonymously. (Not only that, you can mine crypto and the government won't know"

I forgot, accounts are tied to your Social Security Number and you can only have one account.

The one idiot who dropped out of High school, waged a bet with his parents that he could be a millionaire with Bitcoin without going back or getting his GED. 
Yeah, pretty retarded if you ask me to not get a higher education and wage a risky bet... 
He's a millionaire, but also a dumbass. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:47:29
Yeah, it doesn't look like my transaction went to the network, even though the funds look like they have been removed from my PC wallet.
I'm going to try reinstalling Exodus to see what gives. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:57:46
UPDATE: Yeah, reinstalling removed the transactions that didn't go through. 
I'll check out a different wallet, Thank you! :)

Rule one: Never buy a wallet on Ebay (used or otherwise) I'd buy straight from the manufacturer.
I can't say if its fake or not, but I wouldn't trust it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:39:04




Go look at the AMA he did. 


If you don't have the patience to finish High school, good luck in life. 


He also likes to flaunt it, so he may be a M before crypto, but he's also a douche, and again, anyone could be a self-made M by investing or paying for investors that will help you.
Besides, you're implying that RV was poor, which is not true. Born and raised in Silicon Valley his parents were very rich. 
But you can shill for your god, but your god also pled guilty to selling explosives on eBay, so.

He also set fire to a Nazi flag, but seemingly nobody wants to mention that when they throw the words "Nazi Scum" around, right ?

People are literally treating btc like a currency, they are buying things with it. Is that not what a currency is?

You've listed HOW it could be used, but still not a single case OF it being used, meanwhile your same source mentions the case my source talks about.
Also this is from your source:


So, I think we've got our answer. Gag orders are NOT TO SILENCE THE MEDIA.
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:01:16
Sorry, you're wrong here.


Speaking of which, gag orders are normally issued so Defendants and prosecutors don't talk about the case outside court, like in the "affluenza" case 
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:47:13
Good question, why do idiots continue to follow failed socialist ideals.
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:55:36
Uk threw him in prison because he was reporting on some court case that was going on. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:36:53
I'm sorry, I can't hear you over FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, although the UK doesn't have shit to protect their citizens. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:08:30
Ah, someone who follows blindly. The government likes people like you. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:56:45
Nope. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:53:30
Hey look, it's the same stupid shit that republicans use. "Don't like the way things are, move to somalia!" Looks like the same stupid mindset lives everywhere. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 05:51:57
I see Jim Carry... 
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:51:01
You can't bring up someones history while you're using a crypto only alt. Bruh, fuck off lmao. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:40:44
Exactly, that's why decentralized payments like Btc is important. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:21:43
People shouldn't listen to bankers, of course they would say its a fraud.. It goes against them. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:46:25
The US has jailed reporters outside of an ongoing case? Oh please, working in the field, I'd love to see who was jailed.
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:42:44
2005 - 18 years ago
2011 - 7 years ago
2012 - 6 years ago
2013 - 5 years ago
And only one of those crimes is "bad" (the one 18 years ago) 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:57:25
uh.... This is free... 
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:39:52
Wait until it gets more adoption, I don't see how that is so hard to understand from you doubters. 
Man, This sub has been infested with Shill doubters. Mods should ban them away. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:27:08
Bought in during the dip / Equifax bullshit. Glad I did. 
Honestly, I first heard about bitcoin back in 2013 (Senior year) and I should have bought in then... I really kick myself about that.

Its funny how people's go to is to believe big banks... 
Now, what scandal will hit Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan / Chase next week?
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:53:33
It was $30 - $40 when I heard about it.
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:24:42
Jamie, pull that shit up! 
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:08:42
So, how would one go about getting my btc, ltc, and eth to a software wallet? 
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:13:05
Thanks man, I'll look more into it today. :) 
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:14:53
Let them hodl on the Tether, it will crash like BitConnect and every holder will lose. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:16:19
At that point, you should be asking what the hell is wrong with my government, not what the hell is wrong with Bitcoin.
