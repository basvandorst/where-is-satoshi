cryptocurrencies will accentuate inequalities in wealth distribution because they are harder to regulate. you can't nationalize a massive corporation's private keys, and the pareto principle exists for a reason.

i'm saying that your initial comparison of bitcoin to roulette fails to actually differentiate them

he doesn't own that ten bucks, he owns part of a bitcoin.

can you conceive of a rational future where bitcoin is worthless?  yes, because the implementation isn't substantially different from dozens of worthless shitcoins that are out there and because existing infrastructure does not imply permanence.  how many people worked in stables in 1870?  how many people work in gas stations today?
if the market can crash faster than you can get your money out (and yes, it can), there is a nonzero chance that you lose everything.

if you put ten bucks on roulette you get the chance to win money once the wheel stops spinning, which is an asset.  you could transfer this asset by selling it to someone else at any time.  the asset's value is obviously zero if the wheel stops and you don't win but you still own that asset forever insofar as ownership is meaningful for assets of definite zero value.  
i could just as easily try to sell a crashed cryptocurrency that i hoarded as i could try to sell my chance to win yesterday's game of roulette.  in the buyer's estimation, $10 worth of bitcoin is worth exactly as much as $10 worth of chance to win roulette *at time of purchase.*  the only difference in that value's progression is that a game of roulette has a very clearly defined end-state while bitcoin doesn't.

but in both cases there's a nonzero chance that you lose all the money you've bet, which is the point at which you were initially attempting to draw a contrast

imagine a game of roulette where the wheel will stop spinning either when you ask it to stop or at a random point between now and eternity, whichever comes first

dollar cost averaging is about softening the psychological impact of seeing a dip and thereby convincing you to invest more than you otherwise would have.  in a bull market you end up making more because you put more in, not because dollar cost averaging is a mathematically sound strategy.  it's the investing equivalent of the debt-snowball method.
