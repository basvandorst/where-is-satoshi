I asked this because I thought that the value of Bitcoin is increasing over the years. So $10 worth of BTC right now would worth more after 5-10 years.

Sorry but maybe I don't understand how Bitcoin works. I'm new on BTC so can you please explain me this:
If the mining difficulty increases, as the technology advances, doesn't the value of Bitcoin also increases ?

I got it thank you, that's a nice explanation!

I'm talking about long term obviously. Of course you can't predict for next year, but what about 5 to 10 years?
Doesn't the mining difficulty increases, as the technology advances?

Instead of answering this simple question you keep posting comments about how idiot I am. How big of a piece of shit do you have to be to do something like that?
Do you even know what basic human decency means?

Sorry, I'm a BTC noob.

Oh I understand. So how and why does the Bitcoin value increases? I thought it was because as it gets easier to mine bitcoins with a certain amount of power, the BTC value rate is changing.

That wasn't my question in the first place. Did you even read what question I quoted?
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:27:09
AFAIK BTC value is increasing over the years. So isn't this common sense?

Sorry I haven't catch up.

Can someone explain me what is this UASF proposal on Coinbase? Should I be worried about my BTC?
