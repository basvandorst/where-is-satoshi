Thanks for the explanations. I'll have to read into more of this. It's actually an interesting subject. I just thought in theory the "Nothing at Stake" attack was basically the PoS version of the 51% attack for PoW, since both are done requiring a specific amount of something.
The only arguments I had seen prior to this was Jeff Garzik saying "All you need to do is math to prove it doesn't work", which isn't at all accurate or actually saying any reasoning behind it.
Could you redirect me to any documents you know of on this?
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:23:16
Not completely accurate. ALL virtual currencies are.
I lost about 2mil wow gold to a hacker. at $1/1000. Hm. That's a $2000 loss I can throw out. After all, it does say ALL virtual currencies.
I don't think they really thought all of this through.

Good thing I'm planning on opening up a vanilla server! BTC and LTC Donations already planned.
Also, after working at Feenix, it's not worth donating to honestly :/

In that theory, I can throw everything alt coin related onto a wallet i don't have private keys of (Any exchange or wallet service basically), and it no longer belongs to me.
Works for me.

I work for BTC, wife works for Fiat(Euro).
I buy movies/games/music/electronics via BTC.
We figured out we can order delivery from restaurants via  which accepts bitcoin as a payment method for them.
Sadly, sites like Gyft don't do much for us in Europe, though I've found a few places to grab things. For Rent/bills, we use fiat (Coinbase now works in Slovakia too, so I have a US account and she has an SK account).
If I could get something like Shift here in Slovakia, I would. Until then, we stockpile most of my btc and use my wives fiat. She's a firm believer in BTC as well, and has been trying to use it as much as she can as well.

There's companies making tens of millions by selling WoW Gold and other game currencies. In fact there's multiple companies. In game currencies are probably still a larger market than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-04 05:43:55
Ah okay cool. I may have to sign up with them then. My local credit union is awesome and I actually know a few employees there use bitcoins (In fact, one wears two little badges, one for Bitcoin, one for Dogecoin), so I'm sure it's relatively safe, but alternatives are always nice.

Murder is killing with intent. What you're talking about is manslaughter. Two entirely different things, though they end at the same place, one can be for many reasons. One is planned, one is not.

Didn't The IAFCU drop bitcoin accounts a few months back? I was looking at going with them but that's all I could find, so I wasn't sure if it's trustable or not.

Don't worry. You mentioned something that isn't Bitcoin, and even though it does something better than Bitcoin, it's still bad because it's not Bitcoin.
I really hate this subreddit sometimes.

It's not even built off the Bitcoin source. It has it's own source built off the idea and technology Bitcoin uses. How is it another scamclonecoin that is being pumped?
Do your research before looking like an idiot, seriously.

No reason for bitcoin to hold a special place?
Bitcoin to money is the equiv to dotcom for web, google for searching, etc. It's new, it's useful, it's what causes a step to the next generation. Now we see more altcoins being used. Look at LTC and DOGE. There are Hundreds of millions of fiat currencies in alt coins now. If you don't think Bitcoin deserves to be special for creating that, then nothing is special period.

I do not a single dollar, euro, or Bitcoin invested in NXT, you uneducated fuck. I just enjoy advances in technology. I'm not a simple minded child like you. Bitcoin is lacking in functionality against all these shitcoins. The reason it's at the top still is it was the first adopted and is the most stable. That doesn't automatically make it the best.

My question is, why isn't proof-of-stake viable? Because people like Jeff Garzik, who refuses to even test or mess with the concept, says it's not, and the only proof he represents is his own word saying it isn't secure, meanwhile 10 years from now Bitcoin itself may not be secure?
Mining or Staking, both would need to be updated throughout time. This is already understood. The arguments towards this that I've seen are just from someones ego.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:02:09
I think It'd be more fun to use their own rule against them then to just try and get out of it.
@_date: 2014-11-15 12:21:05
I read a bit on the Nothing at Stake attack. It's essentially forking is it not, which NXT has decentralized auto checkpointing to prevent any forks from a certain length from being accepted. On top of this, it still requires a large portion (30 - 40%) to be able to attack a coin. What's the difference between this and a mining pool with a large sum of the power being hacked and used for another purpose? I mean in theory, both can cause the same damage. Look at Vericoin. An exchange was hacked that held 30% of the coins total amount and it was abused. If a pool or two for mining were hacked, in theory it'd be the same thing.
Really, it's an equivalent to a 51% attack. It's possible, but not feasible, and yes, it would be extremely costly to do.
As for "No hash function has ever been broken in a way which would compromise the security of mining.": A 51% attack hasn't been done, but it's possible. Bash had an exploit for 25 years before it was noticed (Shellshock), and then heavily abused. You act like PoW is absolute.
Now, I still may be wrong, if so, please correct me on what you can. I consider this a chance to learn

You could instead do what I'm doing.
I'm filing my 2BTC earning for the past year.
I'm filing my 13LTC earning for the past year.
I'm also filing losses from video games. They're still virtual currencies, and follow under the laws. I've lost about $2500 due to hackers via my game currencies. I'll just throw that in there too.

Really, still following me around like a useless asshat? You must get bored of following specific people around and harassing them at all times. What's even funnier is that I posted that over a month ago, and you're replying to it.

Fuck Coinbase because you've got a key logger or similar allowing someone into your stuff.

So interest is deeply unjust? If guy 1 holds his money instead of blowing it as soon as he gets it, but guy 2 blows it all, there should be no benefit to it? I mean, currently the interest system with fiat works on banks loaning out your money. PoS would be like "Hold your money and make more money, without anyone else touching it". It's like a lot of places have "veteran rewards" depending on how long you've been with a place. It's similar in aspects.

I just sold my first BTC. I got in it back in 2010 but didn't think it'd go anywhere. Somewhere, there is a unused wallet now with 17BTC, and it will never be seen again :(

American here living with my Slovak wife in Bratislava. We actually found a site ( that accepts bitcoin payments for multiple restaurants in the area. We use it for delivery when we had a long day and don't feel like going out. I'll have to head to that Subway now. Haven't been to once since I moved here.

That's exactly it. This is giving them the ability to do so. Government is putting their hands where they don't belong. This is giving the IRS way too much controlling power, not that they didn't have it before. If you fail to see that, I'm sorry.

You've never been on Craigslist or Ebay have you? People think a car 10 years old has only depreciated by about 5%. People think they can build a computer for $2000 and sell it 2 years later for $1800. Trust me, People aren't very bright when it comes to the value of something.

USD is a currency released by the Government.
Bitcoins are bits of data. Just like video game currencies. Just like the Facebook points you can buy. etc. Why can't all of that be taxed?

Altavista still paved the way. Many of us still remember it. Just like Facebook completely destroyed Myspace. Myspace over took Xanga. Doesn't mean we all forgot about what brought it forward. In that theory, nothing is special. Everything gets replaced sooner or later, that's human nature.
