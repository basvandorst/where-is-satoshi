I think the gold is value because the gobal society think so. More value is the water but you pay it cheap, unless in my country. Gold is value because its the best stuff to reflect the value of the other stuff. Cryptocurrencies is going to be better than gold, we just need improve it the approche about energy, fees and distribution
