"please save us from Roger, government" -r/bitcoin

I was told the other one was the conspiracy theory subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:49:32
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:09:34
It's open source. You don't have to trust him. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:10:23
Isn't that a fairly common view amongst libertarians? Or is r/bitcoin no longer filled with libertarians?
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:13:32
I don't understand pushing this, without advocating the same for Bitcoin gold as well?
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:29:00
Did ya hold?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:05:33
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:10:53
Is any hard fork an altcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-14 04:47:03
Where do you spend your gold? That has been increasing in value over the years. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:47:39
What's the definition then?
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:37:24
It is the equivalent from a functional standpoint to a blocksize increase, but it is not a blocksize increase. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:54:04
If you are that sure. Sell and buy back tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 01:06:42
Would you support a hard fork blocksize increase + segwit?
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:46:08
Sorry I came off that way, but I am in support of segwit and lightning networks but also a blocksize increase and don't think we should be afraid of hardforks. Not sure what camp that buts me in. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:52:15
Bitcoin has been hard forked before. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 01:38:41
If I'm remember it was initially a decrease in blocksize.  I think if you proposed a 4mb hardfork with segwit you would see increased support. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:24:01
I'm not on either side but I think the people on r/bitcoin underestimate the amount of people in favor of a hard fork block size increase. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:53:19
Exactly. You could have sold and bought the dip
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:34:14
Why doesn't core make a proposal for a block size increase hardfork in addition to segwit and the increase that is included in that? Seems like that would have pretty much universal support. Or at least more support than what core or BU alone is proposing. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:56:13
The market will definitely react negatively to the ETF being denied. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:15:53
Exactly you should have sold earlier and bought back. Already dropped 200+
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:36:29
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:53:45
Guess I don't get this metaphor. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:29:59
OK so a person would have to do research before posting about someone on their own habits regarding what information they would allowed to be out there. I would think a pretty good criteria would be if a single google search gives you the persons name it is fine to use. Anyone who wanted it could easily get it. And I believe the top result for "theymos real name" gives you the answer. Or if you are against that criteria I would say don't use real names at all which you have obviously broke already. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 13:19:33
That's hilarious
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:24:31
Maybe machines are better with money than humans. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:36:20
Excuse my ignorance but doesn't this post dox Ver. I'm confused on the rules?
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:29:48
Howd you come up with this theory. I think you are giving to much credit to the us gov to pull off something like that. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:21:49
I'll give a more certain answer if we are playing that game. Between 0-100,000. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 01:38:15
He probably has OCD or something
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:16:32
So it isn't a dox? What is the criteria for when you can and can't link an account to a persons real name?
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:30:08
What do you mean? They are publishing their changes which users are free to use. That is the development process. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:21:26
How so?
@_date: 2017-01-19 02:11:09
My argument is why aren't you banned for the same reason. At who's discretion are we using to determine if it is doxing. Because obviously there are cases when using real names isn't doxing in your words. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:50:03
The current btc chain is a hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:24:33
Theres not too much difference when we are talking about the possible total market cap bitcoin could have.  
@_date: 2017-01-28 15:44:10
He is saying he's not dumb. Just trolling. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:46:13
Bread wallet and paper wallets
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:08:38
Easiest probably. Best probably not. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:33:30
No how is it centrally controlled?
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:23:03
Yeah if you are unsure than that is horrible advice. How about you buy 1/4 of what you want this week. 1/4 next and next and next week. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:55:59
100% is impossible. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 06:11:58
Gold had value before electricity was discovered.
@_date: 2017-01-28 15:47:35
You got shut down quick man. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:20:09
Exactly. Just depends on how many new investors come. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:48:10
Why'd you sell half?
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:20:15
Sometimes short term solutions are fine until a long term solution can come into existence. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:31:52
You could have at least got a vanity address. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 06:30:29
You lost/forgot your private keys
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:32:03
Just with any asset right?
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:09:48
The thing is If bitcoin has a $1 transaction fee people will move to a currency with a fee 1/20th of that. If bitcoin wants to survive it has to do something
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:50:20
I can make a fork of bitcoin tomorrow and call it bitcoin v2. Its doesn't change the supply of btc. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:49:12
@_date: 2016-12-15 20:02:40
I don't think he was charged for dealing drugs. Just creating an open ecommerce site
@_date: 2016-12-31 12:30:13
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:15:16
It is front end audited Javascript code. If you disconnect from the Internet and use the Web page. There is little to no risk. Probably about the same as a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 07:19:49
... nothing.
@_date: 2016-12-15 22:15:26
Gotcha well I guess if he was selling drugs or whatever you can argue that he should be in jail for that. Life in jail for selling drugs. That's hard to argue. Even jail time at all is hard to argue for a non violent crime. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 20:05:23
Let's throw everyone in jail. Then no innocent people can be killed!!!
@_date: 2016-12-05 13:11:27
There is no reason a company can't make a visa like system of money transfer on top of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 21:17:46
Lol. Shoots fired at luke-jr
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:43:42
@_date: 2016-12-15 21:15:32
I'm sure drugs have been sold on Craigslist. Why isn't the creator in jail?
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:27:36
That's what people said 6 months ago at 2000. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:26:58
Keep holding. You'll be fine. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 14:14:56
Almost half way there!
@_date: 2017-04-05 01:41:59
"Lukejr 23:34" nicely done
@_date: 2017-04-01 14:26:16
He probably didn't read it. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:03:01
And regret it in the future when it goes up higher than the previous ATH
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:47:44
Is store of value considered a use. Then pretty much everyone. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:10:33
Nobody should be in btc for short term gains
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:24:37
You don't think artificially low interest rates which the FED was able to impose using a fiat currency had anything to do with it?
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:05:08
Unlimited block size is not the same as a 8mb limit. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:16:12
I wouldn't call it a trick. Just another view point. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:37:18
No way. I'm going to create a bot to constantly search google for bitcoin to increase the price. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:11:28
I disagree, it promotes a more responsible economy. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:19:43
I think society functioned for many thousand years without government. I think you mean modern society. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:40:08
What investment isn't a gamble? Even holding in USD is quite the gamble and a horrible investment.

If you believe in bitcoin then hodl. If not then take your money else where.

If that is the downside to free market capitalism I will take it any day. People will learn and catch on. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:56:14
How is changing the POW algorithm not a change to the so called "rules" of bitcoin?

Bitcoin isn't considered a currency according to the IRS

All new assets are volatile as they are spread out from few to the masses. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 08:00:34
They would have to prove you had it. Not the other way around. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:33:32

@_date: 2017-09-01 22:06:28
Get out!
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:43:55
He would also be smart enough to use an alias in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:25:18
That would change the deflation timing as well.

So gold, the actual "gold standard" of money, is not money?
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:47:44
Is store of value considered a use. Then pretty much everyone. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:58:17
Yeah but that doesn't change the fact its a financial mistake. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:34:39
The quote says money, not currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:41:48
Insured based upon the fact the insurance company stays in business. You are making a gamble when you insure as well.

For a lot of people you could take a 2 year vacation on that. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:11:10
Even if that happens, its pocket change for him. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:51:08
Yes I agree but I disagree he is "in everyones face claiming to be satoshi"
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:20:29
@_date: 2017-07-07 16:50:20
You're right. Looks like things have changed since I was shopping around. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:46:03
If you do your research you can put together who he is, and he has published opinions on the matter... And no its not Craig W. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 23:38:37
Lol luckily I haven't seen it. I guess his stuff doesn't get much attention which is good. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 16:44:49
If you plan on storing ether or litecoin as well I believe only ledger allows this functionality 
Edit- this is wrong trezor supports both of those as well. I don't think you will be disappointed with either product. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:51:42
While I don't think he is satoshi what so ever I don't think he has claimed to be him since his stunt in 2015 or whatever. He likes the limelight but I haven't seen him saying he is satoshi lately. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 02:02:49
I agree with everything you said there and my statement still stands. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:09:52
What if you have the private key memorized are you in position of them then?
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:01:24
5 years ago people said the same about $1000 bitcoins
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:47:09
I like Gemini but regardless after purchasing them get them off the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:56:51
There's no laundering or volatility in fiat /s
@_date: 2017-06-29 02:56:37
Provable how?
