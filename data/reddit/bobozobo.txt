I actually do not like that. The changing of context in order to compete with psychological sentiment is exactly why our current major financial institutions are so overcomplicated and fucked up. Too many spins and layers.
It does not get any simpler than multiples of 10s, and simplicity is divine.
Once we go down the path of successive definitions and buckets... we have lost the ship.

Huge bullshit. Taxation of the mining is ridiculous also. We need to fight this.

No. Fucking with formulas and spining numbers to imply affordability is why our current system is confusing as shit and easy to scam people with.
It does not get any easier than moving a decimal over. Why do we want to fuck this up already?

Gold has no intrinsic value, nor does the paper money is printed on. "Intrinsic Value" is a straw-man argument here when you realize the entire economic system has no intrinsic value, past the need to have a system for agreeing upon value, and a mechanism for having wealth propagate through the system. It is all imaginary. You think the bank has a real dollar in its vault for every entry in its electronic ledger?
Bitcoin may be vaperous, but honestly, show me an economic system that has not been able to be manipulated to transfer wealth. Shit, the entire current system just went through that in 2008, and we do it every time we print money to support the economic need. I have made more realized gains in 6 months of crypto than I have in 5 years of traditional investments; as far as my bank account is concerned, it is every much as real as the current smoke and mirrors economy.
Don't look now, but you are already standing on a rigged platform.

Gold has intrinsic value in industry, not in finance.

Tinfoil Hat - Institutions want to deflate confidence in crypto. Driving up the fire so when the short or engineered crash happens, they can say... told you so... stick with our model.
I'm still lovin' it.

Wanna buy a $500K home, despite making only $20K a year... no problem.

All part of the plan.

A broken watch is correct at least twice a day, but that does not make it a watch worth listening to.

Its not about that. We know government wants a cut, but the application here is problematic.

We have been fully indoctrinated to assign high numbers to all our needs. Mission accomplished. 
Hopefully we don't fuck it up with crypto and add multiple layers of obfuscated conversions to muck up and overcompliacte it like we did with our current systems. It multiples of 10s people... it's not that hard.

The doom and gloom is overstated.

Last thing we should do is create a psychological justification for adjusting the perception of affordability. This is exactly how the housing bubble happened, and why so many are confused and taken advantage of by current economic models and investment vessels. Too many conversions and shell games.
It's multiples of 10, its not that hard. The fact people do not know it can be divided is due to ignorance, not a misconception. Bitcoin and crypto never hid this feature; in fact it is one of its best qualities. We should be promoting understanding and use of current reality,  not a spinning of statistics.

That statement contradicts itself. If it doesn't change anything, then why do it?

Which was allowed to happen and be mismanaged without accountability BECUSE it was deregulated.

The Education Institution is overrated and you just proved why.
