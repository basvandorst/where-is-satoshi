I think this is being orchestrated by few who own a lot. Moving the price up and down so much and so fast for so long without any news directing it ... just can’t be “natural”.

We just placed a similar posts at almost the same time. Totally agree.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:59:57
Sources? Just look at the volumes. One of the ideas behind Bitcoin is that it’s not that easy to track the names behind the wallets. So, how could I trust any “sources” on this? Just look at the volumes (in USD) transacted.  Huge.

I really can’t think of any other better source.

I think you are in the wrong place to ask this. Most of the money, at least in 2017. came from big investors, not small fishes from reddit, savings or giving up a coffee or two ;)

From your perspective, as a trader, of course you will base your decisions on technical analysis, current market trends and your trading strategy.
However, I am not a trader, I entered Bitcoin (like many others) for totally different reasons. HODLing Bitcoin no matter what the market price is, just makes me feel good. And here is why:
Back in 2009 when this new currency was born, it was obvois to everyone that the global monetary system we have in place -  is corrupt. 
We had to do something which may, just may, start the process of putting an end to the global domination of, so called “financial industry”, big banks/financial institutions in the world which they excercise purely through their fiat money. Money which they have a control of.
And if we want to put them out of the game, we need to make them obsolete. Crypto is, so far, our best chance. A small one but nevertheless - still a possible way to at least start the process of decomposing this corrupt monetary system we have in place now.
So, yes, I am a HODL-er, I hope never to sell my Bitcoins for fiat money. And if I ever do, it certainly won’t be because of the market moves or price going uo or down for more than XX percent. I’m not into Bitcoin just to get more fiat money, I’m in Bitcoin in hope that, one day, we will get rid of fiat and the current banking system alltogether.  
And, as I said, it may sound like mission impossible, but still, current financial system is corrupt and if there is a slightest chance that it can be teared down one day, I want to be a part of it. 
Even if I don’t live to see it, just being a part of it, holding onto Bitcoin, holding onto this idea Satoshi originally had - it gives me that warm fuzzy feeling. Can’t help it :)

Satoshi is much better than bit. You can’t get confused with it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:14:15
Yeah. I guess less and less “small fishes” actually take the bite.  7% is still not bad, except that next time they sell, it won’t be at 75.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:17:14
 Hope this helps

Yes! :D

I believe that, at some point in history, whene someone said: "Hey, why don't I loan money with interest?" Someone else called him naive too. It's just a question of perspective. Changes happen. They always did and always will.

Why would I need to be a miner? How could anyone prevent me from taking Bitcoin in exchange for my services?
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:39:47
Who the fuck cares?! The whole idea of Bitcoin is the rebellion against the banksters , central banks and the whole financial elite no matter where they come from.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:37:45
I love your store. Looked at it through iPhone snd looks good. Designs are also cool. However, the prices under the items are stated in USD (only). 
If you really want to make a statement, I suggest you state the prices in Bitcoin only.
I understand your suppliers ask for USD, however if you could introduce some API and connect to some cryptocurrency exchange the prices could be dynamically adjusted to the current exchange rate between USD and BTC.
Otherwise, I fully support your effort, we need more shops and marketplaces which accept Bitcoin. That is the whole idea after all, to use it as a global currency to buy/sell goods/services ans eventually make fiat money less and less important in economy.
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:29:18
I believe in Bitcoin as currency. Anything that makes banksters obsolete sounds great to me and BitCoin is, so far, the closest we got to that point.
I would happily work for bitcoins and sell my products for Bitcoins. Just to rule the banksters out of equation. It's more like an idea to me. Idea worth fighting for.
@_date: 2017-09-11 11:25:17
So what if China bans trading Bitcoins? The future of Bitcoin was never supposed to be tied to what governments or banks think or do. 
Only we, the owners of Bitcoin can decide about the future of Bitcoin and the only way for them to stop us is to shut down the Internet.

@_date: 2017-09-11 16:14:11
I disagree. But, let's get more practical. Let's say, for instance, we have a global on-line marketplace for people who are willing to buy or sell various services with Bitcoin. Let's say I offer SEO services for Bitcoin and someone somewhere has Bitcoins and is willing to trade 0,00nn Bitcoins for SEO services. What can government do about it? 1. How will government know that you purchased SEO in the first place? 2. How will they know that you paid in Bitcoins? And how will they know how many Bitcoins did you give in exchange?

It will go to 5200$ area in 5 days.

I'm watching it on YouTube now. Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:26:11
Because there is a limited amount of it. And people are willing to use it.
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:41:36
There is no way for government to know that you are transacting with Bitcoin. Especially if you know how to configure your computer to browse / use Internet anonymously.

Wow! That's what I call "a spike"!
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:24:47
Here is one example:  how can government tap into this? They couldn't even shut down ThePirateBay or WikiLeaks. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 11:35:48
Well, my understanding of BitCoin and the reason I like it, is it's decentralization. Inability of banks and governments to control it or decide on it's faith. I see it as an act of rebellion against the financial elite that currently rules the world with a help of their fiat money.
Finally, my belief is that BitCoin should be owned and used only by those who believe in this idea and not by financial speculators who only see it as a way to gain more fiat money once they're "out if trading BitCoin".
Maybe I am an idealist, but I feel there are plenty if us out there.
