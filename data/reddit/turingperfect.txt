They're contraband snuck over the nK border into northern China.  Typically contraband only flows the other way, so for those who have an interest in nK there's not a whole lot of options.  The real question is what is the nature of OP's interaction w/ his sources (which of course he'd keep to himself!).

I see Bitcoin (the protocol) as an analog to the invention of the alphabet (combined with the ark of the covenant legend [which combine in a cultural virtuous cycle that had allowed them to persist to this day]) during the collapse of the bronze age. 100 years later and there were multiple competing alphabets.  But glyphs, (and the extreme command-and-control economies that relied on them) which dominated Mesopotamia were almost completely abandoned. 3400 years later and many alphabets are still around, many new but some still resemble their ancient origins.

Doesn't Bitcoin core still bundle cpu mining with it, just doesn't run by default? If all Asics suddenly went off (and all fpga's and gpu's), cpu's could still mine. But it would take a mighty long time to chew thru those leftover blocks before the next diff adjustment.

I don't think you were specific enough. A sudden drop in hash rate wouldn't affect btc block times significantly (as I understand it). but bcrash blocks yo-yo based on difficulty iirc, so quite possibly, but idk how much of a drop it'd take.

Not really.  Insider trading is someone who trades on information he came to through inside sources.  Fraudulently shutting down withdraws (which is what's being insinuated here), then selling other people's assets, then announcing a "glitch" once it's obviously too late, is called fraud followed by theft.
But u/sogood is right.  There simply isn't enough diversified information sources for daytraders to be anything other than an echochamber, primed for misinformation.  If you want bitcoin to be treated like money, use it like money.

AUR didn't experience a 51% attack by a multitude of disaffected miners.  It was hit with a gravity well exploit by one single miner by the name of BTCExpress who has extremely powerful rigs at his disposal.  He let what he was doing known, *then* worked *with* the AUR development team to find a fix.  He acted a bit like an asshole, but in the end actually helped the coin and went so far as to vouch for the dev team's committment to the coin.

I used zinc for two separate purchases totaling 7 items about a month ago.  I've received only one item from each purchase in that time and the Zinc staff, Max (u/maxko87) and Doug, have only given me the run-around since.  We're talking about items that are all in-stock on Amazon and I've asked for either a confirmation that these purchases will be fulfilled shortly or that I can receive a refund.  So far, nothing.  Their website's 'chat now' feature doesn't seem to do anything and no one picked up their telephone.
I had high hopes about this service.  Maybe someday they'll answer my emails and try to restore my trust.  Currently I'm out about $130 and no Amazon support.  For now, I'd say continue to use Gyft.  It's still the most reliable as the purchases are made through your account.

That is an AWESOME book that everyone interested in money should read.  It definitely establishes Graeber as an authority, but not THE authority.  And he does contradict one of his largest conclusions with his own evidence.  He says that (coin) money was made privately first (then goes about ignoring this point for the rest of the entire book and instead stressing that markets and money are always and inexorably linked to the state).  I thought it was bizarre that it didn't get a second mention.

Are you suggesting that the sun is going to create an EMP so powerful that it will crash the nearly-infinately redundant BTC network?  At that point, what other modern forms of payment would survive that you're suggesting we adopt?  If we suffer an EMP that size (we won't so it's not really worth entertaining, but for sci-fi shits and grins lets say we do), it's going to have a much more stark effect on the first world than it does in the third world.
Most of the world does have the capability to remotely store and transfer bitcoins.  Most of the world does not need to cold-storage them, and that becomes more true daily.  Most of the world does not need to understand how it works, as most of the world already doesn't understand how money works, yet they spend it just the same.
Bitcoin has some hurdles to get over in the third-world, but they're not of the techno-phobic/apocalyptic kind you forsee.

everyone sweatin' this dude's jock on the triple entry thing when the point of the article is that LN is analogous to double entry.  And that is an important point -- one that wasn't lost on Finney either.  The first time I read about LN several years ago, I immediately thought of the exchange houses and counterparties that evolved during the antebellum free banking period, which was essentially LN+Atomic Swaps for the 1840s.  That's what's awesome (and the insight the author's seeing); we have compelling evidence this model would work to scale before long before LN came along.  It was always the asset's security that was the weakness.  Anyway, dunno if blockchain is technically triple entry, always heard it was.  I liked the article.

It also matters that many in the west say "it's not profitable to mine bitcoin anymore" and leave it at that.  First of all, that is only a function of when you sell and whether you paid btc or fiat for your energy.  Second, even if you wind up buying from Bitmain or some future developer, you still get to choose which chain to point it at.  Thirdly, there are other asic developers for other chains out there.  I know it's not SHA-256, but Blake-256 and Blake-256b asics are coming out, and run under 500W.  Signal to the market that you want crypto asics for high quality decentralized chains and a &lt;500W SHA-256 w/ a 18 mo ROI will either come about or something else will fill that void.  Rising tides and all.

I'm not sure that clears up that much for me? What do you mean by security? If it takes higher fees/smaller blocks to achieve said security, it'll affect how much of a premium BTC users are spending on a coffee. To put it another way, no one expects the same security on buying a coffee as a house. If I buy a coffee in cash, I've paid before even recieving the coffee. If I exit the store and see my 12oz cup had 8oz of coffee I'm annoyed but move on.  Ive essentially lost 1/4 of my cash on that transaction but I invested literally nothing in securing that 1/4.  When buying a house, things aren't secured until everyone is satisfied. I'd be a lot more annoyed if I bought a 4br and get a 3br. That doesn't happen because everyone involved is concerned with their own self interest and those combined, competing self interests result in an expensive security apparatus called realtors.
Security first. That had always been szabo's angle, and he's right. Most everything else can be solved without jeopardizing security.

Fucking coinbase. It'll let me sell during the drop but suddenly needs me to reverify the id they already have on file to buy. Conveniently their id verification system is down atm. I'm sure they'll get it sorted out once we're back to $4300.

Yeah, turned out to be something stupid. Coinbase wouldn't verify my id unless I vpn to a US-based server because that's where my id is from. Thing is, I moved to Alaska a few months ago, which is part of the US. What do they think they're protecting me from if a. They don't even know that Alaska is a state and b. They're relying that bad guys don't have access to sick advanced technology as vpn?  Still going to use them because they're convenient but definitely not holding coins on that clowncollege exchange for very long.

So as a Coinbase customer as well as a Bitcoin core supporter (small blocker), what should I do?  I'm not even clear on the date for the whole 'replay protection' thing.  I've long been uninterested in LTC, but Charlie has been gaining my respect lately.
So, my thought is this: If I'm wanting to purchase bitcoin, but I want to try to signal support for core over Segwit2x/NYA, I'm buying LTC from coinbase, trading it for the 'real' btc on an exchange after the hard fork.  Coinbase does not get Seg2x action because they don't get any bitcoin action from me until I see a SPECIFIC non-2x BTC.

Whenever ppl post calculations on what btc's price one day will be I always remind myself of the most important thing: that there are only 21 mil coins ever, 15 mil millionaires and another 2000 billionaires.

One read of this I guess would be that liquidity in the private markets is drying up. If that's accurate, we could see some deflation (what CNBC is calling *disinflation* but I'm not smart enough to really great the difference). If we can't get any velocity even with additional liquidity guarantees in the market, it could extend for a while. Honestly, with all the indicators I'm used to basically completely decoupling, I have no read on wtf is going on anymore.

Their overhead is a product of both merchant revenue and consumer revenue.  With more responsible cardholders, they would (theoretically) shrink down to a size more in line with the revenue they receive from merchants.

Not that I condone this, but wouldn't we expect some of these people to simply file bankruptcy?  I know that there is a great deal of pride/shame at stake in something like that, but as we're talking about a heterodoxical community anyway, I could see many of them justifying it as in line with the goals of the broader BTC movement.  I personally don't see it that way, but I don't think it's a stretch either.
