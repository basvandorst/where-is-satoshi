No problem. And technically your not storing the Bitcoins on your computer. Bitcoin lives on the Blockchain. The only thing you store on your computer is the public and private key, which gives you access to the Bitcoin. But your fear is still irrational about “hackers” attacking Linux machines for Bitcoins. There are hundreds of individuals that don’t even bother doing it on Linux, let alone offline. They straight up do it off their Windows machine connected to the internet. That still has a larger target audience. But like I️ said, as long as you keep Ubuntu and your keys offline you’ll be fine.

Transfer your funds to GDAX (which is free because Coinbase owns GDAX). Then from GDAX move to a paper wallet to reduce fees. I️ never transfer straight from Coinbase to a wallet
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:40:54
It doesn’t matter what wallet you use. The coins are going to go back to its original wallet no matter what if it’s not processed on the blockchain. That’s by design of the blockchain so you don’t loose your coins (unless you send them to a wrong address). You just have to wait. The only difference there is between wallets is some give you the ability to set your own fees. Electrum probably allows that. Bread does that to an extent. I can select a premium fee which is usually a high fee to get my transaction through, or an economic fee that’s extremely low and takes longer to go through. Bread doesn’t allow you to type in your custom own amount. 
Another difference is some wallets allow you to rebroadcast a transaction, or accelerate a transaction using something called replace by fee, to get a unconfirmed transaction through. But I don’t know enough about those and how they work.

Definitely try updating your phone. New iOS doesn’t use the circles anymore to indicate the cellular reception. They went back to the traditional bars. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:56:38
Yeah I️ understand. Withdrawing the entire amount is gonna be a little hassle if you want to withdraw x amount from a paper wallet. But just use your Breadwallet for those transactions then. And use a paper one for long term storage. And I️ keep an eye on my paper wallet by bookmarking it’s public key onto my web browser. So whenever I️ add more BTC to it I️ just click on the bookmark to see its balance. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:48:42
I️ believe that .01BTC only applies to buying and selling on the exchange. Looking at my history I’ve transferred .0090227 BTC from Coinbase to GDAX, then from GDAX to a paper wallet before which is roughly $57 at the time. I️ also did  .00833705 which was roughly $50
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:52:19
I’m curious as to why you buy on Bitstamp and sell on Coinbase?

I use the Bread wallet for iOS.

Transfer the BTC over to GDAX from Coinbase. Then from GDAX move it to the paper wallets. That way you don’t pay the transaction fee, GDAX will cover that for you. It’s the same log in as your Coinbase info. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:16:48
For long term storage i keep 90% of my coins in a paper wallet. But on my Breadwallet i keep just under $100 worth of Bitcoins in it if i need to use them. A good majority of my friends have become interested in Bitcoin and having coins on hand showing them how it works is handy. But i would not keep more than $100 on there. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:09:02
Nope! It’s the same log in as your Coinbase information. Then when you click deposit there should be a tab for your Coinbase wallet. Just select that, then I’m pretty sure there’s a max button if you want to transfer over all your BTC to GDAX. Otherwise just type in the amount and it’s gonna be an instant transfer.

How safe and reliable are the iOS wallets listed? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:31:54
With Coinbase it’s safe to do so. They’re a registered exchange in the U.S and are forced to by law to collect identifying information because they’re dealing with money. Government regulations are trying to limit the amount of money laundering and other related illegal activities with crypto. Uncle Sam also wants his taxes. So if you receive or sell over $20,000 USD worth of crypto the IRS is gonna know about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:27:56
He wasn’t specifically speaking about Coinbase adding BCH. The host mentioned something about insider trading and how the price skyrocketed when Coinbase added BCH and how there is insider trading speculations. Roger mentioned that he thinks insider trading is legal and isn’t wrong and then went on talking about how consumers should be just aware in general where they do business. They should be aware of coffee shops, stores, and other businesses. 
He also said that he suggests users leave their coins or money in exchanges and not on a device like a Ledger. If there’s a run on a certain currency people don’t have to wait to transfer funds. They have their coins already on the exchange and can sell/buy immediately without missing out. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:00:49
I’d say Bitcoin is a “Brand name” that everyone associates with Crypto currency. Everyone “knows” about it but they don’t know anything technical about it.  If you told someone that doesn’t know much about crypto that you just bought some Ethereum, Cardano, Ripple, and EOS they’d think your making a bomb. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:24:47
Nothing major so far. They had a graphic declaring a Bitcoin Civil war with tanks and what not. The host explained were the divide between the two currencies are (block size, lightning network, and fees), and that was pretty much about it. The host said he’s not taking or favoring any one side of the argument or trying to sway users. He wants both to succeed and sees them both working together. He also owns both coins. Roger Ver is about to talk. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:22:34
Sometimes they do sometimes they don’t. I think it’s a bug with their app. Next time just send your BTC to GDAX. Then from GDAX to your wallet. That way you pay 0 fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:12:44
I may be wrong, but I’m pretty certain there isn’t a definitive time were the transaction gets dropped from the mempool. 2 weeks just seems to be the average wait time for everyone that gets a transaction stuck. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:43:16
The best description I could come up with keeping it short. 
Roger phoned in, and the host mentioned how Bitcoin core has the best/more developers supporting the network. Roger shot down the idea that Bitcoin core developers are the best saying they aren’t the best anymore. They destroyed the network making it congested and slow with high fees because they don’t want to increase block size. 
Conversation switched over to scaling both networks and how core and Bitcoin Cash aren’t even close to making the same amount of transactions as Visa. Host mentioned the Lightning core is developing. Roger said Lightning would work better on Bitcoin Cash because of the bigger blocks. Host asked what the plan was for Bitcoin Cash. Roger didn’t mention Bitcoin Cash's plan of scaling the network. Host asked can Bitcoin Cash become as slow Bitcoin core is now because of the amount of transactions. Roger worked around the question and said they want to provide the best experience to users. What bitcoin once provided in the early days. 
Roger thinks insider trading is not a crime. No regulation is needed. Buyers need to be aware of the services. Be careful. Don’t depend on government.

 * Step 1: Download a clean version of Ubuntu from the official website
  * Step 1a: Download a clean &amp; trusted open source paper wallet address generator from the official GitHub repository
 * Step 2: Transfer Ubuntu over to a clean, newly formatted bootable drive. Transfer over the wallet generator to a newly formatted thumb drive. 
 * Step 3: Disconnect the Internet definitely &amp; HDDs (which I think is over kill)
 * Step 4: Launch Ubuntu from BIOS
 * Step 5: Extract the wallet generator. Get your keys. Print them via USB and not over the network. 
 * Step 6: Shutdown Ubuntu, unplug the bootable drive and usb stick and get your PC back to running as normal. 
 * Step 7: That’s it! You have secure public and private keys. 
As long as Ubuntu never connects to the web it’s not going to be infected with a virus. You can even turn your computer back on (once you unplug the Ubuntu disk), intentionality download a virus onto windows, and boot back into Ubuntu, Ubuntu will be fine.  
I doubt you have some form of a BIOS virus/malware on your computer. 99% of BIOS viruses are involved in some type of Ransomware where they lock you out of your computer indefinitely. And besides, most viruses are intended to work with a specific OS, not the boot process, because people usually write viruses that takes the path of least resistance to work. And they aim for volume. Why would someone write a virus that will only infect ~50 people running Linux when they can spend the same amount of time, if not less developing a Windows virus that can infect thousands. But since we’re wearing tin foil hats let’s say you do have a virus that you can’t detect, and it somehow manages to mess with the OS, it’s not gonna mess with Ubuntu. Viruses that work on Windows won’t work on Unix/Linux based operating systems like Ubuntu. They are two completely different architectures.

That’s actually brilliant when done right. I️ never thought about trading that way. I’ve been thinking about ditching Coinbase/GDAX for something that’s a little more reliable when it comes to customer service and uptime. I’ll have to take a look at Bitstamp.

I️’m not too familiar with Cryptopia so I️ can’t give you an exact answer. But I’d imagine there would be similar, if not maybe slightly higher fees because your going from one exchange to another. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:37:58
Similar situation to yours. I transferred BTC from GDAX to my paperwallet and the status is ~~complete~~ pending when I check my account history on Coinbase. But it still hasn’t shown on the Blockchain. Coinbase does have degraded service currently. I would not worry though. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:59:47
Holy fuck! A 6.2 BTC fee!?!? Please tell me that’s a typo....
But anyways, It happens. You live and you learn. Just need to be patient now. I just took a peak at the mempool and it’s about to cross 300k unconfirmed transactions. So unless you really need to move that BTC, I’d just hold off for a little while. It’s gonna take some time for all the congestion to clear out. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:14:41
If you send it to GDAX first, then send it to your wallet you won’t pay fees. GDAX pays the fee for you. It’s the same log in as your Coinbase information. Do that next time.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:29:13
Plus they roughly have 200 employees, but yet have 100,000 new users sign up per day. And I️ think they do fairly well with all the influx. I️ can’t imagine what their CIO is going through.

If you go to their website, and not the app, you’ll see your fees before you buy. I’ve found their website to be more reliable. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:31:33
What do you think is different?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:51:04
If you do still end up using coinbase, move your BTC to GDAX. Then transfer them to wherever you want. That way you don’t pay any fees to move your coins. GDAX pays the fees for you. They’re owned by coinbase so you use the same log in as your coinbase info. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:28:41
The other day i placed an order and got the confirmation screen, but never an email. Traffic was extremely high like it is today so some of their services where degraded. i ended up getting my bitcoin in the usual 5 days. Transferring to my wallet also took a while. The transaction didn’t show up on the Blockchain for a couple hours but eventually passed through. Don’t worry your good. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:26:12
Not OP, but my coins got stuck in limbo for 8 days this week since it’s been so crazy. I just got them back yesterday. And 2 weeks is the default time for them to be dropped from the blockchain. It may happen sooner.

I’m in the same boat as you. I’ve been using bread for about 2 months now and I’ve always used the economy mode which made the fee a few cents. My transaction always cleared within 1-2 hours max. I sent another transaction 3 days ago with a 10.398 sat/B fee and it’s been stuck in limbo. I guess I just got unlucky this time. We’ll just have to wait it out two weeks until it gets dropped and sent back to the original wallet. All the transaction accelerators are backed up as well. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:10:24
I had a similar thing happen to me a few months ago, and it was like a 3 step process to get my account unlocked. First step was answering the security questions they give you. Mine were all along the lines of “How many bitcoin do you have”, “What is your XRP address that you deposit to on Binance”, and one other one. Fortunately for me I was able to log in to my Coinbase account and look at my previous transactions to get addresses and the amount of crypto per wallet I had for the questions asked. Step 2 I believe they sent me an email to confirm my password restoration. Step 3 they had me upload my photo ID and a picture of myself holding a piece of paper with the date written on it with the text “Please disable my 2FA”. Then about 30 minutes later I had an email in my inbox with a link to turn off 2FA and to reset my password. Without being to answer those security questions I don’t know how much more help you’d be able to get.

I’m so sorry to hear that. By no means am I a safe expert but I don’t think any residential safe would have withstood that massive wildfire. Safes are usually rated to last only 30-60 minutes in ~1700 degrees F. That wildfire was probably well beyond that. You’d have to spend a fortune on a safe and keep it in the basement to have a shot at keeping the items inside safe.

I’d be carful with a fireproof container. Especially fireproof bags. I’m not sure what you got, but those aren’t meant to be stand alone fireproof. Bags only last minutes before the seems start to deteriorate. And the small containers are basically garbage when it comes to being theft proof. If it isn’t a pain I’d return what ever safe you bought and buy a fireproof/waterproof safe and use the fireproof bag/container with the safe. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:55:41
If it’s just a fireproof bag then yes. The items would essentially start to melt from the heat alone after a few minutes. Most bags don’t even close completely. It’s just Velcro that holds it closed. After about 25 minutes the seems on the corners start to give way if the bag is exposed directly to the fire. Once the seems go might as well not even use a bag at all. Thats why you’d want to use the bag with a fireproof safe. Fireproof safes have a foam gasket between the outer metal shell and the interior walls. That foam acts like a shield preventing the safe from basically turning into a oven and cooking everything inside.

That’s what I used to make my cool looking paper wallet. Haven’t had any issues with it yet. I even bought the $10 kit that gives you a plastic bag and holographic stickers to seal your private key. When someone opens it, the seal breaks and you know someone’s looked at the private key. That website is a fork form bitaddress.org so both websites do literally the same exact thing. Expect one looks cooler.

Are you using their mobile app? I had the same issue verifying the amounts for a week trying to do it on mobile. If you didn’t get locked out saying wait 24hrs to try again, trying verifying it through their actual website. Worked like a charm first try when I did it that way.

Wait, does that mean future purchases of BTC through Coinbase will be segwit2x after the fork? Or is that just for the fork since they own the keys, and segwit2x purchases would be separate from BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:49:23
I did not. I’ll have to look it up since I didn’t get any emails from them. Let’s say I do get them, how would I go about selling the new coins since I’m not interested in them? I moved my coins out of Coinbase into my own wallet. I get that the private key I have will exist on both chains, but I don’t want to accidentally sell my BTC.
