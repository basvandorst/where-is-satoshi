I definitely believe in Bitcoin and the future, possibly the better tactic is use some FIAT to buy on major dips over the next few days? Or just hold onto FIAT and see what happens. I got a nasty feeling it will hit 12k for some reason.

I got all the time in the world to be a day trader, we will see how the competition goes when it comes to being successful at it when it could get wild.

I meant I have read about it, not invested in it previously I could not predict those dips happening so dramatic and sudden. Everybody makes mistakes I suppose.

If it goes under 12k, I am losing at that point that is the only reason I am thinking it might be a good idea and be patient and buy back in, who knows? Direction needed.

What makes you think it will be 20k? I would really like that but with all the effects coming into play tomorrow it's sketchy.

I knew somebody was going to say that, and truthfully I don't but when somebody predicts something 3 like Peter Brandt it's a concern because his recent Tweets have indicated his just recent prediction is on the true side.

Yeah, I have enough FIAT to pay my CC in Full not concerned about interest.
I considered that and putting FIAT aside to take care of myself.
If it goes under 12k, then I will be not profiting is the point I am making I think I am just going to ride it out, if it goes to 10k I will be 2k under and I have belief that this rocket ship will take off.

Yeah, if I only bought on the 15th of November :P

I could see that for sure, 8k though would be UGLY...

I appreciate that repose, I have enough $ to cover my CC transaction so I am not worried about it building interest and being out of my comfort zone I just don't want to get burned when I could of sold, profited and reinvested with my profits.
