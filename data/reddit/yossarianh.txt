I stick around because I am genuinly curious how cryptocurrency's will evolve.
And the endless cycle of theft and smuginess is hilarious.
Half of the community get their coins stolen at service X, the other half is smug as fuck. 'That will teach you to trust service X, I only use service Y'.
Other half of the community gets their coins stolen at service Y, the first half is smug is fuck 'Did you learn nothing from the X debacle?'
And now people get their coins stolen because they downloaded some .exe of the mtgox theft because some random dude on the internet said it was legit.
In which universe will a system like this ever get accepted on a large scale? If people who handle BTC on a daily basis and have a firm understanding how computers etc work get their coins stolen, how will my grandma ever be able to use this system?
And yet people still advocate large scale adoption of BTC.

What did your family member say when you asked him about bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-13 11:42:40
Or vandalized.

Well, using BTC to transfer funds withing their organization as you propose is not a smart idea. If it is hard to get 100k usd into lets say Mali, then yes, it is easier to get 100k usd worth of BTC into mali. But there is absolutely nothing you can actually do with 100k usd worth of BTC in Mali or any other conflict ridden country. 
Add to that the risk of BTC losing its value. They will lose a lot of donators if they have to admit they lost millions on BTC transactions.

That doesn't address any of the points I was making, but I do appreciate the downvotes :)
Bitcoin is facing real challenges and if you want to overcome those, you will need more that stupid one-liners. Bitcoin is technology, and like all technology it will get obsolete. How will BTC look in 10 years? In 50 years? Will there be other crypto's then who are technological more advanced? What position will Bitcoin have in that system? Is all the money invested in BTC in 2014 still worth anything in 2064?
These are the questions on a more abstract level that BTC will have to answer and that is why I stick around.

eli5. how can I verify that the note actually contains x BTC?
@_date: 2014-11-25 12:36:11
Bitcoin also has a huge startup cost, as you need to invest in a dedicated linux machine thats off grid to keep your bitcoins safe and need to store paper wallets in a safety deposit box at your nearest bank office.
It is always neglected here. I wouldnt be surprised if the avg bitcoin had been stolen at least once.

If you want to give money to charities, why dont you just donate money to them?

This. All the notions here of Mark stealing the funds are absurd. It is 500M USD he would steal not only from some internet kids who say nasty stuff on the internet but also from drug lords, pedophiles and god knows what criminals more. Wasnt part of the Silk Road indictment not conspiracy to commit murder or something? 
The reason Mark looks terrified during all the press conferences is because he probably is, and not because this subreddit posts nasty comments.

eli5, what would stop me from emptying the wallet using the private key and then passing the note along?
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:23:46
People have been losing their coins in exchanges and online wallets for YEARS. The history of BTC is riddled with these 'one time incidents'. I made comment in a different thread about the inability to secure large amounts of BTC in our brick and mortar world. 
As long as large amounts of BTC are being held in single entities and wallets, people will steal it, run with it or get robbed of it. There simply isnt a way to secure it in the offline world.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:52:01
Because he runs an exchange?
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:23:55
Well, I did. The underlying problem is security. As it stands it is impossible to secure your funds 100%.
Targeted malware and viruses can wipe out your wallet. It doesnt even have to be grandma that executes the funnyscreensaver.doc.exe. People could exploit a zero-day etc. It is not a risk that is worth taking with a lot of $$$.
Then there is security in the brick and mortar world. If you have a lot of dollars worth of bitcoin, you better not tell anyone. If you win a lottery you can tell people about it. The money is probably safe, split around in several saving accounts, bonds etc. If you have a lot of bitcoin you better keep your mouth shut. If anyone finds out they can easily strongarm it from you. They will laugh at your 256-bit encrypted USB in a fireproof safe whilst they beat you with a $5 wrench till you give up. Lots of USD in BTC is the same as having it in cash or gold. Possession is everything!
That is why it was so stupid of Newsweek to try to find out the real identity of Nakamoto. It is not like revealing a big lotterywinner, it is like pointing out a dude who has access to 500 million dollar in cash! Same goes for Mark Karpales. That dude also had access to 500 million in  'cash' so to say. I honestly wouldnt be surprised if it turned out mobsters stole all the BTC, threatening his family or some other sick shit.  
You could print paper wallets, store those in safety deposit boxes but if you go shopping around with paper wallets, why not use cash money?
For me, BTC has merits. Want to donate a small amount of money to a charity/piratebay/random blogger etc. Why not use bitcoin? It is ideal.
Want to make a small purchase on the internet on a site you dont trust with paypal or cc credentials? Why not use Bitcoin?
Want to make a micropayment in a mobile game? Why not use Bitcoin?
Want to buy a beer? Why not use cash?
Want to buy a car? Why would you ever want to use BTC for that? There already is a monetary infrastructure in place that is excellently equipped to handle transactions like that. What could BTC possible improve?

That is because changetip on reddit is a terrible idea. If you start rewarding posts you like you create a hive mind where people all post along the same lines hoping to catch some tips. People will post for money and not to participate in a discussion. It is a step into nickle and diming stuff that used to be/should be free.
I dont know if you saw the Winklevoss slides but they as well want to nickle and dime the shit out of everything. They coin the phrase 'emailcoin' to legitimate spam, and 'speedcoin' to get priority in traffic.
You dont need to give people money for things they say/write/share on forums or social media. It will create a dishonest internet.
You can however pay money for content and services and maybe there is a niche for bitcoin in that area. Focus on that.
@_date: 2014-11-18 12:24:02
Charities have excellent infrastructure to handle donations.
Spamming social media with changetip makes it look sketchy, like you have an hidden agenda (which there actually is; pumping BTC).
Buzzwords like "crowd funded microtransactions" dont get you anywhere. Wtf is a crowdsourced microtransaction?
If you actually spend 1 minute researching the charities you would have seen for example that amnesty has a $35 minimum donation on their donation page. Ask them if you can donate a lower amount with bitcoin.
Having 100 redditors throwing btc pennies at them really wont help your cause.

Bitcoins biggest flaw is that you cant secure it in the brick and mortar world. If you walk around with 1 million USD worth of BTC the criminals will laugh at your paper wallets and encrypted USB sticks. They will buy a $5 wrench and hit you with it until you beg them to let you give them their bitcoins. Nobody stores huge amounts of cash money at home and no bank stores hundreds of millions of cash in an ordinary office. 
Yet mt.gox had 500 million USD of BTC with one guy having the key to it. I sincerely wonder if all the 'missing bitcoin' isnt just stolen by mobsters and mark cant speak about it because they would do something to him.
BTC cant be secured in the offline world because possession is everything. If you own the BTC, if you have the private keys, you can spend it. Regardless if it is stolen or not. 
You have no safe way to store BTC in the real world. Safest way is to put it on paper wallets and safe it in safety deposit box at a bank. And if you do that, why use BTC anyway?
@_date: 2014-11-25 13:07:10
Both options are not cheaper nor easier than paying a banking fee.

Can anyone explain why I am getting downvoted? 
Imo this was a sound discussion. If you guys want to promote a redditwide tool that rewards discussion you should at least be able to actually have a reasonable discussion in your own subreddit without going into full downvote modus.

So if one person goes rogue, or passes away the BTC is lost forever? 
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:48:43
BTC is in many aspects a way to go back from the wheel to feet and horses. We go from a society where money and possession is safely stored on an abstract level (proof of ownership is all that counts) to the dark ages where people hide their gold and silver under the mattress (possession is all that counts).
The latter might seem more appealing because grrrr big banks but dont come crying if some baddies stole all your life savings. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:07:23
There is a huge difference between a military operation and a for-profit exchange system. You could count the people who benefit from rogue launches on the fingers of one hand where as the amount of people that wants to steal 500M USD is lets say, quite significant. 
In the fiat banking system it doesnt make sense to strong arm people in giving up their banking information because funds will get frozen or leave a paper trail. You can steal cash during a bank robbery but not a single bank has 500M in cash lying around. Those that do probably have military level security. Same with gold reserves.
@_date: 2014-03-02 15:16:51
What I have been wondering about for a while is this: Possession is everything in BTC. If you have the BTC in your wallet, if you have the private keys, you own the BTC. This holds true regardless where the BTC comes from. It could have been stolen, embezzled whatever, if you have the BTC you can spend it. There is no mechanism in place that can freeze BTC, no way to mark BTC as stolen or tainted. 
If Mark Karpeles has/had access to 850k BTC, wouldnt that have made him a huge mark for crime? I mean, it is like literally sitting on 500 million USD of gold in your basement. Just strongarm the dude in giving over the keys and you own all the BTC's that have been trusted to mt.gox.
How can you ever secure BTC on such a high level?

The lack of safety is a huge issue for btc. I have been following bitcoin since 2011 and literally every exchange since then has fallen over, has been hacked, has been 'hacked' or lost its pw or something stupid.
So storing btc on an exchange is a bad idea.
So you store it on your pc. Every once in a while ppl come on this subreddit that they got hacked and lost all their lifesavings. 'Solutions' are always about buying dedicated hardware, off grid machines, really elaborate pc security and/or paper wallets.
The avg layman is not going to invest a few hundred dollars just to keep his btc safe if the local bank does it for a few bucks/month.
And if we get on the level of paper wallets, well, why not just use cash...

No, you reply to them with facts. That is how a discussion works.
