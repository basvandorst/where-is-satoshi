Yes. I guess that could happen without malicious intent (if they have power outage) but if it happens randomly, over time this should even out (meaning you'll get paid when others are disconnected).
If you are under DoS attack you probably can't run a node (or do a lot of other things on the internet for that matter). I'm not sure how a node would be able to prove it was under attack and under what conditions a fine could be appealed. Do you have any ideas?
I guess it's similar to one large miner DoSing other large miners so they can't broadcast their blocks. I wonder if that happens.
Thanks for bringing it up.

Great question :)
Similar to Bitcoin, Enigma is a peer-to-peer network of computers. The network forms a decentralized "cloud" which can be used to store, share and analyze data. Every piece of the data on the network is encrypted, and can be used without ever being decrypted.
The encryption used in Enigma is called 'secret sharing' or 'threshold encryption'. Data is split into different pieces which are by themselves meaningless, only when enough of them are joined the data is decrypted. Think Multi-Sig address.
The way computations are performed on the data is more involved, and uses a protocol called 'Secure Multi-Party computation'. Using complex schemes, different nodes on the network can use the different pieces to perform every possible computation without assembling back the data.
Enigma uses bitcoin to pay fees, security deposits to punish malicious nodes, and also to manage access control to data (Address X allows address Y to use datapoint

No really. To the best of my knowledge, Storj is 'Decentralized Dropbox'. Enigma is not only for data storage, but also secure computation. If you're looking just to store data, StorJ is probably a better solution. Sharing the data or performing computations on it, to the best of my knowledge, is outside the scope of Storj.

There are a few major differences. 
* Ethereum is a blockchain and has its own cryptocurrency, Enigma doesn't. 
* In Enigma data is private where in Ethereum everything is public. 
* In Ethereum every node processes every transaction, in Enigma the computation is distributed.
Some of these are not necessarily benefits as much as tradeoffs. For example, in many cases you want code and data which is publicly verifiable which is something Ethereum does great.

Yes, security deposits and fees.
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:09:33
Yes. Enigma is private protocol to complement the public bitcoin blockchain.

Maybe, probably not. PoW requires a function that is 'Hard to Compute, easy to verify'. Now there are ways to verify the computations are correct without doing it all over again, but the ratio will never come close to hashing functions. Also, not sure how you could control adjusting the difficulty.

For a node to become a 'miner', it needs to make a security deposit to a smart contract.
A 'fine' is given in two events: If a node lies about the results of a computations, or if it exits the protocol prematurely (in the middle of a computation). The fine is distributed to the nodes who were honest. These violations can be proven objectively so there are no means of appealing a fine. There are more details about it in the whitepaper.

So hopefully, since we're doing general computation, the advantage of specialized hardware will be relatively small. Sure, a data center is more efficient than a home computer, but not a million times more efficient. 
The complex schemes have to do with the way computations are done. The basic example is adding x+y, where x and y are distributed between n nodes. They are encrypted in a way so X1+Y1+....+Xn+Yn = X +Y. Each node computes their function and sends the result to whoever request the calculations.
Hope it helps.

Thank you!
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:12:43
Thanks for the feedback. I guess the reason we chose it is because that's what we're trying to eliminate.

We don't have an estimate on what the profit margins will be, obviously it has to be more than zero for Enigma to work.
I would hold on to buying hardware until we have some empirical data. For starters, we think everyday computers should be enough.
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:55:14
Yep, need to find a balance. Make it cheap enough so everyone can mine and expensive enough to prevent attacks.
Note that even if a node decides to cheat, they cannot reveal the data. All they can do is lie about results of computations, or abort computations in the middle (and waste the resources of other nodes in the network).

it still is and will be a mining operation
@_date: 2015-05-01 00:32:41
This is not the idea, for sure. It's ridiculous. How are consumers supposed to install this chip into their electronics? How can that ever compete with mining operations in Iceland?

It's a min of 1MB.
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:47:38
No man.
If &lt;whatever&gt; is larger the 1MB, &lt;whatever&gt; would be the limit. 1MB is lower bound.
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:15:30
It doesn't prevent a DoS attack. Can spam the network and grow the blocksize infinitely over time.
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:30:25
Yes, it is.

For certain type of computations (ie, machine learning) GPU is definitely better. We probably won't do it off the bat (a lot of other stuff to worry about) but it will probably happen in the future.
