Silly conspiracy, doesn't make any sense.

In bitcoin and all coins, except for primecoin, the solved algorithm is useless besides generating the coins, it's just a way to add scarcity.

The reason is very simple. Almost no employee, and maybe none, knew about mtgox real situation, mtgox just processed some withdraws, as it always have been, to create the ilusion, to the consumers, and their employees, that Mtgox is not a scam.
If employees realize it's a scam, many will talk. The longer it takes to them to realize that, the better for Mark.

I've got to ask, why don't you guys support alt/BTC pairs? Like LTC for BTC and Doge/BTC
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:27:50
And the red color is because it's unconfirmed, it will change color after 1 confirmation
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:58:35
Nope. But it's a good option also.

Only people who lost money on gox would agree to this. And do you really think they make up the majority of bitcoiners?

Satoshi registered the domain bitcoin.org using cash in the mail to be untraceable back in 2009. 
Do anyone actually thing he hasn't careful as to never expose himself, like not using tor, since the very beggining?
It doesn't matter if all databases he was registered as satoshi nakamoto were compromised.

Genuine satoshi will use his personal mythical wallet to donate 1000 bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:16:04
Does it really matter? He didn't say anything that nobody knew. Newsweek was wrong
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:48:14
That is what he is proposing. And yeah, no one would agree to that.
@_date: 2014-02-23 06:17:13
So you lost all your coins because you didn't make a backup and then because you trusted mtgox? Gosh, learn how to properly secure your bitcoins.

It can be bip38 encrypted and a new one printed, but after that you have to shred the old paper walet.

If it's as simple as asking, I suggest another line of aproach
1) Did you create bitcoin?
I'm such a genious!
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:40:54
There are three possible reasons he wouldn't come clean at this point
1)Gag order
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:26:27
So much reasoning, so much precognition
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:29:04
Leah McGrath is racist.
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:50:10
Yes, sure, let's just throw away 800k in the hope the gov. doesn't arrest us and courts recognize bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-01 08:18:18
Even if it's cracked they still need access to the private key. So what?
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:47:47
Building a pc from dark matter right now

In the long run they are far better off mantaining the service than running away with the clients funds, but once the domain is seized and they are wanted/arrested, and some funds frozen, guess what will happen? Of course they will run away with all the money they can.
So, can we really say the scam was perpetrated by them or was it the police that made they do it in the end?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:00:55
So you can pretend your coins weren't lost on mtgox?
@_date: 2014-03-01 08:49:01
How would people get to your card? If the algorithm is broken, they still need direct access to your card in the first place.'
I'm not even mentioning the fact that it's unbreakable...
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:18:57
It means he as alive. So what?
5 words saying that he is not that guy doesn't mean he is back. And of course he is lurking bitcoins communities, who wouldn't in his place?

Would you bet 2/3 of your life savings on poker?
I'm guessing no.

And now we are mostly running Windows 7/8. The bitcoin protocol can also be updated. And one bitcoin from now will still be worth one bitcoin then.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:26:37
You are confusing decentralization and regulation.
