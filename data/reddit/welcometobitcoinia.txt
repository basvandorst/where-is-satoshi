From the link below ( it appears that if you have 21 bitcoins your current rank is 73,592th.  
For 7 bitcoins it is 107,079th
And for 1 bitcoin - 194,439th
From over 2 million bitcoin addresses, the large majority of them have fewer than 1 bitcoin.
Most interesting of all to me, to make the 1%er category in bitcoin you need around 50 bitcoins.  But I see there are almost 30,000 bitcoin addresses with amounts between 49 and 50 bitcoins.

That has been a really good read.  Thank you.

Where do you get this data?  Is there a way to see more information about this?  Thank you, best response so far :)

Holy crap I can't even comprehend having the kind of cashflow that would allow me to have so much money on hand.  My savings are not even that much at the moment (in USD equiv).  Thanks, I will check out local bitcoins.

I should have clarified that I meant people with a non-zero balance of bitcoins.  While this is a very exciting and new development in commerce, it is certain there are not seven billion people with bitcoin wallet addresses.
I am also starting to wonder if any businesses are using bitcoin with other businesses.  So for b2b transactions. (sorry that is a completely separate question!)

The number of rainy days I have been alive for is low.

What I would really like to know is how many bitcoin users are there at the moment and what the spread is like of wallet sizes.

That makes a lot of sense!  I had not figured that out myself but I guess this would be from before the halving to 25 bitcoins per block (there is so much to learn!)
