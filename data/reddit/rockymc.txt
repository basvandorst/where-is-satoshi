This subreddit moderators were removing posts that were in favor of BitcoinXT. So yeah it's not a choice.
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:21:40
I'm pretty sure I got shadowbanned from this subreddit because I posted a few things supporting Xt, and then criticizing the mods' decision (specially to censor supportive Xt arguments.
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:19:11
I just hope that you are brought to justice. Now I know why Moolah purchasing MintPal was a bad idea. Too bad the other staffs realized it only when the damage was done.
@_date: 2016-01-21 03:18:40
They should start by removing RBF. It didn't get a good approval rate on the community, but still the Core devs literally said "fuck it, we're adding RBF even though our community rejects it."
I find it hard now to Core devs implement a bigger blocksize after impelemnting RBF even though the community did not want it.
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:27:27
Yeah, I think it's time to move to litecoin. I get 0.0001 BTC/day, and wouldn't pay fees because my money is limited. Thanks to this update, my zero-fee transactions will take 10x more time to be processed.
@_date: 2016-01-17 22:32:27
Just increase blocksize instead of increasing fees. Updates like this makes me think that Core developers do want to throw new users away from Bitcoin by raising the fee.
@_date: 2016-01-16 10:46:23
So, the general consensus here is to increase fees until it reaches high levels, basically keeping new users out of Bitcoin?
I got your idea, but I don't think it is better. Nothing is stopping spammers from filling up the blocks to delay tx time and increase fees too.
We need to find a better solution.
@_date: 2016-01-21 12:21:00
Introducing something to make it easier for users to fraud payments is not something good :)
@_date: 2016-01-21 03:22:51
But certain moderators that "moderate" (more likely to dictate) the communities newcomers go to have the power to regulate discussions. It's what is happening here, we have an abusive moderator which simply hides any content that tries to tell bitcoiners about a new client that implements new stuff that Core can't/won't.
TL;DR: people like can make users not adopt a different client than the one he thinks is the best for his personal needs.
@_date: 2016-01-24 02:37:30
Lol, I clicked thinking the author was criticizing Core developers, but he just shares their point of view. Anyhow, it's good content, but you just got a downvote for baiting.
@_date: 2016-01-13 12:16:58
Thanks! I was really confused about it.
@_date: 2016-01-07 14:49:00
Some dumbass resetted the page...
@_date: 2016-01-13 11:47:36
Hey is lukejr's fork also considered an altcoin, according to your logic? If not, why?
@_date: 2016-01-13 11:56:14
Guys, don't forget about Coinbase listing that was removed because they were testing BitcoinXT. It is another proof of censorship.
I understand that Brian Armstrong tweeted that he had the intention to switch to XT, but removing the listing is wrong. An official statement should have been required before removing the listing.
@_date: 2016-01-13 11:59:56
Just because a fork is a softfork, it means the fork isn't considered an altcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:29:24
Because Core developers think 1MB is enough, even though we are almost hitting the limit.
Long story short, they won't listen to the community, and if you try to promote a Core fork that fixes this issue, your post will be censored.
@_date: 2016-01-07 14:47:49
Did you have to sort the remaining letters to form a phrase/word? Or did you just input them?
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:25:59
What is RBF? and why was it implemented in first place since everyone in the community didn't approve it? Do Core developers even read this sub?
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:08:33
should step down from all Bitcoin community roles he has. He should also step down from managing bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org (if he does manage it).
Just a joke: bitcoin is controlled by chinese miners, and we have a community government that censors us! I think bitcoin is indeed socialist..
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:12:03
Could someone explain what segwit is?
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:04:36
You have a point, but some things he said are indeed true. Bitcoin is failing because we can't reach a consensus, because we can't share our opinions if they don't support Core.
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:59:07
I haven't seen any posts being censored on Voat. If they are the same person, we can either a) ignore it, because Voat has a transparent moderation log available to everyone or b) ask a Voat admin to remove mod powers from him.
@_date: 2015-08-17 02:57:58
I'm sorry but I have stopped reading your post after this line:


Obviously you didn't inform yourself about XT, or you are just trying to get this wrong information to the users in this subreddit, so XT isn't adopted.
This is clearly a moderation abuse. XT is not an altcoin, and will never be one. It is just a fork from the original client.
Also, can you please answer if Electrum and other light bitcoin wallets are also altcoins? Because, if XT, which is a Bitcoin wallet, is an altcoin, what are these? Please explain.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:43:12
Just move out of this subreddit. Some of the moderators do not support BitcoinXT, and therefore will keep deleting comments about the client.
There is [voat]( if anyone wants to join.
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:40:49
Or just move to Voat. (registrations open at random times throughout the day)
@_date: 2015-08-12 17:06:15
Despite the expensive part, isn't BitLicense good? It's trying to differentiate legal bitcoin business from illegal. I don't think it is bad anyhow if we forget the fees.
@_date: 2015-08-12 21:25:30
Ah, well, I forgot that part. Is it bad because it requires a bunch of unnecessary private info from the company's customers?
@_date: 2015-08-13 00:45:01
Do we even follow the "1kb = 1024byted" notation?
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:00:09
but it has transparent moderation logs and no censorship (afaik)
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:12:25
40 minutes since I posted the link, and yet it wasn't removed! Can we beat a new record, guys?
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:58:11
I thought they were already accepting registrations. Sorry if I let you down.
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:32:55
Thanks for clearing this out. A few years ago I do remember that 1GB = 1024MB, but now I see that this is the correct representation (1GB=1000MB). TIL.
@_date: 2015-08-13 18:33:23
Is this post still hidden/deleted?
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:44:03
The registrations open up at a random part of the day, afaik.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:14:53
This post was removed guys.
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:15:53
Thanks for letting me know!
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:50:15
Why not accept litecoin dev pull request? It would fix this?
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:52:59
2) yes it wasn't, but that's what going to happen eventually.
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:39:08
Wow, is this guy a mod? We need to remove these bad admins from the subreddit administration. I'll probably be shadowbanned because I said this. Let's start a riot. Let's boycott.
@_date: 2015-07-13 11:43:27
Whenever I pay with bitcoins, I can see that my bitcoins are sent to the destination address and another address which I never heard of. What is this last address? Miner fee?
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:29:10
You're getting blocks filled with spam transactions, when you should get blocks filled with normal txs.
@_date: 2015-08-13 17:36:19
That works too.

Let's get this to the Reddit team if this does not end well.
@_date: 2015-07-13 02:59:05
what would be a good source of cryptocoin news? I always read CCN or Coindesk because I can't find any other trustful source.
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:42:01
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:33:03
Do you suggest them to host their own git server, which would pretty much suck because it wouldn't offer the same things GitHub offers?
Having a repository be taken down due to DMCA claims does not make a software/website centralized. [Here, take a look.](
@_date: 2015-07-15 00:55:11
tip me
@_date: 2016-02-09 12:36:39
If they say they welcome a fork that offers 2MB blocks, and Classic adds 2MB blocks, that means they are going to support Classic, but it doesn't mean they will only support classic.
@_date: 2015-07-22 12:24:44
I've seen an article talking about this, it was the first one I read, and the litecoin founder said this vould've been prevented a few years ago (2011), when he submitted a Pull Request that would fix this issue. Sadly, the PR was rejected.
Why can't they simply merge it now?
@_date: 2015-09-21 19:47:27
Raspberry Pi + Bitcoin in it = $399.99.
Damn no, I prefer trying to make my own version of it, by only spending $35.
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:20:28
I'd rather pay $399 for this secure, open-source hardware, than to pay the same amount (or close enough) on a Raspberry Pi with a shield everyone can do with electronics stuff bought from China, for less than $60 (yes I'm talking about that "computer" that had a shield to "handle bitcoin").
@_date: 2016-10-13 13:30:42
Wow, you are really willing to take hard measures to fuck up Bitcoin, good job. If you end up doing this, the whole point of Bitcoin being open source ceases to exist. We won't be able to contribute to it anymore.
@_date: 2016-10-23 13:19:17
Can someone explain how increasing blocksize centralizes bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:00:08
The post content was just removed. What happened?
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:24:48
For the same price, you can get a better "computer": 
Really, who will pay $399 for a Raspberry Pi with a fancy shield atop of it? Just buy an ORWL instead.
(disclaimer: I am not, in any way, affiliated to the ORWL developers, I'm just a bitcoin user)
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:47:49
Have you considered replacing BTC with any other fiat currency (USD, GBP, EURO, CNY... any currency), and asking yourself the same questions you just asked on your post?
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:04:58
~~Let me see if I got it right: it got reported for massive downvotes coming from people from this community?~~

And who are you to think your decisions are good for Bitcoin? I didn't know you were Satoshi Nakamoto to control Bitcoin. I know that you own the majority of Bitcoin communities, but that doesn't allow you to choose what's good and bad for Bitcoin.
Removing posts about "altcoins", as you say, is only bad for Bitcoin because no one will know that there are other clients out there. They won't know how to judge what's good and bad for Bitcoin because you are removing posts that offer a different opinion than yours.
You're not Satoshi to decide what's good and bad for Bitcoin, nor a Core developer. The community should decide, and with their opinions, instead of being blind followers because there is content regulation in these websites.
@_date: 2016-07-28 13:43:51


This is just false. Everyone is using WhatsApp because it's practical. They wouldn't migrate to Telegram if their "security" (Facebook probably has a backdoor in its encryption) was void/removed. They don't care at all with what the government and companies do with your data, they use the "I have nothing to hide" argument.
@_date: 2016-07-29 13:29:40
You could invite Theymos for a beer, after all you don't care about free speech. I wonder if he will let you talk your ideas, though.
@_date: 2016-07-29 13:14:50
Why wasn't this removed yet? @_date: 2016-07-27 01:33:33
as well. Thank you for making Bitcoin what it is today.

And for the hacker to overpower the network, he must own 51% of the hashrate. We all had the 51% fear since Bitcoin was created. And tell me, is it cheap to own 51% of the hashing power?
