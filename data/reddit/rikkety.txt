Silk Road 2.0?

There's a Dutch website for ordering food, pizza and stuff, which accepts bitcoin.

That doesn't mean a thing. 
I don't blame you, though, there's no information, so we're stuck making it up ourselves, i guess.

Being *very* generous, I count 5 out of 11.
That's about the same as I count for reddit in general.

But who's going to take my Jim Bob's Specific Bucks?

I think you meant "shame".

Brand logos appearing on xtc pills include: 
* Nintendo
* Facebook
* Android
I'd say we're in good company.

Excuse me for highjacking your thread, but can someone explain to me, did the *actual price* drop to 102, or was there just one dude that happened to sell at 102?

Weird article. It reads like the author found out what Silk Road is/was just yesterday and had a deadline today.

This has little if anything to do with the currency. It's mostly the hype around the event that's driven up the price. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:29:52
It's consistent with the timeframe "soon-ish", though.

Already got ripped off once, you can be sure it won't happen again.
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:34:03
Are you serious!? Are these people actively trying to piss off their customers now?
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:01:14
You're forgetting drug dealers were among the first to embrace bitcoin. They represent a significant amount of the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:59:45
Aha, so, both. That makes sense.
So, everybody's probably putting in ridiculously low buy orders now, in the hopes that the exact same thing happens again :-)

Or, 48 percent points, alternatively.
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:45:29
That's just beyond stupid, even if you're not an expert on bitcoin.
