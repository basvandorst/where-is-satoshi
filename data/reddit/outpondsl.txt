 OF A FUCKING BITCH! WHO JUST BOUGHT A SHITLOAD AND ROSE THE PRICE? I JUST GOT PAID TODAY AND WAS ABOUT TO PUT IN 50 THOUSAND, BRING THAT SHIT BACK DOWN RIGHT NOW OR I'M PARKING THIS MONEY ELSEWHERE. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:24:12
This is true. I'll just hodl onto my money till the 4k drop and then come in, and if it drops down to 3k I'll throw in 100k on top of it. Fucking assholes trying to raise the price before the rest of us can make our moves.

Oh I still have plenty of Alphabet stocks, I just felt it was a good gamble to convert a tiny fraction of it into crypto. Cause if this continues, it will dwarf my alphabet hodlings in less than 3 years.

You'll get there one day buddy, just keep putting your money away in stocks, bonds, and crypto; then one day you'll be able to move those investments around and put them in faster growing vehicles or safer slower growing vehicles if you choose too. I made this money thanks to putting all my money into investments in my younger years when I was working part time jobs like lifeguarding, waitering, and being a clerk. It took some time, but eventually it starts snowballing into a behemoth of wealth that you won't know what to even do with. If your lucky like me you'll be able to retire by the time your 40. Unlike my old classmates who are all still slaving away in a 9 to 5.

When bitcoin falls bellow 0 dollars, it rolls back to 9,999,999, dollars. It's the opposite of an Odometer rolling over. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:26:52
Oh I'm hodling, I just wan't that 4k and maybe 3k dip so I can increase my positions. Took out 300 alphabet stocks I had just so I could make this move.
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:11:47
Still killed unarmed. You can see it's a fucking glove from the chopper footage so those fucking pigs could definitely see it's a glove from 10 feet away.
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:45:35
Hopefully it doesn't kill the site in the long run. My fear is people will make an account not understanding they have to subscribe to things to create their preferred feed and then ditch it when they leave not knowing what to do.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:05:05
Sounds like the cops in my neighborhood. Good guys those cops, [killed my unarmed neighbor with 12 bullets in a firing squad style murder]( they were found innocent when they investigated themselves too.
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:02:52
Thank god it's back down to 0 now, fuckers had it up to like 50. Thankfully I put out a text to some friends who helped it get back down. Should be safe and able to collect my 3 bitcoins for this bet in a few hours as long as this post stays dead. Had to give up .01 bitcoin to get it down but hey I still will be making way more!
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:13:09
When you have friends who have alot of bitcoin like yourself, you guys make stupid bets to try and take some of their coin. Not my fault he took the bet, nothing illegal about it. It's the reason the saying "a fool and his money will soon be parted" exist.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:35:01
You are awesome! Keep this chain going! The worse you make me look the safer my coins will be! 
*Haha fuck you Zack told you this dare wouldn't work! My bitcoins will be safe you Zimpy eyed fuck, ~~just kidding Zack love you, you also owe me 3 bitcoins for this bet bitch.~~*
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:12:36
Of coarse now your mad because it wasn't a lie and doesn't back up your belief that cops treat everyone equally. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:42:30
I'll let you live in your ignorance as a person thinking there is an excuse to shoot an unarmed father 12 times making sure his daughter will never know who he was or that his nieces and nephews will never see him again.
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:19:32
Hit him with a stun gun if necessary, Omar was unarmed. No reason to fill an unarmed man with 12 bullets unless you believe he has super powers that are a threat to your life. Does my childhood long friend look like he had super powers to you?
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:56:31
What's apple juice? As that another lean mix? Haven't tried it yet but I'm down.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:29:54
I do? I don't remember that, must've been redditing while I was supper fucked up. Would explain my leaky bunghole though.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:31:57
Oh I'll still donate, just not 10 bitcoins as long as this post stays under 10k, and by the looks of it I should be good!
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:08:11
 I know how reddit works, as long as someone doesn't bridgate this post to some other subbreddit to give it life then this will be the easiest bet I ever won, also the easiest 3 bitcoins I ever made. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:15:01
Default subs have been gone for about a year now. New redditors start with 0 subscriptions on reddit ever since they changed it. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:21:18
You denied it at first and now your upset it wasn't a made up story like you were hoping it to be so it could follow your narrative. Not a fucked up conclusion at all. I'm the one who lost a childhood friend and your the one calling it a lie like all the people calling the florida student crises actors. Fuck you.
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:09:17
I'm only donating it if this gets 10 thousand likes. Without 10k likes I'll just donate my usual donation value.  
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:06:46
Sheer stupiditty of hodling will get you a long way buddy. The smarts that make you sell during dips is what will fuck you. Got all my friends in this game years ago, the smart ones took their money out way too early, the retards like me who had the lowest gpa's in highschool are now loaning them money so they can pay us back with their fancy jobs at stupid interest. I rather continue being a hodling retard than a selling genius.
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:26:22
So being in a police chase means your a threat to someone life after the fact while unarmed on the street? Guess I can sh00t O.J. then and be clear by your standards, hmmm.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:30:55
That's the spirit! Keep it coming! With comments like this I'll be able to keep all my bitcoin instead of risking it on these dares.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:38:59
Haha yeah broke. Hope you get out of the broke game one day buddy! Just keep hodling and one day you'll be so bored you risk 5% of your stash for shits and giggles, also because your buddy Zack bets you 3 bitcoins that this would go bad for you. So as long as it stays down I make 3 btc to add to my collection!
@_date: 2018-03-10 15:58:22
Who says I didn't buy? I buy every dip, EVERY DIP.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:15:20
does it still have the bank safes?
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:14:33
This is what I was waiting for people to say
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:49:53
Guess you don't want any bitcoin to be donated to charity, fine with me. 


@_date: 2018-03-06 20:57:53
I didn't remove the post? If it doesn't stay up for 24 hours then I can't collect my 3 bitcoins! This post is never coming down! I will even print and frame it for the 3 bitcoins it forced my buddy Zack to lose.
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:05:35
They would have to look at r/all to do that. r/ all is the new r/home sub now.
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:18:36
I hope you have the blessings to hodl long enough to be where I'm at one day. Even though you preach such hatred towards me I wish you nothing but the best! Hopefully you'll be a rich upset man one day instead of just an upset man! Good luck with life!
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:00:31
Good thing I didn't have to earn it. Just had to hodl. You should do the same and maybe you'll be at the value of what 10 bitcoins is today one day, hell maybe you'll even get to the full value of all my bitcoins if you hodl long enough. But by then I'll be a lot farther along as long as I keep on hodling. Good luck buddy!
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:54:37
Doesn't look like I'll have to donate 10 bitcoins after all!
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:11:25
What details did I remove? Everything is still up. Just click on the full thread and you'll see the details, when you go to a response page like this then it doesn't show the details but they are still there if you look at the full thing
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:26:19
Thank you so much! I'm getting scared because of the assholes who are uping it.
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:11:06
Rust me, if your alreay at 8 bitcoins your only months away from 100k again lol. your 2 years away from over a millions. Just hodl on.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:16:12
There are no more defaults, reddit stopped that about a year ago. New redditors start with no subscriptions to any subreddits
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:13:54
The best system, I really respect those pigs when they pull me over and point their guns at me as soon as I reach for my license. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:20:26
Meanhile I'm 16 in highschool with 100k in bitcoin. It's thanks to [reminders like this]( for keeping me on the train.
