Also if many BTC are "locked away" either by hardware wallets, exchanges or lost keys. then aren't we nearing the supply is drying up phase?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:26:56
No no, what I am saying is that the days of insane volume trading means that people are trading/buying to hold....More and more people are HOLDING....so that means that if there is a daily volume of say 250,000 BTCs, we can assume that 5% will be stored offline or kept away to HODL. What I am saying if there is that much volume traded daily, with a max supply of 12million BTC available NOW, then wouldn't that drastically drive the supply down and the price up? I hope this makes sense...

I like Doug, and also have been playing poker for 10+ years (cash games mainly) and have come across Doug @ LATB before as well. But Doug is just riding the wave that crypto is (aren't we all?). He is somewhat entertaining but again he is making these videos for advertising and also to promote his website. Its all about making money folks.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:34:08
That makes sense, but also a lot of people buying a locking up the coins...
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:20:59
What I am asking is that Gdax for example has 72k BTC 24hour volume. So that means that in the last 24 hours that 72,000 BTC's JUST FROM Coinbase have been exchanged one way or another. I know many people are HODLING, what I would like to know if there is say 250,000 BTCs traded each day, many of the people buying/trading are HODLING....so that means that the supply will/should run out soon?
Apologies is this post doesn't make sense. I will try to explain in more details if needed.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:35:29
It just seems that is just on Gdax that 25,000-100,000 BTCs are traded daily, then what is the supply of coins "available" for trading vs locked up ones? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:41:11
Would love that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:44:24
I hold many coins.

Wait until they release them, it'll push BTC past 19k TODAY.

Newer ones do have rolex etched inside the bezel, i forget the years but i believe sometime in the mid 2000s or so. Older Rolexes do not have this. I know because I have a few "vintage" datejusts. One of the main identifiers is when the top of the L in "rolex" matches up perfectly and right in the middle of the base of the crown and then the top of the crown to the 12 marker.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:02:15
agreed, but considering the fake bitcoin add to coinbase, i think that this HELPS bitcoin.

I'm thinking at least 8k by fork time.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:37:12
it won't sit at the same price for more than 2 days at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:07:28
4k? LOL. Last crash was due to china, JPM, BS FUD and scared money. With CME, various financial industries, CNBC/Bloomberg constant coverage, major hype and hysteria now....the most it'll "crash" will be say from 7.5-8k down to 6-6.5k AT THE WORST CASE.
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:28:27
16,000,000 / 7,500,000,000
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:45:18
No way. Reason why the bigger dips happens was because this was the wild wild west, it still sort of it but much less risky. the riskiest phase was before it was stable over 2k. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:05:10
Sorry, i posted that 20 days ago on reddit. Posted elsewhere 2 months ago.

when u convert to fiat with a bank they will be able to "tell" based on previous deposits, etc. but this only applies to people with $.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:31:48
you think it'll go down a ton?
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:15:07
Thanks, but the one I'm taking about had estimates for 2018, 2020, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:40:26
BCC is getting stronger (right now) reason why is BTG was a flop (for now at least) and BCC is an actual working "product" and has been stable and has uses. I also wouldn't be surprised if BCC hits 800-1k in a few months.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:06:36
i love how these idiots think btc price increase is a sure thing all the time, lol. people like you will go broke.

This is a binding contract. There is a penalty fee if you keep your left ball, the fee is to send bitcoins to each redditor who read or commented in any of your ball eating threads.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:29:34
FIAT will always be there, but then bitcoin will be there for EVERY FIAT..... BTC = store your money, fiat = convert to use cash (if you need that). Im sure you'll be able to use BTC for everyday purchases too on the LN and other add ons in the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:38:27
but with what you said this won't be a sell off or BTC and won't dip, it'll ONLY make it much more $. the ATH will be at least 10k by 2018.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:44:11
so .0001% of the worlds population put in $ in bitcoin and many of the investors don't know what this is and what they are doing? So that means when the smart investors and people with $ come flowing in this won't BOOM the price?
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:46:17
LOL. unless s2x is rebranded AS THE BITCOIN, you are wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:43:07
I don't want to reveal my strategy for the upcoming fork for now. To your earlier point, 5k is gone for ever unless this whole crypto thing flops all together. 6k is also iffy at this point. Just wait until the christmas time with this. Also my info has been 90% right so far, only slip up I have so far is i thought alts would rise by end of day today.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:31:36
thank you, but I think theres another post maybe?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:32:58
Coinbase will have another app for large exchanges/transactions, "Coinbase Pro" or something... There will also be BITCOIN physical exchanges (think of a brick n mortar) where you can send BTC to and they convert to actual FIAT on-site or deposit in your fiat bank account.

this is EXACTLY what I posted 2 months ago. Were at 7k, you can buy a new motorcycle or a used boat or car or a trailer to live in. This isn't $3780 territory where its "a lot" but not "that much", at 7k, its not TOO MUCH for the majority.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:35:25
no significant dip. ASAP coinbase sent out the email a few days ago regarding the fork, the sachs interview and the CME interview...its going crazy, at this point I'm not surprised it it hits 8k+ by the fork, the split may result in BTC going down to lets saw 7k, and the s2x being around 1k. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:47:11
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:13:40
i think that due to "some of the smartest investors" being old school money aka real estate, stocks, etc. This is a new field that they are not sure about because its new. Were a digital world, digital currency is no brainer.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:43:31
I only have a "few" but its very exciting!
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:53:48
it hit 6k on coinable, i even took a screen shot. 100%.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:51:58
ok 7-8k then
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:30:48
WAIT FOR THE 2018 DIP! this has been well documented don't buy now!  buy later!
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:26:17
Does that mean that I will receive what I am owned as part of the november fork? Would that mean that I can realistically expect it somewhere in 2018 or 2019?
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:44:52
better now instead of never
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:43:02
thing is, who thought over 1k overnight?
so anything can happen.
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:44:57
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:49:11
please just buy now and shut the fuck up, unless you're buying bitcoin(SSSSSSS) as in a lot the dips won't affect your $200 deposit.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:54:16
its ONLY going to get crazier. Less available BTC because everyone is holding = SKYROCKET price.
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:36:28
HAHAHAHAHA keep your few bucks kiddo. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:33:19
i would be surprised if the average is over 1. no way.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:44:52
Oh I agree with you, get on the train at any stop you can, however what I mean is that with everyone fearing about bitcoin about not having enough, mentally, if you have more than 1.0 you feel better. 0.0938432 just doesn't do it, or even .932849.
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:35:02
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:14:41
thats what i think as well, that gold will not be the standard any longer and btc will be the wealth status symbol.life is uncertain, they said flying was impossible then 50 years later were on the moon, anything can happen.
I'm sure there will be cute names like bitcoinaire when that happens too.

@_date: 2017-10-21 06:33:18
if you put in 100 NOW you will be a multimillionaire. its so simple. and you're 18? its gonna be at 1 mil per bitcoin by 2020 and 10 mil a coin at 2025, you will retire by the time you're 17!

you will go back to the future marty mcfly style. We all will wear matrix goggles and pay via bitcoin phones. The phones are not actual phones for talking to people, but to call the master bitcoin race to beam up to the motherland of the 21 million club.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:08:44
EXACTLY what i am doing. I also have a shit load of alt coins and check picks daily, I almost never sell or trade either unless I hear news that a ceo is leaving, or the project is now shit.
Its funny when people freak out about a small 400 dip and panic sell. I was around before even the 4800 down to 3k dip, NOW THAT WAS A DIP and caused a lot of panic.
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:37:10
just by doing this for a little while off reddit, know using reddit many subreddits for additional info, its much easier.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:21:12
Ah ok, jut wondering i thought that due to my account size they sent it to some people. I'm impressed with CB and happy that they are doing things to keep the btc community going without any bad press.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:57:25
I don't have FOMO either. Im at a point with my BTC portfolio that I am happen and don't need to pump any more into it. Watching the price ride up and down is fun now. What I'm saying if the people with FOMO thinking its way too late to invest that just 1 coin is all you need if you can get it. If not, any investment NOW will surely pay off at least a bit in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:48:12
VTC and LTC for that. but yeah i wanted to buy some cheap coins now and it seems ill pay extra
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:31:22
i know there might be a dip soon, I'm thinking from 7500-8k down to 6500 then run up again.
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:21:51
localbitcoins.com or even eBay.
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:00:59
a - coinbase
b - authentic bitcoin will release an odor from your hard drive indicating that the bitcoin is safe and sound. its actually asleep until you sell it.
c - you can store offline

i just love being deep in the game with a few coins and every 100 increase is a lot more if you know what i mean.
