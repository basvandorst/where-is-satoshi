Had been thinking of this for a while. Legislation as a repository, with the ability to blame and diff updates and commits to it

Having a TTL for laws would be great

That too

Seriously, how much energy is the mining community using? Heard estimates that is was approximately equivalent the energy usage of some small countries.

Ya, imagine have a repository stored and commits added via the blockchain

Do you have proof of this?

Alirght, glad you reformatted the original post. Thought you were claiming responsibility

Also a developer. I'm curious, who would you want to control Bitcoin if not for the developers working on it?
The bigger issue that I've seen through all of this is that the actual development of bitcoin conflicts directly with the ideology behind bitcoin as being managed without any central authority, as this sub's sidebar states.

Check out the sidebar :P

Based on the video posted in this thread of someone trolling him and acting as a bro of Kanye's, I don't know. 
Also, that stream is painful. He's asking the girl what she is studying, etc.
During this whole event, his tweets have been in all caps
Also, if he really did just lose $15 million, the way that he appears in the stream is so calm, like it's nothing. Maybe he's trying to be nonchalant about the whole thing, but then again, why have ALL CAPS OMG WHERE'S MY MONEY tweets and titles, unless you're trying to grab attention.
The whole thing is weird, but if he lost the money, I can't say I'll feel bad for him.
@_date: 2016-02-14 07:29:24
Ya, I think he actually just lost $15 M...grab some popcorn, guys
@_date: 2016-02-15 06:31:39
To be the devil's advocate,
Instead of having many little doors scattered around that many people can set up, we'll have a few giant doors that few people can set up and make the market for setting up doors more of an oligarchy than a free market, which goes against the fundamental idea behind bitcoin.
Not saying one is better than the other

Just take down the entire wall

Uh, they trying to be playing like MT G.

I've pulled the project and read the code. But having never worked on similar systems, it takes a bit of working to jump into it and understand what's going on. Oart of the reason I'm working in the side for a better system to visualize and map large systems.

Shadow Coin ftw

Sorry, was explaining the sudden drop
@_date: 2016-05-28 16:36:50
The market corrected itself. The Supply was selling at too high of a price and the demand sharply reduced
