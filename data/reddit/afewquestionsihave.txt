Sorry for being a bug in your ear but how do I regulate the fee?

I don't know.  This is all french to me.  I started buying small amounts of bitcoin weekly and now am being hit with this bitcoin/bitcoin cash thing.  I am confused a little and obviously worried a bit.  I dont have a ton of money in it but enough that I would be upset if I lost it or it devalued significantly.  I usually buy through Coinbase and then transfer it to my wallet.  Will my wallet be affected?  
I guess the reason I am asking about coinbase is that they aren't on board with the fork.  Is there a chance that Bitcoin Cash replaces bitcoin completely and they miss the boat? 
As you can see, I am lost here.

Is there a way to bypass the fee every time I move money to and from my wallet or is that just the price of doing business?

I always transfer to my wallet so it should be ok then?  Also do you recommend a specific paper wallet?

Lets say I only have original bitcoin in my wallet and bitcoin cash wins out.  Do my bitcoins become worthless?

Breadwallet and Coinbase

I have a wallet, I guess my question is if coinbase isn't participating in the fork, will I not be able to make bitcoin cash transactions?  Will the bitcoin in my wallet automatically be transferred to bitcoin cash or how does that work?

hahah... Enjoy your viruses. Thanks for the info, I really do appreciate it.

Ah, I use iOS... I use breadwallet currently but am considering multiple wallets.... any of the ones you mentioned compatible with iOS?

I'm sorry for all of the questions, but I am a neophyte at this... 
So technically If I purchase $1000 worth of bitcoin at an ATM that accepts cash to BTC conversions I will be given a paper wallet from that ATM correct?
If I keep that paper wallet, in a secure place of course, there should be no record of that cash existing as mine correct? 
Then, lets say I would like to use $500 of that cash, I should be able to go to a BTC ATM and transfer the Bitcoin back to cash without any traceable record of it being mine and receive a new wallet with the balance, correct?
My only exposure would be if I were to lose the paper wallet and/or the BTC market were to slump the money I am holding in BTC would lose value, however if it were to appreciate I would also reap the rewards of that appreciation without any associated records, correct?

No Crimes, and I'm pretty sure, amounts under $800 do not require an ID so technically I could periodically xfer $800 without having to show ID.  
What are the best smartphone wallets?  
Also thank you for humoring me...

lets assume it is hidden.  how can I securely transfer cash to bitcoin without making it known that said cash exists and then how can i securely store said bitcoin and spend it? 
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:40:55
once the cash is on the wallet, how do you spend it or xfer it back to cash without it being discovered?
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:39:57
Is there a way to directly xfer cash into a wallet?  And if so how can I securely store a wallet and use said cash from this wallet if need be?
