He's trying to compare how much was mined in 1 day vs how much was auctioned.

No truth here, just a lecture on what makes a good currency. And why btc is better.

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of dept,
I take a look at my bank and realize that I've been spanked
@_date: 2014-12-18 04:17:08
Yeah true. I just figured it could hekp liberate the poor more than enable the rich. Pretty short sighted on my part.

This is awesome. If you have ever visited Indonesia (or Bali at least), you'll see how ubiquitous Indomaret is there. It's pretty much part of the landscape.

Ah.. Mobile chrome makes setting the url difficult at a glance

"moving to a world beyond cash ..etc.. Transparency, security and simplicity"
Being the President of MC (South East Asia), he has clearly demonstrated that he does not understand a thing about Bitcoin. This is pure and simple propaganda.
Is there a video of the president of MC North America (if one exists) clearly showing that they don't understand Bitcoin as well?

Is it normal for the y scale on these kinds of charts to go up exponentially? Why not linearly?

Governments will not use a method of transferring money that every citizen can watch and track. But who knows, they may be smart enough obfuscate their trail.
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:43:57
How is this real? Lol
@_date: 2014-12-18 07:15:46
Its not a troll. Just a someone new to bitcoin who needs a few answers. That's all. Thanks to you though, we've probably lost another one.

This is great, but how will those in the counties they are targeting actually get a hold of bitcoin in the first place?
@_date: 2014-11-27 07:34:44
Yeah... A different wallet app. I found out how though.
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:04:13
Man i can't look at this guy's face for very long before getting enraged.
@_date: 2014-12-18 04:41:21
I never claimed "only". Just that it could help bring btc's usefulness mainstream. 
Hell, criminals and the poor have been some of the best innovators in the past so it's not a first.
@_date: 2014-12-18 04:27:09
That's what your trying to avoid.. Essentially. I'm pretty sure criminal or corps only put what is legal into back account.
edit: That was a dumb comment but i think you know what i mean lol
@_date: 2014-12-18 04:17:50
I guess. But could this not act as a wake up call to speed up the development of the patch?
@_date: 2014-08-11 12:37:35
Those are Chinese labour hours you're using. Not going to be the same in the US....way more expensive.
Edit: Sorry, you calculated staffing requirements, not cost of man hours.
@_date: 2014-11-27 06:35:11
I'll give it a shot. Thanks.

"mining a technology or mining a financial service away from my control" LOL
"I don't understand why anyone has a need to be anonymous" LOL
@_date: 2014-08-28 12:46:49
TY! I was about to post to ask what the hell those pads were.
@_date: 2014-12-16 21:20:31
Wow, this makes bill payments abroad so easy. No need to exchange btc at 2 different exchanges anymore. Woo!
@_date: 2014-12-18 06:51:47
You may be right, but unfortunately you're a dick too. Users like you make this sub a shit hole for everyone else.
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:51:39
Man, this is old news...
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:34:26
I'm indifferent actually. I just want to be able to use bitcoin effortlessly.
@_date: 2014-10-01 19:36:25
Thanks! I'll need to check out these options. I always feel a little worried that i might miss click something, or forget to save something and poof, all is lost.
@_date: 2014-12-04 12:32:47
This seems like a good compromise or at least a step into the right direction. Yes, it still requires a central authority but it could pave the road to a complete trust in Bitcoin. From my own experience, older people (35+) have a hard time comprehending or trusting something that is completely virtual. 
I think most people still prefer a central governing body (or don't have the mindset/desire to be autonomous) and a service like this can bridge the gap. Once that gap has been overcome, we're on our way to a crypto-only society. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 08:28:47
What? I said he may be right. I'm not trying to argue his point. I'm calling him a dick because he's a dick. 
Feel free call him a great teacher through the use of condescending language if you want, but wait... that might change the subject.
@_date: 2014-12-10 15:58:28
Ironic isn't it? Storing bitcoins in the institution it will replace.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:38:16
Thec Fed Is separate from the  government. It's a private entity in for profit. Look it up. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:55:37
This doc really outlines how and why we've plunged into debt. I can't help but think that if we had a bitcoin economy, this wouldn't have been possible. In fact, products would get better and cheaper rather than cheaper and and worst.
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:01:04
Seriously? Any what will they do, ban any traffic that is encrypted? Too funny.

Great video! He brings a lot of the main points to support btc to light using MC as an example.
@_date: 2015-02-08 03:39:23
Send like you're more expensive than spendbt.com. but them again, you offer much more at the moment.
I'll be using a combination of you two i guess.
