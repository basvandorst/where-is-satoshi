CMC removed tether now from their ranking.

I always wondered when people assume bitcoin will be one million dollars if it is due to bitcoins increase in purchasing power or due to the dollar losing all its purchasing power (inflation). I mean we could reach one million in 2020 but still not be able to buy a lambo :-(

No they dont.

It seems that it only affects Tether pairs. Look at volume of tether. Is this the tether bubble bursting?

You missed my point completely :-) When bitcoin hits one million in 2020 there is a possibility that the purchasing power might be lower than it is today. So one million american dollars in 2020 might be worth a thousand american dollars in 2018. So you might not be able to buy a lambo with one million dollars in 2020 even though a lambo only costs \~200k right now. 
You can compare it with the venezuelan bolivar. One Bitcoin was worth around 100 000 bolivar in january. Now one bitcoin is worth 1 700 000 000 bolivar. But I cant buy more stuff with 1 700 000 000 bolivar than I could with 100 000 bolivar in january.

 looks short term bearish (1-2 weeks) and long term bullish to me

dunno I would rather live in a future where everybody can be transparent about everything without corporations exploiting it, than being forced to 100% privacy because everything you give out will be used against you.

I never used crypto paper trading but you can paper trade on tradingview (might be a subscribtion perk though).
Other than that bitmex has a testnet here is a guide how to use it.
As an advice stay away from leverage while paper trading. If you get lucky a few times it might give you the illusion of skill.

Its not the leverage that is the problem. 50x leverage while risking only 0,5% of your account is not an issue.
The issue arises when people try to 50x their whole account or when they start with 0,5% and add more and more instead of cutting their losses.

Why are you so salty about tone?
He is one of the few analysts out there that is giving free TA. And he is not even shilling ICOs and shitcoins which could make him x times the amount of money he is making. He is providing a free service and is asking for affiliates (which have no downside for the user).
People are fans of his because he is mostly objective in his TA and rather than giving clear directions he gives people his views on probabilities.
Besides his TA he also provides the community with interviews and his recent podcast the law review. He has literally lawyers and professors on that show talking about law specific cicumstances in the crypto space.
I dont know what has happened in your life that you become such a bitter person but i hope it all works out for you one day.

hence my wish to live in a future where that is not the case :)
