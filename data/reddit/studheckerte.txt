Unless China piles up their miners and burn them they will most likely sell the hardware to others who will use them to mine..

Do safe things increase 1600% in year?

I am pretty confused too. I just love when famous people not involved who don't know anything give their stupid opinions... then the sheeples believe them and spread FUD like wildfire.

I don't think anyone can truly 'ban' it and here in the US I think they would have a really hard time finding a legal footing to attempt it.

The fix will be in more efficient technology and green energy. In the US and Canada some big miners are just using hydro, not a huge footprint there

I had a spider sense that something was coming and went 100% into FIAT a week ago. Going to wait things out on the side lines, build a few mining machines and let things settle down a bit.

If you make money, you get taxed, this shouldn't surprise anyone anywhere.

Saying the price will never go above 10k is ridiculous. Adoption and awareness are always increasing, bitcoin is better and more recognized today than ever before and a week from now that will be true again. Eventually usage will grow to the point where demand will force the price to higher highs. This is just a slump, all markets have them...

Impossible to sell without affecting price...
