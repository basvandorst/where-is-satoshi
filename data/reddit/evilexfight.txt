Jesus christ, dude.  
 
Explain to me how its a certainty..Explain how its a sure thing.  100%  because that is what certainty and sure thing mean.
How you know that Crypto will be dominant over all fiat or other currency.  And how you KNOW that it will be BTC and not another form of crypto or other type of future currency that will erase BTC.
Explain that
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:26:33
So you mine all your bitcoin then?  Because if uou dont youre paying a fee just to have bitcoin.  
Transaction fees will exist in any form of currency that requires in exchange. Otherwise nobody would support the platform. Not only that but you have to have internet access to even use Bitcoin which is a charged all on its own.
And if you think rewards are a scam then you're just idiot like most of the crypto people out there who are just hoping to make a quick buck and don't really understand the technology. As long as you pay off your statement every month there are no fees to you. I get 5 or 6 free plane tickets a year just using a credit card for my daily purchases and paying whatever bills will allow me to use a credit card. Only stupid people carry balance is on their credit cards

Put it this way. Jeff bezos has 110 billion dollars.  Thats .001% of all dollars on earth. He is the wealthiest private citizen on earth.  
Having 25% of any currency would allow you to artificially increase and decrease supply raising and lowering the value of currency on a whim.

Its the same argument. Blockchain is what makes crypto useful. And its value is based on faith and scarcity. 
Blockchain has demonstrable value in both currency and non currency applications.   Btc could die tomorrow and crypto would go on using blockchain. but if blockchain was found to be flawed crypto would cease to exist.

Thats why they need 100 of them. Price would go up. But if they did it properly in the style of a hostile takeover where they bought up over time to gain a good percentage and then when people started to get wise they buy all at once regardless of rising prices to get a portion significant enough to be able to artificially manipulate the market

Do you understand that there are costs associated with every form of currency or payment? 
Cash has to be counted, transported, guarded. 
Credit has 3% fee. 
Bitcoin has cost to acquire and if it never gets s form of credit it will have similar fees. 
Do you think for 1 second that visa will not be in on the btc credit game when it takes off?  Do you have some belief that the world population will suddenly become tech savvy and financially savvy and take the needed steps to avoid these types of convenience fees?

I dont understand how you need an article or paper to explain to you how 1 person or unified geoup owning 25% of a currency would have a stranglehold on any economy that relies on that currency. 
You could cause rapid inflation or deflation simply by dumping currency into the market or by pulling it all out.  Being able to manipulate value by 25% could devastate import and exports respectively. There is a reason the yuan was forced by the imf to peg the yuan to a reference rate before it could be made a reserve currency.   
You could read basically any article on international finance regarding currency manipulation to see what im talking about. 
I agree with you 100% that nowhere near 25% is necessary wreak havoc on the economy.  But its common sense to state that if someone controls 25% of something leveraging them out would be  difficult in the extreme because any attempt to equal their position could manipulated by the 25% holder.  
"Oh you want to buy btc? Cool ill pull my entire liquid position out of the market and prices spike 10% immediately."
Followed by others doing the same as nobody sells on the way up.   Prices will skyrocket especially with this hostile group buying every bit of liquid btc on the market. 
Then trading spaces style they wait til they feel the price has topped out and dump 25% of all btc onto the market and watch the price plummet. 
Then take their stake which they sold at the top and buy back in at the bottom...
Maybe they increase their position in overall btc. Maybe not. But whomever bought on the way up is crushed. 
Thats just economics.  
@_date: 2018-09-18 22:00:22
I should have been more clear. Explain how it will replace it with no fees.  Itll be the exact same thing as a credit card.

Im not gaming anything. Im taking advantage of the awards program. That program is designed to attract people to a high interest card who will run up balances and keep them on the card.

I get the points and then pay it off. 
Visa makes bank off the morons who carry a balance and i get free flights. There is additional cost to me as prices are the same to me regardless of how i pay.  Cash or credit.

my degree is in business.  It's focus was economics.  Economic theory is sound, its based on math.  Math is not disputable.  How you apply economic theory is disputable, however, blockchain and crypto currency are too new and too limited to even pretend to have predictive models.  Everything going on right now is speculation of a new technology that could become enormous, or could fail completely.  Anyone suggesting they know one way or the other for sure is a liar.
This post was about BTC replacing credit cards because CCs charge fees and that would never happen with BTC.  But BTC is fee based.  You either have to pay to mine it, pay to buy it, or when it actually becomes a viable large scale currency you will have to pay to use it in scenarios like BTC based credit, pay to use it.  The whole point of starting a credit based business is to make money on fees and interest.  Nobody will do it without it, so this entire post is garbage.
Similarly most of the bullish nonsense posted on is nonsense and misinformation contributed by "hodlers" trying to drive up the price so they can make short term gains.  That's fine, that is how economics and propaganda work, but that doesnt make it any less bullshit.  I'm a hodler.  I hold BTC, ETH and LTC in not insignificant amounts, but im speculating.  That's reality.

You whats far more likely than this?  One nation sewing discord in the crypto community. Manipulating the sec and other regulatory agencies. Keeping the price of btc artificially low and buying it in bulk over time. Eventually this horded bitcoin will cause prices to rise and demand is more difficult to meet due to the deflationary nature of btc. 
They continue to buy through the early price rise pushing the price up even further. As people note the rally the hostile country stops buying letting the bulls apply the pressure.  Once the hostile actor is confident that the rush is at its end they dump their horded btc onto the market making windfall profits and crashing the market. 
The hostile actor now has crippled the crypto economy all the while crushing the economies of other nations who have put any reserves into crypto.

Let me put it to you this week genius. 51% of the world has access to the internet in what way do you think it would be possible for a form of currency that half of the world population does not even have access to to either spend or hold is somehow going to replace Fiat anytime soon. And I suggest you read actual economic text or articles instead of Bitcoin propaganda. I am not anti Bitcoin or anti crypto. I am however anti-propaganda because trying to inflate the value of something irrationally will only lead to a bubble and Bubbles only hurt the product. The number one most important thing about a reserve currency is its stability and the people's trust that any change in its value will be subtle and gradual over time. The attitude that is rented right now revolving around this Market and this technology is unhealthy for both. There is nothing wrong with being a bull but this smells more like bull shit
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:57:06
Because that country wouldnt be in control of currency. If the US wanted to crush bitcoin because it couldnt be controlled that is how they would do it and because its deflationary there is no hedge against it  
My opinion is not stupid. Its a totally viable scenario. And its not just the us that could do it. China could do it as well.  So could opec if they fear that their petroleum base for their economy is nearing a collapse due to falling demand in the near future.  The eu could afford to but probably wouldnt.  Russia could not afford it. 
Bitcoin can be manipulated easily by any group with sufficient funding that gets in early enough.   Dont forget that its speculated that 5% of all bitcoin is still hodled by its founder/s. 5% is enough to collapse an economy. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:11:49
Lol. But its not a reserve currency or anything close to that now. Its a volatile experiment that has a lot of promise. But all the propaganda you want to spout about "the most solid form of money ever created" is not going to make it so. 
Btc needs to come into its own organically which it has until recently. The insane run up to 20k was not a good thing for btc. It made a joke out of it. It made it a target for speculators who are looking to get rich quick and dump. All this talk of hodl is totally anti-economic theory. For btc to grow it has to be spent. For it to become the reserve currency of choice it needs to become ubiquitous. That wont happen over night. This year or this decade.   
The govts of the world have far too much to lose to just allow btc to take over and they do have the power to break currencies. 
Im not wrong. The scenario i out forth is a possible one.  Anyone with sufficient access to funds can buy, sell and short and make huge profits at the expense of others all dependent upon timing.

The us govt will mine and buy up tons of btc. The hoarded btc will cause the supply to dwindle and thereby driving up the price. The us will then short a ton of btc etfs and then dump all its btc on the market. Crashing the market and reaping massive profits from the short and its sale. 
Then they can decide if they want to rebuy at the new crashes rate if they believe btc can survive the crash. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 14:48:31
That might be true if the entire world economy didnt depend on the chinese and us economies. The US can run up debt forever as long as they continue to grow their economy at scale. The world has a vested interest in the health of the us economy. If it fails btc will have no value because the world economy will fail. You wont be able to buy anything with btc cause nobody will have anything.

Libertarians are not only about low taxes and guns, brother.  They want a strong military, but not to use it as the republicans do.  they are about freedom to do with their bodies as they please.  They are about freedom to make their own medical decisions. 
Republicans lower taxes, but increase the size of the government.  They increase debt, and support the Fed both of which are huge libertarian no-nos.  they engage in wars of aggression.  they spend HUGE amounts on health care, but dont provide it to everyone, even though it would be cheaper to do so.
 Here is a list of things that libertarians want that Republicans are staunchly against:
  
Abortion  
Net Neutrality  
No wars of aggression  
legalized drugs  
Freedom from surveillance  
Lowering taxes by lowering spending (republicans lower taxes and increase spending)  
  
  
Things liberatarians want that democrats are against:  
  
Low taxes (fewer govt services and regulations)  
Gun registration/Control (democrats do not want to, and cannot "take our guns")  
  
Which is worse?  
  
Republicans..obviously.  In every sense.  At least democrats hearts are in the right place even if they are fiscially  
 irresponsible.  At least they acknowledge that what they want to do will cost more and that taxes will need to go up.  Republicans just drop taxes to get re-elected and pass the debt on to the next generation.

Psychology uses the scientific method, but the results are always biased because people under observation always change their behavior. 
  
"Technology" is not a science. 
  
Economics is as much of a science as psychology in that it uses the scientific method and mathematics in its few testable aspects. But as it relies on psychology it has untestable hypotheses that rely on interpretation and qualitative instead of quantitative analysis. 
  
And before you say "it's a social science" social sciences and natural science are not the same thing as one delivers desirable reliable results and the other does not.

You should feel that way too. There is no data to suggest that crypto is a sustainable technology or that it will catch on as a currency or a store of value in the long run. The speed at which crypto is advancing ..there is no reason, other than blind hope, for you to believe that bitcoin will be around for another 5 years much less 2000 years.   There is also no data that says that bitcoin will be a store of value when the fiat economy goes down.   Crypto may very well have a future, but you have no data or any government policy research to base your decision on.

Impressive article that was clearly written by a member of this sub and makes the global economy and currency policy into a simple calculation of supply and demand.  
  
Economics is not a hard science.   Printing more money is not the only reason inflation exists.  You can and will still have recessions and depressions with any currency and being unable to manage the supply of currency can be both a good and bad thing.  With bitcoin a single, powerful and wealthy entity could, in theory, accumulate enough bitcoin to single handedly manipulate the entire market, it happens today even with bitcoin being just a value store.  Imagine what a dollar would be worth if there were only 21 million of them.  The difference between bitcoin and the dollar is that bitcoin on its face is only understood by a technical minority. People dont understand economics as a whole. But they do understand what money is, what it represents, and why it has value to them. Scarcity is only valuable if the item itself has value to many. Bitcoins value is totally manufactured.  Without the laws that govern countries to force  acceptance of currency, adoption is....difficult.  and good luck getting a country to force acceptance of a 3rd party currency that they cannot control.
@_date: 2019-12-26 03:10:52
It's a totally different kind of investment. Gold is a hedge against inflation and an economic downturn. Bitcoin is a high risk high reward investment.   Literally the opposite of gold.

@_date: 2019-12-28 16:27:47
They didnt ask what kind, how much, or where you purchased them. They are just asking a question. It doesnt even ask which you did. Purchase or sell.  Its just a question.  If you dont answer the question they cant penalize you. Just reject your return.  It's an informational question. 
  
The irs having information on how many people are transacting crypto hurts no one. In the future it can hurt no one.  If crypto is made illegal and you want to keep it you just out it in a hardware wallet and say you dont have it. They can do nothing about it.

If they decide that crypto is illegal un the US you will be able to sell it. They worn confiscate it  they will shut down the exchanges and make it illegal to accept it as payment. 
When the US made hoarding gold illegal they bought it all. They didn't just seize it unless you tried to hide it. More info is always worse, I agree.   But hiding the fact that you own crypto is tantamount to attempting to hide income or capital gains.

Its just a question. It's not obligation. They just want to know how many people are using crypto. they need to know how to manage their forms and how many resources to dedicate to monitoring of it. People have to fill out taxes. 
This is a form everyone has to fill out. They cant just toss it in the trash or slam the door in its face like the census. 
How could this info hurt you?
@_date: 2019-12-27 23:06:45
Confiscate means take without payment or restitution.   Not the same. 
It asks if you've ever bought any. Doesnt ask how much.  And there is no indication that you have to answer the question.  
Crypto currency is considered property. But as it is used to transact business it is also a currency.   That makes it a different ballgame. Currency is a vehicle to transfer wealth for goods and services which is what crypto and especially bitcoin claim to be the endgame. Not a store of value or investment. Just like fiat can be both currency and investment.  
  
This question asks nothing of type, quantity, location or anything else. It just asks if it's something that you do. A census based on revenue generation.  There is no reason to hide your affiliation with crypto, it's not illegal now. There are no current plans to make it so.   This is simply an indication that crypto is becoming an emerging factor that the revenue department is going to have to figure out how to manage.  Seeing as how property predates the US govt and the IRS that question was unnecessary since property in all it's forms was already ubiquitous.  This is a whole new form of uncontrolled and in theory uncontrollable revenue. It will be difficult to enforce taxation on the proceeds of these investments.   Getting basic information is hardly some encroachment of your privacy.  If they put you in some database and they come ask you sim simply say you bought some Aurora coin and then it went flat and you tossed your wallet. But we both know that's not going to happen. 
  
And what we really know is that anyone attempting to hide assets is sketchy. Period.

Every news outlet has misinformation. Whether intentional or not media is manipulated. It's up to the people to make up their own minds. 
Fake news is fox news. Where its deliberately false or in the best case misleading. There are other fake news outlets on both sides of the spectrum, but cnn isn't one. It's just a shitty news outlet like washington post or the NY post.

What state governor says that. The removal of guns at a state level is decided law. It cannot be enforced under the 2nd and 4th amendments of the federal constitution which supersedes any state or local law. 
  
And wtf do you think will happen with bitcoin if it becomes the new currency.   You think there will be no more banks? Be no more fed?  You can control the amount of bitcoin the same way.   Especially since no individual or group can mine on the scale of the federal government. 
 
Any attempt to replace current fiat with bitcoin will be met with the elimination of bitcoin completely.

Other than fox news what is your favorite propaganda source?
@_date: 2019-01-07 16:07:32
history is 10,000 years.  Banks have existed in their current form for about 300.  So...this is not in any way correct.  Like just about all other propaganda on r/bitcoin

Recorded history. If we are talking about geologic time then his statement is even more inaccurate.  But thanks for being pedantic.

And everyone in r/bitcoin saying "omg bitcoin is so awesome because it cant be manipulated"  all the while it's being manipulated to keep prices low enough for investment but too high for regular people to get a lot.

Its funny. People keep using words lile crash and collapse. That's not what's happening. The economy is cyclical. Every bullish period is followed by bearish periods as the economy re establishes it's new baseline.  Because economics  and the economy itself are more than just math but have intricate psychological factors which play into the timing and speed of recovery.  
Recession is natural. Like the tide it has to go down after it comes up.  Permanently  Sustained growth is impossible.

There is a lot you dont understand about fiscal policy of central banks and regulated financial orgs like insurance companies, pensions, and regulated money lenders/banks. 
I started to type some of it out but then I remembered..the internet. 
Bitcoin may be the future. But its insanely volatile and will not be a haven or hedge against volatility until it's a proven asset. The reason gold is an asset against uncertainty us because gold has a known value and tangible use even outside its desirability as a precious metal.

its posts like this that make this sub so cringy.  Either this is propaganda and intentional which is bad..or worse its just plain stupidity that doesn't know the difference between the fed and the treasury.
You all understand that rapid deflation can be just as bad as inflation right?

It most certainly is not. Many humans crave it. But many humans would prefer to be rich and anonymous than rich and famous.

Yea. Let's hold people who lived 300 years ago to the standards of morality we have today. The entire south still had jim crow laws in the 1950s and yet strom Thurmond was a us senator into the 00s. 
But yea  let's hold ben Franklin to the standard of 2019 when he I basically started the movement that brought hs to where we are in the us.

Bitcoin is not stock. Its currency.
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:32:20
Fiat can use electricity or internet but does not require either. Big difference. You should google the word "need" for help.   
  
Bitcoin is great. everyone knows its revolutionary. But it's not better than stock for what stock is used for. Comparing bitcoin to stock is a non-starter.

All currencies are investments. You can trade currencies just like you trade stocks or bonds or commodities.
The fact that you don't understand that anything that carries value is and can be an investment means that you are the one who probably needs to hit the books and take some basic economic theory

You're missing the point of your own post. 
Currency never closes. It's always available, liquid, and transferable. Bitcoin is less so because it requires power and internet to be transferred where as fiat do not. 
Bitcoin has advantages and disadvantages just like any other instrument that holds value.  But being available at all times is not a benefit shared solely by bitcoin. It's not a unique property of bitcoin. Many markets are 24 hours and trading can be do e 24 hours, it just doesnt come to until markets open.
