This rather ignores the fact that if a bitcoin-only economy were ever to happen, then you'd need functioning exchanges for people to transfer their non-bitcoin wealth into bitcoin wealth.
I mean if humans ever achieve immortality, then we won't need hospitals, but they're kinda useful right now.

There's still underground house, man.  Some of the minimal stuff you get in random european nightclubs is anything but commercial.  It's a nice broad spectrum from that to the stuff that tops charts, which is kinda cool.

OSIRIS-REX's budget is the best part of a billion dollars, 2 bring back 2kg of material.  I'm all about long term investing, but i think the timescale might be a bit more than you imagine.
Much better invest in something that you know is only going to get scarcer, like oil!

My neck of the woods you can expect techno, trance, drum n bass, house or electro with fairly equal likelihood.  London's good like that.

Funny how many people in r/bitcoin hate the global economy without having any economics qualifications.
@_date: 2014-05-21 07:45:54
Are you describing wikipedia or r/bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:31:51
Yes, I'm referring to football, not american football.  football (soccer) came first, therefore it gets primacy of the name!
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:10:33
That's because the market is illiquid which is likely helping fuel the bubble.

I donated to them with my card the other day.  The process took me approximately 30 seconds.  If you're going to act the ass over having to spend 30 seconds donating to something as useful as wikipedia then, well, I doubt you were ever actually going to donate in the first place.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:31:18
As far as I can tell, at best they're missing out on a few hundred dollars from assholes who'd rather spend time on reddit slapping one another on the back for not donating to a charity, as opposed to taking all of about 1 minute to type their card details into an online form.

Rational, well thought out and not at all over-the-top in tone.  I like it!

When all the oil runs out there will be much, much more pressing things to use your precious solar energy on than mining bitcoin.

I don't think I ever said that manipulation wasn't manipulation, because that would be a fucking stupid thing to say.  I'm also not trying to sugar coat things, just state that it's not entirely cut and dried one way or the other.  Obviously what was going on was either shady or illegal, I don't know enough about finance law to say, and I think it's a bit fuzzy, and it is in no way desirable of course.
My point was that this is much more complex and subtle than than tabbai makes out (as is the whole world of finance), and a lot less shadowy-conspiracy-theory than you seem to think.
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:13:42
Yeah he never quite grasped perspective.  I can see why he was so annoyed.

As the reward for mining goes down the increase in transaction fees will long term trend upwards, mind.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:31:28
Yes.  Nobody thinks of it as currency yet.  Just as a way to get currency.  Early days.
Hell the high volume of sales linked to the price drop could be those same retailers selling and adding liquidity to the market.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:19:40
Transaction anonymity is possibly.  There's bitcoinfog, or the tumbler system that was used in the silkroad.

That's a delightful aphorism, but it's hardly applicable in this case.  Big banks and governments hire economists, yes, but there are plenty of academic economists out there who aren't tied to monolithic institutions.  You've got rather a blinkered view of a whole scientific discipline.
If anyone is going to have a decent grasp of what's going on with bitocoin at the moment, it'll probably be an economist.  After all, it's still just money (or, at the moment, a speculative commodity), and it's not exactly mindblowingly different enough from regular money that everything that we've learned about money (through economics) over the last few hundred years is suddenly not going to apply.

So by profit from I guess I didn't mean "make a fortune investing in".  It was more sort of, they are among the best people equipped to figure out the intricacies of the new monetary system, and as such this would be valuable to them.
And you're right about old/new scientists, as happened with lots of the old guard refusing to accept quantum mechanics, but I'm not certain yet that this represents such a fundamental paradigm shift.
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:31:06
Nah.  My analogy was pretty much spot on.  Long term predictions of chaotic systems nearly being impossible and that.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:10:26
So I assume you don't think meteorology is a valid science because it can't accurately predict the weather next year

It depends.  Sometimes the people who were manipulating LIBOR were trying to push it upwards.  This will have been rubbish for people who did loan swaps, but great if you're a big institution and have some of your money in an account whose interest rate is tied to LIBOR, but rubbish if you have a LIBOR tied mortgage.
Later, there were efforts to push LIBOR down.  This reverses people's fortunes.  Certainly, people whose mortgage rates were lowered during the LIBOR scandal aren't exactly going to be calling for bankers blood.
The fact it that many many markets are linked to LIBOR in different ways.  Some people win if it moves one way, other people win if it moves another way.  The people who were manipulating were in no way sufficiently Machiavellian to be trying to screw out the city of baltimore, or increase some guy's mortgage arrears or whatever.
I expect that as more time goes by the people who won will keep quiet and the people who lost will start utterly humongous lawsuits.
It's really not as simple as "oh libor was moved about the whole system is rigged CORPORATE PLUTOCRACY IS PICKING OUR POCKETS" or whatever.

Oh look ad hominem.  Since when is pointing out a flaw with something being 'anti' it?  Honestly.  The block chain is presently growing  exponentially.  This is a genuine issue.  It could easily be a petabyte inside a decade.  
I've used bit coin a few times, actually, I think it's an interesting idea, but with executional flaws.  I also think it's presently in a massive bubble and I'm not putting my money anywhere near it.  That's not anti bitcoin, it's just being prudent.

@_date: 2013-04-26 11:21:42
I knew just from the title that this was a Tabbai article.  The guys on r/finance would have a field day, I'm sure.  I like how he never mentions that libor rigging could just have easily gained towns, cities and other funds money.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:37:09
Erm, how precisely is bitcoin any less of a "pretend economy" than some of the more esoteric derivatives one can buy on various bond markets.

@_date: 2013-12-03 19:16:15
You're absolutely sure of this?  There are some people out there with a lot of coin who potentially could try.  Hell, the current price is probably driven by speculation, not spending.

I wonder if all the people saying "their loss" are aware of what colossal dicks they sound.  It's still not exactly difficult to donate to wikipedia, and since they provide an incredibly useful service for free, why not suck up the fucking 30 seconds it'll take you to type in a few details and give them some money (not that you would, since we all know you're just posturing).
Would you say the same to, say, the Philippines storm charity fund-raisers if they didn't accept BTC? 
@_date: 2013-04-26 16:50:10
I always think that with Tabbai the important thing to remember is that he's really writing more to entertain/outrage than to inform.  Which, obviously, is why he writes for rolling stone.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:27:22
I'd say that we're around enthusiasm right now, though it kind of depends where you draw the starting point of the graph.

I'm absolutely going to gamble a bit once this bubble bursts, but I'm not deluded enough to think I'm doing anything but speculating.
@_date: 2013-04-26 15:50:24
A shill for the finance industry?  I wish, I know a few and I'd get paid a fucking lot better if I were one.
The problem with Tabbai is that he's a polemicist, blowing everything so wildly out of proportion as to almost make it farcial.  I don't doubt that there are grains of truth in the stuff he writes about, but he uses them to build such monstrous edifices that it's really hard to take his conclusions in any way seriously.  I certainly don't trust him to do actual, impartial financial journalism.

There are 2 possible answers to this question.
1)  The old grey men who study money with outdated ideas and principles just can't handle the fact that they're soon going to be history, and that a new paradigm of digital cryptocurrency is going to kick them into touch.  Their ideas are going to be shown to be flawed and they can't handle the truth, man!
2)  A number of rational and intelligent people who have spent a lot of time learning about and studying various aspects of wealth, trade and monetary systems have a number of very serious misgiving about what is still a new and highly untested technology, and are advising caution because there is significant potential for a lot of people to lose a lot of money in what appears to be a slightly bonkers thought-experiment that's happening in the real world.
And, in all serious, to all the people saying "omg the economists hate this because this runs so contrary to their beliefs lol".  Get a fucking grip.  Economists are going to be loving this.  This is going to be like Christmas to them.  They'll be writing books and research papers about bitcoin for years to come, no matter what happens.  This is new, exciting data for them.  Why do you think so many articles on r/economics are about bitcoin in the first place.  And if, by some miracle, bitcoin ends up succeeding, they they'll be just fine with that, because thanks to their skillset they're the people who will be best placed to analyse, understand and profit from any new monetary paradigm that we might enter.
