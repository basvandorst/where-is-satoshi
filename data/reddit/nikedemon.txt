What do you mean by "computer power"?
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:34:11
Could you please explain what mining power means? And just to clarify...when I say creator I mean like the inventor of the Bitcoin code. Not the person who bought it.

Interesting. do you think Bitcoin will ever fully replace physical currency in the future?

ELI5: what the hell determines the value of Bitcoins? And what's stopping the creator of the code or hackers to go in and  up the value as they see fit?

Another question...what is preventing market manipulation? 
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:11:29
Same here, which is why I asked. Hopefully I’m better (and wealthier) at the game of life than I was at Oregon Trail.

The further and further it goes down, the more tempted people will be to buy, especially below 10k.

Ledger it is then.
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:37:16
That’s what I keep telling myself.

My understanding is the computers compete with one another to solve a complex cryptography math problem. Whichever one solves them first verifies the transaction. How the transactions are divided up between those computers is unknown to me.  But I’m guessing it has to do how many available nodes there are at any given moment.

Wow, thanks for the clarification! I was *way* off.

Binance seems to have the most volume. What’s your exchange of choice?

What’s your opinion on just buying straight up rural land in the US just to HODL?
@_date: 2019-12-20 00:54:21
Probably Binance, Binance, and...Binance.
@_date: 2019-09-28 08:39:21
Thanks for clarifying. My bad, I heard he sold it all.

I always thought it was super sketchy that Vitalik sold ALL his ETH when BTC hit 19k. That’s like a CEO selling all company stock but remaining CEO. Why would anyone buy it if the fucking creator doesn’t own any? I’m sure he’s bought some back, but still...

Definitely. It is way more regulated than it was in 2017 which gives credibility and most of the exchanges now have insurance to safeguard against theft. I’d say adoption is coming along nicely, albeit kinda slow. Can’t rush progress tho.  After we hit 100k everyone with a computer and electricity access will want a piece, especially Wall Street.
