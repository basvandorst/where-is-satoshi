Being the public relations sockpuppet of Mircea Popescu, it is to be expected. That guy is an insane asshole and not much else.

The Streisand Effect, no?

This solution is simply not feasible. The bitcoin protocol itself has no notion of a 'pool'. Even if you did implement something like this, people would simply (again, acting in their own economic interest) split the pool up to avoid the difficulty hike but still keep it de-facto as a single pool.

Trisquel is a distro with a strong focus on software freedom. If I had to trust any of them with pre-installing my wallet software, it'd be either them or Parabola. Shipping malicious software goes against their entire philosophy and would make them use their entire userbase instantly.

Now, as a consequence, most of the comment section is made up out of nearly identical instances of people briefly describing what happens in the video for people reading their G+ site instead of comments that were made for people have already seen the video and discuss its contents and/or add to it.

A well organized conspiracy of all miners could do much worse stuff which much less effort, though.

Oh, I'm supposed to give internet stranger A control over my computer because internet stranger B says he's totally a legit guy?
Sure, buddy. How about I spare you some work and just hand over my wallet keys right away?
And the excuse about hot patching bugs is complete bullshit. There is no possible bug that could make this script worse than it already is, as it executes random code from just about anybody.

The paranoia is *definitely* not unwarranted.
I had to learn this the hard way when I lost 2btc to a keylogger attack. Now I do everything on a machine with no network interface.

Tor is not only about censorship resistance, though. It is primarily an anonymity network. Therefore, I think something like Zcash could more adequately described as "the Tor of Money".

A friend just called me and woke me up to tell me about the price drop, now I just want to go back to sleep, having bought at $130.

Why is this a misconception? No offence, I honestly want to know.

I must have had the keylogger on my PC before but I really have no idea. One day I simply saw a transaction  away from my wallet to a random address.

If you think this post is insane, check out some other stuff from his blog. He has rape justification, victim-blaming and just all around sexism.
Oh and he expects people to pay if they want to view more than five pages of this crap.

A lot of vendors are not accepting trades right now or are claiming to be out of stock. But it's still up and people are still trading.

Well, how do you hold dollars (or whatever your fiat currency is) without gambling them away? Why can you not apply that to BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:12:15
Peercoin has a nice solution for this:
There is inflation fixed at 1%, so if the market grows too stale it will automatically gain velocity. On the other side, a small portion of each transaction gets discarded, so if the market grows too volatile, it will automatically gain holding power, because the currency becomes more and more valuable.

It's already happening to some extent, mainly because the sdice gamblers are spamming the miners with transactions so you have to pay at least a little fee if you want to get into the next block.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:43:16
You can also trade bitcoin for either dollars or gold, just not from a government.
