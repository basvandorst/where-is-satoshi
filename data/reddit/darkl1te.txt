I might be misunderstanding something here - why would they want to keep the company solvent? Nobody's going to use their company's services this has happened, and they've got no financial liabilities to the people whose BTC they lost since legally it's not a currency. Isn't it easiest for them to just go 'welp, we lost all your bitcoins, sorry' and exit stage right with a truckload of money?

And if you didn't buy the hat off them and made it yourself or traded elsewhere for it? If you mined these bitcoins yourself and put them in a Gox wallet, and then they lose them, how is your legal standing different from someone whose virtual item drop was lost due to a server error?


Where is that exactly? Wikipedia says Germany, Finland, and East Texas - is there anywhere else?

I'm curious - what can they be accused of?

No, it's very relevant. Consider virtual goods such as items or currency in a video game: if the developers were to screw up and lose all their customers' items, would there be an 'investigation' or 'criminal proceedings' or fraud charges? I doubt it.
When it comes down to the legal implications of this, I think *very much* matters whether Bitcoin is a virtual good that people assign monetary value to (like hats in Team Fortress 2) or whether it's a currency.

You mean like when Gox 'lost' 750,000 BTC?

Criminal proceedings? What would they be charged with (genuine question here)? Bitcoin isn't legally a currency and there are no laws regulating it...

The analogy I've got stuck in my head is that this is like the developers of an MMO stealing some users' virtual in-game currency, and that consequently legal action over this would be somewhat difficult and ineffectual. 
I have a feeling it's a horribly wrong analogy though - I'd be grateful if you could correct it.

Because you can't. It doesn't matter if they relaunch MtGox as Gox, people aren't going to use it and any further potential for theft is a tiny fraction of the original. If they want to do this again, they'd have to put together a new site under a different name and slowly build up trust.


That's not 'oversimplified', that's flat out wrong. The FDIC is funded by [premiums paid by banks]( and uses that to cover losses, not a money printer. 


How is it an advantage that all the people involved lose their money but know not to make the same mistake again, when a central insurance body would result in a) nobody losing money and b) people learning not to make that mistake relatively painlessly?
clarification edit: the last paragraph refers purely to what I see as an advantage of having a central insurance body - I'd be grateful if you could consider that in isolation rather than associating it with all the associated baggage like banks hiding their failures, since that's not what I'm advocating for obvious reasons

I'd be impressed if you had but managed to post to Reddit anyway.
