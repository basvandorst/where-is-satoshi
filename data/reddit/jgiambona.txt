Get a hardware wallet to receive the bitcoins (and properly secure the mnemonic phrase). Then use a OTC provider to liquidate it. Tough to insulate from currency risk, which is a concern even between fiat currencies.

As is commonly suggested, blockchain is akin to the PC or the Internet at the time.  The entire industry has tremendous potential.  It remains to be seen whether cryptocurrency can ever take the place of fiat (I for one think it can).

Congratulations! It must be a great feeling.  Are you all in on btc or diversified into other crypto?

Thank you for encouraging everyone to be objective and well-informed.  It's too easy to get stuck in an echo chamber..

I’d like to hear more opinions on this possibility, as I haven’t had the time to properly research it myself.  Seems plausible to me though.

It is both a long term AND high risk investment.  But if you understand the technology and economics behind it, it’s worthy of a significant portion of your portfolio imho.. but always diversify asset classes (stocks, bonds, crypto, etc.), as well as within asset classes (don’t be all in on bitcoin for example, diversify to other crypto).

How was your money stolen? How was your account locked down?
