Flysiesta is also accepting BTC. Prices are similar to Skyscanner. Airbaltic (Latvian state owned air company) also accepting BTC.

"The Russian parliament the Duma has said cryptocurrency “is becoming objective reality” following its legalization earlier this month." - cryptocurrencies are not legalised in Russia. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 19:32:52
~~Agree. No "private blockchain" was mentioned as well. Also -"Blockchain's low processing speed was seen as a major drawback of the technology" - probably refers to bitcoin chain.~~
Ok, wrong.   
@_date: 2016-12-21 13:49:39
As long as you don't have official legal status (law, rules, etc.) of something in Russia - it's illegal. You're probably not familiar with reality in this part of the world. 
Having NO STATUS = being illegal.

It's a news aggregator - its main purpose to re-post content from other websites. They take Bitcoin/blockchain related news from different sources, extract important information so you don't need to spend time on going trough all article. They are upvoted because they usually post interesting news. Retargeting for what? 
@_date: 2016-12-21 13:52:06
Bitcoin is very popular in here, we all know that. But this fact doesn't correlate with "legal/illegal".

Just read "About" &amp; "The Hodl Index" sections. In terms of "subjective" - they will probably fix this issue in version 0.3 as mentioned in this post.

Yeah, another ICO.

1. Charge backs. A. Use payment methods with no charge backs or when it's not easy to reverse payment. B. Always check the reputation and rating of your counterparty C. If you trade with new counterparty - don't risk too much.  
Also you can give fake ID instead of your own and this won't prevent you to reverse payment. 
2. If you use banking system you already dealing with someone who most probably using proceeds from criminal activities. This "someone" is bank. Welcome to real world!

Why do you think that Hodl Hodl does respond to requests slower than LBC? We have even smaller time frames in some cases (e.g. during disputes). Also, our multisig system allows us to move coins in one or another direction (2 out of 3 - one key to seller, another to buyer and third key goes to Hodl Hodl), so, no, bitcoins won't be locked forever in multisig or for a longer time period. KYC might help you solve disputes faster (sometimes), but I doubt that this is a reason to imply it on every user. KYC is done by these platforms for regulators, yet they tend to say it's for your own good - because this sounds better.
@_date: 2017-04-24 18:25:14
No, you will receive notification if someone created a contract with you (accepted your offer to sell/buy BTC). In the same manner your counterparty will receive notification when you send fiat or deposit/release BTC.
@_date: 2017-04-25 05:53:29
Hodl Hodl is not acting as an escrow, instead they create a multisig escrow on Bitcoin's Blockchain for every trade. They don't own it and they can't move BTC from it without second signature (which is owned by BTC seller). 
In practice, you don't have to withdraw anything from Hodl Hodl because all trades happening from/to your BTC wallet directly with your counterparty.

Sorry, but once again - I don't see any QUESTION asked in both of your above given examples. So which questions were unanswered? 
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:29:57
There was not a single question mark in  the original comment. Not a single one. First you accuse people of not answering "uncomfortable" questions, then you actually ask them post-factum. Good job.
@_date: 2017-04-28 22:28:03
sorry, but which uncomfortable question wasn't answered in this thread?
@_date: 2017-04-30 18:32:23
What an idiot

just checked - works fine for me. I create new offer from my personal account and click on Save and Preview. Nothing gets published, just preview.

Because you don't negotiate with terrorists. And some miners (not all of them!!!) are acting like ones. As an ordinary hodler I'm really tired of irresponsible actions of these people (Jihan, Ver, Wang, etc.) - one day they say one thing, another day they say another. And I'm really feeling like a hostage at the moment. So we should decrease their impact on Bitcoin (better remove them at all).

Actually Hodl Hodl is 0% trading fee atm (up until July 2018). Doubt that you can make it lower)
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:11:50
LocalBitcoins - 1% fee. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:46:40
Although not launched yet, but Hodl Hodl (testnet.hodlhodl.com, hodlhodl.com) won't support 2X as well 
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:57:01
Will see. My point is that you should compare Hodl Hodl with LB or Paxful in terms of trading fees.

Would suggest star rating for each "flagged" news (similar to Morningstar investment ratings). 
For example, opening few Bitcoin ATMs in US - 1 or 2 star positive news. Officially allowing BTC trades in Russia - 5 star positive news. The same approach goes to negative news.
