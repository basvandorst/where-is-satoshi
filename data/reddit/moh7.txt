Transaction fees don't affect me, the consumer and 99.9% of people don't care about what a business has to pay to use a visa. So no I don't really care. 


I said that it would be good for that. In 3 different posts. That and porn, bitcoin will thrive in the online porn industry because people don't like "BIGFATBLACKBOOTY.com" coming up on their statements. 


No because I'm not a libertarian and I actually like when the government intervenes sometimes... MtGox would have never robbed/fucked up so many people if there was some type of regulation or government body overlooking the MtGox books. Also refunds are a problem with bitcoin, let's say I buy something online with bitcoins and I never receive the item. There is no chargeback. Credit cards have chargebacks and I can get my money back. 


Yes to you. But most people simply do not give a fuck about any of these.

By me I mean the average joe. 
Why should Betty sue the barista use bitcoin instead of a credit card?
If bitcoin is such a revolutionary thing then this answer should be easy? 


That's not how they make most of their money, but if they start to lose money because bitcoin is doing a better job then we all know the banks are smart enough to do something about it.

This again?
It's called plausible deniability which is how the banks are able to stay out of prison
The bitcoiners that got himself arrested essentially admitted to all his crimes in a few email exchanges. He fucked himself over quick and hid no evidence.
The banks did a better job at keeping themselves safe and we live in a country where you aren't going to jail unless there's enough proof to put you in there. 
Stop stroking each other's cocks please, the floors already sticky.

@_date: 2014-02-03 21:01:38
What a nice circlejerk we have going on here. Everyone please take a moment to take the cocks out of your mouths to listen to the actual reasons. 
1. The bitcoiner involved fucked himself over with a few emails and will easily be found guilty because he left a trace behind and essentially admitted to doing it all in the emails. 
2. The banks were smarter and hid behind many loopholes and strong lawyers who are able to prove "plausible deniability". IE they are able to hide their crimes better then you and since we live in an "innocent until proven guilty" world we can't charge them until we have enough proof.

What silly silly people you bitcoiners are. 
The chances of me being burnt by buying bitcoins is 10x greater then me being burnt by buying something from a known reputable site like Wikipedia, newegg etc. 
You're entire argument boils down to a silly "what if". I can do what ifs too and those what it's have a higher chance of happening to bitcoin then my credit card

@_date: 2014-02-18 16:32:05
No it's not a fair reflection. Have you ever heard of what pump and dumps are? Because they happen every month with bitcoin. 
What you're essentially saying is that all those penny stocks that can go up by 70% in a single day are fair reflections of price. 
It's not. Stop being silly. I refuse to believe that half the people here truly believe that as of right now bitcoins are worth anywhere near 600$. You must have a gut feeling knowing that it can't be true. 
God damn, just another day on r/bitcoin. Someone saying that market manipulation is fair pricing. Bitcoin is great because it's going to teach thousands of you economics. 
In the investing world it's called "paying tuition". You first start investing, you find a good stock you really like and you start to put money into it. You see the price rising so you think "holy shit I can make a lot of money off this" so you buy more and more and more. You truly think that this stock is going to be the next big thing because you've convinced yourself that there's nothing wrong with it and it's in good hands. Then a few days later the stock collapses and you've lost thousands of dollars. 
A lot of you are going to be paying tuition because so many of you really do believe that there's nothing wrong with bitcoins. I'll be investing in bitcoin 2.0, not this monthly pump and dump. Best of luck to you all and I truly feel bad for how delusional people on this subreddit have become.

One is insured while the other is not. 
That means that everyone who had money in that bank is probably getting it back. 
Meanwhile anyone who lost money in MtGox has lost it all. Companies lose money all the time. This isn't something new. They aren't going into bankruptcy, if they were then the stock price would have gone much lower then 5%. 
Stop trying to compare a bank not making enough money to MtGox literally losing their money and not being able to find it anymore.

Really? You're calling Bitcoin perfect? 
Yes there has been issues that have been argued a lot. But THATS WHAT THIS SUBREDDIT IS FOR. To talk about bitcoin. 
And the entire point is that there are people here that are so afraid of their investments losing money that they'll downvote anyone that questions bitcoin. 
There are people here that are blinded by greed and the promise of money. 
And no some questions haven't been answered. Bitcoin still has a MASSIVE confirmation time problem that might be it's demise. Imagine buying something and having to wait 7 minutes for a single confirmation. This doesn't work in real life. It's a massive flaw in bitcoin and until it is solved bitcoin is going to be hard to use in typical Brick &amp; mortar stores. 
Credit cards are also 100x easier to use then bitcoin to the point where the average American has NO use for bitcoin. 
Answer me this. I'm an American going to McDonald's, why should I use bitcoin over my credit card? And your answer better be about how bitcoin is better and not about how banks are bad. 
Go ahead if you truly believe that bitcoin is perfect.

@_date: 2014-02-18 17:14:27
Yup I did factor that in and I still agree with my 10$ mark. 
The mighty god gave Newell once said "it's a service problem" and I completely agree with him and you can apply it to bitcoin. 
How hard is it for me right now to buy bitcoins? I tried signing up with an exchange and it would have taken 3+ weeks or I can meet someone out on the streets and do shady exchanges.  
Bitcoin still has a massive service problem hence why I don't even think it's worth 100$ and why I believe it's being pumped by speculators and gamblers. It's still not easy for me to use it. 
I do think bitcoin has a future in porn payments and international money transfers though. But I strongly believe that bitcoin 2.0 will show up and over take those two rendering bitcoin pretty useless. 
I'm in a rush so sorry if a few of my sentences aren't making sense

The fact that bitcoins price can rise and fall by hundreds of dollars a day based on nothing IS NOT A GOOD THING. How do you people that walk around claiming this shit is good not realize that. 
It doesn't matter if it's in it's early stages. A 1000% rise based on nothing but hype is never a good thing. 
A 50% price drop in a few weeks is never a good thing. You people decide to purposefully ignore common sense and economics just to justify how great bitcoin is.

Bitcoin will never become mainstream and replace credit/checking because of confirmation times. 
Credit card transactions take seconds. Granted so do bitcoin transactions but the time to get 1 confirmation is over 10 minutes. 
I believe this opens up the door to acquire free goods from shops unless the customer is forced to wait for atleast one confirmation. 
Just like steam and pirating I believe bitcoins biggest fault will be convenience and bitcoin will never "make it" until it becomes more convenient then what we have. 
Thoughts? 
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:22:29

No they won't be fine with it. 
The mentality that shop owners will just have to be okay with thefts happening at their stores is insane. 
A typical coffee shop will rather pay the 5cents for a dollar coffee then risk people stealing from their shops. 
Business owners will just say no to bitcoin instead. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 05:45:05
It is a problem with bitcoin because it's still not easy to acquire  
Aslong as banks make sure credit cards are easier to use bitcoin will never be successful. It will be a tiny underground Internet currency. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:45:43
And you think that a price can rise and fall hundreds of %'s in a year is a good thing? 
See call me old fashion but I kinda like it when 1$ will buy me 1 candy bar today and tomorrow. Not when there's a chance 1$ buys me no candy tomorrow. 
Or when I get paid 500$ and it's worth 500$ today and tomorrow... Not 400 tomorrow. 
It definitely hasn't out performed every other currency and if you honestly think it did then you need to take some economics courses. 
It's not out performance when speculators and gamblers are inflating the price and dumping it every month. Performance of a currency is also based on stability. The fact that bitcoins price can rise and fall up to 20% per day simply proves that it's not performing well. Performance would mt GOX shuts down and the price only goes down by 2%. And that's being generous. 
But you'll ignore everything I say because such it the mentality on r/bitcoin. Bitcoin can do no wrong and instability and lack of confidence mixed with pump and dump definitely makes bitcoin a great performer 
@_date: 2014-01-21 14:40:49
It doesn't matter, the comment above yous point still stands. 
You on r/bitcoin may think that it's becoming huge and everyone knows about it but you're just suffering from the circlejerk effect
The reality is most people don't care about bitcoin and don't see the point of it because credit cards are less hassle to use.

@_date: 2014-02-18 16:17:38
Based on nothing but hype.....
That's not exactly a good thing and I hope people here realize that. 
It's not like the infrastructure and faith in bitcoin grew to the point where people think it's worth a thousand bucks, the fact that it can drop by hundreds of dollars upon bad news simply proves that the confidence in bitcoin is extremely low. 
The price is inflated because of hype and speculators that are making the price soar well past what it should be.

Either way some of those points are very good. Give me one good fucking reason I would want to put up with the hassle of using bitcoin and why I would want to carry 2 currencies around. There's no point of it and people here really don't realize how not needed bitcoin is when you get right down to it. Bitcoin is fantastic for international transfers and maybe porn.

No it doesn't. You're telling me that bitcoins innovated so much since 2013 that it deserved a 5000% price hike? You're fooling no one but yourself. Bitcoin still to this day has almost no uses and doesn't beat out using credit cards and you're telling me it's worth a 1000$? Believe what you want.

If it was an innovation then it would provide an advantage over using a debit card to buy the taco. 
Bitcoin really hasn't innovated anything. It's made international transfers cheap and that's it but if banks started losing money to bitcoin then all they would have to do is reduce their prices to match bitcoin. At that point bitcoin will provide 0 advantages to what we already have. 
Most people simply do not care about a decentralized money supply. The amount of fucks given is near 0 and it only pulls in anarchist/libertarian types.

See here's the problem with libertarians and this subreddit. You people honestly don't care about bitcoin. You just want to use it to fulfill your political garbage. You don't even care about it succeeding. Deep down you know you just want it to stick it to the man. 
And sorry but your not thinking critically. When you comment with something like "look at how evil the dollar is, it's used to bad that's why bitcoin is so good" then your proving that you aren't being logical. 
HAVE AN OPINION BUT DONT LET YOUR OPINION HAVE YOU. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:52:25
See here's your problem. You want bitcoin to succeed because you think it will change the way the world works. You want a revolution. You don't give a flying fuck about bitcoin and
It's potential as a cryptocurrency. You want to stick it to the man. 
You have to realize that it's never going to happen. The government will never let you evade taxes with bitcoin. You're looking at bitcoin in a very wrong way and you'll be very disappointed by what reality will do it. 
It's time to snap out of the libertarian thinking. Bitcoin is not a weapon of your revolution and using it as that will guarantee it demise. Keep in mind that the only way bitcoin will see true success is mass adoption by legal businesses. Being an underground currency will not help it. If a country bans bitcoin then you can be sure all those legal businesses will stop using it. It will be it's doom. 
So learn to accept it now. Bitcoin is not your weapon and it will be taxed.

That's good when a currency can lose 90% of it's value in a few months. 
Let's look at it in terms of living a bitcoin only life. 
You work 80 hours for a salary of 1000$ bi-weekly. 
At the end of the week you have 2000$ saved up for life needs. 
Bitcoins price has gone down 90%. You now only have 200$ to pay for rent and everything else. You're essentially fucked.

Anything over a 5% change in a currency is too much. What does bitcoin average at? there was a few days where it was over 20%. Imagine waking up in a world of bitcoin and you lost 20% of your money over night. That would wreck your finances and life.

 it's true it is a mirage, think about it. Bitcoin provides 0 advantages to using a bank if you're living in a first world country. There's just no reason to carry 2 currencies around. 
The "average joe" has no reasons to use bitcoin at all. 
And before people bring up bank fees because people here are extremely predictable. Get a better bank, I pay 0 fees to my bank and only have a couple of times due to my mistake. Aslong as your money's with a decent bank bitcoin provides NO ADVANTAGES.

1. Get a better bank. My bank actually doesn't charge me anything and they infact give me money every month. I pay 0 to store all my money and I know that it won't disappear tomorrow like MtGox. 
2. Yes I said it's great for international transfers. 
3. Not always a bad thing. Especially when it comes to possible illegal activity. I kinda like that I can also get my money back when I ask for it back (chargeback on a product). 
4. How is that a good thing? What would the average citizen of a developed country want to buy that's restricted in this manner? Either way those products would most likely already be restricted in most countries so this doesn't effect me. 
5. That's great actually, but still this really doesn't affect the typical person. It's affects business owners and how they receive money is going to be one of the smallest hassles compared to everything else that's needed to start a business. 
6. Fantastic, iv said it's a positive part of bitcoin over and over again. 
7. That's right they'll be using real money. Which by the way bitcoin will still be texted so your still funding those wars in the end. And either way this isint something anyone cares about. You just care as a libertarian. Normal people don't care. 
8. Ah great, tax evasion. That will truly make governments happy with bitcoin. 
Nope I don't see any real benefits. As an investor I know what it's like to convince myself that x stock is very important and will hit big. But it's not till it's gone bankrupt that I realize how useless it actually was and unfortunately a lot of people here will learn that soon. Other then international transfers no one has provided a single good reason for me to use bitcoin. 
And its not just me. It's everyone in the developed world. You can prove me wrong when bitcoin becomes something other then an easy market manipulation tool. Do you sheep really believe that the price rising yesterday was just optimism? 
I honestly feel bad for a lot of people here, iv lost a lot of money before too as an investor and it's why I stay away from penny stocks and bitcoin is worse then that. You're all part of a massive money making scheme for a select few. Wonder what that's called.

That's not really a good chart........
Especially when most bitcoin transactions are trades. 
The truth is we'l never actually know how much people are buying with bitcoin because it's lost in a transaction graph that only shows total transactions. 
All that graph is saying that traders are active on the market, and with transactions fees of near 0 it's very easy for a single person to make hundreds of transactions a day. Doesn't mean they're spending their coins at all. Just means they're trading. 
Also there's bots going around Chinese bitcoin markets significantly inflating # of transactions.

With my credit card I regularly use pay pass which takes me 2-5 seconds to purchase something. All I literally have to do is tap my CC to a receiver and I'm out of there. 
The truth is anything over a minute in this day in age is way too long. Nobody wants to wait around that long after purchasing something.

You need to snap back to reality. The world isint sunshine and rainbows. 
There is a MASSIVE difference between shoplifting and stealing with 0 confirmation. 
With 0 confirmations you can look like an honest person that just bought something then walk out and before the store even realizes that you dint actually have the money you're long gone. 
You can stop shoplifters, you can't stop anyone who does the trick shown in this thread. 
If you're realistic and you're not just blinded by bitcoins greed then you'll stop living in such a neive world. 


BULLLLLLSHIT. You need to go outside more. It's obvious you aren't being realistic. 
Pick your poison. B&amp;M shops can no longer accept bitcoin or they are forced to make customers wait up to 8 mins for a confirmation. 
There is no "I trust everyone around me". This is the real world. Not a hippie convention.

The problem is not wether or not it has happened. 
The problem is wether or not it CAN happen. 
This is a huge fault in bitcoin that essentially makes bitcoin near impossible to use in B&amp;amp;M stores. 
It's fine if bitcoin was safe with 0 confirmations but now we know it's not. Atleast 1 confirmation Is required and average confirmation times are currently around 6-8 minutes. 
No one is waiting even 5 minutes after purchasing a coffee just to make sure their payment went through.

You do realize that all this new innovative technology already exists right? 
Last week I was on a work trip and I rented a car where they dint give me a key but just a remote. The car had no slot to insert your key. You just just in your car and it would detect your remote and you pressed the start button. 
We already have cards at work to let us through doors, that's how most large office buildings work. 
And at the end of the day, it's just your imagination on what can happen and what we can do with bitcoin. If we actually could do it then lets see people start creating technologies to sell or use. Oh right that hasn't been happening. 
Either way my entire point was that bitcoin revolutionizes nothing when it comes to money/currency and that's what 99.9% of people here think it's for. 
So I'll ask again, in terms if money and currency what does bitcoin revolutionize?

Personally I did a lot of research on bitcoin when it first came out and decided that I don't think it has potential to survive in a first world country. 
I also think that a lot of people here try to spout a lot of bs about how bitcoin is perfect and how there's nothing wrong with it. 
I honestly stick around here because this community loves to trick people into buying bitcoin for their own selfish motives of doing everything they can to drive the price up. 
This is causing gullible people to put money into bitcoin without doing the proper research and as an investor in real money myself that sickens me. 
R/bitcoin was pushing people to buy at 1200 because "to the moon" "the price will keep rising" etc etc. 
It's getting way to selfish here and if me and others aren't here to talk about the negatives of bitcoin then who will?

Then re read his comment because he dismisses any negatives about bitcoin as myths or says that all questions have been answered. 
Actually I use my credit card for tiny purchases all the time, it's quicker and I don't have to carry/break change. Thanks to tap pass it's takes 3 seconds to make a purchase with a credit card. 


But why would a deli give you that discount? Because it's bitcoin and you don't have to pay credit card processing fees right? Nope. That's silly thinking. 
First of all if credit card fees were so bad then stores would currently offer discounts for using cash instead of credit cards. 
Secondly people here - ESPECIALLY on this sub severely over inflate how much credit card processing fees actually are. 
You and others here have to understand that businesses here are offering 10% off with bitcoin AS AN ADVERTISEMENT ATTEMPT. Not because bitcoin is taking 10% of their cost off. 
So let's say we live in a magical world 5 years later. Bitcoin is widespread and all the big stores support bitcoin. 
I walk into McDonald's and order a double Big Mac for my pig girlfriend. The price is 7.40$. What is my motivation for using bitcoin over my credit card.

Not really. I'm looking at it from a savings point of view. If I saved up 10 bitcoins for a 600$ rent and bitcoin tanks by 90% then iv lost the ability to pay that 600$ rent. 
I guess I shouldn't have said bitcoin only life style and I should have made it more clear.

@_date: 2014-02-18 16:55:10
Hmm id say as of right now since bitcoin is an unproven currency with confirmation time problems maybe a max of 10$. I don't see bitcoin becoming mainstream mainly because of the confirmation times. It's convenience that's key and until bitcoin proves that it's easier to use then tapping a credit card I don't see it becoming popular. 
I'm more interested in bitcoin 2.0. I see bitcoin as a trial run for cryptocurrencys as they do have a future. Just I feel that bitcoin won't be it. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:02:10
Please explain to me why anyone in the developed world would give a fuck about bitcoin then? Other then microtransactions, transferring money and porn. 
There's literally no reason for me to use bitcoin at my local mcdonalds and that's what why no one will care about it. there's no real incentive for anyone living in a developed country to use it.  
By the time these third world countries receive the infrastructure to support bitcoin banks and regular fiat will also be easier to use. 
Honestly people here have really delusioned themselves to how useful bitcoin actual is. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:18:28
No it's a factual statement. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:44:02
No they dint. Iv been investing for years. I'm speaking as someone who has thought about bitcoin a lot and when it comes right down to it I see no fucking point of using it over my CAD. 
And honestly the comparisons to already proven products that were actually very useful are getting lame and old. Stop comparing bitcoin to the automobile and compare it to something more realistic like beanie babies. 
Holy shit you people come up with awful arguments. What's funny is that for example you come up with of a product working (planes, automobiles etc) I can come up with a thousand others that actually did fail when people said they would. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:32:13
Unfortunately (or fortunately) this is an unregulated market and what they did can't be punished. 
It's funny how everyone complains about market manipulation when the price goes down but no one bitched about market manipulation when the price rose by 200$ after one person teased everyone with a high offer. 
Funny, almost hypocritical. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:58:26
Your comparing e-commerce, something that actually makes things a lot easier for people to bitcoin? Something that actually gives people MORE hassle and provides no real advantage that anyone cares about?
Horrid comparison and stop cherry picking successful ideas that already worked. For every successful idea you try to compare bitcoin to there 10,000 unsuccessful ideas I can compare it to. Be smarter about your comparisons, just because someone said "x ain't gonna work" 20 years ago and it ended up working it doesn't mean the same is going to happen with bitcoin. It's a SILLY argument sir. 


So are you, expect your view is emotional. Mine isint. I have nothing invested in bitcoin so I can look at it in a less biased way. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:38:48

You can't even compare google and Facebook to bitcoin. That's pure silliness. 
And no it doesn't have uses, give me one good reason why I should use bitcoin instead of a credit card? Just one good reason why when I'm at a restaurant and it comes time to pay I should pay with bitcoin and risk waiting for confirmation times or use my credit card and complete a transaction within 5 seconds by using paypass? 
Help me out here, I love cryptocurrencys but bitcoins not the future. Sorry

See iv talked to a lot of normal people who are knowledged on bitcoin at work. The overall conclusion we all agreed to was that bitcoin brings me 0 benefit over what I already have and if I wanted to use bitcoin it would just be an extra hassle that nobody would want to deal with because bitcoin doesn't give you an advantage or anything. 
Even if bitcoin became easy to use like credit/debit everyone is already comfortable and happy with what we have and there would be 0 point of going with bitcoin. 
Also confirmation times are atill a big problem. What exactly do bitcoin lovers plan to do about confirmation time? Imagine going to McDonald's for an egg mcmuffin. You buy with bitcoin and then your asked to wait in line until atleast one confirmation is received. Typical confirmation times are something like 20 minutes. 
Until confirmation times can be reduces to 2 seconds max I have no faith in bitcoin. With the tap technology we have now on credit/debit cards it literally takes me 2 seconds to buy anything. It's amazing. 
This revolution will not be televised because bitcoin will always be an online porn purchasing/international money transfer mechanic. Bitcoins confirmation time disallows it from surviving in the real world.

When will bitcoin be easier to use then my credit card? 
As we speak my credit card has tap pass. Which means I just tap my credit card on a receiver and the item is purchased in 2 seconds flat. 
Bitcoin is not as innovative as people are making it out to be. Until there is a simpler, quicker way then credit cards you will not see the masses transfer their funds to bitcoin. 
It's a service issue.

The other thing is when you looked to buy bitcoin through google mtgox was one of the first sites that came up.
With no regulation you could almost guarantee more people would have bought from gox. 
I almost did at one point but stopped after being asked for paper work, which made me search for other exchanges and means to buy.

No it's not normal that a currency can lose half it's value upon some bad news. Thanks for ignoring that point tho and half the points I made. 


It's not moving the goal post. There's more to performance then price. Look at AMD, they made record profits this year and yet the stock price fell. Like I said I want my dollar to be worth the same today and tomorrow. The fact that it's not with bitcoin proves awful performance and lack of confidence. How can you have a currency with a low confidence? You can't.

The problem is it can take up to 20 minutes to receive a single confirmation.

There won't ever be a revolution because bitcoin will never be easier to use then a credit card. 
Plus the whole confirmation time fiasco means after purchasing something you might have to wait up to 20 minutes for a single transaction. 
Bitcoin will never start any type of revolution aslong as this problem exists. 
But like I said it's great for international money transfers so atleast you got that going for bitcoin.

There will always be people who don't think something will pan out, it's an awwwwwful comparison no matter how you try to say. And my point still stands. For every 1 that did pan out a thousand dint. And guess what, there were people who were right about those failed ideas too. 
You still have something invested though, I invest in stocks and I know what it's like to have an emotional bias towards what I'm ready to lose. Iv lost over 5k on some stocks that in my head i saw as the greatest companies out there and I couldn't see the bad because of that emotional bias. And that's what scares me about bitcoiners, a lot of people here are falling for circlejerking non sense and aren't able to process all the bad stuff that bitcoin has with it. People really think that there's nothing wrong with bitcoin and that's a BIG problem.

The circlejerkyness and down voting of anything bad has caused a lot of pain and that's why there needs to be people like me going around reminding people that bitcoin is not all good, there's a lot of bad and a lot of risks.

Because Xmas isint the time to give shity gift. If you wanna spread awareness then do it on any other day. Christmas is not for that. Christmas is not a time to share you're beliefs. 
This is equivalent to giving people bibles for Christmas and telling them itl be worth it in the end when we end up in heaven. It's pathetic. 
How the fuck are you people even trying to justify you're shity behaviour. If you wanna look like an awkward asshole then go ahead. But be warned that you will be alienated and known as "that asshole" that gave horrid gifts during Xmas.

I fully understand bitcoin, I have for many years and as an investor I will never put any money towards it. 
It's not fear of what they don't understand, it's assessing risk/reward. Many people see bitcoin as a big risk and don't wanna take it. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:31:11
Yes but who is deciding the price of bitcoin right now? 
We all know hype is driving the price of bitcoin up. Not innovations.
So gamblers and SPECULATORS are driving the price up and they will be the first to cash out at the first sign of trouble.  
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:54:45
Theres a huge difference between fluctuating prices and high volatility like bitcoin.

The circlejerking and idiocy thought process going on in this thread is outstanding. Essentially boiling down too "they're all stupid and shills because they don't like bitcoin" 
There's A LOT of reasons to not support bitcoin and if you people don't know them all then you honestly shouldn't be investing in something you know nothing about. Economists, investors, normal people who don't want bitcoins make a lot of great points against it and r/bitcoin ignores it because "to the mooooon durrrrr" 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:00:01
If 85% of your total sales then you have an advertising/demand problem. It's not because you don't wanna pay 10% with amazon or pay paypal. It's because the only people who are finding out about your business are finding it thru your advertising on bitcoin sites. 
Selling with amazon might actually help you. Yes it would cost you more to get the product out, and you might see less profit per item sold. But if you sell 10x more then it's worth it and you'll make more money. 
So no, bitcoin dint save your business, it's a stretch.

Whoops my mistake, but my point still stands, bitcoin does regularly lose a few % points in 5 mins. 


So at what point does it become stable, it's funny you seem to think those 2 things are deciding it and not speculators and big time players in bitcoin running up the price. 
1000% rise in price based on hype? Are you kidding me? You people actually think that makes sense 
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:50:01
It's just hype, and a 1000% price hike based on nothing but hype is not a good thing, I hope people realize that.

I'm not a judge on gifts... But if I bought 20$ lottery tickets how happy would everyone be receiving them? 
Oh and I can't do anything with those lottery tickets for a few more years (realistically). 
Like other people thought of what a good gift for me would be, ITS THE THOUGHT THAT MATTERS, when I think is someone gifting bitcoin all I can think about is them pushing bitcoins so more people will use it and itl be worth more. I find that selfish. No one wants a 20$ bill or lottery tickets for Xmas.

Stop trying to justify your shity behavior. Its a shity thing to do so stop even thinking about it.
If you wanna give people money then give them gift cards or cash. not bitcoins cause nobody wants to go thru the bitcoin hassle to get it set up and be able to actually spend it.
Its a shity anti social dick move. So stop it. You people make bitcoin look bad.

The reason circlejerkers are getting attacked is because they're going around yelling "TO THE MOUUUUNNNNN GHYZZZZZ" "BIGCOIN WILL BE 10,000 BY JAN guyZzzzzzzz" and it's causing people who have very little knowledge about what they're getting into to buy bitcoin. 
When these people who just buy because of hype realize the price is falling they're the first to sell. 
And there's absolutely nothing wrong with attacking those with too much optimism who are pretty much lying to everyone. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:28:47
It's insane that people actually think bitcoin is worth 500$ right now. Bitcoin is at 500$ because of GAMBLERS AND INVESTORS THAT ARE TRADING EVERY SECOND.
 
not because people see the potential of it in the future and are trying to put as much money as they can into it. 
Once these gamblers and traders make their money they're gonna pull out of bitcoin and take their cash and we all know what type of reaction that will cause the rest to do. 
And no it's too early to go all in on bitcoin, governments haven't decided laws on them yet. There's a whole issue that's going to be created when the gov realizes that your all buying and selling stuff tax free. The government is going to do something about it. 


No it's not, the market is giving you an overestimate based on nothing but hype and..... Nothing. That is not a good thing.

Sending a gift with the sole purpose of pushing your beliefs is NOT COOL. 
I would seriously be bummed If I actually got you a nice gift and in return got a piece of paper with a number on it that most people won't be able to understand.

It wasn't, it was just a lot of people wanting to sell and GOX not wanting to let people well because they know that's their business.

How can you even compare any of these to bitcoin. It's silly. It's retarded. It's pure idiocy and only people on r/bitcoin would look at it and go "DUUUUUUUR SUCH GREAT POINTS."

If this cult was smart a lot of you would be selling now and then rebuying a lot more after the bubble. 
A 50% INCREASE BASED ON NOTHING BUT SPECULATION IS NOT A GOOD SIGN.

I frequent r/investing. 
A 1000% rise based on nothing but hype it not a good thing.. If there was something actually backing bitcoin like the world governments approve of it then yes ofcourse it's understandable. 
But that hasn't happened, and hype is really the only thing driving the price up. Many in r/investing know that's not a good thing. Every bitcoiner should be admitting that bitcoin is hugely over valued. 
So no, no one in r/investing is mad and no one will suddenly feel bad about losing out on the opportunity, part of investing is sometimes you miss the boat, and you suck it up and live with it. No cry about it and make a poor decision of investing in something grossly over valued.

Just so everyone knows... RT is and has always been a TERRIBLE news source. 
Not to be trusted on anything they report. Run by the Russian gov and mostly has an anti American agenda.

No... It's not even close to stabilizing..... Just because it's fluctuating upwards it doesn't mean it stabilized. 
And you believe that the entire rise was based on so many people rushing to buy bitcoins and not market manipulators? 
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:27:47
Except the price of gold was stable at the time  
You know, stability, what makes a currency.

The assignment might have been he has to teach all this to other kids. 
And no other kid got it so he got a 0. 
Please don't take this kids word for it, teachers don't give Fs for age inappropriate work. It's most likely bs or he dint do something that caused the F. 
Seriously... Cyber school? What the fuck is that shit.

I can't believe this has to be repeated again but DO NOT GIVE THESE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH BITCOIN. 
Gifts are not suppose to be used to push your economic/political beliefs, it makes you look extremely selfish and it's a huge dick move. 
No one wants to put up with the hassle of bitcoin when they actually bought you a decent gift. Seriously, if you do this, you're just an asshole.
