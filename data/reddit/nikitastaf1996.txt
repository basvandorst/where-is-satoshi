It is not about protecting.It is about recovering.And you dont have some id that you would remember.You know your email address.It easy to remember.You use it often.While you know it you can recover it.You can recover it even without knowing it.If you have mobile number connected to it.But you cant remember every bit of file.Or text phraze.And if you lose it you dont have ways to recover it.

But this text phrase can be lost too.I hardly think anyone will memorize it.And im not the first who will lose it.  The deal is if you using the email you always remember your password , your email address and you always have way to recover password while knowiing email address.  If you dont know security question you have sms recovery.You can always recover sim card from your carrier.In blockchain if you lost wallet.dat/text phrase you lose everything.You dont know "email address".

"Eat that" Slang When you win in dispute (according to dictionary)(it is quite hard to explain concepts that you know natively). "Выкуси loser".
