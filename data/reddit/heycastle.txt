Well I don't expect to without the internet, which is why I asked if people do it with their laptops? Is it pretty much impossible or just "infra dig" to spend bitcoin without using a mobile phone?...
OK so I guess now can somebody recommend a good phone and where to get it from... :o

So where do my bitcoins have to be in order to spend them in a cafe/restaurant? Can they be in my localbitcoins wallet or do they need to be in a private wallet?

But how complicated is it to have the coin converted straight into £s? As I've never seen how Bitpay or Coinbase works, how should I wisen myself up to this before pitching it to them?

So I guess they need an android at the counter to get started yeah?

lol well I can understand that I just wasn't sure what blockchain merchant was.
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:29:06
Is Blockchain Merchant an alternative to Bitpay and Coinbase? or would they need to sign up to one of those sites as well?
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:38:15
So this Blockchain Merchant, does it trade your btc into gbp instantly for you like Bitpay does?

That's the thing, I'm really into bitcoin but I haven't owned a phone in years.. so I'm actually a little unsure what a smart phone even is lol. I don't even have a TV! So is that the only way?

OK great thanks, so out of curiosity and if you don't mind satisfying it xD -- Have you been to a place that accepts bitcoin? And what phone do you use?

Ohh you are Adam Guerbuez, the 873 million dollar man. Give me a million and I'll remove it. =D

Wow, what a loser. :o

Well, here is evidence that some people knew:
And check out all the weird retweeting by empty faceless bots.
Something stinks.

Aww thanks buddy.. That'll help get my kid through University. :')
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:49:22
OK thanks for your explanations, I accept that he maybe just knew as much as everyone else and it was in the air.
But why all the random retweets by empty bot twitter accounts? I mean, I asked him how did he know in advance and I've been getting 3 retweets a minute by accounts that you just couldn't call real people. What does everyone make of shit like that?...
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:27:10
And since Bitstamp went down today, what he said on Twitter has been retweeted hundreds of times by a bunch of empty faceless bot profiles, as have the tweets in response to him.
It's weird.

It's about as lost as a fishing line in the river, a big fish has already took the bait, now we just gotta reel it back in (up).

So many dumb people in here who can't think outside the box... Really you think saying we're enslaved by the banks is an offence to REAL slavery? Grow a brain man.. Your politically-correct delusions are an offence to reality.
Of course we are slaves to money, that is blatantly obvious to anyone who's been thinking for themselves the last millenia. Isn't this what bitcoin is all about - breaking free from the CHAINS of the current financial system? So why are you all jumping on a guy for using the term 'slavery' to describe what you all should know is happening? If in the next few months they manage to shut down the whole bitcoin dream -basically sending home a message that we as a people in a so-called "democracy" shall not have an alternative - will you still believe you are free? Wake up.
