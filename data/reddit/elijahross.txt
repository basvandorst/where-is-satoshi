No bitcoin is not a government controlled thing the government has no rights to take money gained from something they had no influence on. Taxation is theft

Trezor 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:01:02
You lost me man ur semantics argument isn’t working. Bitcoin even while it evolves still is bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:15:36
Lightning network 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:17:27
It will stop soon enough, probably at the area they makes gun that tastes like a 3 course meal. Watch out for the blueberry though 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:17:01
Hahahaha! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:55:05
That is very sad and to think if he would have waited he would have got everything he dreamed of 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:29:01
What do you mean 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:17:54
[here’s one]( 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:50:25
Well it would be easier to sell if coinbase allowed it 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:55:38
Yes then put it in coinbase after we own a bunch of it 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:02:50
Having phds doesn’t automatically make you smart. They show your mastery of certain skills. Your article ( I assume) doesn’t mention blockchain technology and it’s potential, however I agree bitcoin is a bubble because of all of the hype from average people aka your “ Trump supporters” but I do not agree it’s worthless. It has a lot of potential to be the next evolution of currency since currency will always evolve. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:30:12
rethink that statement too. “I knew the answer before I asked” then why did you ask. “Too much money to risk” “ I’d rather play cards” genius. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:35:51
Ew no

How many did u find 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:11:17
No it’s not, it was a fork. The block chain split and it became its own thing. That isn’t an evolution that’s a creating 2 different things. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:40:30
Yes it is Lel Xd 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:45:35
Could be, i don’t know. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:02:17
It’s stopped now the oompahs are resting reading for a hard row 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:41:53
No this is very different. Bitcoin will always be bitcoin. Regardless if it evolves it’s still bitcoin. Pieces aren’t removed and replaced. New technology is implemented. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:15:14
No by forking I mean it is a split in bitcoins block. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:36:31
Speaking ur mind is different than saying bitcoin needs to be replaced, I’m speaking how bitcoin needs to evolve vs you saying it needs to be replaced. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:04:06
Hahaha 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:26:32
Lol what did ur sister say. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:30:34
I was being generous maybe he got held back
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:12:15
I had the same idea too bad we didn’t do it 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:47:45
Very true.

Risky move man. Be careful reduce risks and buy other alt coins too 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:08:13
They cannot put you in jail for not conforming to social norms without a just cause, me saying taxing bitcoin is theft is not just cause for my mental illness 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:26:27
“I didn’t buy bitcoin when I heard about it and I donated money to Hillary and now I’m mad that I’m a moron” - the actual title. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:04:50
You got scammed 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:30:48
Almost 10 bucks 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:52:37
Excellent use of “doofus” 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:36:43
Jeez what coin did he buy 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:14:13

I’m hodling for 2.5 years then reevaluating
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:12:25
Ur question was maybe 6th grade level math.  Don’t act surprised people are making fun of you 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:25:31
Just wait for lightning network 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:36:48
No it does not mean you are highly intelligent it means you have mastered a skill, you can have a PhD in gender study’s and not be intelligent in the slightest. I did read ur article. You did not mention any reasons why it’s a Ponzi scheme worth 300 billion. Also there have been major investors. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:28:28
How many btc are in them 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:42:46
If you have the billion to spend go for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:38:21
It’s probably not an exaggeration but you should ask him and tell me haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:10:24
I feel really bad for all these noobs. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:14:21
So? You understood it 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:57:02
Again, no idea maybe 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:57:01
Wow no surprise there, communists. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:38:12
Ok? Go lose money in card games. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:36:08
Ya I sold my home to buy bitcoin at 19k then I got scared and sold when it went below 13k. It’s a pyramid scheme!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:03:11
What right do they have over bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:53:43
It’s not wise for 5 year olds to mess with Mom and dads credit cards 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:44:55
Roger ver is a moron confirmed 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:15:42
Haha right now it seems the shit is winning. Rip bitcoin noobs, remember kids, buy high sell low 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:28:24
That’s all I’m asking for this year 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:37:45
If we didn’t get credited on coinbase how do we get it 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:51:42
Bitcorn is supposed to hit 18 trillion Nigerian dollars ($0.00001 usd) by 2020 I would do it 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:26:45
But I like the story’s 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:34:06
Well obviously that’s what happens on this forum, it’s super bias. Nothing is perfect, hopefully it continues to evolve. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:56:27
Hahaha. No 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:17:09
Ok? Next time re-think “your” question. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:59:22
Why not both? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:11:06
Seemed a little unclear for a newish person. But I agree ❤️
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:13:35
Sign up for coinbase.

I don’t really want a super heavy crash but a dip is always nice

Oh no cryptos are a fraud how will I spend my money in Morocco...
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:28:26
Ya probably 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:35:38
Sell price? What’s that 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:39:50
There are lots of cryptos that have large upsides but I don’t think any will go from 8 cents to 10k in the foreseeable future. It was created to replace fiats all other coins have just followed on the coat tails. The only value prediction I have is to the moon! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:26:22
Watch bithumb it’s Asia bitcoin price Watch it’s way higher than American 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:38:23

Premature celebration ruined it 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:39:42
It’s a pretty nice mountain though the more you build it up the more you make while it moves. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:25:50
If it ever does it will be the only global currency 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:57:54
I lost 0.2 from 2012 because I was a stupid kid who didn’t keep track of keys 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:22:06
Hahahaha close but it’s a stock term for more buyers than sellers 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:18:24
No taxes on bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:02:43
People trading fiat for crypto 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:01:40
There are a few companies like this most are kinda vague but as long as they are making you money why not. Just watch them very close and if there are any bad signs pull out 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:17:27
! ? Don’t ! ? Understand ! ? Your ! ? Accent 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:56:46
Buy a little every week when it’s stable, buy as much as you can when it’s down(or move some into an alt coin but go back to bitcoin once bitcoin starts moving back up). Then watch as you make money 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:28:02
My b 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:40:04
Buy more 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:38:48
No you shouldn’t sell but people will, the best time to buy is when it’s low 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:33:29
Mine is a little different, one of the transactions was going into an investment that had a timed wallet code that I would assume changes for safety reasons, is that coin lost? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:22:27
You’re smart.

Neither tops nor drys had rally’s anywhere near as good as bitcoin, plus to pull off even a gain from either of those you have to had bought and sold at the right times or you were going to lose money. Bitcoin has been increasing since its creation. It also can be used to buy things, unlike stocks.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:47:15
This makes me physically sick 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:40:54
Yes you can use it for many things and the places you can use it increases weekly

Bye roger ver 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:32:18
Try trezor

This is China’s bitcoin exchange they are usually a few days ahead of the American market.

@_date: 2017-11-25 14:55:06

@_date: 2017-11-30 00:38:53
Trezor or ledger 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:22:24
Yep 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:53:48
It’s a bear trap! In stock terms
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:58:07

This usually happens at dips like this. Oh well wait for next time 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:47:18
Watching the Chinese markets is a good indicator, when they hit 10k I’ll watch to see if it dips I expected it to when it hit 9 but it didn’t 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:55:49
Idk I saw this happen at 8k and buyers smashed the profit takers 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:50:40

Final? Hahaha more like end of the tutorial 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:04:40
Umm bitcoin is definitely out preforming equities. Also when did drys run 2500 percent I never saw that and I have traded that before. Nvdas percent increase numbers are nowhere near bitcoins. No stocks have relatively consistent 50 percent monthly increases 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:54:56
Just think of the lambo in a few years 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:30:52
The thing is, what is going to happen when it hits 10k 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:05:29
Buy more 
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:23:44
I have the address but I can’t figure out if there’s a way to get it out of blockchain and move it to my wallet
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:44:49
What if it doesn’t dip? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:20:12
9300 in a few months will be a crash
