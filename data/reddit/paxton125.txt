how many bitcoin users does it take to change a lightbulb?
five. one to stare at the flickering bulb as it fluctuates, and four to harass the first saying that he should just change it.
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:06:35
but still its nice, and free for you. dont be an ingrate.
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:34:39
exactly. and have you ever upgraded a laptop CPU? IIRC they are harder to come by and expensive.
@_date: 2014-08-05 20:37:56
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:06:01
yeah. they don't seem to understand that if they start to pull more of this shit, they won't be able to throttle someone's bolt cutter connections. they wont be able the throttle the person. all they can do is watch as we tear them apart. Just because you provide a commodity doesn't mean that people wont go without it for a little while so they can go without you for a long while.
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:15:59
which is mainly what i meant. so it isn't really something you would want to do.

why are RU prices lower, and how lower are they?
@_date: 2014-06-16 00:42:32

i uh.... i think he sounds fucking fishy. you?
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:16:50
yeah. i mean, usually the "iz bettr" people are just circlejerking, but now i think its pretty true. people around here on one half are just posting memes and not totally understanding everything, but thats okay. and the other half is just being the exact thing they claim to hate- people only caring about money, people who treat everything like a stock market. and then, scattered around, is the people like you and the OP. people just trying to get everyone to calm their tits, have a tea or something, and then understand that btc wont die this fast.

alienware is good for the 10-16 year olds who want to show how fucking hardcore they are and how much of a 'total nerd gamer' they can be. IT EVEN HAS A BACKLIT KEYBOARD SO YOU CAN WRITE ABOUT HOW MUCH OF A RETRO NERD YOU ARE SINCE YOU PLAY ON THE PLAYSTATION 2 ON YOUR WORDPRESS

@_date: 2014-07-24 21:23:43
yep. here's a good list of alternatives:
super powerful, great components, but heavy and thick (heh like alienwares): asus ROG series
powerful, stylish, portable and build quality: lenovo y series
stylish, stylish, and status symbol: that nifty razer laptop with a touchscreen on the keyboard
for desktops:
1. build your own. better than anything else.
2. web botiques (xoticPC and the like)
3. a local computer store

or tell the police. nobody understands how hard it actually is to shoot someone until they have firsthand experience.
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:35:16
yeah. it wouldnt be worth it if you actually wanted money, but once you see it you learn about it and either A: write it off as bullshit or B: spend all your money on it and turn it into the national currency. of the world.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:11:17
dont know, am not at home will check once i am on secure network.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:43:47
the fact that you can doesnt mean that you should. imagine knowing that because you couldnt be bothered to learn how to use a tazer which would take about an hour at most caused someone to die.
@_date: 2014-07-25 13:39:32
Alright, so here's how they will pay the tax. They send out the item, and its obvious they got 1k in btc. The gummint takes some of their money, not in BTC, as tax.

@_date: 2014-10-05 11:50:15
I don't feel like it. All I'm saying is, choose your standpoint. Want bitcoin to be illegal money? Let it be illegal money. Want to be harsh, selfish, and try to shove your political beliefs and bitcoin down everyones throat as fast as possible? Fine. But you're not allowed to cry when it hits a dead end.

there's a difference between flaunting about how you shot a cop yesterday and didnt get caught and telling someone that you illegally got something so you aren't in writhing agony.

lenovo's y series for example, or the ROG series.

No, like for a community of people to track things.
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:30:15
but dogecoin doesnt care about becoming a giant. dogecoin is about having enough to buy some donuts at the shops that take doge, and to watch it zip around in prices. and since everyone there is tipping generously and whatnot, the 10k would be split up around everyone.
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:19:11

@_date: 2014-05-05 14:06:52

@_date: 2014-02-12 03:10:59
yeah. it's why paper wallets are widely used, and why the price crash is so serious to people who had things relying on btc. but in a couple of weeks, at worst one or two months, it will be back up so dont worry.
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:57:23
no, i just think that you should stop using terms that are offensive. from your account history, it is obvious that you are a teenager or preteen who thinks that being rude makes you look cool in front of your big boy friends.
@_date: 2014-01-01 19:09:51
dude, most people over the age of sixty hold the most power. you don't want to fight them, you want to convince them that it's good. otherwise, people keep on fighting bitcoin, and while that might be a hard fought battle, it will definitely hold this down.

@_date: 2014-01-01 21:20:01
and then you still look suspicious. they see you at atm, they see you on the cam feed at the pot store a couple minutes later.
@_date: 2014-01-01 21:23:24
you can use localbitcoins, or a simular system, but not really.

how many meals would it provide for, assuming it is to feed around 3 or four people?
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:52:56
thats...... oh god.
and i thought the crusty 1-ply in the target bathroom was shitty.
@_date: 2014-01-19 22:37:50
around 1/2 months ago. way faster than USD changes.
@_date: 2014-02-01 05:26:59
eh, but thats how it went with BTC. if it follows the path of BTC since it is the second most popular reddit cryptocurrency, we can expect it to be worth something soon.

1. alright, lemme just take this super expensive (and thick) mechanical keyboard (there aren't any 60% boards non mechanical)

whoa, calm down.
first off, i am a student. i'd say i'm pretty fucking careful with my money.
BUT, i still think that the premium for a laptop is okay for a student. 
for one, especially if you have a lot of places to go to, i somehow feel like your classroom wont have a power strip and a fucking TV for you to hook up to.
for two, i doubt a coffee shop will have a private monitor for you.
for three, you then need to get a portable keyboard. for anything not shit and/or not a huge wide board that wont fit in a backpack, it costs AT LEAST another hundred dollars.

@_date: 2014-06-28 13:29:12
yeah. plus, theres a chance that bitcoin is pushed out of the way. a global, government centered currency. we got what we asked for, but we should have been more specific.
@_date: 2014-01-15 23:19:34

this was mentioned before, it was because btc was the least used option.

you should tell your PD about it, threats like that are serious matters.

@_date: 2014-03-08 15:50:16
no, if it becomes a based/official currency, governments will begin to offer "benefits" to bitcoin miners and/or make a huge mining rig of their own, mine out a shitload of coins, sell off the rigs and kill the benefits, and then its just a currency.

and i am very pro guns, and pro gun rights, i am just against killing other people unless its the only possible choice.
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:28:33
1. compared to a laptop keyboard it is. unless you got shitty keys that are always depressed, it takes up around the thickness of a usual laptop.
2. definitely.
3. yeah, to a LAN party. not inside of a backpack with books AND A FUCKING DESKTOP.
4. yes, on the other hand i would gladly pay a slight premium for both more portability and 1080p wherever i am.

anti-theft would be easy, just add a small arduino that notices if it's off the ground or being tampered with and sets off an insanely high decibel (100-200) alarm for five seconds.
maybe a few days and then nobody touches the damn things out of fear of losing their hearing.

alright, here's a quick explanation of what you did. you recommended getting a portable case (50-100 dollars) and since normal boards are usually too big, getting a 60% mech like your poker 2, which AT MINIMUM will cost 70 dollars.
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:17:44
its probably because the bitcoin community has become filled with people either in it to make quick cash or libertarians trying to "smash the system" or something like that. im all for bitcoin, but the status quo of the community is filled with people who dont understand comradery.

if you have a USD credit card, go to britain or spain, or probably even italy. the debt is good in a way, it means that they are less likely to attack us until we return the money. or explained like you are really five,

dogecoin reminds me of pre-boom bitcoin, from when people were actually tipping others and most people didnt just post a picture of their QR code with a quote from someone or printed onto legos. everyone who actually posts in the subreddit is joking and throwing coins around to people whenever they ask for them or say they are new, or even just ask for some coins. Bitcoin might be more powerful, but dogecoin has more personality.

yep. personally (dont know much about economics) bitcoin will be replaced by someothing else. the community is becoming hateful (or at least was when i stopped frequenting it) and a good portion of the people are either begging for tips (another thing that was going on at least when i left) or treating it as fancy stocks.

how do we get bitcoin? also, why should people care?
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:02:41
they are not resistant to innovation, it is just that bitcoin is still unstable, as awesome as it is. and since there are large corperations, they would rather not need to shut down a ton of things since they decided to make bitcoin an option, everyone used it, suddenly huge market crash and valve is dead.

oh. but wouldnt a normal computer be able to mine in the mining pools and get bitcoins at a smaller rate?
@_date: 2013-09-22 20:37:45
also, what does flip verify mean/do?
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:35:53
a douche trying to whore for bitcoins by stealing someone's fame.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:10:43
why would they do that?
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:52:12
actually, i bet that if i walked into a store with a gold brick, grabbed some item that i wanted, gave the gold brick to the cashier and walked away i would be fine.

now i'm expecting a cyber red dawn thing.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:03:51
sorry, but this doesnt seem to be related to bitcoin. dont wanna be that guy, but i became him.
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:28:29
i think you just wanted to buy doge last crash.
@_date: 2013-08-29 21:35:57
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:39:52
ah. then in that case, you should probably not use bitcoin, as that is a more expensive thing than just a food truck or coffee shop.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:58:40
you can... give them to me?
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:27:56
well, i'm still seeing a lot of "omg my bank account with all mah moneyz was frozen because i haz bitcoin" and such.
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:39:58
what is a respectable and working faucet?
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:40:52

darknet? YO DOCTOROW! GET OVAH HERE!
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:57:27
the biggest downside i think is the way that many organizations react to it, instantly treating you as if you were a criminal upon seeing the word bitcoin near your name.
@_date: 2013-09-22 19:24:23
i agree with that in whole. Bitcoin tipping seems like it will soon mostly replace reddit gold, because it is able to be cheaper than a gift of reddit gold, and can be used on more than just reddit.
@_date: 2013-10-02 00:29:54
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:51:50
yeah, but that isnt what he wanted. he has a visa card, he can use that on steam, but he wanted drm free.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:14:02
does it spit out physical bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:33:41
can you plot the amount of times you have made polar coordinates?
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:34:44
its a picture of a reciept with the words "used gyft for the first time" above it. i dont want to be a dick, but that doesnt look bitcoin related.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:30:23
pretty much just reversing the whole "nyah people have at one point used btc for illegal stuff" thing back on the people who do the stereotyping.
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:48:37

@_date: 2013-10-15 21:07:47
we must make people start using bitcoin to buy this!
@_date: 2013-12-26 22:09:13
yeah, but the computers need to cool and have people check them for errors and fragmentations.
@_date: 2013-09-26 21:58:47
yes, is joke. i am sorry. i sit in corner of shame and aol.
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:29:32
i would mix dogecoin and bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:06:22
latvia. his potatocoin is very important.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:21:29
no, but you can find someone's IP address. some girl got her house broken into for facebook posting a photo of some cash.
@_date: 2013-10-05 15:06:08
how could i mine just for fun? like, a few mbtc or something every week. that would still be enough. also, if it can be done in a browser then awesome.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:10:15
i see no robot steamships or cybernetic limbs.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:55:54
cool scare tactics? what?
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:02:59
alright, then sorry if i hurt you.
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:49:49
ok, well thats what i meant.
@_date: 2013-09-22 20:59:24
thank you so much.
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:27:40
can i have some doge?
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:07:51
you should make some way to verify, someone could definitely just say they lost 5 btc. and suddenly you're out 20k.
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:38:46
oh. and thanks.
@_date: 2013-09-22 19:16:41
@_date: 2013-10-06 00:07:04
aww. and i was all excited...
@_date: 2013-10-18 00:35:01
what happens when you donate? it says they give you a reciept and something extra, is the something extra an achievement?
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:55:07
agreed. i would rather get a bitcoin than a dogecoin, but the btc community takes shit way too seriously. they even acknowledge it will be back up soon, but they still flip their shit when it crashes.
@_date: 2013-10-28 22:59:13
well, you could also use the fact that you will get the cash to them as fast as possible.
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:26:31
i think you do it more like "+/u/ (insert recipient username here) _ internets"
@_date: 2013-10-25 18:53:07
and imagine if he had bought 1 bitcoins worth in bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:37:28
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:01:13
NO, 1337 IS. LEEEEEEEEEET SKILLZ, YO.
@_date: 2013-10-13 01:11:46
cool, you are monitoring this stuff. if you are still here, is there anything that the general populace could do to help with making more games available?
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:04:37
i do believe it is from v for vendetta originally, in case you didn't already know. if you haven't read that book then you should, most libraries will have a version of it in stock.
@_date: 2013-10-02 00:41:18
then they potato?
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:27:00
uh... ROMERADE ME, BITCH!
@_date: 2013-10-02 00:33:57
@_date: 2013-10-16 20:59:59
start a thread where i give a bitcoin to anyone who asks. do that until i am down to 8000 btc, and transfer portions to a few wallets that are heavy password secured.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:21:37
with that logic, everything is the same. that coffee shop? they sold money to a gangbanger who killed someone the other day. that bank? a con artist used them to launder money. the old game store? someone sold off hundreds of dollars of stolen gear to them.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:28:25
plot twist- OP is satoshi nakamoto.
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:40:01
well, i'm sold.
