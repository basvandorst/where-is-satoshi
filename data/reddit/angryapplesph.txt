fantastic to see your approach to this - I'd love to be in a position to do exactly what you're doing
I can't lie, if I found myself in your position, I would most definitely go down the lambo/nice car/holidays etc route, but I'd like to think my spends would also be very large amounts to charity like you :-)
Anyway, to your original Q OP:
I'd like to put forward any charities involved in research and support for Dystonia
I am a sufferer myself, but am fortunate enough to be one of those that only has (reasonably) mild symptoms
I have, however, met many that are severely disabled by this awful disease which very little is known about (I myself had seen many doctors with various symptoms from my early teens, but i was only diagnosed in my early 30's)
As a brief run down, Dystonia is similar to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but ifs more often than not non degenerative (Parkinsons symptoms are in fact secondary Dysonia, in that the Dystonic movement (spasms etc) are secondary to the main Parkinson's disease, whereas in Primary Dystonia it is in and off itself)
As I have said, my symptoms are quite mild, but I have the rarer form, global Dystonia that can affect many parts of the body - I myself suffer from severe writers cramp (it hurts to write more than a sentence), weakness in the right leg, and, for me at least, the worst - Laryngeal Dysphonia that makes me sound very, very hoarse to the point phone calls are near impossible and face to face conversations quite difficult, especially as strangers often assume I have a stammer.
For me, a very social, outgoing person this is a nightmare, but as I have said, mild compared to others I have met.
I feel very, very little is known of Dystonia both in the medical profession and the public at large and so this would be an area that would benefit greatly from a decent donation to assist awareness and research.
I am aware that you have a VERY large amount of responses, so if you do read this I thank you for your time to read my 2 cents!
Whether you decide to donate to Dystonia or not, I congratulate you on your approach to this new found wealth, and wish you the very best in finding a way to achieve the most for humanity with your generous gifts.
