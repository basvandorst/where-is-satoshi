I hear you and those are obviously valid concerns. But what if we collectively did it? Wouldn't the banks go bankrupt? Cryptos would soar and all of those things you mentioned become irrelevant.

The banks lend those trillions of dollars out assuming that they will recoup their investments with the costs included(default and non payment) by charging high interest rates. If people were using their credit to buy crypto and not paying it back, the banks would eventually have to stop lending money because it's not profitable. Thus freezing current credit markets and further making the banks more and more irrelevant. Eventually, and there are plenty of caveats that could derail this, but society will become crypto based. Those who bought crypto with credit would have made a wise decision, and the banks would be left holding a bunch of bad debt.

I think there's lots of reasons to want to do that. For instance we'd do it as a means to end the banking cartels. Because that's largely what the banks have done to us already in the form of government bailouts. Cryptocurrency allows for anyone to basically become their own bank in many aspects. The services that banks offer are increasingly less valuable but more expensive. Because the banks lend money with an assumed risk. If you use x amount of credit today to buy crypto, that could become 2x tomorrow or whatever.

Hypothetical question here. Would it be a good idea to max out all your credit with banks to purchase crypto with the intention of never paying it back? Couldn't we cripple the current credit/banking system by collectively doing this?

My credit score is perfect. You what that has ever gotten me?
Nothing more than endless amounts of credit card offers.
