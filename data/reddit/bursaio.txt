That's the problem. Bitcoin has major volatility right now and is not a safe bet. But what's interesting about Bitcoin is the amazing toolset they are going to enable going forward.

First off, we were actually looking for this exact tool. We all use 1Password, but wanted an easy way to share company passwords, and this is perfect haha.
Second, that's very close to what we are trying to do. Both in terms of hierarchical wallet access, and being able to provision temporary assets. Thinking provisioning an employee $60 to spend on stationary and having whatever they don't spend by the end of the day make it's way back to department level accounts. That way there is never that residual $1.56 that is annoying to transfer back/account for!

Hey, thanks for the question!
In short, no. We think there are lots of great options in that space already. We're more interested in building tools for once you've already got Bitcoin from getting paid in it and are looking to do more than just sell it for USD. Ideally we want business to take the BTC they've earned and use it to pay employees, expenses, advertising, etc with it.

Exactly. A use case could be that you run a Welding Company and have an employ who has daily allowances/perks:
Gas: Unlimited(Whitelisted Wallet ID's)
Coffee: $5(Budget Segment Labelled Wallet ID's)
Supplies: $200(Specific Supplier Wallet ID)
Assuming this is the case, as long as your employee is performing transactions with wallet ID's that have been recognized/pre-approved by you/your accounting team, then we can hypothetically enforce these restrictions. 
As for blacklisting, in practice you probably aren't going to blacklist a whole lot of things unless you have given your employee a generic per diem to work with!
Hope that helps.

Hmmm, I personally recommend against Node.js for a weekend hack project. Asynch is nice to have but is really annoying when you are just trying to get shit to work. Plus Armoury, a security layer over Bitcoin Core, is written in Python so that makes it easier to interface with. And if you have someone who can rock Django, even better for getting shit done quick.
As for ideas, maybe a tool for covering group tabs? So 5 of you go out for a meal, you get a tab of $40 and you don't want to go through the hassle of splitting bills/doing tips separately so you pool your money together with Bitcoin from separate wallets and then pay a single bill. That's more of a mobile app.
Mobile is interesting because there are so many tools that can be built for it still. Plus you get a nice separation between your UI and your backend.

It's definitely a possibility, but it's not what our core focus is on. If there were great enough demand, or we could implement it in a low number of cycles, we would consider it. The issue is that if a company who specializes in payroll integrates Bitcoin, then what we are SOL. Whereas the tools we are building are unique to Bitcoin/Virtual Currencies and cannot be implemented simply by hooking a Bitcoin API into an existing system.
Great question though, we definitely had to think it through for a bit before responding.

*Cough*  *Cough*. Well... I guess everyone would have to sign off on every transaction which kind of sucks. I'm currently working on HD wallets that would actually solve this exact problem.

Whoops, thanks for the heads up! Back up and running.

Hey, thanks for being the first to respond, we really appreciate it. Do you mind iterating on point  a bit more? What does a typical interaction or payment flow between you and your customer look like?
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:40:28
Hey, we've actually decided to head in that direction as our first major feature. We think our initial idea is more interesting, but we need to help make Bitcoin more accessible first before we introduce the advanced feature set that is super cool.
PM me if you're at all interested or have any specific use cases in mind. We're really close to having a prototype ready, we just need to add some features/UI around it.
@_date: 2014-10-16 18:57:05
Hmm, we're interested in this sort of thing as well. Creating a visual tool would be pretty useful, although keeping it IDE independent will give both you and us the most flexibility. Bouns points for JSON output.

This is still a hypothetical at this point, but is definitely on our road map once we have some of our more basic features in place. It also happens to be one of the features we are most excited about.
Essentially, the idea is that as services begin to adopt Bitcoin they will want to publish their public hot wallet ID's to help customers identify them. As an alternative, our users will be able to label destination wallet ID's, from their outbound transaction data, as given businesses with budgeting categorizations as they so choose.
From there you can do things like allocate bitcoin blocks with certain characteristics needed in order to complete transfers such as to X1,X2, or X3 wallet ID's(whitelisting) or to decline transfers to addresses Y1,Y2, and Y3(blacklisting).
This can be accomplished with:  if you are super interested.

Thanks, fixed yet again. We're having some issues with Launchrock it would seem.
