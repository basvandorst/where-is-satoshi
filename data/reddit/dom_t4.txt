7.1a (The previous version) *looks* okay. The part-audit [turned up]( no backdoors or serious insecurities. I've double checked today in several ways and there is no network traffic to or from Truecrypt 7.1. Of course, *you should still block all network connections to &amp; from Truecrypt to be safe*.
Stay away from 7.2. Let alone the fact that it's deliberately barely functional, the source code changes &amp; the tone of the website is beyond weird. A brief analysis from someone else indicates that there's no network traffic to/from 7.2 either, but obviously there hasn't been a deeper audit yet and consequently for both security &amp; practicality reasons you should stay away from 7.2.
You can still download [7.1 from FileHippo](

I wasn't basing the security risk off of the practical side of things. More the fact that it has been flagged as potential malware by several scanners, when previous versions haven't been, and the fact that nobody has had the chance to look through the source code for anything new/different/suspicious/etc. At least with 7.1-7.1a there's an ongoing audit which gives you a basis to feel secure or insecure about Truecrypt from, but there's nothing out there on 7.2 yet.

Aye to this. You can obtain the signatures from [here](

This is very true &amp; solid advice. I should've included it in my original comment, my apologies for not doing so.
*Trust but verify*.

Hmm. Whilst some of your points made are interesting, I feel the way this has been presented is rather... FUDtastic.
For a start, who is the "we" behind this post? You've created this account specifically to create this post, in both and demanding further information about and yet you yourself in creating this account for this purpose are hidden behind a veil of anonymity and have deliberately chosen to do so.
There is absolutely nothing to say that you aren't one of Prelude/Moolah's competitors out to tarnish the company for your own personal &amp; competitive advantage.
That's not an accusation, but rather a pretty obvious point to make. In hiding your identities in this post, whilst calling for additional transparency from it does look incredibly suspicious. There are plenty of people who would gain a lot from discrediting Moolah/Prelude; How can we be sure that you aren't one of them?
There has been a [ton]( of [anti-Moolah]( concern stirred up by anonymous accounts recently. 
Alex also very recently [deeply]( [p*ssed off]( Cryptorush, which is roughly when these sort of posts started to appear in various public forums.
Regardless of what your post states, it does start to look a bit like a witch-hunt when yet another new anonymous account pops up creating yet another anti-Moolah thread.
A1 Services is the registered address of 14500 companies, yes, but I think you're meandering into dangerous legal territory by slamming in an accusation that that particular company &amp; all who do business with it are scammers. The business that A1 Company Services are in isn't an uncommon one, and you'll find hundreds of similar companies in most countries.
Alex Green, incidentally, is British, resides in Switzerland, was born in November 1984, and owns 630 of the 1000 shares available in MOOPAY LTD. The other shareholders of MOOPAY LTD are:
* Alex Hatzenbuhler, Minnestota, The United States
* Landon Merrill, Washington, The United States
* Jonathon Brust, Illinois, The United States
* Jennifer Miller, Oregon, The United States
They are all registered at residential addresses, residential addresses which show no obvious ties to any additional companies. Apart from Jennifer, they are also [all listed publicly on Moolah's website]( as being company staff. Jennifer however is involved with Moolah &amp; publicly reveals so on her [LinkedIn]( Alex's [LinkedIn]( is there also, although fairly bare, for anyone particularly interested.
actually created a post two months ago in this very sub detailing a lot of how and why the company was created in the way it has been; [Here]( 
Basing Moolah's UK offices [in Bristol]( Alex is actually in the same city as I am. In which case, if anyone really wants verification of identity, I'm happy to offer to meet in Bristol and verify personally that he is a real person &amp; has real offices here. Given that the premise of this post is largely 'Ooh there's very little about him online' which turned out to be massive nonsense this shouldn't be necessary though, really.
As for *"Offer proof of liquidity and a walkthrough of the security measures they are using for their hot wallets"* - I don't think we've seen this from any major exchange? I certainly haven't seen MintPal, Cryptsy, etc throwing open their books to everyone, and I can't imagine they'll do so anytime soon.
I have my fears that this thread was created not out of concern, but out of malicious intent to somehow degrade business &amp; personal character, as has been the tone of most anti-Moolah posts since the Cryptorush incident.
For the record, I have no personal ties to Alex. I have no personal ties to Prelude or Moolah, except that I occasionally do a little trading on Prelude. I have no vested interest in seeing Moolah succeed or fail.

Sometimes I'm relieved that I don't live in the United States.
I'd like to preface my next comments by saying that I own no Bitcoin and absolutely, unequivocally implore people to avoid any attempted tax evasion or avoidance.
That said, I'm struggling to see how enforceable this latest notice from the IRS is. Crypto, by its nature, is already a difficult thing to trace, and since wallets require no identifying information to create will make tracing bitcoin back to an individual, identifiable user a small nightmare. Exactly how are the IRS intending to 1) Identify who owns every wallet in the United States. 2) Ensure the information offered by the tax return is accurate.
There's also the small issue of cold storage or deep cold storage. If you remove your bitcoin to deep cold storage, onto a platform that has never had contact with the internet, wouldn't that make it pretty much impossible to trace? Especially if the move to cold storage was done in small enough chunks to look like any regular transaction in Bitcoin.
Again, I'm not suggesting tax avoidance or evasion in any way, shape or form. But I struggle to see how the IRS intends or even could enforce this direction personally, and in making it this difficult for people to keep record of &amp; report in their tax returns it would only seem to push people away from that legal duty.

This will remain unknown for quite some time. Phase 1 of the Truecrypt audit [turned up]( nothing too worrisome. There are a few insecurities but nothing imminently dangerous or severe, and no signs yet of a potential backdoor.
Stay away from 7.2, for both security and practicality reasons. Truecrypt 7.1a is still available through [FileHippo]( and should you need to use a version of Truecrypt use 7.1a and not anything more recent.
It is worth taking the time to block all network connections to and from Truecrypt via your firewall. There are *no network connections* from 7.1a but it is much safer a practice to firewall things off if you have no need for them to access that specific service than otherwise.
