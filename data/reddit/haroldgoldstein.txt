Would have made a lot of money doing this over the past month.

Explain the intrinsic value of BTC being 13K to me, and I'll invest. It's really that simple. If you can show me a calculation bringing us anywhere near 13K, I'll buy.
Unless you can do that, your post is essentially saying "it happened in the past, therefore it will happen again". Which is truly a piss poor way of investing and is how a lot of people lose money.
BTC is the ultimate speculative investment based on essentially nothing. This makes it the most risky investment going.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:17:44
What about the people who are real investors and called BTC a bubble?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:26:06
BTC Futures weren't expected to bring any money into BTC because they were cash settled contracts.
No one even had to touch BTC at any point of the transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:39:17
Why? For what reason? Explain your call.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:20:47
THAT'S A BINGO!
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:23:55
This guy gets it.

Breakout based on?
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:02:25
2 years? more like 11 months.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:57:50
ahh, makes sense
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:19:33
Tell us your reasoning (or show us an intrinsic value calculation) behind 20K. I am all ears.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:24:59
Current data and events?
Anticipated data and events?
What this guy is essentially saying is,
“Last time it dropped 50%, we stayed at that level for XX amount of days, then went up 1000%. Because his happened before, it will happen again.”
This is pretty clearly an awful way to trade, I have no idea how you’re debating this.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:50:21


Making less informed decisions is never better.


This isn't true. He could be right 99&amp; of the time and still lose all his money on the 1&amp; All it takes is one poor trade.
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:13:45
Do people ever get tired of saying this?
We full on know that you're not buying next week if prices are like this or lower.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:04:39
Forecasting incorporates historical data. Never disputed this.
But solely relying on “well it happened in the past, so it will continue to happen” is ridiculous. And if this type of analysis is what people trading BTC rely on, then it’s quite sad to be honest.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:06:58


I feel like you're trying to take this topic away from what it was originally because you realize how stupid it is to say "Because it happened in the past the exact same thing will happen in the future."


This is a big assumption to make. Also, what if he buys now and it goes down to $100 without bouncing? There's no guarantee that it will recover.
If you're implying that he will not lose more than he originally invested, then yes you're right. But you can say this about almost everything unless you are leveraged. But once again, what does this have to do with the original conversation?
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:40:27
I didn’t say this, he did.
He said the exact same thing happens over and over again in bitcoin and it was easy to make money. He based this purely on the price and absolutely nothing else.
This is a ridiculous way to trade.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:20:14


We've never disagreed here. Forecasting based on historical data is a useful tool. But this isn't what he's doing. He hasn't developed a model regarding this, he's simply saying "because it happened in the past, it will happen again, the same way".
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:37:41
I’ve been hearing this type of talk since what, $15k?
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:37:21
How is current data no use as a long-term data point? What are you basing you’re long-term projection on if current data isn’t relevant? You can very easily see trends using current data.
Anticipated data is included in forecasting yes, I’ve never debated this.
But looking at the past price action without placing importance on context, is absolutely ridiculous.
Events are data, as everything is data. Unless when you talk about data you only mean numbers for some reason.
Once again, saying past events are a 100% guarantee of future events is absolutely ridiculous. I don’t get what issue we’re having here?
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:22:00
So we agree then?
This was a massive waste of time.
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:39:12
Sure pal.
Just like when we were at $17k then fell to $15k, then fell to $13k, then fell to $10k, then fell to $8k.
Or do you think i’m dumb enough to actually believe you weren’t telling yourself the same story the whole way down and you were just waiting for 4/5k?
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:18:36
Investing solely based on previous patterns is probably not the best thing to do.
There are tons of stocks/financial assets that I'm sure people are still waiting to recover which never will. Not saying this will happen with BTC, but to say "It repeats over and over. Not rocket science" speaks to inexperience.
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:30:02
Yes I'm sure.
Let me guess, bought at 1K sold at 20K? Or are you going to be more conservative with your BS and say something like bought at 5K sold at 12K?
Also, I'm sure you haven't bought back in on the massive fall from 20K either right?
If you've been trading BTC since it's inception (which you haven't), that's not even 9 full years. Very small amount of time to base your "theory" on.
I wish you well though, never want to see people lose money.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:31:18
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:32:28
People have been shit talking bitcoin since $15K lmao.
"good sign that we are close to the bottom"
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:18:12
So now you have to hold an extremely volatile asset over a year or two year span to break even or make money (given you bought on the way up)?
What a successful trade.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:35:11
Well, this didn’t happen.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:49:13


Not how I remember everyone acting. People screamed "FUD" and "HODL" and "buy the dip" all the way down from 20K.
I was told I would "be sorry" for not buying at 15K, 13K, 11K, 9K.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:23:33
Stating that you see higher lows, when we've been seeing the complete opposite, then stating that Apple (a revenue producing publicly traded company) and BTC are similar...
Ya you've just lost all credibility. Good luck from here, maybe someone else will entertain your nonsense.
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:18:20
You don't have to invest in BTC to have exposure to block-chain though.
But yes, I definitely agree about the "idiot" part.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:27:17
Why is 7k considered low?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:22:07
Such a stupid thread? We were at 20K in December, were at 7K now.
Have you ever heard of a dead cat bounce? Didn't we bounce from 15K, 12K, 10K 9K?
Lol jesus christ man.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:55:32
Ya because the recent crash isn't discouraging anyone.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:52:04
Bitcoins so cheap at...
Ya that logic works well.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:47:12
They were full of shit.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:14:21
Higher lows?
What on the 1 minute chart? Lmao.
God bless.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:41:24
Can't wait for that guy to eat his cock.
What year did he say he was going to do it?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:12:42
He has money in BTC, that's the motivation.
The "motivation" depends on where your capital is.
