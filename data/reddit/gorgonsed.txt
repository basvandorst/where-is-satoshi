I thought the estimate was at $0.7/BTC.
I haven't done any research myself though.
Ok just did a rough calculation for me, got $1.50/BTC at new difficulty.
Edit : This is on 2x 5830's in an older AMD64 build.

This question was already answered by the (supposed) owner of the website, right here on reddit, about a week ago.
Still your own call as to whether this looks legit or not.

Thanks for sharing, getting 313 out of my 5830's now!

Also assuming no electricity costs, no other initial hardware expenses or failure, no downtime whatsoever, no drop in price of bitcoin
The only thing 6990's really have going for them is their scarcity, as you would probably be able to resell a used one for higher than new price.

You didn't post any of that anywhere!


Does "a good" now imply research?


"compared to" now implies research?
I did some quick research and found a 6990 uses 470W under load, 11.28 kWh per day.  At $0.11/kWh, that is $1.24 per day in costs.  Also, a 6990 overclocked hashes at about 800Mh/s.  That is 0.53 BTC/day, which is $9 a day.  We end up at $7.75 a day in profit.  For a card that is $730 at the minimum.  94 days to make back your costs.  There's no way you are gonna convince me this is a good idea.

Very true.  Finding best parts for prices, figuring out cheap ghetto rigs to get everything working, etc.  About as much fun as the profits (which are getting meager :( )
@_date: 2011-06-16 16:27:23
I did a bit of math.
It's not perfect, but it's an okay estimate.
Here : 
I estimated this making $800 a day before ANY costs.
This does not seem to be a good idea.

Yeah a whole $10/day after buying one for $700+, how great is that?!
Assuming no difficulty increases you could make your money back in a little over two months!

I was accepted with : 
One IP address that I know accessed the account.
Previous password that was 15+ characters, alphanumeric and symbolic.
Current USD and BTC balance.

I would agree, but mining doesn't really push the card to full load.  It definitely loads the processing parts of the card, but the memory is barely doing anything.  Putting a huge processing overclock on the card and lowering the memory clock is very common among miners, and personally doing this my cards never get above around 65 Celsius.
Mining is definitely a strong load, but not a full load.

These are gonna be gone in a couple minutes lol.  Thanks for posting this, I picked up one.

Got in at $126.25, got out at $165.70. I'll take it.
