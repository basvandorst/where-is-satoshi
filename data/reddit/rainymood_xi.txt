I saw this tour of a dude's office, he bought his doorbell for 5 bitcoins about ... a couple of years ago, that doorbell is 'now worth 5000', wouldn't it be smarter to actually *not* spend the bitcoins, collect 5000 now, giving a higher 'utility value' if you'd state it that way?

For example, you invest 1000 in all three, only Google survives, where is the rest of your money now? It's gone. You have not won.

Makes you sound like an asshole. You just lost one prospective client right here (me)
