Its still bearish as it has been this time of year for the past 4 years. IMO, 9k is next...

I didn't fall victim or lose any money, my card just didn't go thru.

Chase bank customer support told me when I charged my card on cex.io they see the merchant charging chase was Coinbase. Strange huh? I think for US orders, cex.io now switched processing to coinbase, maybe to try to decrease their legal risks?
I am trying hard to avoid Coinbase as well. I have been quite unhappy with their support and service. Now I need to look for a new lowest fee place to buy coins with credit card.

Good gawd that bimbo - she has no clue what she's talking about. I hope I don't have to listen to her squeal for an hour!

I use credit card because ACH/wires take forever and I am impatient. The APR for the cash advance (29%+) is not what I have issues with. I can pay off the balance and not have to worry about that. It's Chase's 5% extra cash advance one-time fee on top of Cex's 3.5%, and on top of Cex's usually inflated Bitcoin price... that's probably over whopping 10% of fees just to buy some coin...

Wall street hedge funds are beginning to move into crypto. These big guys are not scams. May as well empower all the little guys to make more money before the big sharks take the pie. 
(will watch your video later. it's long.)

What is Bitcoin's long term solution to the increasing bulk of the chain? Will they have to hard fork every year or month from now on?
