The fundamental point is this: Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain and Litecoin is the second most secure. I hedge my bets on SHA256 with Scrypt and so do most Litecoin users. Failovers are key.

The author of the paper got his valuation model all wrong and missed fundamentals of the protocol: 
1. Bitcoin is valued on its intrinsic properties and value as a medium of exchange, fungible good, finite resource etc. It is not valued on how much it cost miners to solve blocks. It DOES have intrinsic value. 
2. Valuation is always going to have an element of subjectivity: which is more valuable, a cup of diamonds or a cup of water? Now answer that question when your thirsty in a desert. Apply that to cryptocurrencies when you are subjected to inflationary, legally binding currencies which cause repeated financial crises. 
3. 'If there is no earnings stream for a payment system role...the price should fall to zero'
Someone should kindly refer the author to something called miner fees, somewhat fundamental to the whole Bitcoin protocol.

The way tech works is things get easier and not harder for end users. The problems you're pointing out have solutions and they will be implemented eventually.

Transparency is a prerequisite and not an option...but the point is this: the project is pretty much dead on arrival, your team should spend more time understanding the fundamentals and build secondary services or revolutionize the paradigm entirely: in this space bitcoin is king...as time shall continue to reveal.

You would think it's great, it's how you propose to make money. I personally dont think locking funds up in a 2 of 2 is great but I do see a market for your service so kudos nonetheless. Bitcoin is better for the option.
But good analytics are cheaper and don't require explicit trust. As the bitcoin network gets stronger the statistical significance goes up and time to reach those thresholds goes down. Fraud should become more difficult to execute successfully, not easier.

I don't agree. If you issue a private key to different users and each of those users split their key using Shamir's secret then you have greater security against loss, theft or death of the individual. The private key can be reconstructed by holders of parts of the secret so that, if something happens to one (or every) holder of private keys the funds aren't lost.

At the point where the network is threatened we continue to see miners leave the pool to protect their investment. This economic reaction is rational and will continue until a better solution to mining is developed. I see nothing of major concern outside of perpetuated volatility of price as the 51% wall is hit.

They are different. Multisig is more powerful but some people put two locks on their doors for extra security and redundancy. In our business, that's what we do.

Let me rephrase a little bit because I do think GreenAddresses have an application, I just don't the utility is going to justify a successful business model as the service isn't worth paying for alone. 
1. The cost of double spends is sufficiently low that the largest payment processors charge 0% basic fees and still find room to make profit elsewhere so the cost is clearly low without waiting on transaction confirmations
2. 
The world is better for GreenAddresses but the risks are being overhyped.

Thanks. That sounds feasible for timestamping hashes of documents held elsewhere. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 19:41:01
I hadn't considered that. Very true, but at the same time, measuring coins lost would be impossible to accurately measure also. Blockchain charts do provide a useful measure, but it could definitely be more made a more insightful metric.

Unfortunately that's the wrong paradigm entirely. Why aren't people in the US and wider world able to eat the food which grows freely from the soil given light and water, two readily available resources? By right natural food should be the cheapest. Sorry to rain on your parade but I don't endorse chemical meal replacements and I especially don't endorse the pitch "Have more time to work away by drinking this homogenous concoction"
@_date: 2014-11-10 05:57:01
Definitely symbiotic. Litecoin miners earn more by mining on the Doge network and Dogecoin gets the security of a greatly increased hash rate.

They will never exist en masse, but free power and cheap hardware will. The market difficulty will find an equilibrium on the network reaches saturation point in adoption and solo mining will give the same return as pooled mining in the long run.  
There's a reason Bitcoin feels like a gold rush, it was modeled after one.

it's almost as if I was signed on to Reddit and knew that posting on Reddit would work. It's almost as if Blockchain.info should be aware of their charts functionality. It's almost as if I did this because I wanted to point it out on a public forum.

In practice there will be wallets which recognize both coloured coins and regular bitcoins, conveniently segments them with clear values highlighting their worth and realistically, only a jackass would accidentally transact with their coloured coins. If you aren't smart enough to not spend, store and otherwise protect your assets correctly you probably don't deserve them... Coloured coins are intrinsically superior to counterparty and the whole gang, Byrne just sees a system he can monetize more easily than he can coloured coins in counterparty. Also your physical world analogy is wrong... Because this isn't the physical world. And while I'm on this subject,  bitshares are still fundamentally flawed.

One would think all these smart people would get that this isn't about creating a new 'innovative' way to transfer virtual tokens around the world, it's about decentralized, robust networks driven by economic incentives, it's about creating defendable stores of value and most importantly, its about strong blockchains. Build on that or be marginalized.

HD multisig is an available, cost effective and elegant solution for exchanges that do their DUE DILIGENCE and work with capable developers.

There are workarounds to that problem. Expect client side multisig to be an industry standard in 2015.

Bitcoin escrow services are designed for these instances.

Bitcoin is primarily a token created to reward miners for maintaining the blockchain and therefore it will have value, providing the services using the blockchain have value. All of the BIP protocol features are likely going to be more useful on side-chained alt coins specifically designed for speed and high volume financial transactions. The blockchain provides timestamped proof of 3rd party data integrity in a more secure way than has even been possible. Is running an independent database stored on a private, public or perhaps another peer-to-peer network designed specifically for distributed data storage or high frequency transactions a problem? I don't see one. It's not the decentralized utopia people here wish for but it's realistic and highly functional application. 100% accountability by private and public companies to their users and with that huge competition to meet the raised expectations of the public. Let users or companies issue tokens, currency, credits, proof of intellectual property ownership or whatever else they like. Show me the hash, show me the data that arrives at that hash and it's blockchain height and if they correspond to other people's records then the blockchain is serving it's purpose of time-stamping data in a way that mandates no trust. In this context Bitcoin itself becomes a symbiotic experiment piggybacking on the blockchain.

Thanks for that insight. Pruning seems like a likely medium term measure for managing the size of the blockchain, however is there any analysis on the impact of Moore's Law as it relates to increases in processing power and the impact of that on hashing power of the network? IF pruning is necessary would it result in the loss of additional data added to the blockchain in the manner this thread suggests? Does the Foundation and bitcoin mining community have plans to preserve pruned data? How? centralized? 
Sorry if my questions are a bit much, you just seem to be more closely acquainted with the mechanics of bitcoin
