Yes, I tired all three tabs, including the Salt field of generic tab.
I just found out that it actually doesn't matter which tab is used. No matter if it's Username field in login info tab, or Name field in personal info, or Salt field in generic tab, the result is the same.
So I put "breath unknown stab reflection skills bounce tea long anywhere sweat depend excuse" in the Passphrase field, and "Jerry Seinfeld" in either salt field (without quote marks), the result is 1BookuirZ2XMSrtwXPDnJ5q5JYwmqHkPH3.

Good things happen in Bitcoin. It's inevitable. Is there a problem?


Bitcoin can lose price. It doesn't lose values unless it's fundamentally wrong/not working.

Bitcoin is in the market because it is not adopted by the mass. There will be market/price issues inevitably. Even USD as in the foreign exchange markets (not as a currency) has market/price issues. It is irrelevant to the question.

What did I say? I raised a question with a commonly acknowledged fact.
What did you say? Nothing directly addressing my question, but "You questioning my result? It's correct. It's based on data".
In addition, although your chart may (or may not) be correct, your conclusion is certainly wrong.
1. The best you can say is the volatility increased in 2017. The degree of increase isn't any bigger than precious years in general. The decrease in 2012 and the increase in 2013 are both more significant than 2017, according to your chart.
2. This is about your comment. You didn't take into account that Bitcoin had the biggest disturbances in 2017 in its history. UASF, SegWit2x soft-fork, Bcash, SegWit2x hard-fork, hashpower attacks due to Bcash, to name a few. It's well-acknowledged that we experienced the biggest attacks in 2017. And you brought up volatility is not good. It's like saying "The life quality decreased significantly between 1939 and 1945. It is really not good for the world." The timeframe is world war two. Of course the life quality decreased. It is not the main issue in that timeframe. Why make it so significant?
The conclusion you should have drawn from your chart and the facts should be that Bitcoin's volatility stayed stable in spite of the major attacks in 2017, and it is good.
Edit: errors.

1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the starting of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.

Running a node is the necessity if you intend to use Bitcoin in its supposed way - a peer-to-peer currency.
In any peer-to-peer system, you are supposed to run your own peer. In Bitcoin, a peer is a full node.
The benefits? You don't have to trust anyone. You becomes your own bank. If that's not a priority to you, you'd just stay with banks.
Helping the network is definitely a good thing, but it comes at a lower priority.

My belief that he might have contributed to the idea/design of Bitcoin, especially the blockchain, is based on the fact that he has many patents related to blockchain. I can't think of another better explanation but to believe blockchain is his thing, which means he may be the person conceived the idea. I may be wrong. But until there is evidence proving his patents are wrong or cons, I will hold this assumption.
In the meanwhile, as I said, I don't consider him as a part of Satoshi (team) even if he conceived the blockchain idea because he doesn't understand the purpose of Bitcoin.
What I imagine has likely happened is that Dave was working on the idea of Bitcoin, had some chats with Craig, Craig came up with the idea of blockchain or they worked together to form the idea, Dave finished the complete design of Bitcoin and coded it, Dave gave the private keys of Satoshi's coins to Craig before his suicide (because he valued Craig as being an important role in creating Bitcoin), and Craig tried to take full credit.

You already said "unlikely". You are talking about an extreme situation. In such a situation, you are at disadvantage, just like extreme minority in any social conditions. The thing is: there are Bitcoiners who are determined to protect Bitcoin from being maliciously changed. As a result, you won't be in such a minority status that you can't fight for yourself.


As a quick example, you, as a developer, can hard-fork and make yourself the only valid miner in your network and your non-mining node suddenly becomes a mining node.
Miners can change their rules however and whenever they want. It's just that the changed rules won't become Bitcoin. And you running your node help to make it sure.


You can't change Bitcoin by yourself. And that's the point. It's a consensus network. You have to have majority support to change Bitcoin in soft-forks, and "overwhelming majority" support to change Bitcoin in hard-forks.

The are many reasons.
Trezor is the original hardware wallet. The guy behind it  invented not only hardware wallet (as well as the software protocol of it), but also mining pools. The people in their companies contribute to the innovation and the development of Bitcoin itself.
Unlike Ledger, which is not fully open-sourced, Trezor is. No one has an idea what exactly goes on in Ledger. You choose to trust Ledger (and its company) if you use it.
Trezor's owner demonstrated their integrity multiple times in the attacks Bitcoin received in 2017. They showed they wouldn't trade principles for money. On the other hand, Ledger demonstrated they might be compromised by money.
The product not being open source alone is worrisome. The company being compromisable alone is worrisome. When both are true, the limit is your imagination.
Bitcoin is about trustlessness. It is about being your own bank. Do it accordingly.

No, it doesn't support two seeds. I thought you were looking for restore-by-seed.
If what you want is to move your coins in your second seed to the first, you don't need two seed active at the same time. Load seed 1, save the receiving address. Load seed 2, send all coins to the saved address. Done.
Alternatively, you can save the Master Public Key (xpub) of seed 1, and load it into a mobile/desktop wallet. It will be able to generate address*es* of seed 1 without exposing private keys. Many wallets can do it.
Either way can be achieved by using the link I provided.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:05:56
The link is what convinced me Ledger is technically not as good. Unlike what's in the article, the weaknesses of Trezor are either non-issues, or minor and shared with Ledger. However, showing only 8 characters of the address is a clear indication of the sense of security/insecurity of the makers of Ledger.
By the way, the purpose of the article was to shill a product in the relevant field that the author made. It's biased.

2. Alice1 transfers 0.1 BTC to Alice2. Outcome: Alice1: 0.9 BTC; Alice2: 1.1 BTC.
3. Alice1 transfers 0.5 BTC to Bob, who had 1 BTC. Outcome: Alice1: 0.4 BTC; Alice2: 1.1 BTC, Bob: 1.5 BTC.
4. Alice1 broadcasts the old status when she had 0.9 BTC.
Will the 0.5 BTC transferred to Bob be reversed and all 2 BTC of Alice ends up at Alice2?

Since you have gone into full dodging as well as child-arguing mode, I'll just randomly point out one (and one only, because that's enough to knock you over) of the questions you dodged in every reply to you, until you admit failure and fuck off.
**Why did Jihan stall the development of Bitcoin, losing 1000%+ profit?**
Oh, by the way, here is another lie of you: the number 20% is the energy Covert AsicBoost saves, the number of increased profit is 2000%. Another unbeatable argument for you but I'm sure you'll dodge. Thanks for refreshing my memory, by the way.

You get trustlessness, for the transactions related to yourself - BTC sent to you and BTC you send. And trustlessness is what peer-to-peer is about.
There is another less obvious benefit I didn't mention. It is that your node enforces the rules that you agree on to a degree that no one, including the powerful developers, can ignore you when they consider any change in Bitcoin. It represents your power.

I haven't read any papers other than Bitcoin's. I've been through the news about Ethereum DAO hack/hard-fork and learned how hypocritical/dodgy the people behind it are. I learned how easy it is to create a new coin by forking Bitcoin. I decided to stay in Bitcoin and tried to understand it as much as I can. The more I learned (and experienced), the more I realized Bitcoin is not about getting rich - it is a revolution of both financial systems and personal financial freedom. I didn't think any other coin has the same purpose. So I went from stage one to stage four directly.
The most time I spent in altcoins was when I was arguing against ETH DAO hard-fork and for ETC is the real Ethereum.
Edit: To clarify, I've never owned any altcoin, including ETC and ETH.

Why is Bitcoin useless as a currency? It is a better store of value which makes it a better currency from that view point.

1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the starting of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.
Bcash does not resolve any problem in Bitcoin. Every altcoin without many users has low fees, thus can be used for "daily use".

You are apparently an attacker of Bitcoin trying to destroy Bitcoin by centralizing it, which is by stopping people from running nodes. Let's be clear about that before we continue.


There in no guarantee that it will work under *any* circumstance. Nothing can work under *any* circumstance. Name one if you can.


With hard-forks, you can change the mining algorithm to whatever you like, making existing miners not being able to make blocks. Who says it SHA256 can't be changed (in a hard-fork)?


LOL. Angry because you foreseed being defeated?


What's currently Bitcoin, and consensus if a hard-fork is involved, define what's Bitcoin in the future. Exchanges don't have power. No one has the power because the power is distributed/decentralized. Again, that's the point. Your share the common opinions amongst Bitcoin's attackers. I wonder why? /s

Alice1 transfers 0.5 BTC to Bob, who had 1 BTC (Alice1: 0.4 BTC; Alice2: 1.1 BTC, Bob: 1.5 BTC). Now Alice1 broadcasts an old transaction/status when she had 0.9 BTC. What will happen?

I guess you are talking about Covert AsicBoost. AntBleed is more than a cheat without a question.
They somehow got the patent in China, while it had already been registered in western countries by other people. It's not possible even if the original inventor sells it to them. This is cheat 1.
They get the patent so that other mining hardware companies can't use the same technology. This is not "open decentralized network", as you mentioned. This is cheat 2.
Covert AsicBoost involves mining (near) empty blocks. In order to gain the advantage, it doesn't do its job. This is cheat 3.
Hiding the real reason against SegWit, attacking Core devs, stalling Bitcoin's development, and jeopardizing everyone's interest are cheat 4.
If it is not a cheat, why don't they do it openly, as Bitcoin is an "open decentralized network"?

Wallet and node can be separated. Your wallet can use your node for verifications. Electrum, Samurai and other wallets already do this.
Bitcoin Core includes a wallet for completion. Wallet isn't it's emphasis, therefore its development is not as active as some others.
As an ordinary user, node count does not change the merit that you run your own node. If you don't run your node, you are trusting someone else. Then there is no point using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:56:10


It will required the support of "overwhelming majority", which is the original wording of Satoshi. I personally think it will require the agreement of absolutely every single Bitcoin's user, but I won't argue at this stage.


Core definitely have no power in consensus rules changes. Even after the chaos miners and enemies of Bitcoin brought in 2017, some major Core devs, such as Greg, still insist soft-forks must be activated by miners. And that's just soft-forks. They have even less power in hard-forks.




There is Bitcoin and Bcash.


Bitcoin has never made any incompatible changes. Every old nodes prior to SegWit fully accepts SegWit transactions and blocks. The consensus rules enforced by those nodes define what Bitcoin is, and the current Bitcoin passes every test. Bcash is incompatible with the original Bitcoin protocol by getting every block of it rejected by the original Bitcoin nodes, therefore is not Bitcoin.

Near empty blocks *are* a valid method in Covert AsicBoost.

The code can be buggy. It has - someone managed to gain trillions maybe even more of BTC. It was allowed by the code/network.
Do I look like crying? Or is that you who is crying? Who is hopelessly trying to justify a known cheater who cheats in many ways?

I don't. I'm not in cryptocurrency/Bitcoin for speculation. Nor should most people. Speculation, no matter how skillfully done, is gambling. There is no difference when saying "if you don't gamble well, you need help".
Investment, on the other hand, is totally different.

I won't argue people do earn more. It doesn't prove I'm wrong. Most people lose.
On the other hand, you having more BTC than three months ago doesn't mean you can guarantee you'll always have as many BTC as 3 months ago.

Here are some of the sources:
Covert AsicBoost:
Profitability of Covert AsicBoost:
Acknowledgments of Jihan/Bitmain:
I failed to find some of the sources e.g., Greg's initial Reddit post of the discovery of Covert AsicBoost, Jihan's tweet about his intention of attacking UASF chain, which might have been deleted, and his chat with some Chinese Bitcoiners, saying unexpected damages would be done if the attack occurred, which implicated he'd use AntBleed.

1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the starting of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency. Everyone is supposed to run a peer, aka a node. If you don't use your node to verify transactions, you choose to trust a third party. In that case, why don't you just go back to trust banks?
Your node, even if not used by yourself, enforces the current rules of Bitcoin, which define what Bitcoin is. No one, including the powerful developers, can ignore your node. It stops Bitcoin from being hard-forked without your consent. That's how powerful you are in Bitcoin, but that's only possible when you run your own node.


This is wrong. The developers can change the rules, and users can follow the changed rules if they elect to. This is especially true when it comes to soft-forks.
The UASF in 2017 is a live example that users can change the rules.

How do government agencies break Tor?
I'm not fully knowledgeable on this topic, but here are my understandings.
As far as I know, FBI (or some other agency) runs many Tor exit nodes, which know where the traffic goes and the contents, if not encrypted. It's how they break Tor.
The reason for it to be feasible is that few people run Tor nodes. And that's because there is no incentive.
With LN nodes being able to collect fees, there will be the financial incentive to run LN nodes. It will defeat the same attack method used in Tor.

What what? I just defeated you logic of mining nodes being significant.
If miners attack Bitcoin network with their mining power, the algorithm will be changed. And that's protecting Bitcoin.
Why do you think mining algorithm can't be changed? Hmmm.
Yes. What are you smoking? (I'm not mad. I'm just copying you.)


Agreed. That's exactly my point.


The people, who run original node, decide what Bitcoin is. Why mention exchanges? They are not significant.
Why do you think exchanges are significant? Hmmm.
Or, more generally, why do you think centralized parties, e.g., miners and exchanges, are significant? Hmmm.


You refused because you realized couldn't win.
 &gt;You say my node has power, I say that if I were to make 1 million of my nodes I couldn't change Bitcoin ... go
Your nodes, even if there is only one, as long as it conform to the current rules, define Bitcoin, just like any other nodes. If the rules are changed, even if you have millions of them, it is not Bitcoin. Is it hard to perceive?
You are asking a rookie question about nodes, and you pretend you are running a node.
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:55:12
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency. Ideally every user runs his own peer/node. If that's impractical, at least every interest group, e.g., every family, every business, and so on, should run a node.
The current number of nodes is far from enough. Too many users are using SPV/light wallets. They choose to trust someone else, just like trusting banks, which defeats the purpose of Bitcoin. How many is enough? The more, the better.

@_date: 2018-01-12 03:19:44


It is impossible that a mining pool constantly attracts more neophyte miners than other pools.
In addition, Antpool has Bitmain's mining farm, which is likely the biggest precessionally run one on earth. The percentage of new miners should be lower than other pools, making empty blocks rate lower.
Unless you can provide solid numbers, your claim won't stand.


Covert AsicBoost depends on luck, too. You can't just want empty blocks. Only the empty blocks that meet the criteria will they be accepted.

I think I know what I misunderstood and I understand the routing of LN better now.
Please confirm if the followings are correct:
- Every channel consists two parties - not fewer, not more.
- A cheating can occur in a channel only. A penalty applies within the channel where the cheating is committed.
- Every LN user/node can have multiple channels, and the routing (for other people) goes across the channels of the same user/node, while his total BTC balance remains unchanged (assuming no fee is charged for routing).

Yes, I can qualify the statement because the count of users is far bigger than the count of nodes and we know lots of users use light wallets or used wallet providers' nodes.
When everyone, or at least every interest group runs a node, it can be sure it is enough. Any number below that is uncertain even if the system works.

He stated hard-forks require overwhelming majority.
This is why, according to Satoshi's vision, Bcash is not Bitcoin even if what's done in Bcash is Satoshi's vision. Even Satoshi himself can not justify Bcash because it doesn't have overwhelming support.
You may need to get more knowledge before you get into an argument with such strong narratives. But we both know what you are.


There is. It's the thing you are shilling for.


Wrong. If a hard-fork has consensus, it will still be Bitcoin. Bitcoin has hard-forked a few times, all were to fix severe bugs, which without a doubt had consensus.
Consensus rules are agreements. If you want to change some agreement, you have to get everyone to agree. This is a basic concept and is protected by law. Yes, attacking Bitcoin by stealing its name will get law suits.


Wrong again. Soft-forks require majority community support and at least 51% hashrate support to be viable. But in order to reduce potential messiness, Core usually set the threshold to 95%, which is the case in SegWit.


I only see arbitrary claims as well as ignorance from you. These are all basic knowledge of Bitcoin.

The miners who can't afford short-term losses will quit, making it profitable again for the remaining miners. New miners may join when it becomes profitable, resulting in lowered even zero profitability. Then the process will start over. In other words, it will end up in a dynamic balance, whales will stay, and small miners will come and go. That's how I envision it. But I certainly can be wrong.

Jihan is behind Convert AsicBoost and AntBleed. There is nothing he said that has any credit. End of the story.
**You** have dodged my point that Jihan a and Co gave up massive (way way more than 20% or 30%) profit to stall Bitcoin's development. Why did they do that?
Let me debunk a few other lies of you.
Jihan had Covert AsicBoost years ago, before Bitmain even became dominant in mining. Their (near) empty block rate was way higher than the number you provided. This is your lie 1. Most ASIC mining companies went out of business during the period Bitmain rose. One speculated Bitmain knew something they didn't know. This is to say that Bitmain did rise because of using Convert AsicBoost. This is your lie 2. The block rewards was 25 BTC while Bitmain was rising and transaction fees were negligible. You talked like they only just used Covert AsicBoost after SegWit and they lose profit for using Convert AsicBoost. That's your lie 3.
Let's see how you dodge those. Otherwise, accept your failure and fuck off, shill.

SegWit effectively increases the blocksize, therefore increases the number of transactions per block. If the number of newly occurred transactions per 10 minutes is larger than the number of legacy transactions per block (when there are only legacy transactions) but smaller than the number of SegWit transactions per block (when there are only SegWit transactions), SegWit blocks will help to clear mempool gradually, resulting in low fees eventually.
Edit: In fact, even if the number of new transactions is larger than the number of SegWit transactions per block, SegWit will still help to reduce the fees because with SegWit transactions, the number of the blocks of to-be-mined transactions doesn't increase as quickly.

Sorry, I didn't make it clear.

Since UASF happened before SegWit2x and Mandrik left blockchain.info because of SegWit2x, he must have been developing Samourai wallet when he was in blockchain.info.

It's not orphaned. It's rejected. Orphaned = valid. Rejected = invalid. The block in question is invalid.

Yes, there is. It's by getting everyone's agreement. That's the definition of consensus.

Who says that? You? Do you have the consensus?
With that being said, it's likely it will have to be changed, but likely is not certainly.
And you said "sometime" yourself.


Consensus can be changed when the agreement amongst all people changes. As long as some people disagree, no matter how minor they are, it is not changing the consensus, it is breaking the consensus.
Calling changing "upgrading" won't help in getting the consensus.


**Any small group of people, no matter if they are powerful, no matter how minor they are, are entitled to block any change.** That's what "consensus" mean. **Bitcoin can work, and has to work in such a consensus-based manner.**

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin.
What was Bcash when it was created?
In a nutshell,
1. Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.
2. This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced more miners than every other competitor and potential all of them combined in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?
Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. Bcash developers even failed to remove SegWit related code completely. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may including bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and  Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.
There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC (BCH) and BcashSV (BSV). Bcash (BcashABC) was 51% attacked by two pools and its blockchain history was modified. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.

AFAIK, Bcash allows as big as 8mb blocks at the moment. Of course they can increase the limit (with hard-forks) as they want since it's a fully centralized cryptocurrency. Even by doing so, it won't be always able to handle everyone's transactions no matter how big the limit is. Nothing can. But direct blocksize increase is dealing with exponential growth with linear growth.
In the meanwhile, their blocks are only at 10k level due to lack of users, rendering 8mb limit completely useless.

This is not entirely true. Do not simply change your node software because there is an "upgrade". You need to understand what the fork is about *and agree with it* to upgrade. If you don't understand or don't agree with it, do NOT change/"upgrade".
When in doubt, keep your old node running. Because the rules that are enforced by it are the ones you chose to support, and running it will keep any potential forks in check.

The audience of this sub includes / will include resourceful people who are capable of mining Bitcoin. The answer should not be a clear-cut no.
Decentralized mining is a key to Bitcoin's survival and health. People should be encouraged to mine if possible.
Just make it clear mining is an industrial effort and requires tons of research and investments.

The ordinary economy doesn't consist of hostile actors. Only those who are threatened by Bitcoin and altcoin scammers are hostile to Bitcoin. No regular users of Bitcoin have the intention to damage or destroy Bitcoin simply because it is not perfect.


I haven't been seeing a noble attack on Bitcoin for a while. You have one right there. I have to give you credit for being creative. In the meanwhile, we don't just let Bitcoin die.


Yeah, I'm not going to be dragged into arguments about that. No one can say off-chain solutions are specifically worse. Period.


It is not a cult. It is a technology. And it is a revolution. Some people hate it because it removes power from some people. One of the ways they attack Bitcoin is to belittle the enthusiasm of decentralization as "a cult".


Sure. /s


I hear this a lot from Ethereum supporters.


It already has a chain size problem, doesn't it? PayPal has much higher transaction throughput. Visa has much higher transaction throughput. Ethereum is not a decentralized system, just like PayPal/Visa. What's your point?


If you intend to mislead, try to hide obvious lies.
Ethereum is a scamcoin. It is centralized. It is technically inferior. PoS does not work. DAO hard-fork / "code is law" is a joke. Do not bring up Ethereium when discussing Bitcoin, especially not as a model. Instead, it can be a negative model for any decentralized cryptocurrency.

A simplest answer is that you can't get everyone on board. Hard forks require consensus. Some people have reasons not to accept a base blocksize increase. The result is Bitcoin stays where it is (on that matter). Those who want such a change can hard-fork and create an altcoin.

No, the current Bitcoin works perfectly. We will keep how we have done things in Bitcoin unchanged.
Let me put it this way. Changing "making protocol changes require consensus" requires consensus. If you can get everyone to agree on that, we will no longer need to get consensus to change the protocol.
Otherwise, it is not going to happen no matter what. Just because some people think Bitcoin is under attacks doesn't justify changing the rules without consensus.

1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature in Bitcoin that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the starting of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gives Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.

The changes 2x brings are irreversible. Even if the blocksize is later reduced back to 1x, the increased blockchain size during this period is permanent. Every node will suffer from such a change. The change is fundamental. It affects every user/node.
Not to mention 2x creates a precedence of doing things in a temporary and risky way.
Rootstock is an application on top of Bitcoin. If it's centralized, people will fall back to Bitcoin (layer 1), or use other layer 2 solution that's not centralized. The change is not on Bitcoin. It affects only the users using it.

I don't think so, but I'll give you the benefit of doubt.


Bcash is one-man's coin. This man is Jihan Wu. Bcash is created to preserve his cheating advantage in mining, Covert AsicBoost, which is unintendedly disabled by SegWit. (It's why they trash SegWit and attack Core devs.) No one else, including other miners, wants it. A few other people support it because of the financial interests related to it.




1. Moore's law doesn't apply to everything. For example, Moore's law states that computer performance increases 100% per year, but Nielsen's law of internet bandwidth states that high-end users' internet connection speed grows by 50% per year. That's 50% short every year. And only high-end users can afford it.
2. Moore's law isn't fast enough for Bitcoin adoption at this stage. Bitcoin's growth is a lot more than 100% per year.
3. More importantly, users should not be forced to upgrade their hardware. Most people can't afford to upgrade their computers every year.
4. Even more importantly, the network should work without requiring every user to upgrade their software frequently, while hard-forks require every user to upgrade.

The brief history of rBTC
A long time ago, there was only rBitcoin sub; rBTC was completely irrelevant to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. At some stage, some people, in the name of scaling, began a coordinated propaganda of promoting a blocksize increase hardfork and bashing a softfork solution named SegWit, which had been implemented in the protocol but was not yet activated, in rBitcoin. These people mainly fell into two groups, one being shills of Bitmain, the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world, the other being altcoiners, mainly Ethereum stakeholders. The first group promoted the blocksize increase hardfork instead of the activation of SegWit because SegWit unintendedly disabled Bitmain's secret cheat in mining (Covert AsicBoost), which helped make them the number one in the market. The second group wanted Ethereum to dethrone Bitcoin. There might be other Bitcoin haters, such as bankers and remittance companies, but their identities are hard to confirm. The second group and the rest promoted the blocksize increase hardfork because 1) SegWit fixed some fundamental development-stalling bugs in Bitcoin and freed Bitcoin to the extent that it might render their coins worthless; 2) hardforks were inherently risky even when not under attack, could be easily attacked, could easily result in chain splits, which would devastatingly damage Bitcoin's value and people's belief in it; 3) hardfork blocksize increases could easily lead to centralization, which would destroy Bitcoin. They together disguised themselves as "Bitcoiners with different opinions".
For a period of time, these people spammed rBitcoin with lies and misinformation, oftentimes in an aggressive way. The mods did their job and stopped them. When their operations got hard, their leader, Roger Ver, who was an early Bitcoin adopter but believed to have become a secret Ethereum stakeholder therefore a Bitcoin hater later, somehow gained the ownership of rBTC. His paid employees became mods of it. They marketed rBTC as a Bitcoin sub with free speech. They claimed rBitcoin was censored and theirs wasn't. They mainly censored the sub by hiding the posts/comments they didn't like with massive downvoting (a feature of Reddit), which would result in negative karma of the posters/commenters, which would subsequently enable a 1 post per 10 minutes limitation (another feature of Reddit), effectively stopping them from freely expressing themselves. They claimed they wouldn't/didn't remove posts/comments and they wouldn't/didn't ban "Bitcoiners with different opinions". The truth is, they did both. A lot. With these configurations, rBTC became the nest of them all.
Before Bcash fork, what rBTC sub did was pretending to talk about Bitcoin while spreading lies and misinformation, such that hardforks were safe/good, hardfork blocksize increases were safe/good, softforks were bad, SegWit was evil, Bitcoin development was controlled by Blockstream, only Blockstream wanted SegWit, Blockstream was controlled by bankers, rBitcoin was censored, and things like that.
Then an epic battle in the community happened. Users pushed SegWit to be activated via User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF). Bitmain created Bcash, which was basically Bitcoin with SegWit removed, to preserve their mining privilege. SegWit was activated. Bcash forked away at the same time. Bitmain moved non-trivial proportion of their resources to Bcash. But the company saw Bcash as not Bitcoin. With SegWit activated and Bitmain moving on, altcoiners and other haters lost their directions for a while. They eventually came up with a new plan, which was to sell Bcash as Bitcoin (both figuratively and literally) and the idea that there could be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols.
It's worth noting that there aren't many actual Bcash supporters in rBTC. They pretend to support it in order to undetermine Bitcoin.
Fun facts: Vitalik Buterin (founder and spearhead of Ethereum) is popular in rBTC. Jorge Stolfi (\u\jstolfi), a well-known Bitcoin hater who publicly filed reports to authority claiming Bitcoin (but not other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum!) a scam, is popular in rBTC.
Bonus facts: Besides rBTC, Roger Ver owns Bitcoin(dot)com website and is believed to own  Twitter handle. Bitcoin(dot)com sells Bcash as Bitcoin by making their wallet app create Bcash wallet by default and with no clear indication.  actively bashes Bitcoin, pushes Bcash, and blocks people (so that its followers cannot see its lies getting refuted). All of the three major Bitcoin resources are either known or believed to be purchased from other people. Purchasing subreddit is in violation of Reddit's Terms of Service.
TLDR: rBTC (as a Bitcoin-related sub) was created by a Bitcoin hater (an altcoiner); was filled with Bitcoin cheaters (miner's shills) and Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on); is filled with Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on). It is not a Bitcoin sub. It's an anti-Bitcoin sub.

Remember Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer system. You should verify your transactions with your own peer, which is your node, which is your Core (or another full node software). It's the main purpose you run a node. Helping the network is definitely a good thing to do, but it's of secondary priority.

Bcash is actually more fraudulent than iPhone Andy because
1. iPhone Andy phones need to be manufactured by the ripoff company while Bcash is mostly "manufactured" by Bitcoin developers.
2. The iPhone Andy company don't attack Apple while Bcash creator and proponents do attack Bitcoin and its developers.

I'll count all of them in, without arguing their technical competency. And my statement remains true: the majority of the technical community is against a direct blocksize increase. It's not just most Core devs who stand against 2x, the majority of surrounding devs have the same view.


I have. The answer is yes - now and in a foreseeable future.
Again, it's not even the point. The point is that it doesn't matter even if I, or another thousands of persons, support 2x. 2x (as well as all hard-forks) can be vetoed by minority, and there is a majority against it.

1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature in Bitcoin that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the starting of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gives Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency. In any peer-to-peer system, you are supposed to run your own peer. In Bitcoin, a peer is a full node.
There are light wallets available. Some of them do not have the functionality to use a full node you designate. By using such a wallet, you choose to trust someone else, which is against the purpose of Bitcoin (peer-to-peer), and you may get scammed, e.g., by using bitcoin.com wallet.

Every node is free to run any software. So, yes, they can select the blocksize they prefer. The problem is it won't work if other people don't agree.
For example, if you set your node's blocksize to 300kb, while everyone else's is 1mb, miners will mine 1mb blocks and your node will be stuck forever.
That's why Bitcoin is said to be a consensus network.

You should learn by yourself before jumping into arguments, especially when you are giving strong statements. But I'll do it this time.
There are two types are changes in consensus rules, aka, the protocol: soft-forks and hard-forks.
Soft-forks conform to original rules. They tighten them. They don't break the protocol. There are a lot of such changes in Bitcoin's history.
Hard-forks do not conform to original rules. They loosen them. They break the protocol. They have been a few hard-forks in Bitcoin's history. But all of them are fixing serious bugs that is **not** supposed by the protocol. There has been **zero** hard-forks that changed the consensus rules of Bitcoin.
The bottom line is: old unupgraded nodes, which represent the original Bitcoin, fully accept soft-fork changes and fully reject hard-fork changes. They agree with soft-fork changes because they don't break the original agreement, and disagree with hard-fork changes because they break the original agreement.
So to answer your question, yes, there have been a lot of changes in Bitcoin's protocol, but everyone has agreed. Since everyone agrees, we get to keep the name of Bitcoin.

It's not about trusting anyone. It's to debunk the myth so that the companies cannot attack Bitcoin. The point is: there is no such a problem as high fees. The "problem" is created and maintained by bad actors, including the companies. That's all this is about.
By the way, as a matter of fact, Bitcoin is already not a trustless system because mining is centralized. Although Bitcoin is able to resist miners attacks, we are trusting miners at the moment.

If Alice wants to send Bob some coins, she broadcasts the transaction to the network. It instantly reaches every node. Every node updates its plain old database, which we assume is instant, too.
Now if Charlie wants to send Alice some coins, the same process happens again. And it's guaranteed to happen after the last transaction is processed.
Because the internet is perfect, the ledgers on all nodes are synced, therefore the system works.
There is no need for a blockchain. There is no need for miners.
Edit: There may be cases that two transactions happen within one CPU cycle. The probability is very low. The model I use assumes it doesn't happen. Or, we have perfect/instant computers as well. It's much less a problem because the delay caused by internet is way bigger.
Edit: errors.

Ledger is not fully open source. No one knows what's going on in the Secure Element. Ledger company demonstrated they could be compromised by money in the SegWit2x chaos. Either fact makes Ledger less secure. And the combination of both? I won't say Ledger is less secure. I'd say Ledger is *not* secure. You can build a completely secure vault and make it completely insecure by giving the key to the terrorist. What's worse, it can be done without you knowing.

In Bitcoin, you are your own bank. You need a product you can trust to run your bank. (The reason I'm writing this is that another possibly more popular hardware wallet company, of which the name I won't mention, have demonstrated they could be compromised for money. And their products not being fully open source makes any potential shady operation hard to discover.)

ETH is at a much lower scale than Bitcoin. It's more centralized, making blocksize bigger. (It even thinks about including sharding. Think about that.) And its fiat price is much lower. Those are the reason their fees are low.
Bitcoin's high fees only occur occasionally. There are solid evidence it is spamming.

1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the starting of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.

There are SegWit wallet recommendation posts nearly every day. One of them is the daily post with thousands of upvotes. I wonder how you miss them. The daily post contains more information than I can provide. I suggest you read any of them.
Coinbase and alike are bad actors. Just because they help with the adoption doesn't justify their values. They are selfish power grabbers at best and hostile enemies at worse. Either way, they pose threats to Bitcoin. With them, we will experience difficulties in the process of getting where we want. Without them, we will get there more smoothly, albeit maybe a little more slowly (edit:) in some stages, which is totally fine.

Just some quick math:
Bitcoin's price increase about 1300% in the last 12 months. That's about 1.246x every month. In about 31 months, the price will be 914x, which is roughly 1 mil. That gives May 2020.

Bitcoin is not a business. It has its purpose - a decentralized currency. As long as it stays its course, it will be successful and valuable. If another technology comes into existence for the same purpose, it is great. People can choose between them. And may the better product win. I don't really care if it is Bitcoin that stands out, although I doubt it will be beaten.

@_date: 2017-12-02 05:00:48
Check my reasons here: 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:52:36
Three reasons:
1. Trezor is the inventor of hardware wallet. They set the standard, which is used by all hardware wallets as well as most software wallets. The creator also invented mining pool.
2. Trezor is fully open source. Ledger has a closed source component. You will never know what's going on in there. Even if the current batches of Ledger devices are not bugged, there is no guarantee it will be the same in the future.
3. The owner of Trezor/Slush demonstrated they would not trade principles for money in the UASF movement this year. They showed their integrity. On the other hand, the owner of Ledger demonstrated their shady stance when it comes to handling SegWit2x, an attack on Bitcoin.

I'll try to address question 1.
1. Hardware wallet's main advantage, private keys never leave the device, can become a curse in the case of coin splits when you want to claim the forked coins. Because you can't get the private keys, you can't claim forked coins by yourself. You rely completely on the manufacturer to implement the claiming. If they don't, or they are shut down, you'll have to use another hardware wallet that provides the functionality, or a software wallet that exposes the private keys for you to claim the coins yourself.
2. Hardware wallet has a single point of failure: the manufacturer. If they become greedy or are compromised, they can easily steal all your coins (and other people's).
3. Hardware wallet that uses closed source components, such as Ledger, may do things without you knowing, e.g., tracking you.

SegWit directly reduces *your* transaction fees, and you haven't switched? Maybe you don't care about transaction fees at all.


These companies are the ones pushing 2x, a hostile takeover attempt, by complaining about fees. No, they can't complain about the fees if they don't implement SegWit, just like miners don't get to complain blocksize issue if they mine empty blocked.
Moreover, SegWit is not only ready and also easy to implement.

The really is that Bitcoin is not truly decentralized. The mining is not. The exchanging of fiat and BTC is not.
The more importantly, nothing is resilient enough to survive by itself. Even fully decentralized systems can be easily shut down if the government has the power to go into every home and confiscate people's properties. The narrative that Bitcoin can and should suffer all attacks without getting help is an attack on Bitcoin.

This is wrong. You shouldn't be looking at absolute number. It should be the relative percentage.

I generally agree with the article except that miners have power. But I disagree with the analog.
Take some time to think about the following scenario. In a perfect internet that every network transition is instant, how can we build a decentralized system similar to Bitcoin? The answer is that the whole network can run a distributed ledger as if it's a centralized server. There is no need for miners. (From this aspect, the reason for introducing miners in Bitcoin is to resolve the imperfection of internet, *only*. The only job they do is to ensure there is a globally unified ledger.) Users/nodes literally decide everything.
Both devs and miners are workers serving users. Devs improve the protocol/software. Miners resolve the problem caused by the imperfection of internet. Neither have power. Users decide everything.
Edit: Both devs and miners have the power to decide trivial technical details.
Edit: Devs are high-profile legal experts we invite as volunteers. Miners are contractors we hire.
Edit: errors.

By any chance the technical community you work with and talk to is in the SegWit2x column of the tables in  I can't seem to find even one that explicitly supports 2x.


Direct blocksize increases can't resolve this problem. Spamming is sustainable as long as the spammer is a major miner. Not to mention there are enemies of Bitcoin with extremely deep pockets.
And that's not even the point. The point is it doesn't matter if I support direct blocksize increases.

Your main argument is Moore's law can sustain Bitcoin adoption. How does internet speed not being able to catch up not make a difference?
If this year your internet speed is just only fast enough to handle the blocksize and the next year the blocksize and the hard drive are both 200%, is 150% connection speed fast enough?

No, it won't, for multiple reasons.
1. Bcash is an altcoin. Just like any other altcoin, it naturally has low fees, because it has minimal users. Bitcoin, on the other hand, had users, and, not importantly, is a victim of spamming.
2. Even if everyone implemented SegWit, the spammer can still spam the blocks to increase the fees.
With that being said, if Bcash has enough users, it will have high fees, too; if some rich person is interested in spamming Bcash, it will have high fees, too.
With that being said, Lightning Network, which relies on SegWit, will make fees sufficiently low. I don't like to compare Bitcoin with Bcash because Bitcoin is a treasure and Bcash is a trash, but yes, it can beat Bcash in fees.
With all being said, I'll end the discussion since I've debunked all lies you have presented, which have been repeated uncountable times. You shills use the same training materials and never come up with noble points.

Let me tell ~~you~~ readers what's happening here.
You are one of the well-disguised Bitcoin haters who try to spread FUD to slow down Bitcoin (by shorting it). You saw that I debunked you and your other colleagues. You are not happy with me.
Now let me list the failures you have:
1. You failed to hide your intention (from me).
2. You failed to defeat me in your first attempt - when you called futures investing. It left you a problem you couldn't fix no matter how many lies you had to tell therefore you had to pretend the problem didn't exist.
3. Even if you end up having a big win over me, which is not gonna happen, you are going to be crashed by Bitcoin, like an ant trying to stop an elephant herd.
I didn't mention futures to prove a point. I mentioned it solely to mock you for knowing little about investing, and to mock you for not understanding what Bitcoin can do.
Lastly, even if you successfully predicted shorting Bitcoin at some point is a good choice, *you* provide no value, if not negative value.

I've talked to many shills who have the exactly same talking pattern as you. I've always given them the benefit of doubt. And they never disappointed me.
This is not political. This is war. And you are lucky I'm still civil.


I don't see how this is hard to process. The only explanation is that you don't want to look at any fact I have listed that's negative to Bcash. Take a look at Covert AsicBoost before we continue this conversation.
 &gt; running a fuller node is not an issue according to Moore's law?


You just ignored a big answer I've written for you (and, more importantly, other readers, to defeat your efforts).


Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency. It's supposed that every single user runs a node. Even the current Bitcoin network is far from it. That's why some Core devs propose making blocksize smaller.


Again, you ignored every fact I have listed that's negative to Bcash. What about the time before we reach that degree - the exponential growth phase faster than 100% per year?


High transaction fees only occur occasionally. There are solid evidence that it's spamming. And we know who gets the benefit from doing it.


You can, but you are trusting someone running the node for you. If you are OK to trust someone else, go back to banks/PayPal. Blockchain technology is extremely inefficient compared to centralized solutions such as banks/PayPal. It's a massive waste of resources.


SegWit isn't the cause of high fees. Most businesses haven't implemented SegWit. Is it milk to be blamed for it not to provide sufficient nutrition, if a person with malnutrition take milk?


No, there are many technologies in the line to help with this issue. Lightning Network is a major one. It has the capacity to bring Bitcoin to Visa level of transaction processing power, which requires tens even hundreds of GB blocksize if done in Bcash way. And LN is right at the corner. When do you think people can run GB blocksize nodes?

The main difference is BTC is the original Bitcoin and BCH is a hard-fork from Bitcoin.
1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, which is the main argument point by the attackers.
5. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
6. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gives Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.

Are the following understandings about SegWit correct?
1. Both regular/legacy SegWit and native SegWit have two forms: P2WPKH and P2WSH. Regular SegWit is either one nested in P2SH.
2. In order to calculate a regular/legacy SegWit address, its native SegWit address/script/etc must be calculated first.
In addition, is P2WSH used as much as or anywhere near as much as P2WPKH?
@_date: 2018-05-10 08:04:09
It is. Good software gets to people's hands automatically. A seller of the software provides no intrinsic value to it.
This doesn't even taking into account that Roger did it for his own benefits/profits, which makes the behavior completely noncontributory.

The main long-term cost in mining is the electricity and other ongoing costs.
Bitcoin mining doesn't use GPU. It uses ASIC.
The rise of the price of BTC and the belief that the trend will continue are what keep Bitcoin mining going.

Can the time (3 days) be changed? Is it possible to write the smart contract that opens the channel in a way that the two parties can decide how much time the other party has to broadcast the punishing transaction if one of them cheats?
Is a watchtower a specific and special node? Can it broadcast punishing transactions?
I have been wondering if all intermediate states can be broadcast and stored, while not activated, by nodes in the network rather than just on the two nodes, and the punishing can be done automatically by any node that detects the cheat. Is it possible?

If these values can be set by users, why don't we take a step forward and give users control over everything, including the rules themselves?

In software development, temporary solutions can become long-term even permanent. Only when there are suitable better solutions may the temporarily solution be replaced. It's still not guaranteed because there can be other factors in play. Just because something is temporary doesn't justify it to be removed or replaced. In Bitcoin's block size case, no better solution has occurred. In addition, temporary can be temporary temporary and totally OK temporary. Bitcoin's block size is totally OK temporary. So there is no need to abruptly change it, especially when the change (hard fork) involves massive risks.
They try various kinds of modifications. None is comparable to what Core developed.

Bitcoin is never designed to be a store of value and has never advanced towards that direction. It just naturally becomes a store of value because what it is and what it does.
Where did you get that number (1000)? Let me do some calculations. There are close to 100 Bitcoin exchanges in the world. So in average 10 persons per exchanges. Is it right? What about other services? Wallet software?

Blockstream does not control any forum. Unless you have an evidence?




These two are the same. Satoshi has worked on payment channel and Lightning. Blockstream can't operate without a direction and this is their direction, which makes perfect sense. How do they justify that Blockstream tries to control Bitcoin? The best you can say is that Blockstream tries to influence Bitcoin.


There is no guarantee that transaction fees will stay low. Actually because of Bitcoin's deflation nature, the transaction fees are destined to rise. And that's not even the point. Even if having high transaction fees is wrong, how does it justify that Blockstream tries to control Bitcoin? The best you can say is that Blockstream tries to ruin Bitcoin.

I suggest a list containing more words and the following sentence pattern:
Adjective Noun Verb Adjective Noun Adjective
(The last Adjective serves as an adverb.)
For example,
`tame brick kick happy bomb patient(ly)`
If we can use around 10000 words, two sentences will do (without the checksum). With more words, two sentences can contain the checksum.
Nouns can be as used as adjectives because they can be descriptive. There are lots of nouns. Names can be nouns, for example. There are so many names. Not only human names can also company/brand names can be used.
So an example address can be represented as:
`tame brick kick happy dam patient`
`adam cake sort bacon ibm full`
, which can be memorized as:
A tame brick kicks a happy dam patiently. Adam's cake sorts bacon-shaped IBM fully.

Just because it's open source software doesn't mean it'd work after any change. This is especially true for Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies), because unlike traditional software, Bitcoin requires consensus to work. Breaking any value is breaking the consensus, therefore it will not work. It's not because of any game theory that the values can not/hardly be changed. It's because they are part of the consensus. As a result, although possible (through any kind of consensus), changes to these values should be extremely hard, rather than extremely easy.

Miners have zero power in Bitcoin. They are workers. Don't you think in any system rulers being the only party who get money is overly absurd? If you really want to put the title of "rulers" on someone, it's the nodes.

Do you realize your talk about nodes has nothing to do with the topic OP started, or my points? Not to mention it doesn't make any sense.
No node has complained about the resources consumed and that they are not compensated. They are altruistic peer-to-peer contributors. The only complaint I've heard from nodes is about miners' selfish behaviors. Don't try to raise the hatred of nodes, because it's not going to work.

Could you elaborate (into details)?
@_date: 2017-02-05 22:25:55


This is not true.


No one treats nodes like they don't matter. Core are worried bigger block creates bigger burden to nodes. Nodes work like any peer-to-peer network participant by contributing to the network voluntarily. The reasons for this to work include 1) the resources consumed are limited; 2) altruism, which has been proven to exist and work since internet appeared. Core try to control the resource consumption so that 1) will be sustainable. This is Satoshi's design from the beginning. It worked and it will continue to work.


This is so wrong. No one secures the blockchain except miners. Everything else can be Sybil-attacked, including nodes. That's why proof-of-work comes into exist (and is brilliant) in the first place. Nodes are distributed bookkeepers. They make the system trustless because users don't have to rely on any authority. What nodes bring is trust.
@_date: 2017-02-25 14:00:15

I personally believe there are at least two enemies, one being the miners, the other being altcoin, most likely Ethereum, investors/speculators. The miners want big blocks and centralization. They don't care about soft or hard forking. The altcoin investors/speculators want everything that can help to ruin Bitcoin therefore they support big blocks and centralization. But they also firmly support hard-forking because they've seen how chaotic a hard-fork can be.

If China shuts down mining, only the western world will be mining. This means a drop of hashrate.

It's true that miners have the freedom to choose to include and exclude whichever transaction they like. But trying to exploit the freedom is not as designed. Instead, it's an attack. By design, it's assumed that most miners are benign. Miners being able to veto transactions is an illness of the system.

Yes, miners are introduced to secure the system. But that's under some conditions, one being that mining is not centralized to a degree that some miners can have the say, one being that most miners behave benignly. Now mining is centralized to that degree. For example, most mining hardware are produced by one company, which controls some big mining pools. Because they have the ability to hijack the system, they start to try to gain the control. They want Bitcoin to be modified so that they can have the most (short-term) benefits. That's how they becomes the enemy of Bitcoin.

Because hard forks are very risky. They require literally everyone to upgrade. Anyone who, for any reason, does not do it will be left on a separate (old) chain. If these people are the super minority, the chain will die soon, resulting losses of theirs. If the number is not minor, there will be two competing coins and the situation will be chaotic. Neither scenario is acceptable.
It's always preferable to use soft forks wherever possible.
The reason why you are asking the question is that you are misled by Bitcoin haters, most likely altcoiners, who pretend to be bitcoiners with different opinions. They operate in this sub, which is where true bitcoiners have conversations.

In other words, BU breaks the balance between different parties in Bitcoin network by giving miners too much power.
I suddenly understand why and other Bitcoin experts call miners the *employees* of Bitcoin: Bitcoin is a system to transact money, not one to create money. Miners are the only party in the system who work hard to secure the system and thus get paid. They are the only party in the system getting paid. They are actually hired to help the system. They are not the main entity of the system. Their earning money is not the purpose of the system but the means. "Employees" is quite a perfect analog for such "hired paid helpers".
With that understanding, it's clearer what BU is trying to achieve: They represents miners. They are trying to hijack Bitcoin so that it becomes a tool of creating money for miners. This is a complete betrayal of Bitcoin's purpose.

For an average of 500 bytes, does it mean the average transaction number per block is about 2000 (1,000,000/500)?
Does the average transaction size change over time? Why? I remember it was 2xx (260 maybe) last time I checked.
I suppose transactions related to multisig have bigger average transaction size. How much bigger?

I'm thinking there are two possibilities.
- The attack is from the miners. They want the control. They don't want to fork because anything forked from Bitcoin is an altcoin. They want the Bitcoin "franchise"/"trademark".
- The attack is from true enemies, who want to destroy Bitcoin. They know external attacks won't work because of Bitcoin's nature. It has to come from inside. As Zemo in *Avengers: Civil Wars* says: *An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumbles from within? That's dead... forever.*

I have been using KeePass for a while. I thought it was a good password manager until I saw some (non-Reddit) forum post discussing the code in it. If I remember correctly, it's a function comparing two binary arrays. It's said the code was so insecure that it looked exactly like textbook example of side channel attack. The OP and some repliers believed that the programmer of KeePass wasn't a security expert.
Then I checked KeePass official website. I found out that it wasn't using HTTPS. It means that the binary files downloaded from the website are not trustworthy. This totally destroyed my faith in KeePass. (I ended up downloading KeePassX to open my database file because the site was protected by HTTPS.)
Are you sure KeePass is a good password manager? What do you think about the code sample and the HTTPS issues?

My understanding is that BU doesn't work at all. BU's emergent consensus is consensus-as-a-goal, which is totally different from Bitcoin's consensus-as-a-rule. It has never been studied before. It requires many experiments (and failures), multiple times of overhauls, and another Satoshi to make it work, if it can be made to work after all.
@_date: 2017-02-25 09:07:29

Mycelium not accepting the seed confirms that Electrum standard seed isn't BIP39.
But the standard seed is accepted by Electrum as BIP39 seed.
There is no typo. I tried twice. Two seeds have been tried. Same result. Both were rejected by Mycelium and accepted by Electrum with BIP39 option ticked and BIP44 account number asked.
Electrum is the latest version. The seeds are newly created.

This is typical what a Bitcoin's hater wants to propagate.




Miners having zero power is a part of the design of Bitcoin. The "power" you see in soft fork activation such as SegWit is an inherent property of the consensus network, that only the majority can decide to change. The underlying idea is that it's always preferable that no big change is to be made, unless the majority agrees. In that sense, you can say that miners have the power to stop some protocol changes, which every party has, but the system always prefer no big change already. Without activation of SegWit or any other soft fork, we are good, and miners don't have power. More importantly, no change will be made to grant miners power.




Saying this reveals either how wrong your understanding of Bitcoin is, or how malicious you are to Bitcoin. You need either more study, or less lying. Every node is important. Nice try on the centralization propagation.

I've got a solution to remove pools for a while, but I've been hesitant to share it for many reasons, mainly because I'm not a master/expert of Bitcoin. The name of your solution "scheduled block" seems to suggest that it might be the same as (or overlapping with) mine. In addition, the most uncertain/questionable part of my solution is the P2P part, but the name of your solution seems to suggest that the P2P part should work (if our solutions are similar).
Anyway, I think it'd be better to leave it for an expert, which I suppose you are, to present the idea. I can add my thoughts afterwards.
Here's the commitment of a quick summary of my solution: 699ac4fca527654b6b06a5651c0e9a1280ae2259edd24962ebd825ab771b49a0. Admittedly a Reddit comment isn't a good place for commitments since it can be modified any time after submission, but I don't see another easy way.

Game theories are used to establish the system/rule of Bitcoin, including consensus. Consensus is an intrinsic rule. People don't change those values because they are a part of the system/rule.
In Bitcoin, game theories do not play any role after the system/rule is defined. BU thinks differently, as you've described.
Bitcoin is consensus-as-a-rule, which has been proven to work solidly. BU is consensus-as-a-goal, which is a completely different (quite the opposite) design philosophy and far from being proven to work, let alone other problems.

You can help to activate SegWit by stop talking about direct block size limit change.
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:46:28
BU and direct blocksize change are propagated by a whole bunch of rbtc staffs, not one person. UASF is proposed by one person, and discussed and welcomed by the community, not promoted by one person.
BU and direct blocksize change require a hard fork, which guarantees chaos. This fork, being a voluntary change by Bitcoin, will intensively harm Bitcoin. UASF does not cause a fork, unless the miners decide to do so. When it happens, it's not a decision of Bitcoin. It simply creates an altcoin. The damage will be much lower than a hard fork.
BU and direct blocksize change are from the enemy of Bitcoin. They created the problem. They created the war. UASF is from Bitcoin community. It tries to solve the problem and end the war.
UASF can also fix the issue of miners having power, which can be a long-lasting problem to Bitcoin's advancement.
Nice try, troll.


I believe this part is true. More and more truths are coming out from haters due to UASF. Same pattern here, using less important truths to increase the credibility of what's important.
Edit: The comment trashes both BU and hard-forks to make UASF look bad. So UASF &gt; hard-forks &gt; BU. It's because UASF will permanently make miners not usable as a weapon. The strategy is to live to fight another day.

What's the plan exactly? China bans Bitcoin? China forces their miners to fork? Where does the fork start? Prior to the first block including the information?

I'm not confused by anything. Bitcoin is determined by the Bitcoin client. It defines the rules.
There is only one Bitcoin client - the original one. It is the one not only because it's original, but also because it is the only one that stay the course and serve the purpose of initial Bitcoin client.
Miners are the least important party in the picture of Bitcoin. They are hired helpers. They don't define Bitcoin. If there is a way Bitcoin can run without miners, it would. The only reason for miners to have a place is there is no such a way (so far).

Miners have zero power in Bitcoin. They are paid workers. They work strictly under predefined rules. Some say miners are employees of Bitcoin. I agree and I'd like to take it a step forward. Miners are contractors of Bitcoin. They don't get any benefits other than paid wages. Their right for soft fork activation is courtesy and respect to them. If they don't behave, they will get fired. A lot of job seekers are available.
Don't be misled by the phenomenon that miners have control over soft fork activation. It is just a safe way to achieve consensus from miners, for improvements/developments of Bitcoin only, which is not a must if they are dangerous or harmful. We do **not** have to improve Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-04 08:19:46
I was going to say miners would start testing Core team, after seeing sudden surge of hashrate with SegWit support dropping. Here they go.
@_date: 2017-03-06 09:53:47
Wow, it **is** that simple.
I still don't understand how it can be Sybil resistant. For example, if an adversary has 100 physical nodes and create 10,000 nodes out of each node, he has 1 million "nodes". Can't they act in the p2p network as if they are real, and make the majority nodes that connect to them think that their chain is the genuine one and no SegWit-compatible blocks exist?
On a different matter, if this works, why is miner activated study forks introduced?
@_date: 2017-03-06 02:22:23
Does UASF has a central point, which is the link you provided?
BIP9 is a p2p solution, right?
@_date: 2017-03-31 03:07:55
A soft fork involves only consensus rule changes that tighten the rules.
A hard fork can involve consensus rule changes that either loosen the rules or completely change the rules.
As a result, if a node isn't upgraded to the post-fork version:
- if the fork is a soft fork, it will accept all the blocks from the upgraded nodes.
- if the fork is a hard fork, it may deny some blocks (and all the following blocks) from the upgraded nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:46:28
Does it require no miner support at all?

Here is what I'd say:
Bitcoin enables money transacting without the need of any third party, including banks, companies and individuals. You don't have to trust anyone to store or spend your money. You don't have to gain permission from anyone to use your money. And it only takes minutes to move thousands even millions dollars, even across country borders. This is how magic Bitcoin is.
Bitcoin is a threat to governments, central banks and commercial banks. But instead of banning or fighting against it, many of them study it, because they know they can neither kill it nor stop people from using it. This is how strong Bitcoin is.

BU's mechanism is totally different from Bitcoin and has never been studied, not to mention being experimented or tested. What is hard to understand about that?
@_date: 2017-03-04 03:41:37
That's wrong for many reasons.
1- Hash power is a statistical measurement of the odds that a miner can generate valid blocks. It by itself means nothing to the blockchain or Bitcoin. It's the generated blocks that are important.
2-  The generated blocks are validated/invalidated based on the defined rules that are enforced by nodes. The blocks have no power of any sort.
3- The way how the system gets updated, i.e., how soft-forks are activated, is not the core feature of Bitcoin. It is an auxillary utility. Just because miners happened to have some power there doesn't mean that they should, or it is how Bitcoin should work.
Bitcoin is consensus-rule-based. The rules include that miners behave strictly according to validation of blocks. This is Bitcoin. Anything else is an altcoin.

Is this a threat? 'cause it's not going to work. Without supports from developers, services and community, BU will not thrive.


Who care? It's a losing altcoin.


We won't. Even if the true Bitcoin dies and BU survives, BU will never be the dominant cryptocurrency, because it's highly centralized. Not to talk about there are already some promising altcoins, Bitcoin Core devs can easily rebuild Bitcoin from scratch and make it way better than the current version. They are literally the most experienced devs in cryptocurrency world. Their reputation will draw attentions of miners, software devs, services and exchanges. They will kick BU's ass.

I had the same question a while ago. Then I had a long chat with and finally understood why. (Thanks again by the way.)
You can read it starting from here:  Skip the OP because it's irrelevant.
In addition, I'd add a few points to the criteria of PoW listed in coinjaf's last comment:
1- The algorithm should be probability-based. This is to prevent positive feedback (the fastest computer wins and keeps winning), which destroys decentralization.
2- The algorithm must be secure. It must have been publicly studied by many experts so that there is no possible attacks (shortcuts). Otherwise, if a smart person finds a faster way, he/she may be able to mine every coin, beating other people's PoW and causing centralization.
I'm quite sure they are valid, but not 100% certain. Confirmations from masters/experts welcome.
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:25:33
The biggest problem is that Bitcoin is under attack by haters. The miners, driven by their greed, are misled and fooled by them, and try to gain control over Bitcoin. The civil war is hurting Bitcoin.
Besides that, there is nothing serious going on. The software and the network work pretty well. There are some issues and challenges, but the devs are fully aware and many solutions are being developed. Improvement's and updates are being created regularly.
@_date: 2017-03-11 07:04:55
Aggregated Mining. Key ideas: 1) PoW on the critical part of a piece of data provides close security to PoW on the full data; 2) Accumulated near-miss PoW can provide same level of security as regular PoW. Steps: 1) miners and nodes work on consensus of a universal block, excluding the coinbase transaction, to mine; 2) every miner mines the block with his/her own coinbase transaction and broadcasts near-misses; 3) big miners combine the near-misses and mine to finalize the block, achieving equivalent PoW.

Miners are the only party in Bitcoin that has financial benefits. Leaving them with even the slightest power will corrupt the system.

Then we can think about removing their power of choosing transactions.

First of all, they won't. So the question is irrelevant.
Secondly, Core devs are literally the most experienced and capable devs in cryptocurrency world. There is no argument there. It's them who bring Bitcoin to the current success. They haven't made any big mistakes. They have operated openly, conforming to the highest standard of open source ethics. They respect the community and let the community decide how Bitcoin evolve. They have earned the trust of the (true) Bitcoin community. As a result, whatever they have to say, the community will listen carefully.
Thirdly, there are lots of Core supporters who are capable cryptographers/programmers. They may not have the capability to produce the code that Core write, or come up with the solutions Core devise, but they are more than capable to make the right judgements about technical proposals. All proposals, including those from Core, have been and will always be evaluated by the community and Core themselves (Core consists of more than 100 members).

This is the lottery effect I'm talking about. (How is it commonly called by the way?) It directly increases the centralization.
My approach basically eliminates the effect. However, I AM worried it may not be sustainable with the overall hashrate rising - at the end each share embedded in the coinbase transactions will have to have huge PoW, making poolless mining not feasible. But there is also the growing of hardware to be considered. The growing of the block size may (or may not) be sufficient to the growing of overall hashrate. So it's unknown to me at the moment.




I thought your scenario was poolless, too, before asking the question. It appears that it is pooled. I'm confused now. Miners in the same pool should be mining on the same block automatically. The question should be invalid... No?


I've cut the post into sections. Feel free to point out which section is confusing to you.

For his personal issues? Are you suggesting you can arbitrarily tell what happened without any evidence? Who has the authority to say Bitcoin's is supposed to do this and not that? How is using the name a connection, especially when he is not even around?
There is nothing wrong to remember the inventors. It's wrong to say that we don't need to remember the inventors, or they are not important after they deliver their masterpieces. Without them, the inventions would be impossible. Without other contributors, the inventions would develop more slowly but they would exist. That's the difference.
If Satoshi makes a return, I will for sure see him as the rightful leader. And that in no way means I don't have respect or gratitude for other contributors.

There are pitfalls when spending from paper wallets. I'm not sure if the list is complete, but here it goes:
1- Some people think a paper wallet can receive changes. It can't. All changes go to the miner.
2- If a paper wallet is imported into an HD wallet app, it is not covered by the seed. The bitcoins in the address of the paper wallet will be lost if the device is lost and the paper is destroyed.

Here is what I personally believe: Roger, with or without his own overlord, has his own agenda. What he has been doing is misleading and using Chinese miners to sabotage Bitcoin's development. BU is a tool (illusion) he created to manipulate Chinese miners.
I don't buy the idea that BU is ChinaCoin/ChinaBU, unless there are some evidences. I think Roger is the root and Chinese miners are a tool.

They can discard the working nonce. But they are giving up the block and the reward. It will take a long time to find the next working nonce/block. The odds that another miner finds a block before he finds the second one is high.

UASF is just a way to activate SegWit, which has majority support and is blocked/rejected by miners for a long time. So it has nothing to do with being extreme. It's necessary.
On the other hand, Core sticks to Satoshi's vision. If you call that extreme, then being extreme is the right thing to do.

LOL. This is interesting. See what we have here:
1- It's a prove that Bitcoin haters exercise in this sub.
2- It's a prove that their ethics level is low.
3- The number of their accounts is not low.
Now look at the qualities of rbtc / BU advocates:
1- They operate in this sub.
2- Their ethics level is low.
3- The number of their accounts is high.
By comparing the two, it's safe to say that the probability of the two being the same group of people is high.
The conclusion so far is: **rbtc / BU advocates are likely Bitcoin haters.**
Now look at what they care about. It's the price of Bitcoin. And the post appears timely. Bitcoin's price just dropped no more than a few hours ago. So they are altcoin stake holders (most likely speculators).
Now the conclusion is: **rbtc / BU advocates are likely altcoin stake holders (most likely speculators).**
If combined with the reoccurring Ethereum promoting comments in this sub, the conclusion becomes: **rbtc / BU advocates are likely Ethereum stake holders (most likely speculators).** But I'm good with the altcoin stake holders conclusion at this stage.

ViaBTC specifically include the transactions you submit on their website in their blocks.
I see what you are talking about. Your idea may work after say 50 years (I didn't do the math), when transactions fees become the major income. But at the moment miners get most of their income from the block reward, which is given for the blocks mined (irrelevant to transactions).
As an example, some miners mine empty blocks.

What's your proposal when they start to hurt us?


1- Which miner is slaved or being asked to be slaved by Core?
2- How many percent of the true users have complained (I'm not even asking about them being slaved, because zero percent of the users has been slaved)?


Who is them? How much time do you think he spend attacking them?


Our biggest problem is that Bitcoin is under attack. End of the story.

Game theories are used to establish the working mechanism of Bitcoin. They are proven to be working. On the other hand, we can not rely on game theories to predict how people, including miners, will do things, because there is uncertainty. They may turn out to be working, which I doubt, but the experiment cannot be run on Bitcoin. Create an altcoin, prove it works, just like what Satoshi has done, then I can guarantee people will discuss about introducing it into Bitcoin.


With a limited block size, some miners are mining empty blocks. How would increasing block size help that?


There is no evidence that the fees are exponentially increasing.


No one says that fees are supposed to stay low. With the deflation nature of Bitcoin, they are supposed to rise. Just because you have something cheap at some point doesn't guarantee you can always have it. It is not Bitcoin's purpose to have low fees.
If you want low fees, activate SegWit and introduce Lightning, on which Satoshi himself has worked.


If you are talking about BU, it just doesn't work. It is at best an experiment worth trying out on an altcoin. Let alone it is a devised attack on Bitcoin.

Why is it not consistent? You find out one lie at the beginning. Then you become experienced in the patterns of the lies. Then you easily discover most, if not all, of them.
I can see Bitcoin is under attack. So forum moderation makes perfect sense.
For one thing, I'm technically capable enough to see that, at least, BU is far from working (if it can work after all). With this fact and the fact that some people push it like hell, it's easy to draw the conclusion that they want to destroy Bitcoin.

Your BTC will be fine in your hardware wallet. You'd better move your BTC from exchanges to your own wallet.
The fork will split your coins into two: BTC and BTU. Be careful when you move/spend either, because you may move/spend both. It's also known as replay attacks. Wait for devs to come up with a safe solution before doing it.

Doubling the block size isn't a sustainable solution. It's a temporary solution. Since SegWit already does that, there is no need of a direct block size change.
In addition, SegWit comes with many benefits and paves the way for second layer solution, which will potentially bring visa card level of scale. As a result, the need of block size increase will be greatly reduced.
And the last but not the least, SegWit is a soft fork, which is risk free, while a direct block size change is a hard fork, which is tremendously risky. It's safe to say that a hard-fork will, most likely, never be used as long as there is a soft-fork alternative.
The reason why you asked the question is that Bitcoin is under attack by people who want to destroy Bitcoin. They do this by misleading bitcoiners, disrupting and spliting the community, and jeopardizing the development/advancement of the technology, e.g., SegWit.

BU is nothing, because it simply doesn't work, but is made as if it is a big deal. It is devised by Bitcoin's enemy (altcoiners). Miners of Bitcoin, though being in Bitcoin's ecosystem, are fooled, by the outsiders who are in disguise, to believe it works and they can have ultimate control with it. On the other hand, Core and other true Bitcoin supporters can't let it happen because it will destroy Bitcoin. Thus the debate/war.

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin. In a nutshell,
1. Bcash is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash does not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It is an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, although Jihan Wu always refers to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, some people, including some influential ones such as Roger Ver, who is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago, propagate and sell Bcash as Bitcoin. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.

Step 1: Politicize debate. Drive contention in community by moving conversation away from science towards populist ideological agendas.
Step 2: Target central point of failures. Lobby pool operators, leverage cultural gap to misinform, stroke egos and offer illusion of power
Step 3: Highjack the brand. Create an incompatible implementation, obfuscate consensus mechanism &amp; advertise as “original vision”
Step 4: Escalate hostilities. Use astroturfers to further grow divide &amp; paint both side as evil.Reinforce notion that both are incompatible
Step 5: Force HF. Propose “market” resolution through coin split. Open door for external actors w/ no skin in game to disrupt incentives.
Step 6 (1) : Manipulate market. Dump original chain &amp; invite conservative hardliners to the same on the forked chain. Lay out the bait
Step 6 (2) : Invite hostile fiat incumbents to absorb dumps on forked chain &amp; use bag of money to drive fork price higher than original
Step 7: Cripple economic trust. Encourage market panic to drive price of original chain lower while fiat incumbents accumulate fork coins
Step 8: Use MSM stooges to claim “market has chosen”. Pump fork chain and sell to plebs the dystopian version of Bitcoin.
Step 9: Profit

The word "die" is an expression. It means becoming inactive / is minimal activity, unusable / of minimal usability, valueless / of minimal value, and so on. Just like we say there are many dead altcoins/shitcoins.
Bitcoin is not just the code. It's a consensus network based on the code, which establishes the rules, and the data, which records the ownerships of the coins generated. Reusing the code will only create an altcoin.
Bitcoin is the name that enemies of Bitcoin, including you, try to ruin. One of the ways is to say that the name is not important.

The major one is that BU changes Bitcoin's automatic consensus to manual consensus (in some expert's words), or Bitcoin's consensus-as-a-rule to consensus-as-a-goal (in my words).
Bitcoin is built with well-designed and well-tested consensus rules. These rules directly dictate whether a block is valid. BU uses some of the built-in rules, but some rules are defined by human actions, which brings uncertainty, therefore the validation of a block is delayed and uncertain, i.e., the consensus of whether a block is valid becomes a goal. This change is simply not Bitcoin.
Fairly and cautiously speaking, whether it works is unknown, because only experiments can tell. But with common sense, it doesn't work. I believe most, if not all, Core members don't think it works.
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:24:34
I had been worried until Charlie Lee, the CTO of Coinbase/GDAX, tweeted that, from technical point of view, BU will only be accepted as an altcoin and it applies to all exchanges.
The purpose of BU is to replace Bitcoin, for whatever reason, of which a major possibility being destroying Bitcoin. BU will very unlikely fork if it is received other than Bitcoin.
So BU will not fork.
The propaganda of other hard-forks have been rising recently. But they are less supported. Things might change, though.
Edit: The aforementioned BU fork is the UASF-based (soft) fork. Taking about the possibility that BU hard-forks away, I tend to think it is not likely to happen any time soon, although I can't be sure.
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:53:05
I believe shaolinfry meant it would lift the pressure out of behaving miners. UASF will definitely make power-seeking miners and desperate.

BU isn't a working solution. Why push it so hard, especially to replace a working solution? Why try to trash a team with great reputation and having done a great job to bring Bitcoin to the current status? There is only one explanation. The advocates are trying to destroy Bitcoin.
It is as simple as that.

A dev named shaolinfry proposed a soft fork activation method bypassing miners.
Jihan Wu, the owner of the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world and the leader of some miners, started to signal BU, talked about chain split and attacking Core chain, and implied owning more hash power.
Exchanges announced their stances, of which most support Core.
Signs that Jihan might own much more hash power than it was thought surfaced.

Any prove? This is critical, because all you are trying to do can be interpreted as to turn the non-malicious miners into malicious.


In the current situation, which mining is so centralized, which is wrong in the first place, I believe you if "major" refers to hash power.


The voting rights of miners are given to miners as a way of safely activating soft-forks, and the technology has been proven faulty in the past.
Soft fork activation by miners is not the job that miners are hired to do, which is to hash, i.e., to provide PoW. It is an auxiliary utility. Moreover, it's not even a utility for Bitcoin's functions. It's a utility for Bitcoin's technology development/advancement. So don't make it a big deal.
Miners are the only party in Bitcoin that has financial benefits. Giving miners even the slightest power will corrupt the system. It's a fault that miners are given the rights to activate soft-forks in the first place, and it's going to be rectified.


How can users hold you hostage?


This is the most ridiculous part of your comment and the main reason for my write-up. Miners are paid workers of Bitcoin. Although workers are important, they, in any scenario, are far from being backbones. Miners are no more than contractors or suppliers to Bitcoin. If they conform to the rules and do what they are supposed to do (to hash), the contract will stay effective. If not, the contract will be terminated. Lots of job seekers are out there.


The war has been on for years. And it's miners who started it. Don't pretend that it's the users who start the war.


Haven't you got paid (and rich)? If yes, Bitcoin doesn't owe you anything.

I remember being educated by killerstorm in my early days into Bitcoin.


That's really weird. I've never posted a single post or comment in rbtc, and I've never spent any time in it except the first few visits. I sensed something shady the first time I bumped into it. It's weird why there's the need for a second Bitcoin sub and they talked kind of shadily. I've never supported big blocker of any kind. And I've definitely never supported hard-forks.
I did ask about block size questions at the beginning, not knowing that it's a sensitive topic. You might be one of the answerers. I also talked about an idea of myself of dynamic block size or something, which I don't remember now. Not sure if that's the reason you think I'm have a tie with rbtc.
Hold on, the dynamic block size comment came with a judgement saying SegWit is hacky, which was, apparently (but I didn't know at that time), received from some rbtc shrill. I also said Satoshi wouldn't approve a hacky solution. Then I summoned nullc! That's the stupidest thing I've done in this sub. Maybe this is the reason? It does sound like I was one of them.
@_date: 2017-03-03 22:04:04
BU stands not only for the idea/solution, but also for the people behind it and their intention. BU tries to break not only SegWit, but also the healthiness and the development of Bitcoin. They are to be blamed. They are actually the main one to be blamed.

I think the biggest vulnerability of Bitcoin at the moment is the ownership of its name. If the name is owned by the devs, there wouldn't have been any debate. The modification of the license I'm taking about is not related to how the code can be used, modified or distributed. It's about the ownership of the software name.
The definition of free software may be outdated when it comes to distributed history-data-based consensus-based software. It's more for standalone software. The modification (addition) of the license may be necessary or at least greatly helpful for such software to survive.
About the centralization issue, it's the users' choice to follow the devs. When the devs start to behave corrupted, the users may switch to a forked version of the codebase (at the point before the corruption), which has a different name. I don't care about speculators. The investors' benefits may be damaged, but it's their decision to follow the devs in the first place, and store of value isn't the main purpose of cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin. The real-life use (the actually targeted users) won't be impacted by using a cryptocurrency of a different name with exactly the same essence.

I'm a learner, too. Here is my understanding:
Hiding basically means irreversibility. The hash is completely different from the original data and there is no (easy) way to find the original data with the hash. The original data is hidden/safe when the hash is exposed.
Puzzle-friendliness basically means unpredictability and randomness. Given any data there is no way to tell the value of the hash without actually calculating it, and it can be any value.

The reason why I'm thinking about it is that Bitcoin enables you to be your own bank. Banks require high grade security. As you have always advocated, running a node is more for your own good, than to help others. It's a price to pay for the security of your own bank.

@_date: 2019-03-02 23:01:34
The main reason for running a (full) node is so that you don't rely on any third party to be sure what's happening with your coins. It's the main purpose of Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer currency, and a full node is a peer in the network. It's safe to say that you are not using Bitcoin properly if you don't run a node (and route everything through it).
Another big reason is to protect the rules that you agree upon from malicious modifications, especially the ones that jeopardizes the decentralization of Bitcoin and the ones that aims at destroying the disinflational nature of Bitcoin.

51% attack with 51% hash power isn't the targeted problem of the approach. (It sounds like an unsolvable problem.)
I don't understand why it can be done costlessly. Could you explain?
The approach, from my understanding, can make 51% attack with less than 50% hash power impossible. (It's written in the "Pros" section.) But I'm not sure. I'd definitely like your opinion about that.
Edit: The nature of the accumulation of PoW basically removes the lottery effect. It's less likely that luck plays a role. It's no longer winner takes it all.  On the other hand, an adversary miner still has to use the shares generated by the majority of miners, who won't allow double spends. In a way the approach comes with transaction selection consensus feature.
Edit 2: *Even merely 10% can reverse a 1-block confirmation with a 20% chance of success.* How so? Is it simply math?

This is true. But it doesn't mean nodes provide security. Security is the ability to defend external attacks, of which nodes don't have a role. What nodes do is to ensure blockchain is normal. If you want a term for it, it would be healthiness/normality/validity, or something like that. But it's not security.
The purpose of nodes is to make sure the proof-of-work is not hosted on some arbitrary servers. So what nodes bring to Bitcoin is trust.

Isn't the agreement a 2MB hard-fork *after* SegWit?
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:19:59
Since you are 5, BU is a paper plane some other kid is making, while SegWit is a real plane made by professionals and ready for service.
Some miners are tricked to believe that the paper plane is done and working. When the fork happens, the miners who believe in BU will get on board of the paper plane. They will work in it, until it crashes.
Other miners, who might (or might not) be minority, will get on board of the real plane, and go from there. The plane may fly slowly and receive shots from the paper plane at the beginning. But with the professionals on board, the problems will be solved and the plane will continue to work.

Hard-forks are always bearish events. They can easily go wrong and new coins/chains can be created. There may even be legal issues. Always consider them very bearish. (There can be hard-forks with consensus. They are the best possible hard-forks and they are rare. Even those may be treated as being bearish, due to the possibility that things can go wrong.)

Some Bitcoin attackers operate in this sub and propagate various types of hard-forks (BU and 2MB mainly), in the hope to destroy Bitcoin. That's why you've heard about it.

Since you are 5, it is because a fixed blocksize change requires a hard-fork and any hard-fork is very dangerous by its nature and extremely dangerous under the current circumstances.
Why hard-fork for PoW change? It's because it's a defence against the attack. The hard-fork is still dangerous. But when it's in war, there are always losses. In addition, the hard-fork being a defensive method makes it less dangerous i.e., the consensus is quicker, easier and wider achievable.
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:18:29
Absolutely true.
Miners provide security to Bitcoin. Nothing more.

95% is not consensus. 100% is. Even one person says no, the hard-fork fails - a new coin is created.
Many people are not on the same page as you when it comes to ethics and legality. We don't attack other people's legal interests and rights.

I thought the days of propagating hard-forks and BU is gone when the idea of UASF is out. Apparently I was wrong.
"It's the last chance to propagate one of them. BU is too controversial. Let's just focus on 2MB hard-fork."
I guess that's it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:35:32
I agree. Only problem is that every hardfork change requires consensus. It takes time. Not sure if we have the time in the case of BU fork.

OK, let's talk about work.
The problem is that the puzzle is a part of the consensus rules. Since we are talking about consensus rule changes, we can change the puzzle. It doesn't have to be a hash, which has the property that the fastest computer cannot always win (it's odds-based winning). It doesn't have to secure, since there is only one miner. Any puzzle is possible. We can choose one that doesn't even involve integer computations, which is the only computations that Bitcoin does. Now you simply cannot compare the work. How do we decide which one is the most worked chain when we can't compare the work?

The keys of your BTU coins are the same as the ones of your BTC coins.
Your BTU coins are basically the same as your BTC coins. That's why an attack called replay attack exists. The attacker uses the signed transactions of yours, which use your keys, on one chain, either BTC or BTU, on the other chain and move/spend the coins, without you knowing.
Replay attack is one thing you should be aware of during a chain split. Don't move/spend your coins on either chain before the devs find a safe way.

1. Bcash is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash does not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It is an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, although Jihan Wu always refers to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, some people, including some influential ones such as Roger Ver, who owns bitcoin[dot]com and is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago, sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.

Bitcoin is created for users, not for businesses. Not even for miners. The interests of miners and businesses are not our concerns unless it jeopardizes the system.

Thanks for your input.


I see what you are saying: in my approach the candidate block is influenced by others.
I'm thinking that with more than 51% honest miners, the candidate block cannot be censored. The main goals are to reduce or eliminate transaction censorship and prevent double spends.


What do you mean, especially the "trustlessly" part? Like not on-chain? If yes, wouldn't miners still have to figure out a way to mine the same block?
It'd be great if the splitting of shares can be off-chain.


Unfortunately Lightning is beyond my knowledge at the moment. The scenario you described seems interesting, but I'm not capable to evaluate it.
As I'd expect, there should some cryptographic ways to do it simply and elegantly.
With that being said, do the other miners have to find out what block you are mining so as to contribute shares?


I'm more than happy to clarify any confusion for you. :)

Miners' job is to provide proof-of-work, i.e., to hash.
Soft fork activation by miners is not the reason that miners are introduced to Bitcoin. It's an auxiliary utility serving to help with safe soft forks, which has been proven faulty in the past. It doesn't contribute to the functioning of Bitcoin at all. All it helps is Bitcoin's development/advancement. Since it didn't work well and has led to massive centralization issue existing nowadays, it's reasonable to be replaced.
I suggest you spend some time to learn and understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin before going into arguments. The purpose of miners is very simple.
Edit: I wrote the above texts to answer the question in your title. The body of your post shows that you have zero knowledge about Bitcoin. To answer that, Bitcoin is designed to work in the current way and it can't work in the way that you described.

The answer is supply and demand. The supply of Bitcoin is limited. The action of buying it will inevitably drive its price up. The more they buy, the more expensive the price will be.
There are tricks that they can play to reduce the effect, but the trend cannot be neutralized.

~~SegWit is great, but I think it's luck that saved you... SegWit doesn't change the confirmation time.~~
Edit: I was wrong about SegWit not changing the confirmation time. It's true that the mining time isn't changed, but overall transaction confirmation time is shortened when the size of transactions in mempool is bigger than 1MB. It's so because SegWit increases the block size (from 1MB to ~4MB), which consequently increases the maximum number of transactions included in every block, which consequently makes transaction confirmation faster. 
Whether Binance (or any receiver) has enabled SegWit has no effect on whether they can receive coins in SegWit addresses. They always can.

Miners complete to solve the math problem and get the reward. Only one miner gets to earn the block reward and the transaction fees in the block. It doesn't matter if the winning miner is a solo miner or a pool.
Technically, there is a special transaction in every block called Coinbase transaction. It creates new BTC (the block reward) and sent it to an address that the miner choose.

And even if what you said is true, I still have to throw the dice a few times. Someone else, who plays the game slower than me, may finish the game before I get my preferred number.

I'm starting to get a little of your idea after rereading all your comments. Still need clarifications.
So you give out an address and some info that's not transactions related, and invite others to mine into the address. Again, do they work on the same block? Have you check the Solution (brief) section and the P2P part of the Solution (details) section? It explains how a common block (transactions and order) comes to agreement. It requires the support from the whole network, though. Not sure if it's suitable for your solution.
How do you invite other people to mine into your address? Wouldn't everyone want to invite rather than to join others?
I can't say with confidence but I'm thinking your idea about using Lightning channel to split the income may be compatible with / usable in mine.

Assuming one of the rules is that one of the fields has to be an integer that's smaller than 10.
Assuming in a soft fork, the rule is tightened to that the field has to be an integer that's smaller than 5. Now in all new blocks, the field always has values smaller than 5, therefore always satisfying the old rule (smaller than 10). That's why the new blocks are accepted by existing nodes.
Assuming in a hard fork, the rule is changed to that the field has to be smaller than 20, i.e., the rule is loosened. Now the field in some blocks may have values bigger than 10, causing existing nodes' rejection. If the rule is to have the field changed to a char type, or have the field removed, i.e., the rule is completely changed, then existing nodes will almost certainly reject the new blocks except very rare cases.

Nice write-up.
PoS is like PoW when it comes to the block order, aka, time. So PoS is a clock, too. And PoW is randomly choosing authority, too. Both utilize randomly chosen authorities to mint the clock. The difference is the selection criteria. PoS is inferior because its selection criteria is solely in-system, which will magnify any flaws in the system.

B2X/SegWit2x *was* dangerous, not only because it's inherently dangerous (hard forks are inherently dangerous), but also because it's an intended and organized attempt to undermine Bitcoin.
SegWit *is* an increase of block size. There are a few other soft forks that will effectively increase the block size as a side effect.
When the time comes for a hard fork to increase the block size, there will be consensus, because there will be no safer more proper alternative. Then the risk will be minimized.

Economics that rule bitcoin have changed and now incentives are for centralized hubs for "LN"

micro payments are not trustless
a distributed decentralized usable network that can scale faster while maintaining more decentralization than simply increasing the blocksize. 
For the cost of the LN node (rasp pi hdd setup) $300  you can get 16GB of HDD, and prune tx's after 500 confirmations to reduce block size could store several years of the chain if not decades. While a few servers/anyone that chooses to, maintain the entire unpruned ledger.
The LN is incentivized for centralization. it's cheaper to open 1 channel with 1 large hub than to open several to distribute the network, which means under some tax laws, these hubs can be considered money exchangers and be subject to regulation or could be shutdown by the government.

The brief history of rBTC
When there was only rBitcoin subreddit, some people, in the name of scaling, were promoting blocksize increase hardfork and bashing softfork solution SegWit in rBitcoin. These people mainly fell into two groups, one being shills of Bitmain, the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world, the other being altcoiners, mainly Ethereum stakeholders. The first group promoted blocksize increase hardfork to stop SegWit because SegWit unintendedly disabled Bitmain's cheat in mining (Covert AsicBoost), which made them the number one in the market. The second group wanted Ethereum to be the king of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin was in their way. There might be other Bitcoin haters, such as bankers, but their identities are hard to confirm. The second group and the rest promoted blocksize increase hardfork because 1) hardforks were inherently risky and could be easily attacked; 2) SegWit fixed some fundamental development-stalling bugs in Bitcoin. All these people disguised themselves as "Bitcoiners with different opinions".
For a period of time, these people spammed rBitcoin. They did it with lies and misinformations. The mods did their job and stopped them. When their operations got hard, Roger Ver, who was an early Bitcoin adopter (bitcoin dot com owner) but believed to have become a secret Ethereum stakeholder thus Bitcoin hater later, created rBTC sub in the name of free speech. They claimed rBitcoin was censored and theirs wasn't. However, although they didn't delete the posts they didn't like, they used downvoting to hide them. They claimed rBitcoin banned "Bitcoiners with different opinions" and they didn't, but they actually did. With these configurations, rBTC became the nest of them all.
Before Bcash fork, rBTC sub pretended to talk about Bitcoin while spreading lies and misinformations, such as that Bitcoin development is controlled by evil Blockstream and Blockstream wanted SegWit.
Then an epic battle in the community happened. SegWit was activated. Bcash forked at the same time. Bitmain moved lots of their resources to Bcash. But the company saw Bcash as not Bitcoin. With SegWit activated and Bitmain moving on, altcoiners and other haters lost their focus for a while. They eventually came up with a new plan, which was to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, both figuratively and literally, and the idea that there could be many Bitcoin. This is mainly what they do now.
It's worth noting that there aren't many Bcash supporters in rBTC. They pretend to support it in order to undetermine Bitcoin.
TLDR: rBTC was created by a Bitcoin hater (altcoiner); was filled with Bitcoin cheaters (miner's shills) and Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on); is filled with Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on).

You are safe unless you try to do the malicious update manually.
To prevent this phishing attack, all trustworthyElectrum servers now prevent older versions from connecting to them.
Unfortunately, newer versions of Electrum are not available in Debian and cannot be integrated easily in Tails. Given the lack of maintenance of Electrum in Debian, we are still assessing what is best to do in Tails.

1. The point that only economically active nodes matter isn't completely correct. Any node helps with enforcing the existing rules, which protects Bitcoin from illegal activities, including potential malicious changes of consensus rules, which is critical.

The reason why you must be online (at this stage) is because only by doing so can you send/receive transactions to/from each other (at this stage).

How fast a transaction is confirmed depends on a few factors:
1. Does the miner include your transaction in their next block(s)?
2. How much time does it take for the next block(s) to be mined?
The first factor depends on ~~two~~three factors:
1. How many transactions are there already in the mempool?
2. How high your fee is set in the transaction compared to others'?
3. Edit: How big the block size is?
If there aren't many transactions in the mempool, your transaction is likely to be included in the next block. Otherwise, 1) if your fees are higher than most, your transaction is likely to be included in the next block; 2) if not, your transaction will not be included in the next block. When your transaction will be included depends on your fee per byte ratio and other transactions' fee per byte ratio. The higher ones get included first. Edit: The bigger the block is, the more likely your transaction is included.
Now if your transaction is included in the next block to mine, when it gets confirmed depends on how fast the next block is mined, which is random. It's supposed to be around 10 minutes, but it can be between a few seconds to a few hours. It's all about luck. There is also the factor that how much hash power has increased since the last mining difficulty adjustment, which happens roughly every two weeks, but we can leave it there for now.
Edit: Typo and grammar.
Edit 2: Importing private keys doesn't involve mining. It's local and instant.
Edit 3: I was wrong about SegWit not changing the confirmation time. It's true that the mining time isn't changed, but overall transaction confirmation time is shortened when the size of transactions in mempool is bigger than 1MB. It's so because SegWit increases the block size (from 1MB to ~4MB), which consequently increases the maximum number of transactions included in every block, which consequently makes transaction confirmation faster.

I'm not aware of any paper wallet that's not web based, but I guess I'm not utterly informed.


Paper wallet's design make it easy for general users to make mistakes. In many ways. This makes it insecure.


There are security risks that are inherent with paper wallet, such as that it requires printing and lots of printers are insecure. This makes the format insecure.


This is a in fact an invalid point. Only by exposing the seed or the master private key will all addresses be compromised. Normal use only accesses individual keys. A secure wallet should be able to reduce the time when the seed or the master private key exist in the memory to the minimum. On the other hand, with paper wallet, the (only) address is all the future addresses. Wherever you are dealing with the private key, you are dealing with the master private key in the term of HD wallet. You lose all your coins by losing one private key. HD wallet doesn't add more risks. It actually reduces some.


This may be true for most hardware wallet makers, but I don't think Trezor does this. As far as I can tell, they are honest.
It's an fact that paper wallet is insecure. Just because it's some people's propaganda doesn't mean the truth should not to told. Not using paper wallet doesn't necessarily mean you have to use a hardware wallet. An offline computer with a secure wallet can do the same job, especially for the job that paper wallet is designed to do - long-term holding.


This is definitely right. In the meanwhile, we should also understand that most people, especially the new comers, who get into Bitcoin are not tech-savvy, not to mention security-savvy/cryptography-savvy (this includes myself), and that there are so many and so hard in Bitcoin to learn. Just because something is right for you doesn't mean it's right for them.

And who brags about manipulating Bitcoin price?
@_date: 2017-03-06 00:50:01
OK, I seem to have grabbed the idea. Let me rephrase.
In transactions from end users, they can specify that the transactions are valid only if a recent non-secret block is on the blockchain. When everyone does this, the secret chain can not include any end users' transactions after a few initial blocks. It means that after a few blocks, the attacker won't receive any block rewards, if there is no block subsidy, therefore the double-spend 51% attack will likely not be profitable enough to sustain to attack.
Is the understanding correct?
If yes, I've got some further questions:
1- Do end users have to specify the identity/ID/hash clearly, rather than saying things like "the second last block", because "the second last block" works on the secret chain, too?
2- If the secret chain manages to beat the genuine chain and is made public, end users will see the secret chain as the genuine chain. They will build transactions on it. Once that happens, the attacker's attempt of double spend succeeds, and his profitability of hash power rent depends on how many blocks it takes for the secret chain to win. Right?
3- If all wallet software include a check and warn users about recent chain switch/takeover, and users build transactions on blocks before the split, will it help to counter the attack?
4- How can it be done in a soft fork?

For the modified version, if the attacker knows your way, it's exactly the same amount of wok to crack your secret - instead of adding a word to one of the 24 positions, he replaces one of the 24 words. The only benefit of this method is that the attacker doesn't know your way. However, I'd imagine that there is a high chance a determined attacker will try this way (after he finds out that the 24 words don't work) because it's quite intuitive.

Are you saying general-purpose computers are not desirable for mining because they are (more) vulnerable to all kinds of cyber threats that are devised to control them? I can't say I agree with it because it's pretty much the same as "because people are dumb they shouldn't have the right to do ...", or things like that. Isn't the idea of Bitcoin that everyone can join and contribute to the network and make it so that no authority/party/entity is to be trusted?

Is there a difference between more repetitions of a simple fast algorithm and less repetitions of a complicated slow one?

Hash power is the security against external (and external only) attacks. There are two aspects when it comes to its relationship with the value of the currency.
1. When the security is sufficient, higher security doesn't bring higher value. Imagine you try to protect a herd of 100 sheep against a wolf pack of 5. The security provided by a few well-trained and well-supplied farmers are not different from a professional army of 1000 soldiers with automatic artillery. In fact, no one will hire the army to do the job. With the possibility of PoW algorithm changes, attacks are not likely. Any Bitcoin chain with non-trivial hash power can be considered secure enough.
2. When the security is not sufficient, higher security comes with higher value, and vice versa. Hash power doesn't protect the currency from internal attacks - the attacks from the hash power itself, which is possible when it's centralized. In other words, when hash power is centralized, the higher the hash power is, the lower the security is, thus the lower the value it has, if the threshold is passed.

As a quick argument, changes made to INITIAL_BLOCK_REWARD can only cause changes of outcome numbers, which are the end result. It doesn't have any big impact on the software system. On the other hand, things like MAX_BLOCK_SIZE are related to working mechanism. Changes made to MAX_BLOCK_SIZE will cause changes of software behaviors, including possibility of failure (to some extent). In other words, INITIAL_BLOCK_REWARD is a parameter solely about the economy, MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is a parameter related to how the system functions. They can't be treated the same way.

Softforks can be done only when consensus rules are strengthened, not loosed or changed. For example, consider a rule saying some field must be an integer less than 10. Now if the new rule says the field must be an integer less than 5, it can be done via a softfork; if the new rule says the field must be an integer less than 20 or it must be a floating point number of some sort, it can be done only via a hardfork.

Hard forks require consensus. Only if everyone agrees can a hard fork be carried out without the chain being split. 80%+ isn't enough. Lots of people *were* against the hard fork, the 2x part of SegWit. There *was* disagreement between miners and devs. All devs that I was aware of were against the hard fork. Even miners had disagreements. This even included some Chinese miners. With that being said, miners and devs don't control Bitcoin protocol. The users do. Lots of the users *were* against the hard fork.


This is true. But if there is no alternative, and the blocks are really overloaded, there will be consensus. People will want to do the hard fork. Even in that case, a long preparation to get as many people as possible to co-operate during upgradation is necessary. And we'll still expect some nodes to get forked off the main chain, not because the owners don't agree with the hard fork, but because they are not aware of /following the development.


Everyone is entitled to their vote, but hard forks require consensus. In fact, everyone is entitled to fork the source and even the blockchain, but you can't fork and claim your modified version is Bitcoin when others want the unchanged/original protocol.


Once again, devs didn't and don't control Bitcoin protocol changes. The users did and do.

OK, let me revise my statement, by adding a limitation.

Point is that the source code of them may be safe, as you pointed out, but the built executables may be compromised, as shown in TrueCrypt's incident.
This is a single point of failure. One compromised version, you lose everything, no matter how well and securely it has worked. Because Bitcoin itself is developing and the software keep being updated, there can be many chances of such a risk.
That's why I'm asking about whether people build their Bitcoin wallet software, and if there is any trustworthy scripting/interpreted language based wallet software because you can be sure it's safe when the source code is clean.

@_date: 2017-01-04 01:05:44


Please allow me to first clarify what this means. May I say it means any non-ASIC mining (mainly CPU/GPU mining) that either can't be made ASIC or doesn't make a big difference (advantage) when made ASIC?


There are two things here.
First, all altcoins are in super-early, super-uncertain and super-speculative stage. (Same adjectives apply to Bitcoin, too, but not with "super".) Miners' jumping boats being common at this stage doesn't necessarily mean the same thing will happen in their more stable/mature stage, as Bitcoin is in now. When miners have faith in a coin, they will more likely stick with it. If CPU/GPU mining of Bitcoin can provide profit, I really doubt many miners will jump off Bitcoin mining boat.
Second, the reason why people jump boats in altcoin mining may simply because they can't mine Bitcoin with their CPU/GPU. If CPU/GPU mining of Bitcoin can provide profit, I believe lots of these boat-jumping miners will stick to Bitcoin.
In short, I think people jump boats because there is no profitable trustworthy coin to be mined at the moment. When there is one, the behavior may likely stop or at least largely decrease.


Can we do this in Bitcoin? As I've heard, only a few companies have made Bitcoin ASIC mining hardware in the history and most of them have gone off business. The other thing is, as I've leaned, unlike designing chips, which a lot of companies can do, turning silicon into chips is a highly monopoly technology that only very few companies can do.


What if the PoW consists of multiple tasks using all common computing parts in general-purpose computers, such as tasks that are CPU-intensive, GPU-intensive, memory-intensive, HDD-intensive, integer-calculation-intensive, floating-point-calculation-intensive, and so on, and all being non-parallizeable?


This is actually my point. Bitcoin is deferent from altcoins. The boat-jumping problem in altcoin CPU/GPU mining may not exist in Bitcoin, if Bitcoin allows profitable CPU/GPU mining.
(I was discussing Cryptocurrency in general in the original post. But I'm more in the route of understanding Bitcoin now.)


This is actually true in a lot of things. I totally believe/agree something as complicated as Bitcoin can have such a property.
May I say that you pro ASIC mining, at least in Bitcoin? Do you not think ASIC mining causes mining centralization?
@_date: 2017-01-19 23:50:33
The idea that Bitcoin needs to be backed by something tangible is faulty. Shells were not backed by anything tangible and they worked in ancient times.

@_date: 2017-01-16 13:25:54


I've also read your other comments. But this part might be the root of the disagreements. Bitcoin is not just a P2P network, it's a P2P consensus network. It replies on consensus to work. Changing what's initially agree on isn't evolving, it's creating a different universe. It's exactly creating an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-30 05:36:13
I'm not overcomplicating it. I'm simplifying it. It's simple: you don't kill a hen for its eggs.
Buying massive amount of bitcoins and expecting to profit from it is speculation, if not gambling. It is not investing. Even if it is the investors' strong belief that bitcoin's value will increase (thus justifying it as an investment), there is a huge difference between investing in and profiting from technologies and investing in and profiting from trading. These are completely different types of people with different  knowledge and different visions.

We won't. There are other techniques to further increase the blocksize without a hard-fork, which is risky as well as harming decentralization. Until everything safe is tried out and the blocks are still full, no hard-fork will be needed.

If the checksum is invalid, the seed words are simply wrong.
@_date: 2019-03-30 06:14:10
Some abbreviations first:
TX: transaction
TXO: transaction output
UTXO: unspent transaction output
BTCs don't exist in addresses. They exist in the form of UTXO.
To understand UTXO, you need to understand TXO first. A TXO is a part of an existing transaction. Every TX has an ID, and every TXO has an index (based on the TX ID). With a TX ID and an output index, you can locate a specific TXO, if it exists. In other words, a TXO can be identified with a TX ID and an output index. If a TXO is used as an input (in the form of ID and index) of a later transaction, it's spent. A TXO that is not used as an input of any later transaction is a UTXO. Only a UTXO can be used as an input at the time of spending. Once a UTXO is used as an input, it's no longer a UTXO and therefore cannot be used as an input again. In other words, it cannot be spent again. This is how UTXO works and how BTCs are stored and spent.
To answer your question about double-spending, since only UTXOs can be spent, you are talking about a scenario where you broadcast multiple transactions spending the same UTXO(s). Which transaction is to be accepted depends on the miner. Different miners may have different policies, but the followings are the most likely scenarios: 1) If the transactions are identical in other aspects except the receiving address(es), namely the size of the transactions are the same and the miner fees are the same, most likely the miner will accept the first transaction that they receive and reject the later ones. 2) If the sizes or the fees are different, most likely they will accept the one with highest fee per byte ratio and reject other ones.

If it's attacked, a PoW change consensus will be achieved without any difficulty. Although it's a hard-fork, since everyone agrees, the new rule will still be Bitcoin.

Is there an estimation that how much lower can the mining fee of a SegWit transaction be compared to an regular one?
Here is my understanding: since we are far from full SegWit blocks, the size of witness data, no matter how big it is, doesn't matter. A transaction with 1KB witness data should be the same as a transaction with 1MB witness data (assuming no other transaction does the same crazy thing). The only thing matters is the size of the non-witness data.
If, for example, non-witness data in average occupy 1/4 of total space, can the mining fee for a SegWit transaction be 1/4 of a regular one?
@_date: 2019-11-27 23:58:39
First of all, you are talking about addresses, or the keys that give you access to them. Hardware/software wallets are just the tools to manage the keys/addresses.


Where is your coins? More importantly, who holds the keys? If you have the keys, you can do whatever you want. If you don't, including if you haven't bought the coins, it depends on the person/business who holds them.


Bitcoin addresses don't need to be registered. And they can be generated online.


If the wallet is implemented properly, the chance is astronomically lower than the chance that you are Bill Gates.

The brief history of rBTC
When there was only rBitcoin subreddit, some people, in the name of scaling, were promoting blocksize increase hardfork and bashing softfork solution SegWit in rBitcoin. These people mainly fell into two groups, one being shills of Bitmain, the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world, the other being altcoiners, mainly Ethereum stakeholders. The first group promoted blocksize increase hardfork to stop SegWit because SegWit unintendedly disabled Bitmain's cheat in mining (Covert AsicBoost), which made them the number one in the market. The second group wanted Ethereum to be the king of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin was in their way. There might be other Bitcoin haters, such as bankers, but their identities are hard to confirm. The second group and the rest promoted blocksize increase hardfork because 1) hardforks were inherently risky and could be easily attacked; 2) SegWit fixed some fundamental development-stalling bugs in Bitcoin. All these people disguised themselves as "Bitcoiners with different opinions".
For a period of time, these people spammed rBitcoin. They did it with lies and misinformations. The mods did their job and stopped them. When their operations got hard, Roger Ver, who was an early Bitcoin adopter (bitcoin dot com owner) but believed to have become a secret Ethereum stakeholder thus Bitcoin hater later, created rBTC sub in the name of free speech. They claimed rBitcoin was censored and theirs wasn't. However, although they didn't delete the posts they didn't like, they used downvoting to hide them. They claimed rBitcoin banned "Bitcoiners with different opinions" and they didn't, but they actually did. With these configurations, rBTC became the nest of them all.
Before Bcash fork, rBTC sub pretended to talk about Bitcoin while spreading lies and misinformations, such as that Bitcoin development is controlled by evil Blockstream and Blockstream wanted SegWit.
Then an epic battle in the community happened. SegWit was activated. Bcash forked at the same time. Bitmain moved lots of their resources to Bcash. But the company saw Bcash as not Bitcoin. With SegWit activated and Bitmain moving on, altcoiners and other haters lost their focus for a while. They eventually came up with a new plan, which was to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, both figuratively and literally, and the idea that there could be many Bitcoin. This is mainly what they do now.
It's worth noting that there aren't many Bcash supporters in rBTC. They pretend to support it in order to undetermine Bitcoin.
TLDR: rBTC was created by a Bitcoin hater (altcoiner); was filled with Bitcoin cheaters (miner's shills) and Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on); is filled with Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on).

On a different matter, what do you think about modifying open source license when there are hostile actors?
The reason for the question is related to the war in Bitcoin. Luke (the Core dev) was frustrated by the hostile parties trying to take over control of Bitcoin. He once said if Bitcoin failed because of them, he would not work on another cryptocurrency, including any brand new one. I proposed modifying the license so that the devs have the final say about what to be included in the software. He said that wouldn't be free software. I'm lost in this matter. I'd like to know your opinions.
@_date: 2017-01-16 21:23:26
I'm not against consensus rule changes.
Softforks are consensus rule changes via in-system consensus. It's fully under control no matter what happens. As a result it's safe to change consensus rules with softforks.
Hardforks are either arbitrary changes without consensus, or (attempts of) consensus rule changes via not-in-system consensus. The first one is completely unacceptable, unless considered creating an altcoin. The second one is dangerous and can easily go out of control. As a result, it's unfavorable to change consensus rules with hardforks.
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:29:12
I understand timestamp can be changed. But even 10 minutes can provide only about 9 bits of space (600 vs 512=2^9).
Changing transactions, including changing the order, does make the source space much bigger. Is it the solution used in real world? It's slow, though, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:43:45


The OP I quoted was comparing traceability.


I believe in fee market (and I believed so before I got to know about the scaling "debate" in Bitcoin. So, no, I'm not "brainwashed by Core".). It will work out.


The answer is actually yes. The mining will be a lot more decentralized if it's cheaper. People are trying to make mining hardware more accessible. Imagine if any person can buy mining hardware. If CPU/GPU mining were possible, it would have been way more decentralized.


What's wrong with that?
In addition, the fact that regulating LN will end up fruitlessly (due to fallback to on-chain) will help to prevent it from happening in the first place, just like the fact that 51% attack will end up fruitlessly (due to PoW algorithm change) will help to prevent it from happening in the first place.

As you said, nowadays scammers are not quite capable. I'm not too much worried about them, especially because I don't switch wallet software. But we do know that there are capable hackers who have an eye on Bitcoin. They have acted, and they have succeeded. So far they've only hacked exchanges and famous coin owners because it can guarantee a big profit. But being able to hack a popular wallet software/app can also guarantee a big profit, especially when bitcoin's value keeps rising.

You are comparing a physical currency with a digital currency in the sense of how they are used. That won't work. They are always different in that sense. This includes on-chain transactions.
All digital currencies are locked in to computer systems. Your on-chain transacted BTC are locked in to the blockchain at the very least.
On-chain transactions do require middlemen. They are the computer systems and the miners. They may require KYC/AML, too. In fact, most people get their BTC through a process requiring them.

My question is more about compromised (by authorities for example) Secure Element providers of Ledger, i.e., it's about Ledger using bugged Secure Element without them knowing. But your answer covers the question to some extent. Is there any addition?
My biggest concern is if a bugged Secure Element from the official provider of Ledger can enable the hostile party to access the keys in some way, e.g., knowing the keys remotely, moving the coins to some arbitrary addresses, and so on.
Edit: For example, can a RF/Bluetooth emitter be embedded in Secure Element, which sends out confidential information from time to time? Things like that.

Added systems with zero or negative entropy are rare. They can exist in theories, as in mathematics for example. They can exist in software systems. But in a social environment, there is simply no way an added system doesn't come with extra entropy, and the existing added systems all come with large amount of entropy because none of them is thoroughly scientifically checked before they go live. I agree with you complexity may not be a problem. But the accompanying chaos/entropy does always make the system more messy.

Basically it's a way that users can vote in soft-forks. Imagine that in the current SegWit debate, all sensible users choose to use SegWit-supporting miners/pools. Then those who don't will lose profits. They may have to make a choice.

This is the best answer to the question about how much is huge, which is asked quite often.

Again, the word "wallet" is misleading. You generate *keys/addresses* on bitaddress. Every private key has a corresponding public key, and every public key has a corresponding address(, therefore every private key has a corresponding address), and vice versa. Addresses are independent.
You can add coins to the same address. It's called address reuse, which is advised against by experts, for the privacy of yourself and the people who you interact with in Bitcoin. Again, in spite of the expert opinions, people still do it.
Although not well-accepted, some people deem BIP39/BIP44 as paper wallet since all you need to save is 12 to 24 words called (master) seed plus an optional password. It can be used to avoid address reuse. Basically you generate the seed, then import the xpub to a wallet app. The app will generate a new address every time the old one is used, i.e., some bitcoins are sent to it. (You can import the xpriv or even use the seed directly in a BIP39/BIP44 wallet app, but it defeats the purpose of paper wallet, which is cold storage.) Check out this online BIP39/BIP44 tool:

I think you are saying since there is chance that a block is orphaned, there is risk of filling the block with fake transactions. And the risk is that the fees in the fake transactions are collected by other block creator. Is that right?
If that's the case, why would the faker broadcast his fake transactions? Without broadcasting the fake transactions, there is no risk of losing the transaction fees.

The users of the current Bitcoin get into Bitcoin based on the current rules. Their rights of their possessions of "Bitcoin" cannot be infringed. You can't give them something named Bitcoin then after while tell them what they have got is now something else. This is not just about morality. I believe it's protected by contract laws.
From a different aspect, if the majority of hashrate can determine what Bitcoin is, miners can dictate what rules Bitcoin have. What if the majority of hashrate wants to change the 21M coins rule? They can hard-fork and name the new coin "Bitcoin" according to your logic.
The coin/chain without rule changes is always the original one, thus owns the original name. Period. Even if only one user of Bitcoin doesn't accept a hard-fork, the hard-fork is *not* Bitcoin and the coin that the person uses *is* Bitcoin. It's why hard-forks require consensus, which is 100% agreement, *in order to preserve the name of Bitcoin*.

Although I agree with the part that we should try to perfect the technology, I totally disagree with the statement against legal actions.
We live in laws. Without laws, Bitcoin (or any other technology) can easily be stopped. The enemies of Bitcoin can just hire bad guys worldwide to beat all Bitcoiners who run nodes down and kill those who dare to fight back. They are rich enough to do so.
It's totally reasonable to seek for the protection of laws when your legal rights are infringed or your legal benefits are damaged.

The hashrate of BCH can be faked. Jihan has a secret farm. He is able to mine BCH much faster. He can trick the public to make it seem that it's ViaBTC's pool that find the blocks. He can trick the public by delaying the findings of the blocks. He can gradually shorten the intervals of the findings to create an illusion that BCH is gaining supports from miners. There are all sorts of tricks he can play.

This is the same as saying SegWit2x made BIP148 irrelevant, which is misleading. It was BIP148 that made SegWit2x happen.

I believe I've defeated the argument in the comments. I'm not taking about for-profit attacks. I'm talking about not-for-profit attacks attempting to suffocating Bitcoin, as well as all PoW-based cryptocurrencies if wanted, once and for all. Hard-forks won't solve the problem because the attacker has more GPU/CPU hashpower. No PoW-based chain/coin can process any transaction.
As an example, if China government coerce Jihan, the would instantly have the ASIC farm ready, and the only thing to worry is to build the GPU/CPU farm.


It's certain that the more miners join Bitcoin, the less likely the attack can succeed. And when government supported mining is at scale, it will be hard to launch such an attack. But at the same time it's also not impossible, especially at this stage.

This post of yours, [BitPay's level headed response to Segwit2x] ( contains two tricks : 1) BitPay tries to trick its customers into using an altcoin as Bitcoin; 2) You tried to trick the community in this sub that what BitPay did was good (level-headed).


There are solid proofs that Bitcoin network has been spammed. It's very reasonable to believe that the current congestion is an intended attack in order to either prove SegWit doesn't help or justify the 2x hard-fork. Another possibility is that Jihan is trying the last-minute exploitation of AsicBoost before it becomes unconcealable. Neither is a problem of the blocksize.


They are talking about the possibility of PoW change in case of an attack. I don't see that a problem. In fact, I'll question their competency if they don't. We discussed the same possibility during the BIP148 movement.


I agree Luke is an extremist, which I don't see as a problem itself. As an example, Andrew Groove of Intel wrote a book named *Only the Paranoid Survive*. In addition, it makes perfect sense that the smaller the block is, the more decentralized Bitcoin will be. As a result, I don't think lowering the blocksize is unthinkable, as long as there is scientific research supporting it, which I believe it has. You have to take into account that the majority of the blocks is occupied by spamming transactions to understand it.


You will have to have proofs for such a claim. What Core tries to protect is the decentralization of Bitcoin, which is easily seeable. The claim of miners being hostile has unquestionable proofs such as AsicBoost, AntBleed and so on, as well as solid proofs such as the spamming attacks. What are your proofs for your claim (that haven't been debunked)?

Bitcoin is designed to be an electronic cash, and an electronic cash only. It is not designed to be an all-in-one transaction processor. If some people want such a thing, they have the freedom to create it. But it is not Bitcoin. I'd even argue it's in Bitcoin's blood that it would fight against those things, because they are a part of the corrupted economical world. Miners also have the freedom to choose what chain to work on. The competition of security doesn't always matter, as long as it's secure enough. It's the same for profitability. There are other factors in play.

How is the time determined in BCH? As far as I know, there is no global time in Bitcoin. It may be feasible in BCH that the time is determined by the local clock, but it may not work on Bitcoin. This is my uneducated guess.
Another problem I can think of is attacks by not mining, or mining a secret chain without broadcasting it, until the difficulty is adjusted. Not sure if there is any economic incentive to do so, though.

Strictly speaking, it's BIP148 alone that **makes** SegWit happen. BIP91 is merely **the way** SegWit happens.
If there weren't BIP91, there would have been another solution. If no solution were created, either miners would simply follow BIP148 rules, or they would split the chain. Either way, we get SegWit.
In other words, SegWit will always happen with or without BIP91. So, no, BIP91 didn't contribute to making SegWit happen.

I have no idea what motive is behind BIP91. Is it benign (and dishonest by tricking miners to activate SegWit and throwing away the 2x part)? Is it neutral (and in the hope of uniting the community)? Is it malicious (by using SegWit2x as a trojan horse to trick people into accepting 2mb hard-fork)? I choose to skip the question.
BIP91 does come with some effect. With it, the success of BIP148 becomes arguable. It's not a clear cut anymore. I personally think BIP91 has damaged UASF. We can always defend the effectiveness of BIP148, but it will be no different from any other argument we have with the attackers of Bitcoin - we are right and they are wrong but they will keep coming. But we aren't living in an ideal world. So the life will go on, and the battles will go on.

Debit, like on-chain transactions, is traceable. LN is not, which makes it more cash than on-chain transactions.


As far as I know, LN doesn't require trusting anyone.


It's why we should try our best to make running LN hubs as cheaply as possible, so that it can be as decentralized as possible. It's the same reason why we try to avoid on-chain scaling as much as possible in the first place - to avoid centralization.
LN isn't a part of Bitcoin. It just provides an option in addition to on-chain transactions. If it gets heavily regulated, people can always fall back to on-chain transactions.

Then they'd better off fork before the deadline if they eventually won't support SegWit.
On the other hand, if I were a Bitcoin hater, my best strategy now would be to delay BU's fork until the deadline passes because in that case Core team will likely to fall apart (no developer will be happy when months even years of effort goes in vain, especially if the decision is mainly made by laymen) therefore Bitcoin will fall apart. Am I right?
If that's true, our best strategy should be to encourage BU to fork as soon as possible, if we can be sure they won't comply, right?

Let me make this clear: because Bitcoin is so hard to kill, its enemies attack Bitcoin from all angles. Some directly attacks Bitcoin and the devs. Some claim they support Core to some extent. Some may even support Core in a long run, and attack Core in the most critical time. By doing so, they make themselves look innocent and the attacks appear genuine concerns.
So, in fact, you are not bought after BU/BTrash. You have always been an attacker of Bitcoin.

As said, checking hash values is the right way. You can be certain the version is original unaltered, if you can find the original unaltered hashes.
Try looking for the hashes on web.archive.org, in case other sources are compromised. Archive.org may be compromised, too. But I can't think of a better way. Better get the hashes verified on different websites on archive.org.
I don't trust VeraCrypt (yet), either. An audit from a commercial company is far from enough. Signal just received [an audit from academics] ( which is much more trustworthy.
[Filehippo's current page] ( shows the MD5 is 7A23AC83A0856C352025A6F7C9CC1526. [The same page on archive.org] ( on different times shows the same (I've checked 2012 and 2016 only). Do the same thing to other software hosting sites and their histories. If all hashes match, it should be safe. The more sites you check, the safer it will be.
Edit 2:
Make sure you connections to all the websites you check use HTTPS. If you are a high profile target, your connections may be compromised. In that case, only websites using HTTPS can be trusted. Use VPN and/or TOR for better protection.
SHA256 is preferable because it's safer than MD5. But it may not be available.

Thanks for answering.


I'm confused. I thought non-outsourceable mining means you-have-to-do-it-all-by-yourself mining, meaning no mining pool is possible, in order to resolve mining centralization. Maybe I was totally wrong?


I don't understand how a hasher can steal reward from the pool operator. The marker root the hasher receives from the operator contains coinbase transaction with mining reward sent to pool operator. How can it be possible to steal the reward? Are we talking about different kinds of pools? All I know is that p2pool doesn't work this way.


If there is a solution to disable all kinds of pools therefore decentralized mining can be achieved directly, such as including signature in block hash header, as shown in the lecture, do we still need decentralized pools?


Is this the reason why we need decentralized pools to stand against big miners, even if there is a way to disable centralized pool mining?

At present, miners get "paid" with newly "minted" bitcoins as well as "tips" from the users who initiate the transactions.
After all bitcoins are "minted", miners get "paid" with "tips" from the users who initiate the transactions only, since no more new bitcoins can be "minted".
The newly "minted" bitcoins are called block rewards. The "tips" are called block fees.
At present, block rewards are much higher than block fees.
After all bitcoins are "minted", block rewards will be zero and block fees will be high - so high that it's good enough to provide the incentive for mining.

I'm trying to understand the differences between pruning and SPV nodes. Are the following statements correct?
- Pruning: A node of pruning mode is the same in every way as a full node, except that all spent transactions are removed from the blockchain. The entire blockchain has to be downloaded thus fully verified prior to pruning. A node of pruning mode is capable of verify new transactions with 100% certainty.
- SPV nodes: An SPV node is the same as a full node except that it only downloads and keeps block headers, plus transactions of interest. The chain is not verified when it's established locally. It relies on full nodes to verify transactions, therefore is not with 100% certainty.

In addition, if Roger Ver is malicious, his best strategy should be to stall the fork and appear hesitant. The longer this uncertainty and the fight last, the bigger the damage it will cause. When the fork actually happens, everything will settle very quickly and the chaos will end.
From a long term point of view (forget about the current war and look to say five years from now), similar situations may occur again, be it malicious or not. It's better we get prepared/accustomed now.

Core don't maintain any chain. (They do maintain checkpoints of the chain in the code. But it is irrelevant here.) The chain is maintained by nodes. If there is a hardfork, the nodes not upgrading will be maintaining the old chain, while the nodes that upgrade will be maintaining a new chain. Whether a chain survives depends on supports.
The repo doesn't play a role here. Different repos can have the same consensus therefore use the same chain. On the other hand, the consensus rules can be changed on the same repo therefore a fork occurs.

I see that question from time to time. Whether I see it, I post the following comment: 
Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin.
What was Bcash when it was created?
In a nutshell,
1. Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.
2. This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced more miners than every other competitor and potential all of them combined in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?
Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. Bcash developers even failed to remove SegWit related code completely. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may also include bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and  Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.
There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC (BCH) and BcashSV (BSV). Bcash (BcashABC) was 51% attacked by two pools and its blockchain history was modified. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.

According to my understanding, the reason why man-made passwords are crackable is because malicious security experts (hackers), driven by financial benefits, have spent tons of time/efforts/resources in researching how regular people come up with passwords. However, no such level of time/efforts/resources has been made by benign security experts to help regular people to come up with harder to crack password.
Do you think it won't make any difference if the same amount of time/efforts/resources are allocated by benign security experts, such as Bruce Schneier and Carnegie Mellon University's computer scientists in [this article] (

I believe the problem lies in 7zip's AES implementation. I'm not saying it's not secure. Just saying it's the concern, for every security related software product.
I don't trust VeraCrypt, by the way.  If I have to, I'll use TrueCrypt. Maybe a TrueCrypt volume inside a VeraCrypt volume, or the other way around, with two different passwords.
Edit: typo.

Would you check if my understandings are correct?
- Pruning: A node of pruning mode is the same in every way as a full node, except that all spent transactions are removed from the blockchain. The entire blockchain has to be downloaded thus fully verified prior to pruning. A node of pruning mode is capable of verify new transactions with 100% certainty.
- SPV nodes: An SPV node is the same as a full node except that it only downloads and keeps block headers, plus transactions of interest. The chain is not verified when it's established locally. It relies on full nodes to verify transactions, therefore is not with 100% certainty.

I guess the difference is that the Core team tries their best not to introduce massive changes to the current protocol, which is a right thing to do.
Don't take it the wrong way. I'm concerned while thinking that eventually dramatical changes have to be introduced because the current Bitcoin protocol is faulty by design. I just don't have an answer of how to resolve it without chaos or risk induced by hard-forking.

At this point, it's hard to expect a unified standard.
A potential solution would be to ask the user to write down the derivation path with the seed (and make it a standard). Because the derivation path is a part of the information that's necessary for recreating the wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-24 00:19:07
Making the derivation party understandable by users is another challenge. We may need something similar to the seed for derivation paths. For example "money air" stands for "m/44'" and "money alcohol" stands for "m/49'". (Air is the no. 44 word of BIP39. Alcohol is no. 49.) We may need a different list, though. But again, this requires standardization, which is hard.

This is the first time I'm told pools help against mining centralization. I've read it many times in posts/articles that nowadays the majority of hashing power is controlled by less than five pools thus it's becoming too centralized, the decentralized mining pool (P2pool) occurs to counter the situation, and things like that. I'm confused.
I understand miners can switch pools easily. But, as some examples, 1) some pool has already been mining empty blocks; 2) pools can choose to deny service. These behaviors aren't strictly malicious or have a catastrophic consequence. Miners won't switch pools because of them. But they are harmful.


I don't understand this statement. Why are people unable to mine bigger blocks? Is it because of bandwidth/latency?

Nodes don't get paid in any way.
The word "confirmations" may be a little misleading. One may perceive it as "how many nodes confirmed it". It actually refers to the number of blocks mined. If it's one confirmation it means a block (the last block on the chain) including the transaction is mined. If there are more than one confirmations, say N confirmations, it means N-1 blocks have been built (mined) upon the block that contains the transaction.

That's a marketing trick played by closed source hardware wallet makers or their distributors, namely Ledger and Coldcard. Both use Secure Element. Trezor purposefully does not use any closed source non-genetic hardware, so not using Secure Element becomes the main attack surface.
Note that it's well established in security communities around the world that only publicly studied solutions can be proven secure. (It's why NSA choose open protocols like AES and SHA as standards.) Any closed-door solutions are considered insecure inherently. Some closed source solutions even use obscurity as security, which is well established to be false. Not to mention many believe Secure Element has long been backdoored. In other words, we, the end users, may not be aware of Secure Element's security vulnerabilities, but we know they are insecure.

Standard of living improved because the technology development outweighs job losing and things like that, by improving productivity. And fair policies such as social security helps technologies to achieve that.
In addition, standard of living improving is arguable. Try saying this to people who lost their jobs and homes in the financial crisis. The technologies can provide what they need for living, but poor money/resource distribution took that away.
Bankers use the same narrative to say that it's their money policies that have made the changes. Both are wrong/lies. It's technology alone. Policies can play good roles and bad roles. As long as they are not overly bad, technologies make our lives better. That's why we need better policies and laws. There is nothing wrong with Marx when it's comes to trying to fix that problem. Whether his approach is right is a totally different topic.

This is a question I have since studying Princeton University's Bitcoin course on Coursera. It isn't elaborated in the course.
If the consensus rule is changed so that blocks must include a signature of both Nonce and extraNonce by miner's private key as well as miner's public key, can it theoretically resolve mining centralization caused by pooled mining?
If yes, is it a candidate solution for mining decentralization? (I understand this requires a hardfork so it is not happening soon.) If no, why? (I can see that it bloats the blocks and slows both mining and verifying. But I'm not sure if either of them is a reason to invalidate the idea.)

I also have a write-up about rbtc:
The brief history of rBTC
A long time ago, there was only rBitcoin sub; rBTC was completely irrelevant to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. At some stage, some people, in the name of scaling, began a coordinated propaganda of promoting a blocksize increase hardfork and bashing a softfork solution named SegWit, which had been implemented in the protocol but was not yet activated, in rBitcoin. These people mainly fell into two groups, one being shills of Bitmain, the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world, the other being altcoiners, mainly Ethereum stakeholders. There might be other Bitcoin haters, such as bankers and remittance companies, but their identities are hard to confirm. The first group promoted the blocksize increase hardfork instead of the activation of SegWit because SegWit unintendedly disabled Bitmain's secret cheat in mining (Covert AsicBoost), which helped make them the number one in the market. The second group wanted Ethereum to dethrone Bitcoin. The second group and the rest promoted the blocksize increase hardfork because 1) SegWit fixed some fundamental development-stalling bugs in Bitcoin and freed Bitcoin to the extent that it might render their coins worthless; 2) hardforks were inherently risky even when not under attack, could be easily attacked, could easily result in chain splits, which would devastatingly damage Bitcoin's value and people's belief in it; 3) hardfork blocksize increases could easily lead to centralization, which would destroy Bitcoin. They together disguised themselves as "Bitcoiners with different opinions".
For a period of time, these people spammed rBitcoin with lies and misinformation, oftentimes in an aggressive way. The mods did their job and stopped them. When their operations got hard, their leader, Roger Ver, who was an early Bitcoin adopter but believed to have become a secret Ethereum stakeholder therefore a Bitcoin hater later, somehow gained the ownership of rBTC. His paid employees became mods of it. They marketed rBTC as a Bitcoin sub with free speech. They claimed rBitcoin was censored and theirs wasn't. They mainly censored the sub by hiding the posts/comments they didn't like with massive downvoting (a feature of Reddit), which would result in negative karma of the posters/commenters, which would subsequently enable a 1 post per 10 minutes limitation (another feature of Reddit), effectively stopping them from freely expressing themselves. They claimed they wouldn't/didn't remove posts/comments and they wouldn't/didn't ban "Bitcoiners with different opinions". The truth is, they did both. A lot. With these configurations, rBTC became the nest of them all.
Before Bcash fork, what rBTC sub did was pretending to talk about Bitcoin while spreading lies and misinformation, such that hardforks were safe/good, hardfork blocksize increases were safe/good, softforks were bad, SegWit was evil, Bitcoin development was controlled by Blockstream, only Blockstream wanted SegWit, Blockstream was controlled by bankers, rBitcoin was censored, and things like that.
Then an epic battle in the community happened. Users pushed SegWit to be activated via User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF). Bitmain created Bcash, which was basically Bitcoin with SegWit removed, to preserve their mining privilege. SegWit was activated. Bcash forked away at the same time. Bitmain moved non-trivial proportion of their resources to Bcash. But the company saw Bcash as not Bitcoin. With SegWit activated and Bitmain moving on, the altcoiners and haters teamed up to push SehWit2x, a hard fork after SegWit activation, until it failed in all aspects. After that, they lost their directions for a while. They eventually came up with a new plan, which was to support Bcash, sell Bcash as Bitcoin (both figuratively and literally) and the idea that there could be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols.
It's worth noting that there aren't many actual Bcash supporters in rBTC. They pretend to support it in order to undetermine Bitcoin.
Fun facts: Vitalik Buterin (founder and spearhead of Ethereum) is popular in rBTC. Jorge Stolfi (\u\jstolfi), a well-known Bitcoin hater who publicly filed reports to authority claiming Bitcoin (but not other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum!) a scam, is popular in rBTC.
Bonus facts: Besides rBTC, Roger Ver owns Bitcoin(dot)com website and is believed to own  Twitter handle. Bitcoin(dot)com sells Bcash as Bitcoin by making their wallet app create Bcash wallet by default and with no clear indication.  actively bashes Bitcoin, pushes Bcash, and blocks people (so that its followers cannot see its lies getting refuted). All of the three major Bitcoin resources are either known or believed to be purchased from other people. Purchasing subreddit is in violation of Reddit's Terms of Service.
TLDR: rBTC (as a Bitcoin-related sub) was created by a Bitcoin hater (an altcoiner); was filled with Bitcoin cheaters (miner's shills) and Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on); is filled with Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on). It is not a Bitcoin sub. It's an anti-Bitcoin sub.

@_date: 2019-08-23 23:11:57
Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin.
What was Bcash when it was created?
In a nutshell,
1. Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.
2. This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced more miners than every other competitor and potential all of them combined in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?
Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. Bcash developers even failed to remove SegWit related code completely. Bcash's dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm was so buggy that it took few seconds to mine a block, while it should be around 10 minutes, and lots of blocks were mined at that speed. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may also include bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and  Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.
There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC (BCH) and BcashSV (BSV). Bcash (BcashABC) was 51% attacked by two pools and its blockchain history was modified. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.

In theory, a cryptocurrency can use transactions as building blocks. In reality, I can think of two reasons to use blocks:
1. It's for efficiency. Packing up lots of transactions in blocks make it more efficient in many ways.
2. It's because of proof-of-work. (It's still related to efficiency.) The problem is that it's very hard to get a PoW. You don't want to use that kind of effort on every transaction. Theoretically it's possible to change the protocol so that PoW is done on a transaction basis with much lowered difficulties. But since there are a lot of competitions, there will be a lot of competing PoWs thus a lot of orphan transactions and/or forks, making it infeasible.

Bitcoin Core, the reference Bitcoin client, is free software, which has a specific definition. It has many characteristics but a fundamental one is that it's the community that decides how the software should be, not the developers, the sponsors or anyone else. As a result, no one gets to decide who can contribute. There is actually no Core "team". Anyone can contribute. The proposed code is reviewed by existing contributors before being accepted and merged. There has been tens of new contributors in the last few months.
In Bitcoin, there is an additional step for any big change to be introduced into Bitcoin. It's to write a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) first. After a BIP is written, it gets discussed by the major contributors, then the community. When there is majority support, developers then implement the feature, which is then to be approved via the code review process.
After a feature is implemented and merged, there is a process of activating the feature if it involves consensus rule changes, if the changes are backwards compatible. This is called a soft-fork. A soft-fork usually requires the majority of the mining power to activate, which is called Miner Activated Soft Fork (MASF). Occasionally, the community may activate a soft fork via User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) if miners try to stop a feature from being activated. For example,SegWit is activated via UASF last year after it's stalled by attackers and the community got pissed off.
In addition to soft forks, which are backward compatible consensus rule changes, there are non-backward-compatible consensus rule changes. These are hard forks. The activation of hard forks is very different from that of soft forks. It's much much riskier. Fortunately no hard fork (for rule changes) has been adopted in Bitcoin. (There has been a few hard forks fixing critical bugs.)

I had a little more reading. It seems to me that Argon2 contains both a key derivation function and a hash function.
Wikipedia says it's a KDF. The official page says it's a hash function. [This page] ( which looks like an implementation of Argon2i, presents a KDF and a hash function (called password storage). The hash function seems to have KDF built-in. The parameter in the hash function, opslimit, seems to be the rounds of key derivation and have minimum value of 3. It implies that with 3 it's fast.

You didn't choose to push SegWit2x because you saw a strong will in the community to defend Bitcoin; you didn't want to piss off the community; you didn't want to lose your customers.
You didn't choose to support Bitcoin because you saw big money on the SegWit2x side; you didn't want to upset them; you wanted to preserve the potential business opportunities with them. (And OP pointed out you were already doing business with one of the major players on that side.)
Your decision was nothing but business in both aspects.
I've never said you are bad people. I've only said you are classic businessmen who put business interests above things like integrity and principles, which you have evidently demonstrated. As a result, I believe you would probably obey the government when they bribe/force you to put a backdoor in your products. I'm not saying it has happened / is going to happen.

Not supporting OP's claim in a whole, but AFAIK it's common in stock markets that resourceful traders pump the price up after they finish accumulating quietly. So it's not impossible that some rich people/institution quietly bought a large amount of BTC in an exchange over a few months or over the counter or from miners with say 90% of their money, and used the rest to pump the market.

The concept of private and public keys is from asymmetric cryptography, or public-key cryptography. The two keys are a pair. The most common use of the technology is encryption. The public key, which is shared with other people, is used by other people to encrypt messages to send to you. The private key, which is kept secret, is used to decrypt the encrypted messages other people encrypt and send to you. The technology can also be used for digital signature. Bitcoin mainly uses its digital signature function. Every transaction is signed with the private key and verified with the public key that's presented in it.

There is no consensus on the code style. Neither is there for Satoshi's available time. Some say he's available US time. Some say UK time. There is also no consensus on his image in communications. A lot of people asay Satoshi was very kind, patient and modest, but I personally (and I'm not alone) find his famous "If you don’t believe it or don’t get it, I don’t have the time to try to convince you" quote unkind, impatient and arrogant, which happens to match CSW.
He needed a payment system to do the job. He looked, found some candidates, paid for them to do the job. That makes him the buyer of the project. (I'm not saying it happened.)
It's true that there is no evidence he involved marginally. But you are making a claim that he didn't, which is faulty. I merely point out a possibility that he actually had been involved and everything still makes sense. I'm not making a claim.

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin.
What was Bcash when it was created?
In a nutshell,
1. Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.
2. This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced more miners than every other competitor and potential all of them combined in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?
Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. Bcash developers even failed to remove SegWit related code completely. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may including bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and  Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.
There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC (BCH) and BcashSV (BSV). Bcash (BcashABC) was 51% attacked by two pools and its blockchain history was modified. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.

That's at best a misunderstanding and at worst a lie. You are at best misunderstanding the situation and at worst one of the Bitcoin haters. And the latter is more likely. Trivializing the power of full nodes is one of the (main) ways that Bitcoin is attacked because Bitcoin haters know that reducing the number of full nodes is practically the only way to destroy (or control) Bitcoin and see how effective users can force a change in Bitcoin.
SegWit and its creators were bashed for years and the major miners firmly rejected SegWit for years. After UASF is in action, it's activated within a few months. Say whatever you want and you can't change the fact that miners had no choice but fully complied to UASFers.
SegWit2x is DOA, as you mentioned. It's a joke, like the many others that Bitcoin attackers have tried.

To save you some time, here it goes:
The brief history of rBTC
A long time ago, there was only rBitcoin sub; rBTC was completely irrelevant to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. At some stage, some people, in the name of scaling, began a coordinated propaganda of promoting a blocksize increase hardfork and bashing a softfork solution named SegWit, which had been implemented in the protocol but was not yet activated, in rBitcoin. These people mainly fell into two groups, one being shills of Bitmain, the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world, the other being altcoiners, mainly Ethereum stakeholders. The first group promoted the blocksize increase hardfork instead of the activation of SegWit because SegWit unintendedly disabled Bitmain's secret cheat in mining (Covert AsicBoost), which helped make them the number one in the market. The second group wanted Ethereum to dethrone Bitcoin. There might be other Bitcoin haters, such as bankers and remittance companies, but their identities are hard to confirm. The second group and the rest promoted the blocksize increase hardfork because 1) SegWit fixed some fundamental development-stalling bugs in Bitcoin and freed Bitcoin to the extent that it might render their coins worthless; 2) hardforks were inherently risky even when not under attack, could be easily attacked, could easily result in chain splits, which would devastatingly damage Bitcoin's value and people's belief in it; 3) hardfork blocksize increases could easily lead to centralization, which would destroy Bitcoin. They together disguised themselves as "Bitcoiners with different opinions".
For a period of time, these people spammed rBitcoin with lies and misinformation, oftentimes in an aggressive way. The mods did their job and stopped them. When their operations got hard, their leader, Roger Ver, who was an early Bitcoin adopter but believed to have become a secret Ethereum stakeholder therefore a Bitcoin hater later, somehow gained the ownership of rBTC. His paid employees became mods of it. They marketed rBTC as a Bitcoin sub with free speech. They claimed rBitcoin was censored and theirs wasn't. They mainly censored the sub by hiding the posts/comments they didn't like with massive downvoting (a feature of Reddit), which would result in negative karma of the posters/commenters, which would subsequently enable a 1 post per 10 minutes limitation (another feature of Reddit), effectively stopping them from freely expressing themselves. They claimed they wouldn't/didn't remove posts/comments and they wouldn't/didn't ban "Bitcoiners with different opinions". The truth is, they did both. A lot. With these configurations, rBTC became the nest of them all.
Before Bcash fork, what rBTC sub did was pretending to talk about Bitcoin while spreading lies and misinformation, such that hardforks were safe/good, hardfork blocksize increases were safe/good, softforks were bad, SegWit was evil, Bitcoin development was controlled by Blockstream, only Blockstream wanted SegWit, Blockstream was controlled by bankers, rBitcoin was censored, and things like that.
Then an epic battle in the community happened. Users pushed SegWit to be activated via User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF). Bitmain created Bcash, which was basically Bitcoin with SegWit removed, to preserve their mining privilege. SegWit was activated. Bcash forked away at the same time. Bitmain moved non-trivial proportion of their resources to Bcash. But the company saw Bcash as not Bitcoin. With SegWit activated and Bitmain moving on, the altcoiners and haters teamed up to push SehWit2x, a hard fork after SegWit activation, until it failed in all aspects. After that, they lost their directions for a while. They eventually came up with a new plan, which was to support Bcash, sell Bcash as Bitcoin (both figuratively and literally) and the idea that there could be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols.
It's worth noting that there aren't many actual Bcash supporters in rBTC. They pretend to support it in order to undetermine Bitcoin.
Fun facts: Vitalik Buterin (founder and spearhead of Ethereum) is popular in rBTC. Jorge Stolfi (\u\jstolfi), a well-known Bitcoin hater who publicly filed reports to authority claiming Bitcoin (but not other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum!) a scam, is popular in rBTC.
Bonus facts: Besides rBTC, Roger Ver owns Bitcoin(dot)com website and is believed to own  Twitter handle. Bitcoin(dot)com sells Bcash as Bitcoin by making their wallet app create Bcash wallet by default and with no clear indication.  actively bashes Bitcoin, pushes Bcash, and blocks people (so that its followers cannot see its lies getting refuted). All of the three major Bitcoin resources are either known or believed to be purchased from other people. Purchasing subreddit is in violation of Reddit's Terms of Service.
TLDR: rBTC (as a Bitcoin-related sub) was created by a Bitcoin hater (an altcoiner); was filled with Bitcoin cheaters (miner's shills) and Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on); is filled with Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on). It is not a Bitcoin sub. It's an anti-Bitcoin sub.

If the 30-digit number is something personal, it is vulnerable to hackers specifically targeting you. So it is unsafe.
Let's assume it's not something personal. 30 digits of numbers provide 10^30 possibilities. Current overall Bitcoin network hashrate is roughly 2 * 10^18 hashes/second. If someone possessing similar scale of hash power, e.g., NSA, tries to crack down a password, the number of hashes tried in a years is roughly: 2 * 10^18 * 3 * 10^7 = 6 * 10^25. So it will take &gt;10000 years for such an attacker to crack your key. You can decide if it safe for you. Note that a true random 256-bit key has 2^256 (~10^77) possibilities, which is 10^47 times more secure.

Will you consider the seed extraction vulnerability an issue if Trezor allows more than nine digits of numeric-only PIN or letters in PIN? Both are not the case at the moment. According to my calculation, a 16-digit numeric-only PIN can provide roughly the same security as a 12-character lower-case-letter-only passphrase, which would cost $77m to bruteforce, according to Trezor's research.
Will you switch Trezor with ColdCard in the subscription?

New miners can never mine a block? No, thanks.
Stake == inherent centralization. PoW mining may be temporarily centralized, but the centralization is not inherent thus can be broken by external force.

It makes perfect sense if what you said is about mining. But I was talking about verification. Does the verification process, in which newly received newly mined blocks are verified, require such a dramatic change in the ASIC design?
About your "edit" part, let me clarify. According to my understanding of pooled mining, the pool server sets extraNonce for every miner. Then it calculates the merkle root. Then it sends the merkle root as well as other parts of the block header to every miner. Then the miners change Nonce and calculate the hashes. In my question, in order to make pooled mining impossible, Nonce together with extraNonce are (re)signed. Changing either one will result in the necessity of signing, therefore the per-miner task allocation is impossible. The signature is in the block header. It is not a part of the merkle tree. Does it change anything you said in your "edit" part?

The brief history of rBTC
A long time ago, there was only rBitcoin sub; rBTC was completely irrelevant to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. At some stage, some people, in the name of scaling, began a coordinated propaganda of promoting a blocksize increase hardfork and bashing a softfork solution named SegWit, which had been implemented in the protocol but was not yet activated, in rBitcoin. These people mainly fell into two groups, one being shills of Bitmain, the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world, the other being altcoiners, mainly Ethereum stakeholders. The first group promoted the blocksize increase hardfork instead of the activation of SegWit because SegWit unintendedly disabled Bitmain's secret cheat in mining (Covert AsicBoost), which helped make them the number one in the market. The second group wanted Ethereum to dethrone Bitcoin. There might be other Bitcoin haters, such as bankers and remittance companies, but their identities are hard to confirm. The second group and the rest promoted the blocksize increase hardfork because 1) SegWit fixed some fundamental development-stalling bugs in Bitcoin and freed Bitcoin to the extent that it might render their coins worthless; 2) hardforks were inherently risky even when not under attack, could be easily attacked, could easily result in chain splits, which would devastatingly damage Bitcoin's value and people's belief in it; 3) hardfork blocksize increases could easily lead to centralization, which would destroy Bitcoin. They together disguised themselves as "Bitcoiners with different opinions".
For a period of time, these people spammed rBitcoin with lies and misinformation, oftentimes in an aggressive way. The mods did their job and stopped them. When their operations got hard, their leader, Roger Ver, who was an early Bitcoin adopter but believed to have become a secret Ethereum stakeholder therefore a Bitcoin hater later, somehow gained the ownership of rBTC. His paid employees became mods of it. They marketed rBTC as a Bitcoin sub with free speech. They claimed rBitcoin was censored and theirs wasn't. They mainly censored the sub by hiding the posts/comments they didn't like with massive downvoting (a feature of Reddit), which would result in negative karma of the posters/commenters, which would subsequently enable a 1 post per 10 minutes limitation (another feature of Reddit), effectively stopping them from freely expressing themselves. They claimed they wouldn't/didn't remove posts/comments and they wouldn't/didn't ban "Bitcoiners with different opinions". The truth is, they did both. A lot. With these configurations, rBTC became the nest of them all.
Before Bcash fork, what rBTC sub did was pretending to talk about Bitcoin while spreading lies and misinformation, such that hardforks were safe/good, hardfork blocksize increases were safe/good, softforks were bad, SegWit was evil, Bitcoin development was controlled by Blockstream, only Blockstream wanted SegWit, Blockstream was controlled by bankers, rBitcoin was censored, and things like that.
Then an epic battle in the community happened. Users pushed SegWit to be activated via User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF). Bitmain created Bcash, which was basically Bitcoin with SegWit removed, to preserve their mining privilege. SegWit was activated. Bcash forked away at the same time. Bitmain moved non-trivial proportion of their resources to Bcash. But the company saw Bcash as not Bitcoin. With SegWit activated and Bitmain moving on, the altcoiners and haters teamed up to push SehWit2x, a hard fork after SegWit activation, until it failed in all aspects. After that, they lost their directions for a while. They eventually came up with a new plan, which was to support Bcash, sell Bcash as Bitcoin (both figuratively and literally) and the idea that there could be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols.
It's worth noting that there aren't many actual Bcash supporters in rBTC. They pretend to support it in order to undetermine Bitcoin.
Fun facts: Vitalik Buterin (founder and spearhead of Ethereum) is popular in rBTC. Jorge Stolfi (\u\jstolfi), a well-known Bitcoin hater who publicly filed reports to authority claiming Bitcoin (but not other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum!) a scam, is popular in rBTC.
Bonus facts: Besides rBTC, Roger Ver owns Bitcoin(dot)com website and is believed to own  Twitter handle. Bitcoin(dot)com sells Bcash as Bitcoin by making their wallet app create Bcash wallet by default and with no clear indication.  actively bashes Bitcoin, pushes Bcash, and blocks people (so that its followers cannot see its lies getting refuted). All of the three major Bitcoin resources are either known or believed to be purchased from other people. Purchasing subreddit is in violation of Reddit's Terms of Service.
TLDR: rBTC (as a Bitcoin-related sub) was created by a Bitcoin hater (an altcoiner); was filled with Bitcoin cheaters (miner's shills) and Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on); is filled with Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on). It is not a Bitcoin sub. It's an anti-Bitcoin sub.

Multisig without a doubt is superior to SSS in probably every way. As a result, it's sensible that Casa, which provides multisig, does not support SSS.
However, I'd like to point out that the main reason for using SSS is the *safety* of the seed (in whatever form) instead of the *security* of the seed or the coins, while multisig is mainly focus on enhancing the security of the coins, although it effectively enhances the safety of the "seed" as well.


As a result, SSS does not (and subsequently cannot) compete with multisig on security, and apparently cannot compete with multisig on safety due to various technical reasons, which are addressed by the article. If the user has the option to choose multisig, they should.
But in the case that the user cannot or wouldn't choose multisig, I reckon that SSS may still have its value, and the only valid argument against using it should be either it does not enhance the safety, or it (significantly) weakens the security. Correct?

This is possible, both on hardware and software (OS and applications) level. But it's nearly impossible for it be specific for Bitcoin, even more so for the private keys, if you haven't downloaded software from shady sources. So the threat is not great if your computer is offline and free from random stuff from the internet. It's a totally different story otherwise.


Irreverent. If the website you download from uses HTTPS, the router can't do anything.


Same as your computer.


Some software, such as Bitcoin Core and Trezor's firmware, use deterministic building systems. You can verify the downloaded binary isn't a modified copy against the source code. You may not be technically savvy to review the code or do the build yourself, but the fact that anyone with the skill/knowledge is capable makes it a lot less likely to happen. Of course, this applies only to the open source ones with deterministic building.

You seed (words) is everything you need if you didn't use a passphrase along the seed. If you did use a passphrase with the seed, both will be needed and both are everything you need. You seed (plus passphrase) is your coins. Your wallet does not contain your coins. It only contains keys to your coins, which are located in the blockchain, and keys can be generated from the seed (plus the passphrase), by the wallet.
You can restore your original wallet to however many wallets, on however many devices. Of course, you don't want to do that.

You used "generally". Some people mine not for profit, but for the health of the network. I don't consider this a key argument, though.
Inherent may not be the right word. What I was trying to say is PoS uses the centralization to solve the problem, which is not the case in PoW, and the centralization in PoW can be broken by external actions, while PoS cannot.


There is no centralization pressure in PoS. PoS *is* centralization.
PoS has existed all the time. A traditional server is a PoS system with the server having 100% stake. You can easily create a PoS system with multiple servers by applying peer to peer communication and a stake-based voting system. The hyped PoS (by Ethereum) is basically that system, with the illusion that the server group is not predetermined, and by applying buzzwords like cryptocurrency, decentralized, distributed, and so on. But it's just a fancy word for server group after all.

For properly implemented secure code, it's simply probability. 12-word seed has the same level of security (usually measured by bits of entropy) as Bitcoin keys/addresses, which is 128-bit, which is astronomically large.
Open source hardware wallet is recommended because you can't review closed source ones, and backdoored firmware can generate insecure, including, identical seed.
There is no such thing as "seed phrase". There is the seed. There is the passphrase. The passphrase is not generated. It's picked arbitrarily by the user. The passphrase works with the seed to generate keys/addresses.

I picked 2018 summer, although I think may be risky. The choice is general, i.e., it is not about the block size. It's that **it takes at least roughly a year and a half, since the decision of hard-forking is made, for any hard-fork to be deployed safely and with the maximum benefits.** Note that it's a very rough estimation and it can be very conservative.
Two reasons:
1- It takes some time to communicate, negotiate and agree on how the hard-fork will be deployed.
2- Since hard-forks should be taken as a last resort, they are very rare therefore are precious opportunities for other tasks that require hard-forks, e.g., changes of the protocol, bug fixes, cleanup of code of soft-forks and so on, and the tasks that are better done in hard-forks than in soft-forks. Before a hard-fork is deployed, the community should come to an agreement on those supplementary tasks. Then they will be implemented, tested and included in the hard-fork. This takes time.
P.S., if at all possible, hard-forks should never happen.

Paper wallet is strongly discouraged by some Bitcoin experts. There are many pitfalls. On the other hand, it does provide some benefits that other wallets can't, such as it isn't hackable.

The brief history of rBTC
A long time ago, there was only rBitcoin sub; rBTC was completely irrelevant to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. At some stage, some people, in the name of scaling, began a coordinated propaganda of promoting a blocksize increase hardfork and bashing a softfork solution named SegWit, which had been implemented in the protocol but was not yet activated, in rBitcoin. These people mainly fell into two groups, one being shills of Bitmain, the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world, the other being altcoiners, mainly Ethereum stakeholders. The first group promoted the blocksize increase hardfork instead of the activation of SegWit because SegWit unintendedly disabled Bitmain's secret cheat in mining (Covert AsicBoost), which helped make them the number one in the market. The second group wanted Ethereum to dethrone Bitcoin. There might be other Bitcoin haters, such as bankers and remittance companies, but their identities are hard to confirm. The second group and the rest promoted the blocksize increase hardfork because 1) SegWit fixed some fundamental development-stalling bugs in Bitcoin and freed Bitcoin to the extent that it might render their coins worthless; 2) hardforks were inherently risky even when not under attack, could be easily attacked, could easily result in chain splits, which would devastatingly damage Bitcoin's value and people's belief in it; 3) hardfork blocksize increases could easily lead to centralization, which would destroy Bitcoin. They together disguised themselves as "Bitcoiners with different opinions".
For a period of time, these people spammed rBitcoin with lies and misinformation, oftentimes in an aggressive way. The mods did their job and stopped them. When their operations got hard, their leader, Roger Ver, who was an early Bitcoin adopter but believed to have become a secret Ethereum stakeholder therefore a Bitcoin hater later, somehow gained the ownership of rBTC. His paid employees became mods of it. They marketed rBTC as a Bitcoin sub with free speech. They claimed rBitcoin was censored and theirs wasn't. They mainly censored the sub by hiding the posts/comments they didn't like with massive downvoting (a feature of Reddit), which would result in negative karma of the posters/commenters, which would subsequently enable a 1 post per 10 minutes limitation (another feature of Reddit), effectively stopping them from freely expressing themselves. They claimed they wouldn't/didn't remove posts/comments and they wouldn't/didn't ban "Bitcoiners with different opinions". The truth is, they did both. A lot. With these configurations, rBTC became the nest of them all.
Before Bcash fork, what rBTC sub did was pretending to talk about Bitcoin while spreading lies and misinformation, such that hardforks were safe/good, hardfork blocksize increases were safe/good, softforks were bad, SegWit was evil, Bitcoin development was controlled by Blockstream, only Blockstream wanted SegWit, Blockstream was controlled by bankers, rBitcoin was censored, and things like that.
Then an epic battle in the community happened. Users pushed SegWit to be activated via User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF). Bitmain created Bcash, which was basically Bitcoin with SegWit removed, to preserve their mining privilege. SegWit was activated. Bcash forked away at the same time. Bitmain moved non-trivial proportion of their resources to Bcash. But the company saw Bcash as not Bitcoin. With SegWit activated and Bitmain moving on, altcoiners and other haters lost their directions for a while. They eventually came up with a new plan, which was to sell Bcash as Bitcoin (both figuratively and literally) and the idea that there could be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols.
It's worth noting that there aren't many actual Bcash supporters in rBTC. They pretend to support it in order to undetermine Bitcoin.
Fun facts: Vitalik Buterin (founder and spearhead of Ethereum) is popular in rBTC. Jorge Stolfi (\u\jstolfi), a well-known Bitcoin hater who publicly filed reports to authority claiming Bitcoin (but not other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum!) a scam, is popular in rBTC.
Bonus facts: Besides rBTC, Roger Ver owns Bitcoin(dot)com website and is believed to own  Twitter handle. Bitcoin(dot)com sells Bcash as Bitcoin by making their wallet app create Bcash wallet by default and with no clear indication.  actively bashes Bitcoin, pushes Bcash, and blocks people (so that its followers cannot see its lies getting refuted). All of the three major Bitcoin resources are either known or believed to be purchased from other people. Purchasing subreddit is in violation of Reddit's Terms of Service.
TLDR: rBTC (as a Bitcoin-related sub) was created by a Bitcoin hater (an altcoiner); was filled with Bitcoin cheaters (miner's shills) and Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on); is filled with Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on). It is not a Bitcoin sub. It's an anti-Bitcoin sub.

Mining pools is a centralized entity in Bitcoin, which we always want to try to get rid of. There is currently no solution to it, but it doesn't mean there will not be. Your idea ensure the existence of mining pools.


Cost is not an issue with centralization. A server has zero cost but ultimate centralization. Stake is a fancy word for server. (It's predetermined server group but the idea is the same.) Stake solutions are supposed to be low cost. A stake solution that's not massively cheaper is an ultimate failure.

Firstly, all your BTC are stored on the blockchain, not in your wallet. Your wallet is in fact a manager of keys that are bond to your BTC.
If you've done everything related to security properly, your BTC should be safe. Nothing needs to be running for them to be safe.
If you'd like to see them being in your possession, you don't have to use Trezor. Instead, you can export the Master Public Key and import it into any mobile/desktop wallet that supports the feature as a watch-only wallet.

Wrong. No one demands currency. People demands goods and services. Currency is just a tool, a medium. And you only need the *belief* that a currency will get you goods and services for it to work.


If a person is competent for his/her job, he/she doesn't need to be backed by anyone. If a thing is competent for its job, it doesn't need to be backed by anything. What's backing the sun to evict lights and heat? What's backing you to walk and talk? The whole "Bitcoin is not backed by anything" narrative is simply a moot point.
On the other hand, the fact that fiats need to be backed by government powers indicates that they are not competent for the job.

I respectfully disagree.
It may not help *a lot* in day-to-day transactions, but it does help by storing and serving the blockchain and the transactions. This is especially true when connected nodes are geographically close. It speeds up the data flow. Yes, there are lots of nodes out there, but saying it doesn't help is kind of like saying, admittedly not a perfect analog,  doesn't help since plenty of people are already doing it.
In addition, running a node helps the network on a more profound level. It basically announces that the user consciously maintains the Bitcoin protocol. It helps the survival of Bitcoin and it helps to stop any malicious takeover. It stops (to-be) totalitarian governments from even thinking about banning Bitcoin regionally. Governments turn.

BIP32/BIP39 are the standards Trezor use. With BIP32/BIP39, a passphrase can be used with the 24-word seed to create completely different keys/addresses. The passphrase is sometimes referred to as the 25th seed word, although it's not used the same way as the 24 seed words technically. If this is what you are talking about, it's not randomly generated. You decide what passphrase to use. Unlike the seed words, which must accord with the checksum algorithm, you can use any passphrase (there is no checksum requirement).

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin.
What was Bcash when it was created?
In a nutshell,
1. Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.
2. This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced more miners than every other competitor and potential all of them combined in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?
Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. Bcash developers even failed to remove SegWit related code completely. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may including bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and  Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.
There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC (BCH) and BcashSV (BSV). Bcash (BcashABC) was 51% attacked by two pools and its blockchain history was modified. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.

Bcash developers even failed to remove SegWit related code completely. Bcash's dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm was so buggy that it took few seconds to mine a block, while it should be around 10 minutes, and lots of blocks were mined at that speed. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may also include bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and  Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.
There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC (BCH) and BcashSV (BSV). Bcash (BcashABC) was 51% attacked by two pools and its blockchain history was modified. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.

It's actually not technical. It's more political. Bitcoin has been under attack. The attackers attempt to fork Bitcoin by changing the consensus rules that many of us are strongly against (for good reasons). The coming fork is SegWit2x. There will be two chains after the fork, one being Bitcoin, the other being SegWit2x. They attempt to trick people into believing SegWit2x chain is Bitcoin.
For any fork, you'll get equivalent number of coins on both chain.
BreadWallet will follow the chain with highest hashing power, which SegWit2x will likely to have because miners, who provide hashing services, are one of the parties supporting it. By doing that, the wallet will use SegWit2x chain rather than Bitcoin chain. As a result, your coins may be lost in transactions without you knowing.
You've got to educate yourself with the technology. Otherwise, you may lose your coins along the track. There have been many incidents.

The brief history of rBTC
When there was only rBitcoin subreddit, some people, in the name of scaling, were promoting blocksize increase hardfork and bashing softfork solution SegWit in rBitcoin. These people mainly fell into two groups, one being shills of Bitmain, the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world, the other being altcoiners, mainly Ethereum stakeholders. The first group promoted blocksize increase hardfork to stop SegWit because SegWit unintendedly disabled Bitmain's cheat in mining (Covert AsicBoost), which made them the number one in the market. The second group wanted Ethereum to be the king of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin was in their way. There might be other Bitcoin haters, such as bankers, but their identities are hard to confirm. The second group and the rest promoted blocksize increase hardfork because 1) hardforks were inherently risky and could be easily attacked; 2) SegWit fixed some fundamental development-stalling bugs in Bitcoin. All these people disguised themselves as "Bitcoiners with different opinions".
For a period of time, these people spammed rBitcoin. They did it with lies and misinformations. The mods did their job and stopped them. When their operations got hard, Roger Ver, who was an early Bitcoin adopter (bitcoin dot com owner) but believed to have become a secret Ethereum stakeholder thus Bitcoin hater later, created rBTC sub in the name of free speech. They claimed rBitcoin was censored and theirs wasn't. However, although they didn't delete the posts they didn't like, they used downvoting to hide them. They claimed rBitcoin banned "Bitcoiners with different opinions" and they didn't, but they actually did. With these configurations, rBTC became the nest of them all.
Before Bcash fork, rBTC sub pretended to talk about Bitcoin while spreading lies and misinformations, such as that Bitcoin development is controlled by evil Blockstream and Blockstream wanted SegWit.
Then an epic battle in the community happened. SegWit was activated. Bcash forked at the same time. Bitmain moved lots of their resources to Bcash. But the company saw Bcash as not Bitcoin. With SegWit activated and Bitmain moving on, altcoiners and other haters lost their focus for a while. They eventually came up with a new plan, which was to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, both figuratively and literally, and the idea that there could be many Bitcoin. This is mainly what they do now.
It's worth noting that there aren't many Bcash supporters in rBTC. They pretend to support it in order to undetermine Bitcoin.
TLDR: rBTC was created by a Bitcoin hater (altcoiner); was filled with Bitcoin cheaters (miner's shills) and Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on); is filled with Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on).

Since SegWit transactions are not larger, the only reason the blocks are larger is there are more transactions. You are against passing SegWit at this stage. It means you are against blocks having more transactions. Why?
There are two reasons blocks have more transactions: 1) genuine use; 2) spamming. I reckon we should accept 1) because it's why we make the effective block size limit larger. So I concluded that the reason you were against pushing SegWit was because of 2). But on second thought, spammers can adopt SegWit autonomously to make blocks larger. I'm lost.

As some quick signs,
1. Bcash uses 99.9% Bitcoin's code and you are asking why Bitcoin, as a technology, is superior to Bcash.
2. The method used in Bcash can be thought of by a five-year-old. "What do we do if we run out of space?" "We make the space bigger!" On the other hand, the methods used in Bitcoin require a Master or more advanced degree in Computer Science, or equivalent intelligence and efforts.

You got it right partially. Yes, *if* people deem altcoins as legit as Bitcoin as money, having altcoins is inflation. But you miss out the "if".
In fact, besides altcoiners who pump and dump to earn profits, the haters of Bitcoin for it being a deflationary currency advocate altcoins for the purpose of trivializing Bitcoin as well as causing inflation in cryptocurrencies as a whole.
This is why true Bitcoiners only recognize Bitcoin. This is why true Bitcoiners keep educating newcomers that only Bitcoin matters.
In addition, banks may find a way to trick people into using their custodial services, and, by doing so, they may be able to use fractional reserve to inflate "Bitcoin" (only for the people in the same services). This is why managing your own keys/coins is so important.

Having an official site doesn't make it centralized. It's for information only. It can be changed.
Bitcoin is designed to be decentralized, but the mining is centralized at the moment and may never be decentralized again. There is a fine line between a wish and a reality. Perfection is hard to get in reality. My point is that it has to be practical.

Can anyone explain to me what made him change from caring about children and being disgusted by what the government does to them to the current him?
I can't. So I came up with a theory.
Some resourceful party, e.g., a bank, set Roger up in a massive business or trading trap a long time. He lost more BTC/money than he owned. He then got threatened, maybe even with jail time and/or safety of him or his family, to become the current him.
In that case, he is in great debt - not rich at all. His current money is allowed to be kept or provided by this party for his operation.
In addition, this party is behind Vitalik/Ethereum, too. Both works together to destroy Bitcoin. This explains pretty much everything I can think of about Roger's otherwise-hard-to-explain behaviors, including that he claims Bcash is Bitcoin while Jihan insists Bcash isn't Bitcoin. Unlike said by many, there are many signs that he works *with* Jihan, not *for* him. His behaviors are not always aligned with Jihan, but are always aligned (not conflicting) with Vitalik.
Any argument is welcome. Would like to be proved wrong.

13% of the nodes forced a change that wasn't going to happen, at all.
I don't need any stats. You need to use you brain. Or you are a Bitcoin hater in disguise, no matter what say.


That "minority" hashrate would have activated USAF without 2x, or any miner joined in 2x. If there were no 2x, SegWit would have been activated about 3 months ago (instead of late last year with 2x). The fact is: we don't need 2x to have SegWit; we would have SegWit anyway. And that's inarguable.


And why did they fork off? Were they afraid of something? What was the thing that they were afraid of? Hint: they forked off at the exact same time as the activation time of UASF.
By the way, Bitcoin haters call Bcash BCH because they want to mislead newcomers to believe that Bcash is Bitcoin but calling it otherwise will make it clear that it is not Bitcoin, even if they call it "Bitcoin Cash".


You are deadly wrong. The truth is: The majority of nodes didn't *disagree* with UASF. All of them are OK with UASF nodes because it's a soft fork, which is backward compatible. That's why Bitcoin has been upgraded with soft forks only. That's why hard forks, which Bitcoin attackers keep pushing, should be avoided whenever possible.


You are double deadly wrong. If the majority didn't agree, why did UASFers get exactly what they (we) want? Nothing more, nothing less. And that, again, is inarguable.

Technically speaking, you can prove someone is not Satoshi by proving someone else is (and they don't have connections).
@_date: 2019-06-15 22:57:27
An input transaction, or a transaction input, is the source of BTC, i.e., where the BTC comes from. Similarly, an output transaction, or a transaction output, is the target of BTC, i.e., where the BTC goes to. The former is spent. The latter is unspent if it does not appear in any later transaction as an input. All BTCs reside in Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO). Technically, BTCs don't exist in addresses. When BTCs are spent, it's the UTXOs that are used. Any address can have any number of UTXOs (and any number of Spent Transaction Outputs).


I don't think it makes sense. My first guess is it's the *average* number of inputs being 2. When the BTC in one input is not enough, 2 or more are used. It averages out as 2. My second guess is it's the default number of transaction *outputs* being 2 - one being the receiving address, the other being the change address.

The receiver can replay the transaction you sign for B2X on BTC and get your BTC coins.
Replay attack is a problem only when you transact to other people.
There is no such thing as "private signature". In addition, your private key is not exposed when you sign a transaction, only the public key.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:26:24
No, it *is* consensus. Every node runs such code and everyone agrees.
Copying your logic: There was a consensus that Bitcoin has 21M coin limit. Due to rising requests there *is* no consensus anymore. We will hard-fork Bitcoin removing the limit and the fork will be Bitcoin.

Bcash doesn't solve any problem *of Bitcoin*. It forked off and is an altcoin. It's irrelevant to Bitcoin. Its low fee is simply because there is no users. It is literately not different from any other altcoin, except it has only disadvantages. All altcoins have low fees because there is not many users.

A node drops any invalid block, resulting it not to be relayed to other nodes. Since all nodes run the same code, only valid (to all nodes) blocks can exist and move in Bitcoin network. Invalid blocks hitting any node are removed by the node. This is how the consensus rules are enforced.

Paper wallet is an outdated technique. HD wallet is actually paper (because the only backup you need is paper) and superior in every way.
You don't have to go with a hardware wallet unless you are going to use BTC frequently, or you have to use BTC in plug-and-spend manner. I recommend offline Electrum on a Live CD/USB. It's reasonably secure.

Cobra is one of the co-owners/managers of bitcoin.org. It's suspected/believed that he was compromised some time after Bcash was created. He advocated hard forks, defamed Blockstream implicatively, defamed Halong Mining, and praised Bcash. Basically everything he said was against Bitcoin, but in a relatively non-obvious way.

If you come out directly against Bitcoin, you will lose your credit immediately and certainly. That's why you're strategy is not to be obvious.
You don't own bitcoin.org alone. That's why you can't promote Bcash on it.
The way you talked negatively about Blockstream is very similar to the narratives used by Bitcoin haters. You called Halong Mining a scam all along while respected figures in Bitcoin advocated it, and when people were showing evidence that it's real.
You advocated a PoW change in the name of helping decentralization of mining, but you have never made up for the damages you had some to Halong Mining, who brought the new hope of mining decentralization into Bitcoin.

Not license, but everything in Bitcoin when you acquire your BTC, including all the consensus rules. Everything.
The developer's who fork Core are bond to the license. If the client they make violates the license, your coin on that fork may be illegal, but this is not what I'm talking about.

@_date: 2017-11-08 05:09:56
Because there is no consensus for the merge. Many users want the current protocol. Many businesses, developers and even some miners want the current protocol too. It's because we know 2x is wrong. Core don't have much power when it comes to the consensus.
Hard-forks in general require a long time to prepare, and a lot of efforts to cooperate. You can't simply set a date and go.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:08:40


1. There is another way: by having an official site of Bitcoin.
2. There is no consensus. Roger claims Bcash is Bitcoin.


If there is an official site, the protocol can improve.


My point is: if everyone gets to decide, more than one Bitcoin can exist; then we fight to make sure only one Bitcoin exists. Why do we do this? Why don't we choose an easier path, by having an official site, which is created by the creator of Bitcoin himself, and keep it checked? We can announce the official site is changed if it's compromised.

Claiming forked coins, such as Bcash, comes with risks. Not saying that OP shouldn't do it, but getting education prior to proceeding is necessary.
In a nutshell, this is how you claim forked coins safely: 1) move BTC to new addresses of yours; 2) import old private keys to forked coin wallets, such as Electron Cash; 3) move forked coins to an exchange to sell. Be careful not to send BTC to BCH addresses, and vice versa. But make sure to read an authoritative article about it.

Does Copay have a desktop version?
Since you are looking into paper wallet, I assume you want a cold wallet to hodl for a long time. In that case, mobile wallet isn't a good idea.
For desktop, I recommend Electrum on Linux. Use a Live Linux USB/DVD, e.g., Tails, and offline Electrum. Don't use Windows. Note that Electrum uses its own seed scheme by default. You have to specify BIP39 in the option when creating the wallet. The beauty of an offline Electrum is that you can spend BTC securely while keeping it cold. Being able to use multisig is another plus. A 2-of-2 multisig on two separate offline computers provides enormously better security than standard (single-sig) offline Electrum, which is already very secure.
In addition, check  It has a wallet section. Most wallets support BIP39/BIP44.

It is hard coded. I'm not arguing about that. I'm saying since it's the Genesis block, it should be intended to demonstrate how it works. It should conform to the rules. The previous block's hash can be set arbitrarily, but the nonce should be mined. But that's my speculation. Are you sure it was not minded, namely, the nonce was not bruteforced? It could be done by a separate program.
Edit: I recalled that the Genesis block's nonce exceeds the difficulty requirement by a distance.

I had intensive thoughts about embedding pool functionality into Bitcoin protocol in order to resolve mining centralization. Check [Aggregated Mining] ( for details. In theory, it resolves many, if not most, noteworthy issues in Bitcoin, such as spamming, block time variance, 51% attack requiring less than 50% hash power (but not 51% attack), and so on, but also comes with major shortcomings, such as requiring a hard-fork, increased orphan blocks, increased block verification time, and so on.
I don't think there can be any viable solution to 51% attack under current PoW criteria. I believe something must be changed so that 51% attack can be withstood. I had some preliminarily ideas, but it's far from complete and requires knowledge/skills that I don't possess.

In fact, they are scared Bitcoin hitting 10k will trigger mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:23:32


I'll give you the benefit of doubt.


There are a few reasons. The fundamental one is the discrepancy of the network. Transactions are sent from all over the world. Since the speed of the network is limited, every node consequently has a different transaction set. There can't be a universally agreed-upon block, or whatever the data structure is used, at any given time. In addition to (and based on) that, there can be an adversary use of the discrepancy: double-spend, which is the key problem for decentralized money systems to resolve. Precursors of Bitcoin all failed in resolving it without introducing centralized parties. Mining resolves the problem decentralizedly. This is not to say it's completely impossible to have a decentralized money system with nodes only, but it's how Bitcoin does it.


The to-be-mined transaction pool, aka mempool. They are also removed from circulation (being relayed).


The rules of Bitcoin started from the first version of Bitcoin client and the Genesis block, which are created by Satoshi himself. The rules haven't been changed. That's why the current Bitcoin is the original Bitcoin. Anyone can setup a node running different consensus rules. It's just not Bitcoin. Those nodes can have their consensus rules. It's just that Bitcoin doesn't care.


It is possible, I suppose, but what's the point? If you don't care about other networks, why would you care to help them especially since it comes with costs, e.g., bandwidth, electricity, and so on?
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:18:42

Miners get block rewards, which are independent from users.
LN transactions still need to be settled on the blockchain in the end, which will give miners transaction fees. More importantly, users have the right to use their money however way they see fit.

Announcement of termination of Bcash in a few years:
Bitcoin ~~Classic~~ *Cash* Closing its doors
Bitcoin ~~Classic~~ *Cash* was started in ~~early 2016~~ *August 2017* with the clear intention of coming back to the coin that Satoshi indicated as his goal. Now this goal has been reached we will step down.
When ~~Classic~~ *Cash* started, the decision was to go for the lowest possible upgrade from 1 MB to 2 MB. It would avoid any technical complications and would lower the bar so far that we could not logically go any lower. It was the last, best, offer for peace.
Over the next 2 years a lot has happened. A lot of very competent people have attempted to do what ~~Classic~~ *Cash* attempted. With grander and fairer offers and still ultimately the lowest demand for growth. And all failed to move the Legacy Bitcoin chain towards a scaling solution. Any scaling solution! With the ~~New York~~ *Chicago* agreement failing just this week, we can be certain that the people that control the Bitcoin Legacy chain would rather go down with their ship.
I called it the "Bitcoin Legacy" chain because of its inability to allow growth and the chains heavy divergence from the Satoshi vision.
Bitcoin ~~Cash~~ *Gem*
~~Classic~~ *Cash* was right there on the front line when the Bitcoin ~~Cash~~ *Gem* chain started, having the most up-to-date releases (8 releases in 2 months) and the best and easiest migration strategies for users to sell their Legacy coin for ~~Cash~~ *Gem* coin.
The fact that the Legacy chain is stuck at 1 MB, and likely always will be, confirms the ~~Cash~~*Gem* chain's viability. (more). Now the market will decide.
And that means that ~~Classic~~ *Cash* has fulfilled its promise. It is now up to you which chain will gain the most traction. It is now up to the next billion people to start to use Bitcoin ~~Cash~~ *Gem*. In at most 6 months I'm sure we'll just drop the "~~Cash~~ *Gem*" and call it "Bitcoin".
People that run Bitcoin ~~Classic~~ *Cash* are urged to migrate to any of the alternative wallets or nodes. And I am serious about this because the recent versions of Bitcoin ~~Classic~~ *Cash* will stop following the main chain in a matter of days or weeks. Please don't get caught by surprise.

Firstly, there is not just one type of people in Bitcoin. Just because there is a lot of voices from holdlers doesn't mean everyone is a holdler. Some are investors. Some are speculators. Some are pump-and-dumpers (market manipulators).
Secondly, IMO, hodlers are investors, just very long term ones. They are going to sell Bitcoin, after hodling through rough waters. Hodling is not the ultimate form of Bitcoiners. The ultimate form is total abandoning of fiat, living on Bitcoin, and never caring about fiat anymore. Few are of this form.

All your points are based on high transaction fees, i.e., congested blocks. This is a key attack point of enemies of Bitcoin, which is easily and have been debunked many many times, with data. As a quick example, take a look at the mempool *right now*. Is it congested at all? (It's spammed in order for miners to earn high fees as well as serve as point to attack Core, in case any reader wants to know.)
You also fail to understand one simple principle in Bitcoin: hard-forks requires consensus. Even if majority users want a hard-fork, it can NOT go through *as Bitcoin*. It has to be "overwhelming majority", which is Satoshi's wording, at least. Does it remotely look like we have an overwhelming majority supporting a direct blocksize limit increase?
@_date: 2019-12-29 14:31:00
You are talking about BIP39.
Strictly speaking, there are three terms in BIP39: mnemonic, passphrase, and seed.
- The mnemonic refers to 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 words from a predefined list consisting of 2048 words. You can't choose words that are not in the list. And the last word contains a checksum therefore can't be freely chosen from the list. Other words can be chosen freely from the list.
- The passphrase refers to a string of text that is used alongside the mnemonic to generate the seed. You can choose the passphrase freely. And one mnemonic can have however many passphrases, each generating a separate account.
- The seed is basically the master private key, which is the root of all your keys/addresses. It's generated from the mnemonic and the passphrase, if applicable. It's in binary (non-human-readable) form.
Non-strictly speaking, the mnemonic is often called the seed words.
"Seed phrase" is a misnomer.

Transactions can be invalid, too, if they are based on different rules.
Blocks can be rejected, too.


What's the difference? They are removed from the memory of the said node.


I'm guessing you are struggling with the wording of "enforcing". I agree it's a little confusing. Maybe "defining" is better.


True, limited to themselves and the network with the same rules. It has no effect on nodes having different rules. On the other hand, there are all sorts of software running on the internet. Hardly does any computer have any power on what others receive/do, unless they run the same protocol.

Non-mining nodes are user nodes. A user's node that verifies transactions for the user is the guardian angel of the user. Mining nodes are worker nodes. They are valueless unless they follow user nodes.

Cash is not backed by gold. Cash printing is beyond your control. It's controlled by central bankers, who are private bankers, in order to steal money (in the sense of making it less valuable) from people. Bitcoin creation is within your power as long as you run your node. No one can make your Bitcoin less valuable.

Coinbase and all other DCG companies are owned and run by banksters, which Bitcoin is created to destroy. Think about that. Think about why they are in Bitcoin.

And centralizing Bitcoin is the only way to destroy it.)

No, you are wrong. Educate yourself.
1. The whitepaper is outdated. Miners and nodes are separate now.
2. Transactions don't need consensus amongst miners. Miners dictate whatever transactions to include and in whatever order they like. It doesn't require consensus. Of course the transactions and the blocks must conform to the consensus rules.

B2X is an attack on Bitcoin. If it disable Bitcoin, a PoW change hard-fork will have consensus therefore the new chain *is* Bitcoin.

There are two concerns when it's comes to security with closed-source elements: unintended vulnerabilities and intended backdoors.
On the backdoors side:
STM32 is some general purpose chips that exist for a long time. If there are backdoors, they must be general and not designed to target private keys of Bitcoin. And even if the manufacturer knows that the next batch of the chips are to be provided for hardware wallet, it's hard to make a backdoor targeting the sensitive data because the memory range is big.
A secure element, however, protects 16 private keys only. Backdoors can be easily built to leak the sensitive information because the size of the data is small and you know exactly where they are.
On the vulnerabilities side, both are not secure because of lack of reviews. However, a hacker would know where to look for the vulnerability in secure element, while there is nowhere specific for a hacker to look in STM32. And it makes secure element more vulnerable.
It's true that it's not ideal to use a closed source STM32, but the risk is minimal. It's similar to using a computer. You don't normally worry about leaks of sensitive data because of the closed source elements, such as the CPU. But the risk with secure element is big.

There are two types of protocol changes: soft-fork and hard-fork.
Soft-forks tighten the rules. Old unupgraded nodes deem the blocks following new rules legit. As a result, soft-forks are of low risk and easy to deploy.
Hard-forks either loose or change rules. Old unupgraded nodes deem the blocks following new rules illegitimate. Without every single node on the network upgrading, there will be a chain split. It's why hard-forks require consensus. As a result, hard-forks are hard to deploy and risky.

In addition, this type of transaction (Pay to IP address) used Pay to Public Key (P2PK), instead of more commonly used Pay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH).
Besides Pay to IP address, P2PK is used by some coinbase transactions (block rewards).
The support for Pay to IP address is removed.
Spending of P2PK coins (UTXOs) is still supported, but receiving to P2PK is made non-standard and subsequently not get relayed by regular nodes.
P2PK can be used to create multi-sig. In this case, the sender pays for the security of the receiver.

In that case, he would have to believe Core's approach is as wrong as the government that disgusted him. I don't think that's reasonable.
Think about this: how bad is it to not increase the blocksize limit directly right now if SegWit won't help? Yes, it will delay the direct increase of the blocksize a few years. Is it that evil? Will Bitcoin stop working without the direct blocksize increase? There are high fees, from time to time. They slow down the adoption. But the adoption is happening. More and more people get to know and involved in Bitcoin. The price keeps rising. Is Core really that evil?

Bitcoin can do 0-conf, too. It's just copied code. Keep in mind Bcash uses 99% of Bitcoin's code.

Not sure if I understand it correctly. Are you saying Roger's motives behind his behaviors are simply pump-and-dump, internal trading, scamming kind of quick/short-term profits?
Roger has a long history of supporting contentious hard forks. Do you think it plays well with your theory?
Rbtc supporting SegWit2x can be explained as they saw the inevitability of SegWit being activated.
Roger did support Bcash when it was created, just not to the same level as he does now. I think he didn't go all in on Bcash because it was factually a hard fork from Bitcoin, and the creator himself (Jihan) admitted it wasn't Bitcoin. It would be impossible for him to sell Bcash as Bitcoin at that time. That's when SegWit2x was still hopeful. When SegWit2x failed, he had no choice but to go all in and support Bcash. He certainly would support BSV, too. Of course this is based on the assumption that he is against Bitcoin (an altcoiner).

The fact that you quote Satoshi shows how little you know about software engineering, or product development in general. No one can be sure how things will turn out eventually. Satoshi wasn't even sure Bitcoin would work at the beginning. Otherwise he wouldn't have asked opinions from the community.

For example, [Samsung 950 Pro 512GB drive has a TBW of 400TB, while popular older drives such as the 850 EVO had 150TB.]( Some SSDs nowadays have over perabytes of TBW (Terabytes Written).

No, you have admitted (again) all your can do is to pretend you didn't see everything you cannot refute.
Now, Bcash. You must feel relieved when I referred to it because you finally had some scripts that you could use.
You have not had Bitcoin, but I'll pretend you have, just like I pretended you were asking a genuine question.
You agreed on Bitcoin having a hard block size as 1MB and there was no promise whatsoever of changes on that the moment you joined Bitcoin. Because that's the protocol of Bitcoin that's written in code and enforced by nodes. Same applies to every person who is calling for hard block size increase at the moment (your colleagues), by the way. SegWit is a soft fork. As a nature of soft forks, it conforms to every existing rule/agreement/protocol of Bitcoin. That's why old Bitcoin clients don't have to upgrade and Bitcoin still works. The current Bitcoin client is doing strictly the same things as when you signed up Bitcoin as far as the protocol concerns. Now you want something that's different than the agreements. And when other people in the same agreements want to stick to the old agreements, you call us forcing you. No, no one forced you. No one forced to get into Bitcoin in the first place. No one forced you to accept 1MB hard block size limit the moment you joined Bitcoin. You want something that's not in the agreements, you go find it somewhere else. Apparently you have found it - Bcash. But you are back. *You* are forcing us to turn Bitcoin into non-Bitcoin now.

They will help, as "small blockers" all agree. But doing them before proper improvements are explored will not. Doing them now will destroy Bitcoin.


It alone is not. It is one of the many improvements that will help with the situation. And there may not be a solution after all. We may have to endure such congestions from time to time, even after we roll out hard block size increases eventually. We may have to show Bitcoin's enemies that we *will* survive such attacks and we will not shoot ourselves by using hard block size increases whenever there is a congestion. Because we understand 1) block congestion is merely an inconvenience; 2) spamming is not sustainable.
Exploring proper improvements earn Bitcoin time to allow computer technologies to develop, for hardware to become cheaper and better, so that people will still afford to run nodes when we have to use hard block size increases eventually.


Because proper improvements like Schnorr signature don't threat Bitcoin's survivability. The ability/affordability of nodes is essential for Bitcoin to survive. Block congestion is a problem of a different, and much less significant level.
In fact, survivability is an understatement. In a peer-to-peer system, everyone is supposed to run a peer. Bitcoin has already failed on this matter. We don't want to make it worse.


I don't see how hard it is to understand. Just because someone seems to be nice to you, you will allow them to, in an indirect way that you are aware of, hurt you?


There are researches but I don't think we can possibly be certain. The spammers would know better. But we know for sure a lot of transactions during congestions are spam. If not, if all transactions are organic, the blocks will constantly be full.


The problem with using hard block size increases *now* is not that it's not a perfect solution. It's because it's a perfect way to destroy Bitcoin.


It should, just like "small blockers" all agree. It's the timing of using it. It is how things are done properly. We don't wave a hammer on a fragile object when carefully manipulating is still possible and promising.

I've got some questions about compressed public hey.
Is it a thing of asymmetric cryptography in general, or Bitcoin only?
Is there any gain by using it instead of uncompressed public key besides that it uses less memory (33 bytes versus 65 bytes)? Does it result in smaller addresses (and subsequently smaller block usage)?
Why must SegWit use compressed public key?
Why are 0x02 or 0x03 added onto compressed public key, and why is 0x04 added onto uncompressed public key?
Is there a problem to simply use the (unmodified) first EC point, for example, as the public key if everyone agrees so?

And banks are privately owned. Banker means bank owner.


You think this kind of diversion will work?


The bank owner owns 50% of the money/wealth/natural resources/companies/etc.


Central banks print money through increasing money supply. Commercial banks print money through fractional reserve. Print means create. Most money is in digital form so print is just an old saying commonly used.


Like "Give me controlof a nation's money and I care not who makes the laws." that kind of control? Are central banks controlled?


True, it's called fractional reserve. It means banks can loan out money that they don't own and does not exist, creating money out of thin air. Interestingly, the money created from thin air and loaned out mostly come back to the banks, resulting in more nonexistent money from being created from thin air.

No, the "hard fork" is not caused by not raising it. People fork Bitcoin's code and sometimes the chain as well all the time. But all of them occur because they want something different than what Bitcoin is. That's not a problem of Bitcoin. They are not hard forks of Bitcoin.

1. Monero is no one. It doesn't threat anyone who is currently rich and powerful. No one will spam it just to bloat its blocks in order to centralize it and shut it down. (The only way to destroy a P2P/decentralized system is to centralize it.)
2. Monero is not at Bitcoin's scale. Things work at lower scales oftentimes don't work at higher scales.
3. There are many issues with Monero's dynamic block size. I'm no expert, but it relies on miners being benign, which is the opposite to Bitcoin's design principle, which assumes everyone can be hostile. It is known that Monero's block size can be attacked (bloated).

There are some logical fallacies in the article even if Craig is actually Satoshi and has the evidence.
The problem is that all the proofs he had presented were invalid and many were evidently fake (based on the information provided by the community). It's because of such a fact that some people have concluded that he is not Satoshi and is a fraud. That's totally reasonable.
Whether Craig can/will prove with evidence that he is Satoshi has totally no impact on the reasonableness of people calling him not Satoshi and a fraud based on the proofs he had presented. This is what the article fails at.

The central bank is only one source of inflation. The second bigger one is by commercial banks, through fractional reserve. If reserve rate is 10%, 9 times of real money is created out of thin air. Why does the banks want fractional reserve? Because banks cannot lend out money to earn interests. Banks earning interests is the root of fractional reserve, and the inflation caused by it.
By lending money to banks, you are helping the whole system, including helping it to enslave you. The interests you can possibly earn from the system cannot possibly be more than or even close to the interests the banks earn.

There is no cryptocurrency good (efficient, secure, tested at big scale at least) enough with features that Bitcoin doesn't/can't have at this stage. Altcoins with significant prices are overly speculated not-yet-fully-tested genuine technology development attempts at best, and upfront scamcoins at worst. And most are the latter. Bitcoin is the only one holding the true value.
In the long run, new technologies good enough and having features that Bitcoin can't have may occur. In that case, Bitcoin may not be the only one holding true values. However, whether such a technology exists is unknown.

I don't get what you saying.
Rules enforced by UASF nodes are compatible with old rules. Blocks accepted by UASF nodes can be accepted by nodes running official Core if the chain has most work. As a result, running official Core does not necessarily oppose UASF. It all depends on hash rate.
More importantly, running official Core is enforcing the original Bitcoin's rules nonetheless. Telling Bitcoiners without a clue about UASF to stick to Bitcoin is both appropriate and moral. UASFers doing so were not trying to confuse or use users. That's why it's a gesture of honesty and integrity.

You are lost in logic. Let me help you here: You quoted Satoshi to say that hard block size increase is not an attack. I refuted it by telling you no one knows for sure and can be wrong at the beginning. Then you said we do know, but referring to a totally different issue. And when I questioned you, you are now saying what you just said.
Ironically, you are wrong. Hard block size increase is both risky and harmful. You just need a little intelligence to understand that.
Let me guess, Blockstream benefits from small blocks, right? I know everything you have to say. I've experienced all.
What companies benefit from big blocks? All miners. But as I have pointed out, which you happened to have overlooked, as you overlooked every point that refutes you, the bigger problem with hard block size increase is it's a way to destroy Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has no roadmap, just like Linux. However, Greg Maxwell, a key Core developer, had a write-up about hard block size increase. Look it up on bitcoincore.org. Again, stop the lies.

I believe Bitcoin is decentralized and it is extractly why a Bitcoin Core version with a hard fork of block size increase will not be adopted by users because we know, in that case, Core developers are compromised. This is of course assuming such a version will ever exist, which is impossible.
A hard fork to increase the block size will happen, just not now, not in the foreseeable future, not before all other safer options are explored and integrated, and it's a consensus in the technical community, including Core developers. Asking for a block size increase hard fork before exhausting all other options is an attack on Bitcoin.

Firstly, there is no "official" in Bitcoin. No one person, one group of people, one organization can represent Bitcoin or decide for Bitcoin. The users as a whole decentralizedly decide for Bitcoin.
Secondly, there is a saying: Bitcoin has no roadmap. It's so because it's believed the practice has been proved great by the development of Linux.
Thirdly, there is no agreement about "in steps of" 2, 4, 8MB. It says "*such as* 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase". It's an example, and the detailed implementation is not even discussed.
Other than that, I believe we agree with each other.

2017 is a big win of Bitcoin. We defended Bitcoin from an organized hostile takeover. At the end, even those who claimed to be firmly against the update joined to support its activation and continuously mine upgraded Bitcoin.


Collectiveness does not trample personal rights. Bitcoin is a consensus based software, and it's such software about money. People have agreements. Hard forks are incompatible changes, which are changes of agreements. To integrate an incompatible change, everyone must agree on it. Otherwise the network will split, impairing the fundamental value of the software/network. Just because some people didn't support the change of the agreements doesn't mean the community as a whole failed. SegWit is a soft fork. Everything in it conformed to the old protocol/agreements, which everyone had agreed on. There is no changes of agreements. Bitcoin worked perfectly collectively when some people supported the soft fork (SegWit) and it went through, and some people rejected the hard fork (for a block size increase) and it didn't go through.
LN is not the only scaling solution. There are quite a few other soft fork solutions they can help with scaling while having other benefits. On the other hand, hard block size increase does not.


LN is being actively developed. Bitcoin itself is software far from feature-completed thus is not ready, if you refer to being developed as not ready.
On the other hand, contrary to some people's belief, hard block size increase is not ready from many aspects:
1. The solution is not ready. In fact, it's far from being ready. Contrary to some people's belief, hard block size increase isn't a change of one variable/constant. Hard forks are inherently risky and should be avoided if possible, and, if it's impossible, they should be limited to as few times as possible. A sophisticated solution that can dynamically adjust/increase the block size over time needs be devised before being put into action. I may be wrong, but I don't think there is one currently available, not even one that's promising. In addition, since Bitcoin has never had a hard fork for protocol changes, researches may need to be done to make sure the transition is as smooth/safe as possible.
2. The community is not ready. In fact, it's far from being ready. Hard forks require consensus. Everyone has to agree, which is far from the reality. There are quite a few soft fork scaling solutions being researched/developed. Many Bitcoiners will not accept hard fork solutions before these soft fork ones are exhausted. Not to mention the belief that hard block size increase is inefficient (being linear). Without everyone being on the same page, it simply will not happen, just like 2017.
3. Hardware is not ready. In order for any P2P software to survive and be robust, as many peers as possible should be run. Bitcoin nodes are already too expensive to run for many. Given time, hardware will become better and cheaper (Moore's law, as many "big blockers" often refer to).
If we are lucky, within a few years, all existing soft fork solutions will be integrated, LN and potentially other layer 2 solutions will be used extensively, and the hard block size increase solution will be ready. That will be the time we check whether there is absolute need of the hard block size increase. There is not such need at the moment, by the way.
When we are sure that we need the hard block size increase, it will then be carried out. Contrary to some people's belief, it will not just happen. It will take months if not years for the community to communicate and organize the software update because it's incompatible to old versions and can cause chain split. Bitcoin is not Ethereum. No one owns the trademark of Bitcoin. We can't hard fork and force other people to accept the new chain is Bitcoin.


Since never. Attacks on Bitcoin disguised as genuine opinions appear quite regularly in this sub. It never fails that topics about hard block size increase appear whenever there is a block congestion. Interestingly, they oftentimes claim it's a taboo to speak technology in this sub.

Since it's likely Satoshi is a group, we should stop assuming and calling any one person Satoshi. Unless Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin as we know it, is one person, which we will likely never be able to know or be sure, it's *they* and they would not be able to prove "himself".
That leads to anther question: if one comes forward and try to "prove" himself is Satoshi, what proofs would suffice? Probably no proofs would suffice, no matter if he claims Satoshi is a single individual or a group. Signing with the genesis address would not suffice because the key (and the block) may be created by the group altogether, may be shared in the group after created by one of them (for bookkeeping for example), and may be given to another member for some reason (because quitting for example). The same probably can be said to any other proofs.

Right, sometimes I'm too literal and sometimes I'm too figurative.
Your whole point is that Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme, he is trying to steal money from naive investors, and Wink brothers are trying to steal money from naive investors. And my point is that you have failed in doing that.
It's extremely inefficient to cheat anyone while being here (in this sub) because few comes here for Bitcoin investment opinions. It's inefficient to cheat naive investors by establishing an ETF because naive investors are not more exposed or more vulnerable than anyone else when it comes to an ETF. Neither is remotely as efficient as running the classic ponzi scheme. Why don't they do that instead?

Bitcoin by design does not support charge back. If the transaction is mined, the money will be in the merchant's hand. The only way to get it back is that the merchant makes a transaction to you. It's something you have to communicate with the merchant.
If you decide to cancel a purchase before the transaction is mined, you can broadcast a new transaction spending the same BTC to an address you control, with a higher fee. Some miners may drop the old transaction and mine and new one because it's more profitable. Such scenario is called race attack and normally considered bad. However, there is the need to accelerate stuck transactions with low fees. The need is similar to yours. Some technologies are developed to solve the problem: Replace By Fee (RBF) and Child Pays For Parent (CPFP).
With RBF, the transaction has a flag indicating whether it's final, or in other words, whether a replaced fee in a replacement transaction in the future is possible. New transactions spending the same BTC can be created and accepted if the old one is not final and the fee of the new one is higher, until the final flag is set, in which case no new replacement transaction will be accepted. It's said some miners give non-final RBF transactions low priorities, though.
With CPFP, a new transaction (child) is created that spends the receiving address of the previous transaction (parent), which has not been mined. The new transaction has a high combined fee. Both transactions are included in the same block to be mined. When mined, only the address in the child transaction has BTC.
Both RBF and CPFP can be used to stop the BTC to be sent to the merchant, although RBF is probably more economic. Note that none of the three solutions (race attack, RBF and CPFP) guarantees the outcome. It depends on whether the original transactions is mined and if the miner will include the new transaction.

I think the article is the reason why Casa doesn't implement SSSS (because they have multisig), and shouldn't be read as SSSS should not be used in general.
Safety is different than security. Safety is about preventing loss by accidents or things that are not intended. Security is about dealing with intended attacks. SSSS is about safety, namely not losing funds by losing a piece of paper. Multisig is (more) about security, although it provides the same level of safety as SSSS. But multisig is more complicated and harder to use.

Blocksize increase itself is technically wrong. A hard-fork for it only gains problems, while coming with high risks.
SegWit is the right thing to do, which makes UASF a right thing to do. This is especially true when the blocking of SegWit is malicious. UASF is not only right, but also necessary.
A hard-fork for blocksize increase is a voluntary one. If chain split happens, it will greatly damage Bitcoin, because the consensus fails.
A chain split caused by UASF will not have consensus issue. People will be united, no matter if they follow Core or the malicious miners. In addition, the malicious miners will be removed from the system therefore Bitcoin will be restored to the normal healthy status, making future development/advancement lightning fast.
In other words, chain split is not optimal. But if it's to dump the malicious miners, it's worth it.

Isn't Ethereum DAO incident enough? I'm not informative when it comes to altcoins.
Hard forks that kill the less popular chains have ethical issues. I personally believe that there are also legal issues, which haven't been explored enough so far. Unless the name is owned, the unchanged chain/coin should (legally) be the original chain/coin therefore uses the original name, no matter how few people stay behind and how many people want the changed chain/coin to use the original name. But it is not practiced this way at the moment. Bitcoin's name, which is wanted by the attackers, isn't owned by anyone. This makes its hard-forks more problematic. Ethereum doesn't have this problem because the name is owned. Even so, the DAO incident created massive chaos. I don't know about Monero, but it's just too small compared with Bitcoin.
I don't think difficult adjustment time is relevant.

Mining helps with the decentralization of Bitcoin. Run the numbers. Make reasonable assumptions, including whether BTC price will go up or down (long-term or short-term, depending on how soon he expects the return), and by how much. If numbers are good, go for it.

The concept of being rushed is relevant to time. If there is 3 years of stagnation, I wouldn't call it rushed, either.
Your example isn't related to time. If a car example is time-related, e.g., "after 30 years of not being cared, the car can't be considered a car", it's not faulty, because the car deteriorates over time.
Unless we are talking about BIP148 being deployed and activated with rush. But GMaxwell's point is that BIP148 itself isn't good enough.

User activation activates permanent rule changes. Before and after it, the rules, which are universal, are automatically enforced. In addition, it is a one-time thing.
Emergent Consensus looses the rules so that it can be adjusted any time, to any value. The rules, which are locally different, are manually enforced, making it corruptible and breakable. In addition, it is a continuous thing. Every block is subject to consensus progress.

Users are customers and miners are suppliers. UASF practically stands for Customer Activated Product Changes. MASF practically stands for Supplier Activated Product Changes. In both cases, the product changes have already been agreed upon and ready. Specially, SegWit had already been agreed upon and ready.


UASFers did NOT encourage everyone to run UASF node software. In fact, it was encouraged that users who were not knowledgeable/informative enough did NOT run UASF node software.




It is clear UASF is a big thing to celebrate. It's the proof of users' power in deciding what they want. And it did set a precedent - a good one.


False. People choosing to run UASF know exactly what they want. It's perfectly safe for them. It may not be safe for other Bitcoin users, but no one is obliged to be bond to Bitcoin.


This has be debunked many times, with various reasons. I'll give just one here: SegWit had 33% hash rate support before UASF. UASF *would* succeed no matter what.


It did not need to. And it is another proof of how powerful users are in Bitcoin. And it never has to. Anyone can run any node software.


False. UASF node software was run by many UASFAers. People previously signaling uacomment looked for switching to UASF node software. The only reason that not all supporters switched to UASF node software was it worked so quickly.


False. UASF had supports from almost all major Core developers. They just disagreed on which solution to choose, BIP148  or BIP149.


It's because Core developers didn't agree with each other on which solution to choose. It makes a perfect sense Core did not merge UASF.


Another proof of the power of users, aka, costumers. The economy, the industry, and businesses, or whatever, appeal to customers. They emerge for customers. They kiss customers' asses.


And yet, literally 100% miners, including Bcash creator (Jihan) and proponents (such as Roger), followed the rules as it enforced. What does that tell you?


The fact that UASF succeeded is because customers get to decide what they want, and suppliers get to choose if they want to be in or out of business.


By saying that, are you implying you are more experienced and competent in billion-dollar businesses?


You seem to have a crystal ball. What's the brand of it?


Lie. It's MAHF. It's actually JAHF (Jihan Activated Hard Fork).




False. I can't speak for other people. I saw USAF chain an altcoin *with the potential of wiping out the original Bitcoin chain and becoming Bitcoin*.


Good point. Core didn't and cannot decide for users. Neither did or can miners.


False. Only hard forks need overwhelming consensus. Soft forks don't.


I don't think Earth is round. /s


You mean customers communicating with each other to protect their investment?
Your post, on the other hand, is a social media political campaigning.


No users are bond to Bitcoin. People are free to leave.






LOL. You just said "no miners". How can a radical minority change Bitcoin without miners?
 &gt;we need to re-think our attitude to the UASF and future UASF's.
We need to set a standard of UASF. Every soft fork since 2017 should use UASF (as a last resort).


Bitcoin is a much bigger disturbance than any soft forks of it. Maybe Bitcoin should only get created when the whole world is ready. /s


You *are* literally part of something - a customer, who has the right to decide what you want.


It's time we all accept that you will never succeed in taking users' power.

I had read the article of It's different than Luke's comment above, which says running official Core was opposing UASF.
Nonetheless, Luke's article was an attempt of educating users of UASF, which was honorable by the way. It didn't solve the problem that some people had difficulty understanding what's going on, or which side to choose, even after reading it. It was a big mess back then. Hence the PSA that advised people without a clue to not switch to UASF and to keep old node running.
It makes perfect sense to run your old node software in case of uncertainty. If people are advised to choose from node software without consensus when they are uncertain, they may get tricked into switching to a hostile node software. Sticking to the node software that has consensus is appropriate. BIP148 may be a special case, in which sticking to official Core is risky.

Can they do the followings?
The malware comes with the hacker's HD wallet master public key.
While victim's computer is idle, the malware grinds through all addresses derived from the master public key, saving potential candidates in a database.
When the malware discovers a BTC address in the clipboard, it looks into their address database and replace user's one with the best they have.
The hacker's computer computes the same database, monitors the addresses, and moves available BTC to another (normal and private) wallet.

Showing the keys may not prove anything. It just proves owning the keys.
Owning the keys doesn't necessarily means he is the first (original) owner of them. The keys may have been transferred to him.
Being the original owner doesn't necessarily mean the software is written by him. It just means he is the first one to run the software, which means he might be the project sponsor/buyer.
The software being written by him doesn't necessarily mean he invented the solution.
Bitcoin is likely invented/created by a group of people. Anyone in it may be able to show the keys. But no one alone can be Satoshi Nakamoto, who we refer to as the inventor/creator of Bitcoin. If we are to not be strict, the only person in the group who may be considered Satoshi Nakamoto should be the one who invented the solution, and he might not have the keys.

Every time I see a topic about having Core devs stay and talk with BU devs, I can't help to think how much could Core devs charge BU devs for the mentoring and consulting service. It's going to be very expensive since these guys are top notches.
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:15:00


The devs are the creator and the maintainer Bitcoin software. They keep Bitcoin healthy. They lead and advance Bitcoin. Without them, the community doesn't even exist. We don't hire or pay them. They have nothing to do with my definition.


In that case, a lesson will have been taught to them. They will know how to behave. If they misbehave again, which is unlikely, they will be fired/punished again.


If UASF is activated, the economic majority will treat the coin as Bitcoin. You can say whatever you want but it won't change a thing.


Anyone with a real understanding of what's going on in Bitcoin knows this is the right thing to do. There may be short-term pain. But in a medium and long run, it is super bullish, which is also why Bitcoin haters diligently propagate the badness of UASF - more diligently than their usual anti-Bitcoin operation, because they are scared.


HK agreement is SegWit first, then HF. In addition, with AsicBoost, do you really think miners will accept SegWit in any form?


A normal hard-fork has been propagated heavily by Bitcoin haters, most likely altcoiners, most likely Ethereum coin holders, who know clearly how messy and destructive a contentious hard-fork can be from their experience with Ethereum's DAO hard-fork. They know a blocksize hard-fork is contentious. That's why they have been trying to push it, as well as other hard-forks.
UASF is intended to activate SegWit, which will greatly benefit Bitcoin. This is users' best interest. The worst scenario chain split is not contentious. The risk is minimal.

@_date: 2019-04-25 12:36:50
Not exactly. It's about principles. Being driven by profits or even been greedy is OK as long as it does not cause harm.
SegWit2x was an attack on Bitcoin. The 2x part was a hard fork. There was no consensus for hard fork. The debate of it lasted a few years. Many people were strongly against it. Going forward would cause the chain to split. People pushing it (mainly miners) were forcing users to accept it. Basically only well-known bad actors fully supported it. Admittedly Ledger didn't support it to the same level as some other bad actors. But they'd shown that they put business opportunities before integrity.
Trezor/Slush did the opposite. Bcash shared the same mining algorithm with Bitcoin. At some stage, mining Bcash was more profitable than Bitcoin. Many miners moved to mine Bcash, causing massive drop of Bitcoin hash rate therefore the stability in Bitcoin network. Slush did not submit to the opportunity. They protected Bitcoin. They'd shown their integrity.
Now hardware wallet is about your money. All of it that's in it. What kind of company would you trust more?
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:59:55

The technique shown is a common one. It doesn't require special experience in mining. Given Core's competency, it's logic to ask such a question.

They can gain not only fame, but also experience, career opportunities, and so on. This is exactly how open source projects work: altruism plus personal improvements and indirect benefits. Because the benefits are indirect, the threat is low. (Other parties of Bitcoin have indirect benefits, too. The threats from them are low, too.)
In addition, because the whole idea about free software and open source is altruism, the devs tend to have high morality level, making them much less likely to be corrupted.
Lastly, if the devs are corrupted, the users can leave them by starting an altcoin, and look for new trusted devs for further development.
On the other hand, miners are from the commercial world where morality isn't a priority, at all. They are extremely easy to corrupt.


Why do you think users have to express their opinions via miners? There are many other ways.

Thanks for sharing. But this doesn't sound like a proper solution because it employs address reuse. It's actually why you said address reuse is common. It's not common, at least not with BIP39/BIP44 HD wallets. In addition, the need for backing up wallet data file defeats the purpose of paper wallets.

If your seed was generated in Electrum with the default seed settings, it is incompatible to most if not all other wallets.
If you specified BIP39 seed in the settings while generating the seed, it is compatible with most wallets and can be restored in any of them.

The support rate is BTC amount weighted. It can't Sybil attacked. It can be attacked by moving all BTC of the attackers around. But it's competing with economic majority, which is much richer than any miner. I assume Roger Ver and other attackers don't hold a lot of BTC. However, whether or not they will buy BTC in order to attack Bitcoin's advancement and how many BTC will/can they buy are unknown.
Edit: topo: rates -&gt; weighted

Miners have no power in Bitcoin. This is by design, and has been proved. They are proof-of-work service providers hired and paid by Bitcoin network. They can have wherever agreements, but if what they do don't conform to rules enforced by the Bitcoin nodes, their work will be wasted and they will not get paid.
Yes, everyone is free to build their Bitcoin client software and try to convince other people to run it. They can even fork the source code from Bitcoin Core and just modify it, saving tons of time. Whether their versions get accepted by users is a totally different matter. For example, Bcash (Bitcoin Cash) is a such a fork and it's propagated as Bitcoin by some rich and influential figures, but no one give a shit about it.
Calling Bitcoin Core a centralized group is like calling our science community a centralized group. It's an open community. How can it be centralized if it is not even closed?

With SSSS, you only need to construct once (to get the seed), and the daily use will be simple. With multisig, it requires multiple signature every time you use it.
Explaining multisig to non-technical savvy people may be challenging.
For a power user like yourself, multisig is probably not much more inconvenient than SSSS.

I understand that there might be coin moving races, which benefits miners. Miners may even purposely block the fork for some time even though they support it.
I'm hoping that the combined amount of BTC of Bitcoin attackers and miners is far lower than the combined amount of BTC of active economic majority and holders. If that's the case, coin moving races will likely not happen, because they know they are going to lose. We may even select the fork-supporting miners to move the coins, in order to prevent the intentional blocking for earning transaction fees. In that case, it will arguably be bribing. But again I'm hoping it won't be necessary.
Not saying that it will definitely work. I'm exploring the viability of the idea.
The idea of Loss of Stake sounds interesting.

The brief history of rBTC
When there was only rBitcoin subreddit, some people, in the name of scaling, were promoting blocksize increase hardfork and bashing softfork solution SegWit in rBitcoin. These people mainly fell into two groups, one being shills of Bitmain, the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world, the other being altcoiners, mainly Ethereum stakeholders. The first group promoted blocksize increase hardfork to stop SegWit because SegWit unintendedly disabled Bitmain's cheat in mining (Covert AsicBoost), which made them the number one in the market. The second group wanted Ethereum to be the king of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin was in their way. There might be other Bitcoin haters, such as bankers, but their identities are hard to confirm. The second group and the rest promoted blocksize increase hardfork because 1) hardforks were inherently risky and could be easily attacked; 2) SegWit fixed some fundamental development-stalling bugs in Bitcoin. All these people disguised themselves as "Bitcoiners with different opinions".
For a period of time, these people spammed rBitcoin. They did it with lies and misinformations. The mods did their job and stopped them. When their operations got hard, Roger Ver, who was an early Bitcoin adopter (bitcoin dot com owner) but believed to have become a secret Ethereum stakeholder thus Bitcoin hater later, created rBTC sub in the name of free speech. They claimed rBitcoin was censored and theirs wasn't. However, although they didn't delete the posts they didn't like, they used downvoting to hide them. They claimed rBitcoin banned "Bitcoiners with different opinions" and they didn't, but they actually did. With these configurations, rBTC became the nest of them all.
Before Bcash fork, rBTC sub pretended to talk about Bitcoin while spreading lies and misinformations, such as that Bitcoin development is controlled by evil Blockstream and Blockstream wanted SegWit.
Then an epic battle in the community happened. SegWit was activated. Bcash forked at the same time. Bitmain moved lots of their resources to Bcash. But the company saw Bcash as not Bitcoin. With SegWit activated and Bitmain moving on, altcoiners and other haters lost their focus for a while. They eventually came up with a new plan, which was to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, both figuratively and literally, and the idea that there could be many Bitcoin. This is mainly what they do now.
It's worth noting that there aren't many actual Bcash supporters in rBTC. They pretend to support it in order to undetermine Bitcoin.
TLDR: rBTC was created by a Bitcoin hater (altcoiner); was filled with Bitcoin cheaters (miner's shills) and Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on); is filled with Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on).

I can't think of a scenario that Bitcoin will fail *completely*.
People in Bitcoin are to exit the fiat/banking system scam. As long as it's technically viable, it will exist.
Vulnerabilities in cryptography used in Bitcoin can cause a massive impact, but switching to new algorithms should be able to fix the problem long-term.
Coordinated government ban (very unlikely to happen) can limit the activity of Bitcoin a lot, but will not eliminate Bitcoin completely.
The only way to completely ruin Bitcoin is that the community chooses a centralized path of its development and evolution, which has been proved impossible even when it is under siege. As is said, people in Bitcoin have a purpose.
Although unlikely, there is the possibility that Bitcoin "brand" gets hijacked. In that case, people in Bitcoin will move on to another cryptocurrency that carries the same propose, like what's happened in UASF in 2017. If you see Bitcoin as a movement, it will probably never fail.

And I've heard some CTO does the same. In fact, Nicholas Dorier does the same. I assume you code, too. I would take \u\jstolfi's opinions with a grind of salt.

I got it:
P(IsSatoshi): 1/7.5billion
P(BehavesLikeCsw | IsSatoshi): 0.8
P(BehavesLikeCsw): 0.096
Question: If someone behaves like CSW, what's the probability of him being Satoshi?
P(IsSatoshi | BehavesLikeCsw) = P(BehavesLikeCsw | IsSatoshi) * P(IsSatoshi) / P(BehavesLikeCsw)
= 0.8 * 1/7.5billion / 0.096
= 0.8 / 720million (your conclusion)
= 1 / 900million (your conclusion)
= 1.111/billion
OP was saying the odds that Satoshi behaves like CSW are slim, so it should be a small number instead of 0.8. But even if it's 0.8, the result is still extremely low, thus the point.
With that being said, is the logic perfectly correct? Your example doesn't clearly state this, but in the [drunk drivers example]( that provided, there is an assumption that "you don't know anything else about him or her." But in this case, we know something else about CSW. Should knowing something else about the selected object play a role in here?
In addition, does the following factor listed by OP play a role? It doesn't seem to be in the formula.

No, I didn't. The values of everyone's dollar goes down equally, with the banks get a lot new money. The reason why the value of everyone's money goes down is because the new money joins the old money in purchasing available goods and so on, driving prices up. As a result, banks get richer, people get poorer.
I'm going to ask you one more time. How come the super rich become even richer with the stimulation that comes from inflation?
In fact, there wasn't any super rich people 50~100 years ago. It's the concentration of money, which is caused by inflation in the first place, that created the super rich.

I believe you are referring to his statement that he regretted to be in the effort of proving CSW was Satoshi, which was interpreted by many to be that he withdrew his previous statement that CSW was Satoshi. But the interpretation was wrong. The statement simply meant he didn't know doing that thing would get himself into such a big trouble (he got attacked) and it was not worth it.

I guess I misunderstood your question then.
If the implementation is equally secure, the entropy that comes with good random passwords used as brain wallet to generate HD wallet should be roughly equal to the same entropy that comes with regular BIP39 HD wallet. The difference would be how the password and the seed are hardened. IIRC, BIP39 hardens the seed with 2048 rounds of PBKDF2. I don't know how Ian Coleman's BIP39 tool hardens the password and how many rounds are run. I imagine the difference shouldn't be too significant.
There are some caveats, though.
1. Some security experts, including Core developer Greg Maxwell, warn about any JavaScript-based implementation of security software. In other words, the implementation of Ian Coleman's BIP39 tool, which is JavaScript-based, may not be as secure as regular BIP39 HD wallet.
2. The password should not be created by you, or any human beings for that matter, because researches have shown that we humans are terrible at creating randomness. You must use a good random password generator. However, it would mean the password won't be a good brain wallet because it will be hard to remember.

Blocks are full because some big users, such as Coinbase, are wasting the space, while a better way of using it has been available for years. Blocks are full also because, sometimes, aliens, such as VeriBlock, waste the space. It's not Bitcoin's job to hold trashes for other people.
Blocks are sometimes full because of spammings. The spammings are not for profit. They are to make blocks full in order to push hard block size increase, which will destroy Bitcoin.
My personal reason? It's clear that pushing hard block size increase is an attack on Bitcoin. It's clear that all the narratives are lies. And I'm not falling for it. It's clear to me, a sufficiently competent technology enthusiast, block size increase is inferior in every possible way. And I'm not letting five-year-old intelligence control my money.

You are technical correct. The so-called "mining nodes" refers to the nodes that are run by miners and are connected to the mining hardware. The distinction has mainly been drawn by the hostile miners, namely Bitmain, in the battle of the activation of SegWit, which would unintentionally void their secret cheat, Covert AsicBoost, if activated. Other parties joined them because taking the power from the users is a way to centralize Bitcoin, which is the only way to destroy it.

I agree that a separate Lightning logo makes it look like an altcoin, or at least not related to Bitcoin.
A Bitcoin logo with, let's say, a small lightning on it may still look like an altcoin, because Bitcoin forks use Bitcoin logo.
I'm thinking a Bitcoin logo, a text (non-art) separator such as a colon or a double-colon, followed by a lightning art. This way it's (hopefully) clear that it's Bitcoin, and the same pattern can be used on other potential layer 2 and potential layer 3 solutions.

It might be that they don't care about right and wrong, which indicates that they are irresponsible.

This is not true unless/until coin-moving/signaling races occur. It's the genuine everyday non-bribing transactions that signal support, so no fee is paid specifically to bribe/incentivize miners. And my assumption is that such races won't happen.


Yes, they can. But there are other supporting miners. They will include the supporting transactions. As long as opposing hashrate is less than 50%, it should work. (Right?)
In addition, opposing miners moving their coins isn't completely risk-free. Supporting miners may orphan their blocks, and include the opposing miners' transactions to earn the transaction fees from them.
Hmm, in that case, the support rate should also be weighted by transaction fees.


I agree with you on the idea generally. Still like the explore the possibility since the assumption seems logic, although with the time passing by, miners may own more and more BTC if they try hard to hodl onto them, which may lead to long-term failure of EMASF. Data and mathematics is needed.

The reason to call them spam transactions is that they exist solely to make the block size a problem. They may look the same as real user transactions, but they are malicious. Spam is a proper word.
Increasing hard block size will not solve the spamming problem. It just costs more for spamming to be effective. It may seem that once the block size is big enough, the spammer won't be rich enough to spam anymore. But once the first hard increase is done, it creates a precedence. Bitcoin's haters, of which some are indefinitely resourceful, will join the spamming. They will be able to keep blocks full / fees high to push another increase, then another. In no time, few will be able to run nodes. That's when Bitcoin dies.
There *are* on-chain solutions being developed, e.g., Schnorr signature. Just like SegWit, they effectively increase block sizes by making transaction size small.

No, I didn't. The values of everyone's dollar goes down equally, with the banks getting a lot new money. The reason why the value of everyone's money goes down is because the new money joins the old money in purchasing available goods and so on, driving prices up. As a result, banks get richer, people get poorer.
I'm going to ask you one more time. How come the super rich become even richer with the stimulation that comes from inflation?
In fact, there wasn't any super rich people 50~100 years ago. It's the concentration of money, which is caused by inflation in the first place, that created the super rich.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) software is software that does not rely on centralized servers. P2P has the following main advantages:
- You doing have to trust anyone.
- It is extremely hard to shut down.
Such advantages are only possible if/when everyone runs their peer.
Bitcoin is a P2P currency. A full node is a peer. Running a node and using it to verify blocks is the only proper way of using it. Only by doing so can you ensure that you don't have to trust a third party. Running a node helps to prevent Bitcoin from being shut down.
There is another more sophisticated way to destroy Bitcoin. It's to hijack Bitcoin protocol by releasing modified malicious version of node software. By running your own node, you also help to stop such attacks.
Keep in mind Bitcoin has been, is and will be under attack by various people because it brings monetary sovereignty to people, which bankers hate; it makes money transferring easy and cheap, which payment and remittance companies hate; it is the king of cryptocurrencies, which altcoiners hate. They are very resourceful. One form of the attacks is by propagating that you don't need to run a node and lightweight wallets are good enough.
Run your own node to protect yourself, other users, and Bitcoin itself.

The brief history of rBTC
When there was only rBitcoin subreddit, some people, in the name of scaling, were promoting blocksize increase hardfork and bashing softfork solution SegWit in rBitcoin. These people mainly fell into two groups, one being shills of Bitmain, the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world, the other being altcoiners, mainly Ethereum stakeholders. The first group promoted blocksize increase hardfork to stop SegWit because SegWit unintendedly disabled Bitmain's cheat in mining (Covert AsicBoost), which made them the number one in the market. The second group wanted Ethereum to be the king of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin was in their way. There might be other Bitcoin haters, such as bankers and remittance companies, but their identities are hard to confirm. The second group and the rest promoted blocksize increase hardfork because 1) SegWit fixed some fundamental development-stalling bugs in Bitcoin, which might render their coins worthless; 2) hardforks were inherently risky and could be easily attacked; 3) hardfork block size increases could easily lead to centralization, which would destroy Bitcoin. They together disguised themselves as "Bitcoiners with different opinions".
For a period of time, these people spammed rBitcoin with lies and misinformation. The mods did their job and stopped them. When their operations got hard, Roger Ver, who was an early Bitcoin adopter (bitcoin dot com owner) but believed to had become a secret Ethereum stakeholder therefore a Bitcoin hater later, created rBTC sub in the name of free speech. They claimed rBitcoin was censored and theirs wasn't. The truth is, although they didn't delete the posts they didn't like, they used downvoting to hide them, and they imposed a 1 post per 10 minutes limitation to people they didn't like to stop them from freely express themselves. They claimed rBitcoin banned "Bitcoiners with different opinions" and they didn't, but they actually did it quite often. With these configurations, rBTC became the nest of them all.
Before Bcash fork, all rBTC sub did was pretending to talk about Bitcoin while spreading lies and misinformation, such that Bitcoin development is controlled by evil Blockstream, only Blockstream wanted SegWit, Blockstream was controlled by bankers, and things like that.
Then an epic battle in the community happened. Bitmain created Bcash, which was basically Bitcoin with SegWit removed. SegWit was activated. Bcash forked at the same time. Bitmain moved non-trivial proportion of their resources to Bcash. But the company saw Bcash as not Bitcoin. With SegWit activated and Bitmain moving on, altcoiners and other haters lost their directions for a while. They eventually came up with a new plan, which was to sell Bcash as Bitcoin (both figuratively and literally) and the idea that there could be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is mainly what they do besides spreading the old lies.
It's worth noting that there aren't many actual Bcash supporters in rBTC. They pretend to support it in order to undetermine Bitcoin.
Fun facts: Both Vitalik Buterin (founder and spearhead of Ethereum) and Jorge Stolfi (\u\jstolfi, a Bitcoin hater who publicly filed reports to authority claiming Bitcoin a scam) are popular in rBTC.
Bonus facts: Bitcoin(dot)com website, which is controlled by Roger Ver, sells Bcash as Bitcoin by making their wallet app create Bcash wallet by default and with no clear indication.  Twitter handle, which is believed to be controlled by Roger, bashes Bitcoin, pushes Bcash, and blocks people (so that its followers cannot see its lies getting refuted).
TLDR: rBTC was created by a Bitcoin hater (an altcoiner); was filled with Bitcoin cheaters (miner's shills) and Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on); is filled with Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on). rBTC is not a Bitcoin sub. It's an anti-Bitcoin sub.

@_date: 2017-04-15 22:54:21
Parent applications are irrelevant. The fact is that Jihan's using covert AsicBoost, which is not patented, have already caused serious centralization - serious enough to launch 51% attacks, which don't need 51% hashrate. If GMaxwell didn't find out, it will keep getting worse. Jihan may have already had more than 51% hashrate by taking advantage of other miners.
It's not innocent "more efficient chips" we are talking about, it's the cheating we are talking about.
In addition, patents, being closed, are incompatible with an open project/network like Bitcoin. It won't do any good. To be more precise, there won't be any benefits of them being patents rather than free-to-use technology.

Buying stocks and other investments don't guarantee anything. Everything gets more expensive over time by inflation. Just because your numbers are going up doesn't mean you are getting richer or not getting poorer. It's an illusion.
Thanks about it this way: remove the inflation from the equation and whether you get richer still depends on how your investments go.

Nonetheless, there is no evidence DK was not experienced in programming/C++. Having no evidence he could code isn't equivalent to having evidence he could not code. There are plenty of programmers who don't major in Computer Science and plenty of people who code as a hobby. As slim as it can be, the possibility that he was Satoshi is still there.

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin.
What was Bcash when it was created?
In a nutshell,
1. Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.
2. This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?
Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may including bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and  Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.
There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC and BcashSV. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.

making. 
I don't think your understanding is correct. The paragraph is to explain why PoW is used. You have to start from non-PoW solutions (the solutions before Bitcoin) to understand what this "decision making" means. It has nothing to do with the power. And it definitely has nothing to do with the decision making of software development/advancement.
In addition, Satoshi assumed that every node is also a miner. The decision making for block validity is meant for the nodes, not the miners.


I agree.


The fact that some miners are so into blocksize limit change is a result of misleading by altcoiners and possibly other Bitcoin haters. If they don't have the voting power, the problem doesn't even exist, because Roger/Jihan won't be spamming the network and the blocks are far from full.


I personally highly doubt the authenticity of the polls.
Even if it is genuine, it's a result of long time misleading from Bitcoin attackers. If the miners didn't have the voting power, it wouldn't have happened.

@_date: 2019-04-12 14:37:37
Both language barrier and limited knowledge hinder my understanding of your comment. After many times of reading, I think (hopefully) I get a general idea about what you are saying. Could you confirm whether my paraphrases below are correct?
(Beginning of paraphrasing)
BIP158 filters are good for local uses. If it is made to serve users on the network, it is apparently better than  BIP37 except the server DOS vulnerability. However, you don't think BIP158's improvement on privacy over BIP37 is as much as the public brief.
You understand why there is the concern by some people about giving miners more power, but you think the concern misses a bigger issue, which makes the concern invalid: BIP37 has connection/synchronization problems and BIP158 is not better. You believe the improved sync speed benefit will disappear after some months.
You don't think in reality BIP158 will last long therefore it doesn't concern you, except some nonsignificant disagreements with some statements of its benefits.
Before there is strong opposition, you think BIP158 will be merged into Core, but the reason of doing it is mainly an excuse of dropping support of BIP37. Some people will use BIP158 foolishly, but there is not much we can do about it.
(End of paraphrasing)
It seems that you did not address the concern that BIP158 will lead to reduced number of users running nodes. I assume you think it will not last that long to be a problem. Hypothetically speaking, if there is no doubt that it will survive, do you think having BIP158 filter not only default to off, but also require user authentication (users must know who they are connected to) will help alleviate its impact on node count (or at least lessen people's concern of it)?
Hypothetically speaking, if SPV weren't in Bitcoin white paper and there weren't any existing implementations or proposals, would you support it (or the idea of it) of any kind?
@_date: 2019-04-26 23:09:51
What's spend all funds?
@_date: 2017-04-10 01:57:05
I see your point.
When I first got into Bitcoin, I looked at in from critical point of view. My doubts we're gone one by one. At the last, only one remained: PoW can be attacked by big players. I considered that Bitcoin is design-level faulty because of it, despite that it should work until such attacks occur.
Then I realized that Bitcoin has opened the Pandora box. Even if Bitcoin itself fails because of the attacks on PoW, other cryptocurrencies will serve its purpose, which the attackers are not happy with. This will help to stop the attacks from happening. Then I read a comment of nullc, which says PoW doesn't exist in vacuum and the fact that PoW algorithm can be changed will help to stop the attacks.
So my perception about if PoW works is mixed.
By the way, thanks for your contributions to Bitcoin. You are a hero.

There are two types of people who have been pushing hard-forks, including a direct blocksize increase:
1. Bitcoin haters, mostly altcoiners but there maybe people of other reasons. Hard-forks are very risky by nature. A voluntary hard-fork that's unsuccessful will greatly damage Bitcoin.
2. Bitcoin miners. They are either fooled/used by Bitcoin haters to believe a direct blocksize increase or BU/EC is better than SegWit, or they have their agenda, because SegWit invalidates covert AsicBoost, which brings them massive profits.

Thanks for sharing your view.
As I said in another comment, Ledger didn't support SegWit2x to the same level as some other bad actors. I don't consider it bad or evil. But staying neutral was giving up principles. I always see Ledger as a competent businessman working in technology (by hiring competent technologists). But it's a businessman after all. Successful businessmen do not care much about principles. Only good businesses matter. As such, they probably thought (and think) it's not wrong to be neutral. And that's the problem.
To be clear, my stance isn't that I hate Ledger because they marginally supported SegWit2x. I don't like their stance, I know they would give up principles for business opportunities, but that's it. My main problem with Ledger is with their shills. I have no problem with benign shills - those who only praise their own products, barely criticize competitor's products, or only criticize competitor's products based on facts and don't count on it. I normally wouldn't even bother outing them. I've met shills of Ledger who are aggressive, trashing Trezor with non-facts, and apparently copying/pasting scripts without actually understanding them, just like the paid shills from rbtc, who are very annoying. I even suspected they were from the same shill company. It's a nasty practice. I can't stop it. But I can try and help Trezor with my word of mouth. Bitcoin needs companies with strong ethics. In addition to that, I genuinely think there is the risk that Ledger might give up their customers for profits, e.g., when the government pays big, hence cannot trust Ledger's products fully.

They are forks because they are incompatible with Bitcoin protocol (consensus rules) and their blocks are rejected by Bitcoin network. The absolute "length" (it's actually work) doesn't matter.


None of them is or may become. The narrative is made up to confuse users.


The consensus rule is the block size is no larger than some value. If the value is 2MB, blocks of 1MB- size satisfy the condition therefore will be accepted. There will not be a fork of 1MB chain.


The nodes decide.

The first two are arguably bribing. EMASF does not involve giving miners money. The transactions are normal genuine ones with the last digit of Satoshis set to specific values (in my quick example).
EMASF removes the veto power of miners in soft fork activation, if mining is decentralized enough and benign mining hash power is big enough.

It depends on how much money you are going to use the seed for.
If it's a small amount, Samourai wallet should do the job.
If it's a big amount,
If you can afford it, the best choice would be a hardware wallet. Trezor is recommended.
Otherwise, Electrum is very solid. It supports Linux, Windows and mobile. Linux is the most secure. Note that Electrum defaults to its own seed schema, which is incompatible with BIP39. Make sure you change it to BIP39 in the settings. For better security, you can use Electrum on an air-gapped PC - a "cold" wallet. It'd be nearly as secure as a hardware wallet. But it will not be as convenient to use. For better security, you can use multisig. It means you'll be managing more than one seeds and signing more than one times when spending. For even better security, you can use multisig cold wallets.
You can also consider Blockstream Green wallet. It is a "hot" wallet, but it uses multisig. Blockstream controls the second seed for you. Your coins are safe even if your seed is compromised. I'm not familiar with it, though. (Electrum supports the same feature, too, with a third-party service provider, which is not as famous as Blockstream.)

Roger could have signed from an address holding close amount of bitcoins as Loaded proposed, even if he didn't actually attempt to trade. He just claimed he would trade, misleading people to believe he had the coins.
The whole time it's just assumed that he still hold lots of bitcoins, though it's true at the beginning. But he has caused such a big stall of Bitcoin's advancement that he is obliged to prove himself now.
Think about this: why do people ask anyone who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto to prove himself by signing a message or moving coins?

Yes, you can build your own APK. Their github page has a tutorial.
With that being said, there are a few things:
1. The license of Mycelium client isn't strictly open source, although the source code is open and you can build your own binaries.
2. Mycelium server is closed source.
3. Mycelium follows the longest chain in the case of a fork.
The first one is trivial for personal users. The second one can be a serious issue, depending on how much you trust Mycelium devs. The third one may be a deal-breaker for some people (Core supporters).

Let's don't start this argument.


We all know why Bitcoin is created. Forgive me for not elaborating it.


Of course there is a difference.
Because when you argue that Bitcoin is a scam, you used gold as an example, saying that even gold investment is a scam.


Then why when I was saying Bitcoin is not a scam, you brought up COIN and said how scammy it is?


Try killing it.


I won't. Again, how did you draw a conclusion that bitcoin's expected profit is negative?


It is. Can't you read the graph by zooming out? Any amateur can see that.

There has been many "newbies" asking the same question in this sub and it mostly turned out that they were Bitcoin haters or miner's shills instead of innocent Bitcoin newbies. But before some substantial proofs that you are one of them, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.


Bcash ABC is created by a cheating miner who created the coin specifically because the route that Bitcoin took destroyed his cheating capability.
Bcash SV is created by a person who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto but failed to provide any evidence, and all proofs provided are proved to be forged.
In other words, both coins are created by liars.
In addition, neither coin has even remotely comparable number or quality of developers compared to Bitcoin.
You should take their words with a grain of salt.


Bitcoin developers don't decide on consensus rules changes, aka, protocol changes.


Its intent is to be a functioning a peer-to-peer digital currency. And it does that perfectly.


It's not in Bitcoin's design or implementation that it is or is not a store of value. It's not in Bitcoin's design or implementation that it has high or low fees. So Bitcoin does not care. Whatever it will become, it cannot derail from its original purpose - a P2P currency.


If gold has all the properties you want and can be had/used more cheaply, by all means go for gold, or any altcoins you see fit for that matter.
It's not in Bitcoin's design or implementation that it is or is not better than gold. So Bitcoin does not care.


The vision is to keep Bitcoin doing what it does, and carefully and gradually improve it.

Markets have decided. Some people don't want a hard block size increase *now*. So it can't go through since hard forks require consensus.

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin.
What was Bcash when it was created?
In a nutshell,
1. Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.
2. This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?
Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may including bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and  Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.
There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC and BcashSV. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.

That's amazing. How is that possible?
My only concern with a block size decrease is if the solution includes a way of increasing the block size back to 1MB base block size when needed. Because I'm worried Bitcoin haters will stop any hard fork to increase the block size when it's necessary in the future. In other words, I'm worried there will never be a hard fork (for protocol changes) that true Bitcoiners want in Bitcoin's history.

Is the following understanding of mine correctly?
The economic majority means the majority of entities that accept/buy/sell bitcoins. The UASF attempt is to make sure they, instead of regular node owners, run BIP148 activated clients. In that case, the coins mined on non-SegWit-signaling chain will be valueless because they can't be spent/exchanged. This serves as an incentive for miners to signal SegWit. Nodes of regular users, including Sybil-attacked ones, have no role in such a situation.

This is not true. Satoshi Nakamoto is likely a group. If that's the case, no individual alone can be Satoshi even if he can move those coins. The key of the genesis address (and the block) may be created by the group together, may be shared in the group after created by one of them (for bookkeeping for example), and may be given to another member for some reason (because quitting for example).
With that being said, I do think Scronty aligns with the inventor/creator of Bitcoin from every aspect. There are some errors and inconsistencies in his Bitcoin Origins story, which were pointed out by the community, but none bothers me because it's written years later without any written records to reference, as is said. I haven't finished reading the story, though. There is one (and one only) matter in all his statements that makes me suspect he's lying: he said (on another occasion than the video in the link) that he backdated the key that Craig used to prove himself being Satoshi *and he told Dave that it's how they could catch Craig cheating*. This is unlikely because Craig was Dave's friend while he was not. But I think he might have done it to troll and anger Craig.
There is one specific detail that makes me lean towards the idea that Scronty was the main creator (at least in writing the white paper and coding the software). At around 1:10:00 in the video, he mentioned a change of wording in the old (draft) white paper: from "broadcasted" to "broadcast". I checked both versions: [old]( vs [new]( He was not wrong. In addition, according to him, Craig didn't notice and has made a mistake by using the new (formal) version. I doubt many in the community noticed it. This is to say Scronty (or Dave) is likely the writer of the white paper. In addition to the white paper, there is a comment with the wording "broadcasted" in the source code in the early versions. The following code is from [Cryddit's pre-sourceforge files found on bitcointalk](
`// The basic transaction that is broadcasted on the network and contained in`
`// blocks.  A transaction can contain multiple inputs and outputs.`
`class CTransaction`
This is to say Scronty (or Dave) is likely the coder of the initial software.

I don't have a problem when you say lottery tickets are a scam.
If you say gold investment is a scam, I won't argue with you, too. But it's not because I agree with you. It's because you can't argue the same thing about bitcoin before you convince the authorities about gold investment being a scam. Gold, being a rare natural material, has been a solid even a haven investment option for thousands of years.
About good and bad stocks, there are good cryptocurrencies and bad ones. Investors need to do their research, as they do in stocks. Bitcoin apparently is a good one based on its history data. Instead of negative expected profit, bitcoin's price has been rising generally, despite all the attacks it has received and all the obstacles it has faced.

SegWit got activated because users forced miners to do it. The entire industry was completely powerless against users.














In this story,
- users == sheepdogs
- miners == sheep
- sheep returning to the pen == activation of SegWit
- sheep waking to the pen == normal way of activation of SegWit
- more grasses == 2x
- sheepdogs giving ultimatum == UASF
- sheep running to the pen == UASF's way of activation of SegWit 
- sheep jumping to the pen == miners' way of activation of SegWit (the first part of SegWit2x)
- packed grasses falling everywhere == miners failing at getting 2x via SegWit2x (the second part of SegWit2x)
- liars == those who claim SegWit was activated because of SegWit2x, not users/UASF
And you are one of the liars. The "entire industry" is so insignificant that it's not even in the picture.
Before NYA, SegWit had 33% miner support. UASF chain WOULD activate SegWit regardless of NYA or SegWit2x. It would ALWAYS have the potential to wipe out the original chain and become Bitcon. Bitcoin did not need NYA or SegWit2x AT ALL to have SegWit. And that's just the worst scenario that Bitcoin gets SegWit.
Every single industry entity that supported SegWit2x is a corrupt or bad actor.
Edit: bettered the analog.

What's different between Renaissance and the present is the technologies and subsequently the productivity, not whether you can get loans.
If I can take out $400,000 loan, so can other people. The numbers may be different, but will average out roughly on the same level. We will compete in the market, making the prices of houses somewhere around $400,000+X, where X is average savings of all people.
If the economy is not debt-based, no one can loan a big number of money. The prices of houses will be somewhere around X.
Between the two scenarios, everything is the same except that in the first scenario, you owe bankers $400,000, which is 30 years of slavery.
With BTC, we will be in the second scenario. There will be no repayments in 30 years. That's a lifetime of freedom. Sure it's good luck.

Hostile miners may behave in two ways: 1) mining empty blocks; 2) mining their self-transactions. There is nothing supporting miners can do about 1). For 2), since the purpose is to signal opposition, the transactions will have the flag set to signaling opposition. And they will keep doing it. It's easy for supporting miners can identify the hostile miners, and include those self-transactions in their blocks.
Of course, in this way, the signaling of opposition will count. ~~We can introduce miner supporting flag in the block, which can negate all different signals in transactions. So in supporting blocks, only supporting transactions will count; in opposing blocks, only opposing blocks will count.~~ (Deleted because it leads to new problems.)
By the way, I'm not fixed on having opposing signaling. Not sure if it makes sense.
Can anonymizing tumbler hide the flag in transactions? It actually doesn't matter because the signaling won't count if the flag is hidden. But I'd like to know why you bring it up.

Hard-forks in any cryptocurrency are very risky in general. Chain/coin splits can easily happen.
The reason why there are many voices for Bitcoin to hard-fork is that there are many Bitcoin haters, they want to destroy Bitcoin, and they know hard-forking is a good way. If a Bitcoin hard-fork happens, they will try their best to make sure things are as chaotic as possible. So hard-forks in Bitcoin are riskier than in other cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:11:58
It must be made clear that hired/workers are inherently not a part of community therefore they are not as important as any member in the community. A worker who don't behave can be removed from the community, if he is accepted by the hospitable community in the first place, without hesitation. It's not the same for a member of the community who don't behave. This is not to say that the member is safe from being removed. It's that the procedure and the tolerance are different.
To answer your question, if community members from different standpoints, think a miner isn't good, it's safe to say that the miner is not welcomed. If only one party says so, it's less convincing, but can be taken serious. This depends on the community. Whether the party is corrupted is less a problem because it's a part of the community. They may be punished by or removed from the community later on after the community find out that they are corrupted.
The point is that paid workers are outsiders. Outsiders are not as important as insiders. The problems with the outsiders are always more significant than the problems of the insiders in most cases.

Softforks are backwards compatible. Hardforks are not. Softforks are safe by default. Hardforks are chaotic by default. There are the differences.

No, I didn't. The values of everyone's dollar goes down equally, with the banks get a lot new money. The reason why the value of everyone's money goes down is because the new money joins the old money in purchasing available goods and so on, driving prices up. As a result, banks get richer, people get poorer.
I'm going to ask you one more time. How come the super rich become even richer with the stimulation that comes from inflation?

With or without some miners support, SegWit will be activated on UASF chain. SegWit had 33% miner support before the war. And UASF chain has the ability to wipe out the original chain whenever it has overall more work. That's why Bitcoin has SegWit today.
The whole point of UASF is that UASFers were done reasoning and wanted no compromise.

A blockchain is a chain of blocks in which every block has one (and one only) precedent block and one (and one only) descendent block, and every block is created with some kind of proof based on the precedent one, except the first one which has no precedent block and is created arbitrarily.

And user nodes can deny blocks made by miners if they are not considered proper.
It's miner nodes that get cut off from the network. The network is for users, not for miners. Miners are not even in the system. They are outsiders.
This is by design, and has been proved in real life. In UASF that activated SegWit, 85% of global hash rate together with many large corporates were defeated by a small amount of user nodes. What else do you have to say?

This is not correct. Spam transactions can use any fees. It depends on how much the spammer has to spend and there will be a race between him and the real users. They normally will end up with high fees.
There is a setting of lowest acceptable fee in Bitcoin Core . Transactions with lower fees will not be accepted into the mempool. Different miners may set them to different values. As a result, spam transactions don't even start with super cheap fees. The fees of spam transactions must be competitive compared to real user transactions.
In reality, spam transactions are not distinguishable from real user transactions.

Blocks have a field as miner's IP. When a block is generated and published on the network, other miners verify the sender's IP with the one in the block. An algorithm which gives penalty to miners who generate many blocks in recent time is used. For example, there is a wait time for any block to be confirmed. For a new miner, wait time is zero. For a miner that mines a lot in the past (say two hours), his wait time is for example 10 minutes. He's in a competition now. During this period of time, if another miner generates the same block, he enters competition, too. Whoever's wait time comes the first wins the competition. Different miners can mine different transactions therefore the contents of the blocks can be different. It's OK. An algorithm favoring new miners (in recent time) is used so that as long as most of the transactions are the same, or the numbers of transactions included are close enough, then the new miner wins.
I thought of using bitcoin addresses, but it's easy to work around.
Is IP address easy to fake and can quickly change?

Some people don't import. They just use the paper wallet, spend some btcs in it, and assume the rest are still in the same wallet.
"It's called wallet. Then unused money should stay there." That's what they think, which is intuitive.
Edit: Isn't it a common knowledge for all experienced paper wallet users?

I've heard that people lose btcs after spending some but not all the btcs in their paper wallets believing that the changes are back to their wallets.
@_date: 2016-09-20 10:16:52
Paper wallet is a completely different method of storing btcs. I'm sure there are other ways to store btcs. Every way has its features and goodness/badness. This is a specific way for Mycelium users to add an option for a more secure way for storing btcs.

The information being public makes the scenario you described possible, yes. He might have spent lots of time reading through the information in order to find small details like this and make himself extraordinarily informative about the creation of Bitcoin. He might expect people like me to dig it up and find the hidden "truth" that he casually discloses in an interview. Or I might be a part of the scam. I just don't think the probability is high. A scam is more efficient if it targets more people.
The claim of him being the master mind behind Bitcoin is not strong to begin with because there's no provable evidence. It's just that no one is remotely comparable to him as a candidate.

Are you saying that confirmations have nothing to do with the transactions in question?
Let's say there is a transaction waiting for confirmations. Does 0 confirmation mean that no block containing it has been found by anyone? Does 1 confirmation means the transaction has been included in a block that's found? Does 6 confirmations means 6 blocks have been found with the first one containing the transaction and the other 5, which come after the first one, having nothing to do with the transaction, except the general blockchain rule?

First of all, only the one "miner" who mines the block gets the reward (previously 25 btcs, now 12.5). This is true all the time. At the beginning (before any mining pool appeared), a miner is a miner - an individual. After mining pool appeared, a "miner" might be a pool with lots of mining hardware behind it. An individual miner no longer can mine any block after that. Nowadays the only way any individual can get btcs through mining process is to mine in a pool, where you do a small proportion of the work and get a small proportion of the reward whenever the pool mines a block. In short, the number 25 or 12.5 is irrelevant to you. Hope that makes it clear for you.

Forgot to answer the downside to raising block size. So here it goes.
The only way to destroy a peer-to-peer/decentralized system is to centralize it. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer system. A full node is a peer. An effective way to centralize Bitcoin is to make running full nodes unaffordable to most people so that only few can run them. Then they can be shut down easily.
To make running nodes unaffordable, simply make block size big.
Making block size big has many other issues related to centralization. The most serious one is it increases block propagation latency, which gives winning miner advantages, leading to mining centralization. It's another way of destroying Bitcoin.
In addition, using hard block size increase before all safer, more efficient, more future-proof solutions are explored (i.e., using hard block size increase now) is dangerous because it sets a preference. Bitcoin haters will keep block size full by spamming, pushing another hard block size increase, and another, and another... until most people cannot afford to run nodes. And that's the time when Bitcoin dies.

What you said is irrelevant to the fact that a bitcoin ETF is nothing but another insignificant option in the wild investment world. A bitcoin ETF does not specifically hurt naive investors, who can be hurt in any investment. (Actually, even seasoned investors can lose money in any investment.)
As a result, bitcoin "scammers" trying to scam naive investors by establishing an ETF isn't very convincing. They'd better off doing the Ponzi scheme directly.

When the majority miner propagates his secret higher work chain, does it wipe out all the latter blocks since the fork on every minority miner's hardware? If yes, the minority miners will be mining based on the new chain from the majority miner. How can they revert what's been wiped out? They don't even have the blocks to work on.
After writing the above texts, I think about the other question I just asked, then I have a sense that the work counted may include non-miners. And that work may be able to bring back the old chain. Waiting for confirmation.

We are talking about banks and governments. They have virtually unlimited resources (money). I understand there are dedicated mining hardware. They can buy them, lots of them. Electricity? Not a problem.
I'm talking about malicious cases, e.g., sabotage, or, war.
For example, Singapore starts to use blockchain for one of its national things, whatever it is. Then at some point Singapore offends China. Then China government buys ten times maybe even a hundred/thousand times more hardware, no matter what type it is, than Singapore owns. Then China starts 51% attack. What can Singapore do?
I understand that other ways, such as centralized servers, can be vulnerable, too. But 51% attack requires much less human intelligence and time, only money is needed, and money is not a problem. And the consequence of 51% attack is permanent - no backups can reverse it. Of course, a hard fork may help. But we've seen how messy it can be and yet it is not resolved (Ethereum).
Hold on. You said "temporary attack". Is 51% attack temporary? What's the attack that creates longer chain? That one is permanent, right?

In regarding to internet's development, my argument isn't that free contribution is all that matters. The importance of infrastructure doesn't invalidate the importance of free contribution.
In the history of computing, it has been proved many many times that software and content are the king. It's safe to say that the success of internet relies mainly on the software and content. Free contribution of software and content plays a critical role. Not to mention other big players, just imagine Apache, MySQL and PHP never existed.
To understand how much software matters, take a look at mobile network. The infrastructure costs tons of money, which may be comparable to internet. But because there is no software/developer support, it is merely a relay for cellphones to be connected to internet.
Bitcoin itself is a free contribution. We normally don't thank US government for the internet infrastructure it laid which helps the development and functioning of Bitcoin, because it is not (as) important.
Now that I understand that without miner rewards it is not Bitcoin, I'm still interested in knowing if a low-profile e g., a non-money-related, consensus network, would work with only free contributors.

The central point exists with or without auto-update. It's the Bitcoin repository.
I don't quite follow your statements about update pace. You brought it up and I was just explaining that is up to devs to control the pace.
Are you saying that you are not to worried about having a hard fork? The effort of auto-update is to make hard-fork easier.
With all being said, the NSA/mafia scenario does make auto-update a bad idea. Without auto-update, the damage can still be done, but in a much lower and easier to control manner. I'm convinced.

Thanks for the input. I agree with everything you said, especially the part that I may be misguided and having duplicated ideas, except that one cannot think someone else won't like something without even interacting with him. People have behavior patterns that you can learn and sometimes you can just tell. Admittedly I took someone's opinion without digging myself (I took the word that SegWit is kind of hacky). It's not that I don't want to learn everything related to Bitcoin. The learning curve is steep and there are a lot to learn. I'm trying. Just didn't get the time to read about something that I was told not to be the best.
On the other hand, did I offend you in some way? Are you a developer or even the creator of SegWit? If yes I feel very dumb for calling for you while saying bad thing about it, and I apologize for being prejudiced. But I'd like you to know that we are on the same boat, though you're in the captain's cab while I'm only a random supporter.

2. Import the old master seed. This will bring up the old account. Send all btcs in the whole account to the address written.
3. Import the new master seed.

Wallets are software/apps/websites for storing/spending bitcoins. Exchanges are services for buying/selling bitcoins. They are completely different concepts and serve different purposes.

Aren't most of us letting Bitcoin Core decide what we run right now? Do we have a choice other than choosing between Core, XT, Classic and Ultimate, which most people don't do/care anyway? Not to mention that lots of users don't even know what exactly they run. They just pick the mainstream.
Do you remember the recent news that the miners came to a decision in regarding to block-size dispute saying "you win, developers"? Do these powerful players who want to have a say in Bitcoin have a choice? If powerful players don't have a choice, do average users have one?
At least you get to select which team/project to trust. It's like you elect a president. The democracy allow you to make your choice, giving you some (illusion of) power/freedom, but not really any power that you can rely on. In Bitcoin's case, choosing a team/project is way more reliable.

Just to clarify, SegWit doesn't need consensus *to be activated*. It conforms to the original protocol therefore already has consensus *to exist*. It just needs some level of support to be activated.
Just to add,
1. When people talk about "big blocks", they refer to increasing block size limit with hard forks. Such changes do not conform to the original protocol therefore require consensus.
2. Hard forks are inherently risky, and can easily lead to chain split if not done cautiously and properly.
3. Besides the riskiness, "Big blocks" is inferior in every possible way compared to other ones that are being explored by the devs, which mostly if not all come with other merits than scaling.
4. There is another big issue with "big blocks". Once it's used by pressure from some Bitcoin users before better solutions are exhausted, it sets a precedence and it will be used over and over again until Bitcoin is centralized and destroyed.
5. SegWit *is* big blocks, just not the incompatible type that people usually refer to.

Are you talking about Bitcoin requires consensus, while automatic upgrades break consensus?

Are you saying that it's comparing hash as a number to a target number, not just by counting the leading zeros of the hash? That makes sense. What I've read is by counting the leading zeros. I think the article I've read is just simplifying the condition.
Just to make sure I understand it correctly, I'll use an example with small numbers (8 digits). From what I've read, which is wrong, an accepted hash must have say three leading zeros, so 00011111 and 00099999 both work. But the correct condition is that the hash as number must be smaller than current target number say 00034567. In this case, 00011111 will work but 00099999 won't. Let me know if my understanding is correct.

Don't you think that what happened to Ethereum is a disaster? How bad a hard fork can be is up to how many people choose to not update and why. You can't assume it'd be as simple as some people get forked off the network. I'd assume every hard fork tends to be a huge problem.
Back to the old topic. After a second thought, I'm back to where I was. I still think forced update is not only viable but also potentially necessary. (This time I'll emphasize "forced" rather than "automated".)
What convinced me was the NSA/mafia scenario. There are three issues.
First, there is a difference between should-be and can-be. We may never achieve a crimeless society. It doesn't mean we should not try.
Second, Bitcoin already uses forced update - the update of the blockchain. No one can prevent a forced update of the blockchain. The most work chain always wins. It's part of the consensus. It's part of the protocol.
Third, similarly to NSA/mafia scenario for forced client update, most work chain attack on the blockchain are possible for state-sponsored attackers, including NSA.
As a result, I'm unconvinced.
Now, besides forced client update can easily resolve hard-forking chaos, what makes it valid?
First, forced client update can be the devs' responsibility. To understand this, we need to revisit what exactly software development does. I don't want to quote any official definition, because Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are different. The purpose of software development, like any other job, is to "make it work". In Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies, which I like to call consensus-based software in this scenario, whether it works depends on consensus of embedded protocols in all clients. By embracing forced client update, it can be assured the whole network runs the same protocol, avoiding protocol inconsistency bug. (Yes, I'm calling it a "bug".) Since it's the devs who are responsible for the software development, it can be their responsibility to enforce the consistency of the protocol thus forced client update or some sort of consensused update, especially when there is no other/better way.
Second, forced client update can be the devs' right. The software is the brain child of the devs. Though users play an important role, it's ultimately up to the devs to define what rights the users can have. That's why we have end-user agreement or license, and it's around for decades. I personally expect an evolution of open-source license dedicated for consensus-based software.
Note that the arguments are not limited to Bitcoin. They may not even apply to Bitcoin, e.g., I assume the license of Bitcoin can't be changed now. They are general and more for newly created cryptocurrencies.

I laugh every time shills say we, the true Bitcoiners, don't get or understand something in Bitcoin. Core and their supporters have been criticized for ages, yet the criticizers cannot produce code without any major bugs in every single fork.


A non-mining node is a user node. It is a peer in a peer-to-peer network. Any user not using his own node is not using the coin in a peer-to-peer manner.


So you don't have one. You speculated it and talked like it's a fact.


What about good (valid) but 51%-attacked blocks?

@_date: 2018-03-28 01:00:10
Bcash (BCH) in a nutshell:
1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.
Bcash does not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It is an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:18:16
I don't remember the white paper describes that. Every user runs a node. That's what it says. In addition, have you ever used a peer-to-peer software?

The real question is: is it that they purposefully configured the miners that way in order to exploit their customers' electricity for a very limited period of time, or is it that they forgot to clear the settings / factory-resetting the miners after using them for months and before selling them as new?

How is difficulty adjusted? Is it by increasing and decreasing the number of leading zeros in the resulting hashes?
If yes, how can an average of 10 minutes mining time be guaranteed? I think the times required for different number of leading zeros are greatly different. Increasing or decreasing even one zero, the time difference will be big. How can it be tuned so that it's 10 minutes in average?

That's completely untrue.
When Bcash forked off from Bitcoin, it worked on a completely irrelevant blockchain. That blockchain has few users and the blocks were far from full. There was no "current" issue of full blocks in Bcash's blockchain.

When there was only rBitcoin subreddit, some people, in the name of scaling, were promoting blocksize increase hardfork and bashing softfork solution SegWit in rBitcoin. These people mainly fell into two groups, one being shills of Bitmain, the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world, the other being altcoiners, mainly Ethereum stakeholders. The first group promoted blocksize increase hardfork to stop SegWit because it unintendedly disabled Bitmain's cheat (Covert AsicBoost), which made them what they were. The second group wanted to be king of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin was in their way. There might be other Bitcoin haters, but their identities are hard to confirm. The second group and the rest promoted blocksize increase hardfork because hardforks were inherently risky and could be easily attacked, and SegWit fixed some development-stalling bugs. All these people disguised themselves as "Bitcoiners with different opinions".
For a period of time, these people spammed rBitcoin. They did it with lies and misinformations. The mods did their job and stopped them. When their operations were hard to carry out, Roger Ver, who was an early Bitcoin adopter (bitcoin dot com owner) but thought to become a secret Ethereum stakeholder and Bitcoin hater later, created rBTC sub in the name of free speech. They claimed rBitcoin was censored but theirs wasn't. However, although they didn't delete the posts they didn't like, they used downvoting to hide them. They claimed rBitcoin banned Bitcoiners with different opinions and they didn't, but they actually did. With these configurations, rBTC became the nest of them all.
Before Bcash fork, rBTC sub pretended to talk about Bitcoin. But what they did most was misleading newcomers.
Then an epic battle in the community happened. SegWit was activated. Bcash forked at the same time. Bitmain moved lots of their resources to Bcash. But the company saw Bcash as not Bitcoin. With SegWit activated and Bitmain moving on, altcoiners and other haters lost their focus for a while. They eventually came up with a new plan, which was to spread the misinformation that Bcash was Bitcoin and there could be many Bitcoin. This is mainly what they do now. They still spread the old lies and misinformations, e.g., Bitcoin development is controlled by evil Blockstream.
TLDR: rBTC was created by a Bitcoin hater; was filled with miner's shills, altcoiners and other Bitcoin haters; is filled with altcoiners and other Bitcoin haters.

In your scenario, my question would be, given that paper money is easier to carry but more susceptible to burning compared to coins, do current people prefer paper $100 bills, or $100 coins?
Or, given that $100 bill in one is easier to carry and manage, but harder to use in cases of spending small amounts, do current people prefer $100 bill in one, or multiple small amount bills that add up to $100?
Edit: your scenario isn't right for my questions. There are down-side of larger blocks. And that's one of the questions I'm asking.
@_date: 2016-09-17 11:02:08
(Bigger blocks) But bigger blocks generate more revenue. Are you saying that miners prefers to mine few transactions? Is that happening right now? I'm confused.
(Miner reward) I'm asking if mining for free would work, just like internet evolved and developed by benefiting a lot from free contribution. Would Bitcoin survive in a completely different shape, with no commercial mining but much more personal mining that is not energy hungry?

Your intention is not clear. Do you want to store the value or to use it?
Anyway, before putting any money, you have a loooooot to learn in regarding to the security. The protocol itself is extremely secure. But there are many pitfalls in the real life use at current stage. There is no one page to master it all. You have to keep reading.

You own transaction generator is still software wallet. But since you develop it yourself (good on you, by the way), there is no phishing risk for sure, but it also means it's less safe (more prone to bugs because code reviews are necessary for code quality).
Anyway, besides that you are a user, you are a developer. You can't give advices to users from your developer's aspect. What you day doesn't apply to them. As a result, it is not true for general users.
I don't trust Ledger, either, because of the same reason you mentioned - they are not full open source.
Address reuse is not a feature. Sweeping doesn't make the issues go away. The main issue is that it jeopardizes the privacy of both yourself and everyone your transactions involve. I can't recall at the moment, but there may be other issues.

It's well accepted that security/cryptographic products are better open than closed. An algorithm that is studied by all experts in the field all over the world provides better security and the peace of mind.

I don't think it'd be feasible to do it every block. Only occasionally, such as once per 1024 blocks. As a result, I think it'd be more an alternative solution to the checkpoint system. Of course, these is no hard supporting evidence or science.

@_date: 2019-01-14 04:21:04
After reading all comments, my (non-expert) thoughts are:
The biggest difficulty is that it needs a hard fork, which requires consensus.
The biggest problem is the the number of the votes included in the block. The weight must be consistently significant. My gut feeling is that the number can't be a fixed number. It needs to be a formula. But it will be hard to find the formula that can handle all situations.
The second biggest problem is the size of the signatures of the votes, when the number of votes is big.
One way to handle both problems is that only occasionally (but regularly) will there be a block mined with votes. Blocks of this type can contain as many votes as possible (and as few transactions as possible). This way, it's basically a replacement of the current checkpoint approach, which is disliked by many, including Core developers.
I don't see collusion being a problem, assuming most coins are currently not held by Bitcoin haters. I don't see it making Bitcoin not trustless. The key security issue can be handled with proxy keys. But, again, I'm no expert.

It may be compatible or incompatible with some or all aspects of those. It just doesn't care, either way. It will fulfill its purpose, which is described in your first paragraph.

That seems to be my misunderstanding in this case and it's why I'm confused. I now recall that I've read that it's not the longest chain that's accepted.
However, I still don't understand how the amount of work is calculated. I thought the only work counted is the work that miners perform to find the blocks. Was I wrong?

In addition to that block size increase causes degradation of decentralization,
1. It's an inferior scaling solution. It provides linear increase only.
2. It requires a hard fork. A hard fork requires overwhelming consensus. Otherwise, the chain will split. In the case of block size increase, many people are knowledgeable enough to be against it. There is absolutely no consensus. (With that being said, it's a mostly agreed that eventually block size increases will be inevitable, but that should be done after all non-disruptive optimizations are done. In other words, unlike you might have heard, no one who is currently against block size increases is actually against block size increases.)
3. The reason why block size increases were pushed is to stop SegWit from being activated because it unintentionally disabled a cheat in Bitmain's miners, namely Covert AsicBoost.

You logic is wrong in your first metaphor: board-size = block-size. To be fair, I'm not against (or pro) the metaphor itself. It's what's behind it that's wrong.
You are talking about all the games after the rule (board size) is changed, and you are ignoring all the games currently being played. And in Bitcoin's case (as well as all cryptocurrencies' case), it's what's currently happening that's in the core of the problem.
In chess' case, it's up to the current players to use the new rule. They will either use the old rule or the new rule. The players don't get duplicated and the games don't get duplicated. In cryptocurrencies' cases, both the players and the games get duplicated. And that's the problem. Every hard fork creates a new game, or a parallel universe if you use physics term, and a lot of the players will be busy visiting every universe to get the most out of it. It's a great way to ruin any cryptocurrency.
Hard forks for any reason should be avoided if all possible. If it has to happen, it must be planned, communicated and carried out extremely carefully. I assume it's not completely avoidable. So the goal is to reduce the overall times of hard forks in Bitcoin's history by including as many changes requiring hard forking as possible in every hard fork. Delaying hard forks as much as possible will also help because it will enable more changes requiring hard forking to be discovered.
@_date: 2016-09-02 13:00:21

If it's true, yes it's a disaster.
But I think the idea isn't letting voting take over. Voting only takes effect when two forks have comparable accumulated work. It isn't meant to remove miners' power. The attacker must gain sufficient hash rate to perform an attack, which is no different from the current scenario. Admittedly, finding a working fair formula to weight voting may be hard. Correct me if I'm wrong.

By the way, about SegWit, it is a soft-fork; it doesn't require consensus; it has all the support it needs; it is Bitcoin; you don't have to use it; you opposition doesn't matter.


It's not critical. The problems caused by fixing the code outweighs the benefits it. It can and will be fixed if a good opportunity occurs.

SegWit is a boring technical details that you and me and most Bitcoin users are not supposed to know about. It's really nothing of your concern unless you are looking to learn Bitcoin programming.
The reasons why you have heard about it are 1) SegWit stands in the way of some greedy cheater in Bitcoin (Jihan/Bitmain); 2) Bitcoin and its developers stand in the way of some haters (led by Roger Ver). They collude to use SegWit as an excuse to attack Bitcoin developers, aka, the Core devs.
Here are some of the things you need to know about Bcash, a hard-fork from Bitcoin that removed SegWit and is sold by Roger and Co. as Bitcoin:
1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the starting of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.
Bcash does not resolve any problem in Bitcoin. Every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.

With the possibility of longer chain attack, even though it's unlikely, it cannot be certain that what's on blockchain is the true history. How can any application of smart contract be possible if it cannot be certain? It's legal we are talking about here.
I understand that what's on the blockchain is certainly true (true means it happened). But things that happened may be removed from blockchain by the longer chain attack. As a result, the chain may be lying or missing information, even though every block/transaction is true.

As far as I know, creating additional HD account in Mycelium doesn't require/generate new seed. I think how is works is that besides addresses, the accounts are deterministic, too. The only seed needing backup is the master seed, which is already done. I don't see how to create HD account with a seed. And needing to remember or back up a new seed is what this method tries to avoid. It doesn't involve any more memorizing work that's intensive. It's like regular hiding. With regular hiding, you only memorize where you hide it, which is a minimal effort.

I'm hoping that workload intensity algorithm based on block fullness can be designed in a way that it can't be cheated.
Just some ideas for your examples.
1) Block fullness can be checked with a combination of both size (as in bytes) and transaction numbers. A full size block with too few transactions are deemed not full (in some way).
2) Transactions are weighted with miner fees when calculating block fullness rate (or workload intensity rate, whatever you call it). Filling blocks withb transactions with low/zero fees won't help.
Yes, I think miner fee weighted block fullness rate (or workload intensity rate) would be something I'll look into more if the basic idea is promising.
"Bitcoin Days Destroyed" is something completely new to me. Will have to spend some time to read.
Edit: I realized miners can cheat by creating transactions from and to themselves with high miner fee. Something for me to think about. Might be a deadend.

Thanks for the detailed explanation and the video. I'm convinced.
The video is great. It is enlightening not only in the part that's related to this topic directly. I allocated some dedicated time for it since I believed I wouldn't be able to understand it if I didn't. It turned out I was right. There are still parts that I failed to understand. Will definitely review it when I get some more time.
What do you think about Bitcoin tools that are created with Python, such as Electrum? Do they suffer from the similar issues since Python is an interpreted language and is not typed safe, too?
Can you think of any advantages and disadvantages that commercially maintained cryptography libraries, such as the ones in Mono and .Net Core, have over community-maintained ones? I'm aware of OpenSSL's Heartbleed vulnerability.
I'm aware of "never write your own cryptography" principle. My only concern/paranoid is if NSA is able to know the vulnerabilities in the standards that they approve while other cryptographers cannot find out easily. Do you think it's possible? If you are to choose algorithms used in Bitcoin, will you have preferences between NSA-approved ones and academically recommended ones?

What do you mean?
Multi-sig is similar to you using multiple wallets. But instead of each wallet accesses some of your coins, all wallets must be used together to access any of your coins.
The process of spending coins requires signing. Regular coins have the spending condition that the (one) corresponding key to the coins must be signing the spending. Multi-sig coins have the spending condition that all required keys must be signing the spending. It's called co-signing.
You can have full control with multi-sig. No third party needs to be involved.
Some businesses provide custodial multi-sig. IIRC Electrum has such a mode that some company helps to hold one of your master keys to your coins and co-sign your spending. But it's totally up to you if you want to use them.

True, but that's just for now. The technology will become easier and easier to use. When people learn what banks have done to them and that banks of Bitcoin can do the same (fractional reserve system), they will want to store bitcoins themselves.

Doesn't mean they are correct.


That's not true. Few theories outside Bitcoin are agreed to by the most competent cryptocurrency developers - Bitcoin Core devs.


This demonstrates how not knowledgeable you are. IP addresses are extremely easy to change. Moreover, if everyone has a fixed unchangeable IP address, there is no need for proof-of-work therefore there is no need for Bitcoin.


SegWit doesn't exclude Covert AsicBoost.

I don't know the history, but I think Andreas was the one who created the concept.
The concept is actually more profound than its face value. It's not just about the security of the coins or even your full control of them. It is about no one else will be able to use them in any shady way, e g., fractional reserve. More and more banks start to provide Bitcoin wallets, where users don't own the keys. If people let them, they will some time in the future use fractional reserve to inflate Bitcoin. Don't fall for it. Bitcoin provides all the merits of banks without their drawbacks. Just be your own bank.

The backbone of Bitcoin is blockchain, which is a database publicly available to everyone containing every single one of transactions in history. So transaction-wise, Bitcoin has no privacy at all.
Bitcoin is pseudonymous because there is no registration process therefore it's hard to link addresses to real life identity. That's the basic privacy Bitcoin provides. (Note that since transactions are all visible, the privacy may be jeopardized in some cases, especially when you reuse addresses.)
In addition to that, as other Redditors pointed out, you can use mixing services,  exchanges or any services that you can transfer your btcs in and out of a pool to add more privacy.

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin. In a nutshell,
1. Bcash is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?

I've come up a new idea. It's very similar to my original one, while it should be able to remove the issues of block propagation and orphan blocks. Inflation rate remains intact. What's better is that the old idea is not indefinitely scalable, this one is.
Everything stays the same, except what's dynamically adjusted is the block size, instead of difficulty / mining time.
When workload level is 1 and the condition of too much work is met (many consecutive full blocks), we add 1MB to the upper limit of the block size and the level becomes 2. If it's 2 and the condition of too much work is met, we add another 1MB and increase the level by 1. And so on.
On the other hand, if workload is at let's say level 3, which should allow 3MB block size, and there are many consecutive blocks with less than 2MB size, we reduce the block size to 2MB and decrease the level to 2.
In short:
1) current_block_size = current_workload_level * base_block_size
2) current_workload_level is adjusted based on the fullness of the last N blocks on the chain (so we have consensus)
I can't think of any issue except that it requires a hard fork. Please let me know if this will potentially work and it there are (potential) pitfalls.

Day-trading is the way whales eat up small fish. This is true in every market.
Whales 1) have the resources to manipulate the market, 2) have the connections thus more/truer/fuller information/knowledge of what's going on in the market, 3) can hire more competent people to analyze the market.
There are fish in between, but the game is basically whales eat big and small fish, big fish eat small fish.
Many small fish can profit occasionally, and all fish can profit sometimes, e.g., in a bull market, in which case holding will have the same effect, but eventually, for many big and most small fish, all profits will be gone accompanying by losses.

On-chain transactions well never be zero. LN is not meant for high value transactions because they are not final. Only intermediate status are kept, off chain. If the status is lost for some reason, significant losses are possible. For the same reason, people will settle LN transactions on chain once in a while.

Those are not "summary" of issues of hardware wallets and software wallets. There have been many more issues and more issues will occur, and that's NOT a problem because they keep getting fixed. Security is not a state. It is work in progress.
Paper wallet, on the other hand, has permanent issues, such as address reuse. There is no fix, ever.
The bottom line is: paper wallet has caused many people to lose money, while no money has been lost due to security vulnerabilities of reputable hardware and software wallets, as far as I know. (Phishing does not count, and phishing of hardware and software wallets can cause paper wallet to lose coins, too, because paper wallet can't be spent without a hardware or software wallet.) And that's a fact.
Quoting issues of hardware and software wallets in order to justify paper wallet is idiotic, because how are you going to spend your paper wallet? As is said above, paper wallet can't be spent without a hardware or software wallet.
Lastly, if you intend to convince people, at least try to write your comment properly. Use punctuations. Use paragraphs. Organize the content in proper orders. It's less convincing if your writing is messy. It's a waste of other people's time if they have to guess what you are trying to say.

Here is my understanding:
- All of the transaction data is hashed to create transaction ID.
- SegWit is part of the transaction, i.e., it's not a new transaction.
- SegWit is part of the output of transaction.
If my understanding is correct, how can the data in SegWit not be included in the hashing process to create the transaction ID? And the more importantly, how can old nodes consider it valid given that it doesn't follow the old rule?

No. Nothing available is/was better than SegWit.
In addition, we all know why other solutions are proposed: it's to preserve the cheating advantage that Jihan/Bitmain has, which has brought Bitcoin to the brink of failure. I'd say SegWit has a huge bonus for this sake.
The opponents if Core/SegWit have argued so many years, appearing that they are competent enough to do so. The fact is, they can't even produce simple code that works without major issues. Every contentious forks failed to some severe extent.
Unless you can demonstrate your competence, you don't have a say in how a bug should be fixed. You don't go into a cockpit to teach how the pilot should fly a plane. This applies to me, too. I don't argue because I'm competent enough. I argue because I know I'm more competent than most of the opponents of Core/SegWit.


This is a complete nonsense. You keep demonstrating your incompetence in Bitcoin technology. Hard-forks loosen the rules causing inevitable and unresolvable chain splits. Soft-forks tighten the rules and won't cause chain splits if sufficient hashrate supports it.

It is what the enemies of Bitcoin want you to believe. Bitcoin is decentralized (peer-to-peer), making it extremely hard to kill. The only way to kill it is to centralize it. They spread the misinformation in order to make people believe only miner nodes matter. Then they can shut down or change Bitcoin easily.
User nodes are rule enforcers. As long as you run a node, no one can break the rules you agree to. As long as enough people run nodes, no one can really shut down Bitcoin.

It was. It is not. There is no known security exploit at the moment.


Security protocols like standards of encryption and hashing are done in the same manner. Weaknesses are found and patched. The refined versions may be agreed to be secure.


No, hidden parts are obscurity. It is not security.




There is no politics. It is very simple that SegWit2x is not Bitcoin. Ledger people are competent enough to know it clearly. As I said, when there is a hidden part in the product and the maker of the product is willing/likely to trade principles for money, you can only imagine what would be in the product.

Trezor's company and the boss, Slush, firmly supported UASF and rejected SegWit2x. On the other hand, [Ledger called Bitcoin chain "Bitcoin-1x" and SegWit2x chain "Bitcoin-2x".] ( It's not as bad as calling SegWit2x an "upgrade", but they still had no legit reason to give SegWit2x credits. (In case you are not familiar with SegWit2x, it's an attack on Bitcoin. It's started by some power-grabbing miners, and supported by some corrupt parties, such as Coinbase, a bankster's company. Check the support of SegWit and SegWit2x [here] (
Slush's pool mined Bitcoin rather than Bcash, which was more profitable, during Bcash pump-n-dumps. Many pools switched to mining Bcash, causing issues in Bitcoin network.

Are your saying the legacy multisig is not P2SH-P2PKH?
I've got some relevant questions.
1. If I use both the P2PKH address and the (legacy) P2SH multisig created from the same private key, is it address reuse? I guess it is not address reuse per se (it's private key reuse). But my question is more about if it comes with the same security and privacy risks.
2. Does P2SH-P2WSH multisig have the space-saving benefit over legacy P2SH multisig like regular SegWit addresses? What are the benefits?
Edit: What are the BIP numbers for multisig with native P2WSH and P2WSH wrapped in P2SH?
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:28:14
Fixes for severe bugs and security issues should be achievable.
In other cases, if it can't be achievable, the hard-fork should not happen while keeping the name of Bitcoin, but it can happen with a different name. In other words, it should become a different coin. Again, this is my personal opinion. In reality, I probably won't argue if there is overwhelming support because of the existence of Bitcoin haters - there is no way you can tell if the opposition is authentic.
Edit: I'm talking about improvements. Rollbacks must have 100% support.

There isn't.
AntBleed is an issue in Bitmain's miners only and has been patched. The first patch was made by Core devs. Then Bitmain provided their patch, too.
AsicBoost, on the other hand, is an issue in Bitcoin. But it isn't a vulnerability except that it causes mining centralization, which is already there.
Covert AsicBoost makes mining 20 times more profitable. But it only increases the speed by 20%, which isn't much when one tries to attack the network, especially because the current Bitcoin hashrate is enormous. In other words, it is significant when it comes to the commercial interest, but insignificant when it comes to attaching the network.
Note that AsicBoost is patented. Anyone wanting to use it has to pay a hefty patent licensing fee first. And Bitcoin can always change the mining algorithm when it's under attack, bricking millions to billions of dollars of investment in hours.
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:32:30
Good point. A few things I think can be added to your calculations: 1) Miners earn not only block rewards, but also transaction fees. The fees tend to get higher when rewards get lower. There has been a block in which the overall fee is higher than the reward. 2) Some big miners, especially early ones, should have sufficient cash flow to keep their businesses running without selling (all) their newly mined coins. This reduces the selling pressure.
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:45:42
Bitmain is a known cheater (Convert AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed).
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:07:32
1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the starting of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.
Bcash does not resolve any problem in Bitcoin. Every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.

Why can't old miners/nodes create the scriptSig and transfer the btcs into their addresses? After all, in the rules they know it's legit to do so and others would approve.
I understand that new nodes won't approve. But adoption/activation of SegWit in the network takes time. There will be times that non-SegWit nodes are predominant.

Thanks for the detailed explanation. It appears that most of my understandings are correct.
Just to confirm: Does your term "higher/highest work chain" mean "longer/longest chain"?
I don't understand the last part. How can waiting for confirmations help when there is a majority miner with more than 51% hash power secretly building his own longer chain? You said it yourself that a secret may be built for a long time without being noticed. The secret longer chain can replace the public chain, right? If yes, does the number of confirmations matter?
Just to reiterate my original question: Is 51% attack temporary? Can it be reverted?

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin. In a nutshell,
1. Bcash is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.
Bcash does not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It is an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.

My question is not about the bigger scalability problem. It's about if larger blocks are favored or disliked by miners due to the aforementioned reasons.
@_date: 2016-09-16 14:36:55
I've been thinking about the same idea. Here is my proposal:
Difficulty is adjusted according the combination effect of both overall hash rate and current workload. That effect can be determined with the blockchain, which is agreed by all nodes. If there are many consecutive full blocks, it means there are more transactions than current block size can handle. In this case, we halve the difficulty, resulting halving of mining time, which doubles the transaction handling speed.
The workload level starts from 1, which means difficulty / mining time is solely determined by overall hash rate. It goes up to 2 when many consecutive full blocks are on the chain. When it's 2, difficult / mining time is halved compared to when it's 1. When it's 2 and there are many consecutive full blocks, it goes up to 3, making difficulty / mining time 1/3 of original values. And so on.
As an example of how workload level is adjusted downwards: If workload level is at 2 and there are many consecutive non-full blocks, it will go down to 1.
Reward will be adjusted based on difficulty, so that overall reward per minute stays the same.

I am interested in finding out how many BTC are in SegWit addresses myself and my theory is by calculating the difference of BTC in P2SH addresses between before SegWit is activated and now.

I am.
Remote exploits are the only thing matters. Getting the physical access to the device in order to crack it is on a completely different level. It's a crime that's much harder than hacking to commit, and much easier to counter and get caught.
In security, the first thing to identify is the threat model because there is no absolute security. Getting the device stolen is not a threat model for most people. Being hacked remotely is for everyone.
In addition, a common threat model is "what if the manufacturer is vile", which Ledger falls while Trezor doesn't.


No, you didn't. No one lost funds. No one's Trezor is hacked. Literally.


You can do whatever you want, but you are ignorant in security.


If something is theoretically broken, it is practically broken. I don't need to show you anything other than theories.
The Secure Element can easily enable hacking (remotely and within proximity, which I can think of; there are far more possibilities than I can think of) without anyone knowing. The 8-character addresses can enable stealing remotely via malware and xpub, which is often not kept secret. The recent MITM address replacement can be done remotely with malware. All are real and practical. And there has been no practical exploits in Trezor.
Ledger can not compete with Trezor in security. It is wrong to even say "Ledger is less secure then Trezor". The right way to say it is: Trezor is secure. Ledger is not.

I assume you are talking about if the Trezor devices are actually made by the open source designs because, as a matter of fact, all designs are open source.
In that case, I'm not informed if someone has done a thorough audit, but as far as I know, the hardware components are all open source, the source code is open source, and the binaries can be verified with the source code. I don't think hiding a backdoor in feasible in this case.
In addition, the damage will be deadly if caught cheating. Only people like Jihan have the audacity to do things like that, and we know Trezor people are the opposite.

Mempool isn't a universal thing. Every node (thus every miner) has its own mempool. Every miner choose the transactions he sees fit. As a result, different miners work on different blocks. One of them will be mined before others. Then it will get propagated. When another miner receives it, he will abandon the block he has been working on, and work on a new block based on the newly received one.
There is no cooperation. Miners compete. Some/most work is wasted (in the sense that there is no reward).
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:15:00
It doesn't take a lot of intelligence to understand any increase (not just 2x) of blocksize is potentially harmful. The more importantly, 2x will create a precedence of such a practice, which we certainly don't want.
It's clear that 2x is an attack. Why would one want a blocksize increase right after a blocksize increase is introduced (and not used!)? There are tons of evidence that is an attack.

With that being said, B2X doesn't have 95% hashrate. The party fell apart when Jihan created BCH while showing his inconfidence in B2X in the process.

I thought salability problem is not the same as larger blocks because larger blocks have their own problem, and that's why people come up ideas such as SegWit and LN to get around with the problem, without touching the block-size dilemma.
As I said, my question is not about scalability. It's solely about what miners prefer at current stage based on the characteristics of larger blocks.
Think about my question this way: There is no scalability at the moment. People are all happy with the current network. Now I ask: due to the characteristics of larger block, do miners prefer to include as many transactions as possible in their blocks (resulting in full blocks), or do they prefer to include as few transactions as possible in their blocks (resulting in every block containing one transaction)?
In other words, my question is about larger blocks, not about larger block-size.
Of course, it won't hurt to know the answer to my question when block-size is say 2MB or 8MB, if that makes any difference.

In addition to blocksize increases being a temporary solution, which other comments have addressed, a blocksize increase is a hard-fork. Any hard-fork requires every user to agree and update its node to work. Any hard-fork without consensus is an altcoin. Big blockers push such a change in spite that some people don't agree.
The number of people who are against a hard-fork doesn't really matter, but, as a matter of fact, most reasonably competent users are against a blocksize increase (at this stage). Whether the reason of the disagreement is legit doesn't really matter, either, but, as a matter of fact, it is legit.

Freedom of choices cannot override agreements. If you have agreed on something and change your mind later, you are free to follow your new decision as long as the agreement is not invalidated.
When you run a coin, you agree on the rules and that the rules are under the name of the coin. If you later want to change the rule, you can as long as it's under a new coin name, or, you get everyone's agreement on changing the rule.

1. LN is not Bitcoin per se. It's based on the technology that Bitcoin provides. There is no release of "Bitcoin" when it comes to the "releases" of LN.
2. LN is a protocol. It's worked on by multiple teams. There is no release of LN as one piece of software.
3. Individual implementations are released, and on testnet only. The developers didn't not release them to the mainnet. The users bring them to the mainnet. They are responsible for their own actions. If funds are lost, it's not the fault of LN developers, and it has nothing remotely related to Bitcoin developers. And most importantly, there will be no bailout in Bitcoin. There is not even a centralized body who can perform the bailout even if some people wanted to.


1. ETH is valueless solely because it is a centralized coin in a decentralized territory.

5. You have the audacity to bring up the leader of ETH after all his bailouts (attempts). For his own financial interests! Code is law my ass.
6. ETC is the real/original Ethereum. Code is law.

1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the starting of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.
Bcash does not resolve any problem in Bitcoin. Every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.

With 10% hashrate it will take about 100 minutes to produce a block. Yes, the miner can replace the old blocks of he is patient. But what's the point if no people is using it?
You are talking about a scenario that won't happen. If there are users, there will be other miners building on the latest block. In that case the attacker needs 51% hashrate to undo blocks.

Competition with earlier versions is a good point. Thanks for pointing it out. However, it's still arguable that forced upgrades are viable maybe even necessary in a project that's not only a work-in-progress but also an innovation-in-progress that is destined to be changed dramatically from time to time.
Neither hard-forking nor auto-upgrading is incompatible with slow updating. The whole process can still be done carefully. It's just that since devs have the full control, they should be wise about when to use the power.

One thing with paper wallets that is counter-intuitive is that if you spend some but not all the bitcoins, you may expect that the unspent bitcoins remain in the same paper wallet. But they don't.

But you (Ledger) did call Bitcoin "Bitcoin-1x" and SegWit2x "Bitcoin-2x".
As I said, it's not as bad as actively supporting SegWit2x like calling it an upgrade, but it is still unacceptable.
I was puzzled by your (Ledger's) announcement especially because the stand was vague. But I think I've figured it out. It is because you were not bribed. You believed that a neutral, or in other words, principle-less, stand would provide more business opportunities than picking a side. You didn't want to lose the potential business opportunities that might come from SegWit2x proponents, who were all extremely rich. Anyway, money / business opportunities were of higher priority than principles in Ledger's eyes. I believe it is also why Ledger is more commercially successful than Trezor, by the way.
Edit 1 &amp; 2: To be fair, ~~I don't think Ledger is corrupt or hostile~~ I think Ledger is unlikely corrupt or hostile (I won't take the risk, though) - not at the moment. The company may just be run by regular businessmen, who always put business first. Nonetheless, you are more compromisable than Trezor. Trezor can't be compromised by money.

August 1st: Bitcoin Cash: an altcoin; a hard-fork from Bitcoin.
October 25th: Bitcoin Gold: a random altcoin; a hard-fork from Bitcoin.
Mid-November: (the hard-fork part of) SegWit2x: an altcoin; a hard-fork from Bitcoin.
SegWit2x coin, also known as B2X or S2X, is most comparable to Bitcoin Cash, also known as BCH or BCC.
Comparisons between BCH and B2X:
Initiators and supporters:
BCH: initiated by Bitmain alone; seriously supported only by ViaBTC, which is clearly controlled by Bitmain; lately supported by bitcoin.com.
B2X: signed by 30-ish companies and miners; some have withdrawn.
(Neither has support from users/nodes.)
BCH: clearly declared as not being Bitcoin; bitcoin.com started to call it Bitcoin.
B2X: claiming it's Bitcoin; calling it an upgrade of Bitcoin; nodes pretend to be Core compatible.
Replay protection:
BCH: provides strong two-way replay protection
B2X: intentionally doesn't provide replay protection
BCH: no one considers BCH as a major threat of Bitcoin.
B2X: many consider B2X as the biggest threat of Bitcoin in its history.

Let's say a fruit trading network trades apples only. One of the rules is that the goods must be apples (of any kind).
A soft-fork example would be that some people in the network want to trade red apples only and they tighten the rule to be that the goods must be red apples. The other people, who don't upgrade their software for any reason, including not following the technology closely, have no problem with the new rule because red apples are apples.
A hard-fork example would be that some people want to trade apples and oranges. They modify the software by loosening the rule. The other people, who don't upgrade their software, consider the goods delivered from the hard-forked software illegitimate because some goods are not apples.

I'm quite new to Bitcoin. Have only been into it for about four months. So I don't know everything about Bitcoin.
Block propagation and orphan blocks sound like valid obstacles to the idea. Never thought of those. Inflation rate is not changed. There is no point raising a solution by changing the whole thing.
I'm thinking that Bitcoin as settlement layer is a consequence of years' discussion yielding no good solution. I've read about Lighting Network, although not in details. (I am not interested in SegWit because I've read it's (kind of) hacky. For that reason I haven't read into SegWit.) I don't think Satoshi would approve any hacky workaround. For Bitcoin being settlement layer, I am not sure it's Satoshi's original attempt and if he would like it. Of course it will be valid if there is no other option.
Risks such as DDoS and block withholding are better off discussed by experts. As I said I'm a noob.
This is my own idea. I thought of posting it to the community. But I know tons of top notchs in this field have contributed their brain energy into this long-lingering problem, so most likely it has been discussed and denied. If OP didn't bring up this question, I might still be wondering if I should post it and if it would work. So, no, there is no paper out there discussing this idea. Do you think I should/could write one? Do you think it's worth being brought to the attention to the Core team?

Yes, users decide what rules (or rule changes) and consequently the chain they accept.
The fact that it's extremely hard to make every user keep up with upgrades/changes of the software and the fact that people tend to stay with what they have agreed with determine that the software/protocol without changes is Bitcoin.
Unlike soft-forks, which don't require all nodes to upgrade, hard-forks require all nodes to upgrade. Any node not upgraded (changed) will be on different (original) chain. That's why hard-forks require consensus (everyone must agree).
If a hard-fork tries to persuade people to replace their software, it's simply not Bitcoin.
It's also why you should stay with current rules if you are uncertain (when there are forks).

They say there are two Bitcoin "brands", one being "Bitcoin Core", which is the original and only Bitcoin, the other being "Bitcoin Cash", which is referred to by lots of Bitcoiners to avoid the intentional misleading. Bcash and many other contentious forks are created to undermine Bitcoin because it take away power and businesses of many people. Roger, his businesses (including Bitcoin.com), his subreddit (the Twitter handle  which is thought to be bought by him, all serve the same purpose.
You can learn about Bcash in a quick way by reading the following summaries:
1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the starting of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.
Bcash does not resolve any problem in Bitcoin. Every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.

The blockchain doesn't know which wallet an address belongs to.


He has to have the private key to the address to access the coins in it.


It isn't. A wallet is a key management app. It manages keys (thus manages addresses and coins in them).


Practically zero, as long as the keys/addresses are generated securely (by using cryptographically secure random numbers and following necessary/best practices).

Miners have their own nodes. They add new blocks to their own nodes, then broadcast the blocks to the network.
Ordinary nodes check the blocks received for validity. The blocks may or may not be deemed valid, depending on if the rules followed by miners are the same as enforced by the nodes.
Nodes are users. Ideally every user should run his own node. Users check their own nodes to tell if their transactions are processed correctly. Technically miners can set and follow any rule. The reason why they don't go rogue is because users won't accept it. This is why we say nodes rule.

I don't understand how the delayed spendability affects S2X miners.
So at S2X block height 497484 (the first S2X block) the miner will sell coinbase of BTC block height 497384 for their running cost; at S2X block height 497485 he will sell coinbase of BTC block height 497385; ...; at S2X block height 497583 he will sell coinbase of BTC block height 497483 (the last block on both chains); starting from S2X block height 49584, he will sell coinbase of S2X blocks.
There doesn't seem to be money flow problem caused by delayed spendability alone.
It's simplified so that there is only one miner, but I think you get the idea.

Agreed. Fairly speaking, a rescue (or any) fork without consensus under any circumstance can be a great choice (to the forkers) as long as they don't claim it to be the original coin/chain.

It's a common sense that the blocksize will have to increase at some point. There is no doubt that Core devs would think so. And as a matter of fact, most of them do think so.
Increasing blocksize helps centralization, which is the problem Bitcoin tries to solve. It has to be the last resort, especially considering it requires a hard-fork. The blocksize is enough at this stage.
The goal of the endeavor to push bigger blocksize right now is to take over control of Bitcoin.

The hard part is to identify the backdoor. Since it's closed source, people don't even understand how the supposed functions work. If a reverse engineering is done, the first thing is to figure out is how it works. Only after that can backdoors be studied. Moreover, there might not be a backdoor. It might just be an intentionally built weakness known by the manufacturer or a three-letter agency only. Such a type of exploit can be extremely hard to find, especially if it's a mathematical one.
 


You have to trust this parties. It's not the spirit of Bitcoin.


I've read some reports about Trezor's issues. None of them actually mattered. I'm not aware of any losses.
I've learned that security is a work-in-progress. One of the reasons why security exploits are easier to find in Trezor is that it's fully open source - it's easy to examine every part of it. Secure Element, which plays the major part in Ledger cannot be examined.
Ledger isn't free of such issues. There are reports, too. One of them is that Ledger showed 8 characters of the addresses only, which was unbelievable.
In addition, just because no report about exploits of Secure Element doesn't mean it's secure. I believe it's a common understanding that security protocols should be established in an open manner, and obscurity isn't security, which is partially why Secure Element is considered secure.

It was fuckery of a very small proportion of users of Ethereum, who happened to be the richest investors of Ethereum. Yet every user of Ethereum had to pay for it.

The data sheet literally means nothing. There are tons of ways to embed backdoors in a closed source products. The secure element is very likely readable to the its manufacturer and potentially readable to the hackers who have broken it.
It's well established and acknowledged that only by being open can a system be secure. Modern security standards, such as AES, SHA, and so on, are all open, aka, in the wild, freely being attacked, some being proved weak and replaced with better ones. In fact, attacks are welcome. This is how security is achieved. On the other hand, Enigma, the pinnacle of closed source security, was widely thought to be secure and unbreakable, but it was actually broken while its users, the German military, sending every secret as plain texts through it to their enemy. And that's just about the vulnerabilities, not the backdoors.

The only feasible attack on Bitcoin so far is to hijack Bitcoin or its name. To hijack the name, hard-forks are inevitable. There will be more (attempts at least).
The idea is whoever doing so are not really a part of the community. Hard-forks are not a sign of division of the community, at least not a fork like SegWit2x. delivers the idea clearly and concisely: SegWit2x is an altcoin, not a hard-fork.

Point 1: The rich can get richer when Bitcoin becomes the global currency, and it's a problem of Bitcoin.
The rich get richer by 1) manipulating the money and directly profiting from it, 2) manipulating policies/laws that give their businesses advantages, or 3) maintaining the monopoly their businesses have. In Bitcoin, 1 is impossible, unless the users allow it. (Redistributing Satoshi's coins is a good start, by the way.) 2 and 3 are not money problem therefore cannot be solved by money, and it doesn't matter what money is used. So it's not a Bitcoin's problem.
Point 2: Some super rich people will own the majority of Bitcoin and it will make other people's lives miserable.
The super rich owning the majority of money does not change the life quality of the other people. Money will simply be more valuable, i.e., the same amount of BTC will be able buy more stuff. We are already in a state that a very small proportion of people own the most of money, but people only suffer because money is manipulated.
Point 3: Because Satoshi is rich and powerful, let's take his money, just in case he is one person, alive and bad.
What should I say?
Point 4: Bitcoin (money) needs to solve the Bitcoin (money) distribution problem, and it can be done by manipulating Bitcoin (money).
Both are bankers' logics.

I've been playing with RaspiBolt tutorial. I've got some questions about LND. The official documentation is hard to interpret.
- Is there a command to get all used addresses?
- Is there a way to check if an address belong to my wallet?
- Does newaddress command always generate a new unique address? Is there an upper limit? Is it safe to use an address after skipping, let's say, 100 addresses?
- I had two addresses with 0.01 tBTC (acquired from the faucet in the tutorial) initially. They were both spent by auto-pilot, if I understand it correctly. Is it normal?
- The coins were moved to two addresses, one with exactly 0.008 tBTC, which is not in channel, the other with a little less than 0.012 tBTC, which is in channel. Does LND testnet auto-pilot have a upper limit of 0.012 tBTC for channels? Is there a reason for such a distribution?
- Does LND/auto-pilot automatically use unused addresses in the wallet when creating channels?
- What's the address type of np2wkh? Why does the tutorial use it instead of tc1, which, according to the tutorial, is supported by LND, when creating new addresses?
- Is there a way create new addresses of tc1 type, namely bech32 format, with newaddress?
- Does LND/auto-pilot always use tc1 address type for receiving addresses for channel closing?
- It appears that LND/auto-pilot always involves the addresses that are not in channels with the receiving addresses from channels when creating channels. (My 0.008 address and its successors are involved.) Is it normal? Why does it do that?
- It appears that tc1 addresses that are in channels are longer than the ones not in channels. Is it true? If yes, why?
- Is it normal that walletbalance does not include the funds in the channel? Is there a way to get the balance in channels?
- How can I get my node's public key, as asked by Y'alls when writing new articles?
- For some reason, user admin cannot do "sudo journalctl -f -u lnd" (no channel updates found for short_chan_id=...) and "sudo tail -f /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/testnet3/debug.log" (socket recv error Connection reset by peer (104)). What did I do wrong? How can I fix it? According to my understanding, user bitcoin cannot do them because it's not a root user.
- What's are the commands to delete the current wallet completely and recreate a new one?

Hardware wallet and multisig are not exclusive.
You can use multisig with desktop/mobile wallets. You can also use multitsig with hardware wallets. For example, Electrum, a desktop/Android wallet, supports multisig with hardware wallets.
It's hard to compare a multisig desktop/mobile wallet with a singlesig hardware wallet. A knowledgeable security-aware power user can potentially have better security by using a multisig desktop/mobile wallet, especially when using it in the offline air-gapped mode. However, for general public, a singlesig hardware should be more secure than a multisig desktop/mobile wallet.

To answer the question you *only just raised after you lost*, there is no Trezor vulnerabilities *that can not circumvented*, and there are multiple ways to handle to vulnerability that you refer to. It's also a proof that Ledger's team is incompetent because they said there was no fix.

Firstly, gold isn't zero-inflation.
Secondly, the effect of the gold standard was not zero. It was the biggest hurdle of FRB. Otherwise, FRB wouldn't have to tried (and succeeded) to void it so that they could do whatever they wanted.
Thirdly, the gold standard couldn't stop inflationary money not because it's useless. It's because inflationary money is a monster too big for it to handle. The gold standard was not make to fight inflationary money. Inflationary money, on the other hand, was made to kill it.
With that being said, you are right about one thing. The gold standard didn't help with the technological advancement. That has happened on its own.

A) The bug in Bitcoin was a bug of Bitcoin itself. The bug in DAO was not a bug of Ethereum. It's a bug in DAO's smart contract. But the hard fork was on Ethereum protocol level.
B) The fix for Bitcoin's bug without a doubt had consensus. The hard fork in DAO was highly controversial to say the least.
C) There were signs that DAO was implemented and executed too hastily. ETH foundation pushed it because of their greed.

Buying a second Ledger is a good idea. In fact, you should buy a Trezor instead of another Ledger if you choose this method, in case Ledger has some security issue.
In addition, you can store smaller amounts in other less secure means: offline multisig Electrum, paper wallet generated offline (read  before proceeding), and so on.
Search Glacier Protocol.
And store multiple copies your seeds and passphrase separately and securely.

The users collectively own the network. Saying that is not an attack is simply ridiculous. Period.


The castle is not battle proven on day 1. 51% attack is the only weakness of Bitcoin and it's well known.


We don't need another castle. We only need different means of defending the castle. And the new castle (fork) will have the same weakness.


We sure can. But remember my argument is Bitcoin may need a PoW change to survive the attack. How are we going to know who is correct, if Bitcoin loses when no PoW change is introduced?
Scenario 1: 51% attack is weak/short. Bitcoin survives without a PoW change: both of us are correct.
Scenario 2: 51% attack is strong/long. Bitcoin survives with a PoW change: I'm correct. You can claim you are not incorrect and I can't argue with that because your way isn't tested.
Scenario 3: 51% attack is strong/long. Bitcoin doesn't survive without a PoW change: Now what? I'm not proven correct, neither are you.
Scenario 4: 51% attack is strong/long. Bitcoin survives without a PoW change: You are correct, and I'm not.

Let's revisit what you said before. Apparently you thought "open source" means "open source *code*", that's very laughable. With such ignorance, you had the audacity to lol. Did you just do some internet research or talk to someone who is more knowledgeable? You can't possible be able to come up with the latest comment yourself.
Even after your researching/consulting, you still failed to understand what open source mean. Is your screen open source? Is your USB cable open source? If they are not, does open source not exist?


It's a non-issue if you use passphrases. Ledger has vulnerabilities that they refused to fix. And that's not even the point. Being closed source means vulnerabilities at best, and backdoors at worst. It's widely acknowledged that security can only be achieved by being open. It's one of the golden rules in security.

Because MCU is generic. It's designed for general purposes. The technologies are well studied and widely used. It's very hard to put a back door in there for a specific purpose. Trezor's MCU supports 1MB memory. How is it going to leak 1MB of data? Secure element supports 16 bytes of data. It can be leaked within a brink of eyes.

As far as I know some PoW change proposals have been raised and people have been working on them. I'm not sure how much Core are involved. But as solution providers, they must have been working on the solution. I believe the solution is ready. The question is when to deploy it.
About the supplier centralization, I don't have a good solution. We can wait for new plumbers (e.g., Japanese 7nm stuff) to appear. And while waiting, we just have to coexist with the plumbers who often switch their jobs. Core may come up with a solution to difficulty fluctuations. As long as they don't attack our home, we can't fire them.
It doesn't matter how much we want to get rid of Jihan. If we have that right to fire someone arbitrarily, he has it, too.
Even if miners attack Bitcoin, a PoW change will still induce criticism, from all sorts of enemies of Bitcoin, saying that there is no consensus and the hard-fork creates an altcoin. We will have a big fight then. That's what I worry about.

Same results at present, different results in the long term. With Samourai's practice, the developers can track all the future transactions of its users. They may even sell the master public keys to, e.g., IRS. This is a huge violation of user's privacy.

Just to clarify the second paragraph: When an address is not used, its public key is undisclosed. For example, the addresses in the legacy address format, P2PKH (pay to public key hash) are hashes of public keys. ~~It's the same in other formats.~~In other formats, the public keys are not disclosed, either. When an address is used (the coins in it are spent), the public key is disclosed (in order for the network to verify the spending). Hash functions are quantum computing resistant. Calculating private keys from public keys is not. This is why coins in new addresses are safe against quantum computers and reused addresses are not.

If some companies can collude so that Bitcoin network doesn't function well, it is centralized. It is as simple as that.
Moreover, with moderate centralization, colluded miners can launch 51% attacks. 51 attacks are bad, but they still follow Bitcoin's rules. SegWit2x is at the totally different level. It is miners collude to change Bitcoin's rules. If that's OK, what about they collude to remove 21m limit? What can't they do?

The PoW algo used by Bitcoin is quantum computing proof. It's the digital signature algo that is not. The PoW algo is symmetric cryptography. The digital signature algo is asymmetric (public-key) cryptography. Only the latter is vulnerable to QC. QC can reverse the key calculation, namely it can calculate the private key given the public key quickly.
In other words, QC will not affect the mining. However, it can be used to steal all funds from reused addresses. Unused addresses are not affected because the last step of generating an address is hashing, which is symmetric cryptography. Used addresses have their public key revealed (the hashing is undone), thus are vulnerable to QC. If QC is fast enough, it may be used to 51% attack any coins that are just spent.

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin.
What was Bcash when it was created?
In a nutshell,
1. Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.
2. This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced more miners than every other competitor and potential all of them combined in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?
Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. Bcash developers even failed to remove SegWit related code completely. Bcash's dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm was so buggy that it took few seconds to mine a block, while it should be around 10 minutes, and lots of blocks were mined at that speed. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may also include bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and  Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.
There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC (BCH) and BcashSV (BSV). Bcash (BcashABC) was 51% attacked by two pools and its blockchain history was modified. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.

I'm fully aware of the vulnerability. You are wrong because Trezor does NOT *leak* its key. The key is *extracted*. I was talking about leaking sensitive information intentionally by the manufacturer, which is totally feasible for secure element but nearly impossible for a generic MCU.


Wrong. If the user believes secure element is secure, they won't use a passphrase. Have your seen any hardware wallet manufacturers push using passphrases?


Totally wrong again. There are three ways to work around it:
1. Make passphrase mandatory and use a good passphrase strength verifier.
2. Build an amnesia (or stateless, as a recent DIY hardware maker calls it) mode, which never saves the seed (or anything else sensitive for that matter).
3. Never leave your seed on the device. Wipe the device after each use.
The first two requires the developer do their job. The second one *is a patch* because the seed is impossible to extract. The third one can be done by anyone and it can achieve the same security as the second one.
As a matter of fact, the vulnerability has never been a problem with me personally because I never leave my seed on the device. I always wipe the device after I'm done. And I had been doing it *before* the vulnerability was found.


I am saying believing that your device (e.g., secure element) is safe and fully relying on it is more dangerous than assuming the system may not be safe and not fully trusting it (including open source standards).
I'm saying the thought that the vulnerabilities and backdoors are unproven is a lot more dangerous and wrong than the belief that security is a work-in-progress and you need to keep doing your diligence.
I'm saying the best security is that no data is present, not that the data is encrypted with "the most secure technology".


As mentioned above, this is literally and factually wrong. No one could extract the seed of mine (or anyone using the same practice) even if the device is in the hands of the best hackers in the world. This is true even if Ledger did not disclose the vulnerability.
You should tell yourself that since you are using secure element and it is certainly vulnerable and likely backdoored.

I believe Bitcoin will never be able to have any hard-fork that's not dead-or-alive critical because the attackers won't allow us to do it. They will make it look like there is no consensus. All improvements have to be done with soft-forks. I'd like to be wrong about this.

How does signing messages (edit:) and the verification work since there is the hashing at the end of generating the address therefore the public key is inaccessible?
I understand basics of signing in public key cryptography. The signer signs a massage with his private key, and gives out the signed message alongside his public key. The public key must be available for the verification.
Does it work the same in Bitcoin? If yes, does it mean ~~signing~~verifying a message with an unspent address is impossible without the signer explicitly disclosing the public key? I understand that spent addresses have their public key disclosed and accessible on the blockchain.

What same situation? Trezor is open source, Ledger is not. Trezor is studied way more than Ledger.


I didn't claim that. I claimed there is no issues at the moment, which is a fact.


This means nothing. If there is nothing wrong with the hardware, it won't be just one person. Unless there is solid evidence, I don't think there is any issue with Trezor.
Not to mention that it might be a shill. The positive exposure of Ledger in Reddit is abnormal.


I won't say it again. Any hard-fork without consensus, including but not limited to SegWit2x, is not Bitcoin. It is a fact. It is not an opinion. There is no politics. The reason you say so is you are either uninformed/misinformed, or you have an agenda.

Of course, it supports passphrase. All Bitcoin HD wallets support passphrase. It's a part of BIP32/BIP39 standards that are established by (guess who) Trezor.
My question is not whether passphrases can be used. It's whether any hardware wallet manufacturer using secure element pushes the use of passphrase as if it's a must. If not, their wallets are not secure because secure element is definitely vulnerable and likely backdoored.


Right, now we are talking about UX. I vaguely remember we were talking about security. /s


LOL. You convinced me. I'm so scared now. My seed is definitely going to be stolen by I don't know who. /s

Really? Are you five? Let's just talk about Bitcoin. Have you heard of AntBleed? Is it not a backdoor, or is it leaked by the developer?


Are they pushing passphrase by saying secure element is not secure (enough)?

Yes, anyone can fork Bitcoin and change it. But it's no longer Bitcoin if it's incompatible and not everyone agrees.
The devs have massive influence in the community. If they are compromised, Bitcoin can be changed. The key is the name of Bitcoin. If it's lost, the faith in such a decentralized system will be shaken even if a fork can pick it up and continue it's course.
Bitcoin is not democracy. It requires consensus to make incompatible changes.
@_date: 2019-09-08 09:09:13


This is technically true. It's as true as the following statement: there can never be absolute security. However, taking what the statements imply is wrong. If you don't pursue security, which is possible and recommended, you will end up not having security. If you don't pursue open source hardware (or software), which is possible and recommended, too, you will end up getting easily monitored, manipulated, and/or exploited. If you accept "there can never be absolute security", you would not even be using or recommending Coldcard.
There is no apparent security issues, both vulnerabilities and backdoors, with the closed source components used in Trezor because they are general purpose and the technologies used are well studied, but secure element is a different story. As a closed source technology that's not openly studied and attacked, there are likely security vulnerabilities. But backdoors is a much bigger question mark. Some believe it has long been backdoored.

Because the app isn't hacked. It just has a security vulnerability.
The wallet software communicates with the server it connects to and receives all sorts of data/information.
It can receive texts to be displayed to its user. The texts can be in rich text format, which supports clickable web links, and the message box supports displaying of texts in the format. This enables the scammers to forge deceptive messages to trick the users who connect to their servers to think that the message is generated by the wallet software itself and the download link is legit.
It's said that the scammers use the botnet they control to run the scam, and they also DDOS the genuine servers to get them offline in order for their scam to be more successful.
I suspect the servers aren't functional Electrum servers of any kind. The software might only implement the client-server handshaking part and the error/warning/download-link part. Being lightweight makes it run better on the botnet.

Bcash (BCH) is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin. In a nutshell,
1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.
Bcash does not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It is an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.

The type of the algorithm, e.g., DES, AES and so on, determines the fundamental security of encryption. An algorithm is considered secure if and only if it's publicly studied and well tested/verified. Any other algorithm, including proprietary ones, is considered insecure and history has proven so many times. They are insecure because a trained good attacker may be able to break the algorithm itself by finding mathematics pitfalls in the algorithm, **without using brute-force**.
The key-length (128-bit, 256-bit, etc.) determines the security **against brute-force** within same algorithm. In general longer keys provide better security. A key with 128 bit length has 2^128 possibilities. A successful brute-force attempt will have to try 2^128 / 2 = 2^127 = 1.7 * 10^37 times in average. For 256-bit key, it's 2^256 / 2 = 2^255 = 5.8 * 10^76 times.
What kind of script are you talking about? VBA? Anyway, I'd assume it's massively slower than assembly, C and C++. I assume professional hackers don't use scripting languages to brute-force passwords. When it comes to brute-force, speed is the key.
By the way, SHA is a hashing algorithm, not an encryption algorithm.
Edit: early Office uses short key-length RC4 encryption. The algorithm is proven insecure, let alone the key-length.

Why are ransom payments illegal? People pay ransom all the time. They pay ransom with police knowing/watching (in those cases that they call the police and decide to pay the ransom). I'm sure police knows about crimes better than you. Edit: ignore this part since there was misunderstanding. You can't simply illegalize something because it is mostly used for crime (assuming the main use of Bitcoin is for ransomware), let alone it is not the main part of the crime. It removes good people's right. It kills innovation. And things change. Criminals may use something instead.
Ransomware existed before the existence of Bitcoin. Bitcoin just happened to be most desirable payment method of the hackers, *at the moment*. Malware existed earlier. Viruses existed even earlier. One way or another, the maliciousness is going to continue. Revenue is *not* the only drive. All bad-ware before ransomware gives the makers no financial benefits.

For 3: You are talking about current reality that Bitcoin helps crimes, and ignoring all the possibilities.

And you've proved exactly what I mean: you can't blame a medium or a tool because it helps with crimes. Now I'll show you how Bitcoin can beat money-related crimes, which Fiat has failed. Use current Bitcoin, without many modifications, make it official money (rather than illegalize it), add just one law: all users/people must be registered to use bitcoins. Now most, if not all, money-related crimes will be gone! Why? Because whatever means you use to get the money (bitcoins) illegally, stealing, robbing, whatever, it's on the blockchain. It's traceable. You will be discovered. Now you may say that this defeats Bitcoin's anonymity feature. Well, it is not that important, if stopping crimes is what we really want. This is also why we don't simply kill innovations because of some drawbacks, because they create all sorts of possibilities.

Blockchain is not cloud based. In fact, it's the opposite of cloud/server based. It's a peer-to-peer database. It exists on every peer/node.
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency. It runs without a server - the centralized party. No party alone decides the rules in Bitcoin. The rules are decided by the network, i.e., the consensus of all nodes.
In order to prevent spamming, there is a 1MB blocksize limit. It has been in Bitcoin for ages. Since more and more people start to use Bitcoin, the limit becomes a bottleneck. To solve the scaling problem, SegWit utilizes a smart engineering approach so that the *effective* blocksize limit size becomes 4MB without breaking the old 1MB blocksize limit rule. The new *effective* limit uses the term "weight".
There has been a war between SegWit and direct blocksize limit increase, which is another way of scaling. In a nutshell, SegWit is superior in almost every way. Direct blocksize limit increase is not only inferior but also dangerous because it makes Bitcoin centralized, which is the only way to kill it. Direct blocksize limit increase and its derivatives, such as Bcash, aka "Bitcoin Cash", are pushed by corrupt miners and enemies of Bitcoin.

That's informative. Thanks.
I don't understand why empty blocks can be mined. It must be considered to be contributing to the network. Is it because it helps to secure the chain? In real-life, do miners mine empty blocks?
I thought block-size issue is that with the adoption of Bitcoin increases, current 1MB block-size starts to get full therefore it becomes the bottleneck of Bitcoin's further adoption/expansion. Maybe I was wrong? Or maybe the two issues are tightly connected since if the block-size is simply increased there will be network latency/propagation issue?
Do you think the following idea will work to solve network latency/propagation issue?
With split-chain solution,  when a miner starts to mine a block on the second chain (PoW chain), he has to publish the corresponding block on the first chain (TX chain) some time before he publishes the mined block. All nodes will keep downloading all the candidate TX blocks from all miners, and when receiving a mined block they will check the time difference between receiving TX block and PoW block. If it's bigger than let's say 5 minutes, the PoW block will be denied or delayed-accepted until time difference is 5 minutes. (Actually it doesn't have to be split-chain, there should be a way to do the same thing for current single chain.)
I foresee two potential issues:
1. The bandwidth required to download all the candidate TX blocks from all miners may be so high that the design won't work. Even if it works, the network may be vulnerable to attack. (Potential solution: in some way miners are made to prefer to choose from existing candidate TX blocks rather than creating new TX blocks.)
2. If some nodes accept some blocks (because they meet the time difference criteria for them) and some don't (because they don't meet the time difference criteria for them), there will be forks. (Potential solution: no idea. How are forks resolved currently?)

I'm confused. Is there a way to solve the problem without getting all relevant information to the miners? All I know is that spying mining doesn't require all information. But it's a different problem.
The problems solved/ameliorated and the benefits provided by the split-chain solution include:
1. Scalability problem with fixed block-size and predefined growing block-size. It's hard to find good block-sizes that work well both short term and long term. The split-chain solution doesn't have this problem. A block can contain any number of TXs. It provides virtually unlimited scalability.
2. Centralization issue (big miners prefer big blocks). The blocks on PoW chain are very small. (Not sure about this one, though.)
3. Energy consumption issue. Since PoW blocks are very small, energy consumed is reduced dramatically. This also applies to the hashing time. It's impossible to hash a block with millions of TXs on current single blockchain. But it makes no different on split-chain scenario how many TXs are in a block.
4. If split-chain solution can work, one PoW blockchain for all cryptocurrencies/distributed-ledgers is viable. We can decouple PoW blockchain from Bitcoin. Bitcoin's blockchain will be the tx chain only, same as all other coins/ledgers. PoW blockchain, which is independent from Bitcoin can provide validation of Bitcoin's blockchain. And since all PoW hashing power serves this one chain, it will be more secure, for all coins/ledgers. (In this scenario, blocks on PoW chain consist of information of multiple cryptocurrencies/distributed-ledgers.)

So yes, they supported SegWit2x.

Address issue is just a minor technical issue, compared to the system of Bitcoin.
There can be other options, which I'm not gonna explore/argue (not because I can't).
What's important here is that with limited number of minor modifications, instead of being arguably a "crime promoter", Bitcoin can definitely serve as a "single-point crime terminator".

I'm not sure about this. Source? Either way, it's the hijacking and asking for ransom that are the core crime.


There were safe ways. They are just not as convenient, I suppose. Bottomline is that ransomware doesn't need Bitcoin to survive. You don't know how the history will develop. Without Bitcoin, there may not be ransomware, but there may be "deleteware", which simply delete all files, since there is no payment collectible. The damage may be bigger.


You vastly underestimated the power of Fiat/money when it comes to crime. Most crimes are due to money. The only crimes that are not include sex-related, and hatred-related ones, which are minority. And since Fiat is the major form of money, shall we illegalize it?

Core devs don't have full control over the technical implementations or protocol changes. There are many members (a lot more than Core devs) who are competent enough to understand what's right and what's wrong in some aspects, e.g., it is super easy to tell that increasing base blocksize is inevitable at some point. You don't need to be a great chef to know some practices in cooking are good/bad. The community as a whole will make a decision when the time comes.
With that being said, I do have a concern that a hard fork to increase the base block size when it's necessary (or any other non-life-or-death hard fork, e.g., improvements) may be blocked by "some members of the community", who are actually enemies of Bitcoin in disguise. They may succeed because hard forks require overwhelming support. They will try to make it like there isn't.

This topic will always attract Bitcoin haters who pretend to be Bitcoin supporters with different opinions. Any sane person would know that software dies without devs. Attacking devs to this degree reveals the true incentive.
@_date: 2018-04-29 10:52:16
There is no coin called "Bitcoin Core". It's Bitcoin. The Bitcoin haters use the name to confuse users.
Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin. In a nutshell,
1. Bcash is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.
Bcash does not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It is an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.

Well, at least who was discussing the same issue with me in this thread, said that the chain must exist before it can be blacklisted.
There is also advice given to an early altcoin that's under attack that they could use checkpoint technique before their network is mature. I assume Bitcoin network is mature so their is no such technique currently existing in Bitcoin.
These are the prove and the research I've got.

Thanks for the long explanation.
I can't say I understand everything you've said. But this part is my biggest question mark:  


How? There is no existing code doing that. When it happens and people are informed, most, if not all, of the blockchains are overwritten with the new malicious one. How can it be reverted?
One way that I can think of, following your idea, is that some of us backup the blockchain regularly. When the attack happens, the backed-up one is put on the internet. Then devs work on a fix to invalidate the malicious chain while validating the old one. Is it what's in your mind?
I can't think of a way that the consensus can be done to defend such kind of attacks when it is happening. Is there a way?

The answer is BIP39.
The seed of BIP39 (24 or 12 words) is all that's needed to access to your coins. There is no need for saving any file or keeping a hardware device. It's a standard. Most wallets support it.
If hardware wallets are not an option, I recommend Electrum on an offline computer. Electrum on Tails OS on an offline computer is a good choice.
If you are paranoid, use multisig. For example, a 2-of-2 multisig wallet requires 2 keys (from 2 seeds/wallets) to access your coins. Of course you will have to keep 2x 24 or 12 words safe. If you are worried you may lose one of the seed, use 2-of-3 or 2-of-4 (you get the idea). Only two seeds are needed to access your coins in these scenarios. You can use multiple offline computers, each for one wallet/seed, to maximize the security.
Edit: Note that the default seed schema of Electrum is not BIP39. You need to change it in the option. Another thing to mention is never store your seeds in digital forms. Instead, write them down on paper, or use products like Cryptosteel.

No, your comment speak for yourself. It indicates either your poor intelligence level or your unspeakable intentions.
People owning and using  Bitcoin only has the say as owners and users. They don't have the say as miners. So, as miners, they are not a part of the community. Common sense.
Ver definitely owe the community an explanation. It's a common sense, again.
If you don't understand either if these, you shouldn't try to argue with other people.

Right. :(
I assume having lots of algorithm candidates in order to increase the ASIC development costs won't help because the miners have very deep pockets. So dead end again.
Do you think the devs keeping the secret of the candidates until, say, three months before the switching date is viable? I'm guessing not. Actually, it is not necessary to disclose the candidates. Commitments can be used so that the information of the candidates is only disclosed at the time of the algorithm selection. In that case, miners have completely no time in advance to prepare. Moreover, maybe some cryptographic magic can be used so that only the chosen one needs to be disclosed and the remaining ones can be kept secret until the next selection? The devs will be the centralized point, though.

Increasing the block size with a hard fork while there are other much less risky options is wrong. Increasing the block size in order to persevere a cheat (Covert AsicBoost) by attacking and blocking SegWit is a hostile takeover.

Wait, transaction fee being a percentage of the amount sent? I have had some relevant questions for a while:
Currently one of the biggest advantages that Bitcoin has over banks is that transaction fees are fixed numbers regardless of the amount sent, while banks do the opposite. That's why Bitcoin's transaction fees are extremely low. If Bitcoin's transaction fees are changed to be amount-percentage-based, will Bitcoin lose the advantage (and become another bank in this aspect)? On the other hand, if banks change their transaction fees to fixed numbers, will Bitcoin survive?

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin. In a nutshell,
1. Bcash is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?
Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.
Bcash does not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It is an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.

The only party that can decide the changes of Bitcoin is users. Devs cannot. Not to mention miners who are just paid workers.
Even users, be it majority of not, can *not* make all the changes to Bitcoin. The purpose of Bitcoin, a decentralized currency, is to be kept as long as some (no matter how few) want it to be kept.

No. Centralized (51%) hashrate *is* the threat. More importantly, it's against Bitcoin's purpose - a permissionless currency. A centralized miner is the authority to whom you have to ask permissions.


A direct blocksize increase is replacing a temporary solution with exactly the same temporary solution, with all sorts of risks and drawbacks introduced. SegWit is safe and much more long-term.


It's a misunderstanding that users can decide how to change the software. It's not always true. Bitcoin's core property/feature/purpose is that it's a decentralized permissionless currency. This can't be changed no matter how many people want to change it. What users can change are the improvements and new features that don't jeopardize Bitcoin's core property/feature/purpose.

It does apply to Bitcoin (there is no "Bitcoin Core"). Bitcoin is way way more peer-to-peer than Bcash and it's still striving to make sure as many users run their nodes as possible.

Miners are paid workers. No paid workers is a part of the communities who hire them.

You edited your comment after/during my comment. So I'm rewriting one.
What exactly "truths" about Core did you tell so that you argue you are not defaming Core?
I pointed out facts, which are truths, about Satoshi.
If mining is centralized, Bitcoin has failed. So yes, mining pools and ASIC get Bitcoin to the brink of failure. Core is trying to save Satoshi's legacy. Depending on your level of standard, you can say Bitcoin has already failed, and Satoshi has already failed.
Satoshi is a hero. It doesn't mean he is a god. He made reasonable mistakes in an attempt of an invention, which is totally understandable. Pointing out the fact that his words may be outdated is not defaming him.
Again, what truths about Core have you told that are their mistakes?


Are you joking?
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:27:51
He spent most of the texts explaining it because it's a new idea. It's not a new idea now. PoW is as simple as it is. Providing of PoW doesn't set the rule, neither in Satoshi's time nor now.

If Wladamir decide to do something Core members don't agree on, the members will speak. Have you heard of such voices?
All true Bitcoiners would.
There is no 80% miners. There number is made up. Roger isn't even on board. And he didn't pull himself out of the agreement after he said he wasn't there when the agreement was signed and it's not what he wanted. Another shady action of his.
You have to understand that users, even the majority of them, can't decide all the changes to be made to Bitcoin. They can only decide the changes that don't jeopardize Bitcoin's purpose - a decentralized currency.
UASF is the attempt of users to protect Bitcoin. It's a war. There might be losses. But it's worth fighting.

At least the miners in question have been fiercely attacking Core and trying to change the direction of Bitcoin's development.
Litecoin and Vertcoin are different because they are far from as significant as Bitcoin in any way.

@_date: 2017-05-28 13:52:50
Bitcoin white paper was written to explore the possibility of such a protocol. Even Satoshi might not be 100% sure it'd work at that point. I can safely say that the paper is superficial to many people at this point. Lots of people master Bitcoin's mechanism way better than the paper and Satoshi himself at that time.
Back to your quote.
What's said is about the validation of blocks. It's the protocol itself. It's actually the most basic protocol. It has nothing to do with the changes/additions of the protocol. MASF was introduced by Core - not even Satoshi. It's not in the white paper.
In addition, Satoshi didn't predict the development of mining technologies. In his paper, he assumed each node is a miner, and vice versa. That's totally not the case nowadays. The "decision making" in the quote refers to the nodes, not the miners. Miners do the work. Nodes make the decision.
So, no, miners have no power.
About "wasn't intended": MASF was introduced for smooth transition of soft-fork activation. It activates soft-forks based on miners signaling. It was meant for signaling readiness, not as votes. But it has been abused. It *wasn't intended* to let miners have the power to veto soft-forks.

Get Roger to sign from a wealthy Bitcoin address before making any argument of this kind.

The problem is why don't the current countries break into even smaller ones, because there are different opinions?

SegWit has support from the majority. It is a soft fork therefore there is no need for consensus.
BU has near zero support. It is a hard fork therefore requires consensus.
Completely different things.
And even if they are kind of the same, we still have another option - not having changes, which many people will choose.
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:02:30
A hard-fork can be anything, not just a removal of something in the protocol.
Soft-forks don't require consensus. Only hard-forks do.
Any code change alters the software thus the protocols to some extent. If no protocol can be altered, the software cannot be improved. So the rule about not altering the protocol is not about any protocol, but the fundamental one.
And there is a difference between altering and adding.

1. Core won't do it, not only because they are not a centralized organization (the members might disagree with each other), but also because they know what's right and they the kind of people who do the right thing.
2. Even if such a client were released, the true Bitcoiners would reject it, Core's reputation will be damaged, and they may get fired from developing Bitcoin. Of course altcoiners and other Bitcoin haters will laugh whatever outcome would be.

It sounds reasonable. However, Bitcoin is so delicate that things that sound right may turn out to be wrong. So don't take my words seriously.
On the other hand, finding and coding thousands of secure and suitable algorithms will be a big challenge. There are many prerequisites, such as PoW must be easy/cheap to verify.

According to unofficial information (a comment in this sub), Mycelium would follow the longest chain in BU's case. I doubt they'd support BIP148.
Coinbase refused to sign the agreement to list BU as an altcoin. No way they'd support BIP148.
By the way, there are two levels of supporting: 1) supporting only (or default to) BIP148; 2) supporting both, which basically mean neutral / not standing against BIP148. Your link isn't clear about this, e.g., Leger wallet is neutral.

If I understand it correctly, the original data doesn't have to be a private key. This is where I was confused.
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:50:09
There are two potential hard-forks that I can think of.
Some miners most likely will not comply to BIP148. To ensure their chain is not reorged, a hard-fork is necessary, unless their hashrate is overwhelmingly higher. Since the hard-fork will create another chain split, they may hesitate to do it. I'd say this hard-fork is (very) likely.
If the hostile miners decide to attack BIP148 chain, a PoW change, which is a hard-fork, may be employed. The likelihood of this hard-fork is not high, because it requires a significant amount of hashrate and the hostile miners have to protect their chain with the hashrate. The likelihood may get higher after miners have done their hard-fork, which is mentioned above, because they don't need as much hashrate to protect their chain from being reorged. If the hostile miners have some hidden hashrate, the hard-fork is very likely.

I forgot about the merkle root. Sorry for that.
I guess point 2 and 3 are invalid based on what you pointed out. What about point 1 and 4?
And back to my original question, is there anything wrong with such a solution?
By the way, can a miner mine an empty block and get the reward (12.5 btcs atm)?
Edit: I realized that since I missed out the merkle root, I might have understood the whole block-size problem wrongly. I think point 1 is invalid, too, because of that. Waiting for confirmations. What exactly is the block-size problem?

How insecure is it when a part of the private key, e.g., the first four characters and the last four characters, is leaked with the public key or the address?
@_date: 2016-10-03 13:08:25
I don't understand why miners need to know and check which TXs were included in the last block. But I don't see how it is a problem with the split-chain solution. Miners have both chains. They can go to the last block on the first chain (let's called it the tx chain) and all information is there. There is no information dropped in this solution.
By the way, why do miners need to know and check which TXs were included in the last block? I understand that they need to know and check which TXs are included in the current candidate block.
@_date: 2016-10-22 12:55:31
Each word has 11 bits of entropy. 12 words provide 132 bits. So 2^132 . It's 2^28 times easier than brute-forcing an address, which is 2^160 . 15 words will provide better security than an address (2^165 ).

Bitcoin will increase blocksize. SegWit already did, but I refer to direct blocksize increases here. I don't think any small blocker is against raising blocksize - just not now, not in near future. Bitcoin is doing it the right way. Bcash is just a scam coin created to preserve Jihan's Covert AsicBoost privilege. No matter what it will include in the future, it is not comparable to Bitcoin. The devs will not hug. All contentious forks of Bitcoin ended up with serious bugs. Their devs are laughed at by not only Bitcoin devs, but also  Bitcoin community.

SegWit is many improvements of Bitcoin. It's a soft-fork. It's designed to be activated by miners, as most soft-forks do. The method is called Miner Activated Soft Fork (MASF). Some miners are blocking SegWit for unfair advantages (Covert ASICBOOST).
Users have decided to activate SegWit themselves. The method is called User Activated Soft Fork (UASF).
There are two major UASF for SegWit activation: BIP148 and BIP149. BIP148 is happening. SegWit will be activated in August this year on BIP148 chain. BIP149 is designed to be effective next year.

SegWit has already got the support of the majority.
A hard fork of any kind (Edit: at this stage) will not get anywhere near SegWit.
In addition, SegWit is a soft fork therefore doesn't need consensus, while any hard fork requires consensus.
There is no such thing as more consensus. Strictly speaking, consensus meaning it's 100% agreed. Practically speaking, it means it's 99.9% agreed.

It's because they have their own agendas that's not the best interest of Bitcoin and its users.
Core should not answer to such a request because it will create a precedence.
More importantly, a lot of users don't want a blocksize increase since it's a hardfork and hardforks are risky. Before it's certainly necessary and it's safe, there is no point of discussing it.

Being altcoins means fundamental consensus rules being different, i.e., how the coin works and how/why people accept/validate the transactions.
UASF is a consensus rule change, but not a fundamental consensus rule one. It is related to how the coin adds new features, i.e., the improvements and the advancement of the coin. So it's not an altcoin.

The reason it took so long to find cover AsicBoost is because the theoretical exploit is hard to find/identify. Because it's hard, the blackbox reverse engineering has to be performed. It's not the blackbox reverse engineering that shows down the finding. It is the same for any security exploit. It takes time to come up with the idea.

This is not true. I'm no expert but according to my understanding the new way of second layer solutions doesn't introduce centralization. Only the old way does.


There is a common misunderstanding here. More *decentralized* hashrate means more security. Centralized hashrate is insecure, and the higher the hashrate is, the more insecure it is.


It might be true. But before we experience SegWit. We don't know if there is a need for a direct blocksize increase.

The chain with centralized mining is the less secure chain because the centralized miner is where insecurity originates. The insecurity is inherent and cannot be fixed.
The chain with less hashrate in insecure in the sense that it may be attacked by the centralized miners. But it can be fixed by a PoW change. Not to talk about ethical maybe even legal advantages.

The true reason for some miners to block SegWit and attack Core (by mentioning Blockstream) is to protect their Covert ASICBOOST privilege. But I'll just list some facts about Blockstream here.
Firstly, SegWit is blocked by some miners. Then UASF to activate SegWit (BIP 148, effective this year) was proposed. Then Luke, a Core member and a Blockstream contractor, expressed his stance: he was neutral about BIP 148. Then another UASF to activate SegWit (BIP149, effective next year) was proposed. A while later, Greg Maxwell, a Core member and CTO of Blockstream (so a boss of Luke), expressed that he was against BIP 148 and he looked forward to BIP 149. Luke expressed that he thought BIP 148 was better than BIP 149 after his boss expressed his opinion. At some point, Luke expressed that BIP 148 has reached the point that there was no return, and started to support it. At the moment Luke is pushing BIP 148 and Greg is not.
Now tell me how Blockstream can do their business with Luke being such a loose cannon, if SegWit were their main business and they were (trying) controlling Core and Bitcoin? Why the hell doesn't Greg fire Luke, at least from Blockstream? Why does Greg support the UASF delaying the activation of SegWit for a year? Why is there neither agreement nor announcement of Core about which UASF to go with, not to mention merging UASF code?

UASF doesn't change any of the fundamental protocols of Bitcoin. It's a soft-fork that change how new features and improvements are activated.
The best you can say is that it's a Bitcoin soft-fork activation protocol, or Bitcoin feature/improvement activation protocol. It's a complimentary protocol. And complementary protocols are added to Bitcoin all the time, including MASF. It's a bug fix for MASF.
Bitcoin protocol has a specific meaning. UASF does not alter *the* Bitcoin protocol.

There are things you greedy corrupt people will never understand.


Miners are from greedy corrupt business world. They are the least legit party in Bitcoin.


Miners. Who else do you think could be?

Don't say miners are. They choose to get into the business by themselves, and they've been paid well. Bitcoin and its users don't owe them. Let's be clear about that.


Miners decide nothing.


It's definitely users. Saying "not users" proves your identity as a shill. Because the devs are the protectors of the users and Bitcoin itself, they have a say, too.

Core side makes more sense, but saying it is a little misleading. Bitcoiner side is more appropriate.
Most technical companies in Bitcoin don't support the agreement. Most companies in the agreements are well known to be under control of Jihan/Roger. This is also why it's important to proceed with BIP 148 rather than BIP 149. Given one more year's profits from ASICBOOST, Jihan will be able to buy more companies to make his side bigger, which can mislead some people to believe it's the majority.
The agreement is basically made by one person only - Jihan, no matter how many companies signed it.

Both 51 and 6 are the minimal amounts of hashrate needed. The actual numbers of hashrate owned by the attacker can be higher. There is no limit.
Currently a large amount of hashrate *is* owned by hostile miners. It's a consequence of mining centralization, especially manufacturing centralization of mining hardware.
70% hashrate is controlled by one person. The number means nothing except the severity of mining centralization.

There is no unnecessary high fees, or unnecessary low fees. It's all market decisions. High fees, or low fees, if any, is definitely not a priority. Not to talk about the high fees are a result of the spamming, which serves the purpose for pushing blocksize change.

Besides what are said by pb1x and almlglor,
1. SegWit (accidentally) fixes Covert AsicBoost, a secret advantage that has been exploited by Bitmain and all the mining pools they control. It is why Jihan Wu and his puppets are against SegWit.
2. SegWit enables Rootstock, a smart contract solution that can render Ethereum irrelevant. It is why some people, who are disguised Ethereum stakeholders, are against SegWit.
3. SegWit is a part of sustainable scaling solutions (to a very large scale). All altcoiners hate this. It is why altcoiners, including Ethereumers, in disguise are against SegWit.
2MB hard-fork won't do any of these. It is why it and many other variances are propagated every day.

Nothing you said is happening right now. Miners are to stay because it's Bitcoin. Efforts are being made, by most talented, experienced and knowledgeable people in Bitcoin world.
Don't forget: the reason why some altcoins are getting attentions right now is because they used the code Bitcoin Core developed (pre-SegWit code) and they used the code Bitcoin Core developed (SegWit code) again. Core devs are the de facto leader of a lot of altcoins.

A hard fork requires consensus of *users* because otherwise *users* will be split to different coins.
UASF of SegWit is a way to enforce a soft fork, which is opt-in and backwards compatible. The reason to have it is that some miners aren't enforcing it in the way it was supposed to be done. A chain split may happen. But it's a split between users and the miners.
Another difference is that with a hard-fork the split is permanent. While with UASF, reorg can happen. It provides the miners another incentive to change their minds.

There are known miners supporting SegWit. They will work on the UASF chain. Their hashrate isn't trivial. It's going to move forward.
Although it's estimated that Jihan controls the majority of hashrate, we are not certain. Only Jihan is firmly against SegWit. Other currently non-supporting miners may start signaling SegWit after UASF in active.

Oh, the miner who mines empty blocks wants a bigger block!
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:01:37
When the white paper was published, Satoshi made an assumption that every miner is also a node (and vice versa). The assumption is no longer true.
It's the nodes (and the node parts in Satoshi's assumed scenario) that decide the validity of the blocks. Miners work towards the standards that nodes set up.

@_date: 2017-05-26 23:51:19
There is no compromise in that agreement. Jihan wants to implement a different version of SegWit, which, as everyone can see, is to keep his ASICBOOST privilege.
Again, Jihan is not at the position of offering compromises. He has to comply.
Again, Core can't decide a blocksize increase. In fact, unlike what you've said, Luke did propose a SegWit + blocksize increase hard-fork in response to the agreement, no one has paid attention. That's how powerless Core are in this matter.

Are you being sarcastic, or my question happens to be a known topic in cryptography?


Does it mean the length (the number of bytes) of the data for the second hash is the same?
It sounds reasonable (not science at all, just a guy feeling). Another guy feeling just came to me: if the source data is of the same format, i.e., some bits are always the same, collisions of double hashes may be reduced.


You mean the 1st hash reduces the number of inputs of the 2nd hash, right?
It's really hard to tell if you are sarcastic in general, because of the hoax background.
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:40:59
I know 51% doesn't require 51% hashrate. It's just easier to say. It's similar to when we say the longest chain. It actually means the most worked chain.
@_date: 2017-05-08 01:44:03


What do you mean?

What does it mean?
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:45:26

Will the miners on the legacy chain hard fork? Aren't they afraid of another fork?
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:10:57
It makes BIP148-enabled nodes accept SegWit supporting blocks only, invalidating the blocks not supporting SegWit. In this way SegWit support will reach the threshold and then it will be activated.
Legacy nodes will still accept the blocks not supporting SegWit. There is the risk of a chain split. We'll see.

In the war examples, those gadgets are built for own use, therefore is safe to be studied and copied. Same for the other examples you listed.
The code is Bitcoin is to be shared by all parties. You can't assume the code created by a dishonest/hostile party is safe.
There is no difference between hardware and software when it comes to algorithms/logics. SHA256 algorithm has been thoroughly studied. The AsicBoost patent is published for years. Yet there is the covert way to do it.
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:08:26
Short timeframe is a disadvantage of BIP148 supporters, and the hostile miners. They won't have enough time to deploy their resources to counter such an action.
Frankly speaking, I initially believed that BIP148 would be more messy/risky and less likely to succeed compared to BIP149. But when I realized that given one year's profits, with or without ASICBOOST, the landscape of Bitcoin world may be unimaginably different, e.g., the miners may become the economic majority, or at least they can make economic majority supporting SegWit non-existent, I started to believe that BIP148 might not be that bad.
At the end, it is a decision between two messy outcomes. BIP148 is happening, it works - it scared a new agreement that's not even self-consistent out of the miners, and it has a better future if it succeeds compared to BIP149.
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:58:34
Do you mean that witness data will be hashed as a part of their transactions rather than via coinbase transaction in hard-fork SegWit?
Hardfork SegWit does not stop AsicBoost.
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:49:24
Except yes I know.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:08:23


Let's look at the order of the parties involved: companies &gt; miners &gt; developers &gt; users.
It means, in their view, the most important property of Bitcoin is creating profits for companies. Miners are more important than users and developers. Users are the least important.
In the view of true Bitcoiners, the most important property of Bitcoin is decentralized permissionless currency. Users are more important than developers and miners. Miners are the least important.
So the order true Bitcoiners will go with is: decentralization of Bitcoin, users, developers, companies and miners. Pretty much the opposite.
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:28:42
Because a hard fork at present is risky and many people are against it. Core has no power if there is no consensus.
@_date: 2017-05-06 08:02:47
If Blockstream has similar issues as Roger/Jihan, we do have to consider blocking SegWit and firing Core/Blockstream. The logic is perfectly right.
There is nothing solid about Blockstream that you can blame. No blame about Blockstream that I know of can stand. On the other hand, there are lots of solid evidences that Roger is anti Bitcoin and Jihan is self-interested.
Edit: typo. Roger is anti Bitcoin.

They are defamed rather than notorious.

The miners are just using an existing concept.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:49:19
I thought so, too. But no one seems to be talking about it. Is it because people go BIP148 and nullc's UASF is to be used with BIP149?
@_date: 2017-05-06 04:05:53
It's the right/safe way.
Paper wallets are meant for long-term (cold) storage. It's OK to have the additional cost.
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:13:28


Don't talk like miners and nodes are equal. Nodes run Core code voluntarily. Miners run the code because they have to.


Only some miners are trying to grab power here. Implying Core or any other party except Roger is trying is lying.

One difference with online banking is that there are limits set by banks, for security purpose.
If your online banking password is compromised, the hacker may be able to transfer some funds out from your account, but not all, before you or your bank find out. Then it can be stopped. For bitcoins, it's impossible. If your process is compromised, all of your bitcoins will be gone.
Similarly, if you lose your bank password, the bank can help you to get a new one. With Bitcoin, it's impossible. It's not related to problem we are talking about, but it's the same idea.
The idea is that with Bitcoin, you are your own bank. Then the question would be what level of security you think is proper for a bank - your bank.
It also depends on how much you put into Bitcoin. If it's your life savings, then a good question to ask is: how will you accept it if/when your bitcoins are lost due to an insecure process?

This is not true. Any sensible/experienced software devs can foresee that the blocksize will have to be increased at some point in the future. Core devs aren't more clever than a lot of people on that one.


I don't care about miners. Where did you get that users don't want it?


There are many Bitcoin technology followers. Lots of them are technically capable to judge Core's opinions. Lots of them love and follow Satoshi's vision. They are the main community we are talking about. Regular users don't understand technical details, nor do they care. No regular users wants a blocksize change.


Both sentences are untrue. I have seen with my own eyes what kinds of people claim they want blocksize change. They are either Bitcoin haters, or misled miners, or shills of them. And the number can be Sybil-attacked. (The number is fake.) The real opposing is from the community. Many Bitcoiners understand the risks of hard-forks and refuse to do it. If not all users agree on a hard-fork, it simply cannot be do, because it will cause a controversial chain split, which will be a disaster. Core, as the dev, has the job to at least keep Bitcoin working. They can't risk it.


Just to be clear, Core doesn't always have to listen to users. Core and many Bitcoin followers are firm protectors of Satoshi's vision. Nothing trumps what Bitcoin is created for, including users. I can't speak for Core, but according to my understanding, Core's priorities are as follows: 1. keep the current software and current network working; defend attacks, fix bugs/issues; maintain and promote decentralization; 2. explore improvements and new features, without breaking the software and the network or jeopardizing the decentralization. If any malicious party tries to break Bitcoin by either making the software or the network not working, or jeopardizing the decentralization, even if they are genuine users, Core will work against them, and they will have a lot of supports. If benign users want to change Bitcoin to something different, e.g., a centralized thing, they won't listen, either, and they will have the same supports.

For example, CW is applying for hundreds of blockchain patents. No one in Bitcoin/blockchain field has done that. I believe the number of all the innovative ideas and solutions of Bitcoin devs that are not patented won't be bigger than CW's patent number.
Note that, unlike how some people call him (a patent troll), he is not actually a patent troll because his patents seem to solve specific problems and patent trolls don't. What patent trolls do is they get patents that are extremely generally described. They have absolutely no idea what they are and how they can be used. They just wait for other people to fall into the patent descriptions and sue them for compensations. CW, on the other hand, doesn't do that. Of course, my information about his patents is limited. The conclusion is drawn according to what I have read.

I personally UASFed because there is no consensus in Bitcoin, which is a consensus network. When there is no consensus in a consensus network, the network breaks, the chain splits. I personally UASFed to create an altcoin, with the possibility that miners comply and it stays as Bitcoin.
To me, BIP148 is not about SegWit, at all. It's about taking back control of Bitcoin, or establish an altcoin that carries every bit of essence of Bitcoin and doesn't have its control in the hands of some tyrants.

I think the flaw in their arguments about Satoshi's original vision lies in that they mix technical design and technical implementation details.
What's great about Satoshi and Bitcoin is the technical design and the technical design alone. The design has been proven to be working (except arguably the mining centralization is causing some serious/critical problems), and is the only available solution. There is no alternative. In addition, it takes a Satoshi to come up with the solution and he is superior to other people on it.
The implementation details, such as blocksize limit being temporary, are trivial. They have not been proven working. There are alternatives. In addition, it doesn't need a Satoshi to come up with solutions and he is not superior to other people on them.

It's a relatively safe way that Core developed to activate soft-forks. It was meant to be signaling for readiness, rather than support. But it was abused by some miners (who hired you for the shilling, by the way) and used as a veto power.

No one knows if, when and how the 51% attack will happen. You can't pre-determine a date to fend the attack.

It depends on many factors. The first one is if I'm into Bitcoin for investment or speculation.
If I'm an investor, timing of purchases isn't that important.
If I'm a speculator, I'll try to figure out all the possibilities and their odds. They may not have easy answers, and different persons may have different opinions. I'll also examine my tolerance levels of all outcomes. After that I may make a decision. (The same applies if I'm an investor, but it's not as important.)

The security of Bitcoin's private key is 128 bits, not 256 bits. is incorrect about this. 12 words provide the same security as 24 words in that sense.

The math cannot be reversed.
As a simplified example, you have some private information as 3 numbers: 37,634, 2,513, 9,424,695,385. The address is calculated in this way: address = number 1 * number 2 + number 3. So your address is 9,519,269,627. It's hard to find out what the private information is with the address and the formula.
Of course, the math used in Bitcoin is way more secure than the example.

I am personally against any MASF on BIP148 chain from now on. If other people agree, there won't be the same situations. It will always be UASF.
The reason is miners are the only party in Bitcoin's system that has direct financial interests. Leaving them with even slightest power will eventually corrupt the system, as we have seen.
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:36:49
The goals of BIP148 are 1) (for lots of BIP148 supporters) to practice their will of taking back the control of Bitcoin, or to leave/split Bitcoin if miners don't comply; 2) (for most BIP148 supporters) to activate SegWit.
The goals of BIP91 are 1) to create the illusion that miners are in charge; 2) to avoid financial losses caused by the chain split; 3) (for a small amount of miners, who are the good and sensible ones) to activate SegWit.
There is near-zero overlapping of the goals of the two BIPs. They just appear to have the same goal.
No, BIP148 should **NOT** change to adapt to BIP91, because 1) we, the users, are in charge; 2) the signaling is known to be a game of miners therefore may fall apart any time; 3) BIP91 is the adaption to BIP148.

Core devs have been helping out BU and all sorts of code done by the devs hired by the malicious miners. They and their supporters are neither grateful nor convinced that Core are benign or they need Core. I don't think they will be grateful to the community if we help them. Nor do I think they will start to embrace/follow the community. Let alone that other attackers of Bitcoin will see it as the weakness of the community.

I believe your code is the latest version from GitHub. It's not a stable version. Try 0.14.2. I failed in building it, though. By the way, the latest version executable I built made my blockchain data corrupted when there was a network outage. I have no idea if there is anything wrong with that version of the code, though.
Building Bitcoin Core on Windows is a big pain. I experienced uncountable errors. Every attempt I made (by googling) reached a dead end. For some unknown reason, a previously failed way worked.

Jihan can not only manipulate the price of BCC, but only determine it, since he controls all the exchanges supporting BCC. He can set the prices and the volumes artificially. I can't figure out how this will play out.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:59:23
The scenario that the exchange doesn't match the real orders is faulty. I've removed it from the post. Not sure if it's the broken part you are taking about.
The exchange *can* create fake buy and sell orders, with both matched and unmatched ones (to make it appear more real), that make the price surge (or plunge), without people finding out they are faked. There is no way to tell the fake ones from the real ones.
If many exchanges have the same price movement, people, especially the misinformed and the uninformed ones, will be tricked to believe the movement is genuine and correspondingly change their orders/prices, which will subsequently consolidate such a movement.
Apparently Jihan doesn't control all the exchanges supporting BCC, which is an error in my post, but he does control most of them, which should be sufficient for such a scenario to work.

Breadwallet is likely endorsed by Bitcoin's attackers. They support the longest chain rather than Core chain, which means you may end up on BU chain in the case of a chain split.

Why does block size drop exactly, since the blocks are not SegWit ones?

@_date: 2017-07-06 07:04:56


SegWit2x is a correspondence to BIP148. If SegWit2x is deployed and works, SegWit will be activate and BIP148 chain will be the Bitcoin chain, therefore will have 100% hashrate. The hard-fork part of SegWit2x will simply be ignored by most nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:41:47
That's true. But because we don't have a choice, we have to live with it. We do have a choice about the HP keylogger.
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:01:23
Do you think a human based (rather than computation based) randomness is viable for the scenario the OP described?
The idea is that Bitcoin software/protocol defines that the next PoW algorithm is calculated from some config variable, which is socially agreed to be from some social events, e.g., the result of the last Powerball before PoW algorithm switching date. There can be a backup event in case the default one never happened.
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:44:41
The problem is the idea relies on an assumption that (active) users, or the economy majority, have more BTC than miners. It may be dangerous to make such an assumption.
We assumed miners would use the soft-fork signaling nicely, which seemed reasonable, but it failed.
I'm not totally against the idea, but I'm concerned.
@_date: 2017-07-08 00:31:32
Jihan is paying a lot this month. BIP148 works so well. See the quantity of shill comments and how "mental" they are.
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:31:22
It's true.
They could have forked any time in the history of Bitcoin. It didn't happen. This is not to say it will not happen. Just something to think about.

Why don't you list Ponzi scheme?


Bitcoin has its purpose. It's to serve as a decentralized permissionless currency. It does that job.
Whether it can scale and how well it can scale are much less important issues.


Are you saying they were useless in the day they were being used? Bitcoin will be replaced (or die) one day. That's for sure, because nothing lasts for ever. It doesn't justify anything.
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:07:54

Please don't quit no matter what. Just devise a new software license and create a new cryptocurrency that's guaranteed to be decentralized. You will have a lot of followers and supporters. This is bigger than the rationale of free software, if there is any conflicts.

When did Core decide anything related to UASF?
There has never been an announcement of Core related to UASF and some Core devs have different opinions on which UASF BIP is better.
Luke was neutral to BIP 148 at the beginning. He thinks BIP 148 is better than BIP 149. He started to support BIP 148 a while ago, because, according to my understanding of his words, it has passed the point of no return.
Greg Maxwell is against BIP 148. If I'm not mistaken, he supports (or at least is looking forward to) BIP 149.
Wladimir, the lead maintainer of Core, supports BIP 148.
Shaolinfry, the author of both UASF BIPs as well as the original MASF BIP, favors BIP 149.
There is no even internal agreement amongst Core devs. How can they decide for the community?
(On a different matter, OP is a better quality shill post because it is noble and worth arguing. It has been a while since the last noble argument-worthy shill post/comment.)

2. Enforcers of Bitcoin's purpose agree on no change of the fundamentals of Bitcoin.
3. Inform miners for supports.
4. Flag day UASF.
Like what's going to happen with SegWit.
Edit: more importantly, whether or not I can come up with an idea to solve the problem is not important. MASF is wrong. We need to work on a replacement solution, no matter how hard it will be.
Edit: about big blocks? Technology community believes it's risky. Enforcers of Bitcoin's purpose believe it will jeopardize the fundamentals of Bitcoin. So it's rejected.

That's why SegWit has to be activated therefore Lightning can be deployed. It is also why we can't rely on direct blocksize increase.
Non-trivial means non-spamming.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:52:11
SegWit is blocked and attacked because it invalidates Jihan's AsicBoost.
SegWit2x is introduced to create the illusion that miners decide to activate SegWit voluntarily - not forced by UASF - to show that they are not powerless. The hard-fork is so that people would believe it's genuinely what they want. Jihan still doesn't want SegWit but he has no choice but to accept it (partially - he stated he would put some of his hashrate on his chain).

Keep in mind that the blockchain data grow in size overtime. It increases about 52.5GB per year if SegWit is not activated, or 89GB or 105GB, depending on the estimation of the average blocksize, per year if it's activated.
On the other hand, you can always activate pruning to reduce the blockchain size to a few GB in the case that you run out of disk space.

SegWit/LN will definitely improve the adoption. My point is that without any change, Bitcoin is doing fine.
A hard-fork to increase blocksize is risky therefore should be avoided.
SegWit is a soft-fork therefore is safe. It fixes many issues and comes with many benefits, including paving the way for LN, which provides Visa level scalability. So SegWit is a way to go.

Wrong. The right wording should be "what's rightfully ours".


Miners are blocking an improvement that has overwhelming support from the community, for their cheating benefits. They are not doing their job. Signaling is for readiness, not a vote.


The rule was set to give them some power by the community (the users). Since it's not working, the rule is to be changed with miners power revoked, with UASF. MASF is a bug. UASF is the fix.


Get yourself educated before jumping into an argument.


Bitcoin is not democracy.


Most users want it. Miners are paid workers thus not a part of the community, therefore what they want is irrelevant.

I have no idea what Satoshi's original vision is. (I don't believe what the article says until I find the original evidence.) But here are a few things to consider:
1. Satoshi is greater than other people in one thing, and one thing only. It's that he found a way (Proof-of-Work) to resolve the problem of a fully decentralized payment system. And he is only greater than us before the white paper is published. After it's published and reviewed, many many people have the same level of understanding of the system as him, because it's quite straightforward. He is not greater than many in programming. I believe, according to some signs, his cryptography knowledge and skills are not as good as some of the current Core devs, but since I'm not an expert in cryptography, don't take my words for granted. (Satoshi may be better at inventing than us. But it's irrelevant to the problem we are discussing.)
2. Satoshi is not always correct. He made mistakes. He used IP addresses as wallet addresses at the beginning. He didn't foresee GPU/FPGA/ASIC mining. He didn't foresee mining pools. Both ASIC mining and mining pools have brought Bitcoin to the brim of failure.
3. Bitcoin is a big invention. Before it's proved working, Satoshi wasn't even confident about it. (As a matter of fact, he sought for reviews.) No one could foresee something as big as Bitcoin can develop into. When Satoshi was working on the implementation, all he wanted to check is if it worked. I believe, after so many years of development, the current status of Bitcoin is way beyond his imaginations - he wouldn't have thought that Bitcoin is so successful, the adoption of Bitcoin worldwide is so good, so much money have been poured into the mining business, so many businesses are established around Bitcoin, Bitcoin is worth so much fiat money, Bitcoin has come to a point that scaling is necessary, and so on. He might have said that a direct blocksize increase could be used for scaling, but it must have been based on preliminary/temporary thoughts and without the goal of resolving global level exponentially increasing adoption.
To sum up, I don't think Satoshi's vision matters, no matter if he supported/supports big blocks.

BIP148 is destined to work no matter what when it received sufficient community support. The question is how successful. The less successful scenario is it receives minimal hashrate and the chain splits. The more successful scenario is miners comply and the chain doesn't split.

Bitcoin white paper outlines a great invention. And some parts are certainly outdated. The fundamental parts work, greatly. The outdated parts get Bitcoin to the brink of failure.
Most Core devs agree a blocksize limit increase is inevitable around the track. They just don't consider it a good idea to do it now or in near future.
Core are not deciding Bitcoin's future when it comes to new features. In this case, the community decides. They are, and merely are, the most knowledgeable people in this field (and the coders of course). When it comes to Satoshi's vision, i.e., the purpose of Bitcoin, they are firm protectors. I believe none of them will give in the decentralization nature of Bitcoin, which is respectable.

You existing coins well be on all the forked chains that may occur.
In the case of BIP148 and SegWit2x (together), there may be there forked chains. Your existing coins will be on all three of them.
Yes, you can sell off your coins on one chain and buy coins on another chain, as long as you can find exchanges that support the trades. Another thing to take into account is relay attacks. Your transactions are valid on all chains. If you transact your coins on one chain to an exchange, you will likely end up transacting your coins on all chains. So it's only safe when replay attack protection is ready.

Second, the $ amount fee has a caveat: the wallet should tell the user what exchange it is using for this fee, as different exchanges charge different amounts for satoshis at different times
The price doesn't have to be accurate for two reasons: 1) the price itself fluctuates; 2) it doesn't matter much if it's $2700 or $2800 when the fee is around 0.0001btc - the difference is only $0.01.

I'm curious about the phenomenon that lower-than-standard-fee transactions get confirmed in a few blocks.
I understand it can't get confirmed in the intermediate block because the block is filled with standard-fee transactions.
If, in the time of the following blocks, sufficient numbers (to fill the blocks) of standard-fee transactions are broadcast to the network, how can low-fee ones make their way into the blocks since standard-fee ones can fill the blocks? Aren't they supposed to be delayed indefinitely until standard-fee transactions can no longer fill the block?

SegWit usage is only around 50%. The block size increase brought by SegWit is yet to be fully exploited. Until all major parties in Bitcoin start to use the block spaces responsibly, there is absolutely no point of doing another block size increase.

PoW is invented to make sure no one can cheat on the transaction order, i.e., double spend. It has nothing to do with consensus. Consensus is done by verifying PoW.
If PoW is considered marginally relevant to consensus of the blockchain, it definitely is not relevant to the consensus of new features and improvements of Bitcoin, i.e., soft-forks. It is what's used right now. Bit it has been proven faulty in at least two ways: 1) signaling doesn't guarantee supporting; 2) miners have the ability to block changes that the community wants. It is an experiment, and it has failed to some extent.
MASF is not secure. We need to find a better way.

So? The future alterations will be in the future versions of Bitcoin, therefore require consensus to be introduced, which we don't have. In addition, simply every single true Bitcoiner wants changes (at least improvements), and many (most, if not all, actually) true Bitcoiners want SegWit.


Has anyone threatened anyone in UASF?
If you are talking about reorg, there is no threat in it. The reason for the reorg to be a potential risk is that it may have 51% hashrate. But the chain with 51% hashrate is supposed to win. It's a basic consensus rule that the longest chain wins. In your logic, in any regular day, a longer chain is a threat to a shorter chain.
You are fully entitled to fork Bitcoin, modify it so that it ignores all SegWit-signaling blocks (or any currently legit blocks you like). If your fork gains sufficient hashrate, it will reorg the ordinary Bitcoin. Is that a problem?


So people cannot divorce because children will be victims, right?


It doesn't matter. Until it becomes an altcoin, it's totally Bitcoin relevant, therefore should be discussed in any Bitcoin forum. How can Bitcoin users know about the risks it may introduce without it being discussed in Bitcoin forums?


I don't care to distinguish shills and other enemies of Bitcoin since they are exactly the same in their appearance. I don't like to waste my time to write something like "shills of the malicious miners, (shills of) malicious altcoiners, and possibly (shills of) banksters and/or other malicious parties to Bitcoin" every time I have to name it. So, I use the word "shill" to include them all. As a result, you are a shill, to me.


BIP148 is carried out in a short notice, even if it's counted from the day it's proposed, which it's not. It's a quick move. Time was a luxury. At least the user agent was modified so that it's clear. The software has never been advertised as the official Bitcoin Core software, not that I know of. It's always been introduced as "UASF client" or something like that. There's no misleading.


If you think it's true, you should be uncomfortable with them as much as you are uncomfortable with BIP148, if not more uncomfortable. Have you ever written something so strongly against them? No?
The fact that you only attack BIP148 supporters indicates that you are a shill. Before you write anything against Jihan/Roger/BitcoinCash/BitcoinABC at least as strong this post, you will be deemed as a shill and ignored from now on.
Shills are here neither for reasons nor for the good of Bitcoin. They are here for disruption and sabotage. They are by definition unreasonable and unconvinceable. There is no point discussing with these people. It's why they don't deserve discussions. It's why BIP148 is carried out - we don't discuss (anymore), we act!


Lastly, it's all and only honesty on the UASF side.
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:50:14
I understand what you said, but what are you referring to?
You sell coins (for fiat) to other people. Only when there is a buyer will the deal be made. Because it's a real person who is buying, the seller will receive the fiat, therefore there will not be a withdrawal problem.
The faked deals are faked on both the seller side and the buyer side. Both the seller and the buyer are the exchange, therefore there is no cash-out problem.

The reason why I summarized the post is to have a full understand of the risks of paper wallet, not to discourage it, although many security/Bitcoin experts are against paper wallet.

I agree totally that the fact that some Core devs don't support BIP148, including not merging the code, contributes to BIP148's failure if it fails.
This is not to say that they are responsible to the failure. They sure have their rights to agree and disagree on things. But there is a difference between not supporting something when it's in theory and not supporting it when it's in action and cannot be stopped.
My view of them not supporting BIP148 is elves leaving middle earth for men to fight Sauron alone. Fortunately we (the men) have the help from some of the mighty elves, e.g., @_date: 2017-05-06 02:39:42

I used to believe Craig Wright was Satoshi. But his speech in Future of Bitcoin shook my belief.
I think there are two possibilities now:
1. He is simply not Satoshi.
2. He is the idea man of Bitcoin. He is not fully technically competent. His friend David Kleiman is the main coder.
The second possibility can explain many things, such as David's English is closer to Satoshi's, according to a Reddit post, Satoshi is calm, modest and so on while CW is not, CW can't get some cryptographic tasks right, and so on. I have to introduce some other reasons to explain other behaviors of CW, e.g., he doesn't stick to the decentralization of Bitcoin, though. Edit: To clarify, the Satoshi I referred to is the one on bitcointalk forum, who most people consider as *the* Satoshi. He has to be the coder because the discussions are technically detailed. That Satoshi is David in this case.
I can't fully give up on the idea that he is Satoshi because Bitcoin and blockchain seem to be his thing, if you know what I mean, and the only person who can be so confident to say Bitcoin/blockchain is his thing is Satoshi.

Not "any" but there aren't many criticisms that are real and solid.
The reason is that Bitcoin is in the way of many people, including altcoiners and maybe banksters and Core are protectors of Bitcoin, and Core are in the way of some Bitcoin miners.
The only way for these people to get their ways is to criticize and defame Core in every way they can, in the hope of replacing them or stall Bitcoin's development/advancement.

Agreed, especially this one, although I think it's a little too strong because even with Greg's support of BIP148, there is no guarantee there won't be a chain split. But at the same time, I also agree his support may prevent the chain split.
The reason why I specifically agree with this one is that there is a difference between not supporting a proposal when it's in theory and not supporting it when it's in action and can't be stopped, especially when one's, such as Greg's, support has a significant impact on the outcome.

That's a different issue. You implied that Trezor people attacked Electrum in an unethical way, which is not true.
I use Electrum, too. Theoretically speaking, a fully open source hardware wallet that's made up reputable people, such as Trezor, is more secure, and definitely more suitable for non-techy people, which is the majority.

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin.
What was Bcash when it was created?
In a nutshell,
1. Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.
2. This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced most of all miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?
Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may including bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and  Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.
There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC and BcashSV. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.
Edit: Thanks for the silver!

So what you tried to say is that if &amp;gt;50% upgrade, non-BIP149 nodes who mine illegal SegWit transactions would be orphaned, right?
Just to confirm, if Jihan (or anyone else against SegWit) has more than 51% hashrate, BIP149 will cause a chain split, right? If yes, will his non-SegWit chain suffer the same risk as the legacy chain in BIP148 - the risk of being reorged / wiped out?

According to [History of banking]( the modern form of banking only started to evolve around 600 years ago. Only in the last hundred years has the system become the current shape. The gold standard was destroyed less than a hundred years ago, which was a critical change of the system and has led to worldwide uncontrolled money-printing.
The idea of getting rid of banking is so that people don't live a debt-based life and think it's normal. Yes, people will need loans from time to time, but not every day. Only the really necessary stuff. The most important aspect of the revolution brought by Bitcoin is that people will not be enslaved by a process of money trick that does not help anyone but bankers.

Thanks for the feedback.
What do you think is the reason that PW made such a big effort to research on CSW, who had never been able to prove he was Satoshi, and all the public information related to the creation of Bitcoin to an incredibly detailed level, write a highly detailed story, which discredits CSW, and consistently work against him? What can he possibly gain by doing so?
The link is interesting. I have no idea what exactly happened there. My guess is that PW used some blog posts of CSW that, as claimed by Van Gibson Monroe, PW knew were backdated, hence the criticism.
I've actually addressed the criticism, which Contrarian had, too, some time ago. This is the first time I read that PW attributed his errors to his memory. But when I was addressing the criticism from Contrarian, I used the same explanation as PW's. All provable evidence had been destroyed. His story was written totally based on memory that's years ago. There would definitely be errors. It would in fact be suspicious that the story was perfect. You may find it unbelievable, but, to me, the errors not only don't bother me, but also add credibility.

No, because the blocks will still be full due to spamming.
Some big parties are still wasting block spaces by not using SegWit. Before all major parties use block spaces responsibly, there is absolutely no point of raising the block size.


Increasing block size to 2MB needs working on. It will take a long time to make it happen if we choose so. The code change is easy, but the coordination of node updating is hard because the change requires a hard fork.
In addition, when it happens, many other changes that require a hard fork will also be included (because we don't want to keep doing hard forks, which is inherently risky). This further makes the change take more time.




The storage is not the bottleneck. The bandwidth is. And it's not just about the cost. It's about the time it takes to verify the chain, the centralization of mining due to network latency, and some other factors.

Things evolve over time. Just because there is some forms of money lending/borrowing doesn't mean it is the "banking" we refer to. As I said, only within decades has the banking system taken the current form. Only since then has money printing and debt-based economy become a norm. This is the banking we are referring to.
Homes don't need loans. Within mortgage as a system, most people can still afford homes. The average prices of them would be the current average minus the average of loans. The homes are exactly the same, but people are in a lifetime of debt with loans. This is why loans are bad.
Loans will continue to exist, but only life-saving kind of situations deserve loans.
Lastly, yes, banking will continue to exist, but the majority of it will be in a different form - Bitcoin.

Because some hostile miners have been blocking the development/advancement of Bitcoin, the community came up with the idea (UASF), which has been used some times before, to move Bitcoin forward.
Miner Activated Soft Fork (MASF) is faulty in two ways: 1) the signaling doesn't guarantee supporting; 2) miners can block soft forks that the community wants for their personal interests. Both have happened.
User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) pushes miners to make the move. It's not perfect. But it will solve the problem.

I wasn't talking about the recent reality. Isn't the phenomenon that low-fee transactions get confirmed in a few blocks later a normal behavior when blocks are full? Maybe I miss something.
I have another question, which is related. If blocks are not full, e.g., about 300KB, can I set the miner fee to 1 satoshi and expect my transaction to be confirmed in the next block (or the one after if I miss the current one), since the block isn't full and by including my transaction the miner will have some profit, albeit it's tiny? Is there a reason miners delay mining such a transaction?

There wasn't a lot of information. Basically, the miners with sufficient hashrate can discard his block if the randomness for next PoW isn't in his favor. The explanation of why they can do that without the fear of other miners finding the block wasn't clearly stated, which is what I failed to understand.
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:36:19


Not true. The whole blocksize debate is made up to defame Core therefore stall Bitcoin's development. The miner who started the debate is mining empty blocks.


Hard-forks are always the last resort because of the risks they bear. As long as there is an OK soft-fork solution, no hard-fork should be used.

Miners earn both block rewards, which halve every four years, and transaction fees. To some extent, users compete on transaction fees to get miners to include their transactions. With block rewards falling, transaction fees will rise, keeping miners' incentive intact.

A node is the client software of Bitcoin. The reference implementation of Bitcoin is Bitcoin Core, which can be found at bitcoincore.org. Bitcoin Core can be run on budget low power consumption computer, such as Raspberry Pi.
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer application/currency. A node is a peer. Running a node is the supposed way of using Bitcoin. It serves you, and helps the network (by relaying transactions and blocks). It also helps the survival of Bitcoin.

Because it's an attack to Bitcoin in the first place. Altcoiners like to see Bitcoin hard-forks because they know how chaotic it can be. Some miners like to delay or cancel SegWit because it blocks their AsicBoost privilege.
A direct blocksize increase is not a viable long-term solution. In addition, it comes with significant risks.
SegWit includes a blocksize increase. It comes with many other benefits, including great overs. It is well tested and deployed, waiting for activation.
There is literally zero reason to discuss a blocksize hard-fork at this stage.

Running your node will not stop 51% attacks. The two are totally irrelevant. Running your nodes is to make sure Bitcoin network works the way you agree on as well as you are able to verify it without trusting anyone else.
The bottom line is: Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency and a full node is a peer. Without running your own node (and connect your wallet software to it), you are not using it the way it's supposed to be used.

I'll be downvoted, and I'm not saying I'm certain, because there is no provable evidence.
Here is my theory:
*Based on available sources,* the most likely person who invented Bitcoin is Phil Wilson (Scronty). The solution of Bitcoin was contrived by PW. He was also the main coder, and the (main) author of the white paper. PW suggested go private. He likes P2P and promotes decentralization.
CSW was the one who had wanted the middleman-less payment solution for his online casino stuff but failed to figure it out. He was the one who wanted a paper of it. (Remember he has applied for many patents. This is consistent. Public. Fame. He only went private because PW urged so.) He looked for help from DK. He didn't like the idea of using P2P network when it was proposed, didn't and still don't get the purpose of P2P. (This is why he keeps saying Bitcoin is not against centralized powers.) Bonus point: why was the P2P market part of early Bitcoin version canceled? Because CSW was the one who wanted it and he was coding it, but he was incompetent to finish it. (PW was busy coding real stuff.)
DK was the one who helped CSW find PW. DK was the one who created the genesis address (most likely because CSW was incompetent in cryptography). This is why CSW doesn't have the key.
PW had full understanding of how Bitcoin worked. CSW had a general idea - good enough for him to discuss with people. CSW read and had certain level of understanding of the code created by PW. Both PW and CSW had been in communication with people. On bitcointalk and via emails. CSW used the email address with gmx.com domain, which was on the official white paper. (This is why a few people ~~believe~~*feel* CSW was the Satoshi they communicated with in the early days of Bitcoin.) PW might (or might not) have used the one with vistamail.com domain, which was on the draft.
In a way, CSW was the buyer and supporter (a lousy supporter according to PW), DK was the project manager, and PW was the contractor.
They together was Satoshi. But if we are to say any single person was Satoshi, it has to be the one who invented Bitcoin, namely, came up with the (full/main) solution, even if it's theoretical. Coding or even writing the white paper doesn't count if it's done by different people. Neither CSW nor DK qualifies.
Of course there is lots of speculations. The main sources include PW's [Bitcoin Origin]( [an interview of his]( the community's works on debunking CSW's forged proofs, and the testimonials of the supporters of CSW being Satoshi. Again, there is no provable evidence. Just for fun.
Let's stop saying someone (single person) *is Satoshi*. It's most likely a team therefore it'd be wrong to say so. Saying someone (single person) *invented Bitcoin or is the inventor of Bitcoin* is more likely to be appropriate, but even that can be wrong if more than one persons together came up with the full/main solution. In the meanwhile, signing with the genesis address' key cannot prove one (alone) is Satoshi or the inventor of Bitcoin.
Edited for clarification.

When you buy something, you buy it for a reason - you think the thing you buy is worth the money. The thing you buy has the value equal to (or higher than) the money you spend. There is no loss whatsoever.
Even if you sell the thing later with a lower price, the selling *itself* doesn't incur a loss, either, because you think the money you get from selling is worth the thing *at that moment*.
It's only when you combine the buying and selling and compare it to holding the money all the way that there is a decrease of overall money you have, hence the perception of a loss. If you don't sell, the overall loss doesn't exist.

Firstly, you pay fees to get your transactions accepted into the mempool by miners. If you don't pay fees, your transactions don't even get accepted.
Secondly, you pay higher fees so that you transactions gets included in blocks more quickly when there is competition. You don't have to pay higher fees when there is no competition.
(So your statement that you pay fees to get your transaction done quickly is not entirely correct.)
Thirdly, why would miners do their job in the first place? It's because they earn profits. It's the sole incentive of proof-of-work. If miners don't profit, PoW won't work therefore Bitcoin won't work.
(So, although you don't pay fees in order for miners to profit, you effectively pay fees to make them profit in order to make your transactions work.)
Since miners must profit, when block rewards fall, transaction fees will rise. There is another factor, namely BTC's fiat price, at play. If the price rise high enough, transaction fees don't have to. But there is no guarantee that BTC's fiat price increase will always be sufficient for miners to profit. In addition, if/when Bitcoin becomes the predominant currency, people will not care about its fiat price. In that case, transaction fees have to rise.

I just found out that high orphan rate practically raises the difficulty.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
Let's say the difficulty is 1 in 1000. The probability of attempts being successful is 0.1%. In average 1000 attempts will yield one reward. With high orphan rate, 1000 attempts won't. If 2000 attempts yield one reward, of which two successful PoWs are produced while one is orphaned, the probability becomes 0.05%, which is equivalent to the difficulty of 0.5 in 1000. As a result it practically raises the difficulty.

The brief history of rBTC
At the beginning, there was only rBitcoin sub and rBTC was not cryptocurrency-related. At some stage, some people, in the name of scaling, began a coordinated propaganda of promoting a blocksize increase hardfork and bashing a softfork solution named SegWit, which had been implemented in the protocol but was not yet activated, in rBitcoin. These people mainly fell into two groups, one being shills of Bitmain, the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world, the other being altcoiners, mainly Ethereum stakeholders. The first group promoted the blocksize increase hardfork instead of the activation of SegWit because SegWit unintendedly disabled Bitmain's secret cheat in mining (Covert AsicBoost), which helped make them the number one in the market. The second group wanted Ethereum to dethrone Bitcoin. There might be other Bitcoin haters, such as bankers and remittance companies, but their identities are hard to confirm. The second group and the rest promoted the blocksize increase hardfork because 1) SegWit fixed some fundamental development-stalling bugs in Bitcoin and freed Bitcoin to the extent that it might render their coins worthless; 2) hardforks were inherently risky even when not under attack, could be easily attacked, could easily result in chain splits, which would devastatingly damage Bitcoin's value and people's belief in it; 3) hardfork blocksize increases could easily lead to centralization, which would destroy Bitcoin. They together disguised themselves as "Bitcoiners with different opinions".
For a period of time, these people spammed rBitcoin with lies and misinformation, oftentimes in an aggressive way. The mods did their job and stopped them. When their operations got hard, their leader, Roger Ver, who was an early Bitcoin adopter but believed to have become a secret Ethereum stakeholder therefore a Bitcoin hater later, somehow gained the ownership of rBTC. His paid employees became mods of it. They marketed rBTC as a Bitcoin sub with free speech. They claimed rBitcoin was censored and theirs wasn't. They mainly censored the sub by hiding the posts/comments they didn't like with massive downvoting (a feature of Reddit), which would result in negative karma of the posters/commenters, which would subsequently enable a 1 post per 10 minutes limitation (another feature of Reddit), effectively stopping them from freely expressing themselves. They claimed they wouldn't/didn't remove posts/comments and they wouldn't/didn't ban "Bitcoiners with different opinions". The truth is, they did both. A lot. With these configurations, rBTC became the nest of them all.
Before Bcash fork, what rBTC sub did was pretending to talk about Bitcoin while spreading lies and misinformation, such that hardforks were safe/good, hardfork blocksize increases were safe/good, softforks were bad, SegWit was evil, Bitcoin development was controlled by Blockstream, only Blockstream wanted SegWit, Blockstream was controlled by bankers, rBitcoin was censored, and things like that.
Then an epic battle in the community happened. Users pushed SegWit to be activated via User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF). Bitmain created Bcash, which was basically Bitcoin with SegWit removed, to preserve their mining privilege. SegWit was activated. Bcash forked away at the same time. Bitmain moved non-trivial proportion of their resources to Bcash. But the company saw Bcash as not Bitcoin. With SegWit activated and Bitmain moving on, altcoiners and other haters lost their directions for a while. They eventually came up with a new plan, which was to sell Bcash as Bitcoin (both figuratively and literally) and the idea that there could be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols.
It's worth noting that there aren't many actual Bcash supporters in rBTC. They pretend to support it in order to undetermine Bitcoin.
Fun facts: Vitalik Buterin (founder and spearhead of Ethereum) is popular in rBTC. Jorge Stolfi (\u\jstolfi), a well-known Bitcoin hater who publicly filed reports to authority claiming Bitcoin a scam, is popular in rBTC.
Bonus facts: Besides rBTC, Roger Ver owns Bitcoin(dot)com website and is believed to own  Twitter handle. Bitcoin(dot)com sells Bcash as Bitcoin by making their wallet app create Bcash wallet by default and with no clear indication.  actively bashes Bitcoin, pushes Bcash, and blocks people (so that its followers cannot see its lies getting refuted). All of the three major Bitcoin resources are either known or believed to be purchased from other people. Purchasing subreddit is in violation of Reddit's Terms of Service.
TLDR: rBTC was operated by a Bitcoin hater (an altcoiner); was filled with Bitcoin cheaters (miner's shills) and Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on); is filled with Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on). It is not a Bitcoin sub. It's an anti-Bitcoin sub.
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:53:11
Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin.
What was Bcash when it was created?
In a nutshell,
1. Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.
2. This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced more miners than every other competitor and potential all of them combined in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?
Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may including bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and  Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.
There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC and BcashSV. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.
Edit: Thanks for the silver, kind Bitcoiner!

The white paper doesn't define anything related to hard forks. It's not something that the white paper can govern.
Hard forks change the agreements amongst all current users. No one can force a change to other people in the same agreement.

There is no reason to believe his math is anything fancy. Probably just some kind of extrapolation.
He probably went all in in Bitcoin. He needed Bitcoin to really pump. He knew that prices are to a great extent self-fulfilling prophecies - if lots of people believe the price will rise, their brief will make it rise. He wanted his followers to really believe it would reach $1m, and he wanted as many believers as possible. Hence the "math", the (pretended) confidence, the bet, and so on.

Every coin exists on every fork that happens after its generation.
If your coins are in an exchange, you don't actual have the coins. What you have is an IOU (I Owe You). When a fork happens, the exchange will have the coins on both forks. But whether they will honor you both versions of coins is up to them. That's why leaving coins in exchanges is not a good idea, especially when there are risks of forking.

I have always been wondering the constituent of rbtc. Apparently there are shills of the malicious miners, malicious altcoiners, and potentially other Bitcoin haters, such as banksters and their shills.
If rbtc is against SegWit2x, I think we can draw a conclusion that the main component in rbtc is not the shills of the malicious miners. So it mainly consists of altcoiners. Take it a step further, Roger is a malicious altcoiner, which we already suspect. Take it a step further more, Roger works *with* Jihan rather than *for* him.

If you are talking about BIP148 chain, it will likely have less hashrate than the legacy chain at the beginning. Whether the situation will change is unknown. It depends on the support it gets.
UASF and BIP148 are not only discussed on Reddit.
Users, businesses, miners and so on supporting BIP148 will run BIP148 nodes. Whether it's the majority is not important because it's these people's decision. BIP148 has the characteristic that the more support it has, the more support it will get, therefore the more likely it will succeed.

It's good if this work out. But make sure that
1. You completely ignore the 2x (blocksize increase hard-fork) part.
2. You run code created by Core only.
3. You don't start to trust code created by other party without a lot of tests on the coder - to make sure they work towards Bitcoin's decentralization purpose.
4. You don't think miners arbitrarily decide to activate SegWit. (They activate it because they have to.)
5. You don't forget that miners are obligated to activate SegWit in the first place.
6. You keep in mind that more attacks will come. (Miners may attack again. Enemies of Bitcoin will definitely attack again. And the attacks can be of any form.)

There are coordinated attacks on Blockstream, which are originated from malicious miners and altcoiners. They both want to stall Bitcoin's development.
Their main point is that Blockstream hijack Bitcoin's development by pushing SegWit because it's their main business. It's a lie.
Just look at the following facts.
In order to activate SegWit, UASF is proposed. The first proposal is BIP148. Luke Jr, who is a Core dev and a contractor of Blockstream, stated that he was neutral to BIP148. Then the second UASF, BIP149, is proposed. Greg Maxwell, who is a Core dev and the CTO of Blockstream (so a boss of Luke), stated that he was against BIP148 and looked forward to BIP149. After that, Luke stated that he believed BIP148 is better than BIP149, though he still remained neutral about BIP148. At some point, Luke started to support BIP148 because, as he said, it had passed the point of no return. Ever since then, Luke has been pushing BIP148 actively, while Greg has been criticizing BIP148 firmly. Then Samson Mow joined Blockstream as CSO. He is pushing BIP148.
The question is: how can Blockstream do their business like this, if what they say about them is true?

SegWit is a soft fork with many improvements. It's wanted by the majority of the community. It uses Miner Activated Soft Fork (MASF), which requires the majority of miners signaling. Some miners have been blocking SegWit because their secret privilege (Convert ASICBOOST) will be invalidated by SegWit. They tried to stop SegWit with all sorts of dirty means. Many users are pissed off and decided to activate SegWit with User Activated Soft Fork (UASF).
Check the following links for details about SegWit and UASF:
Note that there are many UASFs. The most discussed one at this stage is BIP148. It will start to enforce the activation of SegWit on August 1.

Question 2:
Is there any difference between the coins in change addresses and the coins in external addresses when it comes to spending? Is one of them gets prioritized or are both treated equally?

The post is about when SegWit is not activated. I don't believe in SegWit2x and I don't count on it. And I don't suggest any UASFers believe in or count on it, either.
If SegWit is activated, BIP148 succeeds. As it's said, BIP148 will succeed no matter what. SegWit being activated before it becomes effective is the biggest form.

I'm not talking about BIP148. Jihan is against SegWit before BIP148.
And why is it impossible to mine non-SegWit blocks on BIP148 chain? Starting from August 1, he can signal SegWit while mining non-SegWit blocks. He actually has no choice but to mine non-SegWit blocks because SegWit hasn't been activated yet. After SegWit is activated, he can still mine non-SegWit blocks, assuming it's doable. BIP148 is about invalidating blocks not *signaling* SegWit.

Blockstream is founded by some of the Core devs. It's used by rbtc to attack Core and Bitcoin.
The claim is that Blockstream tries to control / has been controlling Bitcoin's development in order to push their agenda because their main business is based on SegWit.
The problem with that claim is that there is internal inconsistency in Blockstream on how to activate SegWit. Greg is against BIP148 and for BIP149. Luke and Samson are actively supporting and pushing BIP148. I don't understand why Blockstream would do their business like this if the claim were true.

And it's the whole point I'm making in my comment.
When the centralized miner acts arbitrarily, you can't seek for consensus because it doesn't exist. You do what you want. If they change and comply, it's good, but I won't change anything I'm doing. There have been all sorts of conspiracy going on and I'm not gonna fall for it.
Chain splits may be good and even inevitable in order to preserve Bitcoin's decentralization. And that idea itself may prevent chain splits by preventing miners acting maliciously.

I don't have the answer to your question. But there are a few issues with your question.
Firstly, there will be two chain splits. The first one will happen on August 1st. The chain will split into two: the legacy chain and the BIP148 one. I don't know if there is a scheduled date (I didn't read through the UAHF shit), but when Jihan's UAHF is activated, the legacy chain will split into two: the legacy chain and the Bitmain chain.
Secondly, if you are talking about a chain that's supported by Core, there isn't one right now because Core is no united at the moment. I'm hoping it won't fall apart permanently. Bitcoin's enemies will be very happy in that case. If you are talking about the chain with the current protocol, it does exist and will exist through the splits.

Are you not reading? The whole article is about backwards compatibility. Hard-forks are not compatible. Soft-forks, including BIP148, are backwards compatible.
There are many problems with blocksize increase hard-forks, and there are no major issues but benefits with SegWit. The article doesn't address these facts but it's based on them. The article also doesn't address that miners are obligated to signal for soft-fork protocol upgrades that the community wants and that giving miners the ability to signal for readiness is a courtesy to them. There is nothing wrong with the logic and the conclusion, except that it doesn't explicitly include these facts, which have be discussed uncountable times and are crystal clear, as the base of the argument.

US definitely can. But US government work under laws therefore they may not want to do it.
China is able to produce ASIC. They are actually the biggest Bitcoin miner manufacturer. I'm not sure about GPU. But I believe they can buy sufficient number of them. China is definitely a good candidate for such an attack because the government don't work under laws.


Thanks for discussing the technology.
The problem is that, with the censorship, it is no longer decentralized, which is the key point of Bitcoin. It's also not a long-term solution because the attacker can pretend to be a good miner for a period of time, earn the trust, get enlisted, then start the attack, and they can do it over and over.

The discussion doesn't involve if Chinese government is interfering/sabotaging Bitcoin. It merely considers the scenario that the Bitcoin network is attacked. And the conclusion is that they can't.
I agree with you that Chinese government may have already been deeply involved in the attempts of controlling/diverting/sabotaging Bitcoin, and Jihan may be their pawn, although I'm not fully convinced he is.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:27:03
Disclaimer: I'm the OP.
First of all, the original conclusion is not precisely stated. So I modified it a bit. It's as follows:




Yes, Bitcoin is broken because Nakamoto Consensus is broken in that case.
The centralized miner and/or Chinese government can try to take over Bitcoin. When it happens, the miner acts arbitrarily. It will result in that Nakamoto Consensus is broken, which will very likely result in a chain split if there are decisive people protecting Bitcoin's decentralization purpose. The forked chain will have rules modified so that the centralized influence is removed.
This is what the post suggests will happen. But I'm totally open for discussion.
We are at the early stage of Bitcoin. Not all the game theories have been explored. The post itself is such an attempt. When new game theories are discovered and accepted, they will change the game. That's why I stated at the end that Nakamoto Consensus may still be working if centralized miners refrain themselves from acting arbitrarily after they understand the consequences that the post suggests, assuming the theory is correct.


I'm not sure I understand the question. My idea is that Bitcoin may fork along the course and it's OK because some forks will carry the essences of Bitcoin. I'm hoping that with the miners' understanding and acceptance of the theory (assuming it's correct), they will act rationally in order to prevent Bitcoin from forking.
Edit: wording and grammar.

Sounds familiar. I said this to the shills like you who keeps telling lies all the time.

Sounds familiar. Jihan and Roger have lots of these.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:33:46
BIP91 makes most, if not all, miners mine SegWit signaling blocks only. BIP148 invalidates only non-SegWit signaling blocks. With BIP91, most, if not all, blocks will be valid to BIP148, therefore there won't be a split. Of course, it's based on that miners don't renege.
According to Jihan's announcement, IIRC, he will only start mining BCC when there is a chain split caused by BIP148. Since BIP91 makes the split caused by BIP148 unlikely, BCC is unlikely to happen.
Edit: typo.
@_date: 2017-07-04 04:49:26
The reason for my last comment is that Luke said he wouldn't be interested at creating another coin if Bitcoin failed because it could be hijacked by miners the same way Bitcoin was.

Its decentralized property is carefully engineered to be working and is enforced by the code. Every party in Bitcoin does exactly what the code says. It's not to be balanced or changed in any way because nothing else works. You think something different may work, go create your own coin.

Here are my analysis (please correct me if I'm wrong) and my opinion:
The original chain, i.e., the chain without any rule change, no matter if it's reorged by BIP148 ~~or Bitmain-Activated-Hard-Fork (BASF)~~, is "Bitcoin".
BIP148 chain will be "Bitcoin" if it reorgs the original chain.
BIP148 chain will have a different name than "Bitcoin" if it doesn't reorgs the original chain.
~~The BASF chain will be "Bitcoin" if no effective rule change is involved and it has more hashrate than BIP148. This is to say, if the chain hard-forks to allow 2MB blocks but no blocks bigger than 1MB is mined, the original chain will be the same as its chain, therefore you can say BASF chain is "Bitcoin". If the hard-fork only includes a checkpoint, it's the same. It's assumed that BASF chain has more hashrate than BIP148 in both cases.~~
The BASF chain will have a different name than "Bitcoin" ~~if 1) it has less hashrate than BIP148; or 2) it has effective rule changes, such as blocks mined with a blocksize increase~~.
Note that reorg ~~from both sides~~ may happen many times.
With that being said, it's up to the exchanges and other economic parties to name the coins. Jihan &amp; Co will name their chain "Bitcoin" in the companies they control, and advertise their chain to be "Bitcoin" no matter what. But the customers of any company replacing the name of the original chain may sue those companies for violating their rights and causing their financial losses because the coins they buy were "Bitcoin" but not "Bitcoin" anymore.

Because they are the main reason Bitcoin is kept decentralizedly functional, which is the key value of Bitcoin, and solidly improving. All enemies of Bitcoin, e.g., governments, central banks, commercial banks, remittance companies and payment companies who understand the power of Bitcoin, plus malicious altcoiners, hate Core because of what they do.
Jihan wants Core out because they push SegWit, which invalidates his Covert AsicBoost, if he doesn't do it for Chinese government.

This is not an admission of any kind. It's to refer to the verdict of some Core devs that BIP148 has more potential of network disturbance. The post tried not to argue about the technical details by simply admitting it in order to save the arguments, which is unimportant.


You failed to understand what BIP148. It's "I don't care what Jihan and his sock puppets think, say and do. I'm doing it." It's "I'm ignoring Jihan!." In trolling, you care and you don't ignore.


You are unbelievable. Core has updated and maintained the Bitcoin software and the network, which is a cutting-edge technology, almost flawlessly for many years. Yeah, people don't know why they look up to them. /s

Making more money when getting older is probably the most solid argument for hacking monthly repayments/loans, but getting used to it and live such a lifestyle is an issue. The lifestyle is developed by bankers to enslave people.
I'm not against borrowing money, just borrowing money (and staying in debts) as if it's a part of the life. If there is a genuine urgent need, go for it. We can't stop people from living the lifestyle of being in monthly loans because it's their choice, but we can certainly work on it. And we should. Because the fewer people live the lifestyle, the less impact the banking system can cause to everyone, including those who don't live that way. (The more people live the lifestyle, the more monetary inflation is introduced, making everyone's life harder, except for the bankers.)

UASF is necessary. It's actually the reason why SegWit2x is born. Miners can play with SegWit2x just like they play with SegWit. That's why UASF is still a must.

Although some BIP148 proponents use it as a threat, I believe some support it as a "I'm doing this no matter what your choice you make". There is a fine difference. Those in the former group expect miners to respond in the way they want. Those in the latter group don't. It may be a game of chicken for the former group, but not a game for the latter. Just wanted to point that out.

ASICBOOST is listed by CVE as a vulnerability:

It won't kill Bitcoin. The worst case is a difficulty change hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:35:29
I believe it's because of either Covert ASICBOOST or something we don't know yet.
It's also possible that he's worried that mining all non-SegWit blocks in SegWit era is suspicious.
@_date: 2018-12-30 09:59:23
My speculations, as stated before, include
1. he was converted to Ethereum a long time ago; he then remained in Bitcoin in order to undermine it (because it's the best way);
2. besides the crimes he had been convicted, he committed some other crimes; the government cut a deal with him: he will not be criminally charged if he acts to undermine/destroy Bitcoin (as its "supporter").
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:31:28
No, I won't. If Jihan accepts SegWit at this stage, it's because he has no choice.
If it happens, only the current implementation of SegWit, which invalidates ASICBOOST, counts.
2MB won't go through.
@_date: 2017-06-25 03:59:56
Yes, it appears so. No one knows about the real reason with certainty. But most likely the reason is that they want to keep the privilege of ASICBOOST and the whole scaling debate is just to stop and now to stall SegWit.

If you are taking about the cases discussed in the original post, a PoW change is not needed.

I have no idea how consistent Satoshi's post times and commit times are. What I have read was that his post times were weird. Care to share some more details to support your claim on this matter?
If Satoshi's post time and commit times are consistent, it can be explained that CSW had never been able to produce any code, and subsequently didn't post on bitcointalk. But unless proofs are present, CSW could be the guy behind gmx.com email address.

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin.
What was Bcash when it was created?
In a nutshell,
1. Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.
2. This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced more miners than every other competitor and potential all of them combined in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.
By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?
Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.
It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may including bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and  Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.
There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC and BcashSV. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin. In a nutshell,
1. Bcash is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.
2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most  miners in the world.
3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.
4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.
5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.
6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.
7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.
7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.

One question: It's said the parent chain is not bloated by the auxiliary chain's data. But the Merkel root of the auxiliary chain's block is inserted into Bitcoin's coinbase transaction. A SHA256 Merle root is 32 bytes. Isn't that quite a bit of data?

It's the same for ASICBOOST. We can safely assume ASICBOOST is being used. No solid evidence is needed. It has to be blocked so that we are on the safe side.
I believe the reason Luke said the ASICBOOST-disabling soft-fork is unnecessary is there is not enough time to add it to BIP148. I personally think it should be worked on in parallel with BIP148 and activated on the legacy chain if BIP148 fails.

Thanks for the write-up.
My analog is a simplified view. It only looks at the problem as a big picture.
My understanding about fractal reserve is D = d / FFR, where d is the initial deposit and D is the maximum of total deposits after relending/redepositing. Your equation starts from the lending. I'm not sure if they express the same thing.
I don't understand the "CREATING ANOTHER $20,000" part. Do they actually do that?
My knowledge about fractal reserve does not include interbank lending. I thought it should be strictly controlled if not totally forbidden because otherwise it can create infinite money supply. Maybe I'm wrong. Any good tutorials on this matter?

If your power is threatened and you have the money to fight back, you'd do it. Not to mention that governments can print money.
The method, if working, can not only stop Bitcoin, but also any cryptocurrency based on proof-of-work, which basically kill the whole idea.

No one can stop anyone from hard-forking from Bitcoin. It's everyone's right. And it existef from day one. It has never changed. But any new coin created with a hard-fork without consensus cannot have Bitcoin's name.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:38:23


Why do we have to try to impose the soft-fork in the first place? Miners have the obligation to signal and they don't do it. The soft-fork is supposed to be activated.


Soft-forks don't require consensus. They only require majority support, which SegWit has.

Yes, it's true. But it won't happen to Bitcoin. If we do a PoW change, lots and lots of people will start to mine Bitcoin.


Nodes are the judge. They determine what blocks are valid. They are the key part of Bitcoin network. Miners merely work to satisfy them.


How do forks have anything to do with the fundamentals of Bitcoin? With all the forks, has the decentralization of Bitcoin changed?

I totally agree with the strategy. But the communication channel should be set up prior to the change. Where will it be announced? There should also be guides for the switch, on both the node side and the miner side. The algorithm can be left out in the guides. I suppose it won't be as simple as downloading and running a new client, at least not for miners. Maybe I'm wrong.

Thanks for your input.
What makes suspicious is not just about Halong.
Here is an incomplete list of his suspicious actions:
- Propagate Blockstream's hijacking of Bitcoin development (SegWit/layer-2/bank-controlled/etc)
- Defame Adam Back
- Praise Bcash development
- Defame Halong
- Advocate hard fork PoW algorithm change even after open license of AsicBoost
In his article, which you linked, he emphasized facts. What facts does he have to justify his sayings about Blockstream / Adam Back? We know there is none. He even called me a shill of Blockstream, which I know for sure he's plainly lying.
He had badmouthed Halong over and over, causing some serious damages to the company. With only one apology, he concluded all the defamation. It seems way too light/cheap to me. My take on this is that his apology is just a show in order to regain his credibility. Unless he makes up for Halong (by advertising for them, for example), it means nothing.
Roger Ver is in an important position in Bitcoin. He had done plenty of highly suspicious things to Bitcoin. He failed to demonstrate his stakes in Bitcoin, which he should, in multiple occasions, and claimed he sold out his BTC after Bcash's birth, which is not credible at all. We know he is not for Bitcoin. Cobra is in a similar situation. When he praises Bcash's development with a dubious attitude, he is as suspicious as Roger.
I have failed to see any action that he performed actually benefits Bitcoin. I have only seen his actions impair Bitcoin in various ways. Therefore I've concluded he's compromised.
whose words I take seriously, backed Cobra strongly a few times without reasoning. I'd love to read what he has to say.
Edit: changed a word.

I've seen in many occasions (articles/videos) that people think Satoshi might be a team. IIRC, even Andreas said so. I don't think it's just CSW.


In my theory, DK had never communicated externally. Only PW and CSW. You (and likely many other people) probably won't agree with me on this one, but Satoshi's famous quote "if you don't understand it or don't believe me, I don't have the time to try to convince you" sounds to me quite similar to the way CSW talks (arrogant).


Only PW coded in the early stage. CSW might or might not coded later. DK had never coded.


Interesting. What have you read, bitcointalk or the mailing list, or both?


Most people in the space are from US. Why did people say Satoshi's post times were weird?


Because the few people who met and supported CSW was Satoshi *felt* they were talking to Satoshi in the early days. This is a factor that's overlooked by many, especially cryptography-competent ones. The ways people communicate don't change. Not to mention there might be mentioning of specific details in the communications they had with "Satoshi" in the early days. You don't need your SO to sign a message to recognize him/her even if you can't see his/her face. A quick chat will suffice.


What fraud did DK commit? I don't think he even lied. He died a long time ago.
What fraud did PW commit? What benefits has he got / can he get? He is against CSW. This is not how frauds are normally carried out. It's like the allegation of Blockstream was behind SegWit. Greg and Luke had a big disagreement/fight on how it should be activated, and then Blockstream hired Samson Mow, who had the same view as Luke. Frauds don't work that way.


Bcashers can do whatever they want and Bitcoin doesn't give a shit, even if CSW were the only inventor of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is what we, the user's, define it. I don't support Bcash or CSW's support of centralized power in any way, but I accept truths, no matter how ugly they are.

The attacker can keep wiping out genuine blocks, which contains genuine use of Bitcoin/blockchain.
Here is what he'll do:
1. Secretly mine, say, 10 blocks.
2. Broadcast the blocks. This will wipe out the 9- genuine blocks.
3. Go to step 1.
In this way, people will not only lose money because of the wipeouts, but also not be able to use Bitcoin at all because it won't process any transactions.

You can just stop there.
Bitcoin is what Bitcoin is. Its decentralization property is untouchable no matter who.
Users and all other parties, except miners, have a say in added features and improvements.
Miners, as paid workers, are the only party that does not have a say in Bitcoin, no matter how much they invest in their equipment. No worker has a say in what his jobs are and how much he gets paid. Period.

SegWit is an update to Bitcoin protocol. It's done in a safe way (soft-fork). It requires support from the majority of the community, and it has it.
SegWit2x contains two parts: 1) a way to activate SegWit; 2) a way to change the blocksize limit to 2MB. The first part is a soft-fork itself (so a soft-fork to activate another soft-fork), and it's safe and welcomed. The second part has a long controversial history. It's an update to Bitcoin protocol, too. It's done in a highly risky way (hard-fork). It requires consensus (support from every and each user), but it doesn't have it. On the contrary, most non-faked knowledgeable Bitcoiners are against the idea as well as the hard-fork. There had been propaganda for SegWit+2MB. SegWit2x is basically a repack of the idea.
Bitcoin poses a threat to many powers, such as banks and governments. It has lots of enemies. They want to destroy Bitcoin. Raising the blocksize limit will cause running nodes, which are essential to Bitcoin's decentralization, more expensive in many ways. It's a way to make Bitcoin centralized so that it can be destroyed.

SegWit2x can only happen with consensus because it involves a hard-fork and hard-forks require consensus. SegWit, BIP148 and BIP149 don't require consensus because they are soft-forks.
