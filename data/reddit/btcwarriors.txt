I erased the widget from the site so i cant go back now. The widget showed Donations were made but the amount was still the same as the 1st Donation. We have a offline wallet that we use. It works fine i have made transactions and received transactions in it. Im just disappointed god knows how much those donations were for :( every bit helps

In my email yesterdsy I told you our BITSTAMP account has
been hacked and 1.8 BTC has been stolen.
This money belonged to  SBIF, the SurfScientist Bitcoin Investment Fund.
We have another fund, held at Coinbase, that contains the money
for the Shared profit Plan (the weekly payouts). These funds are
unaffected and the Shared Profit Plan operates as before.
It's a bad enough thing to lose one's own money, but is far more terrible
to lose funds trusted to you by someone else. I will not expose myself
to such experience again. Therefore, the Investment Fund will be re-openend
but with some important changes :
1) it is not possible to directly deposit BTC into the Fund anymore. The only
   way to put funds in there is by setting the 'PayoutToFund" flag in your
   memberprofile to "Yes". This will deposit your weekly payouts from the
   Shared profit Plan into the fund.
2) you will still earn 0.25% daily over your SBIF balance.
3) You can withdraw your SBIF balance when it reaches the 0.001 btc minimum payout level.
4) When you SBIF Balance grows to &gt; 0.01 BTC it will be automatically paid out.
These  rules ensure the fund will not grow to a size I cannot recover in
case of disaster.
There's been a big explosion in the lab - but we're still alive and kicking!

We are now using coinbase for Donations our Bitpay Donation Button could only accept 0.1 BTC daily. We were receiving Donations higher than 0.1 thank you for all the support. Look forward to making this Project a reality and spreading BTC knowledge to youth and helping them build a better future.
