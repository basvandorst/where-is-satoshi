Except bitcoin isn't only for investing. It's currency. People buy it to use and that's how it got big. People will buy at whatever price if they don't care about investing cause they're immediately gonna send it to someone else and it won't cost them more or less.

Good job being unspecific so no one can actually interpret what you're talking about. The government being involved in drugs? As in trafficking, lacing, keeping them illegal, propaganda? The government is involved in drugs in many ways and unless all drugs were decriminalised that wouldn't change.
In no way did I say or even imply that the banking system was good. You're just making random assumptions or talking out of your ass. Cryptocurrencies are only relevant to what were talking about because they are used in dnms. No where did I say they're bad and we should stick to regular banks.
No-one ego stroking.

So they give you a full explanation of why the previous comment was wrong and you're response is basically just saying their dumb.. Good job. If you can't understand why the darknet is a helpful thing but also an incredibly dangerous horrible thing then you really need to educate yourself.

It's a world currency but it's pretty obvious what he meant. He meant a popular world currency. And when half the people who use Bitcoin only buy and sell it to make money and the other half only use it to buy illegal things it's never going to get more popular.

Of course.. If I have a million pounds and then spend it all on a house then I don't have a million pounds, I have a house. Ergo I'm not a millionaire.

That's ridiculous. On so many levels. 
When you talk about the development of technology from horses to cars it doesn't apply to Bitcoin becoming a world currency because Bitcoin is already a thing and would have to grow in popularity, not be innovated upon.
Also this thread is saying buy a Bitcoin or some Bitcoin and keep it cause that could make you a millionaire some day. And that could be true for some people but if no-one ever sold Bitcoin then it would never grow in popularity. THE ONLY WAY BITCOIN WILL GROW IS BY USING IT AS CURRENCY. How do so many people not understand that?

So you're not a millionaire... Assets aren't money. 
That's like saying "Exactly! I'm a millionaire because I'm really young and have lots of time left to work a job to get to a million." They both have something valuable, just not  the thing that makes you a millionaire.

Taken entirely out of context..
