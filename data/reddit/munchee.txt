If you read their white paper, they didn't plan to make biometric be the end all be all of authentication. It's part of the multifactorial scheme, including pairing with the phone. So, having the phone + having the wrist band + having the right ECG would authorize the device.
Assuming your ECG is compromised, you still need to have the other devices to access the embedded data.
Biometrics can still be used as part of the scheme "something you are, know and have".

That's exciting. When the service is more complete may I suggest you to introduce the team as well? I understand that the service is still in its testing phase and not ready yet. As of now, I see many reddit accounts claimed that they are involved in the project. Would be easier if we know who's behind this project. Thank you. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 13:46:12
By that reasoning:
The current 48Kb block size would include a little less than 200 transactions. The current reward is 25BTC. Say you want to motivate the pool operators to increase the block size, the total fee has to give them a sizable return, say around 1% of the whole block reward -- 0.25BTC. Divide that to roughly 200 txns currently in their blocks, you'd get a 0.00125BTC, which is about a dollar each transaction.
So, if we all pay around 1mBTC per transaction, discus fish will consider increasing their block size to exchange for the risk of not relaying the block fast enough.
Open market will only work if you have a good system. Else everything will just grind to a halt.
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:48:36
Pacemaker should be alright. Atrial fibrillation is tough though. Or any heart condition that makes the ECG not reproducible for that matter. But this is a very cool idea regardless.
Actually, their white paper identified these issues already


Although, there seems to be a backdoor still, in case of heart attack


Interesting. White paper is here.

@_date: 2014-02-05 13:34:08
Thanks for the well thought out answer.


At it stands right now, the fee make up less than 1% of the block reward (it's more like 0.01%). I doubt they will have much motivation to include more transactions.
All of your questions about the block size are valid. Peter Todd's recent interview with Let's talk Bitcoin mentioned this as the problem. But it's the problem we will have to deal with in a year time. The new floating fee will be implemented soon (already in the pipeline). Most bitcoiners are hoping to have it ease up the current high fee. However, I'm afraid it won't deliver that promise, at least not until the transaction fees make up a larger portion of the block reward.
@_date: 2014-03-15 03:02:21
That's good to know. No other way to take the fund without the mnemonics. Thanks.

Maybe you can ask Coinbase to manually associate that address to Wikipedia account or something. In another word, have the fund sent to that address credited into Wikipedia account. I'm sure they can work something out. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 13:05:27
Unfortunately with the current situation, "normal" users who use standard bitcoin wallets will risk their funds locked up until the pending transaction is cleared, making them more likely to set the fee higher or go with the suggested floating value.

The difference is that the investor would know how many percent of the company a share worth, so they can make an informed decision. Let the market determine the fair value of the company.

Exactly. Hence it should not be used for evaluation. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 12:41:46
Crowdsale should not be used as a marker for evaluation.   The first thousand who bought in had a very different value in mind, comparing to the last thousand.
@_date: 2016-05-04 15:31:16
Also. I love the wallet and everything mycelium have done so far.
That being said, I think crowdsale like this is misleading. If you were to sell shares for 5% of the company, the raised fund will be much much different.
Instead, crowdsale this way makes sure your company will benefit greatly from the hype, cut away all the middle man. 
Just curious, can participants withdraw their buy-in?

I think that's ok, as long as you pass your change to another paper wallet after use. Or better yet, like someone suggested in another thread, store them in small denominations and spread it out on your paper wallet. Whenever you use it, discard the paper wallet and move the remaining change to another paper wallet. 
So you would have a bunch addresses with 1btc value, and with 5btc value. Just use the live Cd to generate the addresses. And import the private keys onto Blockchain to use them, then move remainder to another paper wallet after you spend them.

I don't think you understand my post. The distribution model for bitcoin is to mine and strengthen the network, or to exchange for miner's work. 
But ripple model is to have trust in the founders to distribute things fairly. 
As in the initial start. There will always be complains. Would you have 1 person mining first or 10 person mining first? How do the creator make everyone interested all from the start if he doesn't have a working prototype? You are the unreasonable one here buddy. Why don't you give a scenario that would satisfy your doubt? I can surely point out some other criticism. 
Edit: haven't finished addressing all the points. How do you know he is so sure the system will succeed? It's 20/20 hindsight. It could have been a complete flop. If so he would have had 1mil of his own coins for fun.

I have as much faith in bitcoin as the next guy. I know it wouldn't matter at all. But it makes things MUCH MUCH harder for countries where bitcoin is not well known (like Vietnam). Vietnam has this age old problem of overreaching government. One cannot transmit more than 10,000 USD outside of the country, no forex allowed (similar to China). Without exchanges and people mistrust in virtual currencies, it would make the adoption a long hard road. Without trust, no business would accept bitcoin as settlement method for fear of government crackdown. Then bitcoin will forever be at the fringe, being used by the people don't have alternatives ie. illegal activities. It's a downward spiral.

However, I think these usb need to be able to communicate via wifi, to be able to mine on its own without connecting to a computer.
Thanks for the review. I've never mined before but I might get started if these USB are cheap enough.

@_date: 2013-03-31 00:03:30
First of all, I apologize for going off on a tangent here.
I thought the more celebrated strength of bitcoin is its near anonymity. If "most" people use banking system to manage the coins. Would the government use that as an excuse to make any activity outside of the banking system illegal? In a way, they can mark the coins within the circulation (tainted by the banks, which can be traced). And any other coins that are outside of that loop is considered illegal. They can monitor the network constantly and can catch those people -- the tax invader or the outlaws.
I think this is one of the reason why the US want to regulate the mining business. And make those coins registered for taxing purposes. But eventually, they want to be able to contain the good economy in control. And this digital currency provide them a fantastic tool to track for illegal activity (coins that wasn't registered through the government).
Am I being too paranoid?
@_date: 2013-04-28 15:51:15
I did. It's legit. Had a large transaction a while back.

I'm reading this article. This guy is a total recluse. Very possible that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.
However, in his [blog]( he has been working on the series of 4 part paper during the Bitcoin development. I don't know if he worked on these two in concurrent. It's unlikely but not impossible.

If so, when do you have to worry about this? I mean, it's ideally that we have these set up. But in the real world, not a lot of people are thinking about these things very early. But accidents happen. In the current system, someone can step in and say we have reasonable evidence that this wealth should be made available to the children after the accident. There is no such thing in bitcoin. It means, the learning curve is huge. The user has to be a reasonably tech savvy individual. I've watch a presentation saying that such form of social contract is built into the system, but they haven't activated it yet. I'm not so clear on that.

Electrum or armory is the same idea I suppose. You skipped over the steps where you need to set up an offline computer. And how would you spend your coins? Still need to sign it somehow, without connecting the offline computer to the Internet to get unspent output

Did you read the post? It outlined the exact process. No need to download Blockchain either. I use armory offline. The bulk of it is to set up a Linux on a stick to carry with you rather than having another laptop. 
I guess I can still use Electrum instead of armory. Same idea :) 
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:01:59
then where did you spend your 0.01 coin? Using bitcoin-qt I bet. One way your bitcoin-qt doesn't see the change is when you use Blockchain's custom send option, and you selected the new address for change option.
Take some time to understand the idea of addresses, keys and wallets. It makes a lot of sense after you do though.

Did you have two step verification turned on? 
@_date: 2013-05-25 09:04:11
1) make sense.
2) The way I think about it is that each deterministic wallet is a line on a plane. Say we have a space of 2^256 single points, and we have 2^256 ways of drawing lines (different deterministic wallet seed space = address space). There bound to have intersections between lines. I don't know if it will happen on the 2nd address, or on the 2^12 address in one chain, but it's totally possible right? I guess the probability is extremely low, but it's higher than a random address. How much higher, that's what I want to know.
3) This question is essentially, from a list of public addresses, can anyone conclude if they were generated by a deterministic wallet or by random generation? I guess I need to find the documentation of deterministic wallet and how they were generated.

The example is just an exaggeration. But the first non developer user could have made the same argument. 
He published the white paper in 2008. The miner was published 2009, a few days after he mined the first block. 
Edit: there maybe a reason for the delayed release, as you would want people to mine on the same chain rather than having a bunch of chains starting. Since he's mining alone, those 6-7 days may give him some initial blocks to start the chain.

I too don't think the credit card company will eat that fee. They put the burden onto the sellers to validate the IDs of the user.
However, I can see a bank of some sort pop-up and take away the risk. They will just operate on bitcoin the same way they do on USD. You deposit your small amount to a debit card, they would validate that you have that amount of coins in that card to be spent. And will settle with the merchant for a fee.
Also, you can still pay by checks at the groceries stores, can't you? That takes a week to confirm.

I totally agree that bitcoin is not AI. But it has a feedback mechanism by adjusting the difficulty of the hash according to the power of the network. That's the same concept as any biological system - feedback and control. It is part of the necessary grand picture for an interconnected net.

I don't think you know what premined coins means.
@_date: 2013-06-11 09:06:01
I doubt it will be reverted. I believe this is a bug in Blockchain.info. It doesn't check the validity of the input coins prior to sending. Since the second transaction has valid fee and likely to be confirmed (assuming the input is valid), it'll be kept around. The first transaction however is kept in the pool because of the second transaction. Without the second transaction, it'll be disappeared after a week or so. However I've tried to wait for weeks before. It never went away due to the same problem. Blockchain.info will keep pushing these transactions out to its peers (almost a thousand peers). 
These are my analysis, I don't understand the inner working of things very well and don't know how to raise this issue. I tried before when it happened to me, but it got deleted somehow. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:57:11

to have a transaction, you need to feed the unspent output to the offline machine. Ubuntu Live USB offline is your best bet. Copy the unspent output (from blockchain.info) and feed it to the a transaction calculator to sign it. Then use  to broadcast the Signed Transaction
Example: copy this output  to  on your offline wallet, then copy the private key over it. There should be a relatively easy way to write a script to fetch unspent output for all your offline wallet, and you can carry the file over to the offline computer, and run a script to generate a transaction of a set value, and return the signed tx for pushing when plugged to the online computer. I don't have time to write some basic bash script, but supposed should be very simple.

While that's true in a functional government, it doesn't apply for a non functional one like all the third world countries. It relies on trust and I believe bank trust is at all time low.

Which is your main wallet? Bitcoin-qt may have generated a new address (yours) stored in the bitcoin-qt wallet that blockchain.info doesn't see. After every transaction,  bitcoin-qt pass the remaining fund to a new address and have its private keys there as well. That's why you need to back up your wallet after every transaction if you use that option, because the list of addresses that you own keep increasing. It gives great privacy (they don't know who is who), but can be confusing from times.
Another option is Armory. This app generates addresses/key pair in a deterministic way, meaning you can save one "seed" that can grow in to your entire list of addresss everytime. No need to have continuous backup.
Blockchain.info does this whenever you pass the change to a new address if you use it's backup options to dropbox or google drive. They are of course encrypted with your password. Quite safe.

I think the new ASIC wave will lead to a much lower entry cost for people to start mining. I want to mine but I don't want to throw in $1k of investment and burn my house down with the GPU running all the time. I want something small, consume less energy and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

I think that the gullibles are gullible.
This is crowd sourcing in a nutshell.
There's a theory that the collective mind is smarter than any all the single minds combined. There's a feedback effect. This is why an ant colony is much much smarter than any single ant in the colony. As a colony, it can withstand rough weather, find good source of food, and expand its territory. As a single ant, it doesn't know left from right. Purely driven by instinct. This is why people study physics don't have to worry about how each single molecule behave, and microbiologists don't have to worry about how each cell behave, but would look at the colonies.
Same idea can be used to explain the market. It comprises of millions of people who has different wants and needs. But as a market, it will behave in a predictable way, if no outside force manipulate it. I think bitcoin will be the first one ever exist in this realm.
This is why I believe bitcoin (or its idea) will live on.

@_date: 2013-05-13 06:19:37
I think whatever cryptocurrency that want to rise up will have to face with those resistance (DDOS, regulation, hacking attempts). So if Bitcoin succeeds and be the first, it will be de factor cryptocurrency until another drastically improved version appears. So far there is no sign indicating it will not.
Of course if another currency comes out with significant improvements, I don't think it would be compatible with the current system of Bitcoin. If it is, why not fix the bitcoin protocol to adapt the changes?
So, until bitcoin falls, if ever, no one knows if we need another cryptocurrency. Right now, litecoins and other coins are relatively stable because of their obscurity, not security.

Yes we should give him his privacy. But if you read the article, he did stir up the entire mathematics community via his recent publication. I'm sure he's no stranger to being disturbed by the world trying to peer into his mind.
In any case, after reconsideration, Mochizuki seems to be very divorced form the real world (due to his theoretical work). He maybe one of the Satoshi Nakamotos, but I don't think he is THE one. Bitcoin is intricate in weaving economics and the right incentive for different participants in the economy. Very pragmatic. Somehow I don't see it in Mochizuki.

OK, I'll bite. I take these ideas from an [old Radiolab episode](
Example 1: Think of it this way. An ant colony. Each single ants is behaving in with its own purpose. The idea of the ant colony is so far removed from the life it an ant. A scientist who tries to study ant colonies from a single ant is missing out a big part of the network effect. Each ant communicate via some sort of pheromones. As a whole, pattern emerges. Whenever you have a large network of equivalent nodes, differentiation will happen for each ant to specialize in a certain role.
Example 2: Neurons in your brain. Each neuron does similar thing, fire and silent, imposing positive and negative effects on other neurons, making it a neural network. Together they make sure your body have enough breathing drive, regulate your temperature, etc... When you look at one single cell in the brain, you'd never understand how consciousness and complicated thoughts can form out of that. It almost seems unreal to think those thoughts, doubting your own mind. However, remember the ant example. Same idea. As a colony, it moves, expands, find food, pass on messages, without any central control. This is similar, the brain is similar. Pattern emerges from chaos. Your mind emerges from your past experience (stored in hippocampus) and your emotions (amygdala).
Example 3: The internet. Here we are, the internet. Each computer, each user is a single node of the network, with their wants and needs, their motives and good wills. But as a whole, they becomes something else. And with a bitcoin network, it's similar. Each node on the bitcoin network is an ant in example 1, a neuron in example 3. It is very tempting to consider bitcoin, internet, global consciousness an inevitable, not a rarity. This is where you see biology system in economic world. It's is very exciting indeed.

mostly from random treasure hunting game that keep showing up. Before the solution is shown, everyone will try to import it to their wallet, and when they're not the winner, they forget to delete the address from their wallet. Then anyone can collect these solution and make a script to scan those known addresses, waiting for someone somewhere uses that address in their wallet by accident, then the script would empty the address in seconds.

I suppose the need is different for everyone. In countries in Asia, government exerts a ridiculous force on individual wealth and the amount of money that can flow outside of the country. Also, these countries are affected by horrible inflation caused by their monetary policy. Same thing happens in Latin America. Bitcoin solves this beautifully. Having an assess that is untouched by government is a great thing. And if it's reaping the benefit of deflation, it'd be great as well. But that's hoarding.
My guess is that the use of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin will also be very popular among the expats and people who have the needs to cross borders all the time, for work or for leisure.
The other upside of such currency/assess is that it can be used for transaction worldwide. Countries like Nigeria, Vietnam, etc.. once plagued with fraudulent credit cards that none of the shops want to do business with them. There are a huge growing demands in the middle glass of these countries to participate in the ecommerce. Bitcoin fits the bill perfectly.
Of course, bitcoin is the first of its kind. It can become extremely successful, or it can flop. But I'm certain that others like it will rise. The world needs cryptocurrency. So while the people in the US might not need it, since they have a strong USD. The rest of the world (read: the commoners) whose currencies are pegged to the dollars would appreciate it. You may not see the need for it, but I see a huge potential in the protocol. People will complain about the early adopters and their large holdings when the system is successful. But the same people flees at the first sight of fluctuation.
I believe in the idea, that's why I'm participating in the experiment, hoping for its success. Fluctuation is scary, because no one knows if its the sign of healthy growth, or the sign of failure. I personally think that bitcoin has reached its critical mass. People are finding about it, for every 9 people who flocks to it for quick profit, there will be 1 that see its potential. And that's enough :)

So I think the perpetrator got access to your wallet, created a new address 1KYQcnx9ANXxikf479XPTzc6k7LtMwpXbt, then send the 17btc you have to 155xm8Gg9YXMQJeYB7LMNZVNGabNDXFacB, essentially empty your wallet out, and transfer the leftover balance to that account (1KYQcnx9ANXxikf479XPTzc6k7LtMwpXbt). You may or may not have the private key to this address, I haven't used strongcoins yet.
I'm still new but that's what I gather. Either that or he imported your wallet to a client and made that transaction.

I just checked my phone. The password is stored in plain text in /data/data/piuk.blockchain.android/shared_prefs/piuk.blockchain.android_preferences.xml
Obviously the rouge app needs root permission to access your root folders. But ya, it's scary. Especially if you give root to apps that you don't know their exact function.
One more think that I need to remind you guys is that if the app has root access, it can lift your Google authenticator and install it to another android phone with all of its secret keys. So, be careful if you have a root android phone. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:44:42
sorry dude. If you encrypted your wallet, why didn't you throw it on the cloud, in your emails, in google drive for back up?
Did you have a mac with dropbox on it by any chance? If you do, you *might* be able to ssh into the machine and move the wallet to dropbox (I've never tried this before, and if you must have it activated, it's not default).
Other than that, I don't know how else you can retrieve it.

You're right. This is a very interesting view. But these countries needs a way to convert bitcoin back to fiat. Some exchanges in Vietnam have been playing that role up to now. But with the fall of LR, they also take a fall and cause government to be extra vigilant against online exchange.

two things:
1. If you look at the last time it crosses, around 60-65 on this chart:  (sorry I'm too lazy to draw). It had a tremendous run to 260 before taking a dive. I don't know how long you'd like to short your coins for, but it can be a long time before it take a dive. You could hold on to it and enjoy the ride, or back out and wait a month for it to drop to gain 20%. Again, my opinion as well.
2. You're using one address for a lot of thing. I'd recommend you create as many address as you want. And use them for different purposes. Your wallet should be backed up every time you make a new address.

@_date: 2013-05-11 20:27:52
Easy. You have two options:
1. If you want to keep you offline wallet, then you need to sign a transaction to transfer the fund in the armory wallet to a wallet that you have access to without the whole blockchain (Electrum or Blockchain.info). Follow my guide here  but start from step 6 and don't boot into the live CD, your armory client without the full blockchain is acting as an offline client.
2. Migrate your entire coins to another online/thin-client wallet, then go to  and paste your paper wallet backup there. Then, import the private key of the address with balance to your client (blockchain.info or electrum). Make sure you transfer the balance to a new address not on your armory wallet.

This, and a presigned transaction to your checking or online wallet handy. You can always push the transaction without decrypting your wallet. Brainwallet.org and Blockchain.info/pushtx are great for this purpose. 
If you want to be extra crazy, have the TX set up as followed, to your online wallet and the remaining fund to another offline address. That way, no public key of your saving account will ever be exposed. A bit crazy but it's easy enough.

Thank you for the thoughtful response.
I agree bitcoin still needs to be dumbed down a lot for the common people to meaningfully use it.
What I'm worry more about is the idea of a single global currency. The two best things about America domination of the world are its USD and its military power. One is protecting the other in lock step. Smaller countries who don't have much to offer the world have to rely on USD as a backing system - a global currency in a sense - to do trade with other countries (see last week NPR planet money [episode]( about the Kenya money problem.
And here comes a global currency. The design is almost perfect to break down the state barrier. If it dethrones the USD in global market, I doubt that the US government will let it live that easily.
One of a few things they can do is to regulate it. Make sure that the coins which are mined in the US stays in the US circulation. And make a law saying that if you have foreign trades, you have to register with the government/agency. This essentially fragments the bitcoin blockchain. Since every coin is traceable, and if they are all registered when mintly mined, they are part of US wealth. All legal activities has to go through a bank/agency, and making it illegal to trade outside of that space. Orphaned coins (coins which were mined without registration to any of the country/state) will be viewed as black market territory. And there will be minimal mixing between the two pools.
I've been thinking a lot about Bitcoin lately and am very fascinated by the idea. It's a powerful idea. And the resistance will be spectacular in the next 20 years.

It will never go through since the fee is too low for this one (the input of the transaction in question)
If you have control over the sender addresses in the above tx, do consider attempt a double spend using bitcoin-qt. Similar situation happened to me. I had to import those coins and attempt to send them with higher fee (a small unconfirmed tx tied up a bigger fund)
side question, are you using blockchain wallet by any chance? The last time it also attempt to spend unconfirmed input from my wallet.
edit: A better way is to try to import your key of 1ChvovQoDmiojK75rg4pVe3USnuDL4yQei (assuming you're on the sending end, not the receiving end) and spend the 0.8 btc fund in bitcoin-qt. Blockchain.info will not show you this balance due to the tie up tx, blockexplorer does

You'd like to become a full node first (running bitcoin qt). Then import the address you want to double spend, send the coins to some other address using a generous fee. Then you wait for the miner to include that in and the transaction in the pool is invalidated.

Wow that sounds excessive. It's been 3h and the transaction is still not confirmed. Does it mean the fund is frozen until it's confirmed? This sounds like a major problem isn't it? Esp with normal payment. 1 BTC shouldn't cost 0.5% fee if I just transfer it between wallets.

You can compare it to whatever you like. But in the early growing phase, swings are to be expected. When the adoptions is wider, they'll slowly stabilize.

Then he sweep the 6btc fund (sweep = transfer the balance in a private key without importing the address). The wallet happen to sweep his 6btc to the compromised address. 
So, best way to get balance from an address is to sweep it. Don't import it.

I would take the total btc created per day divided by the total network hash rate to get an intrinsic price of a MHash. It could be very valuable to estimate if the ASIC you're buying is profitable.

Not sure you answered this, but did you check if the wallet was accessed by a different IP? Blockchain has that option.

Make a virus and spread it. This will open a whole can of worms as more hackers are drawn to this (not that they currently don't).

I think other software can help you make a transaction (.tx files) and sign it with armory (electrum?). I've never use it so I don't know. Blockchain has an option to use private key to authorize transaction of watch only wallet, I guess you can use that. Need 2 laptop though, to show the private key from armory wallet (i wouldn't print it out) to blockchain's camera.

Not really, they are all linked to this [1FGAftzSTztFSB8LMwsrdCKTyqGY6zr3sU](
edit: Digging into it some more I found out that this is the address that Avalon used to collect preorders.
Here's the path:
[Up 1 level](
[Up 2 levels](
[Up 3 levels](
[Down to 2nd level, to a different branch](
[Down to 1st level, following the larger output](
[Bingo, unspent output is right here](
I think this chain of transactions are done by a program. I don't know what are they trying to achieve.

Self fulfilling prophecy. Because there could be a price drop, so people try to sell high and buy low. But because everyone is doing this, the price drop. Hence...

I hate that app haha. I use it for cold storage. That's about it. Never start it on. Nor bitcoin-qt. I now have to turn it on whenever I want to move coins out. Since it's a pain to do that, I'm less likely to spend into my saving. Blockchain is my main spending wallet, convenient and relatively secure.

no problem. It's a good habit to have multiple encrypted copies of your valuables (photos, notes, original contents,etc...) spread around the net (different accounts so in case you forget password to one, you still have the others.

I've spent so much time reading and watching videos about bitcoin. Now that every time I have to explain bitcoin value to other friends, I would need 1-2 hours and they will leave the conversation very confused.
I learned about the money, how it works. And how the government works. And how the entire economy is run. It's empowering, but can sometimes make me sound a bit grandiose among friends.

For bitcoin at least, I think he was talking about a multisig between the OT server and your client, to allow a transaction to go through. He talked about this in the advance clip, around 7 min in

Can you try brainwallet.org to see if they would generate the same addressed with that seed? Chose Chain tab on the site and enter the seed in the paper back up. Or you can try to restore it in Electrum as well. I tried a few times and all three software generated the same set of addresses created by any one of them.

I think it's different this time.
Hear me out.
Those companies have an obligation to make profit. And people speculate that these companies will succeed in doing that job.
Bitcoin is worthless. That's its strength. Its properties will never change. It didn't promise to give you profit or anything. It's a vehicle for transactions. Sure, people will distrust it. And flock away from it. But the ones who find the use for it will stay. If so then be it. if it can replace western union, it's perfect. Let's say A is in the US, A wants to send money to B in the UK. And C is in the UK, same city with B, want to send money to South Africa. A will send bitcoin to B, B will exchange it with C to get cash. And C will send the coins to whoever in Africa. The circle continue.
Bitcoin will continue doing that just fine. No promise in return. But it will be used in this way once it stabilizes. So I don't think this will be the end game. It's probably a bubble. But the bitcoin properties are still intact. Those dotcom companies are not though.

maybe starting with a wikipedia page is the best for you
Essentially at the core of bitcoin is the blockchain, an accountant book of all the accounts with every address' balance. This blockchain is distributed around the internet via something similar to BitTorrent. People who mine bitcoin put their computer to work to make sure no one can spend more than their balance in the blockchain. And every 10min on average they will append the new transactions on the network to the blockchain, making it a commonly agree version of history of the network.
The way address generated is very interesting. The address is the account ID, and every address has one (basic for now) private key, which controls the fund of that address in the blockchain. Since there are 2^256 possible address/key pair, it is almost certain that at any given moment in time you would not generate the same address as someone generated before. And all valid address can be recorded on the blockchain.
Of course, this is a very crude explanation. But I think that's the most intriguing.

Read the other thread for explanation. Essentially he imported a publicly-known private key address and forgot about it. His wallet used that address for sweeping the coins. 
Moral of the story: don't import compromised addresses.

nice article. it's exactly how I feel about today's tech companies. What?

try to exit armory completely (even from the tray or dock if you're on a mac). Then start it again with bitcoin-qt running. It'll take a few mins to read the blockchain
