Well it’s seen as Money vs Free press. Gawker argues that since Hogan was a public figure, the sex tape was newsworthy. It depends on which side you are on. People are divided on the issue. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:48:28
I explain by getting them started with some ETH. They get excited because of the free crypto they are getting and are more prone to actually try and listen to what I have to say. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:41:21
Not that I am supporting Gawker, but Hogan was having sex with his friends wife which is why Gawker claimed it as newsworthy. Hogan came out and said he was having sex with her after getting permission from her husband. Well, anyway. In the end, probably not newsworthy because it won’t affect neither your life nor mine. There is a documentary on Netflix you should watch about this whole thing.

Will depend on the futures market launch next week.

Check the transaction. It should appear after there are 2 confirmations. Usually about 15 to 20 mins. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:34:43
That’s ok. Coinbase actually tells you when you receive your BTC. Check back on that date. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:05:42
Well, what I was saying was, there is no Fiat. There will only be transactions with BTC. You get paid in BTC, you pay your taxes in crytBTCo, stock market is in BTC etc. The entire economy is in BTC. It won't happen by 2020 for sure like I said/questioned in the original comment. I was merely suggesting that the OP was concentrating on the wrong point of BTC. (Replace BTC with your favourite crypto store of value) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:45:36
Also why alts jump when BTC stabilizes. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:37:33
It was also a MASSIVE increase in price in 24 hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:31:16
It did dip below 15K in the US. It’s back up now though. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:04:15
Let me know if you need any help and welcome to crypto!

I think that was the point of the post.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:51:39
It’s certainly harder and the transition will take time. But if most sources of income, point of sales and property transfers are “required” to essentially know your customer just like it is today by the way, I don’t see BTC as being any different from cash. Markets that will get hit though will be savings and checking accounts, currency exchange (fiat currency exchange obviously). If USD loses control, all trades that have USD as the standard will see major changes. Essentially global markets without currency borders. Who knows what else. This might be the invention of our time like the internet was for our previous generation.

1. Open a GDAX account. 
2. GDAX has lower fees. You will need to wait until your money is transferred to GDAX (which can take a few days). Coinbase is instant locking of BTC price, but charges higher fees.
3. Use a desktop/phone wallet. Never lose your wallet seed. Always back it up. If you are unsure how this works, learn while your coins are in GDAX wallet. 
4. Hardware wallets like Ledger Nano S are the safest (as safe as you keep your seed/recovery phrase)

I introduced 8 people at my workplace last Friday to cryptocurrency by giving them approximately $20 worth of ETH or LTC each and asked them to watch Andreas' Introduction to Bitcoin on youtube as their return gift. I went home a happy man! Happy Holidays and happy HODLing everyone!

In the US, won’t I be subject to Capital Gains tax whenever I pay for coffee? The problem is not the tax itself but having to keep track of each transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:37:56
When you transfer to GDAX, it will appear in the USD wallet. I understand that you might want the money in there immediately but I strongly suggest transferring small amounts first just so you understand the process. In three or so days that money will appear in the GDAX USD wallet. Then you buy BTC with that money. It’s not automatic. You have to initiate that trade. As long as you can access GDAX you will be able to manage it from anywhere with internet access.

Bitcoin will not get a value assigned by governments. It does not need to. Bitcoin is not legal tender issued by a government. It’s value will depend on how much bread, a meal, other jewelry can you get for 1 BTC. When I said laws will come, it will be around things like my workplace reporting to the government how much they paid me (in bitcoins) in a year. All the laws will be around the edges. Governments will not be able to regulate how many BTCs there are or decide its value.
@_date: 2018-09-21 13:49:30
Probably. I mean, there shouldn’t be a capital gains tax (if used to buy things). Any tax (sales, VAT or otherwise) should just be collected in whatever currency the product is being bought at. The CG tax is the reason why I don’t go out of my way to find places where I can use crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:35:26
Honestly no one really knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:18:31
For now. Laws will come in the future. However as of now, it’s getting traded. It was not the original intention. It could also end up in a situation where BTC will remain to be gold and some other crypto will take over as currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:37:07
No need to trade it back to fiat by 2020? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:49:10
Well, first off, I read your comment wrong. I read your comment as "It has no laws" but you said, "It has no laws to enforce it as currency". I agree with you. I was kind of getting to this. BTC is commodity based currency. Meaning this is a new class. I don't know if governments will ever accept Taxes in gold, but I think they will at some point in BTC. New laws are bound to come in. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:12:44
Nope nope nope nope nope. I think enough people have told you why. Open 2 accounts if your friend does not have the time to monitor. He should let you manage your account as well. Invest in respective accounts.

Nice! What restaurant? Might drop by to tip in Bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:32:29
Wasn’t this the first recorded use of BTC as currency? Not sure. If that’s true, the pizza story is so cool.

Sell like 30% and pay some of that loan off. Paying off your loan (unless can handle it with your income) first before anything else if like finance 101. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:41:00
Well there is always some research that you could do. Diversification as well. Mine is like 85% large cap, 10% mid cap, 5% low cap approximately.

Why panic? This is how any market works. It’s as much as sentiment as it is about fundamentals. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:37:49
Stuff like this is probably why there is a lot of FUD within the general public. This probably puts the mass adoption back by a few months.

Going to be awake in 7 hours. LOL. HOLDing for now. Hopefully things don’t go to shit by then. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 01:33:42
Interesting. I just checked how much it would cost on Coinbase. $1.49 for a $25 order. I mean, Coinbase Pro is free, but these apps make is much more easy.

This world does come with its own downsides.

HODL it is. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:49:45
Correct. What I said is purely to reduce risk. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:52:59
Things like this should not go unpunished. Makes me so angry. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:47:13
All this smells so bad. Timing seems to be suspiciously impeccable. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:37:17
I don’t think this logic makes sense. If the general public is supposed to use this technology, it has to be regulated to some extent. Not everyone is savvy enough for crypto or good at financial management.

Just like many other things? Look at Net Neutrality. You either fight forever or lose at the start.

Wait until BTC drops after she “invests”. It will be your fault then.

I should mention that I am US (NY) resident. My options are limited. I can access GDAX, BITTREX and BINANCE legally speaking. Any other that I should be aware of?

You can buy fractions of a bitcoin.

I consider myself so lucky. My wife got into BTC and LTC just for fun in the beginning. She has now been reading up asked me about WTC and VTC last week and been bugging me to tell her about some exchanges she can use. She is a keeper.

Can I move my BTC (not B2X) for the lack of a better phrase, “out of the ledger” into an exchange safely without losing my B2X?

This is why anonymity should be built into the base protocol.

Or worse, they somehow made their money back and now have enough to show the USD necessary to prove the USDT backing. A theory that I pulled out of my ass.

I believe AES 256 is safe. Encoding process during 7-zip does not provide any security.  All the security is provided by AES.

Wrong.  This is the origin of HODL. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:44:22
Looks like everyone is asking to HODL. I guess HODL it is.

Do you have a copy of the security seed that was used to create your 2FA in google authenticator? If so, I believe you can manually enter it in the authenticator app in your new phone and use the codes that are generated.

So, you are just trying to look better than you look now?

I can move it safely from the ledger nano legacy chain to ledger nano segwit? Once my BTC is in a segwit address, can I move it to BTC wallets in Coinbase, GDAX, Bittrex and Binance? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:28:28

Coinbase is good to begin with. Move on to GDAX (this is what Coinbase uses) overtime.

Cost basis as in, at what dollar amount did the bitcoin get converted to fiat on that particular day?

Do we (in the US) have to report all of these transactions in our tax forms? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:55:56
How would you go about doing that while also obtaining the two coins? Move coin from one BTC to another BTC wallet. Then use the keys from the first one to restore a B2X wallet?
