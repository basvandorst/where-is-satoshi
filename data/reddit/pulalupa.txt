One of the most interesting things to me is that the next 'Gox' scam might be preventable:
"If you search reddit you will find a few Coinbet promos created by 'bitcoinsource'. After a few months of OP haggling with Coinbet, he then deals with a 'Michael Carter'. It is likely no coincidence that around March 17th, CTO of DCE-24 Michael Carter launched the new 'Bitsource' bitcoin exchange platform. I imagine if we connect the dots we can do something here.
Also please take a look at this link:
Please note the prominence of Coinbet promotions on this page. It is fairly obvious to me there is a connection as OP alleged in the first post. If I had to guess, Coinbet is merely a larger front to fund this business with the intent to either 'Gox' a lot of people all over again, or simply to fund the exchange."

Here is the insane thread about what happened:
The scamming, shady culture of bitcoin is likely to be its own undoing.

The absolutely insane story of why this happened:

Thats my question!  I don't know which wallet allows me to withdraw to my bank.  Coinbase if for USA only as I understand.  Does BitStamp allow me to withdraw to my philippine bank? Is there another wallet that is better?

edit:  I've googled for info quite a bit but being new to bitcoin I can't find any definitive/good answer.  I have also submitted documents to bitstamp...hopefully this is a possibility.

No I have a friend who is going to send me bitcoins to me...but I don't know which wallet allows me to then cash out to my Phillipine bank account.  Maybe this is an easy answer but I am unable to find the information =(
