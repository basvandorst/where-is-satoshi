Unless they are being paid to produce results. In that case they could lose money from bad reviews if they dont help you. I guess you just gotta find someone you can trust. Lucky for me I have found a few brilliant traders that are willing to offer their help

 Subject: RE:Crash in bitcoin 0.1.0  
 To: hal.finney
Normally I would keep the symbols in, but they increased the size of  the EXE from 6.5MB to 50MB so I just couldn’t justify not stripping  them. I guess I made the wrong decision, at least for this early  version. I’m kind of surprised there was a crash, I’ve tested heavily  and haven’t had an outright exception for a while. Come to think of it,  there isn’t even an exception print at the end of debug.log. I’ve been  testing on XP SP2, maybe SP3 is something.
I’ve attached bitcoin.exe with symbols. (gcc symbols for gdb, if you’re using MSVC I can send you an MSVC build with symbols)
Thanks for your help!
\&gt;Hi Satoshi – I tried running bitcoin.exe from the 0.1.0 package,  and &gt;it crashed. I am running on an up to date version of XP, SP3.  The &gt;debug.log output is attached. There was also a file db.log but  it was &gt;empty.  
 \&gt;  
 \&gt;The crash allowed me to start up a debugger, but there were no  &gt;symbols. The exception was at address 00930AF7. The displayed call  &gt;stack was 942316 called by 508936.  
 \&gt;  
 \&gt;When I have a chance, I’ll try building it, although it looks like it
\&gt;would take me a while to acquire all the dependencies. &gt;  
 \&gt;Hal

The only reason one would think that is his words. He claimed he was no longer involved with Bitcoin when asked about it in 2014. It may or may not have been a misspoken accident. I dont think it was Dorian personally.

Well Bitcoin is a direct competitor to the USD. They may have thought hiding their identity would prevent retaliation from the govt. If I created something that in theory could take down the USD I would be worried about retaliation as well. Just a thought :)

Better safe than sorry. If a US citizen sent that to Iran they could be in serious trouble. The LN torch went through many hands starting with HODLNAUT on Twitter. My friend Phil Groner was  They add 100,000 sats every time. It was sent to Iran from Wales I believe.

LN is still new. Give it a few years... 
@_date: 2019-02-20 16:43:45
You picked a good time. Bitcoin is lower now than when I first started. I first bought in around 8k in November of 2017. I always kicked myself for waiting too long to get in, but alas, the price went down January thru today and is currently hovering around 4k. I have been buying a bit everytime I get paid so my DCA is looking decent at this point, but starting now is similar to starting in August of 2017. Just one piece of advice, do not invest what you are not prepared to lose. If you invest in this way you will have a better chance of not allowing your emotions to come into play. Panic sellers never win. If you cannot control your emotions you cannot control your money. Good luck to you!

@_date: 2019-02-13 13:56:38
This is a loaded question. I say donate it to me
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:13:11
well it all boils down to miners as a necessity. To me increasing transaction fees is almost certain even without LN as towards the end of the mining of all BTC (2140 estimated) Miners will only have transaction fees as no more new BTC will be rewarded for creating blocks. But if I were to use LN with Phil for years we could avoid transaction fees altogether pretty much and only pay when we close the channel which could be 2 days or 50 years potentially. People enjoy speculating on the idea that LN could be a wolf in labs clothing because it will stop miners from collecting fees and cause them to stop mining. This is not going to occur if you ask me. LN will attract many more users than BTC currently enjoys and I believe that when LN is full blown BTC miners may even lower fees due to the gargantuan amount of new users and retail stores utilizing the LN. Like I said, everything is speculation. We need to sit back and let LN grow. It is the only way to see if it will work. Thats why I refer to it as an experiment 
@_date: 2019-02-11 15:35:10
Store it on a trezor or nano. If you feel like splitting the coins up is a good idea grab 2 nanos or 2 trezors
@_date: 2019-02-27 19:45:22
@_date: 2019-02-20 16:45:15
If you are going to just buy it and sit on it you should look into a trezor or nano. These wallets are miles ahead of hot wallets when it comes to security. (Hot wallets are any wallet connected to the net)
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:56:10
Lets say I buy coffee from phil every morning and we utilize the LN. I could put in 1 BTC into the wallet and everytime I got my coffee a small amount of BTC would transfer from me to Phil. We could keep the channel open because we understand that I do come by daily and opening and closing channels is more work than necessary not to mention the transaction fees accrue by closing a channel after each transaction. A channel can theoretically be open forever. Only being closed when a party decides that they no longer need to use the channel and want the BTC in a personal wallet. When they close the channel it is recorded to the BTC blockchain as 1 transaction and the fee for it would be the same as if me and Phil did the transaction (one time) on BTC core.  The whole idea behind LN is faster transactions and smaller fees. Who wants to buy coffee for 2$ with a 3$ transaction fee? LOL. This is one reason you could keep a LN channel open for a long time.
