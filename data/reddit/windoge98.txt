If it becomes widely adopted, it is almost certain it will break $800 again.

If that's actually your private key I'd recommend taking it down

I am *so* confused about this as well.
This is enormous news... right? Why hasn't the price moved at all?
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:58:16
I can't believe this mostly because 100k a coin seems fucking crazy to me...

He may have posted a decoy or something. It would be incredibly stupid to actually post a picture of a private QR key...

Your humor is extremely out of place here.
I'm fairly new to the Bitcoin game, but why should I believe your essay of empty platitudes when you just happen to be someone who got lucky and bought in early? If it's true that you have 120,000 BTC, then at this moment - even in the price lull - you have the equivalent of approx 63 MILLION USD. Sure, you lost 550 BTC...
That's nothing to you, why should you even care? The loss of 550 BTC doesn't phase you. You have a lot to gain by making this post. You could potentially lose a lot more wealth from the value of BTC dropping, so of course you want people to have confidence.
What makes you the sole bastion of truth when it comes to Bitcoin? Honestly, your post states nothing factual and says nothing of substance. I have almost zero stake in Bitcoin but your tone is offputting when you have more wealth than anyone could even hope to gain. Tell me - what makes you so much more intelligent that your advice is that of which I should listen to? What sets you apart from someone who just happened to get extremely lucky and won the Bitcoin lottery?
I see nothing to back up anything you posted.
EDIT: Grammar

It's okay Tzadik. I'm here for you.

Prices haven't moved... this is confusing me

A NASCAR car is literally going to have Dogecoin pictures all over it because the Dogecoin community raised enough money to make it happen.
If you are not taking Dogecoin seriously yet, I can't take you seriously.

Everyone keeps parroting this shit but I am not buying it one bit. There haven't been any significant price rises before this announcement. *Nobody bought any rumors* and even if they did there hasn't been any upward movement.
This sentiment makes little to no sense to me right now.

Copied from a reply in r/Bitcoin
I think Amazon will be the last company to adopt Bitcoin.  Being the dominate player in eCommerce there just isn't any benefit for them in it they probably already get the best credit card rates of anyone on earth, they have their own branded Visa card, They are a registered money service business.  The current system suites them just fine I have a feeling.
Not saying it wouldn't be cool, just saying I doubt they will do it until they have no choice.
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:59:46
Amazon will be the last to take BTC if it ever gets to that point
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:16:43
He has over 120k bitcoin (65 million USD). I doubt he'll miss it.

You're right. "got lucky and bought in early" was disingenuous. Thanks for correcting me

**Really?** All we've seen in recent months is down, down, down. How on earth would this NOT drive prices up if it hits WSJ? I'm probably just a dumb noob but I'm interested to hear why this would drive us down so much.
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:50:37
is this real?!
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:41:49
Thank you kind shibe!
@_date: 2014-09-08 19:47:15
Dumb noob me confirmed.
Though I still fail to see where they would have profited off of this. I would have expected a slow steady rise for months followed by the news and the selloff. Yet even if they did buy months ago, that would mean they bought higher and lost, correct? I'm sure there's something significant I'm missing.

What. A comment like this? Upvoted? In r/bitcoin?
Somebody pinch me...

It would be hilarious if you could make the track generate based on how well a player lands the transitions.
Good landing produces slopes ahead that generally trend upward
Bad landing summons a bear slide to rock bottom 
Probably more complicated than it sounds though
