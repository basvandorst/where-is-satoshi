I don’t think that is even physically possible - the energy demands for Bitcoin to fill any of those rolls is astronomical.

Are you know seriously proposing perpetual motion?
You know that is impossible, right?

Not without trade offs. And those trade offs are the same ones that keep some using Bitcoin instead of other coins.

I’m really not sure how to communicate this.
The choices required to use less energy have consequences. Things like less secure transactions (less replay protection), less anonymous transactions, adjustment algorithms with larger swings, client implementations that may fail against each other, increased time to sync the blockchain, etc.

As someone that uses gold as a commodity I really wish people would stop investing in gold.

Wait, you honestly think Bitcoin could use less energy with just some changes of code and zero consequences?
Think about that for a second - what reason is there, that isn’t evil, to use more energy than required?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:18:22
Maybe what?  The laws of thermodynamics?


Look into processing power required. More processing power = more energy. 
Here is an article about Bitcoin’s energy usage. 
I’m not saying there aren’t options, but I am saying those options have trade offs and consequences.

Did I miss a joke?

That assumes it already exists. This is like asking "What social network could possibly pass MySpace?" in 2003 or "What MP3 player has a better chance of succeeding than the Creative Nomad?" in 2000. 
For what currently exists people are actually spending Doge. Sure a lot of it is just silly tipping fractions of pennies, but people actually using it is better than treating it like an investment.

It varies by bank. I use one of the large evil banks, because when you have enough money in your account they do shitloads free (including certified checks, wire transfers, and more). However if you don't have much in your account they charge for pretty much anything/everything.

That is pretty much the definition of journalism. People often don't want to talk to the media. Sometimes the best way to get a lead is to try and book fake appointments. I know personal secretaries to politicians that *will not* talk about *anything* if they receive a call and it isn't the normal booking agent/secretary/organizer. They will hang up and call the main office of whoever the caller claimed they were from.

For all of Jan and most of Feb there were more Doge transactions. 
Think about how fewer people use Doge.

They might be called secured credit cards in your area.

Hardware. Ever try getting a cheap, random TV card working in Linux?  Now try imagining have 5 cheap, random cards you need to interact with.

The only companies consistently bringing in the amount of cash and profit as Apple are in the oil business.  They don't really need to change anything, and don't really need to continue to grow (you don't see people saying Exxon or BP need continued growth).
