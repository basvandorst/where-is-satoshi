lol, none of you are using bitcoin, you’re all hodling. Whether it’s in some ETF cold wallet or your own, it’s getting just as much use and interaction with the blockchain.

At least in a retail account you can use the losses to offset your income, in a retirement account you’re just eating into retirement - until the mewn that is

Not if they don't touch it, don't access it, don't spend it, don't transfer it and simply HODL. And of course that's only true if they didn't leave it in an exchange. If they bought it on the exchange and HODLd it there, they never even got the keys in the first place. If they bought it, then transferred it to their own wallet, they interacted to get it, they they intentionally stopped.

Can we agree that that's not true if you buy and HODL on an exchange? And that there's basically no difference between HODLing 1 share of the proposed ETF and HODLing 25BTC on Coinbase?

You know certain EU countries (like Switzerland) have negative interest rates, and their economies continue to hum along right? No giant explosions there.

Hey cool! I just found some money from back in 2014. What a time to be alive. Thanks, fiat currency! Luckily I don't have to scour the garbage dump looking for the keys.

Check out online banks like Ally or Schwab, or if you have a lot of money, HSBC Premier or JP Morgan. No fees for anything.

Their assets and liabilities are totally made up. They promised audits every six months for the last four years or something and each time the auditors get close they fire them. Luckily they’re not going to get away from the NYAG audit. In fact I think they still list the missing $825 million as an asset because they “believe that it’s going to be recovered one day” even though it’s frozen by various world governments for money laundering.

Tether and bitfinex have the same ownership structure. Both of them effectively lost access to banking infrastructure years ago. Various world governments have seized about $850 million backing tether for money laundering (just ask the New York AG), and we know BFX been raiding the coffers there too.
So what’s this insolvent entity to do? Print tether not backed by anything, transfer to tether denominated exchanges, buy bitcoin (driving the price sky high, attracting new suckers) then transfer to USD exchanges with banking relationships and sell it off for real money.
Free, unlimited money so long as (a) nobody catches on and (b) the upward spike caused by their fraudulent buying brings in new FOMO money on top of what they brought in.
(1) print un-backed tether (2) transfer to USDT backed exchanges (3) buy BTC to move prices up, arbitrage bots even out the pricing moving other exchanges up too (4) withdraw BTC to a USD exchange (5) sell to people who are FOMOing in due to the spike they created (6) hide from the NYAG and the Russians and the narcos.

Fraud. Just ask the NYAG :)

Right so which is it? Asset or currency? They’re mutually exclusive.

Currencies aren't meant to be saved, they're meant to be spent. That's the point. If you wanna to save/invest, do so by purchasing productive assets. This is basically the definition of capitalism.
@_date: 2019-04-17 05:45:26
Haha, then why did you sell at all? You just made tax work for yourself, and lost long-term gains preferential treatment.

Even if he went to all of Europe, Africa and Asia I'm not sure he'd find a single retailer lol, and I can't really think of a single industry in which PayPal is a monopoly. They compete in peer-to-peer payments with Square and numerous other individual banks, in eCommerce with Stripe, in brick-and-mortars with Square, Stripe and myriad others. Even eBay no longer makes them the sole option AFAIK after the spin-off. They compete with cryptocurrencies like an elephant compete with a tick.
@_date: 2019-01-24 03:22:55
Nah, Bitcoin is 10 years old. When PayPal was 10, it already had 81MM active users. Luckily for us thats right around when they were spun off from eBay so the usage data's available for us. They were doing way, way better than Bitcoin the whole time.
Square's a good example too, they're 10 years old this year, and they've got 2 million merchants.

iOS devices use SSDs with transparent encryption, and the erase function is performed by deleting the encryption key. I believe T2 devices like the iMac Pro behave the same way. SFYL.

"over 900" accept bitcoin cash, which means they almost certainly accept bitcoin too lol [ \-- combining Europe, Africa and Asia we got... 415 after a decade. Thats 41.5 merchants per year. I'm sure PayPal and their 715 million customers and 17 million merchants (41,000X) are shitting their collective pants.
@_date: 2019-01-03 06:33:55
Ah for some reason I thought it was an iMac Pro.
@_date: 2019-01-24 03:15:23
No you're right, it was wrong of me. Data's hard to find, because it's terribly underwhelming. [coinmap.org]( seems to be the best I could find, with 14,000 locations (not companies, including all ATMs). That's still 1200X more PayPal merchants. And as for major merchants, I believe the number is 5, down from 6 year over year. Crapping their pants, I assure you.

No, I get it, I just don’t think it matters to me or to the vast majority of people in the face of it’s active user hostile nature.

In my opinion what holds poor people back in America isn’t regulatory bodies like the SEC/CFTC but rather elimination of the 77% estate tax over the years (which by definition creates an approximately equal starting point from generation to generation by preventing generational wealth; trust fund kids didn’t earn their money or create any value). It’s the progressive weakening of trade unions to push back against corporations. It’s the lack of a livable minimum wage. It’s the progressive defunding of infrastructure and education. It’s the lack of socialized medicine. These all serve to lift up the bottom 99% and reign in the top 1%. This allows wealth to be distributed on merit and not on luck, and makes the country a better place to live for everyone.
I’d say low taxes too but America’s tax rate in the coastal states is unbelievably high - higher than my birth province of Ontario - California top marginal is 57% before the recent tax bill and in the mid-60s after. It’s just largely squandered.

Heh, there are, it's called *the existing financial system.* Had you sent money to the wrong account there's no world in which they'd just get to keep it.
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:36:24
The process in the US is documented there, banks have an in-formal code they all agree to which will allow you to try and claw the money back, if it doesn't work you can indeed sue as it's illegal for the recipient to spend that money. They can and do get criminally charged for doing so.
@_date: 2019-05-22 07:46:09
Sure, but there's no world in which I'd roll up to some random guy on the street and hand him a half-pound of gold (~$8000/1BTC) without looking at him and seeing if they're the right person. That's why it works.
