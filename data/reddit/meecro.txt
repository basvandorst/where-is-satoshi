Gute idee! Ich bin auch eher paperwallets zugeneigt, mit hardware wallets hab ich gar keine erfahrung, nur theoretisch ein wenig. Du meinst wohl trezor bezueglich open source. ist aber ganz praktisch, kann man mit sich tragen, soweit ich weis 'gefahrenlos' in ein eventuell virus-beladenes pc-system stecken (nicht das ich das unbedingt empfehlen wuerde:-)), aber wollte mir da auch noch genauer ansehen wie die keys dann genau abgesichert sind. es gibt da allerhand was man machen kann, z.b. eine transaktion komplett offline erstellen, diese mit dem private key signieren und dann broadcasten. da gibts einige moeglichkeiten. ja, online ist gar keine gute idee:-)was die hardware wallets angeht, da gabs auch schon scheinbar so spezialisten die gebrauchte bei ebay etc. verkauft haben, und das ging teilweise gar nicht gut aus...

Top! Buildl. Your comment inspired me to learn more about Bitcoin. Thank you.

thank you. i guess they are working with bots or something.

Hi! Kurz gesagt, ja - du hast dieselbe menge der fork-coins. Um diese zu 'erhalten'(claim), ist es noetig deine private keys in einer wallet der jeweiligen fork einzutragen (einlesen zu lassen) - bitte sei vorsichtig mit deinen private keys, und welche wallet du benutzt. Es gab und gibt leider sehr viele fakes, die schinderlud mit deinen private keys treiben. Was du machen solltest, aber natuerlich erst wenn du dich selbst ausreichend genug informiert hast - erstelle eine neue Bitcoin Wallet (mit einer wallet deiner wahl, z.b. Electrum) und sende die Bitcoins die du hast dorthin. Nun hast du deine leere Wallet 1. Die Private Keys dieser brauchst du um die Fork-Coins (cash/gold) zu 'claimen'. Deine Bitcoins sollten zunaechst aber auf jeden fall in deiner neuen, zweiten wallet sein. Es gibt tutorials die beschreiben diesen vorgang sehr genau, nicht so dahergeschludert wie ich das jetzt hier gemacht habe. Bitte passe genau auf das du keine fake-software benutzt, du keinen trojaner/virus (stichwort clipboard-trojaner oder scam-websites. check immer die url) auf deinem pc hast, und das du deine alten private keys erst fuers claimen benutzt wenn die dazugehoerigen public adressen auch leer sind.
Edit: Hey, much thanks for my first silver!!!!!!!

Genau, sozusagen geschenkt. Hier kannst du dich wenn du grad eh dabei bist darueber informieren was genau bei einer fork passiert. Ich hoffe fuer dich das du da in eine lernspirale geraetst:-) (eventuell wirst du dann auch noch etwas ueber python scripts wissen wollen um deine eigenen public/private keys zu generieren, etc...) Super idee! Denk dran - es hat keine eile mit dem claimen, deine coins auf der fork-chain vergehen nicht einfach so! Also lass dir zeit und schaffe erstmal das richtige 'umfeld', genauso wie bei einer neuen wallet. Da gibts dann auch verschiedene methoden derer ich mich bediene, z.b. erstmal kleinere 'test-betraege' senden oder so. Ich wuerde (und habe) erstmal eine weile abgewartet, dann meine coins auf eine neue wallet gesendet, und die alten adressen in einer Cash-Wallet einlesen lassen. Was das weitere investieren in btc angeht, tja ich denke du wirst deinen weg fuer dich finden wenn du dich weiter darueber informierst wie bitcoin genau funktioniert - du scheinst ja schon eine ahnung darueber zu haben, und bekundest zum glueck weiteres interesse, bist wissbegierig - nicht bloß gierig:-)ich persoenlich betrachte es als eine art bankkonto das man dir nicht wegnehmen kann, und gebe mir muehe so weit es geht, 
1. meine private keys fuer mich zu halten (coins von einer exchange herunternehmen) 'not your keys, not your bitcoin'
2. mich nicht allzusehr von dem finanziellen wert bitcoins ablenken zu lassen, sondern eher dem (eco)system cryptocurreny im allgemeinen mehr beachtung zu schenken, und vielleicht auch mal was beizutragen
3. Wenn du in der gluecklichen position bist, momentan finanziell relativ sorglos und ohne not zu sein - wunderbar! Ich finde das ist eine gute ausgangsposition. Achja, ich wiederhole mich zwar, aber bei all den scams da draußen - check die url, check die files die du downloadest (verify download with pgp signature), und verfalle nicht 'Gier frisst Hirn'. Ich fuehl mich einfach besser diese ratschlaege oeffentlich nochmals daherzuschreiben, auch wenn ich mich wiederhole:-)Falls du weitere fragen hast - sehr gerne und jederzeit!

Is there an bitcoin atm in your area? Regarding the recent news about crypto/india, i don't think thats likely, but maybe. Do you maybe know someone who could sell to you in person? Or maybe an app (RobinHood?) The people here already listed some good links. There are also some youtube videos about p2p exchanges.
But remember: 
1. Always keep your private keys
2. Do your due diligence
3. Don't get greedy - invest only what you can afford to loose 100%, or better yet don't view buying bitcoins as investing in terms of selling for dollar in the future - bitcoin is so much more. Think about how many satoshis you have, how much you can do with them in terms of transactions that are proof on the blockchain.
Before i drift off too much: All good to you, and watch out for scammers, as there seems to be a lot of them out there, unfortunately.

It's cool that your willing to help here - i live in germany, and it would be cool if there was an community here in the region where i live (Stuttgart) where people could go to to sell and buy bitcoin p2p, but i imagine it very hard to find willing people to build up a trustworthy group so to speak. Mhm i guess i should research meetups in stuttgart and the stuttgart reddit, maybe there are some others interested in such ideas too.

do you remember the exact error? had you transferred it over network or external drive?
@_date: 2019-11-28 13:14:46
Ahh...which is it in Germany? Here it seems pretty unregulated, with bitwala and such. But please correct me if i'm wrong. Would love to do more and help a good cause.

here is a someone with a similar error
but i remember that i had some similar error, and i did restart the bitcoin client - i can't remember exactly. i also restarted the pi, and that, with the client restarting, seemed to work, cleared the catch or something i guess. I guess it's just a corrupted file (maybe that rev01310.dat), and perhaps you could sync the blockchain again? I will setup a node in the coming days myself, i'll detail my steps and keep you updated. i think i will using a raspberryPi, as it has more memory - the rpi3 made problems, and i never got around figuring out formatting the disk so that i could move the blockchain from windows to linux. That i still have to figure out. I'll keep you updated, and sorry for the good mess in my post. Please keep at troubleshooting this problem! Try another way, try some things out, keep up at it, you got this far, go a little bit further! greetings.

How exactly? Got any error messages for us? Where did you get stuck?
@_date: 2019-11-28 13:05:40
Mhm but wasn't there some trouble with .org tld in recent days? Something about a private company buying up all .org domains?

I have a rp3+ lying around, and started installing noobs on it - next step would be installing bitcoin core, and with that all the needed dependecies. 
Afair one of the most 'complex' steps was installing berkeley db. you have to install a very specific version of it (4.x?) so you have to download it from oracle, then add flags in your bitcoin core installation pointing to the file location - but that's just a heads up, i'll add a detailed explanation with all the steps and intermediate steps.

That was a shared paypal account? Or did they just banned you because you happened to reside at the same address?

Ahhh testnet, that's what i was looking for - i theorized about some cloud-computing mining for bootstrapping the app in the beginning. thanks, that brought some clearity. so one of the important aspects should be that the node can be run very efficient and silent, as every user needs to install one. I'm just thinkering out loud here a little bit. It does seem interesting, and to the why: that's what i'm trying to figure out, too - why would you implement a blockchain? what would be the case in which that would be more favorable? Unfortunately, i don't have an complete answer to that for you now, but the words immutable ledger seem very convenient to somebody who wants to record some important things on a blockchain. The thought alone that you can store something pretty safely on a global ledger which you and you alone have access to, is also pretty neat. At least that's how it works as far as i have understood it. Thanks for your answers!
@_date: 2019-08-16 08:19:41
Do you use linux over windows because it's faster on that old machine of yours?
Edit: Also, thanks and congrats! My RaspberryPi 3 got stuck a couple of times, probably because of the 1gb ram. Now it can't access the external drive with the blockchain on it, i'm figuring out how to change it to read-write from just read without having to format it. Any help maybe?
@_date: 2019-10-05 10:12:03
mhm so the IP address seems to be it u/sexyama
Yeah, it's a bad feeling to keep control of your own data from you like that. Shouldn't be necessary to have to trust someone that they delete your data after x time.
@_date: 2019-10-27 18:32:52
How could you implement a PoW Blockchain in your app as a single developer? Serious question. Don't you need at least some miners who provide computing power to secure the blockchain? Or would a possible model be that the devices on which the app is installed act as miners/nodes themselves?

Everyone transaction is public on the blockchain, and can be viewed by anyone.
I don't know a lot about the details, so please don't take my word for it. Maybe someone here can present a more detailed view. That'd be great. But every transaction can be traced back to some extent, if not as far as to it's coinbase (the block that created those coins) - it's an public ledger after all.
I apologize for errors on my side. Go check the bitcoin wiki, or the lopp resources, there's also the Resources section of this subreddit. I hope i could help you, and please keep asking questions!
@_date: 2019-12-13 13:32:49

Hey, thanks for your reply! The privacy-part on domain registration is neat! I'll definitely look into WooCommerce. Regarding the LN payments - couldn't you just run your own node with LN on top, and use your own channels that way? I sure do have a lot of questions, for example - how did you gather all this knowledge?  or:
Do you think it would be a good idea to give out some free little gimmicks(buttons, stickers) to bootstrap my shop a little in the beginning? 
Much Much thanks for your answer. I now go and look into WooCommerce a little. So the checklist is Domain/Hosting/CMS/Payment, and that plugin sounds great. I like the design of your website! And it's great that you keep the philosophy of crypto. I thought about hiring a designer on fivverr for a couple of logos (although there are a lot free logos available), but that way i'd help someone else also.
So for now, i'll look for some shopsite-templates, to lay the foundation, and then the domain. I'll keep it updated, and thanks again for your answer! I have a lot to learn, and i am very glad that there are people like you out there, willing to give help! Thank you!

Install a mobile wallet on your phone, (electrum) create a wallet, and then send your bitcoin to one of the addresses of your new created wallet. Don't forget to backup your seed, and don't download phishingware, i heard that another electrum phishing version is around. Electrum also has a desktop version, but always download it from the official source,  [ \- and verify your download. In short: Send your coins to addresses off which you own the private key. Backup your seed. Always check addresses before sending (clipboard hacks have been know to happen) further questions? Please ask. And please don't follow just any advice...do your due diligence.
