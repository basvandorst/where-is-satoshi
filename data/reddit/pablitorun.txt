Why did you refer to the USD amount?
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:40:47
wow, after reading that....good luck getting more mainstream acceptance of the currency.  No one is going to take the time to understand it and 95% of people aren't even going to be capable of comprehension....it's just "implementation issue" and they will never ever touch it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:58:31
Well most people like to be proven right.

It's an interesting analogy but flawed.  If people believed TCP/IP banking was unsecure then e-commerce would have been a non-starter.

Be careful a stop loss is no good against two magic words...."no bid"
@_date: 2015-01-29 14:27:39
That price stability feature of bitcoin.

Of all the bullshit loss rationalizations this is the bull shittiest.
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:53:55
I have seen a number of bubbles come and go, we will know the bottom has been reached when posts like yours don't reach the bitcoin front page.  
I am patiently waiting for capitulation.

The problem is the only lessons that you had to pay to learn here were the ones you didn't learn.
1.) Never fall in love with your investments
2.) The trend is your friend.
Everything else is summed up by my good friend Will
"you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on a fuckin education you coulda got for a dollah fifty in late chahges at the public library"
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:23:49
That's what is called a no-bid.  
Please don't invest anymore until you learn these things.

Yes a stop loss can cause you to sell at terrible times if you place them around support lines. Stop limits though run the risk of leaving you in the position.

Not sure what you think these devices are going to be, but no mobile phone manufacturer is going to want that chip anywhere near their devices without being very well compensated.  That would seriously kill any battery life of a mobile device for very little purpose.

Well there is an advantage to the pool owner.......
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:55:47
It's more of a checkout and payment system then anything.  One without the ability to set a price strangely enough.
I can't wait to pay for shitty memes......

In three years those bitcoins will be at least $1 million.  This is good for you.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:44:32
you know how I can tell you have never looked up the definition of commodity or currency?
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:30:13
money (currency) by it's very definition is a commodity.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:49:08
also you are right, I mean availability in that sense that you could acquire it if you want to, not that it would necessarily be cheap. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:00:42
Cigarettes have many aspects that make them a handy substitute currency.
Mainly they are fungible and the packs are easily dividable into smaller units.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:41:23
basically bitcoin has the same problem as gold.
When its in an appreciating phase people don't spend they accumulate.  This lowers its use as a currency.
Eventually there is a realization that the currency has no intrinsic value, and it enters a depreciation phase.  Then the cycle begins again.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:41:01
i meant widely available in a localized economy, a commodity that is not found in another location is not a commodity in that location (see....the middle age quest for spices.)
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:36:02
the concept of a currency out of the hands of a government entity is not flawed.  Bitcoin is flawed because of it's self limiting growth.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:46:55
the spice must flow....
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:51:50
an excellent point!  perhaps that is why the rest of the world is not on the cig standard.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:34:33
it's also the case that all currencies are commodities, a commodity
is  1.) Fungible and 2.) Widely available -- currencies fit these definitions exactly.
 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:38:54
I didn't invest.  I am just asking you what you think the value of a bitcoin should be and why. I don't know the answer, I just know I would never allow it as method of payment unless I was allowed to enter into a net short position as currency risk could absolutely kill me.  (Anyone who accepted a bitcoin payment for goods or services just sold it for 75% off.)
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:33:47
why would it go to $400? Bitcoin is absolutely worthless as a medium of exchange with the sort of price volatility it experiences.
