I'm not here to change your mind about BTC. This is my opinion. I'm just saying that some coins are much better imo
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:47:01
I wouldn't put it in my will. People read the will well before your children.
Just give it to them
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:02:16
Reading the title i was like wtf, how did you gain money. All coins are down rn (most of them anyway)
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:55:31
wtf? 
Begging for donations for an idea as simple as this? damn
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:12:53
i've made more money in altcoins in the last 2 weeks than i have in the year that i was invested in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:35:48
Bitcoin fees are high right now. I wouldn't recommend buying it, go for something else. But if you really want to you have to pay the fees.
Most transactions will take multiple hours now aswell
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:58:04
As I said, not much of a choice right now
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:49:05
unfortunately, i don't have a choice right now.
I have to trade in euros, and most if not all sites where that's possible have a minimum of 100€ spending. Coinbase is the only one i can wire money to. As little or as much as i want.
I don't have the option to spend 100€ at a time unless i wait a month everytime. I spend about 50 every month
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:57:13
I know, i'm aware of all of it. But you can't deny that waiting hours and paying immensly high fees for BTC is just ridiculous
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:35:21
He probably won't make the same mistake again indeed, considering he put his life savings in it and he's probably broke now
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:44:12
You still can't predict prices though
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:42:35
I don't invest more than i can afford to lose. It's just that that 50€ will be spent on useless shit. So instead i invest it in crypto. 
I've been doing this for 3+ months now and i'm pretty educated on crypto, i'm not claiming i'm an expert or anything.
I know why people have a problem with coinbase. The whole insider trading thing did a number on the trust they have. But unless all those other services don't require a minimum of 100 I will do it the coinbase way.
I've not sold a single coin yet so the panic selling won't happen. I'm in it for the long game.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:08:04
who doesn't? I don't even own BTC anymore
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:35:07
I'm not offended. I was just saying it's not **all** american.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:11:56
Still that's not even close to 100%
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:03:55
If I don't do it in the beginning of the paycheck I'll probably spend that 50 so yes.
And I still don't see the problem with coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:22:57
Bitcoin the best coin? There's plenty of coins with much better tech behind it. Bitcoin is falling behind miserably
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:35:48
Unless you're being threatened with legal action
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:31:46
Of course, but if i'd been in some of the alts 2 years earlier i could've retired aswell. 
And I think the alts i'm invested in have much higher potential than Bitcoin. I'm not saying they'll ever be 10k a coin, but they have much better tech behind it.
Bitcoin's technology is old and bad compared to some alt coins, and i think it'll fall off the ladder quite quick once people realise this
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:58:10
wtf, taking out a 25k loan for bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:17:36
I know, I'm just saying that it's not all american in here.
I'm also not the person who said that
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:30:21
Depends on how old he is. 20% of my savings is about 200€. I've got plenty more in crypto than that
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:40:19
Honestly, i haven't had any trouble with them so far so i'm fine doing it like this for now
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:47:02
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:40:27
i agree
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:08:51
Press the arrow up?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:05:13
Yeah i get it. It's just a nice idea i guess.
I wish i had bitcoin, i've been lurking around here for a month or 2 now but don't have more than 10 euros a month to spend on bitcoin right now so idk if it's worth it
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:03:10
I'm a bit of a noob, but to process a transaction is not the same thing as that article you linked. That's about mining bitcoins right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:26:08
Ok, i'm pretty new to all these crypto currencies and have been reading up for about a month now. Roger ver has come up quite alot recently and i don't really know why. 
Who is he and what has he done wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:16:17
I'm learning slow and steady!
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:02:26
in case of bitcoin, it's probably more likely to be a 100.000 one
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:15:23
Wait what? why? I don't have firefox installed so i can't check rn
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:18:30
I always expect some heartfelt story about someone finally paying off their house and other debts...
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:17:41
Way less what? If you mean the 21 million, it is actually limited to 21 million. Not all of them have been mined yet and it doesn't account for the lost bitcoins. The figure is still correct though
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:51:29
Any chance you have some links where i can read up on things like this? No idea what "LN" is for example
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:24:32
That article is from last year
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:08:13
right, got ya, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:07:39
I really don't understand some things. 
I'm a noob at crypto. And i'm still researching before i'm getting in. But i've already made an account at Coinbase/GDAX, Gatehub and since i am european i also have an account at Litebit. That's where i'm planning to buy since i can buy with IDeal (a way to buy things online with a bank account)
And when i check there it adds €0,45 to every transaction. Why are people saying the fees are so high?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:47:00
It's not about the money. It's about sending a message
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:19:32
RemindMe! June 13th 2018, 11:42 GMT "Has bitcoin reached 100k yet?"
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:53:16
just curious, how much bitcoin do you have? if you're really that broke but you have let's say 1 or 2 bitcoin, can't you just tell half a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:41:58
I have someone at work (or more like, had) who ha**d** bitcoins. He had over 1500, he's retired now.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:46:17
I would've said you were right, but you're not lol
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:47:22
Wait what? 


You know nothing about me. You live a sad life if you don't trust anyone or anything
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:08:19
LOL you are fucking pathetic. Calling people worms and shit, thinking you're superior, but you're actually just a neckbeard virgin keyboard warrior
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:38:40
2 different actors.
LOTR is ian mckellen and HP is Michael gambon
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:09:18
Check his response to this. He even called me a worm lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:32:35
Blockchain, decentralizing currency. These kinds of things.
How tf are you invested if you don't know anything about it?
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:36:16
What a stupid argument. 
You might as well trust not a single company if you think about it like this
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:23:15
For the effort
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:37:28
I'd call 60% a crash
