How can I get my public key in this wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:58:06
Monero can't load in light wallet also can't make any wallet for mobile due to fundamental problem, imagine future of a coin without mobile wallet. if you are interested in privacy coin, Zcash is the best, team is working hard on codes even ethereum wants to use their researches, the negative part is 20% of mining will go to funder and team but that's not really bad if they finish the Promises.

this made my day. ha ha ha!!
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:29:26
right now there are many useless altcoins, people trading them and their value grow day after day. Usage is not the only factor of existing a coin. I believe propaganda can keep many useless coins in the game.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:56:08
b**coin cash? you need to rename it to BCASH.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:55:14
Agree. We need a more recognisable logo (at least for early years)

Thanks buddy. I always thought about such that problem, nice there is a way to solve.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:56:54
Can you make it open competition with voting system? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:08:18
When some coins are:
1- controlled by supply and demand (like ripple) 
2- have technical problem in large scale (like Bcash)
3- distributed unfair (like stellar)
4- based on ponzi scheme (like bitconnect)
5- just copy pasta of another coin (like 90% of all)

A bitcoin conference without *Andreas Antonopoulos* is worthless.

I can say 1 season: we need first time and last time a fork attack without reply protection.
Better its happen now not at 1 million dollar bitcoin.

This is another weakness of Coinbase security system which makes difficulty for users. 
Dude don't worry, I'm sure they will help you to recover your wallet after your reddit. Keep updating here ...
Anyway Don't keep your coin in middleman wallet, never forget: 
"Your private key, Your coin."
"Not your private key, Not your coin."

Actually I checked the seeds and there are 2 different seeds. I'm on iOS.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:44:00
Old story. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:34:35
I got 2 different addresses and 2 different private keys and 2 backup! what is the point to make 2 backups if there is just one public and private key? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:38:27
Just he said "My Project"?
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:21:26
Can't believe these people working for FOX Business !! embarrass   
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:37:55
did you install the app? addresses are not same.
different public keys and different private keys. you will have difficulty to recover your coin if you send them to wrong address, almost impossible for nowbies. So I call it scam wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:47:11
You should get it when you buy it, no reason to wait till 16th. looks scam.

what did not i understand about tax law? give me a way to sell bitcoin and still have opportunity to buy later. keep in mind all banks in my country will report my account balance to tax authority as soon as i receive any big amount.
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:26:50
LOL, I got that 2 months ago when i lost 30% of my bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:34:11
If I sell I have to pay tax. Tether or keep in exchanger is more risky so Hodl is the best.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:54:58
Best exchanger, I'm with bitpanda since 2015.
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:00:53

Fiat is NOT backed by armies and nukes, I would like to mention Switzerland currency, which is more powerful than North Korea or Venezuela currency which have heavy armies and nukes!!! 
Fiat is backed by our thoughts as people of a society.
