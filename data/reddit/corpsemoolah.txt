I wish I could buy one bitcoin, 210 blows my mind.

I been following for years and I bought a couple in 2014, wish I wouldn't have spent them on silk road. But these days I'm so broke I haven't had a cent to put in on top of the fact that coinbase won't verify my card

@_date: 2017-11-08 21:44:25

Yea i was going to put $200 in a week ago but I couldn't verify with coinbase cause of a bug in their end. Now I'm back to super broke anyway.
