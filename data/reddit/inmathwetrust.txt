I understand your concern. However, such is the savage nature of evolution. In natural circumstances species exploit any circumstance and unimaginable trick at their reach to survive. There are no limits to the imagination here. Nobody has the authority to tell right from wrong and nobody should. This "ugly" process makes stronger survivors and continuation of life more secure. 
Same as in nature at the end the only thing that matters is network consensus. Network consensus is the only reality.

With the high transaction fees this is bound to happen to a lot of people. Is just one of those growing pains. The "coins" are not lost. Here's what you have to do:
*1st -stop broadcasting the transaction from your node/wallet. 
*2nd-Wait! until the transaction is forgotten by the other nodes (72hrs approx) wait longer just to make sure.
*Spend the same transaction outputs again. This time include a proper fee.
The steps above are different depending on the node/wallet that you have. For example, if you use an old version of the Bitcoin QT wallet after waiting for the transaction to be forgotten by the network  you can simply go back to the last backup of your data folder. Let the node synchronize with the network and your "coins" will be there ready to be spent again. 
Here is some additional info on how to deal with this and how to calculate a proper fee respectively:

I know, I got some of his coins too. In  the long run his attacks are actually good for Bitcoin. What is not good is that we deepen the divisions between us and become weak. That is exactly what the corrupt world order would want to us to do ("divide and conquer"). 
I personally don't like what Roger is doing. But you can't deny that he has done a lot for the space. Maybe much more than a lot of us here.
