What is the history before btc? I always hear about cypher punks, but I don't really know what that business is about. Are there any cases of failed protocols like btc before btc?

People will need to pay off credit card bills after the holidays.

Sort of. If Bitcoin enabled a global currency, local govt tampering would have a small impact on Bitcoins overall value. The govt could fuck up the economy, but people's savings wouldn't lose value. But yes, your right, the Venezuelan govt could have done almost as much harm with fiat or Bitcoin.

Coinbase. But don't leave it there.

As someone who got into it at around $4400. I'll be honest, I'm starting to feel a little heat gentlemen. I'm up, sure. But that 'up' is becoming less and less 'up' by the day haha.

I just did the search. Jamie Dimon pops up first. Not sure if this post is working as intended.

Choyna. That gave me a chuckle.

I find my hands much much weaker and tremble when the market it good. When the sky was falling and it hit 3k I shrugged. Not ideal but whatever.
It hits 10k and now I'm checking my balance, second guessing my position to hold long term.
What is wrong with me?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:52:59
Even better

There is still spirit in the people. Their will isn't broken yet. 4k incoming.

Diversify with real estate, Gold(that you hold) and ETFs. Take the remaining BTC balance and diversify that into a couple other coins, maybe 5-10%.

Well, that's just plain wrong. I was alive and well when it was going on. And it wasn't feared in the same way. And looked like as a ponzi scheme as bitcoin. But it was seen as useless by a lot of people. And to be fair, it was useless. People don't have time to envision what things can do in the future, maybe. They see if things can help them now. Internet couldn't. It was a bit of a joke.
It wasnt a technology like cell phones which were exciting. Because wireless phones are an easy concept to get. It brings advanced tech and accessibility to a familiar tool. Internet didn't. In the early days it was harder to do things on the internet in most cases. It wasnt until late 90s where it gained steam. And in the 2000s where it was normalized. The early 90s it was a joke.
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:59:15
People definitely ridiculed and mocked the internet in a similar way to Bitcoin. I was around for that at least and it is almost exactly the same.
"You mean I can't be on the phone while I'm on it?"
"I can send a message that takes minutes to send, when a fax takes seconds?"
"It's made by nerds, for nerds"
"The library is free"
"Nobody is going to voluntarily sit on a computer"
"I get my news in seconds from TV, and my paper delivered every morning."
"So many hackers and predators I won't let my children use it or do any important things like banking on it."
"Takes minutes to see a picture?!"
In the beginning of consumer use of the internet it was largely a novelty thing and constantly mocked and I would say feared to a degree.

I have almost always steered the conversation with what's wrong with our financial system today. Fractional reserve banking, central banks, international payments. Bitcoin only exists as a remedy to these issues. Because most people commonly think out economy has been hijacked by big banks and corrupt government, that's a given. Just say if that's the virus, Bitcoin is the white blood cells trying to correct things. It might not be perfect, but it's trying. Bitcoin is on the team of the average person, even if they aren't a fan of it.
Then you can get into deeper stuff, but nobody wants a crypto lecture at the holidays. Just leave it at that. Sound all Nobel and altruistic. Maybe even a bit smug, like you are in on the secret, and not trying to sell snake oil. I don't know how else to deal with relatives saying "how's that Ponzi scheme going for ya". 
Luckily I am the more financially savvy one in my family. So there is a tiny bit of weight when I invest in something. Maybe. I can't imagine being a broke 21 year old kid trying to convince the older relatives how the world will run in 20 years time. That's an uphill battle. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:02:57
Yeah I wasn't trying to brag. The one guy called my financially ignorant because I dabble a few k in crypto. Just tried to say I have my priorities straight, so I listed out what others should invest into before touching crypto.
But I guess everyone who's on Reddit works as a clerk at Walmart and saying otherwise is lying?

I agree but hope your wrong. It's a piece of tech and is not set in stone. It's always changing, being worked on, and I hope it can improve to meet people's standards. That's my hope. Gotta believe!
I have a post a couple days ago, it was long so I don't want to repeat it. But someone asked if they should invest in crypto, and I think I listed out 5-6 things you should invest in first, and see crypto as more of a hobby. So I agree, it's terrifying seeing so many people convinced this will make them rich. When I see overwhelming support like that, I can't help but think btc is so over valued, that $1-10 is probably it's correct price.

Somewhere out there is a tulip farmer with a decent BTC bag, sick of these damn jokes.

Almost every source or person I heard from said it was due for a correction back in dec. "Does that mean it will get to 40k then dip and find support at 15k? Who knows. But a correct/dip is inevitable. Long term, this is going up. So as long as you can ride it out if you get unlucky and buy at ATH, you should be fine....or I'm wrong, it goes to zero. Who the fuck am I, Nostradamus?"
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:07:54
Just angry people. Understandable in this market. Stocks are down. Oils down. Looking like a recession is on the horizon on all fronts. Or at least a massive correction. Scary times. 
I mean, im losing the vote battle because I said I dabble in crypto with spare cash I can afford to lose, to a guy who thinks it's worthless and says it will go to zero...on a Bitcoin subreddit.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:32:06
Couple properties, nice nest egg with stocks and retirement savings, strong company doing well. Crypto as a hobby, yeah I'm doing alright...dick. ;)

I guess so. Seems like a good product. Wish it the best. 
@_date: 2018-11-04 12:37:07
Yeah there isnt many investments to hedge against the USD. Gold being the common sense answer. BTC being the smarter answer.
