Asking the right question.

I was being serious. As I rush out of a cab being dropped off at the airport, we're supposed to sit and wait for confirmations?

I'm surprised how many people don't understand that bitcoin is not intended to be an investment. A good investment has price volatility, within certain bounds. For example, if a stock's price is very stable over time the it's less attractive as an investment. So a good investment has predictable price changes. Now compare this to bitcoin. If it is to be used to transact business, then we absolutely don't want the market dollar value (price) o be volatile. Otherwise the bitcoin price i set today could be completely wrong tomorrow. Treating bitcoin as an investment is counterproductive, and while potentially lucrative, hurts its utility in its intended purpose. You want to support it? Easy, spend it where you can.

That car stands on a mountain of "corporations." Uber is one of the most aggressive anti-competitive corporations in the world, with an incredible market cap. The insurance company of the car and its non-bitcoin underwriters and investors, the tire company, the rubber companies, the mechanics, the parts suppliers...
This "bitcoin and uber have changed the world!" has gotten to be so over the top. Come on guys...

The issue is what happens when there isn't room in the blocks for everyone. Logically that means only a subset can contribute transactions directly to blocks. That means the system is fundamentally changed to a hierarchical system, which is not good. Off chain systems are anathema to bitcoin core principles.

Yes most US dollars only exist in computers, but an important difference with bitcoin is that those dollars are backed by the US government and law. Our bitcoins are only backed by the integrity if the protocol, the miners, your responsible use of a wallet, and the free market. No, I'm not putting 100% faith in the US govt, but 200 years of history and the strength of the US in the modern world economy do create some confidence.

Really great work. I've been surprised how few, if any, people in this sub are talking about the massive, and probably fatal, problems that have unfortunately grown in the foundations of bitcoin. But instead act like it's going to save the world.

The fed always has options. It can effectively create money, change rates, alter reserves, etc.. The US treasury can borrow money at great rates, and just print it. Congress can tax. The US has trillions of dollars in assets. If the world didn't have faith in the US dollar it wouldn't lend at such great rates. All of these facts create options. That's one of the dangers I see with Bitcoin right now. Too much power in too few hands means fewer options for the larger community.

It doesn't say that bitcoin has no value. It says it's not money, which is true.

Stamps are not "legal tender." A stamp has value, but that value depends on many factors and generally they're not fungible. One stamp may be qorth more than another. Bitcoin is a commodity. It's more like gold in that its market value rises and falls with supply and demand and is a scarce resource. 
Edit: also the idea of legal tender is based on statues that require people to accept something as a form of payment. Legally you must do so. Also the intrinsic value of the currency can be based merely on law, with fiat currencies loke the USD.

Seriously? You can buy a jug of milk at 711? You can wait for 7 confirmations to buy a pack of cigarettes?  A global power hungry race to solve blocks is not a sustainable foundation for a currency. For a commodity sure, but you need t understand how this stuff works.

They call it a crypto currency because the system is based on cryptographic algorithms like digital signatures and public private keys.

It's not money at all. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 22:32:22
Well, she's right. Bitcoin is not money. It's a commodity.
