True, but the day may only be one day. Just don't sell on that day. There is a balance and in the beginning it is hard to know what that balance is.

You could look into an OTC exchange. You buy a large amount of BTC, and then you wire them the funds. They will transfer the BTC to your account. For smaller amounts I like Kraken for wiring money.

It takes a little bit of work. I had good luck using a credit union. Practice with a small amount before you try an OTC exchange. Otherwise coinbase straight from your bank is easiest.

Yes, I was talking more about Elliottwave saying staying in dollars until the bottom.  However the government will keep printing money.  As far as gold, my opinion is that gold failed to stay decentralized by being taken over by central banks vaults.  Enter bitcoin.

If I have a limit buy order on an exchange for 1 BTC at a certain price, say 6,000. If 50 other people have the same order, what happens if there is only one BTC sold at that price? Who gets it or is it split up between everyone that had an order in? Thanks.

Experts sited were Elliottwave International and Peter Schiff.  Two doom and gloomers.  Elliottwave International had been calling for a global depression for probably over 20 years. Their subscribers have been in US dollars since than too. A broken clock is right two times a day but these guys are right about once.  They use a lot of facts in their analysis which sounds good,  but they end up being terrible at timing. Buy BTC guys. Don't listen to them when they say everything will crash except the dollar.

That is a cool shirt.

I think it will be uncorrellated with traditional markets.  However if the uncorrellation becomes acute as in a stock market crash I can see how bitcoin could get a boost as the uncorrelation is seen as a strength.

I bet if the dollar losses value, bitcoin would become more popular in relation to the value lost by the dollar making bitcoin even more valuable, so you lambo would still be in play.

At first I thought this was a short article, but it was actually a long article just so you don't miss it.

A 7 nm wall in technology is anticipated to prevent that.

I think the lions represent the king of the jungle.  Winning in bitcoin isn't necessarily about the price, it is about being disruptive and being bad ass.

Twitter banned me, so I spend time here. I don't know exactly why, so I might not go back. Censorship sucks. I find better info here anyway.

Cool. I sell a lot on ebay and would welcome this. Ebay fee 10%, Paypal around 3%. However, easy shipping labels are nice and large amount of buyers. I would be interested in btc not eth though.

I think he represents bitcoin well, in my humble opinion.  I respect his opinion.

I thought someone explained a personal story about himself buying 6.15 bitcoin and that is all he thought he needed to retire rich or something like that.

Thank you. This is the first I have heard of Redit coins.

My wife got me into crypto one year ago.  She is already starting to earn income in BTC! I wanted to sell some a couple months ago and she literally yelled at me! We saw a lambo at a car show and she said I should buy it jokingly.  If we had the money she would be game but I'm not sure if I would. Now I am totally into crypto.  Maybe one day a lambo.

Probably you need more. If you go too big you will eventually feel it and sell some. Be patient.

You don't count your house that you live in to determine if you are a millionaire.  Most millionaires are probably too busy working or vacationing or dealing with family to learn how to invest in crypto.

I'll try it.
