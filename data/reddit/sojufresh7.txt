Imagine you held bitcoin for years and now it's worth something and you have quite a bit of it. You still believe in its future and massive gains so you don't want to cash out all of it. But you still want to treat yourself to a few toys here and there. Easiest way is to have the crypto credit cards.
Same reason why there are cards to spend your gold.
