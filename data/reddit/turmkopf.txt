this is true, even my father who works at a huge tech company is one of the only ppl with btcs from around 10.000 ppl.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:14:49
maybe for the start but never ever leave your btcs on an exchange for too long

as example, my parents who never were interested in btc started to invest this year. bought in for 70k this spring and now they just ignore it for the next 8+ years

My parents invested into btcs this year. Was happy for them to make the step. (I did it already way before). My father works in a huge tech company, almost noone knows of btcs or give a shit.

A 9 year old can't comprehend what millions would do for his life so i guess it's not for that reason.
