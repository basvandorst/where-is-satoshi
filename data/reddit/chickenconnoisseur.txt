I think I am. I don't see the Settings tab, Import/Export, or Load Raw transaction in order to follow this step:
"[Offline PC] Go to Settings -&gt; Import/Export -&gt; "Load raw transaction". 
However, I am able to go to Tools -&gt; Load Transaction -&gt; From File.
At which point, I'm prompted to sign my transaction. I then sign it, input my password, and then save the transaction. However, the transaction still remains unsigned. Am I doing something wrong?

Problem solved! I deleted my wallet file, created a new wallet with my original seed, and then it worked! again, thanks for your help!

How do I check this? I haven't imported any keys into my online computer wallet. All addresses on both computers were generated by the seed.


Because it prompts me to pick a location to save my unsigned transaction. Also, when I load the transaction onto my online computer, the transaction is listed as "unsigned." 
Btw thanks for taking the time out to help me!

Thank you for the straightforward answer. What is it about using a private key once that makes it harder to find? Are you saying that every time a private key is used, there is some sort of integrity check?

I don't know. I didn't check at the time.

What is the point of backing up my blockchain.info wallet? Is it to help me out in case I lose my password? If someone were to get a hold of my backup file, could they then steal the coins from my wallet?

Any tips on how to do this on a windows PC? Is node.js a program?
