It'll do nothing. It's pointless. I'm sorry you are set to lose out.
You have been had, friend. Bitcoin is the dumbest thing I can think of aside from its retarded proponents.
Name a benefit.

Oh yeah?

What about credit cards is bad for internet use? I've never had a problem...
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:10:41
No bills are smaller than $100 unfortunately but I should helpfully tell you that bitcoin is divisible so that is just another advantage.
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:53:19
Great post. Very informative.
You have enlightened us all on the benefits of your internet moneys.

That is wonderful.

It's virtual, unless you are using a new definition of the word.

You are doing a bad job explaining. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:36:56
No I didn't intend to be mean. Just wanted to convey that you are an insane person. The "surprise ending," the not-at-all-relevant reference to Obamacare, the inexplicable smileys... it's just weird. I am truly glad to know that people like you are in the most extreme of minorities. 
I picture you as a chubby guy wearing a Guy Fawkes mask with a terrible beard underneath, and you don't yet realize that the joke is on you. 
I feel sorry for you if anything.

What feature does bitcoin have that altcoins don't have?
You guys are fucking retarded and I cant wait to watch you lose your shirt.
EDIT: I'm sure it will be someone else's fault.

**Bold text**. I am saying **words** right now.
This means **I AM RIGHT**.
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:22:19


Since when does going off the gold standard mean it's an entirely different currency? Also the goalposts have moved quite a bit from "All fiat currencies fail." The dollar has been around since 1792. No collapse.


You are doing the thing where you are saying words again. None of that is a benefit of bitcoin.


A bitcoiner telling someone else they are drinking koolaid. That is amazing.
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:42:46
Cool, man. Good luck being crazy. I'm going to head off to bed, because I have a job. You keep fighting the bad fight.


I couldn't resist this one. Your money is not real money. Have fun buying overstock crap and pizza. Can't forget about the major necessity that is tarot cards. lol
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:11:37
Lol look at all the weirdos who will comment immediately to get something that is retarded.

Good job with the spam.
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:16:32
You didn't read it, but you are saying words about it?

You are clearly retarded. Good luck.

So we can believe that part but everything else is bullshit?

You are advertising for yourself. It's spam. Read the rules.
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:26:03


Oh, that's THE reason why?Based on what? Could you expand?


Well, how about the U.S. Dollar? But really there are plenty more forms of real money that have. The dollar first one I thought of because it's the one I am most familiar with. I's been around since the 18th century. There are currencies that have been around longer, I'd imagine. It's not even worth looking in to, really. Dumb question on your part.


You are just saying words. There is nothing of substance here to back your original claim.
I don't see a single benefit that bitcoin offers that isn't either (1) matched by current money, (2) beaten in the same category by money, or (3) beaten in a different category that outweighs the original.


If that is what you believe then you clearly have a poor grasp on economics.

No, they won't. There are many more normal people filing than bitcoin people, and there are many more complicated filings than the ones we are talking about. A stack of paper doesn't matter to the IRS.
Besides, they aren't physically reading every page. By all means, waste your time if it makes you feel better, but it is doing nothing. They don't care.

Virtual gold... I like it.
@_date: 2014-02-19 02:55:31
Your answer is vague. Why do all "fiat" currencies collapse, and how are you so sure of this fact? Further, what feature distinguishes bitcoin from dollars in that dollars will collapse when bitcoin will not? 
The dollar is not backed by gold any longer for very good reasons. That's another debate.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:30:42
Bunch of weirdos if you ask me.
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:15:59
Why was trading halted? Why are employees not being paid?
That statement answered no relevant questions.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:36:34
Why would the dollar not exist?
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:40:21
Fair enough. I've never tried to ignore anyone so I wouldn't know if it didn't work. RES can be buggy at times for sure.
Thanks for the reply. Upvoting them is always a good bet!
@_date: 2014-02-17 05:20:25
Agreed. This thing is a scam its good for people to have parents that teach them not to be scammed or ripped off.
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:48:19
Will do. Make sure to clean your room, or your parents might get mad.

A bitcoin can be spent over and over, just like the dollar I just bought a beer with. Once an apple is eaten, it's gone. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:09:06
That's an apples to oranges ( or bitcoins in this case) comparison. Apples are consumed. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 05:35:48


Lol buddy sure you are.

Better yet what advantage do cryptocurrencies in general have over real money?
I insist.
