@_date: 2015-06-21 02:22:54
No... it is not disingenuous... it is the only viable information available.
The government has choked all the USD/VEF rate providers beside the government run ones, so there's little to no way to establish parity on that pair. However, the only remaining exchange that is somewhat usable is the one on the colombo-venezuelan frontier, because colombians are the only interested parties on buying VEF (for trading drugs and gasoline, mainly).
If you're one provider that publishes exchange rates on internet of USD/VEF you could get between 5-10 years of hard time. Those guys have steel balls to publish that info.
Also, BTC/USD rate from coindesk is relatively good, and the only available USD/VEF rate is the one on dolartoday.com.
About the $19.000 price tag, yeah.... liquidity is bad... i wish there was some more people interested on the BTC/VEF pair, but trader don't have use for a rapidly devaluating coin.... why else would you buy VEF if not for your "loved" ones in the country.
EDIT: BTW 116000 VEF/BTC atm
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:17:27
Yeah, as a matter of fact, price has remained more or less stable as liquidity is increasing... Currently on my country, BTC price gets horribly affected if you buy or sell more than 5 btc heh!

No... that's a common misconception: President of the board isn't the same as CEO. The CEO is an employee position, where there's a work dependency, and you report to the board of directors.
President of the board is an ad-honorem position within the board of a company, where you interact with the CEO and other companies to do business on a macro scale.

As a Venezuelan, the capital control laws are one of the worst evils you can get.
Not only it makes the country's currency irrelevant outside its limits, but it creates scarcity by demand: having goods is way more intelligent than having cash, and all the cash a family gets will be converted asap to food, cars, computers, etc. you get the idea.
So, aside from limiting imports through a capital control, you overvalue your own currency and in change make rampant scarcity an issue.
The only way to solve this to let external investors inject capital with some tax reliefs and remove contrl of the economy from the incompetent government.

Of course i know... but 1 satoshi isn't meaningful out there... lemme explain myself:
I just had a meal with a low quality hamburguer and a soda, it cost me 340 VEF, which would be around 0.0036 BTC. However, 340 VEF is about 5% of a whole month minimum wage here on my country. Now, imagine you barely earn 0.074 BTC/Month (which is the minimum wage here), and you're asked to buy a thingamagig on internet that costs you 0.01 BTC, you would think it twice ("should i spend on this stupid thing or should i save for a nice meal?" is the question most people here on my country would ask).
That's the price barrier that i'm talking about: Bitcoin is a tech that only the 1%ers on venezuela can get into with meaningful numbers, the rest are just not able to invest in such a meaningful way that it would change their quality of living. Coincidentally, those 1%ers could move their money through other means that have FAR more liquidity than Bitcoin atm here. Look at order book of the only exchange operating on our country  and you will understand why price is a concern.
EDIT: Btw, 10 Sats (the amount you casually wrote there) is 1 liter of Gasoline here. What would you buy? one liter of gasoline or 10 sats?

The fact that it is a "Bug Tracking Software" and not a "Forum" makes it more irrational. I guess they won't be too happy to receive 8 + the next waves of irrational-hate-charged emails because they decided not to include a payment option.
Don't get me wrong, i need to pay GAE services with Bitcoin more than most people commenting there, and you don't see me with the same level of zealousness posting on a bug tracker. I can come here and downvote/upvote with all my rage and create hateful posts with lots of arguments, but it is of no use to post this kind of drama on a bug tracker.
Just picture this same event with git pull requests on the Bitcoin repo. It would be crazy to include hateful comments if the devs rejected the pull request, because developing software is all except including unnecessary emotion.

So, after 2 or 3 rounds, everyone was asking who was this guy that was always the first (none of them knew i was playing) and i changed my then nickname "Predator" to "Chiguireitor" (which in spanish is pronounced like you would pronounce Chiguirator) so people would laugh at my nick and then get humiliated by this funny character.

I don't want anyone to act a certain way. I'm just suggesting, from what i've learnt in the few months i've been interacting with the sub (knew bitcoin several years ago, only began interacting with recently) that we should immediately stop being childish when asking service and good providers acceptance of our payment method, because for them it is just that, a payment method.
And i DO focus on my actions and consequences, that's why as a software developer i came here to ask for help (and it did work, never before an issue started by me has had so much attention on Google App Engine) and, although Google's decision wasn't the best, we got a response.
Anyways, time to move on, Google App Engine: nay, Microsoft Azure: yay? Dunno if that service can be paid *yet* with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:54:52
I don't want you to stop asking. I just want people to stop losing their shit when a service/goods provider reject accepting bitcoin. I know on G+ some of these guys, and they're pretty cool.

Although the question is probably well intentioned, there's nothing foreigners can do to help our country, besides offering goods and services that can be paid on Bitcoin.
**First some background**
When i was a kiddo, i remember buying things on internet was pretty straightforward. Once my dad and i bought a "Professional" license for Delphi 5 (you can begin deducing i'm no kiddo now ;) so we could develop legally our software, btw, the one that keeps my family well fed. However, since the Chavez administration instaurated the foreign exchange control, things have been downhill since that moment. First, we started with an anual quota of 3000 USD/year, which was reduced some years ago to 400 USD/year, and last year reduced to 300 USD/year on credit card expenditures. Now, picture yourself with only $300 a year on the internet and you can begin to understand why on my country piracy, counterfeits and rejected/fleeing foreign businesses are so flagrant. To add insult over injury, the electronic quota can only be spent with credit cards, with an APR of 27%, and only given to a select few (less than 10% of the population has access to credit cards).
This year, the Maduro administration was so dumb as to add further restrictions: only credit cards from state owned banks can be used to spend foreign currency (these banks account for less than 10% of the current credit card holders, myself NOT included) and they tried (but failed, fortunately) to restrict the 300 USD/year to 100 USD/4months.
These policies have put a HUGE pressure on the black market, which started year 2014 at around 70 VEF/USD and later skyrocketed to ~400 VEF/USD. However, this isn't the whole story: The current (and only) black market indicator is the one owned by DolarToday, which has been target of several state run attacks, and has been blocked countless times by the main internet domain name solver (that is, coincidentally, state run); being the sole market indicator is a huge problem, because no one wants to publish this kind of information (you could get between 6 to 10 years of hard time), and DolarToday only uses the exchange information from the Cucuta/Venezuela country border, which is heavily distorted by a) Colombian people fleeing the country because the state xenophobia for their kind; b) obvious whales are obvious; c) state run cartels.
There's a sore need for a better market indicator, but no-one is going to risk their necks with that.
**How can YOU help?**
Vote with your wallet, use services that accept bitcoin/litecoin/any other crypto first and foremost. If you have the option to pay with USD or BTC, use the latter. Never, ever let the bright flame of innovation wane out of existence due to lazyness. Bitcoin has a thriving community on Venezuela, and we're trying to do the right thing, teaching, starting businesses that accept/use BTC.
TL;DR: Help us helping yourselves, the rest will follow suit.

If he's planning on putting the bitcoin to work for him, then yes! there are a lot of ways he can get a lot of money from intelligent investments (think lending on BTCJam or BitcoinLendingClub) using bitcoin, which is way a lot better than lending cash the old way.

**Current environment**: Some high level government officials are knee-deep into bitcoin. Namely, one of them (Guido Ochoa &amp; son), bought Hashfast and is reportedly establishing a ~3 PH/s farm. Yeah, ~3 PH/s. Electricity is dirt cheap here, i pay (on one of the most expensive zones of my country) 0.002 USD/KWh.
**Awareness**: Near zero. I have some friends with several businesses, and they know zilch about bitcoin. Low stratum classes are completely oblivious about bitcoin, generally speaking, and middle class is slowly getting to know it. Businesses have 0 confidence in bitcoin because its usage would risk its ban as it already happened on Ecuador.
**Perception**: Bitcoin ~~ Gold, at least here. Trading bitcoin is almost as trading a high valued and secure commodity, when you compare it with trading USD (highly illegal) or holding VEF (with almost 3 digit YoY inflation, plain stupid).
**BTC accesibility**: 1 BTC == 1 year of minimum wage. Very costly to get them, at least in monetary terms, but the trading "scene" is thriving. We have one established exchange which is nice and realiable, localbitcoins trades are commonplace, and there's one facebook group full of trading and selling with bitcoin.
Regarding your perception of bitcoin as a sinking ship, that's only a first world problem. Here on Venezuela bitcoin seems like the go-to to store one's wealth, as crazy as it sounds, because VEF's value is diminishing fast.
TL;DR: Although it is currently a tech that only the 1% of the 1% knows, it is rapidly gaining traction here on Venezuela.

The Bitcoin community is thriving on our country, there's a vibrant mining scene and P2P lending to Venezuelans is the best since sliced bread (as we have nearly 0 ways to have meaningful lending from banks to most individuals).
Also, electricity cost is almost free (almost) and a little north from 80% is Hydro, with a new 12 GW plant coming online in the next months to reach more than 90% Hydro power on our country.

The failure in your calculations are:
* Capital controls go further in the economy than the pegging of foreign exchange. Price controls, internal economic subsidies, etc. This has the macroeconomic effect of lowering the "on-paper" inflation, but creates a huge dissonance between measurable inflation and perceived inflation.
* Official market is non-existent. Really. The latest joke from the government was SIMADI, and you can only get at most $300 once a month, if they government wants to spare some dollars.
* VEF Devaluation was rather steep. And it wasn't slow, it was abrupt. One day it cost 150 VEF each USD, then next week 250 VEF. Then two weeks later 450 VEF. That's a 300% devaluation. If you bought 1 USD worth of BTC at $300 and lost 16% you would be left with 0.84 USD, however, at that time, 1 USD went from 150 to 450 VEF. You would be left with 378 VEF, a nominal earning of 252%. However, i bought a lot on the low 200s.
As you can see, VEF holdings went up rather steeply, while USD lowered a tiny bit.
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:17:29
Chill out man....
I buy all my food with the VEF i earn monthly... That VEF can also cover car expenses (dirty cheap here, i fill the gas tank with .8 USD cents). Services are also dirty cheap (i spend like, what? 10 USD monthly on services? that's all).
Apart from food, car expenses and services, there's nothing else to do in this shithole... so no sense on holding VEF anymore... Wham! BTC.

Welp, i have a new mining farm, i'm up 16 miners, doing some projects for further expansion... all in all, doing pretty well.
Also, i'm looking to buy a truck (all those miners need to be hauled somehow) and moving to a better housing next year, if all goes up to plan.
I've diversified a little my savings using Bitreserve's service, which now i include Silver, Gold, Palladium and Platinum. Still not much into fiat, i really loathe fiat.
Last time i got some nice tips with Changetip's services, and went and bought games on IndieGameStand (they accept Bitcoin btw).
Also, began participating into 's project of creating a decentralized social network (DATT, from decentralize all the things).
**A handful of awesome.**
Regarding my country, ooh my... what a disaster: queues are even worse now, people die and starve, all shitty around here :( The social differences are aggravating at an extremely fast pace, and there's no turning back from hyperinflation. I only exchange to VEF whatever i have to use, nothing else as the currency is losing value REALLY fast.
@_date: 2015-07-02 16:38:11
Holding USD outside the government sanctioned accounts, that don't have direct ways to use the funds, that need a $40 fee for SWIFT transfers, and are ULTRA slow is the **ONLY** legal way to have USD in Venezuela. Bitcoin is not illegal. In fact, the idea of Bitcoin allures a lot of government officials because it feels like a way to circumvent USD dominance.
However, you're using a wrong frame of reference in your argument. Hyperinflation changes everything in matter of days or weeks, not months. If i buy 1 BTC today for 126 VEF almost surely next three or four days it will be 132 VEF worth. That would mean, if i store 126k VEF on Bitcoin, i can gain one minimum wage in about 3-4 days... just HOLDING... nothing else to do.

@_date: 2015-07-03 10:28:53
Mining in the US isn't that profitable, unless it is winter, then you can use the miners as heat sources that pay themselves. The maximum rate for electricity where an Antminer S5 stops being profitable is $0.12/KWh, so if you're notably below that, you can mine for a profit. Each S5 will output around $88/month in ideal conditions (good internet connection, stable ambient temp around 30ºC).
@_date: 2015-07-02 15:30:35
The tripling was in a matter of weeks, not years... bought in Bitcoin when black market exchange was 150 VEF/USD, now we're a little north of 450 VEF/USD, with almost the same Bitcoin price (if not a little more valuable).
EDIT: And when bitcoin was high valued, i was just buying miners :D
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:26:49
Ok... i use bitcoin for:
* Games on IndieGameStand.com.
* Buying moar miners.
* Gift cards for amazon.
* Buy stuff from newegg and tigerdirect.
* Exchanging it for VEF to go and buy expensive sushi, maybe once or twice a month.
* Pay some VPS services for many businesses i do.
* Pay some Domain names i have, yearly.
Asides from that, as long as there's netflix at home and food, i don't go out or do anything else, really. We're kinda average family in that respect.
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:20:50
Aparte de tener seguro: conozco suficientes personas para intercambiar Bitcoin por VEF en minutos y viceversa. También están los sitios de intercambio de Bitcoin Surbitcoin y Bitinka (que sorprendentemente también opera en vzla).

Heh... In a country where "taking place in a queue all day to buy regulated goods" is a job (a very good paid one btw, almost twice minimum wage), being at home hearing whirry noises from your miner and getting semi-rich isn't half bad a scenario.

Is as pronounced as the Englishes, and then a little more...
For example, on Spain a "Pajilla" is a straw... on Venezuela is "a quicky masturbation", conversely, "Pitillo" is a straw on Venezuela, and a "quicky masturbation" on spain... go figure.
On Venezuela a "cachucha" is a baseball hat, on Argentina is a popular world for "vagina".
And the list goes on... dialects are VERY different, and accents are also ultra different... i recognize almost instantly by their accent someone from each latin country.
Also, Spaniards have totally different accents and dialects that makes it really obvious from what province where are they from. Same with Venezuelans and Colombians.
In Venezuela, there are sub-dialects to boot... there is the "Gocho" dialect that has a lot of archaic words from the aboriginal population.
The diversity is as beautiful as it happens in English. And also, it bothers a lot when you spot it.

Aside from the local knowers club (a facebook group, and some people that deal with btc). No.
My business would readily take BTC for my software, but i doubt Time &amp; Attendance management with biometric data is awfully popular on the venezuelan bitcoin community.
@_date: 2015-07-02 11:31:55
Venezuelan here.
My country has had capital controls since 2002. Buying outside our country is a nightmare. You can get prosecuted for simple things like buying gift cards with penalties such as removing FOR LIFE your annual quota of a paltry $300 on credit cards. You can't use any other means to buy goods or pay services besides credit cards. The dollar has been pegged to a crazy 6.3 VEF/USD since some years ago (up from another crazier 4.3 VEF/USD).
Since half a year ago, i've kept **ALL MY WEALTH** in Bitcoin... yes **ALL**. Every single VEF i get, after buying food, gets converted to Bitcoin immediatly.
Not Dollars.
Not Euros.
Not GBP.
I have almost **triplicated my wealth since i made that move**. When the black market exchange rate was 150 VEF/USD, i held Bitcoin. Some weeks ago the black market exchange went to ~450 VEF/USD. Guess what, i feel like a rich man. I can maintain my WHOLE FAMILY OF 5 (food, basic services, debt) with just .3 BTC/month. The rest gets stashed away.
Also, i began mining. 1 Antminer S5 gives me, after electricity costs (which are almost non-existent, electricity cost here is a joke) the same wage my wife and i earn (we're both engineers) **TWICE a month**.
Your government will do stupid things, i guarantee it. Don't trust a single drachma/euro to them. If you want to hedge, use something like Bitreserve, but believe me, wild price swings aren't that important dealing with Bitcoin when your other alternative is a highly manipulable, fractional-reserve backed, fiat money.
If you want more specifics, pm me.
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:19:10
Welp, for example, the regulated price 1/4kg of coffee is about 67 VEF (0.000536 BTC) and people are willing to pay up to 300 VEF for each one (0.0024 BTC), that's a 4.47x markup.
Same with sugar, diapers, flour, toothpaste, toilet paper, tuna, detergent, dish soap, etc.
There are around 20-50 products that see constant shortages because they are regulated, and manufacturers must sell at a loss due to government regulations.
These products you can only buy with the last number of your national id: 1-2 buy monday, 3-4 tuesday, 5-6 wednesday, 7-8 thursday and 9-0 friday. Saturday 1-5 and Sunday 6-0.
Most supermarket chains get goods monday, and by tuesday are empty. So people with national IDs ending on 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 0 are fucked up. You get the remnants of the undesirable goods.
People with the luck of having national IDs ending on 1, 2, 3 and 4 get paid by people with a little more money than them to queue all day and buy the limited products from these supermarkets. These products get sold at street, on a p2p black market, at 4-6 times the regulated price (which, ironically, is almost the same price outside our country at black market dollars, coincidence?)
These poor people, that would be working minimum wage jobs do 1.5-1.8x that wage just from doing queues 1 day a week all the effing day. When finished buying on a supermarket, they go to another, and so on....
So there you go.... fucked up venezuelan economics in a nugget.


Welp, before the huge mega devaluation i earned something like 400-600 usd a month (that was almost 10 times minimum wage here, we have almost 100 times lower cost of living than USA). However, after devaluation, a **GOOD** wage is around $50/month... not very optimal...
As an example... a good meal with me, wife, and 3 kids, with 3 dishes at a sushi restaurant, the wife and i drinking expensive beer, would be about $15. So yeah... pretty cheap everything here.
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:48:47
Yeah, capital controls are one of the most violent agressions a government can do over its population.
Fortunately, having bitcoin around only makes things easier.

Good thing with XCP is that if a PR move re-emits a locked asset with a new name, people can confirm the original asset when someone sells it and that will only increase the rarenes (ahem... pepe....) of the previous asset, hence, raising its value.
XCP is amazing... can't wait to see what other things people implement over it.

Problem isn't the BTC-&gt;merchant side, most merchants would probably be willing to accept direct BTC payments.

No, it has been always like that. Even before this "socialist" revolution.
80% of the power here comes from a pretty bad ass power dam, which was at a time the 2nd greatest in the world.

USD here is illegal. Bitcoin not. Also, i'm a software engineer with a specialization in cryptography, so yeah.... i like cryptocurrencies.


It's as simple as having BTC and cashing out in 0.025-0.05 increments whenever i run out of money. (just to point it out, 0.025 btc is 10 months worth of minimum salary, the salary 80% of the population gets).

A fair amount "knows" bitcoin and "knows" that it has USD equivalency. If you're venezuelan and haven't heard about bitcoin, then you're pretty much on the VERY low strates of society. OTOH, there's fairly non-tech people that know they can use Btc to buy on amazon through purse or buying giftcards. My grans does it through my aunt, she just tells her "buy me shoes with bitcoin on amazon" and then somehow she sees her brand new shoes arriving. Most non-tech ppl get aided by either a family member or friend for this.


Definitively everyone is interested. Peeps know that bitcoin == $$$ so they are on the lookout of how to get in. Most won't do a google search, but they pretty much would do anything to get a grasp of what all this "bitcoin madness" is.
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:22:30

It's not illegal, that's a pretty bad assumption. There have been at least 3 mentions from high government officials regarding bitcoin as a better alternative to empire-money (their words, not mine, i don't support them).
SEBIN just extorts and kidnaps high earning business owners and bitcoin miners the same.
People haven't been arrested btw, they have been detained and most if not all put out after the 3 month moratory on judge declaration. Their miners stolen of course. An arrest is a legal procedure, whereas all that has happened until now has been illegal detentions for inquires.
Yeah, SEBIN loves to create the halo of illegality on their blackmailed/kidnapped/extorted victims because that sort of clears their mind of sins. This is not normal. THIS IS ENOUGH TO HAVE 10-20 YEARS OF PRISON IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY FOR THOSE OFFICIALS, and this got to stop here. **Mining is not illegal by any law here on our country**, it's just Douglas Rico's goons and Gustavo González López's doing power plays over badly informed entrepreneurs.
And yeah, btc is easier to use than any USD bank account.

Yes, we need to remove monetary policy from our government urgently because they are really bad at public administration (even previous non-socialist govs).


Nope. Mostly millenials and upwards. I have several family members that use them, but they are fairly tech-oriented.


In the capital, yes. Countryside nope. Pretty bad cell coverage and general crime makes it impossible to have a good phone for long.


Lower fees (just paid $2.5 fee on a TX today, that's like 15 days salary here). Also, cheaper and easier to use hardware wallets. We're talking $2-$3 range here.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:19:36
When you're paying on bitpay you need fairly high fees to prevent their stupid system from generating trouble.
For anything else i've been using ridiculously low fees. But for a common venezuelan $0.03 is 2 hours of work, so still expensive.

I come from the low class (as in, living on impoverished houses), but high standard education is free here, you just gotta study hard (which i did). I went from nothing to pretty much the 0.1% segment here in 9 years working on software and bitcoin-related stuff. Most of the crypto community is middle class... upper class want nothing to do with bitcoin, they are already comfortable where they are.
Bitcoin awareness here is becoming fast a strange phenomena, but still counting people active on the community in the thousands.

Exchange rate is the usual dark market rate of USD on finex or bitstamp.
$100 USD here and you can live like a king for a month (almost 9 moths of minimum salary here).

Localbitcoins accepts neogas?

It's a common term in bitcoin.... Yah, it's a misnomer, but one used widely.... you'll see lots of ppl around these parts say (purposely) HODL instead of HOLD

Yeppers.... My nonna, my aunt, my mom/dad, my brothers and sister, my brother-in-law, they are all in.... heck! even my girls i pay them their "A" grades on a BTC wallet they have in their phones.
All my employees earn a bit of bitcoin too, i made a fundraiser for a game we're developing and i like to spread the BTC love.
I have no friends outside crypto here, so pretty much everyone around me gets into crypto somehow or get out of my social circle XD.

Welcome to the world buddy, it existed way before you were born, not everyone is a youngling like you.

Most people aren't too happy accepting it because it adds an additional layer of complication to their process. I only have succeeded with one courier I use to bring stuff from Amazon to my door.

Pretty low. USERS are scarce and far between. Hodlers and miners are the most common ones. Most peeps just mine and dump. Some are starting to work for crypto here. Since when i started using BTC (2011) i have never been able to pay anything in BTC here besides my inner friends/family circle.


There were some "bachaqueros" accepting it but the extortion/blackmailing on crypto by the local police forces has been harsh. It isn't illegal per-se to use it, just a gray area that gets filled in by corrupt officials stealing your hard earned money.


There's a lot of people arbitraging here, so this could get muddled by those numbers. You could say that by each 10 ppl that sells USD there's 1 doing BTC too.

I'm thinking on creating a simple site where people can register and get some help with some manual curation and verification, this has sparked an idea that just may work.

I'm ok with that... know a lot of ppl are more listeners than readers.... i particularly prefer to read this kind of stuff

Maybe this December when I get a little "free" time

This question pains me....
I saw the original satoshi email pasted on a forum thread way before 2011.... disregarded it as just fintech nonsense. Then on 2011 began mining and got me some btc, deposited it in MtGox and forgot about it. FF 2013, what i left as cents on MtGox was now about $100. Went crazy/enraged immediatly and never left again hehehehe.
The crypto community is gaining momentum here... in fact i'm intending to help organize some meetups in the future.

As the mod of can confirm this is NOT happening, i have been all day using these services with several different uplinks.
It just happens that the CANTV (main venezuelan ISP) DNS servers are really shitty and they have been misbehaving all day.
Nothing else.

For a price, via .onion though :D

I recommend you take a look at counterparty and it's use cases inside the blockchain (the best blockchain there is, btc).
Also, don't judge without experiencing it first hand, it's a common misconception that we're in for the money... We're not, we just in for the fun and the lambos.

I know the saying... but just to clarify, this "dilemma" isn't a dilemma at all: by a simple application of the evolution theory, you know that it first was an animal that wasn't a chicken, that laid an egg, that had a mutated specimen, which after enough iterations of the mutation through generations, resulted in a chicken being born.
Thus, it was first the egg, then the chicken.
