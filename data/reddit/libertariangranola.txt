Some companies like Circle and Coinbase allow you to buy bitcoin with a credit card. It's up to you to decide whether you trust them with this info.

The premise that CP being sold is a problem is subjective. One could argue that if CP were more freely available, it would a) limit the urges of paedophiles to actually act out their fantasies in the real world and b) tank the market for CP. Instead CP is treated as a forbidden fruit like illegal drugs and thus a market has sprung up to provide such content at very lucrative prices, sickeningly incentivising paedos to act in the real world where surveillance is minimal rather than risk being caught on the internet where surveillance is ubiquitous.

You could go [fiat currency] --&gt; [some widely accepted commodity, like gold] --&gt; bitcoin if you want to be really sly about it. But you're right, at some point, the fiat currency will be considered worthless and no one will accept it in exchange for anything. The people still holding it at that point are referred to as "bag holders."

Bitcoin cannot execute arbitrarily complex scripts in a trustless fashion. Anything built "on top" which can do this will be necessarily centralized in some way eg [Codius](

I wouldn't be too quick to say that - if you're an American citizen, you've got over [$1 million]( worth of debt to your name that you never asked for which you are forced to pay for through direct taxation and the inflation tax.

Two problems: 
1. Vulnerable to a bank run (the Fed and FDIC purport to protect against this)
2. Monetary musical chairs game, creating money out of thin air and charging interest on that made-up money thus ensuring that more money is always owed than actually exists.

Not sure it's the "payment processor" part of Coinbase that OP is against. They also broker sales and maintain custody of customers' (merchants and consumers alike) private keys.

the pricing complications, not to mention the complications with refunds if campaigns don't hit their targets, make this idea a non-starter. Lighthouse is the only way to go for bitcoin crowdfunding.
P.S. $100 BTC - this is actually good news!

lol "feeless" we'll see how "feeless" Bitcoin is after the mining subsidy disappears/ diminishes to the point of irrelevancy. Even today you're lucky to get a transaction with no fees into a block within 24 hours, if at all.

I think the OP is saying WE only have 45 days to review the proposed regulations and write and submit the comments.

I've read that releasing software with an MIT license is basically coding for corporations for free since they can incorporate the code in proprietary software. GPL / copyleft licenses make it so that any project that incorporates the code has to also be open source, which would be a better outcome, no?

I do not think was calling all anarchists extremists. They appear to have been saying that there are extremists who happen to be anarchists that are vehement advocates of decentralization at any cost.

They're raising money to fund the development of a cryptocurrency system that enables the decentralized, trustless execution of arbitrarily complex "smart contracts." In exchange for your financial contribution, you receive a promise that you will receive a corresponding amount of tokens which allow you to use the system once that system is released to the public. These tokens may or may not be worth more than the price you paid for them in the future.

Thank you for taking the time to do this! I'm not too up-to-date on the technical specs. I have a few questions:
* How do nodes find and talk to each other?
* Where is the data being stored and how is it communicated to other nodes? ie how is my client publishing a reputation rating, listing description, pictures, etc and how are other clients turning that data into a nice UI?
* Is there encrypted messaging at all? If so, how are keys being exchanged to prevent MiTM attacks?
* Is there any concept of "identity lifecycle" with key revocation and cycling built in?
* Is there a concept of filtering to weed out spam/ DDoS?
* Similarly, any thoughts on how to deal with sockpuppets?
* Is Dark Wallet going to be used for payments?
Ok more than a few questions, I'll stop fillibustering now I'm just really excited about this and haven't had time to dive too deep into it :)

CP has more to do with psychopathy than people's resource needs not being met. Perhaps at the root of some cases there is an abusive parent that grew up poor and stupid and takes it out on their kid who grows up to be a CP addict but I'm not sure an RBE can solve all mental health issues. Your point is ultimately correct though in that a decentralized marketplace won't be able to solve any social problems; all it can do is to make it easier for buyers and sellers to connect.

OpenTransactions + Bitcoin could be helpful. OT uses triple-entry accounting to keep track of off-chain balances, and final settlement occurs on the block chain. And something tells me that quantum mechanics has a role to play in interstellar Bitcoin transactions as well, I'm just not smart enough to know how (it's the thought that counts)
@_date: 2014-08-05 02:24:11
AFAIK you don't need a bank account to use the cards you mentioned.
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:30:45
does not mean that those other cards would have approved them. card companies are EXTREMELY picky about who they work with. I'm sure Xapo talked to all of them and upon saying the word "bitcoin" heard nothing but crickets in return.

I've been buying twice as many bitcoins as I plan to spend, saving half and spending the other. I inevitably end up dipping into my savings a bit but am sure to replenish during my next purchase. I think this evens out my "Bitcoin savings karma" and it seems like a winning strategy to me. What say you, Redditors? 
@_date: 2012-12-07 02:24:43
I'll be there, looking forward to meeting people from the community!

I'll second groceries, plus self-defense/hunting products like guns, knives, bows, ammo + accessories etc, and self-sufficiency gear like solar panels and gardening supplies. If I can pay for food, energy, and security with Bitcoin, I'm set!

Bitcoin doesn't need more laws, it needs less. Any lobbying done on behalf of Bitcoin should be to repeal laws, not add new ones to the books.

Helping criminals fund their criminal empire is not being a "better person." Defining our terms here, "Governments derive their *just* powers from the consent of the governed" (paraphrased from the Declaration of Independence) - when have you ever been asked for your consent? Sure, government is needed: to the extent that all who are governed consent to all of the regulations being imposed on them and services provided to them (just like with any other business). But the entity which claims to "govern" is not a government, it is a criminal racket which extorts the population to fund the expansion of its empire. I can understand if you want to pay the extortion money and avoid being hurt. But anyone who finds this activity productive or even necessary "for the good of society" clearly drank too much of the kool-aid in grade school.

I'm guessing the only people being busted are people who didn't use PGP or were set up by their "vendor" aka a cop. If PGP were used, their names / addresses would not be readable on the database.
