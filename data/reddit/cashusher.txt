That's just nonsense. Are Bitcoin-funded debit card transactions also "Bitcoin transactions"?  


I'm going to "a hubcap, while having the potential for becoming a part of a car, is not, in itself, a car." You know what a hubcap is, right?
If I open a payment channel, make 200 LN transactions, and close the payment channel, which of the 200 LN transactions (car parts) would be (one of the two actual) Bitcoin transactions (cars)?

Our disagreement might stem from something trivial, like different interpretations of the word "dictate" To me, "dictate" means ability to lay down the terms, leaving the object *no choice* but to obey. Think dictator: "Do X, or no Y." This works for both the seller and the buyer (seller: Give me 1 BTC, or no product; Buyer: No sale, unless I pay with PP). So both can "dictate" the terms. How do you interpret "dictate"?
@_date: 2016-11-02 13:33:43


That "confirmation number" is the (Bitcoin) blockchain. Unless the customer is doing something nefarious (as in "trying to doublespend that transaction"), that's all that's required. 
Unless you're telling me that Bitcoin doesn't work.


The same customer would have to wait forever for a PP transactions, those could be reversed. Thus becoming *unconfirmed transactions on which you owe $20 chargeback fee*.

Also not how LN transactions work, what's your point? The only transactions that show up on Bitcoin blockchain are: 
1. Payment channel opened &amp; funded with Bitcoin
2. Payment channel closed
The rest exist only on LN. Just like all the bitcoin debit card transactions.


Ah, i see. A transaction in thought is a transaction in deed. Potential of becoming a Bitcoin transaction is not much different from an actual, broadcast Bitcoin transaction. I can just write it down on a slip of paper and ~ Poof! ~ I transacted in Bitcoin. 
In that case, today's Bitcoin network can handle more transactions than Visa. True, only ~3 transactions per second could actually be confirmed, but we can create as many transactions as we please.  Why are we bothering with scaling again?

The word "used" means "to be used," not "has been used," as you seem to read it. So yes, even before lumber has been used in the building trade, it is still lumber. Earthling language is not merely context-overloaded, but common sense overloaded.


Lumber is used in the building trade. This doe not imply that you can't burn it (i.e. use lumber as firewood), make shitty furniture out of it, or cook it up and shoot it. Because A=B does not imply that A != C.

It is. Dealing in Lightning payment channel transactions is the first step. Analogous to the one taken when people stopped dealing in gold, and started doing business in convenient gold-backed paper -- in IOUs. 
Today, in the USD, this IOU paper is valuable in itself, without reliance on, or even reference to, gold. It took time, but here we are.
And goldbugs raging about the USD no longer being backed by gold simply sound absurd, so not sure what you mean by "much harder to audit that things were all above board," there's no slight-of-hand, literally nothing to audit, everything happened out in the open, in daylight. Do you feel the FED is lying about the USD no longer being backed by gold? I assure you, it is not. All done in plain sight, so...
Edit: you're a coder, so think coding in x86 assembler (Bitcoin). It's tedious, someone writes a C compiler (LN), you start coding in C. And suddenly the x86 chip isn't so important. Something like that.

That's why the sellers also cater to the buyer, always. That's why stores accept returns, no questions asked. Because if they don't, and their competitor does, guess where the client is gonna shop? And that's why brick &amp; mortar stores operate in high-traffic, high-rent locations. Because the customer won't come to them in East Armpit, Nowhere.
But this goes only so far, Stores cut prices below their competitors &amp; accommodate their buyers, until they can't make a profit, and then they stop. Nothing unique about the interweb. eBay and PP have earned their customer's trust, and that's why people shop eBay and use PayPal, or Craigslist and cash. But not OB &amp; Freddy the mediator.

LN transactions are not well-formed Bitcoin transactions. Broadcasting them on the Bitcoin network would be pointless -- they'll be rejected. For the very same reason that an MP3 file or a giant pangolin would be rejected: they're not Bitcoin transactions. They don't even look like Bitcoin transactions. Seems self-evident to me.
That's what makes LN useful -- LN transactions are LN transactions and not Bitcoin transactions, because they happen off-chain, i.e. "not on the Bitcoin blockchain."

Not necessarily a good analogy. Imagine if Bus took up as much road space, per person, as Econobox. That's pretty much what happens -- the blockchain would grow by the same number of bites, per tx, regardless of blocksize.
Right now, the blockchain can grow by ~1MB every ~10 minutes, maximum. If we had no blocksize limit, it could grow by (infinity)MB every ~10 minutes, maximum. It's pretty unlikely to happen, because even the current 1MB blocks are not constantly full now, but that's what small blockers are trying to avoid.

No. Miners are currently competing for the block reward, 12.5 bitcoins. 
Soon(ish, when there are no more block rewards) they'll be competing to sell you some space in a block they solve. This may mean having to include *no* transactions in a solved block. Miners have often mined empty blocks, when mempool was full of waiting, non-zero-fee transactions.

It's all what you mean by "expected." If those transactions are real, i.e. money that *needs* to be sent, it's not a good thing. When more transactions are coming into the mempool (money that needs to be sent) than coming out (included in solved blocks), mempool will keep growing (failed transactions will just get re-transmitted as soon as they're flushed). Upping the tx fee (13 cents suggested now) will let the highest bidders through, but if more transactions are coming in than going out, the losing bidders will simply need to re-transmit their txs, so mempool will keep growing.

Hard to say. When did the USD become decoupled from gold, and why did not the USD value plummet, keeping in mind that it was no longer backed by gold? 


Initially, every dollar printed was backed by gold or silver, until scientists realized how pointless full reserve was, when, in practice, most of the gold just sat in the vault doing nothing. Then some scientist had a eureka moment, realized that, since people are doing business with pieces of paper -- bills and punch cards, not pegging the whole magella to gold would save a lot of pointless hassles. And ...here we are :)

It is, as much as it is when you analyze it over a short period. 
Or, rather, it's not junk, but also doesn't represent what you think it does (actual exchange volume). It represents what the market makers want you to see. There may or may not be correlation between that and the actual market volume, but this correlation is far from direct or intrinsic.

With LN, people will be transacting via LN transactions, not transacting in Bitcoin. That was the first step in separating money from the the backing asset -- "here, we'll keep the clunky metal safe in the vaults, you trade in these gold IOUs/silver certificates. You're essentially transacting in gold/silver, without all the headaches of handling cumbersome metals." Eventually, money got decoupled from gold/silver altogether, with hardly anyone noticing or caring :)
