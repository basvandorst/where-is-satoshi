To say this is pretty ignorant. Perhaps most innovation you *hear* about is (North) American, but in reality innovation is the result of a worldwide effort, of which America is only a part. That doesn't mean that America isn't a big player, but the majority of all innovation happens in the rest of the world.

Not necessarily; simple devices could be made and sold to vendors that make bitcoin transactions easier. I imagine these could be sold for less than 500 dollars. This fixed cost is a lot cheaper than the ~2% cut credit card companies take. If the device really did cost as much as 500 dollars, the vendor would start saving money after 25k of revenue that would otherwise be paid by credit card.
The key here is adoption. This only works if a company has enough faith to develop such a device, vendors are willing to invest in the device, and consumers use it.

I didn't imply you said that and I don't have a problem with America; my only point is that America is not "the innovation capital of the world". If we're going to just name innovations, here are some that came from outside America: the world wide web, the steam engine, the three-point seatbelt, pasteurization, bovine insulin synthesis, carbon aerogel, single-mode optical fiber... The list goes on and on for both sides and such a comparison does not make sense.

MtGox has to comply with anti-money laundering laws, which results in you having to give them this information. While the currency itself is decentralized and it's hard to figure out someone's identity through it, exchange sites are not. Depending on where you live, you might be able to get some without giving up your anonymity.

While the idea may be correct, your calculations are off a bit. First of all, there are not 7 billion people who have access to internet. Around 40% does, and a part of that group does not have their own computer, using an insecure computer. You are also assuming that everyone who does have access to a computer will use Bitcoin.
Another problem is that being richer than 50% of people does NOT mean you are filthy rich. [It'd be like your assets totalling between 50 and 100k.]( assuming a wealth distribution equal to that of the US.

I think you would be better off just getting a laminator. I can get one of those for 30 euros, and a laser printer plus this paper would cost $80.

The thing about a PC that has never been connected to the internet and has nothing but the essentials installed is that you can be almost a hundred percent certain that there are no viruses and the like on it, so you are sure your Bitcoins are safe. You don't have to do it, but if BTC DOES go *to the moon* and some crook has access to your wallet, you're screwed.
Anyway, there are several ways of cold storage. One is making a paper wallet, another is encrypting your wallet file. They accomplish the same thing, namely that access to your wallet is cut off until you need it. Personally, I prefer the paper wallet, but it's your call.
[This here is a good guide]( I don't recommend using Wuala, because it is connected to the internet. Just use your flash drive instead. The part about using Linux and not connecting to the internet is not *needed*, but seeing how you want an offline wallet for security, it would be stupid not to take some precautions. 
Transferring funds to the wallet is simple and you can keep your wallet locked away. Just remember your public address; that does not need to be kept secure.
Checking your balance can be done without opening your wallet by looking the public address up on [Blockchain.info](
Transferring funds *from* your address shouldn't be done unless you want to cash out, because it will require you to connect to the internet, compromising security. Make sure to do it on a secure computer.
Obviously, make plenty of backups that you store in different physical locations, so that accidentally crushing the device or having it damaged by a flood or earthquake will not make you lose access to your wallet forever. Making several seperate wallets might be a good second protection against attackers. Do not forget your password. Do not forget your password. Do not forget your password. There are plenty of stories on this subreddit of people forgetting theirs, so make sure that doesn't happen to you.

The way merchants do it is by generating a new address for every customer and then check if that address' balance is equal to the amount you paid (not entirely sure about that last bit). The easy way to do it is to have someone run the webshop for you. Services such as [Shopify]( have been around for years, but that particular one has recently started to accept Bitcoins. I'm not sure how popular your shirt is and if it is profitable considering the costs to Shopify (I don't know if those are a percentage or a fixed amount), but that would be a great way to run a Bitcoin web shop.
EDIT: Shopify, not Spotify.

Mining a block means doing the cryptographic work for the past chunk of Bitcoin transactions, which is what the hive does once every 10 minutes.
Miners get a reward for that, which is equal to the block reward (decreases asymptotically, at 25 BTC now; this reward consists of completely new coins) added to the transaction fees paid in that block. You can look the latter up [here].(
EDIT: Also, the 21 million you're referring to is the total amount of Bitcoins that will ever exist. This is at 12 (?) million right now, and every 10 minutes 25 get added to that.

Actually, your idea of saving people trouble this way is counterproductive. Of the 1.2 billion people in India, only about [40 million]( use the internet. Assuming a pretty high adoption rate in India and surrounding countries (which is not likely), saying 40 million people who will use Bitcoin already know the Lakh would be generous.
So, 40 million people will benefit from calling it a Lakh.
On the other hand, at least 500 million (probably way more) are familiar with SI prefixes and use the internet - anyone that has ever been in a high school equivalent, really. 
Then there's also the fact that just about everyone who uses Bitcoin right now calls it an mBTC. Those aren't *potential* users, but actual users.
TL;DR Calling it a Lakh would be ridiculous.

The Bitcoins awarded to miners are in part created (25 BTC at the moment). Those coins don't come from anywhere; they are made out of thin air. The miners also receive the transaction fees in that block, which are taken from people who spend their bitcoins.

No, the value would be higher. If you still expect the same total value of Bitcoins, but a lower amount of Bitcoins, it should follow that the value of one Bitcoin is higher.

The salesperson uses a merchant app to generate an address that you'll send your money to. You scan the generated QR code, send the money and the merchant app will tell the salesperson that the Bitcoins have been received.
If you want to buy something in person with Bitcoins, get a smartphone with a trusted wallet app on it. Transfer some money to that wallet (or import your computer wallet), go to the store and tell the cashier you'd like to pay with Bitcoins. They'll take out a tablet and make you scan a request code with your phone's camera. Hit confirm and yer done.

You might be better off just making a paper wallet, because there is no chance of technical failure with those. Storing them properly will almost completely remove the disaster risk (primarily water/floods and fire).
Anyway, most USB drives will work for years to come, especially if you don't use them. They don't just magically break. Kingston is a well-known and reliable brand, so you would be okay going with them.
