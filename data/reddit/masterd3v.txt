Reality speaking, there just isn't enough demand yet to fill even 4mb blocks if that were the maximum blocksize allowed. Further, nobody would accept a blocksize in the 256mb range anyway, that's an order of magnitude too large. People don't want that, nobody would signal for it. It's an extreme example that distracts from the debate around modest blocksize increases.

Wherever there exists a bank, that bank will find a way to leech money from it's users. Otherwise, it has no reason of existing. Bitcoin was meant to prevent users from ever needing a bank or a middleman.

I respectfully and completely disagree. It's been well understood for years that the 1mb cap was to prevent spam/DOS attacks on the network.

I said they *aren't against it*. It's just not a priority, but a malleability fix is absolutely needed in the future and I've heard the developers over there say they support it happening in the future.
Further, PeterR actively said that he doesn't want BU to replace core. He said an ideal situation would be to have 5-7 development teams, all independent working to make Bitcoin better.
The blocksize debate is like someone who hasn't eaten for a week but also needs a haircut. Increasing the maximum blocksize is like having something to eat. Fixing malleability via Segwit is like getting a haircut.

I have not heard this once from any BU supporter or any developer, ever. I don't think anyone at BU thinks that Bitcoin can scale on-chain indefinitely. They are for off-chain alongside on-chain, but not off-chain at the expense of on-chain.
I'm pretty sure they believe that while we *can* still scale on-chain, we should scale on-chain as a priority.

I'm pretty sure it signals that miners want larger blocks and a decentralized blocksize.

Transaction numbers are going down because people are unwilling to pay high fees. This will push users to different cryptos.

If the max-blocksize were set to 256 blocks, those blocks would never fill. Blocks would slowly increase over time to a few mb as user adoption happens.
There is a difference between the blocksize cap and the actual size of blocks once transactions are added. There just isn't endless transaction demand to fill blocks that large. The blocksize debate is about the *maximum allowed blocksize* not the real true size of the next block (currently capped at 1mb) that has caused higher fees.
Further, the majority would never signal for that blocksize. They could set their max to that number, but it would never happen.

Well, this is odd because he was one of the miners who signed an agreement to run Segwit + 2mb hard fork.
Only when Segwit was developed without the 2mb or the hard fork did they change direction.

BU isn't against malleability fixes that would allow for LN and side-chain (off-chain) use cases. They have said that they support this stuff. I don't know why people keep falsely repeating this here.
BU says that we shouldn't force users off-chain or artificially limit on-chain applications. Core wants to limit on-chain, BU/BC want on-chain and off-chain (all approaches to scaling).

Even at full 8mb blocks nodes would be no more expensive to run. Maybe $5/month. That's "expensive" to you? Bitcoin could be worth 10k with an 8mb blocksize. I don't think a small change for nodes is a big deal, especially because only enthusiastic Bitcoin supporters run full nodes. There is also no evidence that the cost of nodes would increase (at all, anywhere). It's been a scare tactic to block on-chain growth. Hard drives are also super cheap for large amounts of storage space.

Hidden agenda? Bitfury has investments in ASIC mining hardware. A POW change would render that hardware useless.
Does it always have to be some grand conspiracy?

Mining is about profit.
After the block reward diminishes it will need to be replaced by on-chain fees with a high-volume number of transactions.
Segwit/LN pushes these transactions (after opening a channel) off-chain where the fee will go to the hub operator. 
This hub operator isn't securing the network but still gets a fee? That is wrong. Hub operators can be perceived as a middleman that Bitcoin was created to prevent (first paragraph of whitepaper).

Yea, he's basically saying that core controls things right now, and that thousands of decentralized miners should control it. 
Developers can be corrupted. Miners secure the network. Developers can all be paid by the same company that exerts influence. Miners have investments that make them want to support Bitcoin's growth. Development has been centralized under core. Mining is decentralized in that miners select pools to point their hashpower to. They have freedom of choice and can move to a different pool if they disagree.

It's shiny, heavy and comes from the ground. You physically hold it and you can put it in a vault and hoard it.
Bitcoin has no such physical properties. Bitcoin's only property that gives it value is that it can be moved anywhere in the world. If you take away the ability to transact Bitcoin on-chain, you take away the foundation for it's value.

Do you have a source where Jihan says he is against a malleability fix after a blocksize increase? My take was that he just didn't want on-chain artificially limited.
I don't think he wants the blocksize low. The best way to increase the mining reward is to increase user adoption. This leads to a higher price/exchange rate == more profit.
