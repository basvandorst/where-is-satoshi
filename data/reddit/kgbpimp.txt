Buy another wallet and restore it there. Always good to have a backup anyways.

But so far he only made $3.34. Not really worth the trouble of writing a bullshit post, IMHO. It is much easier to create a new currency, start an IPO and collect $6M in one day.

IMHO the worst is over, at least from the current wave of negative publicity. Bitcoin survived. I am guessing it will go up a little from here, once the exchanges open up withdrawals. It will settle down around $800, until some other news (positive or negative) will make the price go crazy again.

Nevertheless, coinbase offers subscription feature, so it must work on some level.

No, people can sell their bitcoins for $ on the exchanges and withdraw $. They just can't withdraw bitcoins.

Chabad would probably not take it down. Orthodox, on the other hand, really does not like change.

Japan says Bitcoin is not a currency, so it might not be protected under bankruptcy.

Please add Ethereum support (to wallet.mytrezor.com as well)

I still don't know what the last one means. Will we stop using years at some point and change our math?

This might be the beginning of the end

How did you get $28k?

When the shoeshine boys talk Bitcoin then sell, Hodl until then.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:45:21
Those who know don’t talk. Those who talk don’t know. But yes.

I think you have misunderstood my original post. Basically when the shoeshine boy, as in someone who knows nothing about investing, tells you to buys stocks, houses, or in this case Bitcoin, you know this is a bubble and it is time to sell. We are not there yet, so keep on buying.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:59:56
Bubbles are bubbles, does not matter what the underlying product is.

Ledger Nano S or Trezor

You should read about the great depression and the history of bubbles in the stock market, will put this run up in perspective.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:27:36
I am not worried

This is like blaming the internet for pet.com. This is like saying that if Omni or Maid fails, it will somehow have an impact on Bitcoin. Ethereum will survive regardless of what happens to the tokens that live on top of it. IMHO
