Based off of what I’ve seen in this thread, you’re in the minority sadly, everyone seems to think that the person should be forced to give up the account because the name is misrepresenting and Bitcoin should own the account.....if it’s been hacked or sold then I agree that it should be banned or deleted, but everyone seems to hate it because it’s posting an opinion that they don’t like 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:51:03
Yeah that doesn’t really answer my question 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:01:41
Like I said though, fees will still be an issue won’t they? People are going to want to be compensated for their bandwidth being used 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:04:25
That’s like the equivalent of leaving a bad review because an employee said “merry Christmas” instead of “happy holidays” at a store that you don’t actually use that is run by a church that sells decorations specifically for Christmas
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:33:40
Ok so it’s still the company doing it, meaning that even if people stop using coinbase other companies could do the same thing
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:15:13
As people move out, also because more people buy a house when they can afford it, there are less houses so the price goes up 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:29:53
Sweet! I plan on putting around 50$ into bitcoin/bitcoin cash (a bit into both, not sure about the exact amount yet) pretty soon
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:56:53
Exactly, we don’t get made at book stores for selling books because it’s “stealing amazons idea” or something, they’re two different things 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:00:00
Or maybe they agreed with the sentiment that bitcoin core is moving away from what it was designed to be? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:55:00
Wait I thought that no one controlled bitcoin core? Wasn’t that it’s whole point? 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:18:38
Yes obviously it is better than most fiat currencies, but still claiming that bitcoin in infallible or that it isn’t a fiat currency at all aren’t true at all 
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:20:41
Why do they need lightning? From what I’ve heard and seen their transactions are already fast and cheap, not trying to start anything, just wondering if I missed something about lightning 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:45:39
So its really not that the users fault, the people who built the bathroom built a crappy design of toilet and refuses to get a better one, despite everyone wanting one? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:07:00
I didn’t assume you were being sarcastic, I assumed you were one of those people who don’t realize that people can find flaws in things without knowing a solution, and I never said it was the only one 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:52:58
But why did it happen and why are people ok with it? I thought Bitcoin is supposed to be completely uncontrolled
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:13:35
Wait how are the users doing it? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:33:21
How do you know it’s impersonation? I keep seeing people saying to report them for impersonation but idk why 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:17:07
So the whole thing with expenses for running nodes, hasn’t technology advanced enough and prices for computers and such dropped enough that larger blocks are more feasible? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:22:43
I’m kind of new to how transactions with bitcoin works, is this the equivalent of saying that you can spend Euros in America if you convert it to USD first? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:23:05
I think he meant the dark web stuff or whatever, since bitcoins anonymous 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:12:52
Yeah but it’s not Bitcoin Cash that’s making the “attack” right? It’s the company that is making the website that made the decision, obviously Bitcoin Cash users approve but approval doesn’t make them responsible for it right? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:20:18
Did Op seriously get banned for posting bad news? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:10:51
What’s malicious about Bcash? I’ve talked to people from both groups (bitcoin and bcash) and Bcash supporters (at least from what I’ve seen) have been kind and helpful
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:58:45
One of my friends explained what bitcoin to me was like 5 years ago (I didn’t understand much of it) and he had a flip phone
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:20:43
How is it unethical to talk about a different currency? Also don’t you want people who have researched cryptocurrencies and want to actually use bitcoin rather than just buying it as a “get rich quick” plan? Because what I personally see happening is a handful of people who invest without doing any research buy into bitcoin cash, and everyone else realizing that they are two separate things quickly
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:15:16
Yeah and because of that the demand for college and cars and houses increased because more people could afford them, so the prices of those things increased 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:24:38
So people should just not say anything until Microsoft says something next time because god forbid the situation might change? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:25:55
Report them for what? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:54:34
I get the basics of cryptocurrency, the block chains things has just been a bit confusing, thanks though I’ll read that! 
Edit: ok so I read through it and it sounds awesome, but if it’s just a direct transaction, doesn’t that give people the ability to hide transactions? Because one of the big things about bitcoin is that you can see every transaction that occurs, with the lightening network you won’t have that, right? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:22:37
Are you saying bitcoin doesn’t have high fees? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:53:35
What even is a “concern troll”? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:11:19
So what exactly does Segwit and the Lightning network do? I keep seeing people talk about how it will make the fees go away and fix the transaction times, but from what you’ve told me this is a complicated issue that doesn’t look like it has an easy solution? Sorry for asking so many questions :P
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:45:43
So basically anyone with gold beandwidth can contribute still? People who have fancy stuff like Google Fiber? How is this any different from saying “only people with good computers can mine bitcoins, this won’t be decentralized are all!”? Like I get why people are worried but at the same time it doesn’t make much sense 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:08:55
Not really, you aren’t an official spokesperson for the currency, you aren’t claiming that the Zimbabwean dollar is the US dollar, and people shouldn’t buy cryptocurrencies because of someone’s twitter
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:58:50
Sorry, typically when I try googling guides and explanations when it comes to cryptocurrency end up being confusing and use terms that I don’t understand, I’ve had way more luck with just asking people here because they give simplified explanations, I’ll go look on my own though 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:11:14
I see what you’re saying but if they raise fees too much people will stop using it, but that last question was less about bitcoin cash and it’s ethics and more about your opinion on regulating the currency, not to abuse it but to keep the currency stable, like IF it was set up similar to the federal reserve, where it’s open about what it does, wasn’t malicious, not sneaky deals or anything like that? This is more of a hypothetical cause I’m curious on your view on regulations 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:55:56
I meant the original users who moved over to bitcoin cash when it first split off
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:12:56
You need a source that they’re working on fixing a bug that is already well known? I have seen a few people talking about it but I don’t recall which post it was under, you can probably find people talking about it in though 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:31:16
I thought it was because they felt bitcoin was straying away from its original purpose of being a currency, and that was why they claim to be the original bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:22:40
And what’s that backed by? Thats like claiming that the usd dollar is backed by the government therefore it’s completely different from fiat currencies 
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:15:35
Is maintaining the price by removing and adding currency into circulation a horrible thing though? The same thing is done by the federal reserve to keep the US dollar at approximately the same value, obviously the fact that they are hiding it is unethical and sketchy, but it seems like a good way to ensure it sticks to its purpose, a currency instead of an investment. At this point I have a lot to think about and this is more about being curious about your opinion than convincing me that Bitcoin Cash is unethical 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:53:45
Sorry I didn’t realize that using the term Bitcoin Core was wrong, that’s just what I’ve seen people using when discussing bitcoin and bitcoin cash 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:43:07
Wait how do you move something OUTSIDE of the block chain? That doesn’t sound like it makes sense, and won’t a lightning transaction still have the same issue? Where there are massive fees? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:53:36
Thanks for the awesome explanation! Just one quick question, why does Bitcoin core use a small blocksize limit if a larger one fixed everything? I presume there are negatives to having a larger one? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:48:50
I thought that the whole thing was because they feel bitcoin cash represents what Bitcoin core was supposed to be? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:50:48
But those are just companies, people had to have a reason to support bitcoin cash or else it would have crashed and burned 
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:25:07
Just took another look through the rules and I don’t see anything that OP did to deserve a permaban, is there a different set of rules or something that I missed?
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:52:48
So what exactly is the ASICBoost? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:59:39
If your fork leads closer in the original direction of bitcoin and you could gain enough support then I don’t see why not 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:39:02
But it’s true that they think they are the original bitcoin, are you saying that they don’t think that? Because everything I’ve seen points to them thinking that they do
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:52:15
Doesn’t this mean that it currently has fewer transactions, but a higher transaction LIMIT? As in most of the blocks aren’t being used, not because they can’t be used but because there just aren’t enough people using it yet? Sorry if I’m misunderstanding what that means 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:43:52
Yeah I’m really excited, real quickly though, how much time per day would you say you spent staring at the charts and such? Was it just once or twice a day or was it constant? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:33:52
Oh damn.....so how is the price manipulated? The Bitcoin price is volition and completely unpredictable, what makes Bitcoin Cash different? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:23:45
Idk from what I’ve seen that community has been pretty nice and supportive, the Dogecoin community might be where you want to go though 
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:43:30
So I disagree with you therefore I’m a shill? And what “wave” am I riding? I just don’t see why this is worthy of banning someone’s twitter 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:14:57
I find it concerning that a single business can essentially cripple bitcoin, is there anything that can be done to prevent more companies from doing this in the future?
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:05:13
Heads up, OP was banned for posting this, apparently posting bad news is worthy of a ban 
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:07:11
Ah ok, thanks for the explanation, I didn’t know that there was still a 10 minute transaction time 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:34:45
They’re already fixing it, and I don’t think this effects the average user 
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:29:32
Population has increased too, also have you noticed that everyone owns things such as microwaves and TVs? That’s because of manufacturing being cheaper 
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:34:52
That’s true, but won’t the same thing happen with lightening? Or can anyone set up a lightning network?
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:00:52
Oh ok that’s actually pretty easy to understand, how do you know that that was the reason for the deprecation though? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:20:00
Why wouldn’t big news like this gain traction quickly? I don’t think this is some “shill propaganda” or anything like that, as for the person being inactive for 8 months they could have just been lurking
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:31:11
Oh ok thanks! I had a faint idea it was something like that but I wasn’t positive 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:57:52
But the person provided proof that they were banned 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:56:55
You didn’t, but many people believe that though 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:57:49
What does that have to do with my comment? And does that count as brigading? Encouraging mass bad reviews? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:25:39
I’m serious, for the most part people on both sides have been kind and helpful, and willing to answer my questions about how stuff works
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:09:48
What’s wrong with advertising other coins? Should I be against anyone who uses Euros because it’s not my currency? And I thought the bitcoin market was incredibly unpredictable? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:28:13
Are people seriously mass reporting a twitter account because it started posting things they didn’t like? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:54:19
Typically I’m against leaving mass negative reviews because people are unhappy with something unrelated to the app or product, for once I agree though 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:06:41
Well if he changed his stance on a cryptocurrency he obviously has an ulterior motive, people have motives, it motivates them. His motive is probably to promote the usage of one cryptocurrency over the other, the reasoning behind this is something I don’t know, I don’t even know who the guy is (I’m assuming you’re talking about the twitter though) so I can’t really make assumptions about his reasoning 
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:24:46
Isn’t that exactly what a fiat currency is? As long as people are willing to spend time working to earn it it retains value 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:24:51
Except that amazon is a company not a currency, the same could be said about USD, every state used to have its own currency, the currencies were flawed, so a country wide currency was created, the US dollar, obviously cryptocurrencies are pretty unique so it’s hard to make working analogies 
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:38:02
Yeah I didn’t know that, but wasn’t bitcoin meant to be a currency? Not a volatile method of investment? I presumed that was what they meant when they claimed to be what bitcoin was meant to be  
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:38:55
But those are products, cryptocurrencies are a currency, not a business relying on advertisements for revenue or anything like that, I don’t get mad at people for using other currencies around the world, and talking about things that are happening to that currency isn’t “shilling” 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:16:24
I tend to do that just so that I have a way to back out if I get yelled at because I misunderstood something lol, I was pretty sure that’s why they used the bitcoin name but I wasn’t absolutely 100% without a doubt positive and I didn’t want to have dozens of people correcting me 
Edit: weird this isn’t showing up if I go through the post, only if I go directly through the comment 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:30:47
I think that a person is slightly different than a currency lol, if you have a house built, and you build on a bunch of attachments and such, new rooms and things like that and repurpose it as a bank, but then decide to remove all of the additions and alterations so that you can live in it again, it’s returned to its original form, it’s hard to come up with working analogies, but it’s taken something and returned it to its original shape 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:24:20
Yikes... what makes you think that they’re turning a blind eye to this stuff? I’m new to both bitcoin cash and bitcoin, and today is the first I’ve learnt of this whole Chinese mining cartel thing (someone else said something similar to me somewhere else, might have actually been this thread) 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:47:55
Wait how is this an attack? It’s just a new website that’s used for buying and selling isn’t it? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:35:42
But the headline was true at the time 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:52:07
Except they aren’t claiming to provide “Flowers for Algernon”, they never said that they would be using bitcoin core, getting mad at them because they are allowing Bitcoin Cash instead of bitcoin core (or legacy now apparently)  doesn’t make any sense 
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:29:18
How is it misleading? If an account called  commenting on something happening to bitcoin or to bitcoin cash be unethical and misleading? It’s not like the account is claiming that it’s Bitcoin, it says right there that it’s Bitcoin Cash, not Bitcoin Core 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:21:52
Oh sorry, but still they believe themselves to be the original bitcoin in the sense that they are closer to what bitcoin was meant to be, a currency rather than just a tool for investing 
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:00:40
I’m still a little lost on what the blocksizes do, any chance you could explain it to me? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:55:45
Oh ok, I thought that one of the issues with it was that it was difficult to set up and such, good to know thanks! 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:35:05
But then why is everyone against increasing the block size? If it’s done slowly as technology advances so that plenty of people are still able to handle the blocksize so its not relying on a handful of people, then there’s no problem 
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:53:39
I’m just sitting in class on Reddit because I finished my project, I wish I could get paid for this kind of stuff, any idea who I’d talk to for that? I don’t know a ton about cryptocurrencies to be honest, but I just don’t see the issue with someone talking about a different cryptocurrency, is the person required to say something along the lines of “Hey guys check out bitcoin cash, it’s pretty cool, heads up if you decide to buy some based off of a single tweet, it’s not actually bitcoin but is a separate currency with a similar name” or risk being accused of being unethical and using “shady tactics”? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:46:23
Yeah I dunno I think the names could get confusing, but BTH users believe that they are the real bitcoin so I kind of get it 
Edit: btc changed to bth
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:14:09
What? I’m agreeing that it’ll be a problem because of the confusion it could cause, it’s common knowledge that bitcoin cash users believe that they are the original bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:25:31
I don’t have one, if even I was able to come up with a solution just like that, then the issue would have been solved long ago by someone else lol, it’s possible to take note of a problem without knowing a solution 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:13:01
So then as more people make transactions, the block size could increase until it stabilizes, like putting down ATMs everywhere until the demand for them drops, and people can make transactions whenever and wherever they like, couldn’t it? Or is that just not feasible with current technology? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:22:20
Well yeah it was influenced by someone, that’s how companies work, they look at information and make decisions on what they think will be the most profitable, the people running the site believe that supporting Bcash openly and fully will lead to the most profits, now, could there be some corruption involved? Maybe, I don’t have any way of knowing, but I just think it’s dumb to assume that Bcash users are all secretly behind this and that it’s a personal insult or something 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:34:48
Probably not, but this time it won’t be stickied as “misleading” for 12 hours even after multiple people confirm it to be true so I’m sure it’ll be just fine 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:50:34
Well we don’t even know that’s what happened, if someone hacked or bought the account then yes actions should be taken, the same goes for  but if the person just switched their opinions then nothing should be done 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:11:12
Oh, nah I’m just overly cautious because I don’t want to be seen as aggressive and then look like a moron cause I got something wrong, I’ll keep that in mind from now on though 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:52:44
Oh ok, thanks for explaining! 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:05:38
How long did this take you, just out of curiosity? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:15:56
It’s still a valid concern, a single company did this, what’s to stop others from doing this? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:10:06
So what were they banned for? They don’t have any recent posts or comments aside from that 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:57:16
Except cryptocurrencies aren’t a brand, they’re a currency, that’s like saying someone is actually Japanese if they ever pay for something using Yen to buy something, or for saying something positive about another currency 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:56:15
I guess, but we still have the problem of fees because people providing the lighting network are going to want to be compensated for their brand width being used, right? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:38:39
Idk from what I’ve seen they seem pretty neutral on this 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:49:06
Not offering a service that they don’t have to give, and that they never stated that they would give isn’t worthy of a bad review, that’s like going to Walmart and not finding a specific book you want and leaving a bad review because of it 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:47:24
Yeah, obviously this doesn’t prove anything, but neither does a Reddit post
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:27:50
I’d prefer an app for convenience and being able to buy and sell whenever, but I’ll consider it if I can’t find an app :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:51:57
What’s a non shitty, but super easy to use and understand app for cryptocurrency transactions? I was going to use coinbase but after all of these complaints I’m having second thoughts lll 
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:54:32
Isn’t that brigading? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:26:58
Wait wait wait, I had it upside down. It’s over 9000
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:56:31
Whoops, fixed!
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:52:48
Better test a bunch of non porn sites that should be blocked, just to make it look like a real test
