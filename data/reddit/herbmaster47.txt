If op is American that makes perfect sense.  There's a big difference between changing your life and getting close to what we consider "the rich".  
Hell 50 k would change my life, but not my lifestyle.

Beans at Aldi are 50¢ a can you can eat for 2.50 a week!

Gas where I used to live, not all places have the infrastructure for it though.  In FL you can get propane tanks installed at your house if you live in a rural area.  Not sure how that stacks up.  Electric heating is expensive as hell.
Ninja edit: unless that electricity is earning you Bitcoin in the process.

From what I understand (which is very little), it's not worth it in the short term.
  A gross simplification would be that it costs you 1¢in electricity to get .1¢ in Bitcoin.  However the value of that .1¢ could grow to where it is a net positive as the price of BTC goes up.

Thanks man.  I'll check it out this evening.  Appreciate the point in the right direction.

Ok yeah it's hobby level.  I know I'm not going to get rich.  Just something interesting.  I guess you have to setup a wallet or something too. Been loosely following things for years but of course never bought in or anything.

If you have to pay capital gains on it it's only anonymous in that no one knows who's wallet is who's.  When you file your taxes and claim gains on the sale of 10btc for 80k then they'll know you had it, when you say you made 72k then they know you bought when it was 100 bucks per coin.  They could roughy pin down when you purchased and they timeframe you were holding.

And he could've been the libertarian presidential candidate.  Would've had my vote.

If I wanted to start mining, what do I need to do on my laptop to start? It's a decent computer, is it worth it?

That sounds cool. Good to help the other crypto communities I figure.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:07:43
In the long run, yeah I figure, but isn't the mining rate a day a very small fraction of a coin? Like 0.0000001 coins per day?  And your using whole cents of electricity to do it.

Ok I've been following this and just have a few questions.
1. Where does the value of the coin come from, what's to stop it from being 50k per Bitcoin.
2. What's in place to keep it from crashing?
I'm not trying to be a wet napkin about things, but with this recent Spike it's getting to insane values.

Yeah this is my big fear for the people I see dumping large (hopefully disposable) amounts of money into the system.
I just meant like how countries have an economy based entirely on oil (for example).  Everything is fine when oil is 100$ a barrel, then it drops to 25$ due to cheaper processing being implemented.  Bitcoin is based on itself, which can be a double edged sword I suppose.
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:55:25
Yeah I've been talking to a couple of my friends from work about mining, and it seems like it's almost impossible to come out with a profit due to power alone.

Thanks that helps.  The value of the currency is based around the agreed value of the currency based on the users of the currency itself, instead of outside, easily manipulatable forces.

Thank you.  They're amgs for people who can't afford amgs.
