Thats nice of you. When you say they can adjust to problems. Does that mean they can update/upgrade the core code? someone told me that was impossible.. mind you they dont know half of what you seem to know. I've tagged you as the bitcoin guy. Sending you a PM with a more personal question if you dont mind.

Stop assuming. They would't be touched no matter what happens over the next years. Also, not my last cents. I am ready to take a complete loss and only have my self to blame for it. Running to my sanator? hehe yeah you got me.

Hope you made alot. It was right to sell by the looks of it. You could rebuy at a way lower and get back into it again i guess? i too struggle to see its real uses. Like i mentioned in my other post it really appears to be an underground currency as of right now. Fail to see how the avarage joe would be using it in the future. But i don't know. Also someone told me when quantum computing comes it might ruin all current crypto currency. What do you think? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:04:27
I am thinking the same. It will probably drop again, but im not sure if it will be as bad as the recent one. What do you think?
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:20:44
Did not know there had to be alot of effort behind a question for it to be taken seriously. Thanks for your low effort feedback though.

It stuns me that you are willing to type that much and so well to a complete stranger over the internet. I am guessing it comes easy to you. I have the authentication on everything i deem important, so its on, but only he SMS option. I will check out the other one. Also the vault feature they have could be an option but at the end of day i am trusting them. Hardware option would be better and safer like you say. Something i should consider if it starts turning into a decent amount in the future. 
Digital gold, which means even if something comes to try to take its place. It wont ever completely replace it? 
I mention coinbase because from what i have read they are the biggest and safest one out there. I could be wrong, and there could be a downside to them that i don't know about. But i am ready to invest some into it, so choosing the right one to begin with would be good. 
Where i live there is a bank who recently made it avaliable for you to see your bitcoin balance through your online bank. Only one bank has done this so far but its a start. But to be able to do just that you have to have an account on coinbase. It just reads your balance through that. 
By the way what do you think quantum computing will do to crypto currency and especially to bitcoin? read somewhere that once that comes out it will be the "end" of all these current cryptos? 
again thanks for taking the time, hopefully its not too painful for you to read.

Haha yeah, i think the same thing would happen to me. It would probably make me check it all time as well. Just now i am tempted to check bitcoins value once in a while but i have to force myself not too.  I am planning on having them in there for years so i don't see the point. :P only thing would be if it was to drop massively i could buy more at a lower price. But if that were to happen it would come out in the media anyway i guess :)
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:29:56
Hmm yeah. I am not talking big numbers here really. It would "only" be around 1200 in USD. Which for someone like me is alot of money for something like this. I'm thinking as long as bitcoin is still around in 5 years, there should be very little chance of loosing anything?
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:23:08
Thanks i see. Everyone wants to get the most out of their money. But do you think it matters that much if were talking really far into the future? 5 years might be too little. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:58:45
Thanks for the answer, i would have consider that money a loss the second  i converted them to bitcoin to make it easier to deal with. With a slight hope that it was worth it in years. Never know.. 
It loosing out to a different currency, how could that happen? isen't this whole thing a popularity thing really? which means something has to become more popular for it to loose out?. I dont see how at the moment. But maybe you see reasons? thanks again
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:50:23
Yeah, its a little bit high right now i agree. Like you said it wouldn't matter that much when im waiting that long. I have done some research and thought about it. As long as the bitcoin market grows i don't see it failing. A question i asked myself is why would the avrage person pay with this currency over just using their credit cards in the future. To me right now, it seems abit like a shady currency. But i dont know that much about it.

Really appreciate you for taking the time. I get the spreading part now. I know you are just using examples but do you think it will drop down to 6500$? or alot lower than what its currently at? do you think it will be that unstable and keep going up and down? 
Also you mention a hardware wallet, is is that needed? i can understand people with tons of money on there having one.  
Aren't online based wallets good enough? like the big ones: coinbase, blockchain etc. While on the subject, which online wallet are currently the best one to pick as a first timer? i have coinbase and blockchain right now. Again really appreciate your help.

Sorry what do you mean by "Dollar cost average your buys over a month" i am not an native english speaker (not sure if i can blame it on that though) understand if it takes too much of your time to explain. Thanks for taking the time.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:14:38
The idea is leaving it there for 5 years, before even thinking about doing anything with it.
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:08:13
hehe, hear from you then.. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:24:18
Damn, how many do you own? :)
