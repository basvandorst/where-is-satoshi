The thing was, I had looked on the sidebar for any alternative subs (like a mining sub or a beginners sub) before making my post, but I didn't see anything at the time.

Thanks, didn't see anything in the sidebar.  Will try there if I have any more problems.

Some of the commentors were definitely helpful, but the one who said


was almost definitely not a socially awkward penguin.  He was just an asshole.

I didn't pay enough attention.  In most of the subs I frequent, they don't put the relevant subs so far down the sidebar.

I never claimed to even know what the community at Dogecoin was even like.  I said


It seemed like everyone was describing Dogecoin like that, and I probably exaggerated the asshole factor in the Bitcoin sub (my apologies about that).

I made a thread on this sub (because I couldn't find a link to the mining sub on the sidebar) asking for some tips for a beginning GPU miner.
Half the comments were basically "Haha, yeah, Bitcoin can't be mined by GPUs anymore.  You need a special device that is currently on a 6-month-long waiting list (and the wait keeps increasing)."  or "Fuck off, idiot.  God, I can't believe such retards post here.  I mean, I obviously know that an AMD 6700 will not even be able to mine .01 BTC in the next 10 years, so everyone else should too."
Bitcoin definitely has a bit more of a yacht club style community: if you are new, you will constantly be making social faux pases, and every regular thinks they are the most brilliant person there.
Based on everyone's descriptions, Dogecoin is like a bar style community: if you are new, everyone says welcome and buys you a round (even giving you some tips on the best beers that are available), and everyone has a happy time, where they don't care too much about making/losing money, but just want to have fun.

They said that they deleted most of the spammer accounts and were just dealing with spammers spamming their registration programs.

Too late now...

I came here instead of some of the other digitial coin subreddits because it is the most established, so I can count on more intelligent discussion (compared to places like dogecoin, where the comments may be filled with Shibe references).  I got some good tips on places to go for alt coins, so I am happy with that.

Okay, three things I need to know:
1. What is the exchange rate between Bitcoins and Altcoins?
2. What programs should I use for mining? (either Bitcoin if the exchange rate is low [ex. 10k-1mil Alt per Bit] or Altcoin if the exchange rate is high [ex. 1-100 Alt per Bit])
3. What mining pool should I use? (again, either Bitcoin if the exchange rate is low [ex. 10k-1mil Alt per Bit] or Altcoin if the exchange rate is high [ex. 1-100 Alt per Bit])

Fair enough.  Just describing my experience with some commenters here.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:13:49
I understand that now, but I didn't when I made the thread, and I did not like some of the local community because they were being assholes.

I have to decline your tip, although I do appreciate the thought of it.  My computer with my wallet just started a new habit of "getting a BSoD within a minute of starting up", and I don't feel like setting up another wallet on my laptop.
