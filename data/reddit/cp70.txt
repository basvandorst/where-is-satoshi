Millionaires and billionaires invest in equities and literally get paid back a ridiculous inconceivable amount for doing absolutely nothing. The current average annual return from 1923 (the year of the S&amp;P's inception) through 2016 is 12.25%. A millionaire with 10 mil invested would see a return of $1,250,000 for doing absolutely not a god damn thing. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class A was listed for $7,100 in Dec 1990, today it is worth $323,150.00. There are plenty of assholes who sit on that and make money for doing not a god damn thing and its nearly doubled in the past two years.

Oh come on. Any asset or store of wealth is a ponzi. If your hoping to sell to someone else for more than you purchased it for, its a ponzi. Regardless if it high yeilding or not, or short or long term. If it needs new capital coming in to keep it going its a ponzi. If it bubbles and breaks its a ponzi. The stock market, housing market, you name it. These days a currency is defined as an asset you are forced to use that has to consistently lose value so that you can't afford not get rid of as fast as you can for something else.

 In the US there is only Keynesian economics. Keynesians don't like economic cycles. Recessions can be good but they do their best to prevent them. So instead of letting the stock market go down. The market instead goes exponential which is happening now. So the cycle still happens but they don't like to acknowledge it did because they just postponed it. This has always ended badly.. every single time. Why? Because economics isn't an exact mathematical science. Its a social science. People aren't a set of equations. You can't always predict what they will do. So now what you have in the US is a Keynesian blissful dilusion, we mitigate risk at all cost. We now shape everything and try to make people behave how we want even by threat of physical force. Look at the militarization of police. This rubber band is going to snap back at some point, because it always has and always will. We should remember that Augustus was the first Keynesian.

The goal of flashing a large sell wall is to not let the price rise. People see it and say "If I buy here it will go down" others say "maybe I should sell" and provide liquidity for him to buy. Generally when you want to sell you flash large buy walls getting people to buy providing liquidity for you to sell into. I can't say this is the motive for what he is doing as there are many tricks to the trade. No one knows, which is why no one is doing anything at the moment.

Agreed, but money will always be controlled by the few. Even if its decentralized it doesn't matter. If the majority cant hold value in it because someone with unlimited resources can crash the value and make no one want it, then none of it matters. The reference point for value in Bitcoin is the US Dollar. We are up against a goliath and we are talking about entities that buy out other entities for a unfathomable amount of money to just dissolve them to not compete with them and/or multiple governments. Throwing what is essentially pocket change to crash markets is easy for them. Bitcoin is something that in theory could work but its easy to squash. Its going to take a long time and a lot of things going wrong outside of Bitcoin for it to work. Just for reference the US Department of Defense spends $20 billion on air conditioning. Does anyone honestly thing there isnt "Operation Chokepoint" on Bitcoin by a government or banks (which are essentially the same thing)? Nothing will change, we all have the first amendment to speech to say what we want and we can all yell as loud as we want. Except that money is the only true form of free speech and you don't have a right to that.

The answer to the question is if they knew about Bitcoin and understood that Bitcoin as a currency backed by 1+1=2 is better than "because I said so" they would use it. Also explain to them that they could use this technology to audit the same companies and government entities they don't trust any longer but know their tax dollars go to they would use it. If they understood that they can lower their fees for the businesses they own they would use. The list goes on and on, not to mention that BTC isn't just a currency and there's many other applications including voting. The answer to the question is, they havnt heard about it and if they have they don't understand it and if they all did they would use it because there's not really a good reason not to other than its not quite refined enough yet. So instead of asking "why would they want to use it?" (If you can't answer this question then you don't understand cryptocurrency) The correct question is "Why are they not using it yet?"

He's getting frusurated with our community. He's sick of dealing with what the majority is: speculators. I understand the frustration. I understand your inner struggle. However, he sorely mistaken. He wants to focus on goal of making cryptocurrency the greatest philanthropic tool of all time. It's not going to happen without a high price of a crypto and major user adoption first. His ground up sunshine, fluffy clouds and unicorns approach is flawed. You dont control what makes the world spin round. Things are top down in this world and your dealing with defining value now.  It's time to put on the big boy pants and use all the manipulation tools and greed of others to reach your goal of saving the world. It's the only way you will see it. Pick whatever shit meme coin you want, it's not going to help. As soon as it becomes valuable it will  suffer all the same effects as Bitcoin. The market cap is what matters, large money flow is what matters. The greed has to come first to give this thing value to make it useful. Do you honestly think that M-Pesa saw traction because it was charitible? It's utility stems from greed, like all money. This group of philanthropists you associate with in crypto will only get get traction when the rich get richer. Grow up and start swimming down stream, you may find it easier to hit your goals once you learn in the money world distruption comes from the top down and not the inverse. Enjoy your vacation.

You're assuming people care enough to record these transactions. You are also supposed to pay a state sales tax for online purchases yet no one does. The manpower to enforce this is astronomical. Some say it can be done with programming. Fine, but how do you determine that base price for that capitol gain for every transaction and tax it accurately? How about I sell my lawnmower for BTC and I use that BTC to buy a sandwich? This is impossible.

I see it as a symptom of a massive "trust" bubble that began rapidly deflating since 9/11. As a millennial I never was able to participate financially in what my co workers call the "good old days". Born in 86, I remember the 90s being pretty decent but after that I was drug through a fake illegal war, a housing collapse, where my parents lost their house not because of a bad mortgage but because the homes around it were foreclosing and the value of theirs plummeted, which led to whole financial crisis. They take our tax dollars and bail out the banks and the other too big to fail. By that time I got to college tuition exploded but then got out into an awful job market, although I can't complain as I make work for myself. Then all the Wikileaks information. Snowden. The collapse of the Catholic church and those scandals. I was raised Catholic but now I denounce religion. I now live in a nation that is so in debt it's an unfathomable number. I could keep going on this list but I don't need to. What my generation has learned is the government fucks you, the banks fuck you, the corporations fuck you, the church fucks you then they all lie to your face about it through the media they control.  Well technology and community are the only thing I can rely on. It's how I make my money and it's who I go to for support. We no longer have the option to vote to fix our problems so we use the only tools we have. Crypto-currency isn't part of a tech bubble by a long shot but if I am wrong then this guy is going down with the ship saluting.

I know its all very stupid but to troll the IRS like this wouldn't be that hard. You essentially have to do it now if you consolidate Bitcoins to any address. You could keep a wallet with your premixed coins that all have the base prices of the coins you purchased but mixed to one address. That address &gt; merchant purchase (lets say coffee) &gt; wallet grabs base price from each of its known base addresses that were mixed (say Coinbase transaction base prices and addresses) it calculates the capital gains from this transaction effectively having to report different gains per address that were mixed down to one address you used to purchase the coffee (because of course those coins were all purchased at different times and at different prices) &gt; you then enter in the receipt number and cost of item and item description &gt; it spits out a metric shit ton of line items for these forms that need filed. Go to fedex/Kinkos print off the 1000 pages of 1099/8949/schedule D forms and mail away :) IRS gets what it wants.

A Bitcoin transaction address to another address is just as good as a Western Union address to another address.

Actually its not fake. This quote, at least most of it, can be found on page 185 of "The New Freedom" Woodrow Wilson (1913, Doubleday, Page &amp; Co).

In all honesty, fuhck you. Fuhck you the same way same way we all say fuhck cancer.

Thank you, this is at least something I can get behind as recognizing as the beginning to a reasonable argument. Please understand that I am not trying to be rude or condescending and your answers are appreciated. 
As the economist that you are can you expand upon why something like M-Pesa has been successful? Why can Bitoin not become better and more broadly used than a system like M-Pesa. Can you also define what gives anything value as I see a lot of confusion to this topic. In your expertise should cryptocurrency and the blockchain have any value?

It will be really cool. Think of it like the altcoin community inside the bitcoin blockchain. You will be able to transfer your bitcoin into a chain tied to the main bitcoin blockchain. It's just using the scarcity and value of bitcoin. Say when you have a friend you tell them hey look you bought bitcoin but send the bitcoin over to the dogechain to get the characteristics of dogecoin but without the dogecoin seperate total ledger. You can essentially keep your community, it's coins characteristics and marry the benefits of bitcoin. If someone grows tired of that sidechain you just go back to the main blockchain all while holding the same value. It really benefits everyone and you can keep your awesome community.

What are you talking about? I'm saying Roth and 401k are good investments because of the equities market is basically a guaranteed return. Did you actually read what I wrote?
Actually you cant relate to this guy at all. He most likely views that theres a problem with the trust of the system in place which in turn pushes him to Bitcoin. US stock ownership being at an all time low, while QE is pushing markets to an all time high is indicative of sentiment by the actual US population. He's worried about 10k while you Mr. Clayton  are wealthy enough to fly around  and purchase/sell airplanes for a hobby. 
As you say "It's really impressive, when you look at the market of aviation. We've managed to create a market that only ~1% of the population can participate in, where everyone is trying to screw everyone else as badly as possible. Wall Street doesn't have shit on aviation." 
Apparently there is a lot in common with the people who flock to Wall Street and Aviation. Which makes it clear as to why you are here and not a fan of Bitcoin.

Yes it is. Its an issue that we don't know how to address. Going through some of these users comment history its blatant persistent onslaught off negative attacking comments in just this subreddit all day almost everyday. If you are so opposed to something when is the last time you spent all day, day after day, bashing it in their community? The goal is to slow adoption/destabilize faith in the community and it's working. 
I understand and agree with some comments when they are truthful but the vast majority are just FUD trying to insight panic and they are being up-voted faster and in greater number than down-voted.

If I send 1 bitcoin to a proposed exchange address. Prefix being say 4 - 4b9834982304943fshjdf3495g I know that address has 1 bitcoin and its on an exchange. Everyone knows that this 1 bitcoin is at an exchange. When an order happens the bitcoin is then sent to a different address. This happens when an order happens now. Now there is 1 bitcoin at 4akf3485g948uer93s9w0ii959. Everyone knows this.  Now we know that an order happened, the time it happened, and I can match that to all the exchanges orderbooks and reported volume.

A system where you are using btc for voting forces trolls to use bitcoin to abuse the system. Effectively using BTC microtransacrions to ban a user with agreement from a majority. This plus say a minimum 1 - 5 day new account waiting period for this sub could make for a effective democratic sub. The cash also goes to a good cause.

Sure I guess.. Now we will be able to really account for every cent spent just to make sure, but also with crypto you couldn't even attempt to spend it on something other than what you promised or allotted. Smart contracts have many applications outside of just charitable organizations that simply cant be done with traditional systems. For instance a company around here just now caught an accounting scandal that allowed someone to embezzle 30+ million dollars and was caught by a fluke. This couldn't even be attempted when smart contracts are put into place. The transactions to attempt wrong doing for even a single satoshi (currently $0.0000050585) simply wouldn't go through.

I read it. You can choose to keep supporting a system of your purchasing power going down by no choice of yours if you would like. Thats up to you. I choose to support one where my money I work hard purchasing power goes up. When I buy things that I need, if I can, I use Bitcoin. So what? I just convert my increasingly worthless money into the new currency when I buy things to balance it out 1:1. I am supporting the community, making money, helping the merchant make more money and gaining a discount on goods and services. Meanwhile I'm supporting a network to help the 6 billion unbanked or poorly banked and bringing asset ownership back to the worker bees.

I understand your point. I don't necessarily disagree with the psychology of low amounts, I just see it as a non issue. More people should use the protocol to encourage the quality of content.

Because its the United States, where you can't even think about taking a shit without the approval of some regulatory body. The country who instead of providing education to its people spends it all on a military to regulate the world. People here know they don't have a chance to just go ahead and do what they need to do without the fear of being raped by the government. Instead everyone just sits on the edge of their seat waiting and then cheerleads when they are a step closer for permission for a go ahead. These politicians dont work for you, you are serfs to them. What are you going to do vote for change? We little people can't fathom having the amount of wealth you do. Money is the only true form of free speech. We just go to our 45k/year jobs (if we are lucky) and work our asses off then come home, watch our football, eat our doritos and shut up. We are good little worker bees who consume as we are told. We can't fight anything, we take the lashing and then just say yes sir may I please have some more.

Nah I lost money. I'm an everyday peon. I hoped BTC could create better opportunity for people like me. Lowly little person from a white trash urban city in Wisconsin. I hate people and love nature. People ruin things. I work with technology and know the blockchain is a great thing. Took a shot on it, but I'm not smart enough to invent something usefull with it. But luckily I live close to my roots where money doesn't equal happiness.  But did you ever have that feeling like your getting fucked and you reach a threshold where you just say screw it. Fuck me harder, long and hard with no lube. I want to feel it. I want to feel alive. Like getting a tooth ripped out with no anesthesia. Fuckin give it to me. I've gotten more thrills out of bitcoin than whatever I would have spent that money on anyway. 
Here's what going to happen. I'm going to live to be a simple man who smokes a pipe and sits on my porch contemplating the exisstance of God and the meaning of life.

That plus more. You could use smart contracts to say "I donate to your charity but the coin can only be used to purchase medical supplies, water, food etc." They would only have access to the funds if they uphold that contract.

You are somewhat correct. Just to clarify that a wallet ≠ address. Just because you have a wallet on Coinbase tied to your ID does not mean that BTC sent between addresses in that wallet to different addresses in a different wallet service will still be tied to your ID. Essentially a piece of paper can be a wallet. 
Edit* Little relevant question to our role play session. Say I have BTC on an address  in a wallet that is tied to my name. I write the private key to that address down on a piece of paper and give it to someone else, they are now in control of that address. It's essentially like handing cash over. How do you audit this?

Which of these is the user base for Bitcoin? 
Left (Liberal) 
Liberals usually embrace freedom of choice in personal matters, but tend to support significant government control of the economy. They generally support a government-funded "safety net" to help the disadvantaged, and advocate strict regulation of business. Liberals tend to favor environmental regulations, defend civil liberties and free expression, support government action to promote equality, and tolerate diverse lifestyles. 
Libertarian 
Libertarians support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters. They advocate a much smaller government; one that is limited to protecting individuals from coercion and violence. Libertarians tend to embrace individual responsibility, oppose government bureaucracy and taxes, promote private charity, tolerate diverse lifestyles, support the free market, and defend civil liberties. 
Centrist 
Centrist prefer a "middle ground" regarding government control of the economy and personal behavior. Depending on the issue, they sometimes favor government intervention and sometimes support individual freedom of choice. Centrists pride themselves on keeping an open mind, tend to oppose "political extremes," and emphasize what they describe as "practical" solutions to problems. 
Right (Conservative) 
Conservatives tend to favor economic freedom, but frequently support laws to restrict personal behavior that violates "traditional values." They oppose excessive government control of business, while endorsing government action to defend morality and the traditional family structure. Conservatives usually support a strong military, oppose bureaucracy and high taxes, favor a free-market economy, and endorse strong law enforcement. 
Statists (Big Government) 
Statists want government to have a great deal of power over the economy and individual behavior. They frequently doubt whether economic liberty and individual freedom are practical options in today's world. Statists tend to distrust the free market, support high taxes and centralized planning of the economy, oppose diverse lifestyles, and question the importance of civil liberties.
Basically if your anti-bitcoin you are either a Statist or a Liberal.

Gox didn't provide rewards for closing holes and was always been shitty and Coinbase actually is becoming increasingly transparent. Until there is a way to exchange dollars for bitcoin without the need for a private company you will always have to use these services. Coinbase rewarding 10 BTC is actually quite respectful. I don't care about the success of either company but as far as both go Coinbase does not equal Gox. Sorry what was your experience in?

That whole post of mine was just me trolling trolls. A list of trolls doesn't really help. A system needs to be developed and enforced to call people's bullshit. I suggested using btc microtransactions for r/bitcoin users to label a post,comment or person a troll to either have them flagged or removed completely/banned. This would take some arbitrary amount, say 25 different users who each sent a satoshi or whatever to flag a person or post. The money then gets pooled and forwarded on to seans outpost or other worthy charity.

Because people would be able to wrap their head around "okay I want to convert my fiat to btc, how many bits can I get for 40 dollars, oh 40 bits.

Hijacking your comment. Hold 10k in a bank for 25 years and see guaranteed minimum of a 50% loss in purchasing power. Hold bitcoin for that long and who knows? Put it in US equities market and see what apparently is a guaranteed return fully insured by the US treasury printing presses and the tears of the middle class and poor. 401k or Roth IRA would have been probably smarter than Bitcoin but you have to realize 10k is peanuts either way. I'm sorry we live in a system where us peons are made to feel lucky we have $10k. You made a high risk/high reward investment but there are worse investments. If you lose the money, do some minor budgeting of your lifestyle and you will quickly see that money show up again. In other words grow a pair and stick them in your wife's mouth and support the cause you believe/d in while maybe holding longer than 3 short months. Otherwise take the rest out and do what your wife tells you to do with it and remodel that kitchen and bathroom or buy a half of a semester of college for your little brat who's destined to be worried about 10k just like your wife. If you believe the fundamentals of bitcoin then show her them and that's all she should need besides her faith in you of course..

Not saying this will work but I once handled this arbitrary condo fee thing for some grounds care work due to an extra harsh winter for my elderly parents that came out to the tune of $50. They stated it was going to be reoccurring for the next couple months. I fought it and said they already paid a fee for these things blah blah but they insisted we pay it or suffer the consequences (more fines). Well I mailed 50 $1 dollar checks. That was the last time we heard about it. It was funny nonetheless.

The flaw being that you as an individual can only be one "account". You shuffling your cash between your pockets doesn't matter. A Bitcoin address could either be yours or it isn't. Transferring money between two Bitcoin addresses isn't the same as you shuffling cash between your pockets. A transaction between two different Bitcoin addresses is the same as a transaction between two different Western Union accounts, technically speaking. It's cute you can't admit that. Your point is moot.

I agree with you, a large transaction house purchase would be positive blip in our circle. Coming from an investor standpoint let me put some logic into your position of selling the home. Either a very early adoptor or someone of some decent wealth would have to have interest in buying your home in West Allis in BTC. Someone of that wealth wouldn't be living there so they would rent it out or flip it. Which I guess is ok but the location is not desireable. Closer to the lake you are makes more sense. There is no benefit to purchasing with BTC over fiat right now. Are you offering incentives to do so? If they didn't have BTC they aren't going to go through the hassle of converting that size of fiat to btc just to purchase the house. Good on you for offering and good luck, I just think your a little early in the game for the West Allis market. When I tell people I spent my first 20 years in West Allis I usually get a resounding "I'm sorry." Generally I am proud of my roots but It was better back in those days.

Sorry, what does this have to do with BTC?
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:29:16
I don't think it matters. A transaction in Bitcoin from one address sent to another has the same weight as a western union transacting a dollar amount from one account to another. Who its going to doesn't matter, just because WU has ridiculous fees doesn't make it more legitimate. 
*edit* - Since you fail to understand lets make it easier for you since you love the "your own pocket" thing. Lets say Bitcoin wears a pair of pants that has two pockets, one of them has a dollar. West Union wears a pair of pants that has two pockets, one of them has a dollar. Bitcoin charges virtually nothing to move that dollar to the other pocket while Western Union does. We then take those pairs of pants and split them in half. Send two of the halfs to the other side of the world. Bitcoin costs virtually nothing to send that dollar between its two pockets while Western Union does. Who has the pockets doesn't matter, the dollar amount does. 
*You can downvote all you want you shills, it doesnt make the truth any less obvious. Bitcoin is growing and the transaction volume surpassed Western Unions.

The average American doesn't know of or at least understand Bitcoin yet. Also the average American no longer believes in its own financial or political system.

Go talk to any average American about their thoughts about the economy post 2008. They don't know what actually backs the dollar and why they need to use it, even the educated can't articulate why they need to with any true conviction. We've been drug through 2 very expensive wars and bailed out the too big to fail. They are tired of the way things are and they have little faith in the dollar.

How is age relevant? Sam Colt Was in his late teens when he invented the revolver. Steve Jobs was in his 20's when he invented the first successful PC. Here are a few more young inventors in history   
Blaise Pascal invented the mechanical calculator at 19, something that was hugely influential in the realm of finance. All of these things changed the world completely. It's entirely plausible that an invention like the blockchain or something similar could shake up finance as we know it.  
That being said, it doesn't take someone 30+ to recognize potential let alone invent something influential. Yeah, anyone can claim the people above are tad overzealous. However, what really makes not only threads like this but events in history interesting are the those who claim wisdom and invincibility through age only to be knocked off their high horse due their blind sided pretentiousness. 
As someone who has studied economics I can tell you that it is understood as more of an art than it is an exact science. There are no laws of economics, only principles with a vast range of opinions on how to implement them. A black swan event can disrupt it quite easily.

"The total stock of digital currencies is at present too small to
pose a threat to financial stability, but further increases cannot
be ruled out and it is conceivable in time that there could be
an asset price crash among free-floating digital currencies that
had the potential to affect financial stability. Potential risks to
monetary stability would only be likely to emerge once digital
currencies had achieved substantial usage across the economy.
If a subset of people transacted exclusively in a digital
currency, then the Bank’s ability to influence demand for this
group may potentially be impaired. The incentives of existing
digital currency schemes pose considerable obstacles to their
widespread adoption, however. This is discussed in more
detail in the companion article." Where can I read the companion article?
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:35:45
Essentially yes. Someone is willing to lose money on an exchange to crash the market, presumably to maintain a status quo, but not lose money to prop the market up. The amount of resources to maintain the status quo is far higher than there are VCs willing to prop it up. In addition, its always easier to install fear than greed. Feeling like your ahead is fine and as long as you break even you are fine too, but as soon as your fear hits that's a hard one to shake and ignore. I believe its those who dont want bitcoin to succeed purchased OTC and are dumping on exchanges. Just remember it doesnt take much but a couple timely shaped candles by a couple of professional traders working together. Unless there is mass adoption to out weigh the ability to control these markets I have a hard time seeing cryptocurrency take off unless its controlled by those who maintain the current system.

Why dont you use Bitcoins incredible market cap and giant network, and actual utility to do all your good charitible work? Bring your community over and "fix" Bitcoin. Oh that's right because YOU won't see the same percentage increase in the value of your  holdings that you can by the way of charitible marketing a tiny scam coin.  Much more good could come of using Bitcoin as your vehicle of choice, but you wouldn't do that would you?

The problem is you have a lot of people who believe in the technology. The issue is when people are told they should ride the wave down and short BTC they feel like they are going against their beliefs in the technology. In short, markets for the most part are removed far from ideology. In fact they always pray upon the ideological, which is why most of us are losing now. Ideology in a market is a very identifiable target, like a fish who's bleeding out for shark bait. The others can tell that there's a lot of people grasping onto something and of course 9/10 times the market catches up and prays upon it.....Always.. it doesn't matter if fundamentals are good. If there's a target to pray upon it will destroy it.

Here's a secret, Bitfinex isn't the only exchange you can short through. Actually you can short on any and all exchanges, all you have to do is borrow coins from someone and then sell them anywhere. This is happening OTC. You're seeing massive shorting across all the exchanges, some people are claiming there are not that many shorts compared to longs across the board according to Bitfinex swaps statistics. Lol nope. Yes I'm sure some of these huge dumps are done by panicking holders but someone with deep pockets decided to short bitcoin by brokering outside of the main exchanges then dumped it all on exchange.

This is the correct tactic to debate roger. It is also very evident that Roger has a deep grasp on terminology in the bitcoin space but complete lack of knowledge in engineering. He knows what a car is and knows what it does but no one should ever come to him to build one. He is a used car salesman, not an auto engineer.

Do you really want to establish the precident that every transfer of bitcoin is called a sale and therefore a reportable event? Cause thats what will happen. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 14:39:42
Really because they do. If you buy something with bitcoin that's simply a transfer to a different address that's not yours. To coinbase to cover their ass they have to report it as a sale because there no way for them to know. The transaction is outside their walled garden. If you don't believe me log into your account and take a look at your tax report. It's how they report but it's up to you to prove it to the IRS.

Listen homie..... when the IRS gets their records whats it going to show?... a sale. Thats fact. Sooo what now? Is it up to Coinbase to explain that your coins moving were you transferring to an address you own? 
IRS: Hi btcchef what up with these records? It shows you bought from Coinbase and your receiving addresses for those transactions are there. Then it shows they moved. Where did the coins go when you transferred them to these other addresses.  
You: I moved my coins to addresses I own.  
IRS: Prove it.  
You: Look at the blockchain.  
IRS: Sign the keys.

@_date: 2016-06-02 20:41:21
State-less as in they can't control its inflation? State-less as in they can't restrict the movement of it? I mean a Bitcoin is a ledger line, a token that represents something else that anyone can access if they prove ownership. That something else can be anything. So from what I understand your saying is that they really want the private key for all line items and to be able to create as many line items as possible. Good luck to all institutions coming to consensus on that. 
If monetary gain isn't what they are after and power is, a non-open non-universal blockchain with no native asset is just about as useful as a sql database. If they want a spot on the largest most secure one where everyone has consensus I have quite a few to sell and I will take an asset of my choosing for collateral. I'll take what I can transact in as of now, fiat.... or I may be open to I dunno... Truffles or Lamborghinis.

Coinbase does. So when, not if, they comply your transaction records show as sells even when you only transfered coins to a new address. The IRS will see sells for both transfers and conversions to USD. The Coinbase report you can download shows if you moved coins and the price went up, you "profited". It will be up to you to prove where the coins went and if you still hold them. 
Edit*- There seems to be some confusion. You dont owe any tax until you realize a profit on your coins which either means:
    
A. You traded them back for dollars at a value more than you purchased them for.  
   
B. You  bought something with those coins and at the time they had a greater value than what you purchased them for.
If you just moved your coins around you dont owe a tax, but its up to you to prove that to the IRS because Coinbase reports all movement as a sell.

The guy that always was a douchenozzle and when he went to jail you giggled and giggled about it until one day you found that even after his felony prison sentence he struck it rich on one of his scams, and the scam is for something you care about. He's scammed your family, friends and community. The chode from highschool who actually got successful for being an absolute fucking chodemeister. It's life. It's reality. You don't know how or why.

It only sounds snarky when you don't know ARPANET was literally part of the first test to use TCP/IP to connect multiple networks. Then TCP/IP was deployed to ARPANET as it's protocol. Much like your transition, the Internet and Bitcoin are a progression and while not the same as it's inception the end result will be wonderful. It should be loved, accepted and celebrated. Like the caterpillar to the beautiful butterfly you are becoming, we should come together to nurture it and help it soar.��

I don't have the answers.  We have the ability to freely discuss it. However when you realise that true free speech is monetary, Bitcoin is the answer to bringing that true free speech back to the 99%. Which is why I am here.

Yes in essence. However the root of the problem is multifaceted. The nutrient for the root is greed. We can't fix that basis of evil. Money is power. Power is the ability to control. The ability to control money and information is the end game.  The current financial system,  2 party illusion of choice,  voting system, educational system,  etc..  all walk hand in hand. It's more of a closed circle than a root system. Bitcoin throws a wrench in the tightly controlled cogs of the machine that suppresses everyone but the elite.

Agreed, they become offensive since having wandered far from their familiar surroundings. I heard if you throw bits at them they become startled and retreat back to their sub for a jerk with its den mates. Then quickly fall asleep thus becoming timid docile creatures once more however only for a short period of time. We still haven't mapped their mating rituals but there are theories that it seems they may reproduce asexually. It seems these offspring are consistently made from only one parent and there is evidence that that parent may have direct influence in controlling the offsprings actions. These are called 0 Day Trolls. They serve only two purposes, to support its parents actions and to reproduce. Often multiple parents may come together and rub eachother genitals but this behavior seems to only aid in the process of asexual reproduction.

Do we value the precedent set by bailing out the banks for their mistakes? And I don't mean the value of "saving" us from economic collapse. Where do you draw the line for immutibility, centralization, and too big too fail? Of course regulators will always want to control monetary flow and policy, and imo that has zero value in cryptocurrency. Ethereum bailout is exactly what those who control our current economic policies love, so if you're into it then I guess you've struck gold.

Thats not what I was implying. I was implying that USBitCoin you receive has the issues of it's corresponding fiat.  Which is what its worth because of its inflation and the astronomical debt. One of the most important things Bitcoin has going for it is that its limited supply. No government backed fiat crypto currency can achieve that. Besides, The US Crypto Currency already exist just log into your traditional bank account, yeah you have a number that you look at but that number is worth less every second that goes by and that freight train is not slowing down any time soon. Your faith in it isn't going up either.

lulz I used WU to buy Bitcoin from a seller on Localbitcoins in China (I felt safer using the online escrow). The lady asked what it was for because they were concerned about fraud and I told her straight up it was for Bitcoins. I told her I wouldn't use WU for this purchase if I didn't have to and that I'm purchasing Bitcoins to get away from companies like yours. Good thing because I couldn't get verified on Coinbase fast enough and got in around 189 right before the huge jump. Thanks Western Union for helping make money while getting away companies like yours. Enjoy your fees while you can.

I agree the whole saving bitcoins easily that is unpenatrable is a hurdle this technology needs to cross.  However, saving 70k in a online wallet, that could have been avoided.

I dont blame you for playing the game, unfortunately I was not born into wealth and my job while decently paying does not allow the risk. My exit strategy is Bitcoin since there is no real way for middle class to move up let alone store the wealth they have. I believe this free market will overcome the manipulation we are seeing right now, but it's part of the growing pains.

Why do think this is like a IPO of some centralized company? I believe Twitter will do well as a company, I could have bought and held Twitter but who believes in Twitter. This is a protocol that can change lives in one way or another. People have been manipulating the stock market of motor vehicles since its inception, however there is no denying its impact on the world as an idea or protocol. Until something better than Bitcoin comes along which all other altcoins so far are not, I have no problem going long on Bitcoin through its volatility and manipulation.

Here is my guess. Because the economy is fixed now and the fed can start backing off propping up the markets, all those normal everyday Joe the plumbers who own all those shares in companies can feel more confident in the dollar and their earnings off their investments. So no need to buy Bitcoin. Soon their work hours will be increased again, and the houses they lost will be returned to them. The national debt will be reduced from 17 trillion. College tuition will go down, wages will go up. We're golden! In other words Bitcoin is going to go down.

It is a good point. Right now people are hoarding without intention of using it to purchase things. I'm not an expert but I would imagine thats the case of any currency in its infancy until it stabilizes. Is it not expected that everyone is scrambling to grab their piece and when true value is determined (by comparison to something else) then its exchanged for goods and services?

The intrinsic value debate is bullshit. In a time when it really matters a loaf of bread will have more intrinsic value than either Gold or Bitcoin. When food and water are scarce I can have all the Gold in the world but if I have no food whos going to trade me for it?  It pointless to argue, our envy and necessity is what gives anything value.

People only use it as jewelry because it represents wealth. Gold has a strong history yes but essentially its value theoretically is the same as bitcoin which really is none. Faith and envy give its value. Bitcoins true killer app is the ability to send its stored "Faith value" at a blink of an eye to anyone anywhere at basically no cost. Gold cannot do that unless of course you have it in a vault somewhere and you claim to have a crypto currency that is representative of that wealth. That's risky because its only stored by one entity, but Bitcoin is verified by anyone who can run a computer. Essentially I find that stronger. Gold is great for the analog world for now. Bitcoin is great for the digital world of the future.

@_date: 2013-11-19 20:29:55
Well their graphic is actually more accurate to whats happening right now.  Your graphic is ideally what we mean it to be like. The problem is Bitcoin has no point of reference for it worth right now. It will always need a reference for its worth unless of course its centrally regulated and the governing body says "were taking away your reference point you cant have it. So now this is worth x, accept it." Like they did with the gold standard. I just don't ever see that happening.

This shit is wacky. What are you doing playing a zero sum game? Did you go into it saying if this goes down I'm going to kill myself? Grow a pair and hold for at least a day or two. Jesus.

Essentially yes. Someone would envy you for your 65 "BTC karrot" casascius coin necklace. Because of the fact that its worth 65 btc and at the current moment you can exchange that for a lot of goods and services.

Surely this was foreseen as a hurdle to bitcoins sucess. I wouldn't be surprised that a solution is offered if this goes ahead. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:37:06
It was generally very positive. It was basically a go ahead. The people I thought would be against it basically said "We have the tools to stop the criminal aspects of bitcoin, so go for it" Which kinda weirded me out.

I would personally would like to see less cheerleading. It gets to be like a penny stock forum in here once and a while. It's not helpful to beginners and causes them to make rash decisions in either direction. The less "Fuck you bro stop posting about Coinbase....TO THE MOON!" comments the better. The more professional and savvy this community is the more likely you will bring in buyers. You're revolutionizing banking here not buying into Skullcandy IPO. Right?

Anyone debating gold vs bit coin should first learn as much about bitcoin as possible then watch this Peter Schiff video 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:28:24
Correct it was meant as a joke. Maybe I'm reading to much into it. But a joke in a sarcastic tone portraying a third party. Example: "Oh I've lost faith in the dollar, I know! Lets just get rid of the dollar" Anyway, I took it as a marker of their concern towards Bitcoin.

What point of services like Bitpay dont you understand? If you have customers willing to pay in bitcoin why wouldnt you take it? You essentially endure less cost and maximize profit. You will pay less bills no matter the volatility. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:39:05
I'm having a hard time figuring out why the same economists say to purchase gold but not bitcoin. Don't buy things that appreciate in value because you won't spend it. The same goes for gold. I should sell more assets for fiat and store it, something that loses value everyday?

Whats the minimum to be considered bitcoin wealthy?
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:40:59
Exactly. What's the point of hoarding it if your not going to exchange it for goods and services? So like gold, bitcoin will distribute out and stabalize. Early adopters get big rewards, it's the risk they take. Late adopters get in then benefit not having their purchasing power lessen like fiat, win win. It's still very early in the game.

@_date: 2013-11-19 17:12:46
This doesn't really apply unless they are willing to keep the bitcoin. Merchants can use services like bitpay that automatically converts bitcoins to your currency of choice with no risk. It actually opens your business up to more customers because of no chargebacks and no credit card fees, international customers without exchange rates, fees etc.. list goes on. If more merchants used these services the price of bitcoin would go up and it would be unwise for them to not just keep the bitcoin. This would further fuel the whole bitcoin fire.

25% increase is a lot in 7 days however something doesn't feel right. Try converting US dollar to Bitcoin right now it's near impossible beside meeting someone on the street. I think what we are seeing is sellers not wanting to sell and buyers unable to get into the market. The volume is just too low to be normal with this much hype surrounding it.
