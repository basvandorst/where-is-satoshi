I use Mycelium from day one. Also bought Entropy wihich even today I like very much. You did great job with Trezor and Cashilla as well. So 1 BTC is coming from me no matter what future brings since my believe is that you already earned it. Thank you.

Buy - HPB Visa prepaid - 6.18% CC fee -  WORKING
EDIT: Today it is NOT working. Talked to bank they said on their side everything is OK. CC is valid and working
          but transaction with circle is not going through. CC works on amazon/ebay/store and play.google.com at the
          moment. Anyone else have problems today?

Short term only... Long term it will be just another alt... And Roger &amp; Co. will loose most of their assets in attempt to prop that alt. They will be out of BTC community stuck with their alt and BTC will be cleaned up from poisoned balast at the end...

First of all we must understand that in China nothing happens without approval and involvement of Government. I work there so I know how things play out here.
Big thing like Bitcoin is heavily on China Government radar and they are actively involved.
For the subject - there is strange coincidence:
Jan/Feb 2016. PBOC published whitepaper about BTC and it's benefit's for closed circle. More about it and explanation is here:  - it is only 6 min so i suggest you listen to this - will make many things clear....
summer 2016 Bitcoin Unlimited offensive started with many PRO BU mining pools surfacing like VIABTC, BITMAIN, etc Question is where does money comming from? There are rumors from China Government through MSSC - Ministry State Security China - check on web profile of that part of China Government - 
To me situation is quite clear. China is well aware of crypto currencies potential especially Bitcoin. They have no knowledge to develop anything close to it so they are trying to "hijack" control over Bitcoin via Bitcoin Unlimited operation which is well funded through China Government. Only problem they have is development. Since they are copycat in everything it is not hard to predict what will happen to Bitcoin Unlimited if they HF.

It is new service and they have huge load on infrastructure due to high demand. Give them some time. I have same problem. First steps are always tricky and glitches are to be expected in first years. We all can be considered as beta testers.  But it is moving... ;-)

I have problems with web and Android as well. BTC account is there on mobile but no cards. Balance is zero. Like backend is not connected to frontend... Well, service just started this is normal. In few days will be OK. I am with E-coin almost from day one and support is excellent. 
P.S. I deleted beta which did work well. Leave it until this is fixed. Maybe problem is only with us who were in beta prog....

Which wallet did you use? If you used Mycelium try to rebroadcast transaction. Helped me few times.

Sounds big? It is just 1/6 mcap of UBER or 1/55 of Apple! I see huge upside.

E-coin.io works perfect for me.
Got xapo as well but E-coin is primary by far for me.

Buy Trezor. Period.

Not just forked but heavily premined as well. 11.000.000 ETH was premined....
