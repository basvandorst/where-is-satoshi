Because this is most likely still giving you some things your healthy meal is missing, even if it's just one or two things. Plus, why is this a bad thing? If it's less time consuming and has the same if not more health benefits, that's a positive.

No, you're right, we can never be 100% sure, and I can't tell you for a fact that this is healthier than a well balanced meal. But most of the time, we have a very good idea. Like, for example: protein, fiber, vitamin b, c, d, etc. aren't exactly gray areas of "is this good or bad?"
Saying you can't cheat mother nature because this and that worked in the past and we evolved and blah blah blah is stupid. It isn't cheating. Biology isn't a game, we study and reason to get where we are now, and what we know grows each and every day. Life spans become longer instead of shorter because we use that knowledge to make things and change the way we do things in order *to* live longer, be healthier, and repair problems we find. 
In short, if this product took into account all of the facts about nutrition and daily needs that we know, then it's pretty likely that it's good for you. Not saying that you shouldn't still eat normal food to get  whatever it might not have, too.

The issue with that analogy is that it implies fapping is unhealthy.

Wikipedia is a non profit. You shouldn't stop using them if they don't accept nonmandatory tips the way you want.

I assumed you were asking for it to be put on the website. If not, where were you seeing that?

Really? Wanting to hear what the government (read: the people who regulate things like currency) says makes us boot lickers? Considering governmental response (or lack thereof) could very well be a strong factor in how well bitcoin is used by the public, it's incredibly stupid to *not* care about what the government says, *especially* if you're against regulation.

aaaand you just changed the topic. Whether or not you agree with *completely unrelated* decisions made by people in the government does *not, I repeat not,* mean what they say isn't important. If anything, the fact that you don't like the practices should make it more important to you. 
I don't really want to humor your jab at marijuana/other drug legislation (wrong subreddit for that kind of thing), but arsenic is natural, too. Should we let people poison each other with it, then?
^(Note: I fully support legalization of marijuana and other drugs, I'm just saying that it's pretty stupid to bring up naturalness as a reason to legalize. )

How about when Zuckerberg was working on it in college? Did the NSA hear about this one random guy in Harvard who just happened to be working on a website which would probably fail just like millions of others, but decide, "no, this one is different; let's get a backdoor"?
*Always*, right?

I'm guessing they're random then - mine only shows WSJ &amp; NYT, Zappos &amp; ShoeBuy, and TurboTax &amp; H&amp;R Block.

Criminals blahblahblah no anonymity either. I'm surprised she didn't say we should require payments in gold now.
Edit: and we need to stop the Silk Road type situations... Ffs are you saying people don't buy drugs with cash???

Assuming someone would exchange that many BTC or accept it as is.

I guess it was a V, haha. But yeah, that's the one.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:00:06
Why not both?

Highly volatile is not just a bad thing. It's been volatile for a long time, esp. after April. It's also possible that it will go up further to gain him another 50k. Considering all the press bitcoin is getting combined with the rising popularity, it's a safe guess to say that it will not plummet any time soon.
