No, you have to rub snake oil on the dragon eggs to make them hatch favorably. I have some if you are in the market. 1 BTC Sir step right this way.

The Block chain technology that Bitcoin is based on isn't going anywhere you can bet on that!

MTMOXy. Cause they have it. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 13:10:06
Yes, something very spooky going on.
@_date: 2014-11-14 22:53:27
Do you see computers and the Internet playing less of a role in our lives? Or do you see technology and innovation moving at an ever excelorated rate?
 It stands to reason that some type of digital currency will, by necessity need to be implemented to keep pace and reflect the times in which we find ourselves,  I mean it is the digital age and all. 
 I don't see why it wouldn't be somthing based on block chain technology. As far as whether or not Bitcoin can adapt to fulfill that role is an interesting question who's outcome I  look forward to witnessing.

It's obviously a combination of things and what you have mentioned or some variation could be an aggravating factor.
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:51:59
No because I cashed out and I'm waiting for it to crash down to $100 BTC so I actually enjoy checking the price. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:39:50
It pays to keep an eye on it.
@_date: 2014-10-06 05:56:59
NOOOOOOOOO, rub it's belly!

Nice spin! That's what I think. It's not often you hear a completely new angle these days. 
 Get your cheap coins, while there hot!
@_date: 2014-10-26 04:25:00
A crash in price is trivial because right now it's little more than a utility. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 03:37:51
Don't forget Karpeles thinks in numbers. Mark is..The lawnmower man.

Are we talking temporary insanity or full blown corruption? 
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:01:07
OMG it's raining cheap coins. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 21:35:35
Bitcoin is a utility, dressed as a commodity, parading as a currency. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:57:41
I am Bitcoin here me roar.
@_date: 2014-11-23 12:39:36
Well as long as your only doing it on the weekends.
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:05:23
That was a very provocative post.
 Well done.
@_date: 2014-10-07 08:47:04
OMG that is so, spiritual! 
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:17:38
If your really interested and you watch the market for a long time, a time will come when you just realize you can make a move and profit from it if that's what your after. I think you have to be the "right" kind of person to daytrade.  I was watching everything very closely when it became apparent to me that buying ltc was a lock @ $1.  Or more recently

Satoshi hacked GOX and now is selling large chunks of his bitcoin fortune to drive prices down so he can consolidate his BTC holdings as part of his conquest of world dominance because Satoshi is the Anti Christ.
@_date: 2014-11-16 15:40:30
This is actually isn't good news.
@_date: 2014-10-11 06:47:08
And I predict you will build an airport coming out of your butt.
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:59:32
So, this IS actually good news?

This should be an Asian female considering the whole hodl phenomenon originated from Chinese traders on the btce troll box encouraging the bracing against volatility in cute broken English.

Have you ever heard the term "don't look a dead horse in the mouth"? It's anecdotal....
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:13:31
Well bully for you. :D
@_date: 2014-10-08 06:24:24
When is the crash already! Ugh.... I wish it would hurry up.
@_date: 2014-11-02 11:26:51
@_date: 2014-10-26 04:01:56
Hopefully it will just hurry up and crash.
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:43:03
Wait for the bubble to burst ;)
@_date: 2014-11-01 17:23:43
Bitcoin is in a downward trend and there's still a ways to go down. Is that just too simple to understand or what?
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:24:07
BITCOIN! You are my cruel bitch lover.

If your at the conference don't you think you should be listening to the speaker instead of fooling around on your smart phone?
@_date: 2014-10-06 05:16:42
But if all these people are buying in @ 300 anticipating a rise, who's going to push the price up beyond that like allot of people seem to think?
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:54:37
@_date: 2014-10-30 20:04:00
Was screwing with your head the intended purpose or just a by product. That is the question.

Listen to me, it is a great exchange for certain people but if you run into problems they are not necessarily going to be helpful, especially if you pester them. Because they don't have to.
