If you're skeptical re: anarcho-syndicalism, read Orwell's *Homage to Catalonia* followed by Dolgoff's *The Anarchist Collectives: Worker's Self-Management in the Spanish Revolution 1936-1939.* Both are short, interesting reads providing a quick glimpse into what a libertarian communist (in the classical sense of both terms) society could look like. Rocker's *Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory &amp; Practice* is also a solid, if dated, primer. 
Most would agree that any form of anarchist organization of society would be utterly voluntary to the greatest extent possible. Often times during the Spanish Revolution, collective farming operations coexisted peacefully next to private farms; the only restrictions uniformly placed on non-collective farmers was an absolute prohibition on the exploitation of labor via wage slavery. You and your family are welcome to farm your own land - indeed, the collective would often help these uncollectivized operations - but you could not exploit labor to create capital. Every man has an interest in the fruits of his labor. 
The idea was that non-participants would see the benefits of collectivization and the industriousness of the collectives for themselves, and decide to join of their own free will.

That was really thoughtful of you. Motivated me to look into pulling the trigger after *years* of following Bitcoin. 
(I feel like I have to say this: I'm not fishing for tips. Good on you though.)
