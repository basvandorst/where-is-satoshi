Hey! I absolutely love your site and that you accept Bitcoin. I actually ordered your "try and cry" variety pack and it was shipped amazingly fast. I thought I liked black licorice but the salty licorice was way too intense for me. I've considered buying some of your sweet black licorice but seeing that Salta Twins is in sweet makes me nervous. Do you have any recommendations on what to try that is sweet and not intense? I would love a sweet variety pack to figure out what I like!

Awesome! I'll have to give those a try =)

Turnover is the number of shares multiplied by the price. Basically what most traders call volume. To get a rough estimate of the Bitcoin volume for example: 4,695,670(turnover) divided by 9.99 (share price) divided by 200 (each share is equal to 1/200 of a Bitcoin)= 2,350 Bitcoins in volume so far today.  
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:20:21

I believe you can sell through Coinbase in the UK. You obviously need to verify your account and might not want to deal with the hassle but it's an option. With a bank account and credit card verified you can get a $50k daily sell limit.
 If you know anything about trading, Bitfinex or Coinbase exchange are two other options.

No totally sincere. Everyone wants to know what they can use it for and a 20% discount at a place almost everyone goes is substantial and goes a long way in helping to explain the benefits of using Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-05-09 12:18:59
Most people try to aim for above 1.0. All trackers have different rules, what.cd has a ratio dependent on how much and often you download (my minimum is .16 because I never use it), IPT requires you to seed until you hit 1.0 on every torrent or you get a "hit and run" and have to use ratio to get rid of it. Basically it varies a lot!

If he deposited cash into your account why wouldn't it be available immediately? I've deposited cash into a friends account at BoA and it was available in less than five minutes. I would wait for it to settle, seems a little odd.
edit: The reason it strikes me as odd is it is strangely similar to the usual scam of sending a check for more than the asking amount and then asking the seller to send the extra money via western union to a "shipper" to pick up the item. The check says pending and sometimes is even made available but will bounce in 3-5 days and by then the western union transfer is already irreversible. Bitcoin is exactly the same way so be careful!
@_date: 2015-05-09 08:10:32

Oh wow... I scrolled to the bottom of the donation tab and there it is in a giant banner. I guess Revo was the last hold out. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:01:55
Yeah, that's wrong haha the volume is price times shares. There's no reason to multiply it by 9.72 SEK since the volume= 9.72 times the number of shares already, that would be redundant. All the other math is right though. The volume today was 545.9 BTC. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 00:54:06
They issued a statement after investing in Coinbase: “We see great future potential in bitcoin and digital currencies to allow us to better serve our members. We’re starting to see USAA members embrace bitcoin. Our research shows that USAA members are more actively engaged in bitcoin than the average consumer.”
The fact that they actually care what their customers are interested in makes me happy to be banking with them. It doesn't matter that they don't quite get the Bitcoin vs. Blockchain thing yet, they will soon enough. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 18:16:52
It's a play on words. Whereas your phrase is normally meant to refer to the debate surrounding the mind-body problem, the shirt is implying that Bitcoin is outside of the "machine" or system. I'm sure there's more than one interpretation but that's what I take it as. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 18:17:47
Probably a mix between just having showered and lighting.

How easy was the setup? I am really interested in purchasing their new node with the 160GB HD but I am not very tech savvy. Is it just plug and play? Also, if bitcoin core is upgraded I'm assuming I'd have to upgrade it, is this difficult? Any input is appreciated, I'd like to figure these questions out before pulling the trigger on one.

Yeah it's like Pirate Bay or Kickass but invite only and they have rules about uploading, seeding etc. The private tracker community used to be really hard to get into and a great community (although now most trackers are rushing to monetize their content hence the Bitcoin involvement) but still it's cool seeing all of them on board.

Did you not read the link I posted? It would very quickly become a very long wait for the individual trying to brute force the pin. After 100 wrong attempts the wait time until the next attempt could be made is a million trillion years. With 6561 possible pins they would have to be very lucky as well as gain physical access to the Trezor in the first place.
@_date: 2015-05-19 13:29:19
No, just over 400 BTC. Turnover is basically like volume but is valued in SEK not USD. The coversion rate is 8.23 SEK to 1 USD so: 767,646/8.23/232(current BTC price)= 403 BTC traded. 
You can see what they are valuing BTC at by dividing the share price by 8.23 (the SEK to USD conversion rate) then multiplying by 200 since each share is 1/200th of a BTC so: 9.66/8.23*200= 234.75 per BTC. 
edit: SEK not KES, I'm dyslexic 
@_date: 2015-05-22 03:43:39
The same reason you pay some teenager a delivery fee and tip to bring you a pizza instead of picking it up. People are inherently lazy. Also there's the benefit of having no paper trail for your Bitcoin purchase which I'm sure some people value.

I can't wait until they release their app and start offering discounts to Target and Whole foods. I personally know upwards of ten families who spend almost $1000 at those two stores a month and are very interested when I bring up a discount. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 06:16:50
Yeah, moisture is a big problem for collectors. That container that you currently have yours in is not as air tight though like the ones I have. You can send it to ANACS ( to have it graded. They are currently the most reputable coin grading service who will grade physical crypto. The ANACS holders are pretty good but still not air tight. 
ANACS has a conservation service which can often professionally "clean" coins but they usually don't offer that service for physical crypto due to the holograms on the back of most of them. Whatever their process is would most likely damage the hologram. Maybe they can do something for the bowl coins though since there is no holo, you can email them and ask. 
I don't think that the "tarnish" looks like it was caused by fingerprints. The bowl coins are known to have issues with the gilding and Mike scrapped 1150 out of the original 2000 he was going to produce due to poor quality. ( Many of them had gold spillage or the "tarnish" look on the edges that you are seeing and I think it was an issue with where he had them made not in the way they were handled. Bowl coins are the only silver Casascius coins of which none have graded MS70 so I think that is rather telling of the original quality, pristine ones are hard to come by! 
Yeah, a lot of older coin collectors on coin forums don't seem to quite get the physical crypto thing yet, I would stick to Bitcointalk collectibles section. There are many avid collectors there who can answer any questions you might have and it's a great community. ( 
@_date: 2016-06-25 03:17:06
Thank you! That is definitely awesome. I think that they are a solid long term investment whether Bitcoin does well or not as they will most likely have some kind of numismatic value in the future. It will definitely be interesting to see what an unopened roll goes for in the future, there definitely aren't too many around anymore as most people opened theirs and got them graded. Hopefully we both luck out and they are worth quite a bit!
@_date: 2016-06-25 04:49:12
I picked up a S1 and S2 redeemed 25 in the last few months. They pop up every now and then on Bitcointalk in the collectibles section. You could even make a WTB post there and I'm sure someone has one available. The 10's, good luck, I've been looking to pick up one or two for a while now.
@_date: 2016-06-25 19:40:33
The first bits are displayed on the outside so that you can look up the public key to ensure the coin is still funded. If the security hologram is peeled, there is a private key underneath which can be entered to redeem the BTC that is funded onto the coin. I think it's a pretty unique cold storage idea!

Sfblockchainweek.io for those interested. There is a satellite events tab on the website that lists tons of events that will be taking place throughout the week in addition to Epicenter and CESC. It doesn't matter where you go in my opinion, just come to learn!
@_date: 2016-06-25 06:19:06
Nice! Those are some of the harder to come by coins as many people did not take care of them since they definitely were a novelty item during that time period as you say. If they are in pristine condition I might be interested in picking one or two up from you if you're interested and get them graded, would love to get higher than an MS67 for my set =)
@_date: 2016-06-25 03:12:10
I've actually been looking for a copy of that newspaper but most people are asking obscene prices for them. 
Mine isn't tarnishing around the edges but I know a lot of them are. It is extremely hard to find one in good enough condition to grade PF69, I had to work it into a larger trade to get mine and was one of the last coins I needed to complete my set. Mike actually scrapped a majority of them because they didn't turn out well so they are actually fairly rare.
I would definitely recommend getting it graded so that it is safe in an airtight slab. Vacuum sealed in a fireproof safe or safety deposit box wouldn't hurt either!
@_date: 2016-06-25 03:14:24
Very nice! I started small but caught the collecting bug pretty quick. I eventually had to convince myself to be happy with what I have since the last 4 coins I need are way out of my price range (10BTC all silver/gilt silver and series 1 and 2 25BTC coins).

I'd be interested depending on what kind of coin it is. Some of them can also be very valuable. You could use an escrow service on Bitcointalk to make sure both parties get what they promise in the trade. I've bought and sold quite a few coins there and would be glad to help you out (or maybe buy yours). 
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:58:32
I don't really get why this keep popping up. So I transfer someone $4 or $8 worth of Bitcoin and they get $5 or $10 of Starbucks credit respectively, then I enter my email so that the balance is refunded to me after their purchase, and they give me the cash equivalent to 10% off their purchase...? 
I can imagine it now: "Oh that's pretty cool! My latte was $3.54." "Ok, give me $3.19, you get a 10% discount!" 
How many people walk around with exact change? I love using fold to get my friends and family exited about Bitcoin but come on.
@_date: 2015-07-01 11:44:36
Amazing job. Really great content and I love how in depth you go to even include ways to buy with Paypal. The only issue I have is from the perspective of a brand new user and is the "how I make $120k a year with Bitcoin" book ad on the site. It immediately makes me think, that seems like a scam, and the bad taste from all of the Bitcoin scam misinformation that has been spread comes flooding back.

@_date: 2015-07-30 05:36:13
Yeah, there is a public key on the back of the coin so that it can be loaded and the private key is hidden underneath that. In order to access the private key the coin would have to be completely destroyed since the screws securing it together have been coated in red loctite and then drilled out.

Funded by Xpring to assist with enabling privacy on ILP (different from Ripple and worth checking out) and advised by Zooko, a highly respected cypherpunk who has been in the space since the beginning. Zcash never tried to recover the trusted setup, not sure where you got that from. Please do some research before spreading FUD. Bolt Labs is platform agnostic and strives to add privacy as an option for every platform, not sure how anyone can hate on that as it is a clear benefit to the entire community.

That's definitely a good idea. I plan on converting to cash myself since I am trying to slowly acquire Bitcoin anyway and it would be 1% to purchase through any other exchange. So technically all profits online will be kept in Bitcoin unless I sell more than the $200 or so a month I normally buy. I have convinced many of my group members to start looking into Bitcoin and hopefully if we start selling products for coin they will realize how easy and amazing it is for online purchases. 
I like the no fees though and I'm sure the club will as well, I will look into it!

I see price as a poor indicator to the overall "seriousness" of Bitcoin as a protocol in the tech sector. Good graphs and analysis but time will tell if large companies such as Samsung will support the Blockchain or try to build something similar.  Here's to hoping it's the former.

To all of the events on [sfblockchainweek.io]( it looks like. Cool concept imo.

That's not correct. MS65 is selling for 4-4.2 BTC. MS66 would be 5-5.2 if you can find anyone who is even willing to sell one. I've never seen an MS67 error coin so MS66 is believed to be best in grade and is the most sought after brass coin since it's the first coin produced by Mike.

That's very odd... It was two of my friends, they both linked bank accounts, purchased $100 worth and I said I would split the $75 with them. I assumed I would get it when the purchase went through but they received their coins yesterday and it says ineligible on the referral report.

That's not true, I've invited two people who bought $100 worth and it says they are both ineligible. Kind of confused as to why.

Interesting, might want to contact Elias to update the CoinFIRM guide. Also I would love to see a picture of one of your 67's.

The 2011 series 1 pulls a pretty steep premium due to Numismatics loving error coins. The series 2 although there are less (~5100 series 1, 434 series 2) goes for around 2.8 BTC graded at MS65 compared to the 4-4.2 for an MS65 series 1.

You go to your name in the upper right hand corner, click advanced in the drop down, then the reports tab, then + New Report and choose referrals history  for the type of report and it will email it in excel format as well as be available in the reports tab.
I have also invited two people who bought $100 worth and it says that they are both ineligible which is awkward because I told them I would give them $50 of the $75 referral bonus as an incentive to get into Bitcoin... Nice first impression.

He does an amazing job of positively describing the benefits of Bitcoin in comparison to the current financial climate and I love his use of real world examples. 
He is obviously only trying to give a brief introduction to the technology and not go too far in depth. I'm definitely adding this to my "Bitcoin 101" videos list.

Love the idea behind this. It might not actually be a million dollars but it is amazing to see people realize how simple and convenient Bitcoin is when there are issues with Paypal every drawing. That's why I always donate directly to their Bitcoin wallet!

You've probably seen this before but: Never invest more than you are willing to lose. I think the best example of how to "invest" in Bitcoin is to compare it to purchasing a lottery ticket. You should not expect an insane return on investment (or even a positive one), and you should also not be overly upset if what you invest becomes a sunk cost.
That being said, I invest 20% of my paycheck every month into Bitcoin. I purchase the same time every month but sometimes I buy large amounts and frequently day trade to keep my cost average as low as possible. Due to the volatility of the market, I make one to two trades a month by paying attention to the whaleclub, and generally staying on top of news in the Bitcoin space.  
I am in college and do not have much to diversify so I don't have the best advice in regards to diversifying (there are other subreddits and websites that can give much better advice on that) but I think if you are just attempting to acquire Bitcoins and don't have the time to actively trade, buying a specified amount the same time every month would be the way to go rather than trying to time the market, you will most likely pick wrong unless you are an experienced trader. 
If you are looking for something high risk, but possibly high reward, Bitcoin might be what you're looking for, but I would do a significant amount of research before spending a single dollar. Don't take my word for it and remember: no matter how confident someone seems, no one can see the future and you must trade your own conscience. 
TL;DR sell your house and everything you own, acquire bitcoin. Hodl.

Honestly make an account on bitcointalk and post a [WTB] thread to this board:
They're pretty hard to find but if you wait a while they pop up every now and then. Or if you're in a rush to get one and willing to pay a premium I'm sure someone would be willing to sell.

An actual quote from them three months ago in New York:
"Prior to that, Tyler had said, in regards to how long it will be before the exchange will be approved by the government, “We feel like it's weeks. [...] We do feel like we're on the two yard line.” He made sure to walk that statement back some, saying it could be his “famous last words.”

OP is stating that miners would not keep investing in more mining equipment (to raise the hashrate) if it wasn't still profitable for them. The validity of that statement is arguable, just explaining his perspective.

Personal preference but I don't care for blockchain wallets. I would say if you're just starting out Coinbase or circle are a good place to start in regard to being a one stop shot for buying and storing coins and keeps things simple. If you start to accumulate a decent amount do some research into making paper wallets or investing in a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger. Best of luck and welcome!

Perhaps, I would say it's pretty ambiguous. I know that I constantly bring up Bitcoin whenever possible and most people try and change the topic or let the conversation die out. Oh well, more and more people have been asking me to explain and are actually listening the more positive press it gets.

More like discusses the potential to buy guns, drugs, and launder money. Not impressed with Kyle's answers to any of the questions, it seemed like he did not educate himself much for this segment. He could have easily refuted the anonymity argument as well as why gone into why Bitcoin has a leg up on other cryptos due to the strength of the existing mining network. More of the same negativity, yawn. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 15:43:31
The fees go to the miners to incentivise them to keep mining, which in turn keeps the Bitcoin network secure. They already get a reward of 25 BTC for each block they mine, but this reward halves every 4 years. The plan is that as the block reward diminishes over the time, it will be replaced by transaction fees. You don't have to include a transaction fee, but the ones that do include a fee will be prioritized by the miners so your transaction could take a while to process.

I started purchasing coin after a friend introduced me to the whitepaper and after researching for months to make sure it wasn't a scam and wrapping my head around the significance of what it was I finally purchased a coin. I began purchasing in small amounts but before long I realized just how much of my monthly income I was spending away frivolously on eating out and going out with friends. It has forced me to begin following a budget because of the mentality that I am investing in something that could one day be valuable. It was difficult before to think long term about saving and planning for my future but Bitcoin has piqued my interest in a way that allows me to set aside money without feeling like I am missing out on things I could have purchased with it otherwise. 
Through trading I have slowly been building my coin holdings to weather the ups and downs of the market and it has made me realize that I have an obsession with trading and finance. I have learned so much due to Bitcoin and whether it takes off to the moon or crashes, it was money that would have been spent with nothing to show for it anyway. 
I didn't invest more than I could afford to lose and I have gained a passion that I can see developing into a future career, I would say that's moon enough for me. Long term hodl gentlemen, let's see where this roller coaster takes us.

Your valuation of 1.5x face value is close to what some have sold for in the past but 3x is pretty absurd. Also there are ~226 10 BTC silver with gold trim coins still active (unredeemed). Not commenting on any of the other numbers as they're obviously speculation and opinion. As a long term holder and Casascius collector I hope you're right!
