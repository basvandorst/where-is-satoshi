Because everyone else sold and moved on with their lives after realizing shits over as an investment. Still good for buying prescriptions from Russia though.

I'm still up nearly 500% but I sold everything but $100 worth back in December.

Bitcoin continues to lose value, for someone in debt it just makes their financial situation worse. It's not a good investment and people with debt shouldn't be investing until they are out of it.

I sold when Jose Canseco talked about Block chain on Twitter. Made a good deal of cash and paid off medical bills.

Not sure how you would get out of debt making decisions like this. It's almost like putting 10% of your check in lotto tickets, but with worse odds.

Probably just trying to save people money. It's hard to watch people ejected from a flaming car crash crawl back into it.

But he is buying high and selling low, he just doesn't know it yet.

Realizing Bitcoin isn't a store of value and is essentially worthless. It was a niche currency for making purchases online, why people thought otherwise and kept dumping money into it is beyond me. Smart people saw that happening and took all the money. Now you just have people slowly giving up and cutting their losses. I'm guessing it will settle around $300.

Sure, so why is everyone in here concerned with the price and trying to make money off it?

Well at 300 the speed and fees will probably be usable again. I miss buying stuff with Bitcoin.

Why on Earth would it increase in value at this point? The hype bubble popped, it's not a store of value. There isn't a single reason it should even be at 3k except for delusional people hoping for the best. Wonder how many people are buying for the first time now? About 1,000. They are all buying less than $300 worth to purchase drugs.

But you can't get rich if you don't lose all of your money...I think that is the lesson here.

Letting an investment drop by 95% and not selling is the logic that is fucked. If you bought stock in Sears 20 years ago would you still not sell it?
