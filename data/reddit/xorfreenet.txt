A Freenet developer here. Yes it is is 
It would be totally awesome if OpenBazaar used Freenet.
IMHO, Freenet is a better foundation for new services than Tor or I2P. Tor and I2P both sort of aim at fixing the existing, centralized model of having a big server somewhere which handles everything: They try to make a *single* exit point anonymous. While it is really nice to allow people to access existing Internet services in an anonymous way, this cannot be as secure as a truly decentralized solution where there is no *single* exit point but many.
And thats where Freenet is a possible solution: In Freenet, not the machine hosting the data is the "exit point", but the data *itself*. That means that a Freenet address points to the data, not to the server. Each Freenet user automatically is a "small" server, and Freenet hosts the data on the machines of the users. If data is popular, it gets distributed to more machines automatically. So it doesn't matter if a single machine dies! The data will stay available.
I think its obvious that this is a more strong security model. So given that OpenBazaar is a new project, it doesn't have to go for the existing model of central servers, and it would be nice if it went for Freenet :)
(This does not aim to offend Tor/I2P developers: Putting existing software to more use is a good idea, and a benefit to everyone. But it doesn't mean that new software should use the same technical model, this would only lock it down to the limited ability of a model for making old software work in an anonymous way)
Also, we can offer lots of libraries which would make the work of OpenBazaar easier: There already *is* a system for rating they trustworthyness of users (Web Of Trust). There *is* a system for private messaging / private data traffic (Freemail). And also, we already have forum systems, which IMHO are almost the same as a market: A thread = a product offer. A thread reply = a bid. So technically, OpenBazaar devs wouldn't have to re-invent the whole thing as they probably have to with Tor / I2P.
See  for sub-projects of Freenet.
**TL;DR**: In my personal opinion, Freenet is the better technical solution for OpenBazaar than Tor/I2P because Tor/I2P are aimed at making legacy software anonymous, and thus take tradeoffs in security / decentralization. Also, the existing Freenet libraries cover huge parts of what OpenBazaar needs anyway (trust management / communication).
**By the way: We also accept Bitcoin donations :)**

**TL;DR 1 - Symbiosis between my employer and Bitcoin** I'm programmer for an anonymous P2P network which has been in development for 14 years - [Freenet]( A decentralized currency needs a decentralized communication platform, so Bitcoin and Freenet can support each other. Thus we're happy and thankful that Bitcoin donations currently allow to fund two developers. Also, it's exciting to see the concept of decentralized systems being pushed into the focus it needs by Bitcoin. Bitcoin will provide interesting technical possibilities for Freenet, such as preventing the [Sybil attack]( on anonymity. In turn, Freenet probably will adopt one of its existing implementations of forum systems to become an anonymous tradehub with Bitcoin as currency. In fact you could use the forums for that now already, they're just lacking features specific to market places such as rating buyers/sellers or product images.
Still, we are honestly a little bit sad that as a project of 14 years don't get as much attention as some recent new networks which try to re-invent the wheel which we already got rolling :| - but you can change that by having a look at Freenet :)
 I've once done a write-up to explain what Freenet can do to redditors and ask for people to support us - I'll paste that below so you have something formatted in reddit-style to read:
**TL;DR 2 - What Freenet can actually do** [Freenet]( is an anonymous, censorship-resistant sub-network of the Internet which has been in development for 14 years. It has implementations of all regular Internet services - Websites, E-Mail, Forums, Social networking, blogging, distributed search, downloads. It has about 14000 users. As it is a peer-to-peer network, you can help improve its performance just by installing it. The better the performance, the better the user experience, the more donations the foundation gets. If Freenet gets enough donations, we might be able to fund a second developer - me. So you only have to invest 5 minutes for installing it to help fund-raising, you don't have to donate money on your own.
**Will I get sued for running Freenet?** No. The way it works was designed to prevent that: You donate any amount of disk space on your hard disk and some of your Internet bandwidth. Your hard disk is used to store the content of the network. Anything which is stored there is encrypted so you cannot access it yourself. Because you cannot access what you store, you are not legally liable for it. 
**Why use Freenet and not Tor?** As all content is stored distributed on the machines of the users, Freenet is a truly self-contained and especially decentralized network. This is an improvement over Tor: It still is a centralized system with a single point of failure - if server of the websites you try to access with Tor is confiscated then the content is gone. There is no such thing as a central server in Freenet, the content is duplicated on many machines. Also, content cannot be deleted by anyone, even the author cannot delete it. It will only be deleted if the total storage space of Freenet is not enough. The least used content will be deleted then. The most used content automatically gets stored on more machines so it is more robust against censorship.
Also, this is why you can help Freenet by installing it: The more people donate disk space, the more duplicates of popular content are available, the faster people can download it.
**Why is it anonymous?** All traffic is routed through multiple machines and none of them tells the next one who originally sent the request. The connections are encrypted so it cannot be monitored from the outside.
**What can Freenet do?** We have anonymous implementations for:
* Websites: They are called Freesites on Freenet and can be used with a browser just like on the regular Internet. They are supported natively by Freenet when you install it.
* Search with the "Library" plugin
* Forums: Also can be used with a browser via "FMS" (Freenet message system). A more easy o use implementation might be finished by my work.
* E-Mail via the "Freemail" plugin. Notably better than using GnuPG and regular mail: With Freemail not only the content is encrypted - its not even visible that two users are communicating.
* Blogs via the "FlogHelper" plugin
* Social networking with the "Sone" plugin
* Chat with the "FLIP" plugin
* Distributed version control with "Infocalypse". This someday might allow Freenet development to be done via Freenet itself - all developers could become anonymous. This will be very useful to protect Freenet from legal repercussions.
**Why does Freenet need a second developer?** Matthew Toseland has been working on the core of Freenet as a paid developer for 10 years. While he is very reliable and has done a great job with the core of Freenet, the amount of subsystems has become too large for him to maintain them all. Most plugins which I told you about above are NOT shipped by default because they are not well-polished. This is a huge disadvantage to the user experience and we want to fix it. I would really like to do this job full time but for that Freenet needs more donations. The first step in getting more donations is getting more users so install it and spread the word. 
**Anything else important?** I am annoyed by the fact that the Internet is constantly discussing censorship and surveillance while the technology to prevent them has been in development for 13 years. I would be really happy if people just started using it :)
THANK YOU!
