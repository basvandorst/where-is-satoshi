Damn my neighbors for spreading lies about me about town for assuming I fuck them goats each night simply by them seeing me leave the barn each morning.
Next thing, the town's going to believe that I'm the head of Bitcoin since I blessed Bitcoinica to an acquaintance at a restaurant I used to frequent, whereupon he invested $10K and lost, assuming I'm the one who stole it. Actually, the latter is true, whereas the former was sarcasm.

Just one page. Some main donation page already in place would suffice. BTW, the offer still stands from Bitcoin 100. It will donate $1,000 via BTC once such a bitcoin donation option is in place.
You've already witnessed first-hand how easily you were able to garner $11K+ USD via BTC. It's not outside the realm of possibility for Wikipedia to amass 10X's that amount within a relatively short period of time. A source of revenue over and beyond what's already donated to your coffer on a regular basis.
On one page with just one Bitcoin donation button, and $100,000 could easily be had.
The only suggestion I would like you to consider is to use BitPay. I like them guys, having no other connection with them. Give Tony a call.

I just took the time to read all the comments to date to see if a certain concern had been addressed, opting to not search the page.
Sadly, it had not, but at least I was amused with all the softball questions that I can't help myself from thinking some were contrived beforehand to control the narrative.
KnC Miner.
KnC Miner and The Bitcoin Foundation are on record in stating that the former paid the $100K USD fee to become a Platinum Member of TBF. TBF ONLY accepts memberships fees via a dedicated bitcoin wallet address, but said fee amount is nowhere to be found.
In spite of all the scuttlebutt on BitcoinTalk, TBF had yet to address concerns about said payment, in spite of such being an important issue at the time due to now/then KnC gaining unique voting rights for the then upcoming elections for vacated board seats in which Bobby Lee and Brock Pierce won.
Question: Where's the proof that KnC Miner truly did pay for their Platinum Member to join The Bitcoin Foundation, given that such is no state secret because bitcoins were supposed to be used and full-transparency is what TBF adheres to?

All three lived in a 12,616-square-foot mansion in Encino, drove a Ferrari and a Lamborghini, wore Armani suits, took spur-of-the-moment vacations to the tropics and threw parties that attracted a young, hip crowd that also defined DEN's target audience."

Tweeted in exactly 256 tweets (think SHA-256).
I would've completed it yesterday, but BCT went down where I had the tweets formatted and stored for easy migration. Thanks to Google cache, the task was somewhat easier to complete, not wanting to wait for BCT to come back online, let alone not knowing if the files would even still be available.
My second attempt in tweeting a renown work in chronological order was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech:  That was accomplished in exactly 86 tweets to commemorate Dr. King's 86th birthday and published on January 15, 2015, his actual birthday to coincide with the upcoming, now passed, Martin Luther King Day.
My first attempt in tweeting a renown work in chronological order was Marc Andreessen's recent infamous 26 tweets, now as its own standalone piece of art: 
As far as I'm aware, my latest work is the first time any technical paper has ever been tweeted, let alone chronologically, grammatically correct, and with properly placed accompanied images.
Obviously, the bitcoin wallet address in the bio is bogus, but I hope to soon replace it with one provided to me from 
I used the copy of Satoshi's white paper found on the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute website, double checking with the original pdf to be as true as possible to the original work during the reformatting process, taking very little liberties so that the final piece of art would, again, favor the original.
Originally, the plans were to tweet the white paper in exactly 180 tweets, but about halfway though the reformatting process I came to the realization that that would be an impossibility, even mathematically, given tweets are restricted to only 140 characters. In fact, at first, I made the mistake thinking that tweets consisted of 144 characters (temporary brainfart), and had to not only go back and adjust what I have already completed, but do the same for the I Have a Dream Twitter account. Of course, Marc's 26 tweets was a no-brainer, but still took some time in creating the account, e.g., presenting a pleasant theme reminiscence of Mr. Andreessen's verified account:

In RAID 1+0, or RAID 10, the drives in the array is mirrored first (RAID 1) and then striped (RAID 0). This provides a better fault tolerance than RAID (0+1). At least 4 drives is needed.
1.  Data is first transmitted to RAID controller
2.  Then, the data is written to "array 1" and is then mirrored to "array 2"
3.  Then, "array 1" and "array 2" is striped onto "array 3" and "array 4"
RAID 10 can survive multiple drive failure, as long as the drive failure is in different sets.
The disadvantage here is storage capacity is halved, due to mirroring.

Rumor has it that Winklevii is taking over the task with a hundred-billion-dollar fix that'll be amended to their Gemini exchange acting in whole as a GPT (Gemini Pass Through). The idea came to them while attending Burning Man, realizing then that there's a huge universe of cryptocoiners ordering hardware from rogue entities even after they've been forewarned.
Just a little humor to lighten up my sorrow that BCT is down, and soon maybe Sandwich, IL, for power lines are sagging due to the weight of the snow, with the lights already flickering. What's worse is that if I go down, my fanbase suffers as well. (Note to self: Figure out where Reddit hides the smiley thingies.)

Last year or so when the site went down, we lost the ability to upload or change avatars. Recently, we lost the ability to do a search on the forum. Maybe when BCT comes back online we won't be able to sent or receive PMs. Next week, we may be limited to only 1K of data per post.
Meanwhile, a limb just broke in my front yard taking down the obsolete telephone line. The neighbor next door has a limb sagging badly on her power line. The squirrels are running into snow drifts, whereupon realizing they're screwed, they dig themselves out and return down the path they came. I just shoveled 8" of snow in the past two plus hours, to return to two inches of snow of where I started shoveling.

Wow! A proclaimed expect on Ponzi schemes couldn't definitely state that Bitcoin isn't a Ponzi scheme. Also, just prior to that comment, Chilton shows off his math skills by stating the Bitcoin exchange rate dropped 30%, from $140 to $110. At least he paid attention--probably with fiat--in subtraction class, but was probably napping during the percentages and multiplying classes.

You, my friend, don't have a clue. I'm probably one of the few bitcoiners that could be fully trusted.
As seen in the post below this by Rassah, I gave up Bitcoin100 and am working with them for a smooth transition, with myself being part of it in a lesser capacity.
Rassah, who I believe is a very trusty guy, takes care of all the money transactions, with me not being able to touch a single satoshi, as intended when I set it up to show trust.
I believe you owe me an apology.

I bet it's not a crime if you sell them a blanket. Asking price? One satoshi, or one penny (cent), which ever they happen to have on them.
Also, what if it was a loan? You're loaning them a blanket to be returned later, taking them at their word, which is more than you can say about some politicians.
Or, what if the blankets were in a garbage can the day before garbage day? Is it a crime for some guy to go into the garbage and pull out a blanket?
Or, what if the guy is on your property and he was paid with a blanket for doing some work, say picking up an empty coke can recently placed on the ground, then properly disposing it? It fact, you paid him a penny for work, then he purchased the blanket.

I like theymos, though I give him shit sometimes, mainly to keep him on his toes. That said, I received a phone call last night, and the entire conversation was about theymos and BT.
In a nutshell, the caller expressed a scenario where what if theymos is on the list of purchasing drugs off Silkroad, wouldn't it be to his best interest to shutdown BT and take all them bitcoins on account, leaving the country to become neighbors with Davinci?

After the 50 BTC bounty is paid out once you're convinced how the hack was done, what are you offering to have it fixed since that too would be beyond your skill set.
If I offered $10 to anybody that can tell me what's wrong with my car, I'm sure it's worth $100, ten times the amount, for a skilled person to fix it, otherwise I would have been able to diagnose the problem and should be able to fix it myself unless I need special tools.
Surely, the site wouldn't go live again after the government shutdown is over, for that would be a very, very strange coincidence.

I received your emails, and the last design should be fine.
Faysal's trip has been delayed one day due to weather, which may give you a little more time.
Is there any way you can stop by the hotel and rap with him briefly to make sure he's taking the flag? A quick photo would also be appreciated.
Please respect Faysal's time, for I'm sure he's a busy guy and may not have time to meet up with every Tom, Dick and Harry, but he may take a quick second to rap with a fellow Bitcoiner.

All I ask is enough time leeway to make sure I have what I believe would work in stock before you arrive.
