if bitcoin becomes supported, google wallet will be country agnostic. at least the bitcoin part of it would be.

You could try Vault of Satoshi. My experience with them has been great.

what does barter have to do with mining though? theres no exchange taking place.
is it price when mined or price when i file?
[edit] according to this article, the CRA has yet to issue any guidance on mined coins
"CRA’s positions on these issues are set out here and in CRA Document No. 2013-0514701I7 “Bitcoins” (December 23, 2013). Unfortunately for Bitcoin miners, CRA does not provide any guidance on whether producing Bitcoins through mining constitutes earning income."
