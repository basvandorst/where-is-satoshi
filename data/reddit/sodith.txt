look at the price of bitcoin at the crash after the crash in late 2013.. 
It didn't go up as well
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:06:45
agreed. And stop this "to the moon" posts when we pump the price to 250$...
much rather I would like to see 2% growth steps which are fundamental...

1 Neptun consums about 2200 watts.
So you would need at least 27 (more likely  &gt;30) of these 100watts panels got get the power.
The problem is you will only be able to run 1 miner for about 4-6 hours per day if you are lucky and you are living in a very sunny area. On top if the (27*180$) 4500$ Solar Panels you need an big 12v Converter and a good battery pack for buffering the system in the peak times because of possible clouds.
In the end you will spend over 5000$ to save about 2-3$ per day... ( if you have something like 0.20$ per kwh) 
assuming you have perfect sunny weather every day in the year it would take over 5 years for the system to Amortization and therefore pay itself... 
And since you won't have 365 perfect sun it's a waste of money in the end...
Thought you are doing nature a favorer by not burning coal electricity...

there is nothing wrong with Blockchain.info....
could you guys give me anything that indicates blockchain.info is stealing anything?
I am pretty sure 99,99% of btc losing via Blockchain.info is user failure ..

People don't want believe it when talking bad about price/Bitcoin. But they will experience it. This subred is immune to critics.

mycelium entropy would be the product we need. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:24:13
well, it is actually very likely that we will break the old 170$ low and find us in a free fall into double digits. 
At least many trader with experience expect this.
so be careful. We can easily get into another big panic before creating a real bottom.
@_date: 2015-01-21 12:26:42
we have to reach a point where almost nobody is left that is willing to sell at a profit. I know some people bought between 100 -200 $ back in late 2013 and still holding their coins in a cold store. More and more of them are deciding to sell as it gets to a point where they would lose money. On top there are a lot of people selling at a lose + 3600 coins mined every day. 
--&gt; That means we will stay bearish until the last people can sell at a profit. Once we see a panic sell with a free fall to 100$ or even bellow we will likely shake out all the people with doubts if or if not they want to sell. (called getting ride of weak hands)
Once we reached this point we can likely see a revers, because it is creating an Selling bubble (opposite of what we have seen) a lot of money is waiting on the exchanges to be spend as a lot of people expect an even lower price. So we will see the start of the next bubble.
 
Even thought there are a lot of good news in the bitcoin. Trading is almost pure psychology. it's most often smart to behave the opposite of what your mind is telling you.

They don't even have access to your wallet. You can use Blockchain.info without any Internet connection if you are super paranoid.
well it's pretty simple why so many people lose their money stored on Blockchain.info:
-You can download your wallet pretty easy. They even provide Dropbox what is really stupid. So 2-W authentication doesn't work anymore.
-People import Wallets from other compromised systems or Sites where the admins actually have full control of the wallet and privat keys.
-There were many Pushing sites for Blockchain.info. They looked 100% the same as the original. As an normal person you wouldn't even notice the difference. They even appeared high on google search for a time if I remember correctly.
and yes I agree if you are not careful and have a basic understanding of security Blockchain.info is not advisable.
But if you know what you are doing Blockchain.info is actually the best webwallet to use....

if you don't care about the price and don't want the stress of daytrading they are super high... like 0,02% to 0,1% per day....
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:02:18
well, you have to keep in mind that most of the pump to 1200$ was done by the willy bot on Mt.Gox. I don't think it's very likely we will reach this price soon again.
We would need a global currency crises and some luck to make Bitcoin explode and going to the moon.

get to another computer change your password.
btc-e has the option to lock all withdraws for a few days. Or just transfer your coins to a paper wallet for the moment.
Next step: 
Use a linux live cd and back up all your personal data from your hard drive and format your Hard drives and reinstall windows.
You can also use the Linux live cd to change all the passwords you have just to be extra sure.
as an advice just download an Xubuntu or Ubunti .img from their side an burn it on cd / usb and start your computer from it. You can almost be 100% sure nobody will get the new passwords as long as you are on the live cd.

well, it's getting pumped yes.. if it would really rise it would be able to stay above a certain level. Which bitcoin has never been able to... It's all driven by people who are already in bitcoin, they simply all go long and we reach a certain level because people FOMO thinking we will shoot up to 35k$ per bitcoin over night... But when everybody is long and nobody is willing to really hold bitcoin when it is falling we dump like crazy again...
absolutely the same story recently... We pumped as hard as we could to get to 312$ very fast... We had Greece bank system closed AND China stocks hard core crashing...
What happened once China and Greece settled down? Yes we dumped again and now we are at the edge of a cliff to sub 200$. It was purely speculative driven by the "hodl Bitcoin believers"... If there really would have been new money rolling in we would safety stay at 280-300 or even above 300$ but the flash crash on bitfinex is a perfect representation of the current mindset. Everybody is caught at a (margin)Long position they desperately want to close. Way too many people are still long on bfx at least. They all hope for the moon and they all have a margin call price...
We are going to crash further to a point where even the hard core "My btc are safe on the paper Wallet" Guys are starting to accelerate the dump... As long as there are no million of $ flooding in soon I would say it's a likely outcome...
Bitcoin is still in the bubble phase from the 1200$ highs...
Maybe we really have to dive sub 100$ to find a bottom... I am constantly shorting this since 300$ and it's doing great... But the markets statistics still behave like we would be in a bull market which we are defiantly not ... We should at least have one or two bigger long squeezes to make the market a bit more rational again...
@_date: 2015-08-24 07:27:01
it's funny how the Bitcoin price falls as well when the global markets are falling...
But hey this sub is the total wrong place if you want to have a discussion about that.... It's all about to the moon and hodl for almost 2 years now. And Yet look at the price development in the last 2 years
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:19:51
this is defiantly the wrong place to ask this kind of question. This is the most pro Bitcoin place you can possibly get to...
@_date: 2015-08-19 10:49:46
major crisis? That's actually good news.
@_date: 2015-08-09 18:00:54
there is no reason for Bitcoin to become bigger then the Google Market Cap, there are is not even a trustworth exchange backed by anything to pump billions into... And you would need big Fonds and Banks to buy into to drive the market cap from current 4Billion to 400 Billion to see 100x return...
Banks are not going to buy Bitcoin because of that. They have their Bailout secured Trillion Trillion $ Playground already...
@_date: 2015-08-09 14:02:30










exactly. This is the wrong place to ask these questions.
Just watch how everybody had a boner and was posting Moon Pictures all day when we clearly peaked again at 315$...
If you want somebody to pet you because you saved 50 cent on your last transaction or You just saw a Bitcoin license plate...
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:16:30

@_date: 2015-08-14 13:02:24
Okay so if I need a Bank in order to use Bitcoin why would I use bitcoin over any other traditional system in the first place?
Okay why would anybody without an Bank account want to buy an apple product or even an airline ticket if he needs a Bank in order to get the transaction with possible chargebacks?
lol... wtf... Make absolutely no sense to me tbh.. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 13:36:32
Don't follow too much what people say in this sub. Almost all of them are blindly in love with the idea Bitcoin will become the Internet of money. Surely Bitcoin will have another bubble, the problem is nobody knows if we will go up to 1000$ per bitcoin ever again... Maybe the next bubble will start from 20$ and peak at 300$ in 5 years? Nobody knows.
In the End Bitcoin is nothing else as a PennyStock... (Bitcoin Market Cap is 1/400 of the Apple Stock Market Cap.)
You buy it very low with the hope of 10x return in the end.
The Problem is Bitcoin had it's sub 1$ phase long time ago... Currently it's like buying a stock of a former penny stock company which has had it's moon peak time almost 2 years ago.
Can it go up again? Sure, but don't expect the 100x return this time... You are simply too late for such an outcome...
All in all I am currently suggesting my Friend / Family not to invest much money into bitcoin... The Risk reward is just not worth it.. 
The current price is almost pure Speculation driven... There is almost no demand for Bitcoin to use them for several reasons currently.

once you know basic programming C++ ... You also know Python and Java, they are very similar. In the end C++ is the most basic and on the hardware side fastest programming language.
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:09:35
in the end it's even more secure to use Blockchain.info when enabling the second password to send founds. It's much handier and you can access it from everywhere.
Well on the other Hand if you have a Keylogger on your computer because you followed a link / downloaded something strange you lose your money in your local wallet as well.... 
While on Blockchain.info you have several things to prevent somebody stealing your money once they are used... 2-way authentication, Second password for sending money, IP-whitelists etc.. You don't have these things on a local-Wallet.
I don't understand why reddit hates so much on Blockchain.info. Everytime I read about somebody losing money is because they followed a stupid E-Mail link to a pishing site plus not using any additional security features beside a simple password. On top there even more people I feel losing their money on a local wallet because they accidentally deleted their wallet somehow or even have a keylogger on the computer.
I would say Blockchain.info is a great wallet you can suggest even very new Users. You just have to explain them basic security and tell them to print out the privat key which Blockchain.info offers as well simple and easy.
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:56:52
well what do you expect... 10c is super low. The Bitcoin transaction fee has also to increase at some point so we can keep the blockchain stable. Nothing is for free in this world.

Cryptowat is much faster then Bitcoinwisdom. Wisdom has like 2-3 seconds delay compared to cryptowat.
On top the candles are better printed on Cryptowat compared to BW, especially on Chinese exchange without anorderbook.
just get used to Cryptowat it and forget about Bitcoinwisdom.
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:54:58
well, if you would know how Blockchain.info works you would know everything is beeing computed and scripted on your local browser and not on the Blockchain.info sever...
They just store the encrypted container. So Blockchain.info is even safer then a local app if you use a second password for sending money on Blockchain.info. There is really no reason against Blockchain.info it's just conspiracy by reddit not understanding BC.info
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:11:40
I don't understand why people down-vote the Bitcoin talk show... It's actually pretty good.
