Anybody else view the price movement as their personalities? Like I’ll be looking at it going “oh tron, at it again” 
I think I have spent too much time with these cryptos

It also says payment invalid

We should have a fund for people that go above and beyond for the community
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:48:27
You are in it now. See it till the end. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:05:23
I have WiFi and cellular data 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:02:43
Wonder how much that notepad would be now
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:23:05
Well. I stand corrected 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:40:43
That makes alot of sense. How would you know if such an event took place?(Exodus) Aside from reddit 
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:05:18
I'm also thinking about getting ledger nano for a more secure wallet. Any objections? Or better methods for the same price ~$50 
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:43:08
So would my best course of action be to get a hardware wallet like the ledger? 
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:12:16
I'm definitely going to look into hardware. Coinbase offers two types of vaults currently I'm using the coinbase vault where coinbase doesn't know your private key. At least that's what they say. What's your take on it?? 
@_date: 2016-12-23 14:04:41
If I did have a problem, is there a way to contact them? 
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:15:31
Anything wrong with buying the BTC on coinbase and transferring them somewhere safer? 
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:03:31
The number of daily transactions and wallets is more important than just the price. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:03:47
Have you had any trouble transferring your BTC from coinbase to different wallets? My biggest fear is losing it during the transfer. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:11:33
Inflation is the biggest robber 
@_date: 2016-12-26 13:49:19
Please explain what it is, if it's not data being sent that says I own these bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:05:55
Could we taper down the difficulty so it doesn't require as much to mine? 
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:22:47
By knowing markets go through cycles and having acquired all 7 dragon balls in my nut sack 
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:05:16
How much are they and how would I get started? 
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:35:27
I'm not really looking for cash profits but to accumulate BTC. I dont understand how I get nothing, wouldn't I get a portion of BTC from that block? I'm very new to mining 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:00:55
When the fuck was that? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:27:32
“Experts” my ass 
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:42:40
I'm not looking for cash profits, more to accumulate BTC 
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:45:32
What if you dont remove the WiFi card? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:22:44
Is nice hash still solo mining? What's different about it? 
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:27:55
Fuck so how do I keep my coins that arent supported by ledger safe? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:57:04
Thank you all. I gotta get all the basics down
