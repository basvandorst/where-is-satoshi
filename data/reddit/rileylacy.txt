Okay, that's understandable. That probably is what happened.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:53:52
Oh okay.

Okay, that's what I figured given the instability of crypto currencies. So then, do most people just take a gamble with it?
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:15:46
Yeah, that makes sense. So then how do most people get into it? A little at a time as the above commenter suggested, or something else?

Okay thanks, that's good to hear. What about if I transfer them back into USD onto my debit card? Or, my USD Wallet, I don't know if I could put the money back onto my card.

Okay, I didn't even know what day trading was until now lol. That is some great advice though, I think I'll end up doing that.

Hmm, I'm not sure. You very well could be right, but it does have 100,000+ downloads and 4.8/5 rating on Google Play, so I don't know. I guess I'll find out. I mean, it definitely does drain battery, but it could also be because I'm leaving my screen on all the time now.

Okay, that makes sense. Currently I'm using an app on Android to mine Bitcoin. It's a slow process, 2 to 4 KH/s, but I get more for watching ads for the developer. I think it's nice for now just so I don't have to risk any of my money with it atm.

Possibly, but I don't have to charge my phone much more often, and I'm getting the majority of the Bitcoins from watching ads, so I think, that combined with the efficiency of having a modern phone with modern specs, will combat that. I've made about .0025 BTC in a few days, so I don't think it's too bad. I'm 18, still living with my mom btw.

Calling me stupid doesn't help, I was asking for advise. I understand that you can't time the highs and lows, I was just bringing up some points. Okay.
