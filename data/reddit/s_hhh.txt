Everyone that's waited (including my friends) have waited since 4k, 5k, 7800, etc. If you wait on the drop it could be up to 13k and you're wondering what happened. CME is happening in 14 days. It could take off or it could drop. It's your call. Red or Black on the roulette wheel.

Well said. Do you think Bitcoin is effective as a currency which is what it was intended given the delays, fees, mining requirements, etc. ? If not, do you think it will / can be?

Up it to 1 BTC and save it and you'll see what happens.

No one is worried about it being a bubble regardless of history and the insane spike that doesn't equal its ability? 
I could be more on board with it if it actually worked well, but even with high fees the transactions take forever, and one Bitcoin transaction uses enough power to power a house for a week.  The only thing bitcoin has going for it now is fame and rarity but that wasn't its original intention.
There's going to be a lot of really sad people if and when it pops. Nothing in history has gone up like this that didn't come crashing down. I've liquidated all my crypto and will just watch for a while now. May the odds be ever in your favor.

Because more are holding what they have instead of selling.

Since you have only $10 in BTC it really doesn't matter what you do or don't do. Not being snarky, but I doubt $10 is worth your time looking into it. It really comes down to how you value your time. If you think your time is worth $100 an hour, then you should only spend 6 minutes of your time figuring out what to do.

People should think with their brain and not their nuts. $500 profit per day is great for many people so I don't blame them.

The volume can't sustain this. It shouldn't be this high so I hope if you're in you're not surprised by a massive correction coming soon.

When it reaches full potential as you listed it'd make sense for it to go to 20k. Right now it's simply not sound. And all the moonbabies will flip out when it corrects being totally surprised after downvoting everyone that says anything other than positives.

So what you're saying is if it goes down, it could go down further, but it could also go up. Very observative indeed.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:12:35
And those periods had corrections as well. Sure it went back up but this recent spike with low volume will fall. And sure it'll go back up again but don't be surprised when it does fall.

For the other party to actually receive it took 6 confirmations.

Care to elaborate why you shouldn't keep your BTC in your Coinbase account when the fork happens?

I want it to go up as much as everyone else here, but it doesn't take a genius to realize this is inflated. Just be careful, please. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:04:33
I paid a substantial fee which gave something like 99.6% confidence. Still took an hour to complete.

It's going the wrong direction... I didn't see any news that could've sparked the sudden drop. Anyone aware of anything?
