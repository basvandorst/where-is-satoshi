Yes. Very few people on the planet have, or will ever have, a whole bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-23 19:45:21
Take a nap.
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:30:09
ANYONE with the money and interest could own a 747, what's your point? 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:55:50
At the moment, yes. Stay tuned as we add more web wallet options (and after that, local wallets!)
EDIT: Correction, a Coinbase account is required to receive money, but you could still sign up and send money  using any wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:35:07
I'm one of the devs. We're still in beta and would love any feedback you have. 
Also, I'm here if you have any questions!
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:57:30
Cool story. 
In absolute numbers, yes lots have owned a whole bitcoin. In relative numbers only a tiny fraction of the planet have or will
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:06:44
Now that is a good idea. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:51:33
Not really. But I was fucking excited to share with you guys. Did I offend you?
@_date: 2014-05-16 13:55:43
I'm the lead developer. This is still an early beta product, but any feedback would be extremely appreciated. 
I'm here if you have any questions.
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:09:03
What on earth gave you the idea it's more expensive?
How can something be cheaper than free?
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:58:26
Gotta be fucking inclusive
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:24:21
Totally understand. As soon as we can incorporate stealth addresses, you will be able to use Bitfluence without needing to trust any third-party with your priv keys. 
In the meantime, we do not want to support public posting of public addresses, as it is bad privacy practice. Ideally, each address should only be used for one incoming transaction, and coinbase provides a user-friendly means of accomplishing that.
@_date: 2014-06-24 13:23:16
To a merchant using bitpay's services? The merchant can configure that themselves, and the number of confirmations they require is likely proportional to the value of the transaction. Could be anywhere from 1 to 6 confirmations.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:48:24
Agreed. In short: we have no ability to run away with your money, and neither would any hackers in the case of full server compromise. 
I've explained a bit more in other comments here, and I will try to address your concerns with clearer information in the about and coming faq.
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:53:43
Yes, it is a bit thin now. Hopefully the faq will help once its ready. In the meantime, here's some more information. This website is designed to solve a few problems:
Currently, its very easy to send bitcoin to a business. Just go to their website and click pay, and they will provide a bitcoin address for payment. But sending and receiving bitcoin as a person is not as easy. Here are the current options and the problems we see with each:
1) Post/share one bitcoin address and allow people to send money there: bad privacy practice since reusing addresses allows third parties to know which money passes through your hands. Also doesn't work if you don't have a personal website/blog on which to post that address.
2) Generate a unique address for each transaction, and then send that to whomever you are expected payment from. Good privacy practice, but requires 1) requesting address 2) generating address, and 3) sending address
3) Send money within coinbase if you know the recipient's email address (or request money through coinbase if you know the sender's email address)
Using the Coinbase API, we can generate a unique address for you whenever someone visits your page, thus providing the convenience of a single posted address with the security of unique addresses. We also provide a location to post that information.
One challenge we faced was identity verification: how do you know that profile claiming to be X is actually owned by person X? If we allowed users to decide their own usernames, it would be very easy to pretend to be someone you are not. So we mandate twitter login, thus ensuring that username  on bitfluence is actually owned by user  on twitter. If you want to send money to some person, and you know their twitter, you can safely send money to that handle on bitfluence and know it will get to them (unless their twitter account has been compromised, of course).
Does this help?
@_date: 2014-12-18 05:40:51
Oh shit. I'm totally going to do this.
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:18:45
Great response. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:47:11
Indeed it does not...but it does require you to deposit funds into a tippercoin account, no? 
We believe you should not have to move funds into separate accounts, and realizing that goal at the moment means requiring Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:38:12
This will be fixed very soon! Thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:36:02
One benefit of our service is that money is never temporarily held in any sort of "twitter account", waiting to be withdrawn to a more general local/web wallet. Money sent through Bitfluence goes straight to the Coinbase account.
If your twitter account is suspended, you will actually still be able to receive payments (you just would not be able to log into Bitfluence and change your profile information), and all money sent to you is always in your Coinbase account.
@_date: 2014-05-16 16:08:44
Venmo is a service that makes sending dollars to your friends VERY easy. I don't personally use it, but it does have a solid user experience.
@_date: 2014-05-16 18:16:30
Your feeling was justified - we started off trying to help *charities* receive bitcoin, then moved into the more general problem of helping *anybody* send and receive bitcoin. The splash page picture is a relic of earlier days. A great picture no doubt, but does give an inaccurate impression. 
Thanks for the feedback! We'll try to make our splash page less confusing.
And while we're passing compliments around, congrats on winning the bithackathon. :)
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:46:46
Very nice. Can you explain how you don't have access to our private keys? 
Seems to me that any btc sent to QuickCoin would be held by you, priv keys and all.
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:18:53
Yes, this has come to my attention today and we plan to fix it as soon as possible!
Sorry about that!
@_date: 2014-06-23 03:12:11
Looks like its already been confirmed three times. :)
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:11:55
At its core, this is designed to make it easier to send bitcoin, without needing any sort of address copy-paste or qr code scanning.
Instead of sending someone an address, you would just share your  and let coinbase handle the generation of unique addresses for each transaction.
We aim to be the simplest way to connect senders and receivers, regardless of what type of wallet they use.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:05:59
Bitcoin itself will always be decentralized, but it is impossible to add additional functionality without some centralization. However we do plan on adding ways for you to use Bitfluence without needing Coinbase or any other bank.
Bitcoin will always have banks, but I totally agree that you should have the option to be your own bank.
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:30:26
Interesting. I will look into this. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:06:26
If you look at the authorization pages for both Twitter and Coinbase, you'll see that we request the bare minimum authorization needed. This means that we cannot withdraw any money whatsoever.
The pay "button" you see is entirely handled as an iframe provided by Coinbase, meaning that is directly created and controlled by them.
We use Twitter solely for identity verification, so that people who trust your twitter account can trust your bitfluence account.
In the worst case scenario where our servers were completely compromised, the absolute worse a hacker could do is re-assign their coinbase wallet to your bitfluence account, meaning that if someone tried to send money to you, it would actually go to them. And we would shut down before that could happen. :)
Even with full compromise, no one could withdraw funds from your Coinbase.

Fixed. If you update your profile, the correct characters will now appear. The error stemmed from a database misconfiguration, so the correct string was not saved previously.

Agreed. I am fairly private and do not feel the desire to publicly announce anytime I send money. With Bitfluence, you can send money without needing to tweet anything at all.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:09:56
We are currently investigating ways to add Blockchain.info and other web wallets. Coinbase just happens to supply the easiest API, and so was the first to be integrated. 
The beauty of bitcoin is that we can as many web-wallet services as we would like, with no degradation of user experience. Unlike Square and Venmo, for instance, where it is impossible to directly send money from a Square account to a Venmo one. 
Stay tuned.
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:05:25
Clarification: requiring Coinbase for the receiving end. You can still send money from any bitcoin wallet!

Yes, it is bad, from the perspective of the economy as a whole. A deflating currency leads to under-investment and less spending, while an inflating currency leads to over-investment and spending. The ideal currency would maintain static value, neither inflating nor deflating. 
In my opinion, bitcoin would be better off if the exponential supply growth flattened off to some flat x% growth per year. Since inflation also takes into account monetary velocity, this would not set the inflation to be equal to that x%, but it would mitigate the deflationary aspect of bitcoin and bring it closer to an ideal static currency.
Economics is not my profession, nor have I studied it in depth, so I am unable to explain in depth why deflation is bad, but my limited knowledge does leave me confident that it is indeed a bad thing.
One important caveat: I said it is bad for *the economy*. For an *individual*, the deflationary currency is preferred, so long as it remains the minority currency and debts/prices are not set in terms of its value. The individual is only motivated to seek his/her own benefit, so in this sense the psychology of adopting bitcoin is similar to pollution, where my uncontrolled pollution is good for me (significantly lower business costs) but bad for the collective (millions suffers a tiny amount).
