They’re gonna lose sales with these prices.

They could just as easily write articles titled “I lost all my money on the stock market.  Don’t trade the stock market”.   Crypto, just like the stock market, has to be played with due diligence and can’t just be yoloed.  If you lose it all then it’s your fault.

You don’t spend half a Bitcoin.  You spend whatever the price of a product is worth. Which as bitcoins price goes up, the amount of bitcoin a product is worth will go down.

I definitely agree. My girlfriends brother thinks he’s the shit cuz he mines bitcoin, but he also decided to buy 2 FULL bitcoin back in December at around 17k each with his moms money (the guys 21 ffs) so I’ll let him have his thunder.

What do people like you (vendors) charge for your items? I don’t understand how crypto pricing works when it’s so volatile

You’re supposed to put “Bitcoin CEO” as the first two words if you want it to work. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 05:41:06
I’m not calling anything “crazy magic money”.  But to think that everything will be tokenized is ridiculous and you’re just as ridiculous for defending your belief that it will. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 04:58:40
Says the guy that says everything will be tokenized. 
That my friend, is a silly dream.  Just focus first on getting bitcoin to take off.  I support that.  But to pretend that “everything will be tokenized” is completely ridiculous and unrealistic at this point. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 02:27:58
What the hell does that even mean? How is a share of a stock any different than a “token”?  You people are getting your hopes up over nothing. We’re not retarded. We don’t need a token “because we need a way to see things”.  Things have worked just fine these past hundred of years. 
@_date: 2019-04-13 21:49:49
In 5 years? Cmon, I’m all for replacing the dollar with crypto, but there’s no **way** that in five years enough places will accept crypto that you’ll be buying your lunch with it.

Tbh this is my first time hearing of this.  You guys both, in addition to the poster, fueled the situation and raised my knowledge of this man and now I’m probably contributing too.  What have you done!

I hope it keeps falling until I cash out my AKER stock. I want in at the low.

I believe hype alone may get AKER into the $2’s, and pairing that with their multitude of products being released this year will pull their stock price hopefully up to $4.  They have their 10 minute chlamydia test that is supposedly the fastest test on the market that provides accurate results which is pending approval to be sold over the counter.  Plus they just announced partnership with a couple of companies (too lazy to go back and read their newsletter) which should help AKER make some profit in the coming years. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:46:25
I’m waiting for the $4 price target.  I’m very confident that it will hit it before the end of the year. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:18:39
I will buy two full bitcoin as soon as I cash out on my AKER stock

I’d argue it tasted better at $20,000
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:44:28
Can it please drop back down to 6000$ for a month or two so i can get the funds to buy an actual whole bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:21:26
The stock I’m in right now is either destined to succeed valiantly or fail slowly. If it does succeed then I’ll have $10,000+ and will have well over enough to buy a bitcoin.  If I sell now tho I’ll never be able to buy a full bitcoin and that will be nearly all my trading money
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:44:54
With accurate dd you can for sure make money in the stock market.  There’s no doubt about it. The crypto market is different.  If i don’t even have enough money to buy a full bitcoin, I’m not taking all my money out of stock to put it into BTC. In the short term I KNOW that stock will make me more money. And in the long term it’s not even a guarantee that stock will make me more money. So until I have enough money to buy a full bitcoin then I will not put a significant amount of money into it. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:39:28
If I take my money out of the stock market and put it all into BTC then I’ll never have enough money to buy a bitcoin.  I’ve put in a set amount of money into stock and that’s my disposable money.  The rest is all going towards college funds.  So I know I could buy half a bitcoin rn and hope for the best to buy one later, but it’ll be well after 5+ years that I’ll have that kind of money. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:38:03
But my return on my pennystocks can be an upwards of $16,000 as early as May.  I was hoping it would come April, but still if I wait till May I’ll have enough for a full bitcoin.  I just wanted that backup price of $6000 just Incase. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:41:42
I’m somewhat new to crypto currencies.  I have a question about bitcoin.  Won’t bitcoin have to stabilize HEAVILY in order for it to be accepted as a supported currency?  If it fluctuates between $20,000 and $6,000 won’t that make it nearly impossible to use it as a form of payment?

Bitcoin is available for free?
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:16:56
The reason I ask for a dip and say I’ll buy if we wait is not because I’m being stingy and WONT buy in.  It’s because I haven’t made my goddamn return from penny stocks and if I sold my stock for BTC I CANT buy in.  I want to be able to buy a whole BTC or at least half of one.  So please go to $6000 for one month ��
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:24:30
Cuz I want a full bitcoin :(
@_date: 2018-04-07 08:24:32
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:15:01
I didn’t have $6000 at the time. If I wanted to buy in at that time I woulda only been able to put in $3000

More like how people want crypto to work.
