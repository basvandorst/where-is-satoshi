Well blood wise they're about the same, but ethics and mindset wise, quite different. Think of Taiwan as the democratic little brother of China.

Please look into his UBI in FULL detail. The VAT will be exempt from alot of consumer staples/essentials. It will impact luxury consumers primarily (ie people who purchase items such as yachts). Also you'd have to spend more than 120k a year in consumption for the UBI to not help you in anyway.

I was that person. I think you misread. I said the VAT will impact people who buy luxury goods as opposed to someone buying food.

Well simply go on a Yang video or information spree and start piecing it together lol. He isn't taxing "luxuries", I don't even know what that means. He is adding a value added tax of 10% ( half the rate of Europeans ). Most of the money generated from this will be from big tech companies ie. Amazon, Uber, Netflix, Google, Facebook, etc etc. After that he is consolidating the shitty welfare systems we have now. Add economic growth because of increased consumption-&gt;demand-&gt;jobs to local communities.
If you have time, watch a video of him that isn't like 2 or 3 minutes long and him just talking briefly. There are some really long bits of him breaking down the numbers. The great thing is, he isn't some random nutjob with a political background endorsing UBI, he's literally coming from a business entrepreneur economics background, give him SOME credit lol

Actually Yang has worked out his Math to allow the 1k. Also the point you made about people not having to work is kind of the opposite of what he stated. 1k is a good number because it is high enough where it is essentially a cushion to rebound from but not high enough to quit your job over. Welfare which I think you may be getting these vibes from cause people to work less. The reason being is welfare is stigmatized and also has a ton of bureaucracy and guidelines attached to it. If you start getting ahead and working, the welfare disappears and you may be in a worse spot than without the welfare. The UBI lets you keep and save every dollar while you work.
