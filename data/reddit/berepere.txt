this was probably said in this long thread, but I'd suggest OP think well on a list of suspects who know you, and submit it to your local police authorities. Maybe also hire  a private investigator. 
It is most likely that these people knew and knew you had a lot of coin. So it should be possible to find them. 
If the perpetrators are not found you won't get any coins back.

at the time a very popular online wallet was mybitcoin.com 
Of course it's long since gone. Forever. The only exchange was mtgox.com 
If she can find the email she used on mtgox, and the emails indiciating trade history, then perhaps a claim can still be made on kraken.com though I'm really not sure about that and how it works (those goxed can  advise perhaps)
edit: also, trying to login on bitcointalk.org and checking her post history might bring back some memories. At the time that was *the* place for bitcoin discussion. Note that a lot of old accounts have been hacked though, and are unrecoverable. But it may not be necessary to log in - just find the username and check its posts.

you are not calculating the price of the attack correctly. If the attack is unsuccessful (as happens with a probability that depends on the amount of hashing power of the attacker) then the attacker loses subsidy+fee. Check out the paper you linked to for the correct price calculation.

suddenly the community discovers that halving is a disaster! 
There are indeed some interesting and worrying consequences possible, e.g. the so-called "51% attack" becoming much cheaper, as discussed [here](
But all these problems would only arise if mining was on the edge of profitability before the halving. That is, it costs almost as much (in electricity) to mine a block as the block reward + fees. 
This is not the case and won't be the case this time around. New generation mining chips (14-16nm)  are being deployed by some and nearing deployment by others, and this once again throws off the cost balance. This is evidenced by the rapidly increasing difficulty: had the balance been reached, difficulty would be stable.
Note that at the time of the previous halving we had the same situation: the difficulty continued to increase as if nothing happened.
tl;dr Some  concerns are legitimate, but they won't be relevant for this halving, for the same reason they were not a problem the last time.

the article is missing some basic princinples of gambling.
If you are playing against a house, it needs to put some money against you. It won't put them at equal odds (0% house edge), because if it does it is guaranteed to lose everything eventually.
0% house edge is only possible if it is p2p - then there's simply no house. This, however, cannot be instant (unless one of the gambling parties accepts 0 conf and all the risks it brings), and, moreover, is not possible in bitcoing right now. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 21:47:20
I'll try to explain the "stealing" part.
Let's say the majority of miners decide to steal your coins, and you are running the (full node) client with the proposed change. 
They get all your coins (without any valid signatures) and continue mining on top of this. Your client notices this and stops recognizing the chain as valid. But, after 24 hours, your client says "Oh ok. It's been 24 hours so it's fine then. I don't have any more coins but what can I do? it's been 24 hours and the miners agree!"
@_date: 2019-03-03 06:15:55
the numbers are missing from that explanation, which makes it just look like a rant. "Oh we pay so much everywhere."  If you acutally show how much of that 9.4% fee goes where then it'd look honest.  In particular, some of those points will be easily shown to be minuscule, for example kraken exchange fees and network mining fees.
Anyway, the biggest item seems to be the first - exchange rate fees. You mention buying BTC "the day before" - is that supposed ot be taken literally? Do you place an order a day? why not an order an hour? Or just buy when a withdrawal is requested? That'd reduce your risk almost to  nothing.

@_date: 2016-06-26 08:33:43
I see the advice "buy an altcoin then convert back to bitcoin" repeated persitently over years, whereas in fact alts have nothing to do with mixing (aka tumbling) bitcoin. 
All you are doing is depositing bitcoing to a collective wallet, then withdrawing it.  The collective wallet can be an exchange, a gambling site, a dark market - anything at all. 
When you withdraw, the service in question will typically give you different bitcoins from those you deposited - because it doesn't care. 
Some exchanges now do care (directly or not), but whether they do or not is indepedent of your acitivity on the exchange (whether you buy alts or not).
also, all the darknet mixers/tumblers are scams. Some of them may just play honest while  waiting for a big deposit to pull the exit scam.

The "fork", that is, two resulting chains, is not an inevitable outcome of a "hard fork".  Look up "evil soft fork". In short: pretty much any hard fork can be done as a "soft" fork, where the legacy nodes will see the new blockchain as empty blocks only. This means that the "forked" miners still mine the legacy chain with all their hashpower, forcing legacy nodes to either update their rules, or make a "real" hard fork of their own.

The problem with this analysis is that he uses transaction volume to measure the number of users.  But the transaction volume is manipulable, and has been manipulated a lot.  What is more, as we all know, the tx volume is capped and this cap has been poked quite a lot recently. 
It'd be interesting to find a better indicator of the global number of users. But then comes the question of what is a user, the model suddenly acquires a bunch of parameters and loses its predictive power as a result.

That's not how it works. If they have a minority hash rate, they will just have slower blocks for a while. Until the difficulty adjusts. That won't be a problem as they won't have that many transactions anyway. Providing the majority does not attack them (why would it care to? it doesn't care to attack bcash, for example), they'll be fine. 
The only reason they wanted to have majority hash rate is that they wanted to be bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:55:31
It's just the cost of the hashrate to waste vs the benifit of  the token appreciating.
Besides, they are doing a hard fork, so they may just as well code a one-time difficulty decrease.

to everyone saying hodl (in different terms):
there's a thing called diversification. BTC may as well grown to 1M$, but staying &gt;95% invested in such a risky asset is not wise. 
What could go wrong with BTC, apart from a puretly speculative market crash? 
The same risk remains that was tehre in 2009: It can get replaced by some "bitcoin 2.0" that may or may not be better, and you may not see it coming. 
(No I'm not covert-shilling for any alt; I don't think any of the alts is a good contender for btc2.0 status. But the risk is there nonetheless and it's very serious)
so my advice: if there's something you can buy that would improve your life now, like: a house, then do it. If not, wait till you can do it on at most (say) 80% of yout BTC, then sell and change your life.

@_date: 2017-11-06 18:34:39
Since the "passphrase" is only 15 digits, it may be for a brain wallet. You can use the "brain wallet" tab at bitaddress.org to see if it gives you the 34-digit address that you have.
Note that you can do it offline,which may make you feel safer:  go to bitaddress.org, switch off you internet, and check if the passphrase gives the address.  If it does, copy the long string of digits in the "private key" field. Then you can close the page switch on your internet again :)  You can then import this into pretty much every bitcoin wallet. 
Now, if the passphrase is not for a brainwallet but for a locally stored wallet, then you'll need to find that wallet file. It's likely  a wallet.dat file somewhere on your 2011 machine.
Edit: also, if instead of withdrawing all your mined coins from the pool to your wallet you just kept them on the pool, then there's no hope for you. It's lost. But then why would you have that BTC address?

those blocks may be gone, but not the transactions in them (ok at that time most blocks were empty anyway).

4 Tumbling is quite easy and can be done almost for free (you only need to pay some miner fees to get transactions through). 
However, if you are buying to hold, I'd advise against tumbling. Think of it this way: when you want to sell, you will have a very easy way of proving that you did what you did: bought on a clean exchange using money from your bank account, and have been holding since. If you erase that link, then when you transfer your btc to an exchange to sell, you have no way of proving that you are not a cocaine dealer, gambler or something like that. 
So, tumble only if you think you really need it, and when you think you need it, because you are destroying a link that can't be repaired.

this totally defeats the purpose. You'll pay enormous fees, and the amounts are very limited.  WU and the like are for sending small amounts abroad for people  who can't have bank accounts (such as foreign workers). Using them to exchange bitcoin is ridiculous. 
If you want to use localbitcoins, exchange for cash.
The best and cheapest method is to open a bank account in the country you are gogin to study in, then use an exchange to change bitcoin to fiat and do a SEPA transfer to your new account.

this is a common misconception about quantum computers. They cannot solve in linear time any problem that a "normal" computer can solve in exponential time.  For some  specific problems they can give almost that level of speed-up, but a special algorithm has to be found for each problem, and for some problems there is almos no speed-up.

he used crypto libraries  already available at the time, specifically openssl.  Schnorr was not availalbe in standrad libraries and he'd probably just need too much time and effort to implement and test everything.

this infographic is not true for the present-day computing either. 
There is no mathematical proof that SHA256 is secure in any way.  The implicit assertion in the picture that reversing SHA256 takes about 2^256 computations does not have any mathematical foundation. The only reason we believe that SHA256 is secure is because nobody managed to break it so far - and many smart people tried.  
So that pic should not have the sun on it, but some people wearing glasses instead.

why would miners do it? or why would it be cheaper?  In the simple scheme I described the miners simply select the highest-paying tx for their blocks. The cost/profit ratio  for Molly tends to 0 with time (the cost is constant, the profit linear in time). Most importantly, no collusion or agreement is necessary. It's enough that everyone is selfish and greedy.

first you need to find out whether coinbase actually sent the bitcoins. Do you have the tx number? If not, demand coinbase send it to you. If they don't have it, it's coinbase that is to blame. If they do and the output matches the address expedia gave you, it's expedia that is to blame, and you have a proof of payment. 
To avoid this conundrum in the future, always withdraw to your own wallet first.

some interesting data, but there is one big problem with the analysis: there is no verification of the results. Yes, it draws nice clusters.

Edit:  the signature provided publicly is bogus. Some prominent personalities (Andresen and Matonis) claim to have seen the valid signature.
 Craig Wright provides a signature of a certain text (a speech by Paul Sartre) with the public key of the coinbase tx of block 9.  Why 9 - because Satoshi was known to send some BTC from this block's coinbase to Hal Finney (and this was the first bitcoin transaction from person to person). 
The signed text does not contain either Craig's name nor the current date. 
It remains plausible that someone else (e.g., the true Satoshi) has signed the presented text (by Sartre) sometime earlier, and Craig Write somehow came upon the signature which he now presents. 
Craig Wright  refuses to sign anything else with any other key.

No, they don't have to collectively agree to anything.  All they have to do is to act selfish and greedy: fill the block with the highest-fee-paying transactions.  Their "spam" transactions will not be included simply because there will be enough higher-paying transactions by users.

you can run the client with -datadir=[where to put the files]  option.
In addition to this "gotcha", bitcoin core and its ABC fork won't be able to run concurrently, because they use the same port to connect. (This probably can be cercumvented somehow as well... )
The article also mentions


I just checked, this alt currenlty trades at BTC 0.0006 per.   So even on this obscure alt a hodler can make an extra 0.06%.  I'm sure the much-advertised (not in the least, by all the hate)  ABC aka Cash alt will trade at a much higher rate.

The price I quoted is for the little-known "bitcore" alt - I only first heard about it in the article linked in the OP. I checked the (obscure) exchange linked directly in the bitcointalk forum, so I'm sure it's that alt.  The current price for the BCC alt futures token on ViaBTC is much higher, about 0.18 per currently, but that doesn't say much about the price of the actual alt once (and if) it comes to life

While the agreement is most welcome, the change to segwit adoption scheme seems redundant. If 80% of mining power start signalling, the rest will join just for fear of being forced to - the majority can start orphaning their blocks if they refuse to (effectively reaching 100% signalling on the longest chain).
Really quite pointless.

Nothing is certain for now, but they plan to release an electrum fork by aug 1. For now they have a fork of Core.  Once and if the fork happens, the obvious thing to do would be send your coins to different addresses under your control on different chains. When the transactions have succesfully confirmed on both chains, procede from there selling/exchanging whichever one you want. 
right now it's possible to sell the fork *token* on ViaBTC, but you have to keep  your BTC locked on the exchange until Aug 1st, and you have to trust ViaBTC to release your coins after that.  This seems a better deal than with BTU token on Bitfinex - there you had to lock your BTC on the exchange till 1st of Jan next year, but still too risky for my taste (this is just a personal opinion though).
