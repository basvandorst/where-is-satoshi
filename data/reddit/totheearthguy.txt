That is incorrect. View the trajectory of the moon around the sun here:


This friction is not a product of the moon/earth being like a binary planet system as you suggest. It is a feature that is common to moons and planets. On some planets the friction is so great that it actually heats the planet. It is a significant effect on Io, a moon of jupiter. (It's called [Tidal Heating](


The tide is mostly a product of just the moon/earth gravity, though the sun's gravity contributes, creating different tidal seasons:

Actually I think that is the only point of yours that I didn't address :)
The moon is moving away from the earth because of tidal friction, not because the moon isn't a satellite:
A satellite can fall toward the orbited object or away from it.

It revolves around the earth.

But I showed you that trajectory, and that isn't the case:

Not sure what you mean by this. Any time one body orbits another, they both orbit their center of mass.
E.g.: The earth doesn't orbit the sun. It orbits the center of mass of the sun/earth system, which is slightly away from the sun's center.
