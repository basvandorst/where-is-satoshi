Well most likely is big farms upgrading to 16nm miners.  We as miners were expecting this for some time. But more so right after halving not almost a month later. But speculation was that some just got the power bills and decided it was time to call it quits.  Many factors could have been at play.  There have been some mean storms in China aswell. Could have had power outage and/internet outage. Then you have bitmain possibly trying to take advantage of the market situation.  Raise the diff high now to push out the s7 miners on hashnest.  They have a short window now do it while price is lower and diff is going to go higher.  Just some food for thought.

Buy a gpu.  Amd 390x the xfx 8dfr is a great card.  Can be volt modded.  Or the new line from amd rx4xx series   Best efficiency and nice price.  With gpu you can resell later or use for gaming.  ASIC becomes a noisey paper weight.  And the three month fuck you warranty doesn't say much for the confidence that the s9 will last till roi. Gpu has 2-3 year warranties:)

Not a gimmick. It's the only way to scale crypto.  When eth hits 100k tps and Bitcoin still sits at three then we will see a mass exodus from bitcoin.   Ethereum if it can facilitate moving around of money on a scale we need it can be successful at under 1$. Best Regards

It’s going to last way longer than you think.  They are selling miners hand over fist.  They can’t make them fast enough. Until that stops then they will continue to do what bitmain does. It’s obv. That bcash is no solution when bitcoin fees are trivial.  Makes for a hard sell of bcash about now.  Let’s hope the rumors of Samsung building ASICs is true.  We need some real competition and honestly I’d like to see bitmain fall to the side.  They have been bad actors from day one. Greed got the best of ole Wu

You are correct there. We are growing at about 2% a day. Or 20k s9’s equivalent.  We just peaked at 21exahash. Up about 7 exahash since Xmas!!!  Or about 7 mil terahashes=over 1/2 million s9’s. No end in site. Checkout. Http://Bitcoin.sipa.be BR

If you think the rest of the poor people of this world is going to buy bitcoin is beyond silly. Keep pumping and dumping on those that have the money to play the markets and soon you will have no one left to play.  Keep it up your school of hard knocks working damn well.

I'd say at most 10% is hash by us small miners maybe less. Prolly more realistic is 5%.  China is dominating in this area.  Last check they have 70% of the network.  I remember not too long ago ghash getting blasted and ddos'ed till they got with the program. I have a feeling they don't give two shits about the network security they will mine it right down to zero if you let em.  I for one will no longer support any of the ASIC manufacturers  once my machines cost more than it makes I'm out.  It's bad enough they figured out how to price the machines high while waiting to turn all the hash on so that they can really stick it to the ones that supported this from the beginning. I just don't like where it's going at all.  More will come to this realization soon!  Here's a link I use to watch them play with our money.

Yes in fact it is.. And with them getting closer and closer to monopolizing on the hash where does that leave us on a supposed decentralized currency.. How will protocols in future be handled when one country has the majority of hash.. Can we then "trust" this system if its in more less one entities control.  Check this page you can see that china has over 65% of btc hashpower.  You can also see the spike we had just recently

id say most likey much much sooner.. next diff increase is going to squeeze out any remaining profits whatsoever.. the people mining will soon be paying them..when the rewards go negative id imagine they will start dissolving your ghs for repayment..  better watch out for what to come from them ... mining is hardly profitable the way it is and to give them a maintenance fee that is equivalent to 30 or 40 cents a kw in power id strongly reconsider..

well as for the initial pool address it was created over a year ago. and could have fallen to ill hands.. Now as for our new pool address.. we created it on off line computer with passphrase then transferred the wallet.dat to the pool.  also we shut down autopayouts from pool as that left our wallet unsecure.. now all payouts are to be done manually with the passphrase  also have integrated authy into the backend.  live and learn some hard lessons.. would love to have this guy learn one as well.. I work damn hard to get where I got!.. to have it taken this way really upsets me!

shouldn't you have to register your ip with blockchain before your allowed to submit work...?  that would alleviate all the fud about pools hiding blocks.
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:47:05
Somebody has to do it! Right?  so if more than one person starts to work on it its automatically colluding?  Some people are out for the better of the community  and Luke-jr is surely one of those people!!  Not all are malicious and im not saying ghash didn't learn there lesson everyone makes mistakes.  but they went and let the pool get scary close to 50% and the market did crash.. so even though it wasn't malicious the fear drives markets... something has to be done now before bigger players get involved..
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:23:57
more worried that if other countries follow suit then when taxes hit mining will be non profitable   that's the biggest problem...  all the hits in the wrong way for bitcoin lately.. govt auction. ghash at 51%, diff rising 32% and the manufacturers are "testing" for longer than ever   double dipping!!!.. it just keeps piling up lately  the small guy miner is a myth anymore.. something has to change very fast..or satoshi dream will die

now the answer from ghash/cex: 
CEX.IO official statement:
In October the development of the “GHash.IO” project was transferred to the CEX.IO development team. 
The team worked hard to completely rewrite the whole GHash.IO engine, as well as perform other stability and responsiveness improvements, which you all may have noticed. We have also removed the 3% fee and released merged-mining alt coins to the miners.
We would like to state that CEX.IO does not have any affiliation with the double-spending attack. As a part of the bitcoin community we condemn such actions, which harm the bitcoin network.
We have conducted an internal investigation and can confirm, that from the 25th to 27th of September, the GHash.IO pool was mining on the address: 1MA7CKbWMyKdPkmsbnwmfeLh1hYy5A3gy8 to which we do not have any access or connection.
However, the rewards for mined blocks on the above mentioned address were paid out from the GHash.IO wallet as per usual.
Following further investigation and server log analysis we have noticed that several private keys were imported to the GHash.IO wallet within that time period. (exact date could not be determined). This was done to conceal the missing bitcoins, since there was no direct deposit transaction.
We haven’t found any signs of the system being compromised, but we believe that the attack was made from within the former development team.
At the moment CEX.IO LTD is the lawful owner of the CEX.IO and GHash.IO projects as well as their domains. 
Our team at CEX.IO LTD. will do everything possible to prevent pool capacity manipulation in the future.
We understand the communities’ concern about the misconduct of such great computing power at our pool (since recently we have become the  pool), and we will gladly take into consideration any comments or suggestions to improve the pool’s security and overall quality of service.

yea that might be acid.. I cant seem to mine on bw.. or was too stupid to figure it out.. lol
@_date: 2015-05-24 19:55:11
well just have to agree to disagree.. and not just recently.. ive been onto this for months now.. This a ripple effect that goes across the network.. if you can stay ahead you win.. if you are always picking wrong pool then you lose.. so far ive won.. ONLY way to stop this from happening is to have all pools be the same size in petahash.. that will never happen.. so one can be one step ahead and always hit the pool lucky streak instead of staying put and let it go in the tank like i said antpool would do and will continue to do for some time yet.. I understand the statistics of it.. But you have to look at a probality stand point.. if i submit x amount of shares my probability of find a block decreases. the more i go over that the better my odds are of finding a block as ive went thru say double the expected amount.. In looking at all the pools that go to say 300 % cdf or even higher are ALWAYS!!! followed by a bout of super low cdf blocks (lucky) blocks.. You can chose to ignore this but i will not.. At this point today with the last slush block i could let the rest of my 10 hours run on f2 pool and just make about 30 % over for the day but im gonna push my luck and stay on slush and see if i can pop a couple more.. Then again ill see if antpool looks like its Due for more lucky blokcs.. I know this isnt how it should be working but its working great for me.. To come on and say it cant is very closed minded.. 
Best Regards
@_date: 2015-05-24 14:02:27
yes it does WORK.. why are everyone here so damn closed minded.. so let me explain,,, slush is 17 peta  exactly 1/4 size of antpool at 68 peta.. so if i get my 6 blocks in less than 12 hours on slush then just swap to antpool to complete the day.. there has been some weird bouts of extended periods of slush not finding blocks for over 12hours hell the last one was 20 hours right when i swapped.. ive since in 8 hours time found 4 blocks.. which is equivalent of 16 antpool blocks.. Antpool has to find one at least every hour to staY at 100 cdf whereas slush only needs to find one in 4 hours.. yea id say im lucky but it CAN work..

i agree  if you look at all the pools last week  Antpool was kicking ass.. I have been bouncing antpool right after they hit bad streak and kicking over to slush and vice versa.. i just got 200 % off slush yesterday  .. so far been avg 150 % ... just got to be some luck on my side tho as i have been guessing great as to when to swap my stratum.. id say for now tho watch out for antpool if variance hits them like it should they will have some really bad days coming.. as they have been killing it..

Your spot on Luke.  These same delusional people are the same sheep that herd into the election booth thinking they actually have some say in who is elected.  Big money has ahold of btc now. It goes in what direction they decide.  Might as well save all the hassles of decentralization and just run one mega pool.  Cutting variance to 0. Or near 0.  Then make the pool code so that x amount of devs have access with keys to change pool code.  That way it can't be altered.  Make it open source.  Then set diff ports on the pool for all the diff flavor a of btc.  Classic core unlimited.  Then each miner can point to a port.  2% fee or whatever is needed to cover costs of upkeep and server.  What is extra at end of year use towards development or whatever.  Centralization is inevitable.  I don't know why we strive to be as inefficient as possible.  The notion of decentralization and bigger blocks doesn't really work out that well.  Anyway just a thought.  I'm sure most will think it's outlandish. Ahh well worth a thought anyway

what i have been doing is taking a big risk yes.. but what has been happening is slush has been finding all its blocks for the day in about 6 - 12 hour span.. so after i get what im supposed to for the 24 hours(say its .5btc) i then for  the rest of 12 hours swap to antpool.. just got to look at all the pools.. chances are great if tehy go a long stretch of no blocks they will hit a really good luck streak.. Look at ban for example tehy know this all to well. they will hit several over 300 % then like 7 in row under 50 % cdf.. i realize its luck but it sure seems to run like clockwork.. look at slush blocks stats you will see same pattern.. if they have several days under 6 blocks which is what they should get for the day tehy will hit several sometimes double in 24 hours what they should hit statistically.. it holds true for just about every pool.. the end result is 100 % cdf.. but when a pool falls way below they seem to always get a really lucky streak to bring that number back to 100 %.. Start watching the pool blocks stats you will see what i mean..

Looking at those numbers leads me again to the question how this is ever going to be decentralized. 1% look like they run this too��. Goto page 5 of my link. You can see how they try to hide it by splitting the btc up into many 3k btc addys lol.  Or I guess if one wallet is compromised they don't lose it all but I'm sure it's same individual that made all those wallets.  Btc turning into a "rich mans trick"

Because they are no longer small miners pointing to the pools.  It's mega farms in the hundreds of ph.  Look at the bitcointalk forum.  Those of us small guys are down to a handful now.  This coin is no longer dencentralized.  It's broken by satoshi standards.  Or he wasn't smart enough to understand you can't have decentralization if we don't all have access to the same resources.  Ie power machine costs labor etc.  this is an end game with China being the only one left to mine in the foreseeable future. Within a few years if current trends hold.  They already control over 80% of the network   So if you feel you can trust China will never do anything malicious then I guess why do we keep discussing it.  Decentralization is off the table even for pos as too many rich hands in the game now.  It's over unless we accept the fact that it cannot be decentralized without equal resources. That won't happen before it's too late aswell.  So let's just get over it and move on.

Just like mining for that next block. Past performance should not be used to gauge future expectations. I'd say it's only going to give those that have been keeping the price propped up a break. Mostly China mining   Seems like a complex ponzi where they make the machines for next to nothing. Sell them at triple costs or more. Use some of that to make their farms larger and keep the price afloat. All while slowly pushing everyone out.  There's about 1 honest service to every 10 scams. I don't see price doing much more than it already has.  But if it does it just the manipulators looking to pump and dump it on all those thinking it will moon.  Bitcoin ultimately will be worth 0$ is the goal.  Everything priced in btc.  Main objective would be to just acquire more btc.  It's an all out gamble anyway you look at it:)

Theyre gonna make sure they get back their money from US tariffs since they aren’t selling us miners now.  Bitmain is all about money could care less if this makes it or not.  Just here selling shovels����. Bitmain hoping if they can cause another backlog maybe people will be forced to use bcash.  Lol so much for decentralization.    Like I’ve said and I’ll say it again. Decentralization is a pipe dream.  Too many people that “know” best to allow this to happen.  Too many in this field invested more than they can afford to lose(cough cough bitmain im looking at you). Now it’s time to get back by any means necessary.  That should scare the hell out of you.  Should make you question how many coins does bitmain develop.  Surely we don’t think it’s just one right. They wouldn’t make machines for other algos if they didn’t first think they could game it.  Bitmain is the cancer of crypto and we all know what happens when cancer goes unchecked.  Sadly just one of the more prominent firsts of crypto.  Since it’s secured by greed this power struggle will always be a thing. Sounds like a load of fun to me. Always trying to convince people why your coin is best. Lol. Seems draining at the least. I guess tho I rather this play out over the internet than where this struggle play out today. Far too much bloodshed

Your not taking into account that the difficulty went up 3x since it was 230. So take that into account and also the halving I'd say some will leave yes.  But all the huge farms which is what btc is ran off of now will be just fine.  I expect a small hiccup and difficulty resuming the upward trend.  We just had the bitmain s9 released which is just shy of 3x increase in efficiency. Coupled with a recent spike of almost 600peta hash on the network I'd say it's going to be a ruff year for the small miners. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:16:54
Or if your one of those in the know maybe this was all planned from the get go.  It was well stated that dao could and most likely will have some issues.  Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  Pump and dumpers are a cancer to crypto.  Be nice if they take a good hit once and a while.  Anyway eth was rising too fast. It was due to correct. Just prolly not this much.  Get it cheap while you still can. Once the whales realize it's just the dao and not eth itself then they will buy back lol.  It's a matter now of who gets bought back in first of the p&amp;d ers. Who will make the most.  With the sell orders I see on that chart it was some big people in the know that dumped.  Imagine that. ;). Could this have been the plan all along. Shake out the week hands it did indeed lmao!!
@_date: 2016-06-09 13:50:21
 the reason this doesnt happen is all the large farms are in tight with the mining manufacturers. Also the manu. self mine with the cheap hw they sell to us at double costs if not more.    And let us not forget in 1 month that 13 ths goes to 6.5 due to halving.. Plus we just seen a huge jump in speed on the network from the mega farms..  Reason we dont see one of these in every house is the gouging of the price and the barrier for entry is now too high.  Plus you have to have less then .05 cents per kw power costs thats tax and all or you will never roi.. And nobody buys these to not get their money back.&gt; This would have worked like satoshi intended had the asic not been built.  He even cringed when they asked him about gpu mining it.&gt; Satoshi asked them nicely to hold off mining it with gpu even.  Now it looks like we will have to forgo decentralization till the rewards get back to where its not profitable to mine with 7 nm asic.  Then we will see it fall back to pc's  or hell by then maybe windows or linux loads btc node as default on installation.  Hard to say but asics have put a real damper on the decentralized aspect of btc.. I say they all have the best interest in not killing the golden goose.. But those in fiat land may not think the same.&gt; Thats why its A MUST to be decentralized.  Best Regards

They can play the hack scenario maybe one or two days payouts gone.  But just remember. The hackers cannot steal your miners online.  If they really have hw then a scenario like this is usually when it's make or break for cloud ops.  Hope you all didn't invest too much.  Best regards

No matter what there is always more debt than currency to even pay it back. Which leads them to have to create more.  Boy what a mess they have created for us.

I see you have designated ports for the bip101.. I wasnt aware of that. The article is a bit misinformed..&gt; Only the miners that are on that port and find a block will be in support of 101..  Article in question..

Mostly if not all this latest increase pushing us over 1exahash is China.  They currently control 70% of the network and growing.  No signs of stopping either.

Samsung is going to be joining this space. They aren’t going to stand idolly by and watch bitmain rake in billions in profit year after year and not jump in themselves. I’m guessing Samsung decided why let bitmain make all the money. Samsung can just sell us the miners with their ram and prolly 10x their profit.

Cloud mining UFF... same goes with private keys you dont own them you dont own the BTC.. Same is true with the miners unfortunately..  Cloud mining will never work.. and sad thing is if they have any decent amount of kw use they will get industrial rates at about .02 .04 per kw  so for them to say they aren't profitable is BS!!!

its a solution anyway.. most people dont know how to setup a node and either setup own pool or try to swap out software on there mining rigs and go with luke solution..  Easy is what people want.. Solo ck is easy as it gets.. And as far as variance.. either your machine hits a block or it dont...but most that are doing this are doing it with a couple ths at most.  so variance isnt an issue as it would take a couple years technically to hit one anyway.. and thats 100 cdf..  best Regards d57heinz

Thanks for correcting me  you are right this isnt solo mining.. Its pooled mining with the block finder getting full reward minus .5%.  But for the size of there pool in comparison to the network it might as well be solo.  most times its only 350 ths..  Thanks for providing a better solution to solo mining. Best regards d57heinz

@_date: 2015-09-22 13:55:50
yes Bitmain understands this all too well..  Thus the need for the antrouter they briefly previewed on their site.  Its looking like the transactions wont be enough to subsidize the asic miners enough to make up 12.5 btc after halving.  Unless the price rises double(which i doubt More like halving) we will see more large farms collapse.  Gonna be a interesting ride the next few years thats for certain!!  Best Regards

I think you just hit on one of the major hurdles that plague crypto. So many coins   Most to only be scams for pump and dump. Open source. Only in moderation. At some point it becomes noise and a hinderence instead of options!
@_date: 2015-09-24 13:23:50
  You can solo mine on this pool without having to figure out the setup.  Just point to ck pool and have a go at it.. I really like this idea i proposed something on the like of solo sundays.. where every one that is  on a pool go solo and if it hits then stay on solo as most likely the block you hit will cover the costs of your machine..  And if you dont hit one that sunday swap back to pool and try your luck next week:)

Ufff so many ways btc can scam people. As of late that's all it seems to attract.  When the thought of riches stops blinding you all and you come back down to earth. I hope your not all fleeced to the point your out on the street.  At what point does the rest of the world start to look at all of us as scammers if we don't start to distance ourselves from btc.  Like I said on the btc talk forum.  This should never have been given a monetary value before it was even minutely close to being ready.  Now it's just a fucking mess all around. Everything that touches it gets burnt!  Best regards

great read.  anyone else catch that Andreas refers to Satoshi as female.:)  "The “visionary” in this case was Satoshi Nakamoto. I was only explaining the reasoning behind her decision to keep the scripting language limited. Ethereum makes different tradeoffs between security/immutability and flexbility. We will see what applications will emerge that are better for Ethereum rather than bitcoin. I’m sure there will be many applications that need Ethereum level of flexibility. I am sure there will be many applications that need Bitcoin level of security. Both chains will be successful, in different domains.

Great points.  It's being discussed in more depth here.  Seems there is more to it or at least appears so.  On my mobile so that may appear wonky. search on Reddit should bring it up.  BR

Thank you.  Couldn't have said it better myself.  Bitcoin has a laundry list of issues but let's focus on eth so we can hope btc problems can be fixed while pressure is on eth.  I'm sure most of these attackers are pumpers of other coins.  Sadly tho btc won't do anything spectacular this halving that it hasn't done already in the last months.  Too many people wising up to the games being played in crypto.  Seems to me let's bring a bunch of people who don't know shit about this industry into it and then dump it on their heads.  I keep seeing this time and time again.  It's getting old aswell.  If Bitcoin is so great then people will use it.  All this hype and bs against other coins is just too much and overly obvious:)
