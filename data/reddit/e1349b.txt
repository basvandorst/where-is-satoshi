The company uses BitPay, which for this purchase, gave it 15 minutes to verify the transaction. I think both times my transaction took over 20 minutes.

Fair enough. I see and agree with your point.

The USD is up, by the way. So I wouldn't say it's depreciating.... If BTC is a better store of value, then really it's not a currency at all, is it? If that's the case, we need to stop pretending that it is, and that is this awesome decentralized currency.

Buying locally, that is true, but they could still use BTC to buy online, correct? I just see Bitcoin as a way to buy and sell good without government intervention :) But don't get me wrong, I see your point.

It's awesome that you're trying to sell a product for BTC! I have some advice though. 
Before you start trying to sell it the shirt online, make some prototypes and share them with friends, even if they don't know what BitCoin is. Ask them if it's something they would wear. 
I think you can improve on your work :)
Keep it up man.

I think the BTC going to that SC2 tournament was awesome first of all. 
So, with the extra BTC, maybe we could have monthly raffles, or contests, or something that would contribute to the Bitcoin community?

I didn't think about the legal aspect. It is something I will consider for sure. 
Also, ROI after two years isn't horrible... Did you calc depreciation? 
@_date: 2014-01-11 23:53:36
I agree that there are no guarantees. It's like any investment in that it could go sour or it could profit. Personally, I think that when I need to use the Bitcoins late this year (around Nov/Dec or maybe later), they will be worth  more than $900 USD currently. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:16:50

Yeah. I have this problem trying to talk about BitCoins to people at my University. They go right to the "well you will lose money" or that it is some kind of money making gimmick. They will never actually talk about the currency its self and how it works. Pretty frustrating.

Bring someone with you. Download MyCelium on your phone and generate a few keys. You can then take the transactions  on multiple keys. Have your phone synced with dropbox. The second you create the keys with MyCelium, backup your wallet, write the password down or save it on your phone, and then verify the backup works. After you have verified that you backup works, then have the BTC sent over. 
This way you KNOW your wallet is backed up, on cloud storage + your phone (the backup encrypted private key) and you KNOW that your backup works. Also, if for some freak reason one of your keys is deleted, and you backup somehow is deleted, you are not out all of your money.

It is not uncommon for people to go from undergrad to get their doctorate. Also, who gives a fuck if he is not educated (I mean doesn't have a degree). He probably has more money than you do now so bugger off.

After my friend and I researched it, we found out that 50btc.com got hacked, and that I didn't really have that many BitCoins.... Needless to say it was a sinking feeling, haha.

I live in Kansas City! Finally a place that is practical is accepting BTC here!
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:48:00
From what I have seen, a lot of those issue is that either they don't read (CoinBase says when you buy the BTC that without level 2 verification, it will take a few days for coins. It took me 7 days for mine).  Also, it could be an issue with their bank. I saw that post about getting BTC at a different value, but I am skeptical about that also. I think a lot of it is user error. But as I said, my experience with them was fine. I had no issues, so I just have that to go off of. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 20:15:05
I mentioned something like this in a business class at my Uni. Some guy looked and me when I said that nothing really backs the dollar, and he said "what are you talking about... Gold does"

This is such a big deal. I don't think people realize how easy it is for businesses to charge extra fees and charges without your full consent.

@_date: 2013-11-30 18:54:06
Yes! Talking and speculation about the price isn't going to help BTC. Actually using and supporting businesses that take BTC will.

@_date: 2013-12-05 16:23:28
I agree. Sending BTC to another exchange (I use BTC-e) and then buying your other currency would be best. Watch out for the other currencies though, since they are prone to pump and dumps almost everyday. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:25:06
This post is a little harsh I think. In mu opinion it really depends on the family members/friends that are receiving the BTC
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:36:30
Ah okay, then I saw go for it. I was actually thinking of doing the same. I understand that there is a risk to buying, say, $100 worth of PrimeCoin, but there is always that what-if. As long as I am okay with losing that $100, and I realize that I am taking a risk with that $100. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 21:17:16
I am more interested in the discussion. :p
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:15:44
What? No, I am all for the free market, making a profit, all that jazz. It's just nice to see posts about Bitcoin that is not all about the price, and how much the OP has lost or gain, but about the uses of Bitcoin and topics as such. No need to attack me. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:53:41
Hence why this weekly thread is a good idea
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:41:08
I backup using the Android app MyCelium. Generate a new key in it, transfer your bitcoins to it, and then run the backup tool. This will create a PDF file which you save, and it will give you a password. Write this password down! It's important. After you have saved your password and saved the PDF, the app will have you verify that the backup works, aka you wrote you password down right. 
Basically the backup encrypts where you private key is, and the only way to unencrypted it is to use the password as the key. So you could get a new phone, download the MyCelium app, scan the PDF that you backed up, the app will ask you for your password, which it will then use to import the information about your bitcoin. 
Hope I explained this good enough. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:59:33
I never said the price would stay at $250. I was saying that for mass adaptation to occur, the price per Bitcoin would need to be lower. 
I'm also aware that Bitcoins are limited. The current price hike was not due to the limited number of Bitcoin, but rather the speculation of the price growing and the strength of China. Obviously when more adaptation occurs the price will increase, but I don't think that would have happened at the price of $1000+ USD per Bitcoin.
