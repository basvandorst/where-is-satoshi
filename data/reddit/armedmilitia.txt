Let's say your fridge shipped with two 21 chips in it: that means it's pulling around 60W 24/7, which at $0.25/kwh works out to $10.80 a month in power costs.

Why not ship the miners with 0.5 BTC pre-loaded on them?

Sure, they will continue to stream, but the total amount will eventually approach some number as difficulty increases and revenue decreases. That number is about 0.3BTC.
There's no difference between that and a fixed amount, other than the fact it takes longer to get.
@_date: 2015-12-02 21:27:38
huh? The machine can generate, at most, ~0.3 BTC over its lifetime. If it needs more than that the chip won't save you--that's the upper limit. Shipping it with 0.5BTC instead of a chip would make the device more capable, cheaper, more environmentally friendly, smaller,  require less power, and require less heat dissipation. It actually **increases** utility to do it that way: plus if it never uses 0.5BTC over its lifetime you can always transfer the funds off. 
There's absolutely no reason for the chip.
@_date: 2015-12-03 00:15:20
I fail to see the advantage of having a chip which mines 0.3BTC over its lifetime versus preloading the device with 0.5BTC. Saves time, power, and size.

There's a minimum fee of 0.0001BTC for transactions that do not qualify as free. 
One hundred million one-satoshi transactions work out to 50GB at an average size of 500 bytes each. Fee for that works out to two papa john's pizzas--10000BTC at minimum. Of course, since you are paying the smallest fees miners will prioritise your transactions last. Even some free transactions will still have priority over your 'spam'. 
As a miner, I would appreciate the extra income from these fees. So please do go out and send those transactions!

1. You can't realistically expect to force people to waste power mining BTC for you. All they have to do is remove the ASIC controller, or disconnect from the internet, or block whatever mining pool the chip connects to in their hosts file, or crack the firmware, or change the mining payout address, etc. Plus it's a big waste of power and requires extra heat dissipation, so the incentive to tune their machine is already there. If you want to contractually bind someone to have a monthly payment scheme for hardware, you can already do that. Just ask for x BTC a month, and if they don't pay up, sue them. It's pretty much what they'll end up doing with this scheme, in a roundabout way.
2. Power costs in the developing world are prohibitive (except for certain resource rich countries like VZ and kuwait). People will have a big economic incentive to disable the chips--significant hashpower has a very significant power draw (and heat output!). It's pretty easy too: just block the MAC address of your 21 inc toaster in your router.

It's true that bitcoin clients cannot choose the miner that will mine the next block. However, if 10% of miners accept "low" fee transactions and 90% of miners only accept high fee transactions, then users can estimate, on average, how long it will take for their transaction to be included in a block. 
If bob wants to send a tx to alice, and time is not an issue, he can send it with a low fee.
Miners that accept low fee transactions will make more money on average, because they will receive transaction fees from both people who paid high and low fees. Miners that exclude low fee transactions completely miss out on those low fees. 
It's a no-brainer for joe miner to accept every transaction that has a fee.

A small balance (0.5BTC) of preloaded bitcoins also "just works", and is more convenient because it requires 1W to run the Pi instead of 30W to run the chip.

Yeah, I understand the difference between a pool and miners. The people in that picture actually own most of the hashpower on the network.
**Only two** of those people run mining pools (BW and F2POOL). [BW also operates a massive mine along with bitmain,]( so only two reps (F2Pool and FH) aren't major players in mining, unless they're hiding something. Also in that picture are the CEOs of Bitmain, Avalon, KnC, and Bitfury. In fact, the only HW manufacturer missing in that picture is SPT.
Those people can pull of a 75% attack with a bit of effort.
Believe it or not, hashpower IS NOT distributed.






**Users aren't miners.**
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:19:16
It's not a never ending supply of coins, the miner mines at a fixed rate with an increasing difficulty until the device breaks. Plug it in a calculator and you'll see: 0.3 bitcoin in 30 months if the difficulty doesn't change and the halving doesn't happen. Realistically it will be much less. 
0.5 BTC preloaded on the device is superior. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:39:22
Why? Can't you impersonate it with a machine that has a few of their own satoshis?
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:33:00


If you're talking about how someone who has physical access to the machine, they can just steal the device itself and flip it on ebay. If you're talking about someone hacking their device remotely and taking the BTC, that means that 21 makes shitty software, and you shouldn't be buying their devices regardless of the mining chip. 


You don't need to make an upfront investment in the loaded BTC. If someone buys one device for $400, stick $100 of BTC on it, then ship. Boom, $250 profit. 
You know what you do need to make a massive upfront investment in? Designing, manufacturing, and testing a bitcoin mining ASIC. 


If 21 thought bitcoin would appreciate 1000000%, they would invest all their own funds into BTC--not these devices.

Users have to consent (IE update their own clients) to use the new chain if it violates existing protocol rules. It does not matter if most miners are on the new chain--If most users don't upgrade, then the fork won't be successful.
This is because all nodes make sure blocks are valid before including them into the local copy of their chain. A few things determine the validity of a block: the blocksize must be &lt;= 1MB, the target difficulty must be met, all transactions must be valid, the hash of the previous block must be included, etc. 
If 90% of miners update their nodes to change one of those rules, newly mined blocks will still be rejected by all other clients. There's no "longest chain wins" scenario here, the chain is simply **invalid.** The other chain (in this case, non-xt chain) will win by default because there is no other valid chain. Users must update their clients (get XT) to see that chain as valid.
Edit: Condensed answer.
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:18:27
75% of hashpower isn't a consensus, all it takes is [seven of these guys]( to get your "supermajority".
Most exchanges and users could disagree but the fork would still happen in that case--and would be disastrous!
EDIT: I'm not talking mining pools here (seems to be some confusion). The people in that picture I'm talking about are the CEOs of Avalon, Bitmain, Bitfury, BW, and KNC. All of these organizations run massive mines that each hold a large share (ranging from 5-20% each) of the network.

Actually, no. It's completely random: a block is found **on average** every 10 minutes. Half of them are found earlier, half of them are found later. The odds stay the same.
It's similar to flipping a coin each minute until you get heads. Once the network wins the coin toss, it goes onto the next block. It could happen the first minute or the 50th minute, but the odds are the same each flip.

@_date: 2014-07-20 01:44:56
Let's just say, for example, that just before the next halving one miner will make 1 btc/day with his rig. And lets just say that by that time, your average miner will pay 0.75btc in electricity expenses for said rig. (That's not a true ratio right now, but for the sake of OP's point, it may be like this by 2016). 
The rational miner will keep mining right up until the halving, as he makes 0.25 btc profit per day. Once the halving hits, however, the story changes. He now only makes 0.5btc per day, and still pays 0.75btc in electricity. His rational decision is to turn the rig off.
Now, imagine all miners are competing for bitcoins. It is probable that most, if not the vast majority, will be rendered unprofitable by the halving. They'll all turn their rigs off. Let's say that 90% of bitcoin miners are in the red. That means that they won't be mining.
Now blocks are going to take 10x as long to confirm. And even worse, instead of taking 2 weeks to lower the difficulty, it'll take 20 weeks.
@_date: 2014-05-15 04:03:57


Look, although I agree with you mostly, this statement in particular rustled my jimmies. A higher hashrate isn't necessarily a good thing.
 Bitcoin was more secure in 2012 than it is today. There were more mining pools, less datacenters, and the hashrate (although small) was *distributed*. Today, bitcoin is anything but. Ghash.io, a single pool, controls ~40% of the hashrate. Add one colluding pool and you've got the magic 51%. That's right, all it takes is two people to derail the bitcoin train. And don't get me started on KnCminers huge farm. 
I'm not saying dogecoin is immune to any of this, they have it even worse than bitcoin. But to say they're doomed for having a low hashrate, while we're dooming ourselves by putting our huge hashrate in less hands, is a tad bit hypocritical. 
Bitcoin has been losing nodes like crazy recently, as it turns out that people don't want to download a 20gb blockchain, and opt for light wallets instead. Less nodes means less security, as they **are** the underlying network. Bitcoin has 7414 nodes. Dogecoin has 4708. Bitcoin's market cap is 150x higher, while it doesn't even have double the nodes.

Heads up, DGC is the short form for DigitalCoin. Dogecoin is DOGE. 
Total hashrate is a little misleading, no? It's more about the distribution. Dogecoin is in a pretty bad position because of the rapid decline in block reward (this forces the hashrate down), but an argument could also be made against bitcoin's very centralized hashrate. Bitcoin has a huge hashrate, but large chunks of it are in the control of single people. Now, dogecoin seems to be in a downward spiral, and if things keep going and the devs just walk away then that's what will happen, the hashrate will plummet to nearly zero. However, there's been talk of merge mining DOGE and litecoin, and there's been talk of having DOGE be the parent coin to Tacocoin and a few other weird ones. If merge mining takes off, then dogecoin should be fine. 
IMO it might be a good idea for doge to hard fork and merge mine off of bitcoin, vertcoin, or litecoin as a child coin. 
Remember though, everyone's in the same boat on this. If dogecoin fails, people are going to be pointing fingers and saying that no coin, not even bitcoin, is safe.

Hopefully! I'm less of an optimist, and I'm thinking most datacenters that don't have much cash-in-hand won't be able to keep their lights on. I think the biggest problem we have is that the difficulty will take a very long time to adjust--if 50% of miners drop off it will take a month, if 75% of miners drop off it will take two months, if 90% drop off it will take almost 6 months, and if 95% drop off it will take a bit under a year. 
A good solution IMO would be to implement a KGW-style difficulty adjustment (where it adjusts slightly every block) or a tapering block reward. I'm wondering if core devs have talked about this (I haven't seen this problem widely discussed).

Not OP, but I'm super into bitcoin mining, so I might be able to offer some insight
By the looks of it, he's got KNC Jupiters. Those are some of the few miners that shipped on time and provided a positive ROI. OP is probably well in the green from his mining, unless he bought those miners used. 
EDIT: Also noticed some antminer S1's in the background. Those shipped at a decent price and delivered on time, but I'm not sure if they would have ROI'd in his case. If his electricity costs are too high now, that leads me to believe he's paying ~$0.13-$0.15 kw/h. (Undervolted to 140GH, they'd be just about breaking even now @ 160w) With those costs he probably did not profit on the S1s. Total profit on his jupiters probably outweighed though, leaving him at a net positive. (?)

Interestingly enough, this process is how some wikipedia articles stay incorrect: A person edits in an unsubstantiated fact, then a online newspaper/blog references it, and then another editor cites that newspaper/blog as the source in the wikipedia article--as more people start referencing the article, more "sources" appear, and the legitimacy of the fact becomes more entrenched as time goes on. It's called a circular reference.

Copypasta, because it's late.












You wouldn't start mining, because the difficulty is now too high to support mining at a now 12.5btc block reward. You would need to wait for the difficulty to adjust downwards at the next adjustment. That won't take two weeks like normal. Why? Since a huge portion of the network went offline, block times will shoot up to 100mins or more. Since adjustments occur every 2048 blocks, this might take excessively long. We're talking months long. 
Halving the block reward between one block and the next is a bad idea.  The market can't react to that.

You didn't read OP's post. 
By the time of the next halving, mining  revenue should be nearly at equilibrium with power cost (It's already approaching it). When the halving occurs, it will instantly switch from being slightly profitable to run your rig to being unprofitable (due to electricity cost). Most miners will do the only rational thing: Turn off their rig. Sure, some might be profitable, but most won't. Then the network slows and stalls, working at a snails pace for MONTHS.

Short blurb about difficulty:
Well, the bitcoin protocol is designed to have a new difficulty adjustment every 2048 blocks, which at 10 minutes per block (the target) works out to every two weeks. Lets say the day the difficulty hits 20 billion, the speed of the network doubles. Then each block will take 5 minutes, until the next difficulty adjustment. Since the blocktime is half as long, it takes half the time for the difficulty adjustment (1 week). Then the protocol looks at the average time between blocks and adjusts the difficulty to meet the target. In this example, the difficulty will double, and the block time will be back to 10 mins. It's the nature of the protocol. However, for a short time, the network will be confirming blocks twice as fast.
Right after the halving, a lot of people (we're talking vast majority) should drop off the network (for reasons explained above). That means the time for a block to be solved at the current difficulty will be very high. We're talking 100mins or worse. Here comes our problem: it still takes 2048 blocks to determine a new difficulty, but now because blocks are coming so slow it will take a huge amount of time to adjust. If 20% of the network is left, it will take 10 weeks. 10% of the network left will take 20 weeks. Once you dip below 3% it'll be over a year.

That would require a "hard fork" (every node needs to update their client). Although it is possible to do that, it would be... inconvenient for most users, and very inconvenient for pool operators, exchanges, and some merchants.  And the bonus is that if some miners refuse to update, then you get a fork in the blockchain, with the old version competing with the new one for hashpower, which would probably shake confidence in bitcoin.

A different solution exists with the greenaddress wallet. It's a 2 of 2 multisig wallet, which means both you and greenaddress have to authorize transactions. Greenaddress won't sign if you attempt a double spend, which means that merchants can accept 0 confirmation transactions from greenaddress wallets. Best of all, greenaddress can't run with your money, because your signature is also required to send your coins. If greenaddress goes down, you still get your coins back (after a set time passes) using nlocktime.

Not many people still mine with inefficient hardware--compared to bitfury's 30MW datacenters, the "average joe" miners are piss in the ocean when you look at total power consumption.
Just gonna pop an edit here to elaborate:
 Most "hobby" miners do so with less than a KW of hardware. Once you go above that, heat + noise + electricity costs start to factor in significantly, and profit is the only reason why you'd keep going. My "hobby" mining setup is a mix of about 200W worth of hardware that I run off-peak (when electricity is cheapest).
My "semi-pro" mining setup is 3.8KW worth of hardware that I have co-located in a datacenter. Most people who are serious run even more hardware than that.
That's why hobby miners aren't really a big deal when it comes down to it.

* The 20nm Neptune chip, made by KnCMiner (0.54w/gh)
* The 55nm BF864C55, made by Bitfury. (0.5w/gh)
* The 55nm BM1382 chip, made by BITMAIN, achieves similar efficiency (0.77w/gh) to BE200. It should be underclockable to higher efficiencies.

@_date: 2014-08-09 18:35:07
Mining profitability was nowhere near equilibrium during the 2011 and 2013 crashes and the 2012 halving. That's why the network kept going: despite the halving of revenue a large percentage of miners were still making profit. The next halving will be different--that's OP's point. If mining revenue is near electricity cost at the time of the halving, which seems likely, then a catastrophic slowdown will occur. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 21:52:24
Why wouldn't they shut off their miners instead (therefore not taking the financial hit of operating at a loss) and wait for the difficulty to drop?

**First question. Woo!**
Moving average difficulty adjustment is a later innovation--it happens with a lot of altcoins. It wasn't built into the bitcoin protocol, however. Dogecoin, notably, had a hard fork in march 2014 to a moving average style difficulty adjustment--Although, this wasn't to protect from halvings. A lot of altcoins also have a system where the reward doesn't drop by half every four years, but by a tiny percentage *each block*, which ends up being equal to a 1/2 cut every four years, without those nasty shocks. 
**Now onto your second question.**
The first halving was a confusing time, but it's safe to say most of the network was GPU based at that time (I dug through bitcointalk ASIC shipping dates, and they all seem to be late january or even later). [Here's a profitability chart of the time right around the halving]( 
**Simplified example below** (doesn't factor in cpu/mobo power use, but the point should come across):
For some numbers, an AMD 7870 put out 485MH @ 157W. Plugging in those numbers on this chart, that card made $1.56/day revenue before the halving, and $0.78/day revenue after. However, margins were not tight at the time. At an average joe $0.15/kWh, the expenses of running a card like that were $0.56/day. Still profitable for the majority, and so the majority stayed. 
At the time of the first halving, margins were high enough that only ~10% of the network dropped off. However, as chip efficiency continues to plateau and the difficulty continues to approach equilibrium, most miners will find themselves on an equal playing field when the next halving hits. Do ya catch my drift?
Also, sorry if I sounded like an A-hole up there. I'm just a little bit frustrated with some people in this thread. :/

However, as the bitcoin inflation rate continues to half every four years, the energy cost will decline, as the new equilibrium is set lower every period--provided the price is constant (which it's anything but). 
Also, right now one of the biggest costs in mining is the cost of the chips. Electricity costs are significant, but even when added up over the usable lifetime of the hardware, they pale in comparison to the price of the miner itself. EG: Spondoolies Tech $6000 6TH/s rig draws ~3000w @ .46J/GH. It probably will be profitable for a year at most, as it will be quickly beaten by even more efficient rigs. The electricity costs, even at $0.15/kW/h add up to $3942 over a year. Most serious bitcoin miners pay much less than that. In Quebec electric costs are $0.06/kW/h, and in Washington State I've heard its $0.03/kW/h. A guy in washington will only pay $788 in electricity costs over the lifetime of his $6000 rig. If the usable lifespan of mining rigs continues to stay this short (with moores law holding up, it will somewhat), the equilibrium will be much lower than expected, as miners will need to factor in upfront costs.
All in all, the actual energy cost of the network is dependent on three things:
-The cost of purchasing a miner.
-The time it takes for that miner to be unprofitable.
-The amount of bitcoins being mined every day.

Miner here--$0.1/KWh is a little high for your electricity cost. Most big datacenters are located near cheap electricity. The colocation I use pays less than $0.06/KWh (Washington State). As well, industrial power costs in Quebec are very low, around $0.05/KWh in USD.

The standard for a very efficient miner (available for sale to the public, non-preorder) is a spondoolies sp35/KnC Neptune. They both do *about* 0.5w/gh at the wall. Bitfury, however, doesn't sell their miners to the general public. Their current gen chips are known to have similar efficiency to spondoolies/KnC chips, but they have the ability to underclock to an even higher efficiency if necessary (less hashrate, but much less power draw). 
Next generation chips are all speculation, but I'll just fire off the rumours being discussed in mining subforums. ASICMINER is estimating 0.3W/Gh by Q1 2014, Bitfury is speculated to produce 0.1W/GH in a few months [citation needed], and KnC is **claiming** an efficiency of 0.07W/GH with their next gen sometime in the future. Cointerra also claims to have a high-efficiency miner coming to market--but don't believe those assholes. 
Edit: Also, any hardware above 1.5w/gh is starting to become unprofitable to run, once you factor in hosting costs. My undervolted antminer s1s (running at 1.35w/gh @ 0.10/kwh), have about 70% of their revenue going to paying electricity costs.
@_date: 2014-12-09 21:48:18
Yeah, so what? "experts" will plan in a way where the halving is expected and manageable. 
* No they won't. It makes sense for them to run their rigs all the way up until the block reward halves, and then it suddenly doesn't make sense anymore. 
If less bitcoins are created, then the price of bitcoin will go up, and the profitability of mining will be saved!
* Look at dogecoin, they've had plenty of halvings like this, and their price didn't double because of them.  If this were true, it would always make sense to buy bitcoins before the halving and sell after. It would be a guaranteed get-rich-quick scheme.
@_date: 2014-12-09 21:40:17
You can mathematically calculate whether or not you will withstand the reward halvening, the serious players won't "test" to see if they still are. All the big farms that are suddenly unprofitable will shut down as soon as they become unprofitable (Which is exactly when the block reward halves). 


Although it seems like that's how it will work, that's not the effect the halving will have. All miners who have less of 50% of their revenue going to their electricity costs will remain, not 50% of all miners. I expect a very small percentage of miners to be running margins that big. IE most miners will be making close to the cost of electricity, and when their revenue is cut in half they will all drop off at once. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:58:06

Okay, I'll spell this baby out.
1) At the time of the halving mining revenue will be slightly greater than electricity cost. Maybe 10%, maybe 30%, but not much more. That's the nature of the competitive atmosphere of mining, it tends towards equilibrium.
2) When the halving happens, mining revenue cuts in half. The electricity costs do NOT cut in half. 
Therefore, and this isn't rocket science, it will not make sense to run your rig. You will not make profit. In fact, most people won't make profit. People will turn off their rigs, because their mining revenue is now LESS than their electricity costs. Nobody will rationally operate at a loss, and A HUGE fraction of the network will go offline, at once.

Nope, I doubt many miners are running with a 5cent/hour profit today. However, mining tends towards an equilibrium. Free market, yada yada.  Eventually, margins will be 5 or ten *percent*. As in, Bob's miner costs $100 worth of juice to run for a day, and prints out $110. Any rational person would still run that miner. Who wouldn't, for $10 profit per day. But when the halving comes, they will be printing $55, and their costs will be still $100. They'll turn off their machine, and so will most people. That's the whole issue that we're dealing with here: the aftermath when so many people turn off their rigs at the same time.

Every transaction a miner includes in a block increases the final size of the block. Larger blocks take longer to propagate to the entire network, and increase the chance of the block being orphaned. Therefore, it makes sense for miners to exclude no-fee transactions, as it will decrease their revenue in the long run (from the occasional orphaned block). 
That's one example of why people will stay pay fees without a block size limit. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 20:27:12
From Gavin's blog:
* “There is no need to raise the maximum block size right now, the average block size is only about 400,000 bytes.”
* “There is no need to raise the maximum block size because the Lightning Network / Sidechains / ChainDB / Treechains / Factom will solve the scaling problem.”
* “The network will be more secure with one megabyte blocks, because there will be more competition among transactions, and, therefore, higher transaction fees for miners.”
* “More transactions means more bandwidth and CPU and storage cost, and more cost means increased centralization because fewer people will be able to afford that cost.”
* “More transactions makes it more difficult to keep Bitcoin activity private from oppressive governments.”
* “Larger-than-one-megabyte blocks have had insufficient testing and/or insufficient research into economic implications and/or insufficient security review of the risks versus benefits.”
* “Any change that requires a hard fork will open up Pandora’s Box and destroy the confidence people have in the stability of Bitcoin; if the one megabyte maximum block size limit can be changed, why not the total number of bitcoins issued?”
* “I agree the max block limit must change, but why not do it THIS way instead?”

Miners that get 1W/GH are considered outdated at this point. You'll find that a "typical" BTC miner (Antminer S3, SP20, Prisma) all get ~0.7W/GH, and the more efficient miners are much closer to ~0.5W/GH. 
Electricity rates in WA, Quebec, Venezuela, Mongolia, Iceland, some parts of eastern europe etc are below $0.05 USD per kWH. There are few, if any, large scale mining operations in places with expensive electricity--it simply makes no sense if they can slash their biggest cost with a simple move. 
It's probable that Zeus' maintenance fees are 'exaggerated' so they can take more money from their customers, just like PETA.


If it the drop in price happens rapidly enough, a scenario with a huge increase in blocktime is possible. In a drastic case like this, a hardfork will be required to manually adjust the difficulty.

Yes, that's true, but more efficient miners are constantly being put online while less efficient miners are being taken offline. No major mining facilities


This is really nitpicky. Quebec &amp; Washington State are places where I've personally hosted miners, and I can vouch for prices being that low &amp; electricity supply being stable. If you're really interested, you can google it...


That's easy: charging additional maintenance fees means that they skim a few % extra profit every payout from their customers. Remember, these cloud mining companies control a very small percent of the bitcoin mining network anyway--BITMAIN, KnC, Bitfury, and SP-TECH have their own mining ops with their latest hardware and cheap power. 
I don't like the hardfork option very much. I think that if it is the case that a hardfork must happen, the difficulty algorithm should be changed to a moving average type system with minor corrections to diff each block. That should help mitigate the whipsaw effect.
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:09:39
Hmmm, aren't there altcoins that implement a minor difficulty adjustment *every* block based on a moving average of blocktime?
To be honest, that sounds the best way to do it. Why not hardfork to a system like that?
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:19:45
Yep, after the next difficulty adjustment it will be more like US $300.

You should do some more research into counterparty. All transactions in counterparty are bitcoin transactions (ie it would take a 3 cent fee to send 50 shares of examplecorp to another person, the fee going to the btc miner who finds the block the transaction is embedded in). That being said, there is a reason why they had to make a separate token! This is sorta complicated BTW, XCP isn't really a typical altcoin because it doesn't have a separate blockchain, as XCP are sent using the bitcoin network.
From their website:


For example, Storj (a really cool decentralized storage app) is an asset which is issued on counterparty. This isn't possible without the XCP token. 
There's no premine: XCP was distributed via proof-of-burn. I think a lot of people think that all altcoins are "scamcoins". While they're right with most of them (paycoin, 42coin, fedoracoin), I think that some have killer features to bring to the table. But that's just me. :)
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:15:20
They could be hiding the additional 21% of unknown hashrate, but no more. So its not possible that they're "hiding" 51% of the network, but a significant chunk of that is possible.

I'm pretty sure you goofed the numbers there. 90% of blocks are mined at current hashrate, which should take 12.5 days. If the remaining 10% (205 blocks) is mined at a 1% hashrate (each block is 16.5 hrs), then it would take 205*16.5 = 3382 hours or 140 days. 
The first 90% of blocks would take 12.5 days, the next 10% of blocks would take 140 days, meaning the total time taken is 152.5 days, which is *approximately* 10x longer than it should take. Thus, the difficulty will adjust down 90%.
But the difficulty doesn't work *exactly* that way. It can only decrease a maximum of 75%  and increase a maximum of 400% (hardcoded).

What I'm trying to get at here is that majority hashrate is not a good metric of user and economic consensus, which is required for a successful hardfork. That's why I don't like XT. 
Like said, it matters because it is a hardfork. That means that nodes that don't have XT will see new XT blocks as invalid, which is very very bad if many people haven't updated. For soft forks this isn't a problem.
There have been successful hardforks in the past, but absolutely everyone was on board when they happened. It definitely didn't happen like this. 
I totally agree that it is frustrating that the increase is taking so long.
And hell, if the blocksize debate gets bogged down enough, time to confirm and tx fees skyrocket, and people start ditching BTC on masse: Litecoin already has the equivalent of 4MB blocks and Dogecoin has the equivalent of 10MB blocks.

Most of these datacenters are dedicated entirely to mining (the biggest ones all are), but I agree this metric has big problems right now.
Take the 15MW HAOBTC estimate which is mostly a shot in the dark. I've heard they use Tubes/S3s (very old hardware), and that they are hashing around 10PH (makes sense with that hardware).
 
Their hashrate is probably lower than the 8.5MW icelandic bitfury operation and the 10MW KnC operation, but at least they are on the same order of magnitude. 
I find it very strange that nobody's actually tried to compile this list before!

At that point zero conf is fundamentally an honour system, like a candy bowl that says "please take one" on halloween, or a $20 cheque that you accept as payment for a similar bowl of candy (it could bounce).  Sure you can argue that the payoff of stealing the bowl is minor and it's "hard to do undetected", but there's absolutely no security provided by the system. More importantly, merchants are not going to *want* an inherently insecure payment method, because they will think they will lose a non-insignificant percentage of their sales to people defrauding them via double spend. That's a plausible fear right there. 
The only way right now to reliably accept a zeroconf is with a trusted third party &amp; multisig solution like greenaddress. RBF won't break that. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 08:02:16
No, that's not how the system is designed. If 75% of miners switched to XT tomorrow and XT "activated", my electrum wallet wouldn't give a flying fuck.
From my perspective, 75% of miners just dropped off the bitcoin network, and started mining XTcoin. Those blocks are rejected by my client, the nodes of all of my merchants, and the nodes of the vast majority of bitcoin users who have not switched to XT.
Miners do not determine what software people choose to run. It's bad design to base the XT switchover on hashrate alone. 
And remember, 75% of hashpower is likely held by five people in that image. They don't determine the blocksize themselves, neither do I: it needs to be almost everyone to be successful.

@_date: 2016-01-11 20:16:53


First off, it's not an upgrade, it's just a bunch of invalid blocks. 
I wouldn't switch if most users and my merchants were still using the lower hashrate fork--just like if peercoin's hashrate passed bitcoin's I wouldn't necessarily switch to peercoin. Hashrate really doesn't mean much if users don't agree, which is why hashrate is a bad metric to determine user adoption.
Most bitcoin companies and users are in favour of a block size increase. So am I, so are the core devs. That **does not** mean everyone is in favour of switching to XT and its system of governance. That's a weird assumption to make!


SPV clients do some verification, and if bitcoin XT blocks have a flag in their headers (I think they do?) I don't need to trust someone else to tell what blocks are valid or not. [SPV has some security measures already.]( If for some reason this fails, I can choose an electrum node that did not switch to the other chain. I can also verify that coins I send are not on the other chain by using a block explorer. I don't understand why using a light wallet is relevant, I personally don't have the bandwidth to run a full node.

It only activates if 75% of **miners** want it. 
75% of global hashrate is likely controlled by five people in this image. 
Those are the guys in charge of Avalon, Bitmain, Bitfury, BW, and KNC. All of these organizations run massive mines that each hold a large share (ranging from 5-20% each) of the network.
Bitfury's latest chip will greatly expand their (already massive) share of the network.

We don't know! It depends on the board bitfury makes. Sometimes you can get pretty close to chip level, sometimes you don't get anywhere near it.
Spondoolies SP20 had a chip level efficiency of 0.34w/gh, but the best their miner could do was around ~0.43w/gh at board level.
Still that reported spec is very good. The only chips that come close are the ones in the SP50, and that isn't up for public sale yet.

Namecoin is [merge mined]( with bitcoin and has existed since early 2011. It's also currently a useful product, too bad not many people use it.
Storj is built on Counterparty, which uses the bitcoin network directly to provide its security. It's partially working right now (driveshare works, but metadisk is in early alpha).
Mind you, I'm not 100% gung-ho for storj (I think crowdsales are pretty lame), but the fact that the devs are still working on it almost two years later gives it a bit of credibility.
I agree with you that the **vast** majority of altcoins are absolutely useless garbage.

Not true. 
The "switchover" would happen when 75% of **miners**, not users, decide to move to the new chain.
FYI it's likely that 5 people currently control/will soon control 75% of the network.
Is five people consensus? No.
@_date: 2016-01-19 15:01:21
Aha! I said entities, not pools. Bitfury for example isn't a pool, they actually control about 14% of the network--they physically own the hardware. Add KnC, MegaBigPower, and BW/Antpool (they operate a large datacenter in addition to the pool), and you get a scary percentage of the network controlled by 4 entities. Remember again that these aren't composed of individual miners. They outright have the hardware. 
Once you start factoring in a few medium sized players like HAOBTC, Lee Group, Avalon, and Spondoolies, you get past that 50% line very easily. 
There's only so many massive mines out there and the vast majority of them are controlled by those groups.

That's exactly what bitfury would say, and it's not true. Bitcoin mining is NOT decentralized, certainly not geographically or by entity.
**Geographic centralization:**
Bitcoin mining has been tending towards large datacenters owned by less and less people for the past few years now. There's really only six spots where mines are being run: Georgia (Country), Washington State (particularily in Chelan County), Inner Mongolia (Northern China), Tibet (Western-Central China), and Boden, Sweden. Labrador and Iceland get a participation medal for a couple of petahashes each, but they are small fry compared to the big fish. As an aside, namstec looks like they're going to get hashing in venezuela within a month, which is very interesting IMO. Their datacenter looks pretty neat. Still, we're only talking in terms of a few petahashes here, which is piss in the wind.
**Centralization by entity:**
Bitfury, BW/Antpool (they operate a large DC), MegaBigPower, and KnC control a scarily large percentage of the network. Throw in a few medium sized players like HAOBTC, Lee Group, Avalon (no data, but presumably big) and Spondoolies and I wouldn't be suprised if you're over 50% right there. 
For details about mining infrastructure see:

According to their bitcointalk account, this mine has capacity for 25MW worth of hardware, and is happily hashing away at 72PH/s--around 5% of the network. They used to use ASICMINER Tubes and Antminer S3s, but they recently upgraded to S7s. 
[It's the third largest publicly known mining operation in the world.](
@_date: 2016-06-30 19:50:56
Nope, 2-4MW isn't too big. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 19:46:59


Not really. 10PH is somewhere in the ballpark of 1-4MW using current-generation hardware.
MegaBigPower runs a 3MW and a 12MW mine in washington state, and is rumoured to also have a 32MW one in the works/already built.
C7 has a 10MW mine in Utah.
BlockC has a 10MW mine in California (probably).
Zoomhash has a 3MW mine somewhere in the US.
Spondoolies has/had (could still be operational even though they're bankrupt) a 3MW mine in North Carolina
There's probably a few more in the states, too. Here's my bct thread with more details on worldwide mining ops:

Home miners nowadays are a drop in the water. Their electricity is too expensive and their cost of acquiring hardware is too high to be able to compete.

Mining is trending towards centralization in three key areas: Manufacturing, geographic location, and hardware distribution. 
There are less and less ASIC manufacturers every year. China and Georgia have a huge chunk of the network. Two entities (Bitmain and Bitfury) control over 50% of the capacity of all publicly known bitcoin mines. Why do you think the trend is slowing?

Nope. The share of hobbyist miners is **continuously** decreasing, while farms are getting bigger and bigger. Bitmain just announced a 135MW farm the other day. That's over 100,000 antminer s9s.
A miner who mines just for fun will probably buy an antminer S7-ln. That will cost them a hundred bucks, then $3 a day to run at $0.16/kwh. They would only mine $1.50 a day, so they would be spending $1.50 a day to keep it running. That will add up to $550 a year if the difficulty stays the same. And of course, as the difficulty continues to march up, that profitability would get worse. And you'd need a million people blowing that much money on a boring hobby to equal the current hashrate. Good luck. With that.

That strategy would only work if a supermajority of miners collude, and it would make it very profitable to *not* collude. 
I doubt China has enough hashrate to pull it off profitably, even if every miner there colluded.

I don't think  is correct in claiming that bitcoin detractors are ignorant.
 criticisms of bitcoin:
1. Mining is growing increasingly centralized, year over year. 
2. When the block reward (eventually) runs out, [transaction fees won't necessarily provide enough incentive to secure the network.](
3. An abrupt halving in block reward every four years is a poor design decision, because it could cause almost every single miner on the network to become unprofitable at the same time. This scenario is only likely if all miners have tight profit margins--this has not happened the past two adjustments. Since the difficulty only adjusts every 2016 blocks, the amount of time for the next adjustment could be months instead of the typical two weeks.
# Honourable mention:
* Fungibility isn't perfect, and the anonymity provided by the system leaves something to be desired. However, the advantage of having weak anonymity is that the system scales a bit better.
Having these concerns is not the same as "not understanding technology," and I hope people 'round these parts understand that.
@_date: 2016-11-24 05:30:20


It won't be, because you're competing with other miners who aren't doing this attack. Those miners will fill blocks with your spam transactions, drive the average price down, and take your money!

There's only two ways I can think of to determine where mining comes from:
# The location of the pools:
 The top four pools are based in china. Between them is 75% of the network, but the problem here is that we don't actually know where that hashrate comes from. Antpool has mining servers all over the world: just because the pool is owned by a chinese company doesn't mean that all, or even most, hashrate comes from china. 
The largest pool that publicly posts stats on where hashrate comes from is Slush. Slush is not representative of overall hashrate distribution, but the breakdown (if you're curious) is this:
* Chinese servers: 3PH/s
* European servers: 50PH/s
* American servers: 70PH/s
Note: Even though this pool is based in the Czech Republic, most hashrate comes from another continent. It seems dangerous to assume that if the pool is based in country x, the miners must be based in country x.  
# The location of the farms:
The problem here is that many miners don't want to publicly reveal where they store millions of dollars worth of very shiny equipment. However, if we go by [this list of publicly known mining operations]( (made by yours truly), we can see that mining farms are clustered in: 
1. China
2. Georgia
3. Washington State, USA
4. Labrador, Canada
5. Quebec, Canada
# Conclusions:
It's my opinion, as a seasoned armchair analyst, that China holds a plurality but not majority of hashrate. I also wouldn't be surprised if 90% of mining occurs in just three regions: Georgia, Washington State, and China.

Take a look at the cuckoo cycle. It is memory intensive, and is very light on cpu usage. Essentially, this algorithm is bound by the total amount of ram in a system. 


differences across hardware architectures, and make mining—the process of looking for proofs—on
commodity hardware cost-effective. This is to be achieved by making main memory latency a bottleneck,
since DRAM latencies have remained relatively stable while cpu-speed and memory bandwidth
vary highly across hardware architecture and process technology.

None of you guys are mentioning the real reason why they've dramatically shrunk.
Some users on bitcointalk did a statistical analysis on a few months worth of pool stats. It turns out that ghash.io had ~90% luck over that time. Since it was taken over such a long time period it's not possible the discrepancy was due to variance--instead it appears that ghash was "skimming off the top" of miner rewards. IE every block in a while they collect for the pool operator, and no rewards go to the miners. Essentially, a 10% secret fee.
Since people caught wind of that their market share has declined.

Yes, you can *potentially* mine with any computer. See the FAQ for details on this. I also made [an infographic]( about how terrible GPU mining is, and CPU mining is worse!
You can set most CPU mining software to only use one core of your processor. This will have no effect on your computer's performance unless you are really working hard. Seriously though, the amount that can be gained from CPU mining is practically ZILCH! Remember when I said 4500 r9 290s will mine about $12 a day? Well, it will take about 40 000 cpus on one core to mine $12 a day--about $0.0003 per day per cpu. It will take almost 10 years of nonstop mining to make a dollar with only one computer!
If you want, I have some used USB ASIC mining hardware that you can mess around with. They aren't a huge step up, and you may never meet the minimum payout threshold for most services, but they have cool flashing lights.

Actually, they do keep the proceeds from mining! Bitfury manufactures hardware and builds datacenters, they don't run a public pool. All the hashrate you see in the "Bitfury pool" is owned and operated by bitfury, similar to KNC's mining op.

In practice, double spends are possible and happen. They just aren't too common--that doesn't mean that unconfirmed transactions are secure.
If you want secure unconfirmed transactions you'll have to use multisig with a trusted third party.

Buy coffee from a merchant running a node in London, with a transaction broadcasted from your node in London. 
The merchant sees your transaction and gives you your coffee.
1 second later broadcast a double spend in beijing. That should propagate just far enough: the main nodes of the biggest 3 chinese pools. Boom! 65% chance of success that your doublespend will work.
However, since doublespends are not relayed (most nodes work on a first-seen basis, although this will change), the merchant (along with most of the world, given that 1 second advantage) will still see your transaction as unconfirmed until the next block is published. 
This type of attack is "free" (it costs the attacker nothing), its relatively easy to automate, and has a high chance of success. You can make success even more likely by broadcasting multiple double spends from nodes "right next to" the nodes of all the big mining pools. Once automated I would argue that this type of attack is actually **easier** than robbing a house with no door. 
I hope you see how accepting unconfirmed transactions is bad practice.
@_date: 2015-11-02 01:31:19
We know for sure that Bitfury controls 15% of the network, KnC controls 6%, and 21 Inc controls 4%. 
We don't know how much hardware bitmain or spondoolies has, because they mine on public pools (bitmain probably makes up a large chunk of antpool, they have a massive datacenter).
I think it's plausible that bitmain, spondoolies, and bitfury together control around 40-50% of the network. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 21:32:54
Bear with me here:
There's no way to tell if one transaction was sent before another, if they both have no confirmations. 
Let's say bob sends a double spending transaction A and B, B having a slightly higher fee. A was broadcasted from a node in london and B was broadcasted from a node in beijing 1 second later. It takes a few seconds for a transaction to propagate fully, so many nodes receive A first (because A was sent slightly earlier), but some nodes receive B before A gets to them. 
A miner then publishes a block including transaction B instead of A. How do we know whether or not the miner got A first, but then sneakily performed RBF (for those sweet extra txfees) or simply operates a node that received transaction B first?
We don't know!

That is not the same thing as security. If my house has no door, and only one in a hundred people who pass by it steal from it, that doesn't mean my house is 99% safe. Why? Because it offers zero protection against bad actors.
Likewise, unconfirmed transactions have no protections against bad actors from abusing it. The protection built into bitcoin against double spend attacks is the blockchain--**take that away and you have no protection.** No confirmations = No security

The consensus rules for bitcoin are an important concept. For example, if bitcoin core enabled support for putting text into OP_RETURN (which AFAIK core cannot do right now), it would not modify the existing consensus rules. Old clients would still accept those new transactions as valid, because 
Meanwhile, for a 2MB block, it requires all users to update their clients. Otherwise, old users would regect the new blocks as invalid. 
RBF falls into the former category instead of the latter, so we can say it does not change the consensus rules.
All it does, in a nutshell, is make it easier for miners to arbitrarily "choose" transactions based on fee. It's already allowed for miners to do this, this just makes it easier for users to broadcast these transactions and miners to accept these transactions into blocks.

BIP-101 requires a "hard fork": All clients must update to support this BIP or there will be a chain fork.
However, RBF doesn't require a hard fork because it doesn't modify consensus rules. For more info about *why* that is the case, here's a previous post I made about it (which I've since made a bit more readable):

All RBF transactions are valid under current consensus rules, its just that some clients don't support **sending** them, just like some clients don't support adding arbitrary data to OP_RETURN, for example. It doesn't matter if 99.9% of users have no way to send data via OP_RETURN, it still is valid according to miners and j
Even if everyone had non-rbf clients and only one dude and one pool had an rbf client, that one dude's RBF transaction would be totally valid provided that pool mined the next block. 
Same goes for OP_RETURN, too. 
Bottom line is that it's the **miner's decision** whether or not to include **any valid transaction** into the next block. They can already discard an arbitrary transaction and replace it with a higher or lower fee equivalent, provided they mine the next block. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 20:59:27
Credit card transactions aren't safe either (significant chance of fraud), and businesses still accept them. Sometimes organizations make a decision to sacrifice security for convenience. In my opinion, that's a bad practice.
There are ways to make zero-conf work with third parties and multisig (if you're interested hit me up), but with a conventional zero-conf transactions vendors **should not** be accepting them. That might not stop them, but eventually they will get burned.
If you want to know *why* regular zero conf is unsafe, then I can show you a couple of good resources that walk through it technically.

Incoming speculation:
Physical infrastructure isn't too important IMO. Services like circle/coinbase that make it easier to purchase coins can seriously cut into ATM profitability. Why walk down the street to an ATM if you can buy coins with a credit card for lower fees? Not enough users are interested in the greater anonymity to justify running the ATMS, I guess.
Vault of Satoshi is sadly just an exchange that never got a decent market share. Their volume was never amazing. Too bad, they were my favourite though.
Lots of cool things coming down the pipe though. Hardware wallets are now becoming mainstream, some cool applications for bitcoin tech have *working* proof-of-concepts (think storj, counterparty, and openbazaar), and expanded merchant acceptance.

I find it funny how the  stock photo for bitcoin is always a picture of a Block Erupter USB mining setup. For those not into mining, the Block Erupter USB is one of the first ASICs developed for bitcoin mining. One of those little guys makes 2.1 cents a month in revenue... To achieve the same hashrate as an antminer S7, you would require 13813 BE's, for a total power draw of 34.5KW. They are nothing more than fun collectibles at this point!

The equivalent of a 51% attack in the traditional banking system would be a coalition of telecom companies deciding to mess with the communications infrastructure.
Banks would not be able to effectively communicate with each other. Telcom companies could block random transactions at will, but would not be able to empty the accounts of users.
However, this analogy is not very good, because the modern financial industry works off the concept of centralized ledgers. The double spend problem, then, is simply not applicable, much like how the problem of the weight of the money you're carrying slowing you down is not applicable to bitcoin.

Unconfirmed transactions are fundamentally unsafe. If they were safe, we wouldn't need a blockchain. 
There's absolutely no reason to act like they are, unless you want to get caught with your pants down. Conceptually, implementing RBF is a good thing because it will get rid of this misconception (plus it adds a useful feature!).

Difficulty can't drop in the middle of a 2016 block cycle, it is ONLY adjusted once the cycle completes. 
If *everyone* jumps on when the difficulty drops the maximum amount, then you will see extremely fast blocktimes, and a massive upwards increase in difficulty at the next adjustment! Hence the "seesaw effect".
I hope you see what I'm trying to get at. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 02:32:43
This is sort of complicated but here's the best I could do:
Replace By Fee allows miners to easily accept a higher fee transaction over a lower fee transaction from the same output (it allows them to decide whether or not to allow a double spend). However, this is not a change in the consensus rules of bitcoin--remember, according to the rules **miners can already arbitrarily include any valid transaction they want into a block, even a double spend.** Ghash.io maliciously double spent in the past against gambling sites--they presumably used a modded client (as the regular client "won't let you", even though it still is possible).
All this does is implement it into the client, so users can "request" miners to override their transaction. It doesn't require a hardfork/softfork or any fork, it just needs a single client to request it and a single miner to deliver. 
RBF already exists (IIRC) in some alternative bitcoin clients, so this doesn't exactly change the game. 
Zero conf transactions aren't safe and never were intended to be safe, because there's no way to actually **ensure** they will be safe. It's better to get rid of that misconception now rather than later. 
There are ways to add some security to zero conf (interestingly, by using third party services and multisig), but that requires some trust. I can elaborate a little if you want!
@_date: 2015-11-28 21:17:36


I didn't say that they were 99% safe, or 50% safe, or somewhat safe, or mostly safe.  I said they **weren't safe.**
Unconfirmed transactions fundamentally have the same level of protection against double spends as a store with no staff that operates on the honour system for payment has protection against theft. Sure, 90% of customers wouldn't steal from them, but that doesn't mean the store has '90% security'.
Businesses simply should not accept regular unconfirmed transactions. It's a bad practice.
The mechanism to protect against double spend attacks in bitcoin is called the blockchain. Unconfirmed transactions don't have this.

Why would hashrate fall? It would be still profitable to mine all the way up to the halving. People will **not** shut down their miners if they are making a profit, even if they anticipate an upcoming halving.
The problem is that the halving is a sudden shock, and the network difficulty adjustment can't adjust to sudden shocks. 


Not true anymore. Operating costs are much larger than upfront costs of equipment. IE it costs much more to power, service, and secure an antminer S5 (over the course of its lifetime) than it costs to build or buy one. This is a trend. 


No. Efficiency is irrelevant. We're talking about margins here! A bitcoin miner that makes $1 USD per day in 2013 (A USB Block Erupter) pulled 2.5w out of the wall (costs practically nothing). Huge margin!
An Antminer S5 makes $2.39 USD per day drawing 590W. That means that to get a revenue of $1 per day today, you need ~250w of power with typical equipment. That's 100 times more electricity than 2013 per dollar, making operating costs much higher and margins much lower. That's been a continuous trend for the past year. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 13:09:32
Heads up:
It's generally best practice to wait for a confirmation on a transaction that big before completing your transaction--especially because the fee is so low. I know, I know, hindsight is 20/20. 
People who tell others its safe to accept zero-conf transactions are silly.
The best you can do now is contact the sender and ask them to resend with a higher fee. If they refuse, you are screwed. :(
@_date: 2015-10-06 12:34:09
A chance, yes!
More likely is a difficulty "seesaw"! That's when the blocks immediately slow after the halving to a crawl (lets say 15% the normal rate), and at the next difficulty adjustment the diff drops the maximum amount  (75%) to 25% the current difficulty.
All of a sudden bitcoin mining is very profitable and blocks are found much faster as all the old mining hardware is turned back on. That makes blocks found way quicker than usual, and spikes the difficulty again. Rinse, repeat. 
Note that this has happened before, altcoins and pool hopping many times before.
@_date: 2015-10-15 00:50:40
Nothing can be instant! Maximum speed of causality is 300,000km/s. :)
Transactions are broadcasted through the network in a few seconds, right now if the fee is high enough and you monitor the network for double spends, you can be *fairly* confident in a 0-conf transaction (provided most pools don't implement RBF), in about 10s, but nothing is certain until a few confirmations. This requires special care though, and most users/wallets don't do this/implement this, which makes this moot. Mycelium local trader and bitpay both have that feature though, its pretty neat!
If you use a pseudo-centralised service like greenaddress you can be even more confident in a 0-conf transaction. I can elaborate if you're interested, it is very cool!
Compared to the legacy banking system though, bitcoin is (fundamentally) better, but in practice, it has both advantages and disadvantages.

Actually, a coffee shop shouldn't take a 0 confirmation txn without additional security steps. It's trivial to do a doublespend via [replace-by-fee]( A better way to do near-instant transaction is through 2of2 multisig with a third party, like greenaddress (you can't doublespend because greenaddress refuses to sign with their key for doublespends).

Note that a single wallet can hold many keys, especially if it is an HD wallet. A wallet containing 10k BTC could have 500, 1k, 1.5k, 5k, and 2k BTC in different addresses. It is generally good security practice never to reuse addresses or collect all funds into a single address.

The cost of building, staffing, and powering a datacenter is not low. Mining revenue will tend to an equilibrium with operating costs, as improvements in ASICs steadily slow. We've actually been seeing this over the past few generations of hardware, power requirements for miners are scaling up and up compared to their USD revenue.  
Miners with a 75% margin the day before the reward slash (IE operating costs are $1, revenue is $1.75) will become unprofitable at the halving. That's just math. If most miners are below that mark by then, which is definitely **possible** if the trend continues, then blocktimes will slow horrendously and you will see a difficulty seesaw. It just makes sense to turn off your miners if they are steadily burning away your cash reserves. The bitcoin difficulty adjustment method has no way to cope with large shocks to the system, this happened with altcoins a lot before they implemented moving average based difficulty adjustments. 


Unless you can explain **how** that will cause the above not to happen, then your handwaving "the market will fix it" response doesn't contribute to the discussion.

@_date: 2015-10-06 15:35:36
Yes, bitcoin has halved before!
Altcoins used to copy bitcoin's difficulty algorithm, but then transitioned to moving average based implementations because of the mass pool hopping. Developers have already realized that the current bitcoin difficulty adjustment has trouble adjusting to sudden shocks!


However, mining revenue was not close to operating costs at the time, the greatest cost was upfront investment in hardware. Even the moment after the halving, most miners were still making a profit and had no reason to shut off their rigs.
It's only a recent trend that mining margins have dropped so low--bitcoin mining is a different ballgame from 2012. Operating costs are now the biggest expense in running a mine.


I don't appreciate you dismissing my opinion as FUD. It actually is **uncertain** what will happen at the halving, but there is definitely a possibility of a seesaw happening. For example, if the bitcoin price triples right before the halving, this will be a non-issue as miner margins will be huge when it hits. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 16:45:11

No, the goal here is "security" in general. Unconfirmed transactions simply have **no protection at all against double spending**. That's the whole reason there's a blockchain in the first place: a solution to the double spending problem.


Unconfirmed transactions don't have "probabilistic" security in the same way a transaction with 1 confirmation does. 
An unconfirmed transaction doublespend can be pulled off with a fixed good chance of success (when done properly), and doesn't
require the perpetrator to perform a costly POW "race". This means that attempting this type of doublespend is "free". It doesn't cost the attacker anything.
A doublespend on a confirmed transaction, on the other hand, is practically impossible to achieve without a large percentage of network hashrate, quite a bit of luck, and the willingness to lose a huge amount of your mining revenue.
If you want to reverse a 1-conf transaction, you'd need to mine the next two blocks faster than the rest of the network, and you'd also lose the block reward from those blocks you mined--costing you 50BTC!

Just never use a photocopier to back up your wallet, use a Linux livecd to generate the wallet offline, store all your copies of your paper wallet in safes bolted to the floor (or use BIP0038 and memorize a secure password). Easy? Sure, if you're extremely computer literate. 
Not many people are...

Are we sure that a overnight 50% reduction in miner income is a good idea?
Could this massive shock to the ecosystem cause a difficulty seesaw effect?

The only way we'll end up with evidence is if Bitmain makes a public announcement of their share of the network. They haven't, so all we can do is estimate. 
Bitmain operates a cloud mining service called Hashnest, which claims a speed of ~17.5PH, about 4% of the network. They also have a large self mining operation, funded by their pacmic contracts (plus outside investments), but the size of that operation is unknown.
Bottom line, though, is that nobody except bitmain knows for sure.

Note that miners **already** have the right to choose which transaction in a double spend they want to include in a block. Many choose the first one they see, a small number have implemented RBF (there's gotta be a couple of p2pool miners doing it)--but there's no way to force miners to do it one way or the other.

What's your power cost? If you give me that I can break this down for you a little better.

VoS did get volume from altcoins though...
They even delisted the altcoins that stopped getting volume... I don't think its fair to say they listed a crapton of scamcoins. 
EDIT: was pretty convincing here, my view has since changed.

Well... listing AUR does sound sketchy. Consider my mind changed.
Sorry for being rude up there, reddit gets heated sometimes. ;)

Note that it costs nothing for miners to create maximum sized blocks no matter what transaction fee is required (if they never broadcast the transaction and only include it in blocks they mine).
They'll receive their own transaction fee back.

I'm pretty sure most mines aren't located in places with power that expensive! I once tried to index where datacenters are located, and you can see a trend of miners flocking to cheap power :)
@_date: 2015-10-02 20:37:09
Shorter blocktimes increases the percentage of orphaned blocks (reducing confidence in a single confirmation), and requires miners to have lower latency.
There is a tradeoff to it.
@_date: 2016-07-25 21:22:49
Good thing serious miners pay *far* lower than $0.11/KWH for power. ;)

Er, if Bitfury is trending up and hashrate is steady, that means others *must* be decreasing. That's just math.
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:27:52
Hey again, its me from the thread! 0.07 w/GH is the efficiency of the chip itself, you're going to get significant power loss through the board. SP-Tech ROCKERBOX chips are rated at 0.36w/GH while their best miner can only barely touch 0.5.
As well, 0.07w/GH is *claimed* by KnC, which isn't exactly the most reputable mining hw manufacturer. Lots of broken promises and faulty hardware from those guys. Bitfurys claim of 0.1 w/GH, and AMs claim (with pics and actual testing) of 0.2 with BE300S are much more credible IMO.

Note that while ~$0.0389 USD/KWh is pretty cheap, a few WA counties are still a bit cheaper and Labrador industrial customers pay a tad under $0.02 USD/KWh. 
Although this is an interesting development, it certainly isn't groundbreaking!
@_date: 2016-07-26 04:34:26
I have around 300MW worth of capacity indexed. Assuming 0.35w/gh as a network efficiency average (big assumption, but whatever), that's about ~~100PH/s~~ 1000PH/s, so call it around two thirds?
I'm guessing the remaining third is probably in china--but it could be Georgia too. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 04:58:57
Bitfury has been a scary mining giant for *years*...
@_date: 2016-07-27 00:20:39
Sorry, I definitely dropped a zero there. It's 1000PH/s. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 03:59:37
FPGAs, yes. ASICs were just coming online at that time, so perhaps.
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:04:30
Multiply the current hashrate in PH by 0.65 (Roughly the mean efficiency MW/PH of HW on the network) to get the power consumption in MW. My quick and dirty arithmetic gives me ~210MW. That should be about it, plus or minus 30%. 
For comparison, the Palo Alto nuclear plant produces about 15x this, a very large wind farm about 3x this, and a coal plant (varies of course) about 5x this. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 21:21:19
No, it's probably the older &gt;0.5W/GH hardware becoming unprofitable and going offline. 
No big deal, IMO. Downward difficulty swings can only be a serious problem when they are EXTREME. Even 30% downwards isn't extreme in my books, and this looks like it's going to be 5-10. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 04:02:18

Well, that's pretty easy. Avalon is the oldest mining ASIC manufacturer in the business. If anything, you should be asking if Bitmain is a subsidiary of Avalon, because at least that wouldn't require a time machine!

I pay $0.06/KWH to host my miners in Labrador, Canada--and that's after my colocator takes their cut. 
The biggest places for bitcoin mining (in rough order of popularity) are:
 * Northern and Western China (one rate I saw was $0.0384/KWH)
 * Georgia (the country), where Bitfury is close to the local government and we don't know how much they pay.
 * WA, USA (a hair under $0.04/KWH in a few counties)
 * Labrador, Canada (Industrial rates go below $0.02/KWH)
@_date: 2016-07-22 04:58:10
There are USA based mining datacenters. MegaBigPower has a pretty massive one, blockc and zoomhash are also substantial. There's around a half dozen more medium-small mining outfits in the states!

The S7 is still an extremely profitable miner at a decent electricity cost.
The hardware coming offline right now is &gt;0.5W/GH stuff: SP20/3X miners, s5s, and KnC's neptunes. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 23:16:22
If you want something decent but cheap, go for an S7-LN. It comes with a PSU and runs fairly quiet for a bitmain miner. It'll get you 2.7TH/s @ 770w. You can probably find one for $250 USD shipped. 
Otherwise, you could try picking up a spondoolies SP20, and downclocking the shit of it, which should get around 1TH/s @ 500w. That's going to be even quieter than the s7-ln, and cost you around $50 USD. 
If you're **really** poor, pick up an antminer S3, S3+, or S3++. That shit's gonna be dirt cheap, 0.5TH/s @ 275-375W (depending on model).
The SP20 and S3/+/++ miners don't come with PSUs so you'll have to buy them separately or in a package with the units. 
What's your power rate like?
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:16:51
Actually, Ghash.io is **not** a private company. It's just a mining pool, like any other. Anyone who has a cex.io account (Like me, a small time miner) can join the pool. I even have an account! Although it is technically a private pool, it is one in the most vague of senses. 
However, the largest entity in this pool is Bitfury (They also operate the pool). Last I heard on bitcointalk, they had 200-300 THs, which is a significant, but not massive, amount of global hashpower (~5800THs and climbing). 
The second largest entity is ASICMINER, which holds about 1% of the network (90THs).

These cards have zero resale value if GPU mining profitability tanks (which is possible) because they are useless for gaming. 
They don't even provide a huge advantage for mining: a miner's biggest cost is their power bill. Over two years a KW of gpus at a $0.10/KWh will cost $1752. There's no increase in efficiency here over consumer grade hardware, and the few bucks you'll save upfront to not have a displayport/hdmi/dvi are nothing compared to the hit to your hardware's resale value.
At least in the darkest days of the dogecoin bust and rise of scrypt asics back in 2014 you could always turn around and fence your cards on craigslist...
I doubt these will sell as much as AMD/Nvidia hope because of this.
