I have a friend that has $300,000 locked up with GDAX right now. He waits on hold for 3 hours every day to talk to their support staff and they refuse to reenable his account

Yeah except it's near impossible to utilize right now...

Here's a better source because I do concede that Vice is generally trash. This states the average transaction consumes 294 kWh of electricity. Let's imagine for a second that Bitcoin becomes the secure, global, decentralized currency of the future we all dream of and thus the network processes 100 Billion transactions a day. 100 Billion * 294 kWh means Bitcoin miners will consume 29.4 Trillion kWh per day. That is an absurd amount of electricity. The way Bitcoin is structured with its Proof of Work algorithm today **cannot** and will not scale to a network of that size. Bitcoin will have to find a way to deal with its energy consumption if it's ever to become something that everyone and their grandma uses. I'm sure people much smarter than you and I will find out how to do this without sacrificing security and the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is relatively small now. If we have 10x the number of transactions this changes. I think mining power consumption is definitely an issue that needs to be addressed.

We'll know soon enough!!

not the best of sources but it's something:

I think most people would suggest the exchange GDAX. Make sure you go to gdax.com, and not gdaxbtc.com or some other phishing site.

If you research the amount of energy required to confirm a single bitcoin transaction you would be astounded  
**Edit:**  not the best source but it's something

I never said energy was being *wasted* per se, but I'm sure consensus and security could be made to be more energy efficient. Then again, I'm not an electrical engineer or computer scientist. I can anticipate a lot of groups opposing Bitcoin simply on the basis of its energy consumption as it grows and achieves widespread adoption.

Bitcoin protocol can be changed. Also, off chain transactions are a thing. You clearly don't understand how much electricity 29.4 Trillion kWh/day is. If you want Bitcoin to succeed you need to recognize it is not perfect or scalable in its current state. It's just a fact

Hate to be that guy but this rocket is nowhere near big enough to take anything to the moon
