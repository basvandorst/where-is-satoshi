Yeah but their heads don't need to be in a pool filled with Starbucks coffee....
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:14:24
Yeah that is unaccepatable, but I hope you're joking.

Go Satoshi! 
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:19:40
Yeah that would actually be frigging awesome :)
@_date: 2014-10-12 17:15:23
The irony is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:33:17
 :)
@_date: 2014-10-12 17:16:11
And they are?
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:01:06
Although that is a fucking shitload, he has over 120,000 BTC from selling satoshi dice :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:28:32
Haha yeah :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:57:56
Wow this is cool!
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:12:53
No, fuck you. It's not bitcoin's fault you don't know how to securely store your money.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:40:11
No problem man, if you've got any more questions, don't ask me cos I don't know shit haha
@_date: 2014-03-17 02:01:56
Dude you're going to break @_date: 2014-10-01 01:40:49
That is new kinds of fucked up. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:22:31
This. Seriously this is exactly what I don't know. Do you know where I could learn about this? Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:26:10
Great will have to check out bitstamp and armory! :)
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:12:16
Thanks man! :D
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:19:59
That is a great point! Will defintely do that should we invest :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:21:53
Well she and my dad both have full time jobs and the 25k was a gift, so losing 1/5th of that wouldn't hurt us too much. I'm still wary about the securest way to store the bitcoins and set up a secure wallet!
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:54:33
That's actually some great advice thanks, I think I do need to read up on it and research it before dropping such a huge sum, thanks :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:33:12
Well to be honest, it was a gift to which she was going to put into a savings account, with a small interest, I suggested she check out bitcoin since the price is rising at a ferocious rate, and we are entering the digital age, to which hopefully bitcoin will become the standard currency. I mean that doesn't sound too stupid to me, but each to his own. But you're right about being very unknowledable about bitcoin, do yo know where I could read up on it? :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:11:32
Thanks man I think you're right. It's not all she has, but it's quite a huge sum of money to me and her! :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:19:03
I have absolutely no qualms about doing that, she just recieved the money and was going to put it in a savings account, one where she would recieve £5000 in 5 years, I simply suggested she explore other options, maybe take a bit of a gamble, since she can afford to lose 1/5th of it :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:51:18
Why the fuck would I troll? I just prefer that spelling. Douche
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:15:19
That's exactly what I'm saying, she has a full time job and as does my dad, she just recieved that money as a gift (from her mom for selling their house if you really want to know!) so she doesn't depend on it. But yeah I think I definetely need to get to grips with bitcoin. Where should I start? Thanks man!
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:12:02
I think that's a great way to look at it, though just the surge in the price of bitcoins has been insane. Honestly it's crazy. Thanks for some useful advice! :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:26:18
Awesome idea!
