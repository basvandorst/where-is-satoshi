the developers are very friendly with the bitcoin foundation (controlled by corporate interests who are known to have conspired secretly on their forums to try and regulate bitcoin in a centralized manner) and members, gavin has met with the cia off the record and the CFR (CFR is where the presidents are choosen according to historians, hillary clinton is on record saying she takes orders from them). The mods/admins have quite a bit of money yet the forum is shit and always getting hacked. the top developers are paid by the bitcoin foundation (the bitcoin foundation is VERY wealthy, in the old days it was 50btc to register, and i think it still is for a lifetime membership). on the bitcoin forums they have allowed butterfly labs, a known scam with 280+ complaints/lawsuits coming at them, to advertise. 
these are some of the problems and symptoms regarding the centralization of the developers. If theymos or someone who hacked his computer wanted to crash the bitcoin price he could very easily do it himself. I think this community would not want to give one person that ability when it is not necessary. your question of how it is centralized... theymos controls the forum, the lead dev's have an alert key, the lead devs on github can allow changes to the source code and updates
bitcoin is not centralized itself but the way it is programmed is, theres no big weakness with how bitcoin is programmed dont get me wrong, but technically it is centralization. again we are talking about centralization of developers not of bitcoin code itself.
