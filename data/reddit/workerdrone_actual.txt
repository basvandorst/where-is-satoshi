Assuming you're asking about the IRS, you don't need to declare any purchases of any crypto with your after tax dollars.
You do need to report any sales of crypto or crypto to crypto trades.
IMO, an accountant is always worthwhile and they usually pay for themselves by getting you a better return or a smaller tax bill due.  But also you get the extra layer of security in case of questions or audit - "you'll have to ask my accountant, I don't really understand the tax laws, just doing my best to comply"

Not that it'll stay this way forever, USD exchange rate is brutal for MX right now, but been sitting in the Yucatan for past 6 weeks and not missing the US one bit.  The best people!  Great dining, feel very safe in my location (a lot safer than I've felt in a bunch of cities back in USA), good wifi everywhere, etc.  Gonna be tough going back to grumpy people and eye watering USD/Euro prices haha
Geographic arbitrage FTW

Not sure how it works outside the US, but inside, Coinbase pro deposits back to my bank account in just a day or two.
Definitely use pro if you can not the Coinbase app, as others said the fees are far lower.
Also if you keep your limited funds on Coinbase and enable whitelisting it's probably safer than a lot of other storage methods.  It's even insured.  No privacy, but should be pretty safe.

Helps if you list your country but wut?  Who mails in cash there is no recourse for it disappearing in the mail.
If USA Coinbase pro (not Coinbase) is fairly low fee and easy in, easy out.
Bitcoin ATMs, BTC meetups, Local Bitcoins....
I sell stuff for BTC on Craigslist sometimes

No, wallet transfers are not taxable events, only going from one currency to another (trades).
Gains will be taxed just like trading stocks, either short term or long term capital gains rates.  But there are several strategies possible to use - recommend using an accountant familiar with this.
