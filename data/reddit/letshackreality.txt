Nah man I think I got it:
* The US government is fake, it's a fraud. It's a for-profit corporation, created by lawyers.
* The entire world is turning on the fake government of the US, isolating them. It's game over for them. Even individual politicians are having to quickly choose reality vs fiction.
* Federal Reserve Notes are worth nothing. We've all been victims of a HUGE fraud. But in an extraordinary act of kindness, the nations of the world are reaching out the the American public and offering to exchange gold notes for our Federal Reserve Notes.
* The new gold notes will be legit, and probably be our global "base currency". We can still use Bitcoin, doge, lite, etc as additional currency where it's more convenient, secure, profitable, whatever. Up to us.
* **A non-human race called the Nephilim are behind this whole deception. Ya rly.**
* The whole media system -- literally a false reality -- is crumbling. It will be up to us to create our own culture, our own music, our own movies, our own "programming".
* Holy shit what a time to be alive!

So what's the bankster play? Moving from a private fiat currency to a public gold-backed currency puts a big dent in their control system.

It's not a conventional popular revolt; it appears to be at a national level. Countries are leaving fiat currencies for the gold-backed Chinese Yuan of the BRICS alliance. Whether that's another bankster trap is another question. But that implies the USD and other fiat currencies are in for a crash, and I'm hearing this *everywhere*. 
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have a role to play here, maybe just a temporary role but a role nonetheless.
