looks like 27 s9s, each s9 producing about 2k/mo right now. so around $54k per month in btc from that setup I guess. Probably around or under $3k in power cost.  ...who said personal mining was dead?

The deep technical discussions are more vibrant than ever!! You mostly wont find them on reddit or twitter though (thankfully). Too many muggles and trolls on those platforms. Interesting technical discussions are usually project specific, presented at conferences/papers, or in improvement proposals. Just watch some of the conference or meetup vids and go on to read the papers that are interesting. Go slow, its deep now.

Bitcoin is a protocol with many implementations, not a consumer device. We still have tcp, ip, udp, http, bgp, and such from the early days of the internet.

dollar cost average in, dollar cost average out (only if you need to, bitcoin is a great deflationary store of value). "all at once" usually is a bad idea, especially for large amounts.

if you don't have money but are interested, invest your time in learning about it and related topics. you'll find that knowledge is just as valuable as money in many different ways and more durable. money is ultimately just a representation of value, if you make yourself more valuable, money will come.

Miners pay millions to compete, its different and enforced because lots of people can run nodes to validate their work. If only a few organizatioms can validate blocks and vote on consensus rules then one competition will be to see who can devalue bitcoin the fastest by dilluting the supply and enriching themselvss, killing the currency. The other competition that will take place will be governments rushing to put the few remaining node operators in jail or confiscating their assets, killing the currency and protecting their own ability to print money and enrich themselves. The bitcoin security balance is more delicate than most people understand.

This blog post proposes building a large centralized resource to validate blocks. If we are all going to trust something a group of other people maintain without being able to reproduce and validate it ourselves, just use a database and save 1.3M a year. Whats the point?

peaks can only be identified in retrospect. trading or trying to predict the market is a quick way to lose your bitcoin and a painful lesson. DCA is a solid strategy.

Bitcoin isnt about replicating the old system.

Yes. This makes sense. Premature block size increases would break censorship resistance just at a time when governments will try to block or destroy bitcoin.

I didnt assume. The blog post did that. My point was that the blog lost author is incredibly stupid and unable to see basic flaws in their reasoning. Its almost as stupid as assuming that adoption will follow hardware performance increases which our current human knowledge of materials and physics dont support. Yes, 1tb every 10 minutes will be too much and zero confirmation transactions are a really dumb idea.  We have a viable approach to instantaneous second layer and the only people missing the boat are bch bagholders and people dumb enough to listen to them.

Ok. He is stupid for thinking a 26M$ centralized system has anything to do with bitcoin security. You are stupid for thinking bitcoin adoption will match hardware improvements. Both dumb ideas lead to a dead bitcoin.

By your logic Craig Wright and Donald Trump are de-facto geniuses. Look at his words. He is wrong.

Tor is exposed as a local socks proxy that only allows connections from localhost. Its normal and secure.

Transactions are the only record in the ledger that can be used to demonstrate balances because they are signed with private keys of the balance holders. The blocks you describe would have no cryptographic integrity, just be a list of numbers. Consensus is very hard to do in a way thay can't be attacked. This type of optimization would open up attacks where consensus could be gamed cheaply to change accepted balances on the ledger.

id rather use bitcoin off chain via third party for small transactions than deal with intra-crypto price volatility or messing with exchanges and tax liabilities. at least until lightning is mature.

Core is a github repo, not an organization. The only language that the project speaks is code contributions and BIPs. Not meetings. Look at the IETF and the RFC process. This is how the Internet was developed. Business leaders meeting to make nuanced technical decisions doesnt make any sense.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:29:00
on-chain or p2p transactions may or may not scale to a global level. it seems promising with lightning, but not certain. I sent a friend $1 of btc yesterday between our coinbase wallets instantly with no fees. The bitcoin community is ideologically opposed to using third parties like this, but i suspect its most likely scenario. i dont see a functional difference between having a few hundred $ sitting in a third party wallet like coinbase or locked into a time-limited lightning channel contract. the coinbase like transactions come with third party risk and surveilance, but i think as btc becomes mainstream most of us wont care for daily use or migrate to third parties that we trust which ensure privacy. the sky isnt falling if i pay for coffee using btc with a coinbase or square app. btc holders will always have access to hodling offline and anonymous on chain transactions if we need them as long as we keep the core protocols pure and sensible. this middle ground scenario works now and is effecient until the other 2nd and 3rd layer solutions work well enough to see mainstream use.

It's not magic. They print money to pay it off. Dollars are a nearly meaningless abstraction in the context of national "debt". Politicians can't even pretend national debt is an actual crisis anymore because it's been played out so much.

Bcash supporters currently consist of salts (people who have ostracized themselves from the development and scientific community and have personal grudges like Gavin, and Jeff) and flat earthers (misinformed idiots and conspiracy theorists like Falkvinge, Wright, and most of r/btc). In my opinion, he happens to be exceptional in being both a salt and a flat earther while being well funded with a big mouth. A special kind of special.

Segwit transactions segregate the crypto chain important parts (witness data) of a transaction from the information parts. "Segregated Witness" The 1mb block size limit is applied to the witness data to be legacy compatible (this compatibility is what made for fork "soft"), but the other data can go over the limit and later be deleted if desired while still maintaining chain integrity. To compare segwit transactions with legacy transactions people talk in "weights" rather than size on disk. He was saying that deploying the segwit change is functionally the same as naively increasing block size to 4mb. Except the naive increase would be 4x less effecient and wouldnt fix tx malleability bug (which was cause of gox hack and necessary to be fixed for LN to work). 
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:19:49
Economic sanctions do kill babies. Crypto transactions help bypass sanctions. Both segwit and LN keep Bitcoin scalable, affordable, and most importantly censorship resistant. Without censorship resistance as feature priority  the affordability is meaningless because nation states will enforce sanctions via legal attacks or technical countermeasures. So no. Its likely the opposite. Rogers claim is that block size limits increase tx cost and makes crypto out of the reach of poor people in sanctioned countries. My observation and the sentiment of many others is that small blocks prevent censorship because they are more widely and quickly propagated and validated. Much harder to stop. Regardless of current short sighted arguments, both approaches will likely make it harder for nation states to kill babies in the future, so thats cool. All good.

The whole purpose and creation of btc is that nobody can stop you from giving it to another person. No third party is required no bank, no gov, nobody. This is why its a big deal. It has immense value because it is the only provably scarce thing in the known universe which makes it perfect for storing wealth.

It's good advice. Debt is resolved by printing money which devalues it via inflation. Buying any non-fiat asset is good advice, metals, real estate, bitcoin, stocks. They all maintain value. Bitcoin is a global asset unlike the others who all depend on gov to enforce ownership via laws and regulation (unless you hold your own metals but those are easily stolen/confiscated). In a debt crisis, people with cash in their bank accounts or under their mattress are the ones who get hurt the most.
