Hello there from Europe .
First off all i would like to say that you're a loving and generous guy/girl.
I'm a graduate from Antwerp but the only thing that keeps struggling in my mind is the step to finally be able to live by myself and be responsable for all my actions taken. Since i will not be able to buy off the first 3 or 4 months of rent i would it appreciate more than anything if your support could help me out so that i will be able to help not only myself but my mother who is struggling with her hernia and needs to take a medical dose of CBD oil wich is very expensive where we live. 
I want to thank you again for giving so many chances to people who will deserve it more then some others.
I can Pm yo my adress because i don't know how to verify it correctly.
Have a Merry Christmas friend.

All bullshit , Bitcoin is a plan by the elite they have been planning this since the 80's

Is that why it says "2018" in the picture ?
Do you people need any more truth in plain sight ?

Support for Belgium would be awesome....
Anyone knows if they are expanding ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:04:44
Not that i'm excited to cash out a few euros , and no i'm not starving fyi
The only thing that bothers me is the minimum amouny you have pay in order to buy bitcoin.
I mean you could do orders from 5 to 10 , 20 and so on but now it's 500 ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:57:17
Blockchain says i need to have atleast 48.62€ not including fees so...
Should i wait for it to go up till i cash out?

@_date: 2017-08-21 19:08:15
Can't seem to find any trace of it , so is it possible to format windows 10 without losing data or ?
And why don't use windows , been using it forever and had no problem until now?
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:09:54
Thanks for the response
If i will use the reset this pc option and keep my data pics does it matter where my files are being located atm ? Like i got FL studio files and plugins etc.
