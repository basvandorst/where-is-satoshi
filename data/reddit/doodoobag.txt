GPU mining is obsolete? Since when?
I've yet to get into the mining loop, but it looks like it could be a lot of fun.
EDIT: My google-fu told me that ASIC's are the new way to do it.

I feel like if you used the price that McDonald's needs in order to manufacture a hamburger, you could probably do it right now.

Do you think the same was not said about bitcoin before the MtGox hack? Or the Titanic before it sank?
I understand that we have more insight into the longevity and stability of it (because we can see the source code, and the rules that it has to follow), but I still feel like having a bit of skepticism can be a good thing. I've got 600USD tied up in bitcoins right now, but still don't feel comfortable with saying something like "I can easily just not loom over the prices. I'll make money in my sleep!". I feel like it's not entirely "antifragile", but feel that it's stable enough for me to invest in it.

If things start getting wobbly, though, do you think that the large investors right now would back out while they can, because of the uncertainty of the market?
Also, do you think ASICs will have any influence? I know they're slowly being released out, but I remember everyone being extremely worried when the first ones were unveiled. Now that they're starting to roll out off the lines, do you think it'll influence the price/stability of the market?

I'm glad to see we're finally gaining some ground!
Long live bitcoin.

I understand. Some people (including me), just can't lost the skepticism. I love the idea of bitcoins, and love using them.. I just think that they're going to pop because not enough people devote enough trust in them, and many seem likely to back out after purchasing.
