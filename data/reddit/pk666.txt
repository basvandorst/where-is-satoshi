I think the entire future of work is up for grabs. Who knows what automation, renewable fuels, medicine and even bitcoin, are gonna change. My husband and I both have employment and hobbies which did not exist when we were kids and I think a universal basic income is up for the mix, but who is to say. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:51:42
Indeed. Everyone needs to watch [Nebraksa]( right now

Money can't buy more kids (trust me, I did IVF). Money can't buy non-crazy family and genuine friends nor good health and this is the essential what, who and how I fantasise sharing my bitcoin wealth with - the parties, the travel, the visits, the giving, the long life and good times. But I am still very blessed and cannot wait. Fingers crossed.
Edit - I suppose it's an over 40 thing.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:17:20
Don’t have kids then, no one is forcing you to. I’m from a big rambling family and love my siblings in their random variations, to each their own.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:06:02
I was thinking of this scene last night.  Bravo. 
2 other things: 
1) Does this make Ver Slugworth? (Except for the end when he’s actually a Wonka agent) 
2) there is a running joke in my family when you trf btc and waiting for confirmation is like watching Mike TV flying across the room in a million tiny pieces and just waiting for him to reappear....

I call her reaction 'Schindlering'. At the risk of offending a lot of people - you basically become like Liam Neeson at the end of Schindler's List when it starts to hit ATHs -  "I threw away so much money.

Might be nice to see the adoption of women’s rights at the same time.
Now where is that smart person to start an exchange /payment app/whatever especially for the Global poor? Forget dowries, it would be far more revolutionary see maids in Saudi and single mothers in the favelas getting into bitcoin before Wall Street.

@_date: 2017-11-08 20:33:37
Check your bank statements for payment into the exchange maybe? At least that might give you a date.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:19:50
good argument you got there...
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:11:38
More men are in STEM arenas, so perhaps you need to do what many sensible people have been suggesting for years namely - 
**Embolden younger girls with STEM interests and encourage them in associated careers** = more women into bitcoin = more women you have something in common with and the pool of possible life partners opens up = household budgets operate in bitcoin= bitcoin globally has a higher adoption rate.
Encouraging women in this sphere is good for everyone and works far better than lame and/or sexist memes.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:02:20
Oh no I think its pretty accurate in it's assesment of the culture (well the online culture perhaps) and it echoes my thoughts about putting bitcoin into the hands of women, specifically impoverished women, to make it fully democratic and see it taken up by whole sectors which will improve it for everyone, and that requires insight into the needs of women within their societal standing (eg getting permission to do stuff) and how they developers need to understand this or they'll never quite get there.
I don't believe bitcoin is doomed - thats just getting hysterical, or that women only want to deal with 'social' transactions and not the blockchain stuff - thats just a cop out and more sexist than most of the comments here.
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:36:10
Fair enough. Though I don’t think one real estate agency in the country (making news for it 3 years ago - with no others popping up since) makes it an everyday phenomenon.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:44:10
I am hoping for a bitcoin future filled with forward thinking millionaires who subvert the traditional character of plutocratic douchebags now running the show - sadly this thread isn't really giving me much confidence.
edit - the gags about the meme people dying their hair/runnig from the taxman are pretty funny tho
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:42:56
Tbh I’d kinda forgotten about it - it’s not worth that much and only minimal pay out  if I did kick the bucket. Let’s enjoy ride when we are alive I say.

I'm talking interests and inclinations for maths and science, not sexual orientation here.
For the record I have fraternal twin girls once who wants to be a fairy when she grows up, and one who wants to be a scientist (something neither of her parents are) I know for a fact in just one generation back and in many places even in western society these days that kind of interest would not be fostered. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:12:08
Me too, and he's still only mildly into it. Especially as we couldn't afford to dig into our usual budget to buy,  so I cashed in a pissweak life insurance policy I've had since I was born (which counted as 'my money') and put the lot on BTC. Everybody happy now!
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:51:32


haha! My fav term 'cockforest' has now been usurped!
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:32:55
Me. And just woke to this message from my sister (it’s 6am here) 
“I watched carvalho v ver !  i was spewing it deteriorated into ver going berserk!  i wanted to hear more.    i wanted carvalho to ask ver why not just use lite coin instead of bcash ? also wanted to hear ver questioned re exponential network scaling.    Ver did himself no favours - but his initial point on btc not being peer to peer transaction was interesting.”
Does my anecdata get me 10 bitcoins now? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:08:47


but perhaps some of it is also nurture and social conditioning, considering girls in STEM were up to recently, not encouraged or mentored as young boys were in the sciences. They were prepped to be wives, mothers and home makers foremost - even up till the 70s in some industries women had to quit after they got married.......why bother studying if you just have to give it all up?
I guess time will tell now that that is changing.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:26:35
Biology has not much to do with it. 
Conditioning and expectation pure and simple.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:34:09
I personally want to share everything with my partner - from child raising, life choices on where and how to live and (especially as we are not made of nor come from vast reserves of cash) pooling funds. If you want to keep secrets from your partner go for it but I really wonder why. To what end? It is most certainly a trust issue.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:35:38


not when you've never been allowed you own bank account it's not! ; )
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:07:36
Have you bought a place recently in Australia via an agent? the rules have way tightened. Can you show me a bitcoin payment option on a real estate agent’s listing for example? Because I kinda think you’re talking shit. (Although I am sure the Chinese export their cash in a myriad of ways - I just don’t think btc is a big one just yet and certainly not where real estate is involved.....
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:10:56
I thought it was about the fact that the developers were prioritising the making of as much money as possible over everything else (and not a useability/functionality thing as such)- because coming form a white male, first world developer perspective  "that's what everyone wants right?" when in other cultures and especially as a woman in those cultures - just having something you control, that is 'yours' and not something allowed to you which can be revoked at any moment, is a more pressing want, than generating wealth. (which it should also do). A developer in silicon valley is gonna have a hard time understanding life as a middle-aged, illiterate woman in her 40s with 4 kids to support and hence her tech needs. The more everyone is involved in their own tech/bitcoin the better.

oh ffs.
Men are heroes and women are all prostitutes.
Good luck finding a regular, intelligent woman who'll respect you and your gender affirming delusions of grandeur. You'll no doubt do the douchebag thing if (and only if) you strike it rich:  find that basic goldigger who puts up with such ideological drivel, who'll eventually try to extract some cash from you when the viagra stops working and then your confirmation bias will be complete. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:32:53
We are talking about scientific thought. Maths, cognitive ability.
Tell me how managing endless kids, livestock, crops, weather variables, food rationing etc etc etc.... makes for a lesser brain in maths and science today again? 
Nah actually don't - i'm not getting into this 4chan \ path of defending the interests of women in science and maths as some kind of gender defying freak show.

I have been talking about doing this on other threads - a "finance sans frontiers" type org dedicated to getting filipino maids, single mothers in faveals and remote farming women in Africa into bitcoin - that is what will make it democratic and affect change - controlling your own money is empowerment (in other words -bitcoin in a nutshell) even a tiny amount.

Um, I'm Australian.
I used the term 'Liberal' for clarity for the majority Americans here,  (FYI the  'liberals' in my country are the conservatives) but really I'm what we deem a left wing progressive greens voter. I wouldn't call myself a libertarian. The only country club I've ever seen is on Caddy Shack. But you're right, private clubs are bullshit.
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:04:03
Yep, totally agree - got into a frenzy last year about starting an org specifically focused on getting the poorest of the world into bitcoin. Setting up similar spirit to micro-lending and goatbanks but using crypto as the currency.
