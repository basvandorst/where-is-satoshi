Movies can still be viruses. Only click .mp4!!
Watch out for windows shortcut .lnk files. They can have obfuscated command shell lines which rebuild code and execute it. The movie file is basically the virus code and it can also download more files.

I think they're being named 'movie.mp4.lnk' and are 700mb+ in size, so fairly convincing to many users.
I imagine someone who just clicks on the 'movie' will think nothing is wrong, but it runs a powershell command and yes, wasted GB of download time.
**I run explorer in detail view and extension visibility on. I dont think there would be a preview or the correct icon. It's possible that there are two files working together to make one big virus, the lnk file does the work, the large file would contain the data.

Coinbase is virtually safe. What's not safe is someone accessing the account. This can happen many ways. Send it to an address created by a hardware wallet and backup all seed words, addresses and private keys. You are your own bank and also the security guard.

People who didnt rely on banks or heavily invested in stocks really didnt even notice the great depression. They had farms, they milked cows and ate chicken eggs.
