Does the IRS have jurisdiction in Korea?

I am currently in the EU, and I had my bank account suspend as well with a two months notice. I think technically this is illegal as access to a "bank account with basic features" is considered a fundamental right in the EU. I wish I had the time and energy to sue.

Actually most video and voice over the internet is transferred via UDP not TCP. They both run on top of the IP protocol.

On average, this is roughly equivalent to an inflation rate of around 1% per year. The US dollar is losing value at least twice as fast.

You should be clear that your statement is merely an opinion, and not formal guidelines by the IRS. While it is true that forks do generate income, and they should be taxed, it is an open question as to how exactly.  The consensus seems to be that they should be treated as capital gains income, but there are unanswered questions:
1) What is the cost basis? Is it supposed to be zero as they were forked from an underlying asset without any additional investment by the holder, or should their cost be a fraction of the original cost that was paid for the underlying asset as they derive their value from it.
2) What is the acquisition date? This is simlar to the above question. Is the acquisition date the date of the fork, or the date when the original coins were purchased? This is important for whether coins are to be taxed at the long term rate, or the short term rate. 
3) Which is the main coin, and which is the fork? In the even of a blockchain fork, where both coins claim to be the legitimate one, and accuse the other of being fake, then which coin should be trated as the fork? Is the IRS then to become an arbiter of which coin is legitimate and which is not? Forks are symmetric, and the tax laws should respect this symmetry. Your taxes cannot depend on arbitrary claims of legitimacy by one party vs another. 
EDIT: My opinion on the answers to the above questions is:
1) To compute the cost basis first compute the fraction that the coin constitutes of the total market cap of all forks at the date of sale  from the original coin that can be traced to the orginal purchase. Then use that fraction of the original payment as your cost basis for the new coin. Note that this reduces the cost basis that you use for other coins that can be traced to that purchase.
 
2) The acquistion date should remain the date of the acqustion of the original coin, not the date of the fork as no money is paid on that date. 
3) This treatment respects the symmetry in forks. You do not have to worry about which coin is the main one and which coin is the fork.

I hope you do too.

Remember that in countries like Turkey the authority on Islam (the Diyanet) is  the ministry of religious affairs, which is a branch of the government, so it has a vested interested in defending the legal tender issued by the government against competition like bitcoin. I doubt that there is any theological justification for their statements.

No, it is not. Especially if both claim to be the true coin. Then it really becomes a political question, which I am sure the IRS would prefer not to get involved in. If they want to remain above politics, they need to treat each branch after the fork point equally. Your suggested tax treatment does not do that.
