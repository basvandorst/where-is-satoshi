So am I to gather from this that theoretically there are function types that might or might not exist which are in charge of protecting this kind of attack &gt;&gt; and if at best case scenario they do, it would only be true it would render the process [hard]( **not impossible**?
You are saying "everybody thinks they do" is supposed to be a good enough reason for me to believe in a new system to hold my money?
But uhm if it turns out everybody was wrong (happens more frequently throughout our history than most are willing to acknowledge mind you) then poof goes my hard earned money?

So that circles back to my latest question. What are the upwards-compatible cryptographical capabilities of bitcoin? Can ECDSA be replaced with a better algorithm in the future without risking the entire system's collapse should it be needed?

You realize that you just threw at me another "everybody thinks they do" right?
I don't care who uses it, and what it is considered.
I'm talking about the fine math which is the foundation of this system. I'm not simply asking if the system is potentially vulnerable. I am asking if the system is potentially vulnerable if at the very least the public key of someone else's wallet is obtained.

Maybe it is for me, maybe it is not. But you are incorrect. Everyone relies on the latest cryptography until a better solution arrives. Most quickly when a solution has been proven vulnerable.
The whole world might rely on today's modern cryptography, but what guarantee is there that the pattern of once-great solutions found to have vulnerabilities will not continue to become obsolete and replaced with the next best 'practically impossible' solution.

Today that might be the case. But tomorrow (or in 10 years from today) someone can come up with a new function specifically made to weaken (to any degree) or absolutely counter bitcoin's supposed one-way function/discrete logarithm. Then what?
Banks, for example, have the option of always upgrading their security system. Bitcoin's will always stay in place and eventually become overshadowed by technologies X times better than today both in terms of security and in terms of countering said security. 
In other words, what is modern today will be old tomorrow. And no, other financial institutions will not crash because they will always continue to try to upgrade their security systems long before the evolution of threats evolves to a point of sufficient credibility.
But bitcoin has a hardcoded foundation. What then for my money?

I have a hard time multiplying numbers, so when I saw that mathematician's ponytail, ya, I was out.
There is still a real problem, awesome algorithm included. Can you upgrade the algorithm at will?

But the bitcoin software created the public/private key pair. How can I not feed that same public key back into the bitcoin software in order to produce the private key. It's all in the math; I mean the equation for producing the pair offline is already in there, how is it not possible to use (or find a new) mathematical equation to use in reverse?
Example scenario:
Someone gives/posts their public address online OR in 10 years hashes for public addresses are found to be convertible. How can this be not used with the original software (math) to reproduce the matching private key?
@_date: 2014-03-26 08:03:52
Close but not entirely true. Brute forcing implies 1 key being searched against many other keys whereas creating wallets implies basically creating a new pair time and time again.

Not sure if I should honor this with a reply or not. But I'll cut you this deal. Prove that the bitcoin network could update, should it ever be necessary, its foundational cryptographic functions and I shut up.
@_date: 2014-03-26 07:45:32
Key word: Today's.
And yes time and time again cryptography is updated and replaced with newer cryptotechnologies most times because of the weaker status of their predecessors.
To directly answer you though: I think today's cryptography will be rendered obsolete one day. I assume far less than 100 years, but still no less, a yes.
@_date: 2014-03-26 07:38:19
This. 100 times.
Quote this as a proven possibility and you win.
I don't mind if it's from the bitcoin whitepaper directly or your own math showing how the bitcoin foundational function can be upgraded in a 100% secure manner as not to risk anyone including the system itself during it's upgrade.
@_date: 2014-03-26 07:41:16


You are talking in terms of today. Can you predict that this will be precisely true in 10 or 100 years? Please keep in mind human history of last 30 years, at least. 
And then what if it turns out not-to-be-so-quite-precisely-true?
@_date: 2014-03-26 08:13:21


Could you provide proof of this?
If it is pure speculation you realize the long-term viability of this coin is anchored with a ticking clock right?


Wrong. I am questioning bitcoin's ability to, as you say, swap algorithms in and out with upgrades.


Never said no nor meant to imply that it wasn't.
But the issue about upgrading foundational functions of the bitcoin network is still really serious. I hope you have some insight in this regard.

And people don't win Fields Medals?
This is the nature of people. They evolve, become much smarter than their predecessors, and in today's rate with significant motive I can't see how this would hold decades no less a century. Bro, we've got cars on mars already. I've seen a lot of 'practically impossible' become damn possible in my times. I need something more than it would take a super-genius or super duper unrealized technology to pose a threat to the bitcoin system.
