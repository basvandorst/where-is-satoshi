Check BTC-e, I do believe they have a few such features.
Just keep in mind that sometimes sites refuse to honour these kinds of triggers (or stop-orders) because of server load being too great during times of massive market movements.
It'd be a good idea to read up on about which BTC exchanges support this functionality and are reliable with it.

Here's a general rule-set he probably follows.
1. If the price is falling, MUST PROTECT YOUR INVESTMENT, SELL, SELL.
2. If the price is rising, I'M GOING TO MISS OUT, BUY BUY.
Now lets work out the inverse rule-set
1. The price is falling, BUY CHEAP BITCOINS.
2. The price is rising, people are being silly, going to sell now.
The first ruleset applies to a long-term investor who wants to see growth, the later applies to a short-term investor who wants to make fast realised gains.
TL;DR If you want to see your Bitcoins reach a bazillion dollars, you don't have the right mindset to do day trading.

You are talking about triggers, as far as I know Bitstamp do not offer that functionality.
IF you set a limit order for less than the market price it will execute immediately and for as much volume as it can seize at the best possible price.
That is to say, if you set a limit order for $205, you will be selling however many BTC you sell for the current market price.
ALSO it's not generally a good thing to automate a sale in the event of a price drop, as you are guaranteeing a loss of capital.
If you are only concerned about short-term gains, you should consider setting a limit sell order for the next $15 price climb etc.

Maybe PayPal are looking to support Bitcoin as a product.
They could easily provide escrow and arbitration of Bitcoin sales. (I.e. use PayPay to buy Bitcoin, and seller nor buyer can scam each other.)
Suddenly it becomes incredibly easy for people to acquire Bitcoin, and PayPal gets a huge chunk of fees involved.
They could also buy up any amount of Bitcoin by offering a cash-out service, or treating it as a currency type.

The average consumer need not deal with exchanges, as they should be able to walk into 7/11 and buy a pre-paid Bitcoin card, the BTC value will be fixed, and the cost would be calculated at the time of exchange.

They will refund anyone who has access to the invoice window unfortunately, so be careful with sharing the invoice url or accessing it on a public window.
There's no need to 'prove' you sent it.
Both the CD key site and BitPay will be able to find the partially paid or outdated invoice and they will refund to an address of your choosing.
I just wish the whole process was automated and it would return coins to the origin address or an address of your choosing if you intercept some expiry delay.

Never keep more than a third of your assets in any form.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:58:11


It's not foolproof unless you have unlimited funds, it's likely to work though.
The real issue is that you're trying to triple M to get 3M, but you need to have M x 3^y on hand, where y is the number of attempts you need to make to win (based on chance).
Your chance of winning each time is 1 in 3 (in this case) so 33%, and your chance of losing is 66%.
Your chance of losing is reduced by 33% each time you bet, so it goes something like: (Rounded figures)
66% -&gt; 44% -&gt; 30% -&gt; 20% -&gt; 13% -&gt; 8%
That is to say if you have enough money to back 6 bets, you still have an 8% chance of losing out entirely. (You also lose all your money, not just the original bet.)
In his case, 0.66^11 is ~0.01 or 1%.
His bet was effectively laying down 300 BTC at a 99% chance of winning 0.1677 BTC.
Silly huh?

That's a service agreement, you agree to the terms of a service and in exchange they hold your bitcoins for you for the purpose of trading them on their exchange.
You still own them, but they could disappear one day, and then you probably wouldn't own them.
Unless the exchange you're using resides in the country (and you understand the laws involved where) you live, you will  have a hard time getting your BTC back if something like that happens.
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:56:53
Your bitcoins are as secure as your system, if someone can read the wallet, then you've lost the bitcoins.
So consider any malware, or potential attacks that involve your wallet being published or read by a third party.
It however is not published to the web, which means you are more likely to lose it when your HDD fails (unless you print out some private keys) and it is significantly safer than an cloud stored wallet.
You should however encrypt your local wallets.
For true security, print out a paper wallet, generated from an offline computer and only type/scan the private key in when you actually need to spend the money, and do so IMMEDIATELY. (Have multiple of these, so you can cascade the change into un-tainted paper wallets.)

SHA-256 is a (secure) hashing function not a encryption standard or protocol.
The 'Secure' in its name refers to the very low (no known attacks) probability of hash collision, an issue that presents a very serious flaw in other algorithms such as MD5.
Bitcoin uses public key cryptography to determine/enforce authority/ownership.

The only way to make money is to not be worried about losing your initial investment.

That's very true, but the difference is that people assume the wallet to be unknown to everybody, including themselves until the hologram is destroyed.
If I put 1,000 BTC on BTC-e I would be quite concerned about how long I left it there, where as I'd expect a paper wallet to hold the value securely as long as I kept the wallet secure. :)
I do agree with you though, they look freaking awesome!

Don't use an exchange as a payment wallet ever, they tend to not use fees and thus can result in very slow confirmations (yet they have priority because they move large volumes I believe).
It's especially hazardous with BitPay, as there is an expiry on the invoice (to avoid fluctuating markets) and it is likely to not make it by the time it gets there.
I had a similar issue where I moved my coin to a temporary blockchain wallet from my exchange then I was using the send tool to calculate the mining fee and it indadvertedly sent my BTC to a old invoice.

I'm just curious, what software were you using?
I'm surprised most clients don't raise a flag when the fee exceeds the combined outputs.
Something along the lines of: "You are sending X BTC, with a mining fee of X BTC. Are you sure you want to include this large fee?"
So if you're sending 100 BTC, a 1 BTC fee is reasonable, where as a 1000 BTC fee should raise some flags.

However Bitcoin is a form of currency, so in reality it's just an exchange.
You're exchanging BTC for your local currency.

Can't say if you should, but send it to Bitstamp and sell if it you really want to.

Long-term maybe/no, definitely not going to out-perform Bitcoin.
Short-term yes/maybe, there are gains to realise if that's your thing. (Due to market speculation and misconceptions about alt-coins.)

You're actually correct.

If you generate an offline wallet you need to ENSURE you do it properly, because if you don't you won't be able to do anything with the BTC you eventually buy.
So try this with 0.001 Bitcoins first (roughly $1 USD atm).
Download this: 
Move it to a offline machine with access to a printer, then open it in a browser. (OFFLINE!)
Click through to the generate tab and click private exponent (don't be tempted to use a pass phrase).
Now you can either click random, or type in some random hex (make sure it's random, or generate it somewhere else).
You need to save/print the address and the private key on this page.
Make sure you print multiple copies, and then drop the offline computer and your printer in lava.
Now do this twice, first time to test it works, and actually spend the 1 mBTC you are testing with.
Then once again with 10 BTC. :D

I'm down at least 5 times.
So right.

It would be pretty simple to set up a tablet to have the donations show up live for street performers.
Obviously not the case for beggars.
Also what's wrong with a 50 cent donation. :\

You should always talk in percentages for this very reason.
If a stock goes from $300 USD to 30 cents, that's a 99.9% price drop.
If it goes from $1200 USD to $900 USD, that's a 25% price drop.
If it goes from 30 cents to 0.03 cents, that's a 99.9% price drop.
If it goes from $1.20 to 90 cents, that's a 25% price drop.
Now see if you can contrast these events as similar without looking at or considering the percentages.

When you walk into a grocery store in 2020 and you go to buy things with Bitcoin on your integrated Bitcoin device:
Do you want to see prices in all magnitudes of scale?
15 m฿ for this cake, 12 µ฿ for this gum, 10 ฿ for this car.
If that's cool then fair enough, but I find it hard to compare those values immediately.
