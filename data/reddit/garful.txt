I'm confused on where you feel I suggested deflation a good thing.  Volatility of currency, in either direction, is not good.  I know that Bitcoin is ridiculously volatile, but it's a fledgling technology and not yet being utilized as a currency.  However, it has the potential to provide a stable store of value largely because it's nature makes it difficult to manipulate and it has a truly limited quantity.

"If you want to save money over decades then you should use money to buy something that retains its value over decades (or better yet, and invest it into something that produces wealth instead of just hoarding wealth)."
You just explained the OPs point and why people back the idea of Bitcoin, and why people have been shoving their money into gold...
We deserve a currency that will retain it's value. You should not have to invest your money and risk it in order to retire one day, rather than saving it up on your own. I shouldn't have to start an IRA because I need something more reliable in value that the current global currency...

What you're explaining is how our current system works and treats money. How it manipulates behavior to turn us into consumers and promote spending. I don't feel that currency manipulation is appropriate in any form, whether it's China devaluing their currency to promote exports or a constant and steady inflation rate to promote consumerism.
In the American economy, I don't feel segments of the population need any incentive to spend more (keep spending).  In fact, most Americans are spending well beyond their means and loan/debt problems are massive is lower and middle class America.


So it can be used as a reliable store of value. American's will not stop spending if the dollar stabilizes. Allow marketing and advertisers to entice people to spend their money, not currency manipulators.

I didn't miss his point at all. Global currency should not be controlled by a third party bent on determining how they want me to behave, or the people in general. The distribution of wealth in America is a very dangerous place.  The current system has failed the general population of the American people.  The system is constantly gamed and manipulated to the benefits of those that have the power to manipulate it.  The best solution: decentralized currency that cannot be easily manipulated.
It won't fix all the problems, but it's a good start.
Government failed at providing us a safe and reliable currency, so, thankfully, we're going to provide it for ourselves.

I'm just going to ignore the sarcasm and pretend you're agreeing with me!

Does 10 years of meaningful gains factor in there anywhere?

You're absolutely right.  It just frustrates me because I know there are innovators out there doing awesome things that I'd like to read about, but finding the information is quite a search.

I know.  It's why at the end of the post, I realized I was just venting.  Nothing's going to change, but man does it get frustrating sometimes.

It really depends on the miners. If enough of the network moves over to Bitcoin cash, it's possible, but I don't think a change in dominance is happening any time soon.  The nice thing about a fork, if you already owned bitcoin before the BCC fork, is that you don't have to make a choice.  Just HODL on both and let things work themselves out.  Yes, if you guess right now you would end up better, but I prefer not to guess myself.  Even in the current Wild West that is Crypto, diversifying is still a sound basic strategy.
