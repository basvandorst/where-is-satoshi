Really?? Did you just really compare market gains that are happening because everyone is buying, with a "steady state" situation, i.e. a situation once prices will have stabilized? Really??? Please tell me that's not the case, that you were trolling.. because otherwise you clearly lack the understanding to discuss this.
Also, a 1% per year is basically interest on the money... a 1% per year. Also... how does this 1% per year square off with a deflationary coin? Or will we increase the coin supply by 1% every year, so make it inflationary?




God damn, you are just proving with your writing that you have no idea... Who cares about the profit margins now that the price is growing??? The question is about the sustainability of a PoS vs PoW economy. And just what "real work" do stakeholders do? Sit on their giant pile of cash, spending less than the interest is given them, thus accumulating more and more? Hmmm.... sounds like something I've seen before. Oh, yeah... the 0.1% today!!!


Regardless of economic activity... that's what you need to get. Some people *naturally* spend less than others. Which will lead them to slowly increase their stake just by hoarding. And if you include natural economic activity, where as the real world demonstrates, wealth accumulation already happens, it's all even worse.
 &amp;nbsp;
Please stop talking nonsense and re-think the whole Proof-of-Shit consensus again. Read about it, and understand that PoS is basically interest on money. Which encourages hoarding and only reinforces whatever wealth imbalances are creating by normal economic activity.

There is no "sending Bitcoin from one country to another"... what you can do is "send Bitcoin from one address to another". Bitcoin sees no "human erected borders", so if one address is owned by a dude that holds a Canadian passport and the other address is owned by another dude that owns a South Korean passport, Bitcoin doesn't care.
Withdraw coins from the exchange, and give them your buddy's address. (Make sure it's a SegWit address!!!... should start with a '3', not a '1'). It'll all be OK.

Inaccurate comparison. On Netflix the connection is P2P, or better Netflix-to-Peer. So you can stream exactly what you want, and it doesn't affect me. However, if someone was able to stream a shitshow for EVERYONE to watch first, and only then I could watch whatever I wanted, then it would be spamming, even if they paid for it.
BTC txs are broadcast one-to-all, Netflix streaming is not. One tx affects everyone.

Because it was done as a backdoor attempt... Miners were blocking SegWit because of profit reasons (SW prevents ASIC boost), and then a bunch of businesses agreed we were gonna have both. But not by engaging with Core, simply saying that was gonna be the case, period. And effectively replacing the main client, Core, with the clusterfuck S2X client which came to a stand still before actually forking. 
And if you check his tweets, Adam Back suggested working together for a 2MB block increase after SegWit activated. That was shut down... because it was never about the size of the frigging blocks, but about control over the protocol.

Don't buy into the "urgency" narrative... it really isn't there. Believe me when I say that I'd love to get all my stuff with cryptos, but people in r-bitcoin, and other crypto subs for that matter, a small minority of enthusiasts.
How many grannies have you seen yell at the corner store manager for the Bitcoin high fees? How many conversations between randoms on the street saying "Fuck bitcoin, I've had to change it to *favourite altcoin* because the fees are killing it". How many Businesses are saying "We are *shutting down* because Bitcoin doesn't scale and fees are too high."?
It's a rhetorical question... The reason for that is that the world is only waking up to cryptos. It's woke up with a slap in the face, yes, but it's only waking up. Meanwhile, exceptional coders are at work doing what they love most, and in a sensible way. And until the world is ready to embrace cryptos fully, say 2-5 years, keep using what you always did - plastic or fiat.
Rome wasn't built in a day, and the old financial system won't be replaced by big blocks.

I disagree with this. If you go into a bathroom, shit all over the place and some of it goes into the toilet as well, you cannot blame the toilet for not being well designed. In a similar spirit, if 27 people shit in said toilet without flushing, you can't blame the toilet system for overflowing.
The technology is sound and robust, as demonstrated by the 100% up-time. It's the user experience that is currently under stress, and that can happen with any technology if used inappropriately.
This is an attack on Bitcoin - CB refusing to activate SegWit, yet they were a vocal proponent of S2X, which included SegWit!!! Unfortunately Bitcoin is victim of it's own success, and now has to go through growing pains of giant players thinking they can do whatever they want. Reminds one of the early days of the Internet, when companies were trying to "control the Internet".
It might take some time, but if CB doesn't get their act straight and play fair, the market will punish them. Only problem, that twat of a CEO is already rich... he should lose everything in the process as well.

It takes more space, but the second part of the claim is correct, more SegWit txs will result in lower fees for others as well. Also, SegWit txs do have a lower weight than normal txs, so lower fees.

@_date: 2018-01-12 18:51:05


Of course you can use batching... that's got nothing to do with SegWit. Instead of processing every single txs on a one-to-one basis, you simply process many txs into one. For instance, one input (with very many coins) + 1 signature to 100 outputs instead of 100 inputs + 100 signatures to 100 outputs. 
And CB is not paying the fees... GDAX does. So if you move coins FROM CB, the customer pays the fee.

What a ridiculous argument. Perhaps more importantly... let's admit it is a bubble. So what? 
Amazon, in 2000, was in a bubble together with all the other dot com stocks. 
What I fail to see in these "it's a bubble" arguments is what are the consequences of this. For one, Bitcoin crashed ~40% so many times I lost count. If the stock market crashed that much, we'd be talking about it for the next 300 years. So maybe that bubble popped very many times. But even so... all you "it's a bubble"-ists, what is the real claim? That it will go to 0? That it will correct 90% and then shoot a lot further up? What are you really trying to say by claiming that it's a bubble?

PoS = Proof-of-Shit
PoS is a broken consensus mechanism from a fundamental, game theoretical point of view - It encourages hoarding WELL BEYOND the hodling people do with Bitcoin. Which means the rich get richer, and it's inevitable. With PoW, you need to do actual work to get more coins, unlike PoS where all you need to do is... have coins.
Start with the most benign initial distribution, a uniform distribution of coins. PoS will inevitably lead to all the wealth concentrated in the hands of few players just by coin distribution. With PoW this doesn't happen.

The LN will work a bit like the old pre-paid/top-up phone cards. Pay as you go. The wallets will take care of all the underlying - open/close a channel, route payments and such. Then you'll just tell your mom/average Joe:
*"Just top up your Starbucks, and then you can use it with super low fees until you run out of credit. Then you can top it up again and again and again.*"
Or you'll tell them to top up their account for groceries, or the account for nights out, or the account for the nail salon... You get the point. And if there will be any larger, well connected LN nodes, they can simply top up once a month with the total expected expenditures.
No need to tell them about "channels" or anything technical, just say "It's like using a prepaid gift card". They'll get it.
Oh, and stop treating Satoshi like a God, and his words like sacred. That's the kind of attitude they have over at r-btc. We have moved on, and recognise that the peer-to-peer cash problem is a bit more challenging than "Big blocks now!!!". And LN, together with other ideas, is part of the solution.

All blockchain coins have scaling issues. ALL. The only reason they can claim "Low fees!!!" is because they don't have scale. 
Now ask yourself which coins do have any remote chance of scaling, in the sense of having a well defined plan of scaling? The answer is very few, Bitcoin is one, ETH is another. But ETH is NOT a coin.. it's a platform for smart contracts. And then LTC and DCR... all of which are using the same tech developed for BTC, LN! So yeah... every other coin wishes it was in BTC's positions.

I think the answer might be yes, actually. Still trying to understand LN better, but what is preventing us to open a channel with zero funds in my end and a a non-zero sum on your end? I couldn't send any coins, but you could send me coins. This is how a merchant would operate, I would think: Customers will open channels with merchants, who would not need to put down any money. Else you'd never convince merchants to do it, or very few anyway.

The bank is declining the payment because it's flagged as suspicious. They see many txs to the same business in a short time, which is suspicious, and so they block them. 
Call your bank and tell them you are legit trying to buy ONCE, so they should unblock the card, and then try again.

And Fish Wars are coming... or something like that.
At first I was skeptical of ETH, but then realised it truly is visionary. Problem is, ETH has the exact same problem BTC has - Scaling. (Also, every other blockchain coin has the same problem, don't think otherwise.) But unlike BTC, ETH IS under pressure... people are building all sorts of shit on top of it. Vitalik was saying scaling will be achieved in 2-5yrs. I think that's way too long. Give it another Crypto Kittens, maybe Fish Wars?, or two, and ETH will collapse. The devs know it, and so does the community... which is not happy at all with the increased network loads. 
Btw... guess what happened to ETH txs fees under all this load? You have one guess, and can use Google. Second question: How much would those fees be if 1ETH = 1BTC in price? Hint: Proportionally higher.
Don't be tempted to believe the hype about altcoins being scalable and what not. Blockchain coins cannot scale, or rather it's a very open question on how to do it. Bitcoin is the only one with a realistic proposal.

Bandwidth... It's all about bandwidth. CPU power and storage have got very little to do with anything. It's bandwidth. 
Even with SegWit and 1MB blocks guys in AU have been reporting it's becoming challenging to run full nodes. And that's with an efficient network. On BCH, where txs are as wasteful as it gets, you'll have problems for much smaller tx volumes.

In my example it would be a 2-out-of-3 multisig address. You send the money to a multisig address that requires 2/3 parties to move them. Possible situations:
* You check the goods, all is OK, you and the seller sign the txs for seller to get the money.
* Something goes wrong... enter the escrow. Depending on who is cheating, you or the seller, the escrow will provide the second signature to move the funds and make them irreversible. So if the seller delivers crap, you document as you should to demonstrate that the goods were crap, and the escrow will sign the txs so you get the money back. If you cheat, and the seller can prove it, escrow signs the txs for the seller to get the money.
Basically it becomes irreversible after you've agreed everything is OK or after escrow judges in favour of either party. Escrow = judge/neutral third party.

Have a read and educate yourself [here](


What you contend and your opinion on what looks how is irrelevant, facts matter.


Hope I'm not crushing your ego and self esteem too much, but you are too insignificant to be able to offend me in any sense, shape or form.


This argument is a powerful one, and one that most big blockers cannot answer. Or better yet, those who demand "*Low fees now!!!*".
As far as my main contribution is concerned, I educate noobs and provide a balanced view of Bitcoin. That it's not yet ready for prime time, but that it nevertheless has already achieved a lot. That low fees for coffee purchases will come, and that the future of finance will not be made of big blocks. And all of this with arguments and facts at hand.You are witnessing this effort right now, as you read this. Under normal circumstances, this would not necessarily be a particularly big contribution, but with the level of shilling, FUD and mis-information running rampant around here, it's more important than ever.
So I'll flip the question to you - What have YOU done for Bitcoin? You are clearly concern trolling, but that is actually against Bitcoin. 
And my original sanctimonious attitude is still going strong - Fuck you and all those who demand "Low fees now!!!" to buy coffee and for tipping. There's MUCH MORE to Bitcoin that that. And if we start with helping businesses exist that will pay employees in their LOCAL FIAT currency, and we address fees in 2yrs from TODAY, it will still be fantastic. Yet, the clock is ticking for you - Yyour only "advantage" right now are low fees. And that won't last for 2yrs. I recommend checking some of the posts on the top page re LN progress. Just don't get too salty.

OK, you really need to stop this shit. How is the article fake news if it reports on an actual paper written by the Fed??? Stop the Trumpian fake news cries... just because you don't like the news, doesn't mean it's fake. The St Luis Fed published a paper on Bitcoin, which is true, and he reports on it.
As for the use cases, the paper points out there are some pretty good ones. But of course, this all takes some time. The world moves along the path of least resistance, and it's a fact that Bitcoin offers less friction in, say, international payments, than traditional banking. I don't know about you, but I did have to transfer large sums of money internationally on more than one occasion. The cost and timelines are significant. So there are very good use cases RIGHT NOW. Along with the, as I already mentioned, censorship resistance and it's permissionless nature. And this is just the beginning. 
Finally, after this I'm done with you, that the ECB has come out saying banks need to step up their game to compete with cryptos, should kill most of your claims that "there's no use for Bitcoin". If there was no use for it, banks wouldn't have to increase their competitiveness. [Here]( another piece of fake news, since you obviously won't like the implications of it.

They don't "lie", they just don't understand what the fuck they are talking about. Like you.
ETH can process ~3x the BTC txs per second. That's not scaling, that's kicking the can down the road. Also, ETH is struggling under the weight of its own success - Another dapp or two like Crypto Kittens, and it will collapse. ETH has *serious and pressing* scaling issues, not BTC. And their devs know it.
Now instead of trying to be a smart ass, try to read a bit more about this whole blockchain thingie.

I disagree with this. If you go into a bathroom, shit all over the place and some of it goes into the toilet as well, you cannot blame the toilet for not being well designed. In a similar spirit, if 27 people shit in said toilet without flushing, you can't blame the toilet system for overflowing.
The technology is sound and robust, as demonstrated by the 100% up-time. It's the user experience that is currently under stress, and that can happen with any technology if used inappropriately.
This is an attack on Bitcoin - CB refusing to activate SegWit, yet they were a vocal proponent of S2X, which included SegWit!!! Unfortunately Bitcoin is victim of it's own success, and now has to go through growing pains of giant players thinking they can do whatever they want. Reminds one of the early days of the Internet, when companies were trying to "control the Internet". 
It might take some time, but if CB doesn't get their act straight and play fair, the market will punish them. Only problem, that twat of a CEO is already rich... he should lose everything in the process as well.

You are a huge proponent of BTC, yet here you are concern trolling. Or maybe you just don't know how to express yourself better and are using terms like "huge expenses" because you've never been thought to choose your words more carefully. I'll take a stab anyway.
Let's see... at current prices, a standard txs MultiSig --&gt; Segwit + P2PKH will be ~470b. At current mempool load, you'll be fine with 200sat/b, so a total fee of ~0.0001BTC. That's ~$13.5. You wanna be aggressive? OK, say you go with ~400sat/b and your fee is ~$30, so ~$60 if you open AND close a channel.
Credit cards charge anywhere between 3%-5% per transaction. So out of every $1000 of stuff sold, you simply cannot escape the $30-$50 fee. If, instead of $1000 you sell $2000 worth of goods, you are already better off, with **very aggressive fees**. What if that channel stays open for $10,000 worth of sales? The fee becomes negligible. And since you are no longer paying those costs, you can lower the prices... so the consumer has to spend less on your goods, and hence be much more inclined to pay the fees to open a channel.
And what if your supplier accepts LN payments? Well, then you don't even to touch the blockchain... so why would you?!?!?
In the long term, the blockchain will be expensive, as it should (!!), since block space is scarce and a precious resource. Guess what happens? Everybody in the ecosystem is incentivised to transact off-chain! So no, you won't be touching those channels very often. And this becomes even more true if 'channel factories' are introduced - You can have channel capacity re-arrangements without touching the blockchain. 
And, of course, all of this doesn't even include paying with alts through atomic swaps and/or sidechains.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:12:31

@_date: 2018-01-14 15:55:58
You don't understand, you truly don't... you think you do, but you don't.
I'll give it a shot. The number of txs per block is very relevant, and it shows that people in BCH are A LOT MORE WASTEFUL than BTC. Why? Because it's "cheap". Guess what happens when this behaviour becomes a lot more popular? Not only you don't get 8x the amount of txs, but you start running into **the same "problems" Bitcoin has**, i.e. high fees. And you get there **much faster**, because everyone is simply wasteful.
If this continues, you can expect 300+sat/b txs becoming standard VERY SOON. And I claim it will continue. Give it another 3 months.

Dud are you playing dumb or seriously not understanding? If you want to make a payment with crypto you'll need to start your wallet app. When you do that, it'll check your channels automatically.

"It's not" refers to "solid evidence", and of that I'm sure. I'm sure that just looking at the mempool chart is no solid evidence of a UTXO set mess. Say CB had all their coins in a single UTXO, and processed every single txs independently, it would still result in a giant mempool. Also, the mempool doesn't tell you **who** is moving coins, so if there's ANOTHER entity moving coins like CB you've got the exact same mess of a mempool. And that's assuming allthe coins are in a single UTXO.
I know CB is a mess, not disputing that. Just wanted to get more details on the specific claim that their UTXOs are a mess, not just lack of SegWit and txs batching.

There is some truth to that - In the *Western World*, whatever that means, the use case for Bitcoin **is** much smaller than elsewhere. But that's nothing new under the sun, those who have it best are the most reluctant to change. Go figure.
But this Western World you bring up is NOT THE ENTIRE WORLD. It really isn't, even though it might cause an itch to overzealous people. And when you consider other countries, those where the situation is most dire are the ones who will be most happy to try alternatives, and they are doing it! So what happens when, say, an Asian textile manufacturing plant doing work for Nike asks to be paid in Bitcoin? OK, so maybe Nike is too big and can impose whatever they want, but I hope you get my point - What happens when our trading partners start asking for Bitcoin instead of USD? Simple, you start paying them in Bitcoin! All of a sudden, a Bitcoin economy develops.
So perhaps the road to mainstream acceptance goes through becoming the medium of exchange for international business first. 
And let's say you then go on holiday abroad. Why bother with exchange rates, if you can pay directly in Bitcoin? Maybe yo go to one of those worse off countries, and find shops that take Bitcoin. How does that impact you? Well, you simply start getting used to it! So when you go back to your Western World country, you'll be a tad more used to paying with Bitcoin. Given enough people, which in today's global economy is not all that difficult to achieve, paying with Bicoin may just become an everyday thing.
Now... if you're from the US, where ~70% don't even have a passport, then yes, adoption will certainly be slower.

It is an increase on node burden... with SegWit, blocks are larger, up to 4MB in some pathological cases. This puts burden on the network, certainly in terms of bandwidth constraints, if not on the CPU/storage requirements to validate them.
It's one of the technical reasons why 2X was rejected, it'd bring max block size to 8MB. And there were political reasons, but that's another story.

And if one of the parties wants to cheat, claim more money than they have, let's say after paying you but claiming the state from before the payment... well, that's when you have the option to present a counter claim, which is more recent, and the network will recognize as valid + the cheating attempt. The net result is that you get ALL the funds, and the cheater NONE. So this is a strong deterrent against cheating. And all of this is enforced by the blockchain... so same security, but plenty of advantages.

There's more to an economy than the average person. And businesses transact with $20k very often, and increasingly across borders. Maybe you don't like it, which is also understandable, but we have a global economy which ain't going away. Sending money to my clients/suppliers across the border without the delays and hassle of a bank is extremely valuable.
We're not in full adoption yet, but it's coming. If you can't see it, that's your problem.

Yes... problem is you never know when is the correction coming. There was a guy who posted about buying a fuckton of alts last year and got severely punished. He bought 600BTC (!!!!) @ ~$2k, and then spent a significant chunk of those on Siacoin @ 700sat. Basically didn't see the correction and next thing you know SC is ~100sat. Or ~250sat now, but don't know what he did. He's prob still up in USD, but would have made an absolute killing if he simply didn't touch any freaking alts at all.

No. You clearly do not understand what's the role of full nodes. Hint: They validate every single txs and block, and REJECT invalid ones. So miners cannot just assign themselves a 50BTC Coinbase txs, it would get rejected and they'd get nothing.

Lol So we went from fake news to it all looks very sketchy. Your mental gymnastics is top notch.
In any event, I told you a few days ago that it's still "early days". That's what "the potential is not fully realised yet" means. And of course no one can predict with certainty what will be the future, they are just covering their ass. But unless you are blind, the signs are clearly pointing to increased global adoption. An article on the front page right now concludes that
"The USD won't be challenged by EUR, CNY or BTC anytime soon" 
as world reserve currency. The key here is that Bitcoin is openly being discussed as a reserve currency, and just a year ago anyone daring to say it would have been met with ridicule. It still doesn't mean it will happen, but the shift in narrative is real. Even if you would prefer it to not be the case. Lol

Don't! You're almost guaranteed to fail miserably at what you're trying to do, and lose money.
If you want to try, take a portion, say 10%-20%. Alts had a giant bull run in Q1-Q2 2017, and then spent the rest of the year declining in BTC terms. Will happen again, IMO. So if you want to play the market, do it with a fraction of your coins.

If blocks stay at 1MB, and bandwitdh keeps increasing as in the past, or approximately so, validating the full block chain won't be a problem. But I agree some "checkpoints" are most likely the way to go, and then leave it only to some archivial nodes to store absolutely everything.
As for the fees, read [this]( peper... the reason why people were "happy" when fees went very high up is because it was a hint of Bitcoin becoming self sustainable. There were a few blocks where the fees exceeded the current block reward!!! So in the future, if you can count on ~10BTC in fees per block, that's arguably enough to sustain the network. This is, btw, one of the main reasons for keeping blocks small - High on-chain fees are the price to pay for a healthy and self-sustainable network.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:11:47

What are you talking about? If I'm in the market of selling luxury goods, I couldn't care less about cheaper goods, even though they may make tons of money for others. Perhaps closer to Bitcoin, UPS/FedEx and such don't care about $1 mail, and only focus on higher value packages. Likewise, some miners will only mine txs with fees they choose.
Are they doing it to control/influence the market? Yes, sure. But that doesn't mean it's not free market. And it's the free market that will force them to act differently, by punishing them economically. Everyone competes for higher fee txs, and if you neglect the lower fee ones, you are leaving money on the table. At some point, they will be forced to go after those fees as well. Until then, they will continue to act as every monopolist in history ever has.

Value of money = Trust we put in it.
Fiat is not worthless, it is actually valuable for daily life in (economically) stable countries. It has "no intrinsic value", but that doesn't make it worthless if we entrust our wealth in it. And by "we" I mean a significant portion of the population.
Bitcoin is similar... it has no "intrinsic value", but people around the world are starting to trust it, and that's why the value is going up. The "increase in fiat value" is, hopefully, only temporary. What I mean is that in ~20yrs, if Bitcoin becomes completely established for the common person across the world, it becomes a "normal thing", then the value won't be raising nowhere near as much. It will, in fact, be stable. So temporary here is a few decades, which is a blip for history.
At that point, the FX BTCUSD, BTCEUR, BTCJPY, ... won't matter as we'll trust it and be happy to express value in Bitcoin. Well, that's the hope, anyway.

I disagree with this. If you go into a bathroom, shit all over the place and some of it goes into the toilet as well, you cannot blame the toilet for not being well designed. In a similar spirit, if 27 people shit in said toilet without flushing, you can't blame the toilet system for overflowing.
The technology is sound and robust, as demonstrated by the 100% up-time. It's the user experience that is currently under stress, and that can happen with any technology if used inappropriately.
This is an attack on Bitcoin - CB refusing to activate SegWit, yet they were a vocal proponent of S2X, which included SegWit!!! Unfortunately Bitcoin is victim of it's own success, and now has to go through growing pains of giant players thinking they can do whatever they want. Reminds one of the early days of the Internet, when companies were trying to "control the Internet".
It might take some time, but if CB doesn't get their act straight and play fair, the market will punish them. Only problem, that twat of a CEO is already rich... he should lose everything in the process as well.

Exactly. So Bitcoin, with 9yrs of existence, is already doing something 2000+yrs of banking didn't do.


Which requires the traditional banking services. No shit that those who HAVE access to traditional banking are the ones who stand to gain the least, you're a genius aren't you? But guess what? They are the BANKED, not the unbanked. So the article I showed demonstrates that Bitcoin is already starting to do exactly what it set out to do. More will come, only need patience.




You'll need to get off your lazy ass, and take your own financial security in your own hands. And the questions you raise are also fairly dumb and demonstrate your narrow mindedness. You are comparing a 50+yr old, mature technology with a baby. Go talk to your grandparents and ask them how enthusiastic they were to use plastic cards instead of cash when it first came out. The concept of "it takes time" is completely lost on you. What is also lost on you is that there are people who DON'T have access to the VISA network altogether, back to my point above.




In case you missed it, the Internet is a new for of communication. Publishers were laughing just as hard as you are now at the suggestion that the Internet can disrupt them. So yes, you keep laughing, I'll keep educating people AND investing in Bitcoin. I'm a patient man, let's see who will have the final laugh. 
I'll just end this by quoting Satoshi, not because I consider him a God like many do, but because the quote is actually spot on:

Bitcoin's anti-fragility doesn't come from the tech itself, as if that tech is somehow magic and above all forms of attack and/or destruction. Instead, Bitcoin's anti-fragility comes from various forms, the community being one of them. (And yes, the tech as well.) As a community we protect Bitcoin in any way we can - Fighting disinformation, FUD and shills, spreading the word, running full nodes and more. Also fighting/exposing bad actors, those in a position to damage Bitcoin. And this fight might even include a class action.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:00:58
the response you got is actually true, but it irks ETH heads to point it out. ETH was the first ICO in history, and was pre-mined to sell. The supply is not capped, unless there's been changes lately... not really following development of poopcoins a that much. And the DAO fork *has* been coordinated by a small number of people, with Vitalik literally asking exchanges to stop trading so the fork could be put in place.

@_date: 2018-01-24 16:42:34


That's because you never really spent more than 15min reading and thinking about it.
ETH can handle approx 3x the BTC transactions. That's not scale, that's kicking the can down the road. It's also why it can (currently) handle more transactions, and why these are still confirmed in a short time compared to BTC.
Guess what all the popularity of ETH did? In particular CryptoKitties? It congested the network to the point that some ICOs had to be canceled or delayed *because of network delays*. (Google it, I don't support lazy reading.) Guess what happened to the fees? Yep, they started climbing. Again, Google is your friend. The fees are lower? Yes, because 1 ETH = 0.1 BTC!!! The fees are correspondingly that much lower. (If this is not clear to you, you should rethink this whole fee thingie again.)
And now we have the basics for the "scaling is worse off" claim. CryptoCelebrties is coming. And so is FishWars. These are known, but I'm betting more is coming, and not yet revealed. What happens if these dapps reach the same level of popularity of the CryptoKitties? Total. Network. Congestion. The kind that is not driven by spam, but by crazy demand. In other words, ETH becomes a victim of its own success. And this is rapidly approaching, these dapps will be released **very soon**. So the urgency for ETH to scale is real.
ETH devs, of course, know this. Again Google around to see some of the concerns. And are not happy, just like the early-adopter community is not. So yeah, ETH has a real urgent scaling problem, Bitcoin does not.

Escrow with multisig addresses.
Now that I think of it, it's even better because it acts as deterrent for the merchant to cheat. Today he knows you'll charge the credit card Co, so he doesn't care and gets the money. With Bitcoin, he doesn't get the money until he delivers. And the escrow will be cheap, every idiot and his mom could set up a multisig address and ask for proof of shipping/delivery before releasing the funds. So cost of entry is pretty low.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:22:48
One thing the dev team knows for sure is that YOU didn't do anything to make BTC what it is. The dev team also knows that the financial future will not be made of big blocks. The dev team also knows that there're MANY MORE use cases to Bitcoin than tipping and buying coffee.
So yeah, if your main goal is to tip and buy coffee, then you should definitely use a coin no one uses... like BCash. Fees will definitely be lower. For now.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:29:15
As of now, there are ~6,000txs with a fee higher than yours, and ~15,000txs with a fee similar to yours. You can fit ~2,000txs per block, so if everyone stopped transacting, you'd get confirmed in ~10 blocks. But that's not gonna happen, so you'll need to be more patient.

This is an attack on Bitcoin - CB refusing to activate SegWit, yet they were a vocal proponent of S2X, which included SegWit!!! Unfortunately Bitcoin is victim of it's own success, and now has to go through growing pains of giant players thinking they can do whatever they want. Reminds one of the early days of the Internet, when companies were trying to "control the Internet".
It might take some time, but if CB doesn't get their act straight and play fair, the market will punish them. Only problem, that twat of a CEO is already rich... he should lose everything in the process as well.

No need to rethink absolutely anything. Sorry to pop your bubble, but you're not saying anything new. What you say is precisely the reason why this community insists SO MUCH on only investing what you can afford lose. In case you missed it, until a few days ago, the top and stickied post was "Don't invest recklessly", written by the mods. Which also means you won't have to sell at the wrong time.
Also, some analyst suggested the Bitcoin bubble may already have burst in 2014, when it collapsed around 90%. And this was not one Bitcoin cheerleader (his words, IIRC). And now it was in the shooting over phase.
So yeah, it might be a bubble... So what?

The main reason for it, and it relates to any investment, is your emotional response, more than anything else.
If you are emotionally strongly invested in that money, like you seem to be, you are likely to pull the trigger in all the wrong moments. Like you are subconsciously thinking of doing now. (At least that's how I'm reading your situation.) But if you don't give a damn, because the money is not all that important, aka you can afford to lose it, you won't be tempted to sell on a dip because... who cares!
Put differently, if you only invest what you can afford to lose, you are more likely to come out of it successfully than burned.
As for what to do now, I'll just tell you I am not selling. I think this is a temporary lull, and we'll get back to the pre-Korea FUD levels. Your tax situation also favours hodling a little longer. Bit that's just me, and I don't have any emotional attachment to your money...

The similarly is uncanny. And there was bubbling in the Bitcoin price for sure. But where that comparison breaks down is... do you want to figure it out yourself?
OK, it's in the role of 'institutional money'. Which has not entered the game yet. So if Bitcoin will ever bust spectacularly, I don't think it will by let's play into it, we need to wait for the full cycle to play out, and get big money to get involved first.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:54:51
OK, fair enough... so let's see:
1) Bitcoin **already has** Rootstock deployed. Sidechain, with merged mining, supported by the biggest miners, including Bitmain, and smart contract capabilities. It allows for ~2000 txs/s.
2) The LN for Bitcoin is closer and closer, by the day. I trust you've seen posts here recently where mainnet LN txs have been carried out.
So, given the above, can you tell me which other coin, or startup, or whatever you prefer, is closer to delivering scale? Not just pie in the sky "someone is doing it". Specific examples where people are very close to deliver, or almost, and for which chain. I'm not saying there isn't... but would like to know who and for which coin. (If you say ETH, which is the only other coin that can compete with BTC in terms of development, you should look up at the differences between the two... they are not competitors.)

If they're from an exchange you're good to go... exchanges don't like to touch tainted coins.

You kidding? Conbase has been on the side of every contentious (and failed!) bitcoin fork so far. They are having an arms race with BitPay on who's gonna be the most hostile bitcoin service. An arms race to the bottom.
(But I will give them credit for implementing SegWit much sooner than most. That is true and fair.)
@_date: 2019-07-01 01:18:48
So you made a bank txfer to coinbase, or some other exchange. OK, it's the first step. Now the exchange has the coins, not you. They have them in custody, and they should give them to you when you ask, but they're not in your control. To control the coins you need indeed a wallet. Think of a wallet like a personal bank, which **you** need to secure and take care of.
So, next steps.... Depends on what you want to do with the coins. If this is a long term investment, get a hardware wallet like Trezor and move the coins to it and forget about it for 5+ yrs. If you want to spend the coins and have them on your PC, get a desktop wallet like Wasabi or Electrum. (Warning!! Read around here about the phishing attacks on Electrum, you may end up getting the wrong wallet.) Then install on your machine and move the coins to it. If you want to have your coins on the go, get a mobile wallet like Greenaddress or Samurai and move the coins to it. If you want to try with the LN, then look for something like Zap wallet, or Acinq/Eclair. Then you'll be able to spend them on the LN for stupid low fees.

Blockchain is a hostile company to bitcoin. It sounds odd, but it is. The supported a hostile takeover attempt of the bitcoin network in 2017 because, they were saying, they needed more block space.

Almost two years after SegWit got activated on bitcoin (Aug 2017) they STILL DON'T HAVE IT. This not only hurts their clients, but everyone else since the more people use SegWit the better it is for everyone. Avoid blockchain.con as the plague.

What your coins are worth is always determined by the current exchange price, but that doesn't mean your coins need to be on an exchange. My coins in cold storage are just as valuable as your coins on an exchange. Difference is mine are controlled by me, yours are controlled by the exchange. And then there's the ease of sale aspect - If you want to trade them fast, keep them on an exchange. But that's not what a long term investment is. If you want a LT investment and hodl, then a cold storage wallet is the right way to do it. Will also prevent you from panic selling at the bottom because your coins will not be on the exchange.

Absolutely is. The theory I outlined above. History, show me ONE example of society **of similar size to today's country states** that has managed to pay for public services out of voluntary contributions. Zero.


Yes, in a 1,000 people society. Not for a 300m one. 


Again, this falls apart as soon as you allow free riders. "If he's not paying, why should I???"


Of course there is... Let's call it the free rider problem. For the third time, the game theory is unstable and a race to the bottom.


No, that's your wishful thinking, your day dreams, your wet desires, not reality. 


That it's necessary for civil society at the current scale to exist. Theft leads to a breakdown of society, taxation enables it. I know this rubs you wrong, but it's nonetheless true. If nothing else, taxes pay for police to enforce some order. (Not saying it's perfect in the US, btw...)


Of course it is... by staying you agree to pay taxes, it's the social contract. Your staying is voluntary, I already argued above.
Last thing, I'll note you completely ignored the link I posted. You should (re-)read the firefighters example and think about it carefully. Private firefighters have been tried in history, it doesn't work. Hence public service, paid for via taxation. Voluntary.

A similar thing probably holds for coinjoined/mixed coins. Try mixing some (Wasabi or Samourai wallets allow you to do that) and then sending to an exchange. Chances are they'll lock you out and ask for explanations why are your coins mixed.
This is where new solutions like Schnorr sigs, taproot, graftroot, MAST etc become important. Make all the txs look the same, so an exchange could never know if coins were mixed or not.

I've noticed the same... The only thing that comes to mind is that people are learning to set custom fees to avoid overpaying.
If you look at it in a longer time scale, you'll see that over time, the avg fee for a certain number of unconfirmed txs gets lower. Say 100k unconfirmed txs, 3 months ago would have been ~500+sat/b, now it's ~140sat/b.
The reality of limited block space is forcing people to be more rational about how they set their fees. Just my theory anyway.

Check the mempool... Basically every block clears it out. So no, they are not refusing to mine small fee Bcash txs.

This will be unpopular but... there's nothing strange with this, nothing wrong with it, and should be expected from more and more banks.
Storing money securely has a cost. You can think of old fashioned gold in a safe, protecting that from thieves has a cost, and historically banks have always charged a fee to store money. Even in the modern age, when things are electronic, the cost has not disappeared. Servers, coders, etc... all costs money. 
If interest rates are sufficiently high, the bank could not only give you a free account, but also offer an interest rate for money sitting in the account. This is coming to an end, however, with yields going into negative territory almost worldwide. But the bank still has a cost base, and the only way to do this is to charge people for accounts. That the account is free if you have more than $10k is because they can earn the account fee by lending out your money. Less than $10k, and they are at a loss. No business will do it for a long time.
You think things are different with Bitcoin, and to some extent they are. But even with Bitcoin you have players like Casa, which offers... custody for a cost. Of course, the difference is that with Bitcoin you can keep your money safe without a custodian, but with fiat this is basically impossible. And even so, most people don't know how to, or don't want to bother with securing their own money. That's why custodians will continue to exist.

This is where you need to go beyond "code" and the "vacuum" to understand it. The miners are real world economic actors. This means they are in it to make money. A pretty obvious way to make money is to just mine and that's it. Profit (almost) guaranteed. What happens if miners collude to 51%? Think about the bitcoin price, and remember that a 51% will, at best, be able to double spend a txs + censor some transactions. Very simply, a sustained 51% on bitcoin would destroy the confidence in it, and the price would crater. So profit is gone. There's more - Miners still need to pay for: equipment + electricity + labour + warehouse rent. If the revenue collapses suddenly, these costs still need to be met. Would you 51% attack bitcoin when facing huge operational costs? This is a bit like calling your boss an a or trying to get her fired, when you have a mortgage + car loan + kids to support. Would you do it?
A 51% can be done, but at huge cost. A nation state could, in principle, decide to attack bitcoin and the cost to do so would not be too significant for a country like the US. BUT! It's not like just throwing $$$ at it and boom, problem solved, bitcoin gone. To attack bitcoin they would first need to **DOUBLE** the current hash rate in order to do it. (And new hash rate is coming online all the time...) What's the problem with this? This is key - This new hash rate **DOES NOT EXIST**. It has to be built first. And that doesn't happen overnight. Plus it would have to be covert/top secret, or you're alerting everyone you are building new hash power, which give us time to react. But let's say you do manage to build this and keep it secret. A simple proof of work algorithm **bricks** your stash of hardware, immediately. Then you need to start from scratch, with the knowledge that the PoW algo can be changed again. And again. And again... as many times as necessary. It quickly becomes very expensive to do. Plus think about the media backlash, people protesting, etc. Are you sure you want to do it?
In short, a 51% is not **impossible**, it is just extremely costly to do, no matter how you look at it. As Satoshi says in the white paper, "a node ought to find it more profitable to be honset". Basically it's economic game theory that prevents it from happening.

Nope. Taxes are part and parcel of the social contract. If you don't want it, you can leave. As in leave the country you live in. Ron Hubbard did it, he went to live in international waters. You can't do it? Tough shit, you pay up like everyone else.
Truth is that you are free to leave - free as in free speech, not free beer - and if you can't afford it, that's your problem, not mine. I know that **I want** the government to collect taxes from you, so you can blame me for it. And I want it because otherwise it would be a race to the bottom, who is paying less. With the result that society would collapse.

OR... and that's where the piggy bank comes in, you can "unseal it", to reveal the private key and spend it online. In this second case, use number one becomes invalid, because people will see that it's been "unsealed/broken".

One of the problems to establish futures is that you need clean prices. Somehow, you need to be able answer the question: 
"What is the Bitcoin price?" 
Sounds simple, but it's tricky because you need transparency. 
Once you have this in place, you can say
"At close of business today, the price was $X"
which is the piece of info you use to settle daily. So the exchange will move money between clients depending on the price movements every day. This is to avoid problems like the price has gone too far against you, and you don't have money to settle all at the end.

Some people like to complain about "high fees" in BTC. The graph above shows how many unconfirmed txs are in BTC, and it groups the txs by fee, lowest fee at the bottom. As expected, miners prefer hi-fee txs, which is absolutely fine.
For about a month now, there's been a backlog of &lt;5sat/b txs pending unconfirmed - The blue area. Overnight, miners started to confirm the backlog of 5-10sat/b txs, the red are. And then, from ~2am to 8am EST, there's been a *steady increase* of some of the cheapest txs, which is what I highlighted. 
It's anybody's guess as to who did this. It could have been a big BTC Co consolidating their coins to avoid spending high fees in the future. But this kind of activity has been seen in the past, and though never 100% confirmed nor admitted, there was a certain body of evidence that the network was being flooded with spam txs. 
Who would benefit from this? Let's say you want to push an agenda, like increasing the block size, and are trying to make everybody's life miserable to achieve this. You could spam the network with tiny low fee txs, so everybody has to pay higher fees. If you're a miner, you get some of those fees back anyway, eventually. And what you lose, could easily be offset by the fees that you collect in the meantime. Say you spend 1BTC in spam fees, you get back 1BTC because you control 10% of the hash rate, but as a result of the attack you get 10BTC in higher fees, your total net is 1BTC. Profit.
This may sound conspiratorial, but the incentives are there. And this steady influx of txs at ungodly hours is anything bu "normal course of business"... in the latter case, the increase would be more random, like the txs you see on the top of the graph. 
You decide.

Bitfinex does not finance their operations on credit, at least not that we know of. They do have problems with banking relationships, the legacy financial system. And Tether only recently stepped up to help them out, when authorities in the EU, iirc, withheld their money. All of which happened because the legacy system is giving them a hard time. Bitfinex is profitable.

Very risky, but others already told you this. I guess there may be a way to check if it's okay, compare the firmware with the official one. In particular the model T allows people to mess with the firmware, think it was designed like that intentionally so people could play with it. So the risk is whoever sold you the device messed with the firmware. See their website if there's a way to restore the original firmware and/or check if current is legit.
Another thing to try... After wiping firmware, deposit 0.001BTC, or so, and let it sit there. If it disappears, you know what happened.
Warning: I'm not an expert!! So no guarantee this would eliminate all the risk. For absolute peace of mind buy another one directly from the manufacturer, and return this one. (If bought on eBay, you should be able to, no?)

You bitcoin "isn't anywhere". Your bitcoin is simply an entry in bitcoin's ledger, and every node keeps track of all the entries in this ledger. When you spend bitcoin you are simply changing the entry in the ledger, so instead of saying SD_SeaDonkey - 1BTC it will now say SD_SeaDonkey - 0.5 BTC and DesignerAccount - 0.5 BTC. (In practice this looks like coins associated to some public address.)
Question is, how can you change this entry? And the answer lies in cryptography. You need the private key. So Trezor, in fact, contains a whole bunch of private keys, which is all you need to spend coins. It's this collection of private keys that gives your wallet "the authority to send/receive bitcoin".

How about you get a bit more educated and read some article about ETH scaling? You know, instead of talking shit. [Here]( for your reading and educational pleasure.

For someone who's been in crypto for a long time, you still don't really get AML/KYC. Do you really think banks **want** to do it? If you just answered yes, you don't understand banks at all. All banks want is money, they don't give a shit where the money is coming from, or who has it. And it costs banks money to set up compliance programs + they turn away customers = Less money for the bank!
It's the law to do AML/KYC. You quite simply cannot have a bank if you don't have an AML/KYC program, period. So you have two choices - Do what the government says and still make very good money, or not have a business.
Crypto exchanges are now regulated in the same way.

Miners are already looking to relocate from China... eyeing Russia, I believe. It's not a hypothetical anymore, the real fight seems to be picking up. Like you say, full nodes can be hidden, and if miners are shut down, a hard fork with diff adjustment for CPU mining again and we're done. But if running a full node costs $100/month, no one would do it, and then it's game over.  Think about it.

Fees can get high when you send BTC. If you are not careful, and use some stupid software, you can end up paying €10 in fee even if you're sending only €5, say. My suggestion, learn how to set custom fees and how to estimate an appropriate fee before you move BTC to avoid this. Then, when the LN is in place, it'll be all different.

It's not a magic number, and I've previously argued that [it's not about block size.]( 
So you seem to agree that a block cap should be set? If so, it might as well be 1MB... why not? I'll tell you why yes: Because it makes running a full node acceptably cheap. Helps keeping the network decentralized. And before you start telling me how, say, 8MB would compromise and it'd be all hunky dory, right now with SegWit and actual blocks not even reaching full capacity, guys in Australia are saying it's challenging for them to run a full node. Not storage... think bandwidth. And if a first world country has those problems, let's not even start discussing third world countries.

And as you said in the other sub, your comment is garbage, or almost.
This is a study which doesn't refer to any specific good in particular, like the marshmallow. It's about delayed gratification. 
And the analogy is a pretty good one, actually. The kids had to **trust** the researcher that there would actually be another marshmallow after 15min. So it was a gamble, guaranteed one now or maybe two later. 
Yes, it is likely that the kids believed there was going to be another one later, but the gamble is still there. Plenty of people who, like the kids, believed in BTC sold early, for that quick gratification. Of course, many still hodl, and are taking the gamble further.
And if you think that delayed gratification has got nothing to do with investment gains, ask Warren Buffet what [he thinks]( of it.

No it was not. Stop with this "Holy Scriptures (TM)" interpretation that Roger and  are force feeding you. We don't know what Satoshi wanted, and he's not around to tell us. So lacking this, we need to do our best to scale the system by preserving as many of the original features... First and foremost decentralisation. And if you don't see how big blocks increase centralisation, I think I'm just not gonna keep the conversation going.

Nonsense. Of course you do... what this means is "*Be patient for a little longer. For now, keep using plastic and/or fiat if you're in a rush or if it is more convenient. The solution is on its way.*"


Nonsense. Of course Bitcoin works. Maybe it doesn't work for micropayments, fair enough, but Bitcoin works with 100% reliability. The entire ecosystem is not mature yet, so some uses are simply not convenient, but Bitcoin works. For now, it's probably best to see Bitcoin a bit like FedEx - Will do the job well and fast, but you'll pay the fee. In addition, if you're happy to wait, it will also do the job cheaply.


Well, then Bitcoin is the King... you can transfer coins between addresses with 100% reliability. And the dust sitting in addresses now will again become extremely usable once Schnorr is deployed. Again, a little patience. Or, if you're in a rush, how about you start coding yourself??


You don't understand the main protection/mechanism against spam... Breaking news, it's the price. Let's say that BTC = $1m. You can bet your a$$ there won't be any spam, too freaking expensive. And the same spam problem affects every other blockchain coin - Say ETH or BCH. 1 BCH and I can send 100,000,000 txs of 1sat with zero fee. (Don't know if they have a min fee...) If BCH allows 0-fee, then I could cripple (DDOS) the network just like that. Hope they have some min fees.


For now. Blockchains are **absolutely terrible** at scaling. The problems BTC is having should be SO very welcomed by everyone else, because it gives them a glimpse in the future, should they ever achieve scale, that is. [Here's and article]( about blockchain scaling with ETH as focus. Also, go talk to the ETH guys how happy they are now that [fucking kittens]( make up for a significant portion of their txs. That's an impending disaster... ETH is on a tight clock here: If that game explodes in popularity, as silly stupid games often do, it will completely cripple the network. Do you have your popcorn ready?
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:50:14
BCH has not technical merits beyond the technical merits of Bitcoin up to about a year ago. But the main problem with BCH is that they are convinced it can scale on-chain, which it cannot. Blockchains are actually awful at scaling because it's basically a very inefficient database. Also, some quick maths should convince you very easily that on-chain scaling is no go. I've written about it [here]( focusing on the s-curve and mass adoption. There are many other arguments, but you'll need to google a bit to find articles about those. Also, [an interesting tweet]( from the Microsoft head of decentralized identity on the subject.
Having said that, the amount of time spent promoting BCash is astounding, so it might well make you money in the short term, if you sell at the right time. But if the adoption of it explodes, like many people in r-btc hope/believe, that will also be the end of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:09:48
What an absolutely beautiful image!
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:19:10
SegWit is not the final solution to scaling, off chain solutions will be, starting with LN. Until those are much more widely available, SegWit offers congestion relief. A 100% SegWit adoption would do a lot for fees and congestion, so the hope is that adoption increases beyond that 10%. Large players here could do a lot, if they wanted to.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:20:33

@_date: 2017-12-09 21:37:26
That's because the exchange is paying the fee... No free lunch.
Also, Bitstamp implemented SegWit, so their fees are lower than others. That's why they are (for now) still happy to pay the fees for you.

@_date: 2017-12-31 14:20:12
Read somewhere they had/have zero fees... makes it extremely easy to manipulate price. It's also one of the reason why the price on BTC futures is *ONLY* based on exchanges with fees.
But then again... Korean's are pretty obsessed with anything crypto, so it might just be irrational exuberance on their end. (For XRP, that is. BCash was manipulated, I'm fairly convinced of this.)
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:35:25
I'm sure many will find reasons to downvote me... but here's my suggestion: Visa.
Yes, I would love to be able to spend Bitcoin just about anywhere, but we're not there yet. Also the fees for small purchases are high. So instead of congesting the network even further, wait a bit more until proper scaling is available, and in the meantime use plastic and/or fiat. Crypto will take over, just not in 2018. Nothing wrong with waiting a bit.

@_date: 2017-12-15 11:34:44
What are you talking about?? What you are seeing is effectively the emergency of a fees market. Like absolutely everything, you can pay more, and have the "premium service" or pay less, and have the "standard service". In this case, the premium service means you get to record your txs for ever and ever on the blockchain. The standard service, though, turns out to be faster and cheaper.
Again, this narrative that people are forcing this or that is flawed. Nobody is forcing anything. Other have options, and like in every market, there are tiers with different price entry points.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:37:33

You've got things a bit upside down... Nobody wants high fees, only people are aware that those low fees will require off chain scaling. And are patiently waiting. 
On chain fees, on the other hand, will remain high.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:24:31
Signatures are a significant part of the txs, don't have exact nrs at hand, but it's significant - Think ~40% type significant. The real problem, however, comes when you're trying to make a payment from multiple inputs. 
Say you've been using BTC for a few years, and have been using a wallet that will not re-use the address. You will most likely have your coins scattered across several addresses. This is where the problem comes in: Each of those input addresses will require a separate signature, so the total signature size can easily become ~80+% of a very large-sized txs: Very many inputs, one single output. 
Basically Schnorr will allow to recover a ton of dust coins sitting in wallets all over, which cannot be used now because of the txs fees. Of course, no company crying for bigger blocks now will thank Core for making it possible to collect all the dust they accumulated.

Indirectly it does push fees up as you are establishing a floor on the fees. If the natural floor is 1sat/b, now it becomes 30sat/b. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:13:35
Nicely written... that's why the introduction of futures is such a huge thing for Bitcoin. Also tells you who the "natural sellers" of futures are: Merchants, in addition to miners. Merchants cannot say "1BTC is 1BTC", just like international US companies cannot say "1GBP is 1GBP". If they account their books in USD, they will sell FX futures, to lock in their profits in USD. That's what large merchants can do with BTC... Bring on the LN!!!
The BTC future is bright!

This is very useful, thanks!
One comment on crypto-for-crypto... What you say is certainly true in the new tax bill, for 2018, not sure about 2017. Reason is the like-for-like trade, which applies to *property* now, but only *real property* from 2018. In other words, I think one can claim like-for-like exemption for crypto-to-crypto trades. Of course, if you sell for fiat, no go.
Side note: The like-for-like exclusion can be seriously annoying. Say you trade BTC @ $10k for LTC @ 0.02BTC. You end buying BTC again at 0.01, so you only get back half of your BTC. Meanwhile, 1BTC goes to $30k... you stiil "made $5k" and need to pay taxes on it. FFS, **I LOST 0.5 BTC!!!** lol. Oh well.

That is true for all cryptos... and guess what? No coin has solved scaling. None. I don't give a shit of what example you're gonna try to bring, none has scaled.

@_date: 2017-12-14 18:42:11
Please stop talking nonsense. NONE of the coins you mention has scaling sorted. The only reason why they don't have scaling problems *now* is because they don't have scale. Take BCH... ~130 txs on avg per block! What scale??

The current limit for ETH is about 15txs/s, which is certainly higher than BTC, no one is claiming otherwise, but it's also  pretty low, if you want to compete with VISA.

* Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and volatility is only expected. It is due to lack of market depth, certainly Citi's traders would agree, which will increase once traditional financial institutions come in play. This already started with LedgerX, CME and CBOE already offering derivatives trading, many ETFs requesting SEC approval and of course, perhaps most importantly, Goldman Sachs setting up a cryptocurrency trading desk in H1 2018. Will Citi be a dynamic bank for the 21st century and join the revolution, or sit on the sideline awaiting its demise?
* Bitcoin creation is less wasteful than maintaining server farms for traditional banking. Or mining gold. Bitcoin's security is sustained by this alleged "wastefulness" and has reached such level that it is simply impenetrable. Bitcoin's blockchain has never been hacked, and Bitcoin's network ran with 100% uptime for the past ~6+yrs. Quantum computing cannot break SHA256 and/or RIPEMD160 cryptography, careful use of Bitcoin would not compromise the network. Quantum computing resistant cryptographic algorithms will also be deployed, so even distracted users would not be harmed.
* A report by the ECB shows that the vast majority of illegal activities happen with cash, as only cash offers truly anonymous transactions. "May" does not mean it "will", and the only informal economy Bitcoin is *guaranteed* to re-distribute wealth to is the economy of the un-banked.
* The conclusion does not follow from the premise, which is, additionally, false. Bubble claims are getting older and older by the day. In fact, Bitcoin has been pronounced "dead" more than 200 times by now. Bitcoin's "poor" design is intrinsic to ALL blockchains, other cryptocurrencies are advised to observe what happens when you reach scale, and learn. If nothing else, they should learn how to port Bitcoin's scaling solutions to their own network. The Bitcoin community welcomes competition - Bring it on! What about Citi?
* It is unclear which government Citi is referring to. China banned Bitcoin a good few times by now. Bitcoin is still around. Or is that the Japanese government, that declared Bitcoin legal tender? Or maybe it's referring to the governments of countries where monetary stability is almost a mirage? The US government? Sure, it might try... and disrupt the nascent and thriving blockchain startup economy that is creating new jobs by the day. The Bitcoin community will be amused to observe the struggle.
* Yes, a failure of Bitcoin would likely have unfavourable effects on the countries mentioned. These are risks those countries are evaluating on their own, and the Bitcoin community believes they can assess and address those risks on their own. What about the effects of Bitcoin's *success* on those, and many other, countries?
* 1 BTC = $60,000 ? That's preposterous. It's "fake Internet money", right? Besides, the most heavily invested country would seem to be Japan, if Deutsche Bank's conclusion that the price increase has been mainly driven by Japanese retail investors is to be believed. The Japanese already took action - It legalized Bitcoin. Finally, at ~$60,000 per BTC the market cap would only be ~15%-20% of gold's market cap. Why would the governments want to interfere with a network worth a small fraction of Citi's balance sheet?

They will buy BTC, and sell futures to hedge their exposure. So you may think this is all pointless because on a net basis it's even. But it's not. GS holding BTC inventory will allow institutional money to buy! Giant funds don't go to Coinbase... they call up GS to buy. And now they will be able to do it. GS will buy for $X, hedge, and sell for $X+fee, and remove the hedge. Wash, rinse and repeat.

Talking about a non congested main chain just shows how little you understand about Bitcoin. Why? 
The long term health of Bitcoin crucially relies on a healthy backlog of txs on the main chain. To incentivise miners once the block reward is no longer sufficient.
"OK, but we don't need that **now**!"
God you're predictable. If not now, when? When does a block reward based incentive switch to a fee based incentive? That's for you to answer, because you claim it's not now. For me, I don't know, but I understand it has to happen... so it might as well be now.

The "instability" is down to market depth. Basically how much money is there behind the buyers and sellers. And to how much trust we, collectively, have in BTC. The first one will improve dramatically if/when institutional money gets in the game. The second one will take longer.
Remember, we're still at a stage where many (most?) people think it's a scam/ponzi/fraud. That won't change anytime too soon. And you may think it never will, or it might. But that's up to you to make up your mind on.

If true, I have two comments for you... both to raise with internal higher-ups.
One, you should seriously consider pushing the announcement even further. The network is just not ready for the scale Amazon can provide. If you're working with CB, at least delay until they implement SegWit. And push them to do it ASAP.
Two, Amazon should support LN development and/or testing, possibly nudge CB in doing the same. Anybody who spent a good amount of time thinking about scaling knows that on-chain is NOT scaling, but LN requires more work. Amazon could greatly contribute to the LN effort by throwing "pennies" (for Amazon) at it. ANd, of course, become a LN hub in the future!

No need for you to own the funds at all. Consider the opposite situation, you open a channel with Starbucks. They don't need to fund the channel to receive the payment. Likewise, if people open 1.5BTC in channel capacity towards you, you don't own that money until people pay you.
Money in a channel is not automatic yours. It's yours only if it's on "your end" of the channel. Which it can be if you out it there, or if someone else "pushes" it to you by paying you.

Not really ELI5, and a bit long, but [here]( is a write up to explain BTC futures and their effect on price.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:51:49
PayPal only waives fees for friends and family, I think. For merchants, it may be free for you, but it's not free for the merchant. So you are raelly paying the fees through a higher cost. You can pay a bill overnight for "free", but it really isn't free, it's just that the fees are hidden elsewhere, again. But you don't see them. Western Union does one thing, and one thing only. Bitcoin is just the foundation for a new paradigm of value-transfer. WU vs Bitcoin is a bit like Fax vs Internet. Bitcoin is also a lot faster and more convenient than WU, btw.
In all three cases you mentioned, there's a third party involved. The key point behind Bitcoin is to send money without a third party. It will take time before people get their head around this aspect, but to the extent that you are happy to deal with a third party, there's no point in using Bitcoin. That's nothing new - As soon as you have a centralized company, there are massive efficiencies of scale, and you don't need a blockchain. As a matter of fact, a blockchain is a **very inefficient** database. So you need to come up with a different way to scale instead of just increasing the size of the database.
And ultimately that's a key point people supporting Bitcoin keep saying. *For the time being*, if the fees are too high, just use what you've been using up until you discovered Bitcoin. It's only the rational thing. Meanwhile, proper scaling solutions will be developed and made available for everyone, which will bring extremely low fees for everyone and for good, not just "until the next block increase".

No it won't. Please stop with the cheap, populist, uneducated rhetoric. 
There is no free lunch... so if it costs users less to send txs, somebody else is paying for it. Whether that's full node operators paying more in monthly costs, or businesses charging more, someone is paying for those txs costs. 
If you think that you are not paying for the txs costs of VISA &amp; Co, you are sorely mistaken. They are simply hidden. And with GB blocks, they will be hidden as well. You may think there are no costs because in your wallet you'll set 0.01sat/b fees and pat yourself on the back for you cheap fees, but you'll completely miss the giant pole shoved up your a$$ by the merchant who will be charging you 10% more because they are paying for those fees.

This is so powerful it cannot be overstated. 
But the author also makes a mistake - Public blockchains are ***NOT*** automatically censorship resistant. Just by opening up your blockchain to the public does not make it censorship resistant. If you/your company/your trust control the "public blockchain", it will be shut down. The only way to achieve censorship resistance is through decentralization.

Other cryptos are not solving anything, that's the hidden truth. Blockchains are terrible at scaling, absolutely terrible, and all blockchain based coins will have the same problems Bitcoin has if they reach scale. The thing is, it seems like they are solving the problem because they are not congested, but that's only because no one uses them. Guess what? Even Bitcoin had everything sorted 5 years ago, when no one would use it.
Truth is, blockchain scaling is not resolved. By far the best candidate to scale a blockchain right now is through second layer solutions. Guess who's ahead of the game? Yep... Bitcoin, ETH and LTC. BTC and LTC via LN, ETH via Raiden (I think?). Everyone else? Waiting for the big boys to deliver.
Don't fool yourself, Bitcoin is exactly where it should be and everyone else wishes they had the same problems.

As a business guy you understand there is no free lunch. If blocks get bigger, and txs fees get lower, someone still has to pay for those fees. Who? It's the full node operators... Now a node can be run 24/7 for ~$10/month. Guess what happens if that cost goes up? Right... a lot fewer nodes. I would not pay $50/month to run a node. That means centralization... No one needs an extremely inefficient database to run a coin if the result is centralization, say big businesses only. We have the Federal Reserve for that.
Bitcoin = Lean and mean nodes with off-chain scaling (i.e. small blocks)
Bitcoin Cash = Giant blocks (i.e. costly nodes, bloated blockchain, and, ultimately, centralization)

Wrong assumptions? A "banking hub" would simply route the funds from one party to the next one... so receive as much as they are sending. In other words, the return is 0.001% *per tx*... what if they do 1,000 txs per day, on average, before closing the channel? They basically pay two on-chain fees, and get 1% per day of the committed capital to cover that. If you open a large enough channel, you end up with quite the profit... say the on-chain fees are half of your txs fees, that's 0.5% per day... or ~183% per year. A pretty good return, at a time when 10Y yields are ~2.5%. Tell you what, a 5% ANNUAL return-on-capital would be EXCELLENT.
It would seem that the net result will be not 0.001%, but actually less.

Get a grip and learn how things work. Think people are saying you can send coins for 0sat/b on BCH... That means I can send 100,000,000 txs of 1sat each and NO fee, and completely clog the nodes. And then keep doing it because I'm send the coins to myself, and not paying any fees. Cost of attack? 0. And if I have to pay 1sat/b it's still pretty damn cheap. 
On chain txs MUST be expensive precisely to avoid these kinds of attack.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:27:58
The common argument for big blocks is
"*Who cares if it's too expensive to run a node at home... businesses will run nodes because it's in their interest to validate the txs. So no centralization!*"
Yes... only if it becomes very expensive to run a node, businesses will offload the cost to customers. So you are again paying for those fees, but you just don't know it.
And if it's "somewhere in the middle", someone is **still paying for those fees**. It's again the full node operators, like myself. I'm now more than happy to spend ~$10/month to run my RasPi3 24/7. If I had to pay $50/month, because a full blown machine running 24/7 is gonna rack up those costs, then no way I'd run one. Hence... centralization.

Wanted to reply to your first post and suggest you think about the fee situation in the case of a significant hash power migration... But you got there on your own. Hope that makes it clearer why, despite the obvious pain, high *on-chain* fees are extremely good for the system. Pay high fees, or be vulnerable to malicious attacks. You can say that high on-chain fees are a form of insurance, and insurance is always expensive. BCH does not realise that, and never will unless/until a malicious miner decides to mess with the chain. But then it will be too late, as the price will quickly collapse to 0.

The only question is in what order do we do that: LN first + bigger blocks later or bigger blocks now and something else (maybe) later?? See, here's the thing. Humans have the tendency to be as wasteful as we can be. 8 lanes? Traffic will be just as jammed in a short time. So fuck it, let's build 16 lanes. Same shit. But if the traffic jam is so bad that it's making your life difficult, you'll build that teleportation with the highest urgency!

There is essentially no downside to overt AB, which is why the community has embraced it. For *covert* AB things are different. I don't know the technical details well, but I understand covert AB incentivizes mining extremely small blocks, empty even. That's a serious drag on the network as it limits the total capacity. Thankfully SegWit limits the possibility of using covert AB, if not eliminate it altogether.

Are you so insecure that you are desperately looking for a new God/Prophet to worship? 
See, the rest of us have moved on and understood the game theoretical implications of Bitcoin better than Satoshi, at least of his understanding when he was still active. I'm sure he now agrees with off-chain scaling, if he's still around and hiding. And the reality is that the Bitcoin network will require essentially a "healthy" backlog of unconfirmed txs to keep the miners honest and mining for the benefit of the system. There's a paper that discusses this, but I'm sure linking it to you would be pointless as
*"That's not what Satoshi said!!!"*

Don't believe people who throw out random coins as "better alternatives". The truth is that no coin has addressed scaling, NONE. The reason why they don't have scaling problems *now*, is because they don't have scale.

It's not. Taxation is necessary to sustain a government, and  unless you believe we could function as a civil society without *a* government (we cannot), taxes are absolutely necessary.
If you exclude people who believe that society could exist in a form similar to the current one without a government (it cannot), most people are OK with *some* level of taxation. The problem, and big source of disagreement, is where exactly is that level of taxation. Is 10% the right tax? Or is it 90%? Most likely somewhere in between.
IMO the real problem is how is tax money spent instead of how much is collected. Taxes fund wars, and most people don't agree with this. Let's say that if a country got invaded the old fashioned way, pretty much everyone would agree to a war. But when a war is waged in a country you can't even point at on a map? Most couldn't care less. So if you consider this, it feels like theft because you don't really support the war, yet your money is going to fund it.
And finally, the problem of gov employees who know their jobs are basically guaranteed for life, which makes them... not too keen on working hard, like they'd have to if their ass could be fired at any moment. This is an incentives problem, and it's not too clear how to solve it.

This is false. There's a false sense of urgency being pushed by the big blocker side, and the altcoin side to make you think you're gonna lose it all. Take a step back, zoom out of this sub and take a look at the real world.
How many users do you see daily cursing at the corner store owner because the fees are too high? How many grannies are having annoying conversations with their trusted banker on what the hell are cryptos? How many conversations did you overhear between two random people on the street saying they are annoyed as fuck they couldn't pay with Bitcoin, but luckily the merchant accepted *insert random shitcoin* and so they paid with it instead of Bitcoin? How many merchants do you see with the "bitcoin accepted" sign on their front door?
If you do this exercise you'll quickly realise that the world is in not rush to use cryptos on a daily basis. The urgency is a false narrative pushed by those with a vested interest in large blocks. It lives and thrives online, and dies very quickly in the real world.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:04:55
Yes, your example is quite fitting - Red tape for small Vs big companies. Now the decentralisation part is where it gets more tricky... The argument goes that if thousands of companies would run full nodes, it would still be decentralised, which is true, so no problems. But you may have seen that central banks are starting to worry about Bitcoin. And if central banks don't, ordinary banks are starting to. All over the world. This is an important point... Because if only large companies can afford to run nodes, at the stroke of a pen, it's illegal for a Co to run a full node, say in the US. At that point, governments all over the world will happily follow, to preserve the banking industry. Next thing you know, there are no more full nodes validating the txs, and bitcoin is as good as dead. To survive, full Bitcoin nodes must be as cheap to run as possible, so individuals can run them. Then it become absolutely impossible for any government to kill it. May sound paranoid, and perhaps it really is, but better safe than sorry is the attitude of the small blocks community.
Just as an aside, if companies were the only ones running nodes, they would charge the cost of it into their services, this hiding the fee, much like it happens with credit cards.
Also, I'm laughing at the other response you got, which is clearly from a big blocker, and who obviously doesn't understand very much about business and/or economics. But I'm sure you can see that yourself, his reply is devoid of any arguments lol

It boggles my mind how you cannot see the implictions of your own words... if standard users cannot run their own nodes, that's centralization! Might as well use fiat.


Such a naive view... wish it was true. "US bans miners"... BOOM, no miners in the US. And do you think other countries, where people are starting to wake up to the threats posed by cryptos on central banks, would not be all too happy to follow suit??? Dream on. 
We need individuals be able to run full nodes, or bitcoin is as good as dead.


Perfectly fine... we're nowhere near critical adoption, regardless of how much you want to convince yourself. Also LN is being developed fast, and major businesses are slowly coming on board with SegWit, which will provide relief for everybody. Coinbase just announced they are hiring people to do it.

But remember that timing the market is a suckers game, and aside from the initial rise from that ~0.06BTC low, BCH seems to be in a negative trend. So more likely to lose than to gain.

You admit to not reading the whole article, and yet you think it's OK to comment. You don't really understand what's going on, that much is clear from your post, and yet you think you're entitled to voicing your opinion. So this noise you're producing, because this is nothing but noise, gets on display for noobs to read and confuse themselves.
Repeat after me: 


No, I'm not going to explain why this is true. It is you who has to educate yourself on all these topics **before** starting to comment on issues you're not competent on. If you don't understand why that is true it just shows you're not competent. Which means nobody is dismissing "Satoshi's wisdom", rather it was found to be inapplicable. Full nodes are the "necessary evil" replacing Satoshi's SPVs, and yes, it is fundamental that those nodes are as sufficiently cheap that running one becomes an everyday thing.
Tell me something. Do you really think that a random amateur like yourself can come into a most technical field and start lecturing people? Do you really believe the coders working on this didn't think of ways to implement SPVs as Satoshi wanted, only for you to come up and enlighten everyone of what should be done? That nobody thought of it before you made your appearance? Where is this fucking arrogance coming from? I suspect that being treated as clients in colleges raises one's entitlement to farcical levels by slowly pushing one's head up one's ass.

True, some bugs may slip through the cracks, but even then it was found. You mentioned a backdoor, which would need a bigger piece of code, not just missing something. So easier to detect. And keep in mind not just everyone can touch the consensus part of the code, that's delicate as it gets.
No system is perfect, and a bounty would likely help. But keep in mind this bug went unnoticed by the good and the bad guys alike. You can bet your ass that if malicious actors were to spot it, they'd have exploited it. That they didn't, means it was a pretty obscure bug. (All the more props to the dev who found it...) So even a bounty might not help... 
Besides, the real problem with a bounty is who's gonna put up the money? Bitcoin has no owner or CEO. Who's gonna pay? Maybe some companies could, but it's a big ask for company in a nascent industry. And the big ones, on the other hand, are often more like malicious actors than anything else. And have often proved themselves greedy. Bitcoin doesn't have (fake)Satoshi to pay for bounties and patents.

You are missing the point of the scaling problem... no coin has the same scale as Bitcoin, no matter what they might tell you. Check out the average block sizes. (ETH is second, and they also have problems on scaling, but everyone has Vitalik as Supreme Leader, so they'll do whatever Vitalik says.) Litecoin would have the exact same problems as Bitcoin, if it had scale. Instead, (part of) the solution might be having Litecoin as a sidechain to Bitcoin. Together with LN and atomic swaps.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:04:44
It depends...
If they pay the txs fees themselves, the incentive is giant... pay less, so make more money. Bitstamp, Gemini and GDAX all pay the txs fees. Don't know about the others, but probably others do as well.
If they don't pay the fees, they risk their customers taking their business elsewhere and/or their anger.
So yeah, there's some incentive.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:40:18
It's pretty pointless to try to determine an adequate block size when the system is not even fully developed. I'm referring to L2 solutions, like LN, of course. Once LN is deployed and widely adopted, we will have a decent understanding of the space requirements for the blockchain. Then we can reassess. 
But make no mistake, on chain fees are very unlikely to be part of that equation. The reason is simple: With more on-chain capacity, more and more people will be tempted to just send their txs on-chain. So guess what? You're back at square one with high on-chain fees, but now with a much bigger blockchain. Instead, high fees will incentivise people to transact off-chain, which is a good thing as it reduces blockchain bloat.
Block will grow, just not recklessly, and not because "*ON-CHAIN FEES ARE HAAAAIIIIII!!!!!*"
Edit: On-chain fees will be part of the equation, but I suspect only indirectly. My guess is it'll be much more like "What's an acceptable time to confirm/settle a txs?", and this will have an effect on fees.

Nice try kiddo, but it's wrong. You've got it upside down. If miners change rules, their blocks will get rejected by the full nodes, so miners won't get their coinbase reward. Well, they will, just not in Bitcoin... They can then sell that altcoin to you and your chums who don't get how Bitcoin works. 
And thankfully we have a real life example of how little power in determining the rules miners have, S2X with &gt;90% of miners supporting it. Did it happen? Fuck no.

What you accept and not accept is irrelevant, but at least try to stick to the conversation/argument. Where did you see me saying that any coin will have a monopoly??? I was talking about the s-curve and exploding adoption, and how your idea of on-chain scaling is flawed. What monopoly?
Hint: Before you answer, you may wanna thing carefully what are we talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:06:00
More generally, search for "off chain scaling". 
Certainly the LN, but look also at sidechains and atomic swaps - Say using Litecoin for small payments and Bitcoin for big payments. Check out RSK - Rootstock... adds smart contract capabilities, is pegged to Bitcoin, has the same security since it's secured by the same miners, and it's MUCH faster and cheaper than either BTC or BCH on chain. Then check out OpenDime, a totally marvelous idea, basically a Bitcoin piggy bank.

Every buys is matched by a seller, or there is no txs to begin with. So yes, every long is matched by a short.
To understand the price changes in **any** market, you need to understand the idea of *order book* and that of *market makers*. Simplified, the order book tells you how much stuff you can buy/sell, and at what price. The *market makers* are the ones advertising their buying/selling on the order book. You, as the buyer, are a *market taker* - You look at the prevailing price, and if you like it, you buy or sell.  
Now... let's say there are just 3 people willing to sell. They advertise as follows:
1. 2 contract 
2. 1 contract 
3. 4 contracts 
And let's say you wanna buy some futures. What is the "prevailing market price" if you buy 1/2/3/4/5/6/... contracts? Starting with the current price of $15k, the price changes as
* 1 contract: Price $15k (because you can buy the next contract for $15k)
* 2 contracts: Price $15.5k (because there's nothing more to buy @ $15K, and the next will cost you $15.5k)
* 3 contracts: Price $16k (nothing left to buy for less than $16k)
* 4-6 contracts: Price $16k
* 7 contracts: No more market/no more price
Hope that makes some sense.

You are also confusing ability to handle scale vs "scale utilization". Of course there's not many people using it, just like all of crypto is not used by very many. But as is LN can handle way more txs than PayPal. People will slowly start using it, and it will be ready.

BCash only increased the block size. This means that yes, now it can take more transactions per second and lower fees. But that's not "scaling", that's a temporary relief at best, aka kicking the can down the road. And you cannot reach true global scale by increasing the block size, you really cannot. If you start doing some maths, just VISA scale requires 1GB blocks, and that's for ~2,000txs/sec. If you start assuming ~1bn users, each making one txs/day, that's ~11,000txs/sec, so ~5.5x as much! And that's in the best case scenario of uniform spending. What if you have 50,000txs/sec for a few hrs a day?
Basically this means you've got to add 5GB+ to the blockchain every 10min. And this needs to be transmitted (down AND up), validated and saved in a "short" time, short compared to the arrival of the next block. basically it has to happen in less than 2min!
And we are not even talking 3bn users, making 5txs/day...


The same problem you have with Bitcoin now - Blocks full, fees high.
If you spend some time thinking about the blockchain, you come to the inevitable conclusion that for a safe and fucking antifragile network, the **on-chain** fees HAVE to be high. It's not easy to see, and there's a lot to understand, but trust me people are not insisting on small blocks because we love high fees, or because we are Blockstream shills, as the other sub would have it. Truth is, scaling blockchains is a **HARD** problem, it really is.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:15:02
Create noise and confusion. Spread FUD, if you want.
The longer answer is they disagree with the Bitcoin prevailing approach to scale, i.e. off chain, and they have a sub where they hard core promote an altcoin, Bitcoin Cash/BCash/BCH as *the true* Bitcoin. This is based on their interpretation of the white paper and "Satoshi's vision". In practice, they are just very salty things didn't go their way, and now want to take the name, Bitcoin, with them.

Nobody knows... and the BlackBerry analogy is a flawed one.
Don't believe people who throw out random coins as "better alternatives". The truth is that no coin has addressed scaling, NONE. The reason why they don't have scaling problems *now*, is because they don't have scale.
If you take something like BCH with their mighty big blocks... ~130 txs per block, on average. That's no scale. Also, no shit txs fees are cheap, there's no demand for block space! And finally something very few big blockers are willing to admit, if they actually understand it... [tx fees dirty little secret](

You are mixing BTC and BCH as if they were the same thing, they are not. The reason it's never been done on BTC is because there was never enough hash power to do it. (Here I'm assuming that all the mining pools are independent and would not collude. Might not be true, and in the future such an attack may happen, but I don't want to start a conspiracy war.) So all the available hash power was busy mining BTC, instead of attacking it. For BCH, on the other hand, the situation is completely different.
The current hash power on BCH is ~15% of the total hash power, with a price of ~0.2BTC. When the price was ~0.1BTC, it was not uncommon to see ~5% of the hash power behind BCH. It is reasonable to expect that this will happen again, if the price goes back to ~0.1BTC. At that point, a 51% attack is pretty trivial for any larger pool. And given that one of the pools was, at least for some time, signaling "Fuck Bitcoin Cash" in their blocks, it doesn't really inspire too much confidence for BCH.
On a different note, when you broadcast and rbf txs, this is opt-in so you are explicitly saying "Watch out, I might double spend this". So the merchant will know this. And it remains to be seen how many people lost money as a result of rbf double spends. Erik Voorhees, on the other hand, openly admitted to losing money on 0-conf txs in BTC, and yet he argued to retain 0-conf txs. (I actually agree with him, merchants can decide whatever they want, take the risk or not.) Are rbf double spends really that worse than 0-conf? Please show me some numbers, and I'll happily accept the outcome.

The current limit for ETH is about 15txs/s, which is certainly higher than BTC, no one is claiming otherwise, but it's also  pretty low, if you want to compete with VISA. ETH has *the exact same problem* BTC has. Or rather, it will have the same problem once they reach capacity. With all the kittens going crazy, might be sooner rather than later. Let's see how that goes.
How about you get a bit more educated and read the article I posted above, about ETH scaling? You know, instead of talking shit. [Here]( for your reading and educational pleasure.

Re-read my write up... at the bottom I mention "hedgers" as on of the categories of users. Historically, futures have been introduced for hedgers, but then speculators always follow through.
People often think that speculators are intrinsically bad, but that's not the case. Without speculators, we'd have years with grain shortages, and years with grain rotting in the storages. It's tricky to see why, but in practice an active futures market reduces the volatility a lot. Which is one of the key issues people have with bitcoin now, it's too volatile.

This bear market is absolutely beautiful, and the main reason for me is that it's wildly punishing some of the players, especially the malicious ones.

Roger needs to launch yet another scam, a bitcoin(,)com ICO, to keep funding his anti-bitcoin campaign. And the same is for other lunatics like CSW/Calvin Ayre/various useful idiots from the bcash camp.

In addition, it will be for larger LN hubs who will charge some fees to stake the capital. And since the cost of entry will be pretty low, I plan on running a LN hub, the competition will be pretty stiff and the txs costs pretty low. All of this is further true because one channel allows for thousands of txs, if they go in both directions.


*Some* vendors and *some* users are switching to BCash indeed. And the main reason is because of the giant effort by Roger&amp;Co to push for it. Which includes shitting on BTC, in the form of FUD and other such BS.

Disagree... Bitcoin does not need anymore energy to scale. Actually, you could secure the network with 10,000 GPU miners, assuming no one has ASICS. People get into mining because it's profitable, not because more mining is required to support higher tx count. And yes, once people do get involved with ASICS, this makes the network more and more secure. Which then feeds a feedback loop. But that's beyond the point here.

I don't know who claims that fees should, in general, be high. But I feel pretty confident in saying that they are a non-representative minority. If that was true, there'd be no reason to develop off chain solutions... We already have high fees!
Think about it, if we want high fees, we already have them, so why waste energy with writing complex L2 solutions? Doesn't make any sense.
Clearly the answer is different. High fees will remain for on-chain txs, and without going into detail I have very recently convinced myself that's good. (Essentially to incentivize miners once the block reward becomes small. But I don't want to start a discussion on this, feel free to disagree.) However, that doesn't mean txs fees should be high off chain. Actually, we already have L2 solutions for BTC txs that have exactly 0 fees for an arbitrary amount of BTC. Example, OpenDime, the BTC piggy bank. (Google it if you don't know it, it's awesome.)
LN is the clear practical solution to this. Once the system is in full swing, high txs fees will obviously be a thing of the past. And trust me when I tell you that absolutely everyone will be happy about it. Except for Roger Ver and his most staunch supporters, that is.

Ahhh... was waiting for a Bitmain shill. How are doing `redditor for 1 week`?
Nothing in my comment is true?


I think that's as true as it gets. Plenty of documents out there to confirm, even reporting your boss (Jihan) was furious as they now have to reveal Q2 results, which were, how should we put this, less then stellar?


Conditional statement, not expressing certainty. It certainly doesn't mean "it's bankrupt", but it does mean that if things don't recover for Bitmain, it **may** go bankrupt. Again, note the key word 'may' expressing uncertainty.
Given the above, 


this is 100% correct. 
The comments after that just pick on what is in the slides. 


absolutely means nothing is being produced now. "Soon", is not "now. So again, the statement is correct. 


Is this not true? If you claim this is not true, you have clearly no idea of chip design, and design more generally. 
A question for you... why didn't they show a video of a working prototype hashing away at 42J/TH?
So it would seem that my comment is pretty spot on. Tell your boss (Jihan) that we've learned to spot through the bullshit. Including shills, especially the sub-par ones like you. Guess the bear market is punishing him hard enough with bcash, and he can't afford top notch shills?

Incorrect. S2X could bring the blocks to 8MB, because SegWit can bring them to 4MB in some pathological cases.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:47:41
They have SegWit enabled, which reduces the txs fees, which they pay. And, of course, they probably bundle transfers so they pay less fees.

No. Won't get any political traction - People investing $100m's won't be happy to have their hardware bricked. Perhaps more importantly, opens up an obvious attack vector on Bitcoin, the legacy chain on PoW. You can bet every last coin you've got that the legacy chain will not only survive, but it will also become THE Bitcoin. 
* Miners **across the world** would support it - They want to recover the investment
* Businesses would support it - Don't want to perform software upgrades
* Many users would also stick with the legacy chain
Also, to put things in perspective, no one ever talks about the electricity cost of running Google server farms. Or Facebook. Or any other giant tech company. A PoW change can be done, IMO, if governments around the world crack down on energy consumption, but not otherwise.

No, I'm not going to explain it, it's a big task and it would take more than just a post. 1MB blocks were never going to be enough, and everybody knows that.

If word gets out Jihan/Calvin/CSV/Roger are liquidating, and they collectively have ~2m bcash, those bids will evaporate before you can say "bcash is a scam".

Caution is advised... Bitmain is dealing with a broken IPO, and possible bankruptcy if that doesn't work out. They have all the incentives to sugar coat announcements. 
Note how:
* Soon to be mass produced
means there's nothing being produced right now. ~~Also, TMSC announced they are abandoning their 7nm tech plans... who will produce for Bitmain?~~
* Lab tests
... are very often conducted with simulations. Did they show a video of a working 7nm miner? Nope. Because they don't have a working piece of hardware?

Why I didn't buy? I'd like to find good reasons why, but the truth is I thought it was just "magic internet money", to sell to the first fool happy to pay ~$10 for one. Kept reading about it, and always how someone offloaded a USB stick with BTC to someone else for (then) crazy amounts of money. Then forgot about it until 2014.

Depends on what you consider as risk, and what is the acceptable level of risk for you.
Receiving Bitcoin is straightforward, get wallet, give client address, done. You should consider getting a hardware wallet for this, then this is pretty much as risk free as it gets. Question is what do you want to do with the Bitcoin? If hodling, you're done. But I suspect that's not what you want.
If you want to convert to fiat, then you could do this in different ways, and they will generally involve a third party. Say register with an exchange, sell the coins yourself, and then transfer the cash to your bank account. This will likely require talking to your bank and the exchange to make them aware of what's going on. And you'll have the paperwork to confirm everything.
Simpler, but more expensive, register with a payment processor, like Coinbase, and send the invoice from CB. They will automatically convert to fiat, and I think even transfer to your bank account. Again, talk to both to avoid problems and/or delays.

That's not really correct. What you need is incoming capacity, channels which are "empty" on your end but with money staked on the other end.
Let's say you open 10 channels for 0.1BTC total, but others open 100 channels for 1.5BTC total, you can receive up to 1.5BTC.


If you use lnd rather than clightning, lightningconductor will open income capacity of you open it with them.
Over time, though, if you leave your node up and running consistently, people will open channels towards you. Happened to me, so now I have inbound capacity. Key here is a stable node, no one wants to open channels with a node that is online only when the sun shines...


Not really. It's entirely up to you. You can spin up your own node, but then you'll need to build the online handling of the payments. Build a website, basically. On the plus side, you don't need to pay the processor and people will be opening channels towards you.
Edit: Forgot to mention BTCPayServer! Will handle the online part, so you don't have to build a full website. Think of it as the open source version of BitPay, with a LN node included.

Don't fall prey to the altcoin mania, especially if you plan to hodl some of the coins. If you really cannot avoid alts, ask yourself if it has been around for at least 5 years. You'll be basically left with LTC. Add XMR (Monero) as a privacy coin to the mix, and that's pretty much it - By far and large Bitcoin, some LTC and some XMR. Or just stick with Bitcoin.

Why now is easy to answer - Bitmain is almost underwater having the mother of all bcash bags losing them ~$400m they cannot offload, approximately ~$1bn of stock they cannot sell, and almost no bitcoin left to support the operation. (Less than 5,000 BTC, which is a lot for you and me, but since they had several 10,000s, it's almost chump change at this point.) 
Bitmain is going underwater fast, and they need every last bit of cash they can get their hands on. AB helps.

You can just recompile whilst still running the node. Once you have the binaries, just stop the deamon, sudo make install, and restart the deamon. Should be totally painless, if you remember the compile config that worked for you.

Blockchains need a certain set of rules to agree upon in order the reach *consensus*. Can these rules be changed? Yes. How? By forking.
The short answer to your question is that a hard fork implements rules that are **not compatible** with the current set of rules, whereas a soft fork will implement some new rules that **are compatible** with the current ones.
Two very actual examples, increasing the block size and SegWit. Currently, all the full (validating) nodes will check every block they receive to see if it's smaller than 1MB. If you were to submit a 1.5MB block, it would get rejected. So if you want to increase the block size, you need to hard fork. If, however, you wanted to *decrease* the block size, you could simply soft fork. Let's say the new block size you wanted was 0.5MB. This creates no problems as the old full nodes would check for &lt;1MB, which would be automatically satisfied.
SegWit, which was successfully activated in Aug, was an example of a soft fork. For the longest time people thought it could only be done as a hard fork, but then it was discovered it could be done as a soft fork as well, and that's how it was activated.
There are many reasons to avoid hard forks, but you should be able to see that a hard fork requires **absolutely everyone** on the network to upgrade, or be left behind. In a soft fork, the network keeps going and people can opt-in when/if they choose to do so. (This is just the tip of the iceberg, hard forks pose other challenges. But that's another story. It doesn't mean we can never hard fork, but the prevalent attitude is that we should hard fork as little as possible.)

I'm sure you can see how this is flawed.


This is based on belief, so hardly any merit in this. I believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster... does it mean it's real?
Truth is, if txs become cheap AND price fluctuations are dramatically reduced, Starbucks and the others will become incentivised to use Bitcoin. The incentive being profit, since every plastic swipe payment costs them a few %. Sure, they pass the cost to the customer, but they could decrease costs 1% and pocket the remaining 1%. And customers would be very happy to pay a few sat in txs fee.
You'll need to rethink the economics of Bitcoin a bit better, and reform your beliefs.

There was never a split, this is false propaganda pushed by Roger Ver and all the channels he controls, including bitcoin(dot)com. Bitcoin keeps going strong, and if you use software from 2013, it will keep working perfectly... on the Bitcoin network. 
BCash forked off and created an altcoin. This is totally fine, you are free to fork any coin you want, but this is **not** in any way "one of the two forks of Bitcoin". BCH has different consensus rules, including the diff adjustment algo and more. It's an altcoin that is pushing falsehoods like "It's the real Bitcoin". And if you are a genuine noob, you fell for it as you seem to be believing at least some of it.
Also, BCH does not follow the WP, there are many aspects of it which diverge. For one, Satoshi did not say "let me invent something which is cheaper than PayPal", he wanted a **decentralized** system (that's what P2P means), and with large blocks the end state is inevitable centralization. 
No, BCash is not Bitcoin. There was no "split" one year ago, only the creation of an altcoin called BCash, or Bitcoin Cash if you really want. And BCash doesn't follow the white paper any more or less than all the other altcoins out there do - It **ALL** started with that white paper.

Yes. This can be done various ways. Let's say I owe you money - I can open a channel with you and send you the money. Or you can use a submarine swap for on-chain/off-chain swaps.

Many people smoke and don't die, doesn't make it non-risky.
Point is, sure, today many merchants accept 0-conf because why not. But as bitcoin grows in adoption, you can bet people will start to attempt more double spends, and some merchants will most definitely feel the heat of that. That's why we keep saying it's not safe, don't do it. 


Servers to broadcast txs? You mean a... full node? Costs very little to set one up.

If there was a unique way to determine what is the "time ordering" of txs in a 0-conf setting, we would not need PoW. Problem is, txs propagate through the network differently and for some nodes the double spend will be "first" in the queue, and for others it will be "second". 
Fundamental laws of physics are a bitch. Special relativity, in particular.


Cannot build a *trustless* system on what people should do. And you can't ask them nicely to do it. Miners will do exactly what is best for themselves, and if mining the double spend is more profitable, say because of a higher fee, that's what they will do.


See problem with special relativity I mentioned above.


I addressed a few points already. Some more, Satoshi referred to the Bitcoin network, which has PoW as key part, as a "time stamping server". That's because it is exactly what the network does, it puts a time stamp on every txs so it becomes clear for everyone which txs came first. So we all agree. Consensus. Without PoW it is impossible (or at least unknown how) to provide this time stamping with the same level of security/confidence.
Hope that's a bit more clear.

The low fees will come as well, yes, through LN and other off chain solutions, but low fees are not the reason why we need Bitcoin.

You tell me. Let's start with king shitcoin ETH. A year is OK? Last year in Aug was trading between 0.068 and 0.09. Now it's 0.04. Only if you bought early 2017 you're now up. Because if you bought in 2016 you're still up, yes, but you had to endure a looooong period of pain. And the trend is not looking good either. If you bought ETH in the last year, you're actually LUCKY if you're down 50%, the top was trading ~0.15.
BCash? If you bought one year ago you're probably up in BTC terms. If you bought in Oct/early Nov, you're up. But if you bought at any other time, you're down. You bought in mid November? You've got two assholes now. Bought three months ago? Down 50%.
Pretty much every alt is telling you the same story. If you time it right, you got off ahead. But hodling only? The trend is pretty clear. And since we're talking alts, you may wanna check what happened to the top 10 alts from 2013. Give it a go.

The IPO deck only show their results up to Q1 2018, when things were pretty rosy. The sales were still OK and their giant bag of bcash was a lot less heavy. They also said they had various big name investors in the pre-IPO.
If you look at Q2 results, they have a few $100m paper loss from bcash, which they cannot move as that would destroy the market because of extremely low liquidity. They have ~$1bn of unsold stock of old miners, think they don't even have S9s on stock, but the much older S7s. Then they burned a ton of money on failed 10nm chip design, three rounds of it I think. YOu also have three teams left the Co and one of them, the chip designers, are looking for funding to compete with them. And all those pre-IPO investors? One by one came out and said they didn't invest.
The IPO is, basically, Jihan looking for clueless people to offload his bcash bags to.
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:20:24
Add to this mix of news they've been giving out coupons to redeem against S9 purchases, selling them at ~50% of cost apparently, this makes those BCash bags heavier by the fucking day.

Of course it does. Mining means maintaining warehouses of hardware and people running them. This is costly.

Nice cherry picking... if you play with [this estimator]( you'll quickly see that the $5 claim is BS. Yes, the fee in the best case is $5, but that best case involves
* Country with relatively good connections
* Small amount of money (LESS than $1,000)
* Payment done online and deposited to bank account
Just for fun, I've used the above link on a bunch of countries... $1,000 sent to Ecuador costs $19 if you do it via bank, in which case it takes **4 days**. If you do it via credit/debit card, it's $36. Oh, and WU also warns you that on a cc payment you may be charged a cash advance fee.
So much for $5. But feel free to click around yourself, in case you want to make your argument about $5 fees stronger.


First sign that you don't actually know what you're talking about as you are unlikely to be aware between Ripple Labs and Ripple (XRP) the crypto. Long story short, Ripple Labs, which has been making all those announcements about international remittances, **does not use XRP** for those remittances. Instead they have their own protocols, say xRapid, to handle those remittances. Of course that's very welcome competition, but what exactly will come out of that is yet to be seen.
And no, Ripple Labs does not have the valuation you think it has. That's the market cap of the coin, which is ridiculous, and most of the coins are held by executives of the company.


More evidence you don't know what you're talking about. This *was* true during period of high network stress (e.g. December), and **will be** true again once adoption rises. Currently, and for most of Bitcoin's existence, this was absolutely false. [Here]( spend some time understanding these graphs and then you can draw your own conclusion as to how much a txs would cost you to have it confirmed in a few hrs. Hint: It's less than $1.
Should also be noted that this applies to **on-chain** txs ONLY. LN txs are on another planet when it comes to fees.


I love language, it reveals much more about people's thought processes than they would ever be willing to admit. This is yet more proof that you have no idea what you're talking about, or very vague anyway. Who, in your mind, is "them"? Who qualifies as "them"? There is no company/entity that does the processing, it's the network that does that. You should really try to understand this better before engaging in conversations about it.


Of course they are. If cc fees were 0, and charge backs were non-existent, consumer prices would be lower due to competition. You cut a cost, prices come down... that's right there and then. If you mean it wouldn't happen overnight, that's another story, but prices would be lower, just like you can find outlets that will give a discount if you pay with cash.


Again misguided comment re fees. But you should also consider that vendors get their cc payments, what, 60 days later? In any event, this is a real limitation, not denying that,  especially once the network will run at capacity. The good thing is, LN is spreading like wildfire. Watch [this video]( to witness the future of merchants waiting a few sec and customers paying non-existent fees.


Here we go again with your displays of ignorance. There is no "escrow with the watchtower"... if you really want to talk about escrow, it's an escrow that does not involve a third party, and which both parties in a channel can claim money from whenever they want. So no escrowing, really. The watchtowers will exist as additional guarantee for those users that cannot be online at all times. Again, learn about stuff before talking about it.
And as you could conclude from what I said above, (online) merchants will be very happy to use LN as it gives them their funds **immediately and with no charge backs**. The latter is especially important for online merchants.


Maybe. Or maybe I generally prefer cash back to travel cookie points. 


I don't care why the fee is what it is, I only care what the fee is. And I have to pay it.


Third time you make a similar claim, amply debunked above.


Ahh... the ignorant who don't know what they're talking about and yet feel like they have strong argument to discuss. And as it is often the case, hiding behind *scientism* making request to provide  


Fine, I'll do some of the dirty work for you.. with real life businesses, no "scientific studies"
* [BitPesa]( working in Africa (4 countries and expanding) to facilitate the economy
* [An article on Bitcoin in Africa]( - Yes, it does mention the speculative part, but also touches upon BitPesa
* Myself, who hired a dev and paid him in Bitcoin to do some work for me (engagement still ongoing, btw)
* [Venezuelans turning to Bitcoin]( for daily transactions (Yes, it's still small... but as I said, it's *increasingly being used*)
* [Sudan, Kenya and South Africa have seen a surge of Bitcoin use in the past year](
* And of course, then [there's Japan]( where people are just going mad over Bitcoin
* ...
There's more, it's just scattered all over and I don't keep track of every single piece of news.


This rhetoric is old and stinks of old. We've been listening to this kind of preachings every single time Bitcoin crashed. And yet, here we are, at $9k... and those who sold at, say, $200, are bloody regretting it. 
But you're right, [don't buy bitcoin, you know it's gonna crash](


Oh... yes.. of course!!! The grand finale, where you show your full colors: A nocoiner! I guess you were mighty giddy when Bitcoin went from $19k to $6k, weren't you? I'm surprised you didn't mention baby brains.
Btw, you are also again displaying a total ignorance about Bitcoin and its workings. Read [this]( and try to understand why Bitcoin is an extremely shitty medium for  underground/illegal activity. Here's an idea for you - It's a *public* ledger. Then it shouldn't be too much of a surprise that [less than 1% of Bitcoin transactions are used for illicit activities](
The best, and most widespread, means to commit all sorts of illicit activities? It's cash... and the reason why [people want to kill the $100 bill]( Ban the USD???

It's not wrong, you just need to refine it a bit. Winter 2017 was the opportune moment when Roger was crazy going out on national TV parroting "slow, expensive, unreliable" vs "fast, cheap, reliable". It was a key moment in the BCash attack, so it was imperative to spam as much as possible. I don't have a link to the tx, but someone dug up a txs which was moved from the block it was mined and then every block, until there was nothing left, it was all consumed in fees. Let's try to guess who that might have been...

Yes, Satoshi today would most certainly go for an ASIC friendly hash function. The reason is simple, network security. 
Anytime you build something that is "ASIC resistant", in quotes because that's something that just doesn't exist, you expose the chain to a botnet attack. A script kiddie controlling thousands of machines around the world could seriously compromise the network, and ultimately the trust in it. Not acceptable.
This is the reason why even hard core proponents of a PoW change, say Luke-jr, want to change to something else that is ASIC friendly. Now that crypto is in the spotlight, Bitmain will not be a super power anymore. At least not the only one.

Pathetic BCash narrative. Between "P2P" and "cash" the key part is "P2P", not the "cash". We had eCash before, which got shut down because it was centralized. So if you kill the P2P, you'll kill the "cash" as well.
As for the digital signatures, you obviously need to make the additional comment "(non-seggregated)" because you already know the answer otherwise. But I'll take the bait, please show me where, in the white paper, it is **explicitly** stated that the signatures must not be segregated. I'll go get a coffee, I'm confident you can show me this info in a short time, since you seem pretty confident about the content of the white paper. 
Let's agree one thing. If you can't show me this section of the white paper that explicitly forbids segregating signatures, we'll conclude you're full of shit, deal?

You can write whatever you want, it doesn't matter. The consensus rules of Bitcoin are still in place, and if you spin up software from 2013, you'll end up on the Bitcoin network. You can send SegWit txs to those nodes and more. 
There is perfect continuity of consensus rules in Bitcoin. BCash breaks the consensus rules.

1 + 2: It is a false e narrative that the task to solve is complex. In reality the basic operation that is happening in mining, hashing, is extremely simple and you could do it by hand, but the "answer" must satisfy certain condition. And the condition is such that it ensures block production must happen, on average, every 10min. And because of the nature of the problem, you have no other choice but trying randomly until you get to an answer that satisfies the condition. 
You can think of a 100 sided die and you "win" if you roll 1. Rolling the die is not complex nor difficult, but it will take you some time before you roll that 1. Mining is very similar, except the die will have trillions of sides. And yes, this has all been encoded into the protocol.
3: Yes, it's called a fork. But by nature of the system, decentralization, this is very difficult because it requires essentially everyone to agree to the change, and it's pretty much impossible for everyone to agree to anything. And so some aspects of it are absolutely immutable, like the 21m cap. Other parts can and will be changed when required. 
Last comment, there are some changes that can be implemented without big disruptions and require only miners to "upgrade". These are "soft forks" and are the preferred way to implement new changes as it causes minimal disruption (miners), but users and businesses are unaffected. If they want to use the new features, they upgrade, but they don't have to. A perfect example of this is SegWit.

You're spot on. It's totally fine for now, but I expect this to go up eventually. Not so much for the electricity, but to cover the costs to open/close channels.

If you did, pls tell me which is your shop so I can tell my salespeople to avoid you like the plague. Or short you, if you are publicly traded.
A LN hub is absolutely nothing like any financial institution, nothing like it at all. For one, the barrier to entry are so low there will be countless nodes, making any regulation virtually impossible to enforce. You can regulate behemots, not nimble small players. Also there is no custodianship of funds in LN, a not irrelevant aspect. Which means there is no AML/KYC, and there couldn't be, because tanks to onion routing there is no way for me to know who is the original sender. And, of course, routing around any hub that potentially does try to enforce any kind of AML/KYC.
The mis-information being spread by BCash shills is unbelievable. But the funny thing is that you are shooting yourself in the foot in the process. It becomes extremely easy to dismantle the bogus claims after a while, they are always the same.

If hashrate is going up it only means the block reward is still larger than the cost to mine bitcoin. 
At the current price, ~$8,100, the block reward is enough to support ~6GW of electricity consumption, if the average cost of electricity is ~$0.10 per kWhr. (Change the cost to get a different answer.) That's a lot of electricity... and until we get there, hashrate will keep rising. And if the price goes up... you do the math.

There's a general confusion about "banks". Banks will do business in whatever currency is most profitable, and if that happens to be bitcoin, they will happily jump on board. They will adapt their business models, but they aren't going away, that you can be sure of. IMO, the killer feature of bitcoin is not that it will kill banks, it won't, but it will weaken the industry, which is good. At some point banks will be more like a cottage industry than a giant behemot no one can touch. And that's good for everyone.

OK, at this point I'm just gonna say you're fucking stupid, and nothing else. I gave you the benefit of the doubt and tried explaining again, but now I'll claim you're fucking stupid.
THE fundamental concept behind special relativity is that every signal travels at a finite speed, which applies to the communication over cables. In this case it's specifically the speed of light in cables, which is lower than in vacuum. This means that it will take different times for a signal to reach different nodes, and since the paths are random, you will have different paths for different txs. So different times of arrival because the speed of propagation is finite.
Fucking stupid.

The BCash people will tell you that they got rid of RBF precisely because they want "0-conf to be safe". It's not, regardless. And RBF addresses other problems.
The thing is, if it's profitable to do, it will become widespread. All you need is one coder/group of coders to put together a wallet that attempts double spends at every txs. Let's say your success rate is 15%. Well, that's gives you a nice discount on everything you buy!
But guess what? Merchants won't be stupid for ever and will do one of two things - Stop accepting crypto payments, or raise prices to compensate the double spend attempts. Pick your poison.

@_date: 2018-08-20 13:37:30
I don't think you understood my response as you think you do.


A lot... because signals have to propagate over a *physical* medium. Which means that, because of special relativity, the same two txs, call them X and Y, will appear in *different order to different nodes*, including miners. So miner A will receive the two txs as X -- Y, but miner B will receive them as Y -- X. If you just say "ignore the second tx", which should we ignore, X or Y? That this is true is a direct implication of special relativity, because the signals will travel over cables with a finite speed, and an unpredictable path.
This is what PoW solves - There is no arguing about which txs is first, it is literally the one tx that first makes it into a block, ignoring re-orgs and 51%.


If we are talking about non-confirmed txs, see above. Txs that have already been confirmed are not even propagated, so of course they are ignored because they are invalid.


I did, and clarified some more above. Even honest miners that stick to the "first seen" rule will see different transactions in different order. And if you include extremely selfish miners that just miner for max profit no matter what, then they will absolutely mine the tx with higher fee. So all you need to do is double spend with a higher fee and some miners will confirm the double spend.
If you think this is just baloney and that in practice doesn't work, check doublespend.cash. It's a website tracking double spend attempts on BCash. They like to say 0-conf is safe precisely because "miners stick to first seen". Well, that's clearly not the case... look at the double spends that win out, and compare the fee. They generally have a higher fee. And sometimes they even have a lower fee!
There is enough data out there today to confirm that 0-conf is not safe. If you, as a merchant, want to accept it, do it. So long as you accept the risks.

The illusion of no cost, of a free lunch. Reality is that moving money has a real cost. Aside from the comment above, if they don't charge for your txs it simply means they are recovering the costs from the services you mentioned. Hidden costs.... Like for credit card txs - it's not free, it's just hidden in the price of the stuff you buy.


The problem is when an industry becomes so big you can't touch it. And I explained above all banks have similar costs, then it's a question of how they cover those costs. Different banks, different business models.

@_date: 2018-05-07 23:58:10


It doesn't... precisely for Bitcoin it doesn't. Well, not at this point with BCash out of the way. The reason is the incredible PoW accumulated. Assume all miners migrate, which at this point is very likely since even those who opposed SegWit and so on now have BCash, the nodes left behind are simply stuck on a dead chain. Of course, it would have to be fully coordinated with all the exchanges and other big economic nodes (miners would basically have no choice, or they wouldn't get paid), but once migrated the old nodes would be on a dead chain which cannot be resurrected.
I agree with the overall worry though, and fully support soft-forks until it's no longer possible to soft fork!

No, what is relevant is the fee in Bitcoin. This tells you that the "high fees" people cry about today were, in fact, always there, just hidden. It also allows to compare fees with BCash, and then you realise their dream of having "cheap txs" is just that, a dream. Because if the price were to skyrocket, then the fees would be just as high.


Repeat after me: *Large txs on-chain, small txs off-chain.*

No, at most some 10% of the community left. At most. Likely less though.


Again wrong... look at [this]( an analysis on tx batching. It's increasing. 
There was another one which shows that single-payment txs are now a small %, and have been declining for some time. Most of the txs are double-payment ones, but there's plenty of 10- or 50- payment txs as well.
Last comment, it's undeniable that part of the txs that used to be on Bitcoin are not on BCash... but that's ~10% of the daily txs. And these are txs, not payments. So yeah, go play with your silly toys like memo(.)cash and such, helps increase the tx count for you.

Broken argument as it assumes that the collective is **ONLY** made up of individuals who want porn, beer and McDonalds. If we only stick with people, no companies, you are completely ignoring travelers who have to exchange fiat CCY1 for fiat CCY2 every time they travel, and for every country they go to. What if they could just buy Bitcoin, and use it all over the world? The merchants on the other side would take care of the local BTC --&gt; fiat exchanges.
Or what about people helping family in far away countries? Sending money abroad, that is?

There's a lot of confusion, starting with the fact people are led to believe there's a "bitcoin side". There isn't, but TL;DR Nobody would give a rats ass about BCash, if it wasn't for their constant attacks on Bitcoin. (Which is what OP noticed.)
Longer response...
1. Large blocks seem like the obvious answer, but they carry a lot of not-so-obvious drawbacks. The key one is, large blocks lead to centralization pressures as the cost of running a full node go up. r/btc likes to cry about "*Storage is cheeeaaaaaaap!!!!*", which was never the issue. Funny thing is, the "block size" debate is not about... storage. See, told you it's counter-intuitive. The real problem is bandwidth (and latency even more specifically), and CPU (to a lesser extent). It's a long story, but for the network to be secure, it's fundamental that blocks propagate in a very short time compared to the "block time" (10min), that they be validated in a very short time and then transmitted on. All of this is to *not* favour very large miners. Big blocks do, much more than it is today. This leads to the question, if large blocks lead to centralization, which they do, so how do we scale this wonderful technology? The Bitcoin community **will not compromise** on decentralization, which makes on-chain "scaling" a no-go. Hello off-chain scaling... BCash, on the other hand, they keep saying that huge miners and server farms are how the end state looks like to them. That's not decentralization. 
2. r/bitcoin is not censored, that's idiotic propaganda. I wrote a longer response to their nonsense [here]( In short, there are rules which are being enforced. The most ironic thing is that one of the geniuses in r/btc wants to prove that there is "censorship", and then posts an image which **confirms** my points, i.e. there is no freaking censorship but moderation.
3. This is also a misguided rhetoric. Money, to be money, must **FIRST** be a store of value, before it can be a sensible medium of exchange. HODL helps accomplish this. And the LN will help the spedn part, when it's ready. (I'm not saying you should not spend your bitcoin now, just replenish your stash as you go. So spend&amp;replenish is as effective as HODL, and better. Keep in mind, very few merchants retain the coins, most will just convert to fiat immediately.) Oh, the BCash people also believe 0 confirm txs are safe, they are not, and think the SegWit breaks the chain of digital signature... which it doesn't. So it's a fair statement that they are not particularly well versed in the technical aspects of Bitcoin.
With your questions out of the way, the real point of contention has to be addressed... the continuous, incessant, repeated attacks on Bitcoin. Off the top of my head:
* "BCH is the real Bitcoin"
* CNBC Fast Money in cahoots with them (think one of the editor's wife is in a BCash fund, which also explains why they are very happy to invite Roger to talk)
* Roger going on various media shitting on Bitcoin ("Slow, expensive, unreliable" vs "fast, cheap, reliable") 
* "Bitcoin Core" (so to confuse people thinking there are "many flavours" of Bitcoin.... there aren't: There's Bitcoin, and there are forks)
*  on Twitter shilling BCash all the time!
* Controlling to and shill BCash
* bitcoin,com creating confusion by selling Bitcoin (BCH) vs Bitcoin Core (BTC)... guess what people end up buying?? (Some of this has been countered when a lawsuit threat came up)
* Roger's buddy (co-)founder of bitcoin,com going on TV saying he's sold every Bitcoin because it's doomed, back in Dec when the fees were (artificially) high
* Coordinated attack on the network (in Nov 2017) at the exact moment it was most vulnerable (when the difficulty adjustment happened) by: Dumping BTC on the market + pumping the price of BCash to entice miners to abandon Bitcoin in favour of BCash. (It failed, and must have cost a fortune!!)
* Supporting every single contentious fork that breaks the consensus rules (Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, BCash, SegWit2X, Ethereum... yes, Roger was last shitting on TV that ETH will overtake Bitcoin about two weeks ago)
* Opposing SegWit, one of the most beautiful and powerful improvements to Bitcoin, for an excessively long time thus stopping other updates
* Now that SegWit is active, very possibly working behind the scenes to stop companies from rolling it out (blockchain.info... Roger invested in it, and they have yet to roll out SegWit and are one of the biggest players)
* The BCash pump &amp; dump / insider trading when Coinbase launched it
* Pushing a false narrative about "low fees" and failing to disclose that the "high" (USD) fees are a result of Bitcoin's high price; also denying that the BCash fees (in sat/b) are actually **higher** occasionally (like in the last 24hrs) than Bitcoin's, and the only reason why the USD fees are lower is because the price is lower
* ... I'm sure there's more, maybe someone else can chime in and add more spice
The truth is Bitcoin supporters don't give a shit about BCash nor any of the other forks - Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin Diamond, ... [there's 44 of them!]( If BCash dropped the false propaganda, lies and deceit, we'd never even think about them or whatever it is that they wanna do.  So what you are seeing as the "Bitcoin side" is not the "Bitcoin side" at all, it's just the community reaction to the constant attacks perpetrated by a few prominent players in BCash, first and foremost... yes, you got it, Roger. He's a fucking scammer and he deserves to go back to jail. (You read that right... **back** to jail, he's been there in the past.)
As I said at the top, if BCash dropped the attacks, the whole thing would stop immediately. But the truth is they've got nothing without the name, and hence it's in their interest to keep pushing the false narrative and peddling shit. And this is clearly reflected in the two communities: always cherishes the tech progress + dank memes + debunking FUD about money in general (from banks and such), whereas has some cheering the BCash developments (not much as there's not much development happening), and a lot of hating Bitcoin+and spreading technically inaccurate information. 
Anyway... there's no short way to explain all of this lol Keep reading both subs, and I'm sure you'll see that for yourself.

They will try, sure... but will they succeed? Not if we can keep Bitcoin decentralized. If you run your own node, and hundreds of thousands of other people do, governments can try to force fork the network... they'll end up on a new chain on their own, mining their beloved goverbitcoin. The rest of us will stay with bitcoin.
TL;DR Run your own node.

You should consider a career as a comedian. Some comments. Just based on the subscribers, that's ~25%, nothing like 30%-40%. Then you should adjust by considering people who are subbed to both. Further adjustment when you realize most people joined in late 2017 when FOMO was running high. But perhaps most importantly, you should really consider the amount of traffic... which is at ~350k **payments**/day for Bitcoin, and ~16k **txs**/day for BCH. Not exactly apples for apples, but it's a fair statement that batching is not as widespread in BCash as it is in Bitcoin. Even if we compare txs (~200k vs ~16k) you are coming up short. I'll give you 7% in terms of economic activity. That's how much of the community left. ~7%.
BCash is a (significant) minority fork, deal with it.

When in a corner, attack ad hominem.
Bitcoin is not a global transaction medium mainly for two reasons. One, it's not yet ready to be a global transaction medium. Limited on-chain capacity is real, and building L2 solutions like LN takes time. Second, and arguably more important, money is, ultimately, a matter of trust. And trust, especially when tied to a completely new paradigm which requires different thinking that what we are all used to, takes time. People are warming up, and once they go for the door, it will be a stampede, not an orderly queue.

Right... I've recomposed myself. When was the last time you wired money internationally? I did it on a good few occasions in the past 2 years. Min fee was ~$30. On one occasion, as I was transferring a significant (for me) amount, the fee was a whopping $150. 
I trust you know the txs fees in Bitcoin are currently &lt;$1, regardless of amount. And when they rise again (which I hope happens sooner rather than later), you'll have LN payments available. The tx fees for LN are not even worth discussing.


You must be one of those who never travels. First comment, credit card transactions are never free... you don't see the tx cost because it's hidden in the price of the goods - Merchants have to cover the ~2-5% fee for every txs.
Second, when you travel abroad, unless you have a credit card specifically designed for travel, you will ALWAYS pay a txs fee. My cc will always add $2-$3 as "foreign fee".


There's much more than just Nigeria... there's tons of people in Africa who would LOVE to transact in USD, but cannot because there's no banking system. Guess what? They are increasingly using Bitcoin. 
And finally, hate it as much as you wish, countries where sanctions are being imposed will happily used a censorship resistant currency to transact with other countries under the duress of sanctions. Or with countries that don't agree with those sanctions.

That's irrelevant. CC txs cannot be double spent repeatedly and consistently since the cc issuer will come after you legally if you do it. As in, if you try to claim charge backs too often. Which is a strong deterrent.
As for the merchants, all the charge backs and fees are already priced in the final price you pay. So they know someone will try to scam them, and raise prices to account for it.
With 0-conf, in the other hand, you are telling merchants it's better than cc because of the reasons you mentioned, how there's no charge backs, and possibly more. But then a cleverly designed wallet will double spend automatically every time after a few mins, which makes the attempt to double spend absolutely effortless. Let's say your success rate is 10%, this gives you a ~10% discount on everything. And to everyone else as well, because the wallet would quickly spread. How do you think merchants would react? Either raise prices to account for double spends, or not accept crypto at all.
0-conf is not safe. If you fully understand what it means and how it works, and still want to accept it, sure, go for it. There are people who are happy to accept the risk. But for a general merchant who just wants to get paid in Bitcoin, that's not the way to go.

Yes and no. Yes because LN can scale about a factor 100, if not 1000, from today. No, because it cannot scale a factor 1,000,000. At least not in it's current form.
But that's fine. Plenty of room to grow, which gives time to build improvements. 
Even so, LN will *not be* the only solution to scale bitcoin. You cannot have bitcoin for every use case with just LN. Sidechains, like Blockstream's Liquid, will come to the rescue. Liquid, for example, is dedicated to exchanges so traders can arbitrage price differences quickly and cheaply. Other use cases will be built, as Liquid demonstrates what is possible and how this can work.
Exciting times ahead!

I'm a bit perplexed by the choice of 2-out-of-2 multisig, with the other key on your servers. I understand the security aspect, but can I do that on my local machine? I can use my own node, which is great for privacy, can I set up my second key to be on my local machine instead? This would be security and privacy, at the cost of slightly increased tx cost.

This is such a strawman, I don't believe for a second you're being honest. 
Ready for the million dollar revelation? We **know** LN "is not scalable"... to everyone in the entire world. Mind blowing, I know. And here's another one for you, and your big block masters:


No, it isn't. This is still absolutely shit as scaling, at the cost of reducing decentralization.
The reality, which every software engineer worth their weight understands, is that NONE of the various solutions scales... ALONE. Real scale comes only through putting all the various solutions together, including LN, channel factories, sidechains, drive chains, .... And yes, even completely centralized solutions like "bitcoin banks" will be part of the "scaling".
You can shove your "potential solutions" where they belong, in the dustbin of failed attacks on bitcoin. Meanwhile, bitcoin will scale in the only way it can, in layers.

LN is a layer on top of bitcoin that allows small payments to be extremely fast and final. ("Final" is key as something like an "instant bitcoin tx" is never final, it needs to go in a block.)
For now, LN is still somewhat cumbersome to use, but things are improving fast, damn fast. Once we reach a sufficient level of maturity, you won't know if you're using LN or if you're using old-fashioned on-chain transactions, and it won't matter. 
Why? Tell me, do you know what protocol your phone uses when you browse porn? What about when you FaceTime? Email? You most likely don't, but "the Internet" still works. 
Likewise, when bitcoin reaches the same level of maturity, you'll just "use bitcoin", and be none the wiser.

As I said, it's the sending wallet that determines what it can handle. It's possible that Bitstamp cannot deal with bech32 addresses, but I am pretty positive they can deal with P2SH, so just use that instead. It's still SegWit...

If you're saying there's problems with the EU or the EUR, I agree completely.

What you send to depends on the receiver, not on you. (I mean, you could refuse to send to a legacy address, but you likely have very little say on what option the receiver gives you.) And that doesn't depend on the sending address - You can send coins to a legacy address from a bech32 address no problem. Or better... it's the wallet you are using that is responsible for what can, and cannot, be done. And the same is true for the receiver, if their wallet software can't handle SegWit, there's nothing you can do other than ask them to implement it.

This is neither new nor surprising. It's also neither bad not good. It's just what happens when you introduce futures on a product, any product, and the futures market is more liquid than the spot.
Physically settled futures don't change this. Holding your coins doesn't change this. The only thing that changes this is more trading in the spot market. 
If more people want to buy, the price will go up. If more people want to sell, the price will go down. It doesn't matter in which market this happens.

Hope you guys won't get to mad, but I'm sorry to break it to you, LN is absolutely **not** the ultimate solution to scaling bitcoin. Why? Drum roll... 
**LN doesn't scale!**
That's right. LN, on it's own, cannot scale to planetary level, including Internet-of-Things and such. Sorry, it just doesn't. 
The ultimate scaling solution is a mix-and-match of very many scaling technologies. This includes channel factories, sidechains, drive chains, moving private keys off chain with solutions like OpenDimes, and other stuff which has yet to be invented/proposed/coded.
All of this combined, and only all of this combined, will scale bitcoin. OP is just a sensationalized click bait article, LN awesomeness notwithstanding.

Didn't watch, so not TL;DW... But answer is no and no. There will always be an equilibrium between LN and on-chain, and people will use whatever is best for the intended use. At the same time, this gives incentives to run a full node for LN, which will increase the number of economic full nodes, which is decentralization.

If your shitcoins are valued a lot in the market, paying shills is cheap. But when the shitcoins are closer to the true valuation (zero), it takes a LOT of shitcoins to pay them.

Bottom line, the cost becomes very real and cannot be sustained anymore.

There is no "theory"... they made a huge gamble, and got punished.
They supported bcash by mining it, and allegedly bought 1 out of every 8 bcash moved on the network. (The got to ~1m BCH during a period when ~8m BCH moved altogether.) In the meantime, the bear market bit, and bit hard. Their avg cost for the BCH was ~$850, which is how they are still valuing them to avoid the giant write downs.  Meanwhile, they placed giant orders for their S9 miners with hardware producers, just in time for the bear market and new competition that started to offer better, more efficient products. Bear market, fewer people mining, less hardware sold, huge inventories of inefficient hardware being sold below cost equals.... humongous losses. They financed their operations selling BTC for some time, but eventually run out. Allegedly now they have almost no bitcoin at all, just a huge bag of BCH and BSV, trying to find suckers to throw their cash at them so they can continue the party. Understandably people are not enthused by the idea.

The numbers are a bit questionable, but what it should tell you is how much money is there ready to buy/sell a coin. 
Market cap is extremely poor as a metric, especially in crypto. Let's say you are a major producer of mining hardware and you hold 1m shitcoins, and let's say one of them is ~$450. Great, you've got $450m, right? Wrong. That's only true IF, and that's a huge IF, you can sell all of them at $450, but you never can do that because as you start selling, you'll crash the price. Imagine you can sell 1,000 shitcoin @ $450, the next 2,000 only @ $440, then 5,000 @ $420 and so on. But the time you sold all 1m of them, you won't get $450m but anywhere between $450m and, very possibly, $50m with a huge bag of unsold coins because there's simply no one willing to buy them, even at $10! You'd totally annihilate the market.
The metric above tells you what's the money available on exchanges **now**, ready to buy/sell your favorite coin. The higher the number, the higher to amount of money buying/selling which will ensure the price won't change much.

So you can mess with the protocol as much as you want, create your altshitcoin, and invite your chums along for the ride, no problem. But if the exchanges implement it, and I lose money as a result, I'll sue the exchange. Or other custodian. And that is a very real threat to them.
As for the individuals, if you collude with an exchange and push them to cause me a loss, your ass might get on fire as well. Remember that even in this highly unregulated environment people did go to jail for scams on shitcoins. And don't forget Cryptsy - A class action is up against it, and "Big Ver" is hiding somewhere in Asia. And Cryptsy was not even regulated!!!
You still think the law does not apply??

I dislike banks like the other guy, but this is total bullshit.
The fed engaged in the repo market, with really short maturity. One day, up to two weeks at most, and even that is rare. In return, they get collateral, typically high quality bonds like US treasuries. And they get MORE collateral than the loan. This pretty much ensures that the "extra" money supply doesn't trickle into the economy because if the loan is not repaid they just sell the collateral and recoup the money.

I am firmly convinced ICOs will disrupt traditional VC. Some clarity will be necessary around it all, like you can't just issue fuck all (what's happening now) but you'll need to sell some shares in the startup basically, or debt, linked to the token, but it's just too easy to cut off the middle man with ICOs.

Miners are supposed to be competing for the block reward. 
AntPool is a mining pool controlled by Bitmain, which is not the most BTC friendly of all the companies/pools around. (Being ironic here, it's a pretty fair statement to say they are openly hostile to bitcoin, in the sense that they would like to control it.) 
ViaBTC is another pool, which was long thought to be just an extension of Bitmain/AntPool, though never really fully confirmed. This is pretty good evidence now.
It's also not good for the ecosystem if all the mining power is concentrated in the hands of few players, it makes attacks on the network much easier. If a single miner controlled 51%+ of the hashing power, they could launch a dreaded 51% attack, and rewrite the transactions as they please.
That Bitmain controls both AntPool and ViaBTC is not a good thing. Though as I said, it was long suspected.

Two way peg allows interchange of assets at a predefined rate. It's secured by the federation. This is not a replacement of the main chain, just a specific use case that will be useful for certain use cases. You don't always need the full security of the main chain, and a small degree of trust is acceptable in many cases. Just like when you leave your coins on an exchange...






There's a lot of money movement that happens today of which we have very little awareness of. Between huge financial institutions, that is. They'll be perfectly happy to transfer money over a side chain, especially since it's **confidential**. On the blockchain everything is public, and if you start seeing one institution doing a lot of a certain trade, others can understand what's going on, and profit from it. In trade, secrecy is absolutely fundamental.

Hmmm... I think this is already the case. Regulation also means stuff like segregation of funds so if the Co goes under, the customer funds are safe. And, for traditional businesses, the FDIC insures the funds.  Not 100% sure what's the status for BTC exchanges, but I have little doubt it will happen, if it didn't already.
And no one can enforce legal action against Core for stealing the value of gold, that's open competition. B2X is not, that's an open attack on bitcoin. It would be like a new precious metal displacing gold, vs selling gold-mixed-with-copper as pure gold. The former is legal and OK, the latter is criminal.

This is what I used multiple times (from 0.15.0.1 to 0.17) and it works like a charm.
The website is 
Try removing some of the config options, to see if there's a config you can run. My config is very similar to yours, except no GUI and no `-O2`. Maybe that can help narrow it down, and then you can post the bug on github.
Also, if you wanna start from scratch, no need to re-download the chain, and also no need to verify it from scratch. There's a new option in the config (think it's `assume-valid`) that allows you to specify a block height before which the chain is assumed valid. Since you downloaded and validated the chain yourself, I suspect you trust yourself not having provided yourself with fake data...
One thing, the `${USER}` above refers to the user that is running the config, so if you're running this as a different user, you may need to change it. If in doubt, specify the full path. And try with a `sudo` in front of everything...

As a LN node operator, connecting to Bitrefill is kinda painful. Thing is, they are a business and they need to pay their supplier in dirty old fiat. Which means they need to close the channels to cash out and convert the coins into fiat... and even though the fees are pretty low now, it doesn't make much sense for me to pay, say, ~1,200 sat to open a channel, earn ~1sat in fees from routing, that's how low LN fees are, only to have the channels closed because they need to cash out. People should just pay them on chain directly, though it's still great that they are experimenting with it.

There's no contradiction, in fact. Monopolies naturally emerge in a free market, in any free market. Simply because being big gives you way more power - From imposing barriers to entry to competition, to having more negotiating power etc.
Commercial banks will always exist, bitcoin or not. And the same is for Wall St. Commercial banks because families will always need money to buy a house, and businesses will need money to expand. (Note... I didn't say there will necessarily be debt behind those loans.) And Wall St because the "financial services" they offer are independent of underlying currency. If their clients will transact in bitcoin, Wall St will offer derivatives in bitcoin, it's that simple. 
This might be tough to swallow for many crypto enthusiasts, but it's still true.

You don't know how banking works, basically all of the above are wrong claims.


As I said, I am an industry insider, and believe me no one wants the regulations. Regulations means hire people, who then slow down everything, which ultimately means a much higher cost base. Meanwhile, trading of highly exotic products is dead, so the biggest money making is gone. Net result, lower profits, which means lower bonuses. If you think people lobbied for lower bonuses...


Only partially true. Let's say you're a bank and you have $10m. With fractional reserve, that means you can lend ~$100m. After you give all the $100m out, which you don't need Wall St for, what next? You're done, no more lending. 


Incorrect. Banks take collateral as *guarantee* to the loans, to reduce the risk. But the collateral does not, on it's own, create the loan. The bank must have money on their books to lend it out. (Or better, a fraction of it, due to fractional reserve lending.)


See above. And this is where Wall St comes in... When the bank runs out of steam, Wall St picks it up by buying mortgages off the bank, repackaging them (MBS anyone?) and selling them onwards. Bank gets cash to lend some more, Wall St gets fees and mom&amp;pop get mortgages in their 401k, or other pension pot. And the cycle continues.

You may want to re-read the entire thread... it was always about a legal threat for the custodians of the funds, who have a fiduciary duty to protect your funds. In other words, JGarzik can do whatever he wants, change the code as he pleases, no problem. But the exchanges need to pay close attention to what they are doing. And to deploy code that is buggy with known problems which have been highlighted be several developers, would very likely be considered complete negligence if it led to loss of funds.
As for the individuals, it is not impossible that some individuals might get thrown into this as well. You know, a bit like when Goldman got sued for selling crap to investors in 2008. Yes, the investors bought, but Goldman was advising and pushing hard to sell. So if someone is excessively overzealous on pushing for S2X, and an exchange buys into that, they may both end up with their ass on fire. But here I'm just guessing, don't really know.

That's not how it works... If miners decide to fork off by themselves, but no economic node accepts their blocks, they don't get paid because they are mining their own altcoin. And if a 90% majority switches, I suspect Core already have emergency plans in place, like a change of PoW algorithm + one off difficulty adjustment for the remaining miners.
The question is how many of the economic nodes will switch. ITT you acknowledge miners will follow the money, so this is the real question. If **only** BitPay goes S2X, they have their own altcoin, the miners won't follow. And that's not BTC, no matter how much they wish it was. BitPay is big, sure, but don't know how much of the actual economic power it actually represents, but is nowhere near a majority. So they will be the minority.
BitPay also has it upside down, they seem to believe miners make decisions on bitcoin. They don't, economic nodes do. And so far, it seems that explicit support for S2X **backed by actions** is not strong. That is, not many businesses have embraced S2X by installing new software.
It's a different story if the economic majority decides to switch...

No they won't. If full nodes don't accept miner's blocks, those new blocks are not bitcoin. 
The infrastructure in place now is not easily replaceable just like that. And the current infrastructure accepts bitcoin. If miners ONLY switch, they'll be securing an altcoin, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:56:49
Yes. Unquestionably. Without the shadow of a doubt.
If they could, they would already have done it. Also, they would have to amass more hashing power than all the other hashing power currently supporting the BTC network, or they would not be able to control 51% of the mining. And do this whilst no one else is doing anything.

One thing it certainly means is that you have a fiduciary duty to your clients to preserve their wealth. So if you lose people money because you install shitty software, you are on the hook for it. 
Much like your stockbroker cannot upgrade their systems and lose your money, that would piss you off quite a bit, wouldn't it?

Not disagreeing... but at this point I think it's past the stage where a govt crackdown can do much. The genie is out of the proverbial bottle.
But there's another reason. The filthy rich people do not care how their wealth is preserved. They only care about preserving their wealth. Fiat currency is known to be a poor store of value, and when the rich wake up to the power of crypto, to the possibility of doging taxes by moving capital cross borders anonimously, you can bet your ass they will lobby the politicians to establish crypto friendly rules, or risk generational wealth be wiped out by incompetent politicians and reckless monetary policies. Even though they will be in it only for themselves, the rich will likely end up helping cryptos massively.

You don't understand the futures market. Read [this]( I tried to explain how it works and it's relationship to the spot market in particular.
There ARE people who want to take delivery of 100 tons of pork belly... bacon producers, for instance. 
Gold cannot be inflated, and yet there's a lot more "paper gold" than "physical gold". The same will be true for bitcoin. And yet this doesn't do anything for the price. Or better, what this does is it stabilizes the price because all of a sudden there's a LOT more demand on both the long and the short side. The wild swings in bitcoin happen for a very simple reason, there's not enough buy/sell support so a whale can move the market significantly. If there were $100 billion of buy AND sell support, Barts would not exist in bitcoin trading.


What are you talking about??? Please stop the conspiracies.
The much simpler truth is that price goes up when people are willing to pay increasingly higher price to hold the asset. And price goes down when people would rather get rid of the asset than hold it. And this can be expressed either in the spot market or in the futures market since the two are very tightly related, as I explained in that post. Settlement prices are a consequence of this simple fact.
Our primordial brains need a "reason", a "villain" to see behind price action. This is not to say there's no manipulation in the bitcoin market, but simply that futures on their own do not cause prices to decrease or increase.
Last comment... I've been through 2014 myself, and still hodling happily, so get off that high horse. And I agree that to someone patient enough buying near ATH will prove successful. But most people who bought near ATH bought out of FOMO, and are now regretting it. To them it doesn't matter that others got rich... they think they made a bad investment, and need "reasons" to explain market behaviour. Bubbles burst, no manipulation needed.

There's about 60-70 hedge funds in the pipeline being set up to invest in cryptos. And firms are being allowed to trade crypto derivatives through perfectly regulated exchanges. Might not be all that many years away.
Also, there's much more speculation now, when you've got single whales running the market (almost) as they please. Once institutional money comes in, regulated, those now-whales will become small fish.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:17:39
Not true. People hear, and know, about bitcoin. Not some "legacy chain that is technically superior and supported by great devs". People don't give a shit about this, it's the name that counts. And the S2X people know it, that's why no replay protection, creates mess and allows to take over the brand name.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:09:45
What you need for something to be a currency is for that asset to be also a store of value. That doesn't mean that the value needs to increase, but it must not fluctuate must. We're not there yet, bitcoin is fluctuating a lot.
Once the market cap hits a certain level, and I don't know what that level is, "corrections" will not be 10%-30% anymore, too much money will be involved. At that point, the corrections will be 1%-3%, which is something you see in regular fiat trading now. That's important because then merchants will be much more comfortable to take payments in bitcoin, and hold the bitcoin instead of selling for fiat immediately. People will also be much more accustomed to it, so will recognize a price of, say, 0.000023 BTC for some service, and will happily pay with it.
In other words, you could say that hodling now actually does help establish bitcoin as money through the mechanism I described. But it won't happen overnight.

@_date: 2018-10-17 02:10:23


Sorry, but this is not true. And I'm telling you this as someone who is living the consequences of '08 from inside a bank. Zero down mortgages are virtually unheard of, and certainly there's no derivatives being created on top of those. And it was the leverage in the derivatives that caused proper havoc. Not to mention all the regulations that are killing banks in general. Regulators are transforming banks into utilities. But that's not a sexy story that gets told very often.
On banks, it is generally not very appreciated just how interconnected Wall St is with the real economy. For one, a huge portion of all the money is saved in very few banks, which means that those banks that were healthy would not have been able to continue with much lending. Second, all the mortgages they issue are being taken off their plate by Wall St, giving banks fresh money to lend again. If Wall St goes down, banks stop lending as soon as they run out of capacity. And lastly, if Wall St goes down, so many companies like GE and similar would come to a grinding halt SO fast it's pretty scary to even think about. That's because most of these companies run on debt, and need money markets to finance their daily operations.
Look, I'm not saying bail outs and QE were the right thing to do. Letting the system fail and heal would have been the right thing to do. But the problem is that the consequences would be so painful short term, even if good long term, that no one was ready to pull the trigger. And the proper inflation is yet to come, but QE didn't really cause very much of it, it was a tame 2% or less per year. At least for consumer goods, financial markets are a different story.

Didn't want to write too much, but if I did, I'd have written something very close to your follow up. ICOs must be linked to the company's assets, somehow, and I absolutely want the regulators to be vigilant and prosecute as necessary. Screaming down with all regulations and other such libertarian cries completely misses that the laws are there for a reason, that humans didn't start scamming with crypto. And yes, I also want enforcement by a physical entity, no freaking DAOs, unless it's something really marginal.
With all this said, I think you can see we agree in large part. And if we find a clean way to do ICOs, and I believe we will, VC will be reduced to investment advisory because no one will be able to keep track of all the (legit) ICOs. Just like people can't keep track of all the scams today.

OK, this is one of the few actually meaningful replies as to why you may want to cash out. Ironically, it largely overlaps with what I've said in the OP. I hope you see this.
Living debt free and owning property are the big financial commitments I mention above. What I did not go into very explicitly was the hedging part, and **I actually agree with it**! But that's why the title is "consider not cashing out". So let's say that you are interested in growing your capital (a bit), getting an income stream (mainly), and preserving your wealth (moderately). This pretty much leaves you with something like crypto for capital growth, passive stock market index and/or govt bonds for yield, and gold/silver as a store of value. 
If you re-read my OP, you'll see that I largely cover all your three points...

A bit like saying that every cash purchase should be recorded with a bank.

About 70 hedge funds are being set up to invest in cryptos, regulators are starting to approve trading and clearing of crypto derivatives, so Wall St can get involved, and there's good hope a bitcoin ETF will be approved soon.

No. Satoshi knew that, and it's one of the reasons he said it. You cannot overstate the importance of consensus in Bitcoin, and different implementations increase the possibility to introduce incompatible consensus bugs. Let's say you rebuild the protocol from scratch. Unless you're God, there will be bugs. This means that at a most unexpected moment the network will fork because of tiny incompatibilities in consensus. your new implementation that was supposed to protect the network is, in fact, weakening it. This is why it's better to have the network go down entirely than have different implementations.

As I read the tweet, came here to say exactly the same. As a matter of fact, I'm holding a small contest at work to see who's gonna be the first to open a crypto trading desk. Of course, my bet is GS.
But yeah, Wall St doesn't care about which money is used. And not many people realize Wall St doesn't really lend any money. By far and large, Wall St will just shuffles and moves the money around, and takes a fee. And if that money is crypto, they will do so.
Side note: You'll know Bitcoin truly succeeded when every shop on Wall St will have crypto trading desk.

The "flat fee" is only a part of the story. (Admittedly, so does the headline...)
First, that's the "sender bank" fee for the transfer. There's a "receiver bank" fee on the other side waiting which is roughly the same.
Second, the $50 fee is a fee that typically applies to "large" sums of money for us, commoners. That is, ~$100,000. But sending ~$194m is a different story altogether. I have direct confirmation from a financial institution that routinely moves hundreds of millions across the globe, and the fee is 5 basis points, or 0.05% of the sum, which gets capped at approx $500. But that's between *financial institutions*! for a commoner, that cost would go up significantly.
Third, the bank must *agree* to sending the money, and that cannot be arranged just like that - Walk into a bank and send $194m. As the saying goes, "owe someone a million dollars and you've got a problem. Owe someone a billion dollars and THEY'VE got a problem". And cash in a bank is a bank's liability, i.e. they **owe** it to you. The bank may decline the transfer, simply because they don't have that kind of money at hand. 
Fourth, so you give them a heads up, in a month you need to move the money. This will trigger all sorts of check and they may simply decline the transfer for whatever reason the checks revealed.
Fifth, the **bank** sending fee applies when there's a receiving **bank** on the other side. How about sending money to someone without a bank?
Sixth, the money will NOT be credited within 1hr...
Most importantly... Bitcoin's real benefits are not the low transaction fees. This is a current "benefit" which distorts the narrative, and will disappear once the network starts to run at full capacity. On-chain fees will be high in order to incentivize miners. Fees will go much higher than now, and that's why LN and other off-chain solutions have been (and are being) built.

It's about money management, sell low to avoid selling even lower. And if you see that the price is rising, buy and ride with it.
Keep in mind that traders want to maximize the amount of fiat, not bitcoin. And they are not in it necessarily for the long term, just make $100,000 per year, and they are mighty happy, even if that means losing coins compared to a hodler.

There will be bumps in the road, but the price is not driven entirely by speculation, as some people would have it. Yes, there is speculation, and though I can't tell you "Prixe = x% speculation, (1-x)% demand", one thing is for sure - There's new money coming into BTC every day. And this does not yet include institutional investors. Once "smart money" comes in, they will buy a ton of cryptos, and put them away. Lowering supply. Lower supply, increasing demand... I'll let you guess what happens to the price.

They have a fiduciary duty to protect their customers funds, and if they recklessly install software that leads to a loss of funds, they can be sued.

If you read my post you'll see that I end the post by saying that if the majority of the economic nodes does decide to support S2X, it's another story. That means a very simple thing, the consensus has changed, and that's it. The market will have decided.
And your argument about a block first being mined is a chicken and egg problem, which doesn't really play a role from a game theoretical point of view. Miners will simply mine where the money is... and if the economic majority does not move, the miners will not move. So far, there's a big list of signatories for NYA, but except for BitPay, no real commitment. Why no real commitment? No one seems to have changed their software, did they? Talk is cheap... I want to see real commitment before I accept that the sentiment is shifting. So far, I'm pretty satisfied that it doesn't seem to be the case. And I hope it stays that way.
Miners cannot do much on their own, and they know it. It's why they are pissed at SegWit, which only served to show this once UASF came on the scene.

We are only seeing the real nature of miners, who are driven by selfish profit. This was always the case, and bitcoin's design accounts for this. Miners only mine for profit not because they are in it for the greater good. I don't blame them for it, electricity, people's wages, facilities rent/amortization and what have you have a real cost, which miners have to cover. And make some profit, of course. It's business. I don't think any seasoned bitcoiner is excessively surprised by the diff oscillations. 
The reason to point this (obvious) fact out is simple: The joke is entirely on the fervent BCash crowd. The people who thought they have a friend in Jihan and Roger. They are now the ones left scratching their heads about why the hell don't they just commit to the new coin, it's what they wanted, after all?!?! 
No miner is loyal to any coin, they are in it for the profit. And if they can control bitcoin, they will only direct it for their own profit. It's only natural, we cannot change human nature. It's also why we must resist the efforts to centralise it. One might only hope the forked crowd comes to realise this.

You know, when you talk make an argument you have to options. One, you outline the general idea in the hope that people who read it will get it. Two, you start laying down all the fucking assumptions necessary to make the claim exact:
"*If every purchase you make is for the exact same amount of X dollars, and your double spend success rate is Y%, then you get an exact saving of Y% on every purchase. But as soon as your purchases are of different value, then your savings will vary. For instance, if you have a successful double spend on your largest purchase, then you could save a lot more. Actually, in the limit of (success double spend) to infinity, the savings are a neat 100%. Conversely, if you consider the limit of (success double spend) to zero, your savings will be exactly zero. QED.*"

What am I gonna do? I'll keep hodling, but I don't know if that's the right thing for you. I'll hodl because there are ~70 hedge funds in the pipeline with focus on crypto. That should, in my mind, bump the price up for many of these shitcoins. Don't know how much though, and also not sure if it will happen or not. But my loss is nowhere near as big as yours, so take that for what it is, a comment from an Internet stranger.

Welcome to the party. And now HODL!
Big blocks are the "obvious" scaling choice: Only 3 tx/sec because of 1MB blocks? Let's increase the block size! It's so simple even a 7yr old kid could come up with it. Yet reality is never as simple, and simply increasing the block size comes with several drawbacks. Might not be apparent now, but wait a few years and see what happens with Bcash.
There are many optimizations that you can do **BEFORE** increasing the block. SegWit is an example of this: Instead of increasing the block size, you reduce the transaction size. And there are other optimizations coming (Schnorr signatures) that will reduce the size of the transactions even more (-ish, very technical guys will correct me here). Only once these an other optimizations are coming it will make sense to start increasing the block size, **which even core developers support in the long run**!
And then there are layer 2 optimizations/enhancements, like Lightning Network, just around the corner. These will make transactions **extremely** cheap and fast. This is a bit like exchanging cash (LN) instead of settling all the payments through a bank (direct blockchain transfer). And when you really think about it, do you really want your coffee purchase to be stored on the blockchain FOR EVER???
Finally, the people pushing for B2X are trying to make a political statement. Jihan Wu, from Bitmain, openly said he wants to "fire core developers". Why would you say that, after all the amazing work they did?? The answer is actually fairly simple, if you think about it, they are not catering to his wishes and desires. He does not control them, and wants to get rid of them. (Btw, he also said he want to make BTC inflationary, i.e. remove the 21m cap...) As a matter of fact, Jihan Wu also said the SegWit transactions are "unfairly cheap". This is understandable, he's a miner and wants as much $$$ as quickly as possible, but putting all these pieces together you can see how his intentions are not aligned with the rest of us, **and that includes YOU**. Why? If you remove the 21m cap, BTC won't be no good store of value, will it? Similarly, Roger Ver wanted to install a Bitcoin CEO, centrally controlled by him, presumably. Do we really want yet-another-centrally-controlled currency?
Point is, this is much more about making a political statement now than anything else. If the people behind B2X can push for this change, they can, and will, push for many other changes which will certainly benefit them, and probably not us.

Yes, absolutely. Perhaps I should have clarified that this is what I believe will happen, and was a bit of a joke. But is it really **that unfathomable**?


Or is it? Goldman Sachs is telling their institutional clients they can no longer ignore the crypto market as investment, Google it. Think what you will of GS, but I'll take their understanding of financial markets over your


anytime of the day.
And the main point of the OP, since you seem to have missed it, is that BTC is different from stocks. If it *really* does become the 21st century **money**, then it won't be nothing like stocks, but like... you know, money. Just use it, no "cashing out". You don't "cash out USD", do you?


This is where you really kill me, and show to the world you are not thinking straight in your head. So I must not spend **some** of my BTC because that would make me regret all the money lost in future price gains. But cashing out, aka *giving ALL your BTC away for fiat*, is OK because... the guy who I sold my BTC to for fiat will share the BTC gains later??? 
So yeah, looks like I won't be taking any advice from you anytime too soon.

Your best bet is to find someone who can sell you the coins in person, imo. People already mentioned LocalBitcoin, but have a look at other forums and see if anyone is willing to sell you some coins. Then meet in a coffee shop or something. Because of sanctions and all that, it might be problematic to get coins from one of the popular exchanges.
As for wallets, do your research. But keep in mind even a paper wallet will do, if you can't get your hands on a hardware wallet. Ideally, try to get a hw wallet. Problem with Trezor is they only accept BTC for payment, don't know about Ledger.

Not convinced. Your software is alpha, you tag it as such and let people know they are at risk of losing funds by using it. Then it's up to the individual if they use it or not.
This could come back to hunt the devs as users complain and are turned off by the product, even though it might have been their own dumbness leading to the loss. But it's something devs should do form themselves, not for users. Again, that's where personal responsibility comes in.

I wish that was true, but it's demonstrably false. If some sort of technical superiority was the only thing that matters, we'd all be using Linux today. Instead most are using Windows. And that was true even 20yrs ago when we were fighting with blue screens of death on Win95.
This is not the only example. The name and the hype behind it matter. Yes, you can say that "in the end the superior tech wins", but on Wall St they like to say in the end we're all dead. It does very little good if we have to go through a bunch of crypto collapses of various iterations of Jihancoin only to end up on the original legacy chain again. We'll be dead by then!

You CSW cult clowns are technically illiterate. It's called "segregated" witness, not "eliminated" witness. Signature data has simply been put in a different part of the block, not removed. A full node will still check the signature for validity, but I guess that's beyond your level of understanding.


I don't think they are adding SegWit, they pooped on it for way too long.

It's nonsense. BCash supporters will do whatever they can to hurt Bitcoin, like spreading false news that will confuse newbies. You are an example.
Every payment on LN is fully funded by an on-chain BTC tx. It's like a gift card, you pay upfront, and then get to use it. Except more flexible as you can spend everywhere, not just at one shop. 
No money is created with LN. Unless, of course, you're interested in confusion. Then you can create whatever you want, even print dollars on LN. But that's another story.

Of course it matters which crypto emerges as dominant. If a centralized shitcoin controlled by a handful of scammers can overtake bitcoin, then "crypto" is over.

You need to be a bit more refined in your claims, more subtle thinking is required. If 2000 people start transacting between them, on established routes, sending money back and forth for pure fun, 3.5m txs is ~2000txs per user.

You should do your homework before talking, you'd realize that these two statements are contradicting.
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:27:54
The SegWit discount is designed to incentivise a *reduction* of the UTXO set. It can happen, without SegWit, that it's *cheaper* to increase the UTXO set than to *reduce* it. Say when batching txs. This is a conflict between what's good for users (low fees) and what's good for the network (small UTXO set). The SegWit discount addresses this, so the good for the user is aligned with the good for the network.
Schnorr is independent, but it works in the same direction - Consolidating dust significantly reduces the UTXO set. If dust is sitting in unused UTXOs that cannot be moved due to fees, that's quite the burden to carry for the entire network. So you're again benefiting as a user, but the network benefits SO much as well.
I'm personally seriously excited about Schnorr. It's just... wow. Such wow.

BitPay was one of the companies behind the biggest attack on bitcoin so far, SegWit2X. It was an attempt to seize control of bitcoin, and the community pushed back hard, which thwarted the attempt.
They are also refusing to implement SegWit, even though they wanted SegWit2X... 
They are pushing bcash to their users by deceptive tactics.
Lastly, they now want KYC not from merchants, but from people paying merchants. This is now limited to $3k+ payments, but you can bet your sats that limit will slowly decreasing over time.
Just don't use it, and anytime you find a merchant that does, email them and ask them to switch to BTCPayServer.

The network. The difficulty adjustment algorithm aims to ensure blocks are produced at an average rate of 1 every 10min. If hash rate goes up, diff increases. If hash rate drops, diff drops.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:42:30
You don't have to be anti-btc to ask this question, people have been thinking about it since the beginning :)
The short answer is that it's not very practical, and people will not be using that. So far some merchants would accept it and take the risk of a double spend with a good deal of confidence that it won't be attempted. This helped the community get to where we are today.
In the future, though, nobody will use BTC for small purchases... that's what LN will be for. Instant (or almost) and super low fees, with no possibility of a charge back/double spend. For large txs, you'll have on-chain txs for which you'll need pay a good fee, and wait ~1hr to get the unbeatable peace of mind of PoW security.

Unpopular opinion: Bitcoin will not destroy banks nor Wall St. Bitcoin will make *central banks* obsolete, but not the former.
Short explanation. Banks are in the business of lending money. They don't care what that money is. So unless you want to argue that bitcoin will eliminate the need to borrow money, in which case I've got a bridge to sell you, banks will continue to exist. They will change their business models, but that's it. Carry on as usual.
As soon as banks exist, so will Wall St. This is way too long to explain even in short, so I'll just say that Wall St is in the business of trading debt, amongst other things. Banks issue loans, and thus create debt. Wall St takes that debt off a bank's hands and sells it on to anyone who wants it.
Example: Banks issues mortgages &gt; Wall St buys mortgages from banks &gt; Wall St repackages them as "mortgage backed securities" (MBS) &gt; Wall St sells MBS to Asset Managers &gt; You give money to asset mangers as contributions to your pension pot.
This closes the circle. So unless you think bitcoin will change our desire to have a house, or a pension, or our desire to increase our stash through investing, or the capitalist nature of the entire system, banks and Wall St will continue to exist and thrive with bitcoin.

The main difference between r/bitcoin and r/btc is that here we are all looking for ways to improve Bitcoin and push it forward as much as it can be. Phenomenal tech developments and crazy innovation, from in the trenches coding to academic, fundamental research. On r/btc, on the other hand, what holds them together is a hate for Bitcoin, not love for BCash. So they will take every opportunity they have to shit on Bitcoin. And this is quite literal - Have a look at the posts over there, most posts that reach the front page are about how shit Bitcoin is, for this or that reason. Not to mention that their collective understanding of Bitcoin is pretty poor, seriously flawed.
Good tech takes time to develop, and the LN was in the making for a long time. It's now live since ~Feb. We've been waiting for it for some time, and are all excited about it. Once of the main criticisms to Bitcoin were the "high" fees, and OP just shatters this narrative with a real life example. Up to you to decide if Bitcoin failed or it's thriving, but I know I'm not selling my coins.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:46:48
When you're clueless, please refrain from speaking.
BCash is a freaking copy/past clone of Bitcoin from ~2rys ago, it's the same tech up to that point. The 0-conf you lot believe is SO good on BCash has been rejected by the community at large as a "secure" payments method. Because double spends are just too easy to pull off. 
Not to mention that RBF is opt-in, which means that if you **don't** opt-in, it's the exact same thing. But that's probably flying over your ideological head.

I beg of you, please drop XRP. Maybe only bitconnect was worse than ripple, and I'm also not sure about that.
Buying ripple is literally giving money to Ripple Labs and making their execs rich. Since the company controls ~60% of the supply, the price cannot go up until all of that has been absorbed. And that's a lot to absorb.
If you want to diversify, then consider LTC, XMR, BNB, UNU SED LEO, SC, DCR or some other coin that doesn't scream scam a million miles away.

Investing in alts is not necessarily bad, the real problem is **which** alts. There are so many out there, and most are outright scams. (Something like 90% of the ICOs in 2017 already failed...)
If you go for a Lindy approach (the longer it's been out there, the longer its expected existence), you should probably invest in LTC and XMR. Of course, the bulk of it should be Bitcoin. (Keep in mind one thing, the difficulty to change Bitcoin is not a "governance bug" but a feature. Possibly the best feature! You don't want your money to change according to the latest fashion...) 
Other alts? Sure... just do your own research.
You'll notice I didn't include ETH, I'm not a big fan. They have many problems and seem to ignore them, almost on purpose. But then again, this is where your own research comes in, maybe you'll disagree and go for it.
Decide **now** what are you gonna do with those coins. Are you gonna trade or are you gonna HODL? You can make money both ways, but the absolutely best way to lose money is to think you'll hodl and then panic sell because you thought you'd buy back in at a lower price. Guaranteed loss.

But Roger is also not a moron when it comes to his own pocket, and by now he's realized that bcash failed, and pouring more money into it is hopeless. You can only fight the market for so long. So how do you get out of a shit hole? Give up CEO, and let him do the dirty work.

It's not the block increase as such, but what it represents AND how it's being done.
There's only one dev working on it. And he's got 3 months to pull off code with no bugs. That's hard even for a team. In short, not enough testing, not enough dev support, not enough community support.
Then there's the issue of what it represents. S2X was a closed door agreement between companies and miners. The devs were asked to sign the agreement after it has been decided. In other words, no real support from the biggest experts on blockchain in the world. So what it represents is a power grab, Co's want to centralize and control the underlying protocol.
Finally, it's not really needed at this point. People are pushing for a change which is not really needed now - Anyone who disagrees only needs to look at the fees and confirmation times over the weekend when the hash power was back in full swing on BTC. Let's build second layer solutions on top of the blockchain FIRST, and then everyone will be on board with the block size increase. Guaranteed.

The general philosophy for Bitcoin is optimize first, bigger blocks after. So... first we do Schnorr, MAST and Bulletproofs. We also start using the LN a lot AND we build *channel factories* (look them up). The latter can reduce the impact on the blockchain up to 96%. With txs batching, there's a lot of room to grow - It's been estimated that ~12% of tthe daily txs carry as much as ~60% of the total value transacted. So how much can we get out of that 1MB block if we get ~80% of all txs batched?
Bottol line, there's a lot of room for optimization before we actually need a block size increase. But be 100% reassured that once all of this is implemented, the block size will be increased, if not enough. And as others noticed, never if it means compromising the ability to run your own node for cheap.

This is broken, completely. It's actually for small purchases that double spends are the most "useful" because no one will sue your ass for a $2.50 coffee. 
It's also where most of the spending will happen, so all you need is a wallet that, by default, double spends. Walk into store, buy and walk away, wallet automatically double spends 1min later. Even if your success rate is, say, ~10%, you just got a ~10% discount on everything you bought. Very quickly merchants will wise up, and increase the prices. Or stop accepting crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:20:23
In short, yes. Nothing would change for you.
Longer answer: The LN, excluding the opening/closing of channels, is "unaware" of the underlying layer. Which is kind of the whole point, making transactions without broadcasting on the blockchain. So you would continue to use the coins with no problems. 
In this sense, it doesn't make much sense to say that the new chain "doesn't have a functioning LN". It does.
A LN channel is a 2-2 multisig address, and the key to trustlessness is that you control both keys! (And so does Alice.) So let's say you want to close the channel after the fork (open before, close after, as that's the only unclear scenario). What happens? You broadcast the closing tx, which will be picked up by a forked node, which will accept it as valid and relay it to its peers, which will do the same. (LN txs are nothing but "closing on-chian txs" which have not been broadcast yet. Which means they always contain everything necessary to close the channel and spend the funds to addresses controlled by one party only.) Eventually it gets confirmed. Nodes will relay it because the private keys are valid on the old as well as on the new chain. If the fork was  non-controversial, the old chain will be dead, so who cares. If it was controversial, you'll just have coins on both chains.
The delicate part, as I see it, is to handle things properly for channels that will close right about at the time of the activation. Which is why I think additional layers do make it harder to fork, but I'm sure it's not something that cannot be overcome.

That an intermediary increases tx costs is.a truism - Absolutely true in every trade, not just money. That still doesn't pinpoint what the cost of a single tx should be. We only know it's gonna be lower, and this is true. Spending bitcoin costs less than spending with a cc over ~$100. Prob less. You think not, but it is because the fees are priced in the goods and amount easy to ~4%. Would be interesting to compare with physical cash... after you account for all the costs of cash, from printing to moving around the country, and then within a city, and of course inflation. My guess, it'd be very similar, if not more expensive. Physical cash that is.

"Wait, that's fractional reserve!!! See, they lied!!!"
No you brainlet, they didn't. And this actually shows it was 100% backed in the past. It was **after** the $850mm loan to Finex that Tether went fractional reserve. What about before? Yes, fully collateralized.
What about now? Well, they disclosed the change to their clients and offered them the ability to get their money out. Not a single client did it. The opposite, in fact, they all put even more money with Tether!

Depends on how easy you want that to be... Easiest, but with KYC/AML is to register with an exchange, say Gemini, and set up regular purchases. This will cost you 1%. A bit more complex, but not really if you have 2 working brain cells, is to register as an advanced trader and get access to their full trading platform, and this will cost you 0.25% iirc.
This is also the cheapest there is. Anything else will be more expensive as everyone ultimately relies on exchanges, and applies an extra fee on top.
If you don't want KYC, then look into bisq or hodl hodl. P2P exchanges, but not as liquid, so cost will be higher. I would recommend these as that's how bitcoin is meant to be, without 3rd parties.
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:33:35
Every time you spend Bitcoin you get some of it back into a "change address", think giving a $20 bill to pay something for $17. Over time, for various reasons, these change addresses tend to increase in number and you could end up in a situation where you have 10 wallets each containing small change, let's say $1.10 each. Say you now want to spend $10, you'll need to reach into all the wallets to pay the full amount. 
Problem is, each wallet requires a (digital) signature to spend the money, a bit like a check. So 10 wallets/checks, 10 signatures. And signatures are large (i.e. they take space on the blockchain), which means you are paying a tx fee for every one of the signatures, and this adds up very quickly. In the worst case, your total fee gets larger than the amount you are trying to move!
Schnorr? One signature no matter the number of inputs! (If you control them.) So your 10 wallets/checks would only require 1 signature, making spending the money a lot less expensive.
This is fantastic for both users (lower on chain fees when moving dust) and for the network (less space used on-chain). The latter in turn means more txs fitting in a single block, which in turn means even lower fees for users!!

I'm sure there was some short term liquidity problem, I don't think that's debatable. The real question is if there's also a problem of solvency rather than just short term liquidity. The latter can dry up simply because "shit happens". Think of needing $$ to pay for your dinner and the credit card doesn't work because unbeknownst to you your bank closed your account because you bought bitcoin. Sometimes shit just happens with no real reason behind. So far there is no reason to panic about bank solvency.

We **wrote** the dictionary as we were going along.
A bitcoin fork is, in practice, a shitcoin that was generated by copy/pasting bitcoin's code and changing something so you can sell it by saying it's a "better bitcoin". The starting point is important, and if the fork doesn't start from scratch (block 0) but is planned for some block height H, Then everyone who has bitcoin at H will also have the forked coin. At least in principle. In practice it's non trivial to claim the new shitcoin and most people wait for some wallet dev to do it and make it available for everyone.

This is very confused. banks are cutting jobs because they are not profitable anymore, and a large part of that has to do with negative interest rates. Some of this is due to markets, but a lot of it has to do with negative rates from central banks. Which means that CB policy is directly hurting banks.

Think of it like a check - Every txs needs to be signed to be valid. Now imagine that the bank gives you a very specific pen that must be used to sign the check. Whoever controls checkbook+pen can sign the check and move your money.
In bitcoin you sign txs with "private keys". Whoever controls the private key, controls the coins.
"Signing offline" basically means signing the transaction in complete, total privacy. Think signing the check in the total privacy of your toilet. Signing your transactions online would be a bit like carrying the checkbook and pen always with you, people could steal it.
If you sign offline your private keys are never exposed to potential thieves. Of course, to actually move the money you still need to broadcast (announce) the transaction, but to do that you don't need to expose the private keys.

Guys this is misleading at best, and outright false at worst.
The Fed is engaging in the repo market to achieve the target rate they decide on. In particular they are targeting the "overnight rate". This means that they will enter repo ("repurchase agreements") with one day term - Lend the money for one day, and then call it off. Every day they will lend the **same money** again. You cannot add this up, it's the same money. And this money doesn't even have the time to trickle into the economy... because the loan is over after one day.

Once we are consistently at capacity on-chain fees will be high. But at that point someone like an exchange will batch the payments, so the total fee will be split amongst several users. Let's say a $50 fee gets split in 10, that's a $5 fixed cost for you until you deplete your channel, which will not be very often since you can also receive funds on it. And if an exchange uses the LN... all the cheaper!

it's a non-trivial piece of research... means fundamental cryptographic research had to be done to make it happen. There's no "Schnorr for Bitcoin giftbox" available to just use promptly. So it's delicate.


The worst? I guess the network comes to a halt and you lose your socks in the market? 
But that's one thing I'm not worried about - you can bet every last Satoshi you've got that Core are not gonna leave a single corner un-polished before this gets released. Will be running on testnet first, tons of people will review the code, bugs will be ironed, etc... 
Roger thinks Core are the worst team devs in crypto, but they are more like the *absolute best*. And when it comes to consensus layer changes, the very thing Bitcoin crucially relies on, it won't go live until there's a TON of testing accumulated. And even then it will be tested for another 3 months.
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:11:47
Not sure where you got this from, but it shows a lack of basic understanding of bitcoin, so dubious it comes from Satoshi. 
Miners do fight for transactions, but the restriction doesn't come from number of miners that compete for txs, but from nodes enforcing consensus rules. The block size, in particular. So even with more miners, there would be no more txs being processed than now, and hence no difference in fees.
Satoshi understood this quite well. Maybe you're providing a liberal interpretation to his words and/or taking things out of context?

There is no risk of fees getting uncomfortably large, there's **certainty** fees will become so large it simply will not be economic to transact on-chain for most purposes. I'm talking easily north of $100 per tx. This will ensure mining subsidy will be in place and miners can continue to secure the network.
You are probably wondering how will we use Bitcoin then, and the answer is off-chain. Once the system has reached truly significant adoption (will take another decade or more...) most people will **never** transact on-chain because it will not be affordable. Off-chain solutions like LN will take care of everyday need to transact cheaply. 
This might sound crazy but it's not. The bitcoin base layer offers some properties that no money in history had, which is censorship resistance and permissionless. These properties are so valuable, there's absolutely no reason why they would be cheap, if you think about it. And then ask yourself, do you really need this kind of impenetrable security for your everyday coffee? I think not. (Also remember that every tx is for ever registered on the blockchain... and I don't want to store your coffee on my node for ever.) Bottom line, on-chain will be reserved for those cases where it's absolutely needed, when paying the high fee will be a price worth paying, like sending money to help people in an oppressive regime. Or get it out of it. And so on. But when censorship resistance is not key (who is gonna censor your coffee purchase??) you'll use other layers of the "bitcoin stack" that will allow you to transact for much less, though you'll have to compromise a little bit on security etc.

Yes... or they won't be mining for much longer.


Yes, someone needs to reward miners for their work. Currently the network rewards them via block reward. Eventually tx fees will make up for that. In which case you can expect on-chain fees to be **much** higher.


Unlikely. Maybe someone will come up with a different consensus algorithm that doesn't require "mining" and provides the same security to the network as mining does, but my personal intuition is that it cannot be done. In any event, until such an algorithm is found mining will be with us.
Besides, why do you want to do away with mining?

This obviously shows you missed the point of the EU altogether. The EU, first and foremost, is a peace project. A project to stop EU countries go to war with eachother all the time, which in history was happening every few decades on average, iirc. But you grew up in unprecedented times of European peace, and think this is the norm, so you start shaking the stick at the entire project because you know better. You should see your friends die in war, or you and your mother should see your father/husband die in war. Perhaps experience the devastation of bombs raining on your home city. Then you'd start appreciating the EU. Because then you'd say having a father and all your friends alive is much better than whatever bothers you about the EU right now. 
And if you think there would be no wars without the EU because reasons you're just wishful thinking. Pretty much every generation until WWII had to go through a war. Ignoring history will repeat it.

The real question is what do you do **after** you buy bitcoin. It you leave it on the exchange, you're doing it wrong. So what to do? Get a hardware wallet like Trezor and move the coins to it after you buy them. If you do this, then even coinbase could be used. However, because of past history and hostile behavior, I cannot recommend it. Use Kraken, or Gemini, or Cash App. The latter is the latest addition and the CEO (Twitter's Jack) is a big fan of bitcoin, not shitcoins. Goodl luck!!

You are mixing the product (futures) with the players (Wall St). Believe it or not, the reason you can buy bread/eggs/pork chops/gas/... at a relatively stable price is because of futures AND all the *speculators* that use them. It's also how many businesses can remain in business when the market goes against them.
The reason is that producers can sell their product *knowing what the price will be*, so without having to worry about price fluctuations. If a farmer produced, say, wheat for the entire year and then the prices collapsed because the crop was particularly good, they'd go bust. Instead, they lock in the price in advance and can continue to be in business, and you can buy bread at a stable price.
If shale gas producers in the US stayed in business when oil went $100 --&gt; $50 is because of futures. They sold oil forward for 2 yrs, which gave them *A LOT* of breathing room as they were still selling oil at $100 when the market price was $50, and could do that for 2yrs. In the mean time oil recovered significantly and they now continue to be in business, even if at a much lower profit.
Same logic applies to Bitcoin. Miners can hedge their profits by selling future, so they are guaranteed a known profit. Makes it much easier to run a business if you can plan ahead.  This guarantees miners won't disappear if the price tanks. Not only that, it allows businesses to emerge and take the volatility away from the merchant *without* selling the coins.

This is incorrect. Once you receive coins, the old UTXOs are no longer relevant. In fact, they are.no longer UTXOs because the coins have been spent, and sent to you. Your address is, on the other hand, the new UTXO, until you spend the coins. So if OP received coins to the same address, that's the same UTXO, so when it comes to spend them, there's only one input in both cases. Hence same fees.

No, this is bullshit. Lies, propaganda of Ver/Wright making, to steal the name. 


And you are indeed unaware of the history, but feel entitled to talk about it as if you did. I'll help you out and bridge the gap. Satoshi worked on the **code** for ~two years BEFORE he released the whitepaper. Go read his replies to Hal on the subject. That's because Bitcoin was born as **CODE**, not a fucking idea. The idea was well alive for 30+ years, with various attempts at creating digital cash. Not only that, Satoshi explicitly says that he had to build the whole thing **BEFORE** he could convince himself that it could actually work. CODE, not ideas/words/discussions. CODE.
So in a most categorical sense, Btcoin is **NOT** an idea. Bitcoin is code with very specific consensus rules, and those consensus rules are alive and well today. There was no break in the consensus rules since inception for Bitcoin. All the scam coins pretending to be Bitcoin, on the other hand, did break the consensus rules.

I work in finance and I think you don't know what you're talking about. Problem is, I'd need to write a book to counter your post - super short, but extremely high density of BS.
It's very convenient to blame banks for everything, but we need to realise that time is over. Note I didn't say banks have no sins, I just said they're not responsible for everything. For example, nobody is forcing the US government to spend way over the tax receipts. And the same applies to others, no bank on earth is forcing governments to run a deficit. Most do, but some don't. Blaming banks is like blaming cake bakers for fat kids.
And the second part is even worse, that Germany uses this as a weapon. Unless you want to claim that the person or entity being helped should dictate the terms of that help, it's the creditor that will dictate the terms. Always was, always will be. It so happens that Italy spends too much, or Greece at that, but Germany doesn't. So when the former need money, who is gonna step up? Inevitably those who have money, aka Germany. Or do you expect Italy to lend money to Greece??? And since Germany has the money, they will obviously have conditions attached, like absolutely everyone would. But for some reason, this totally normal thing must be some kind of.conspiracy by evil Germans and their banks.
It's pretty ironic that here we are preaching fiscal responsibility by being your own bank, hodling and running full nodes, but then completely fail to acknowledge that many problems arise precisely because of a lack of this kind of responsibility by the various players relying on the fiat system. No, it must be because conspiracy. smh

My thoughts on US gov attack in response to someone like Iran going full BTC for oil are different. By now it's quite well understood how Bitcoin works, and there's no way Iran would just go full BTC by blind hope. I'd bet they'd set up huge farms of their own miners. This would catch the US with their pants down as now you have to *double* all the existing hash rate to have a small hope to censor those txs.
Could happen, but there's two intertwined aspects which make it a lot more difficult than just "throwing money at it". First, the hash power to pull that off just doesn't exist. It has to be built, so it's not as easy as just sending a few warships to bring democracy to a dissenting rougue nation. The warships are ready to go at a fingersnap, miners need to be built.
The second part of the puzzle, making this a LOT more difficult, is the reaction from other players. The moment the US tries to build all those miners is the moment everyone else does it too. I am very skeptical that such an operation could be covert for long. The various intelligence agencies around the world would find out about it, guaranteed imo. Which would ultimately trigger a giant arms race to build miners. And in this arms race the US would be bound to lose because the interest to take the reserve money status out of the US' hands is something even close allies would be keen to do.
The end result is every nation state would mine it's own critical txs, which means ultimate competition for self interest. Total decentralization. (A cartel of nation state miners is just not credible imo.)
This is, in essence, how I see Bitcoin replacing the USD. Global mining competition between nation states.

Of course it's a valid comparison. A "hard fork" can be seen as "parting ways in the realm of blockchain". So America vs England is a more valid comparison than Pepsi vs Coca Cola because Pepsi never was Coca Cola, but America in origin was England.


There's truth in this sentence, but it's also not entirely relevant. The same logic applies to gold vs silver. If the entire world (hypothetical!) tomorrow decides to switch 'monikers' gold &lt;--&gt; silver, then yes, the yellow metal will be called silver. And the grey-ish metal will be called gold. Or if we all decide to call you "John Doe", that's what your name becomes for all practical purposes. Heck, we could even decide to call the country with most of the miners today Australia and call that big island down under China. Sure, why not.
See where I'm going with this? It is true that you can switch names, and if everyone does it than that's it. The point is, however, that this switch needs to have ***social consensus***, and calling Bitcoin Cash simply Bitcoin will never have social consensus. And this is regardless of the BCH value.

Death is a very real possibility, though I see space for something else. From what I've been able to understand about him, he was bloody paranoid. Use a pseudonym, never reveal anything about himself, possibly scrambling writing style to avoid being identified via word patter recognition (if it was a single individual, that is) and then some. He also disappeared more or less at the same time Gavin Andresen started talking to the CIA.
So what's going on? Let's say you want to kill ETH. What do you do? You go after Vitalik. Character assassination and similar "digital era warfare". And then you jail him for life. I think that's why Satoshi removed himself from the scene - Having a clear idea of how bitcoin would rub a good few people wrong, he didn't want to be the lightning rod attracting the fury of any government. And you cannot "kill" someone who is not around...

Upvoted... because you told me not to, and because there's nowhere near enough technical questions being asked anymore.
Edit: There's a lot of confusion ITT.... so reply to original question as well. You specifically mention two **addresses**. With this premis, the fees would be the same. That's because when you spend you'd only have one input in both cases, the specific address from which you are spending. If it was different wallets, with multiple addresses , it would be different.

You are confused, very confused. OP mentioned retail/commercial banks like BNP and others like it. These banks have very little to do with governments lending.
Then there's central banks. They also have very little to do, and if you don't understand that I can't help you in a Reddit post. Their main role is in printing money, which increases monetary supply and so devalues the money. But they don't give money directly to the government. The gov will borrow that same money, just like everyone else.
So how does the government borrow? Bonds. Governments issue bonds and sell them into the financial markets. It's not banks that lend money to governments, it's asset managers. Those same asset managers that promise to give.you a pension when you retire. (This is simplifying a bit, but the overall picture is correct.) And since you pay money into those asset managers, **you** lend money to the government. Yeah, that's right... we are the ultimate lenders to governments. And not even through banks!
 And what's the role of banks? Very little, in fact. At least of commercial banks as you know them. Wall Street has a lot more to do, but that's another story. But you're right, banks do lend as much as they can, that's their business. Would you blame a baker for.selling all the cakes and bread she makes? And banks are the same, they run as much business as they can. 
I'm long bitcoin, and have been for longer than most, but understanding how banks work and what their role is is still key. Things will change with bitcoin, but most people don't really get how. Topic for another post.
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:57:46
What an idiot...
If you're referring to market cap, that is a most flawed metric and I have to explain why,then you're dumber than I expected. Another thing you should also consider, the market cap share of bitcoin was ~34% in Dec 2017 during ATH. You should rethink about your OP and how it adds up with this. And last comment, bitocin was always miles ahead of every other shitcoin out there if you consider real economic activity and value transfer. 
All in all it seems like shitcoiners of your ilk are in for a rude awakening when the shitcoin of the day dies off.

Life pro tip: Don't throw money away.
If the fees are too high, it's plain old dumb to insist on paying them. It's like paying and  complaining about FedEx's fees when you've got cheaper alternatives... Use them. Once the L2 solutions are live, then you can start using those.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:33:08
Re 51% attack, that is correct. And it's also true that SegWit disables the ASICBoost feature of Antminers, but BCH does not.
On the technical stuff... BCH is stuck at the stage Bitcoin was in Summer - It's a clone from then. Core devs are working on BTC every day (!!) whilst BCH has only a few devs, literally one or two. BTC is governed by consensus, which is the **fundamental** reason why changing BTC is difficult, whereas BCH is governed by... a few big players. 
BTC wants to scale off-chain (LN, sidechains), BCH wants to scale on-chain with humongous blocks (every soda&amp;bubble gum purchase you ever make will **for ever** be recorded on the blockchain).
BTC is optimizing block space use (SegWit, Schnorr, MAST), BCH... wants bigger blocks.
BTC has satellites streaming the blockchain (yes, for real... Google it!), BCH has... bigger blocks.
BTC has privacy solution being worked on as we type, BCH has... bigger blocks.
For now, BCH has lower fees, but that's largely because not very many people are using it. BTC has the LN coming in the not too distant future, and RSK launching on 12/4... In case you don't know this, RSK "extends" Bitcoin by providing smart contract contract capabilities on par with Ethereum, and tx speeds of up to 2000 txs/s at extremely low fees. With a 1-to-1 peg to the bitcoin blockchain, so no new coins are minted/created and it can be used to send coins around.
In short, BTC has one hellova lot of devs working on all sorts of technical improvements, and BCH has big blocks, which to them it seems to solve every single problem on Earth because "low fees". The high fees in Bitcoin are temporary, BCH's slow development and lack of innovation seems permanent. (But I'll give it to them, this may change if enough devs step up.)

I wish there was no more high fees FUD, but I'm afraid it'll continue to exist... It's basically the only reason of existing for Roger&amp;Co. Someone rightly said miners could pay us $1 for each txs, and the fees would still be too high. Oh well.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:42:49
It is out of nowhere, and it is also not out of nowhere.
First, hope you understand how a hard fork leads to "new coins", which come "out of nothing". Keep in mind, Bitcoin comes "out of nothing", so this should not be too surprising.
But the money you receive is not out of nothing... the money you receive comes from other people who are **willingly** trading their BTC for the new coin. Why would they do that? Because they have a different world view from yours... they are not saints, or benefactors. They just think that the new coin will rise in value and they can profit from it. Maybe they really believe in the new coin, like many Bcash supporters do. Or maybe people are just speculating - Say you buy B2X, hope for a pump, make 10%-100% by selling to the late-comers, who are left holding the bag. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:55:58
It's not a falsehood... BCH is just NOT Bitcoin. 
If we agree that the Bitcoin of 2016 was THE Bitcoin, and I really hope we do agree on that, and then ask *which coin today is compatible with THE Bitcoin*, there is only one answer, and that is **NOT** BCH. So yeah, BCH is a Bitcoin clone, may have it's uses, and there's no reason it wouldn't exist, but it's not Bitcoin.
The problem is born when people start claiming it is Bitcoin... especially if done in a way to confuse people, like Roger is doing.

This is a fallacy, and one that we like around here because we say "1BTC = 1BTC", but it's a fallacy notheless. The guy who paid $10k for the car lost $9,999. If he goes to a bank and asks for a loan and the bank asks for available collateral to pledge against the loan, they will not say
"Ah, you have a car, which is a car, so here's the loan for $10k".
What they will say is "No good, your total assets are $1, so no loan." Go tell that guy he didn't lose anything after he's been rejected for the loan.
That explains $9,999. What about the remaining $9,999? You lost them. When the first buyer got a car off your hands, your head was processing a nice profit based on the $20k market cap. Now you only got $1 for the next car.
Market losses are real losses. In a bull market, it makes sense to say "HODL!", which is what bitcoin is. But in a declining market, it doesn't. History is full of people who held stocks of declining companies because "I didn't lose anything, I still have my stocks!" AND LOST generational wealth. Go tell those (ex old-money) families that they didn't lose anything when the companies they owned went bust, because they still have the stock.

I know... but that's the point. The discussion is on how to scale cryptos in general, and BTC specifically. The current buzz is all about bitcoin, so whether you agree with it or not, it's a safe bet to say  BTC will be the first one to experience the rapid growth in user base. A 100x increase in txs volume would make the blocks 100MB, which is FAR from global adoption, yet it already makes running a node prohibitively expensive.

And for your own benefit, use BTCPayServer so you don't end up paying % fees to BitPay or others like them. And then hook it up to some exchange so you pay minimal fees to convert to fiat. And decided if you want to convert it all to fiat or if you wanna keep some of it in bitcoin.

Problem is it's very easy to sit behind a monitor and type 
"*If you don't prove it, it ain't real.*"
"*References, or it's false*"
or any other "pseudo intelligent" claim that demands some sort of proof from the poster.
"Prove to me that you're not a thief."
See? Just did it. That does not mean you should start collecting all sorts of papers, scan them and post them online to convince me, does it?
I am more than happy to explain things to people over the Internet, but I do expect you to "help yourself" a bit as well. One, don't use a patronising tone when you really have no idea about what you're talking about. If you start by attacking me, I will become the biggest dick you have ever seen, exposing your stupidity and/or ignorance. But if you say "Hey, can you give me more info... interested in learning more.", that's a whole different story. A patronising tone is also a simple way to troll, and my reply against trolls is always pretty vigorous.
The other guy was behaving like an absolute troll, and hence I went against him like you do with a troll. You were a bit better, but had a very patronising tone as well... so I responded accordingly. Look, as soon as you changed your approach, I am talking to you like a normal human being. Let's try to have civilised conversations.

You sound like someone who's watching "The Kaiser Report" and reading Zerohedge a bit too much, but not really trading.
I bought the dip, more than once. It's gut wrenching, to buy and see the price going down and down and down. Yes, with Bitcoin I've always come out on top. But it was not at all obvious. I've also hodled from 2014 to now, and more than once in my mind I've written that money off - "Fuck it, it was a gamble and it didn't pay off". Anybody who claims they were mighty happy to hodl bitcoin, without the shred of a doubt, during 2014-2017 is probably rationalizing.
I am also describing the average investor. And just by reading your comment, that's exactly what you are. Not the least from your final comment, which is telling me you've got money locked up, doing nothing, waiting for the "bitcoin crash lottery", instead of investing it.

Ummm.... yes there is. You get the money across the world in 10min, sitting from your sofa instead of having to take your ass to WU. Or having to register on their website and provide a ton of info. Did you miss the part of bitcoin where you can send money without asking for permission from anyone? Worth paying more than WU just for that, IMO. And yet it costs less.

Bcash *could* be a valid altcoin, **IF** they didn't try to mess with Bitcoin. As is, it's an attempt to steal Bitcoin's name, see also one of the top posts currently on the front page, basically an attack on Bitcoin.
Will it survive? Most likely, there's plenty of strong supporters. But to have a viable long term future they will need to beef up the dev 'team' (i.e. on or two guys now) and address their centralization problem. By running larger and larger blocks, you make it more and more expensive to run a full node, which creates centralization. And if only businesses can run a full node, than it's not all that difficult to shut it down.

Market size has got nothing to do with arbitrage opportunities. So long as I can access bitcoin and futures, I can arbitrage the price differences away. People **will** arbitrage the price differences if they'll have all the required tools, and futures are one of them. The point is, if people buy a lot of futures, people will buy the underlying and drive the price up. If people sell many futures, similarly people will sell their coins and drive the price down.
On another note, futures allow banks to hedge their books. We like to say "1BTC = 1BTC", but banks that need to do accounting in fiat don't see it that way. If BTC is down 30% at the end of the quarter, they will need to report a corresponding loss. With futures, on the other hand, they can hedge their books. This allows them to carry bitcoin on inventory, which are available for their clients to buy/sell.

"*What kind of insane person would build agricultural grade explosives in his home???*"
That's why we have the law. And that nothing bad really happened, like him ending up injuring someone, doesn't matter. Laws are designed also to prevent, not just to punish.
Again, you may disagree with the law, and that's totally fine. But once the law has been written, that's it, at least for the time being. And those laws have been written by people who spent a lot more time thinking about them than the two of us combined times ten, so we really need to accept that maybe we don't get the full picture.

No, this is bullshit. Lies, propaganda of Ver/Wright making, to steal the name. 


And you are indeed unaware of the history, but feel entitled to talk about it as if you did. I'll help you out and bridge the gap. Satoshi worked on the **code** for ~two years BEFORE he released the whitepaper. Go read his replies to Hal on the subject. That's because Bitcoin was born as **CODE**, not a fucking idea. The idea was well alive for 30+ years, with various attempts at creating digital cash. Not only that, Satoshi explicitly says that he had to build the whole thing **BEFORE** he could convince himself that it could actually work. CODE, not ideas/words/discussions. CODE.
So in a most categorical sense, Btcoin is **NOT** an idea. Bitcoin is code with very specific consensus rules, and those consensus rules are alive and well today. There was no break in the consensus rules since inception for Bitcoin. All the scam coins pretending to be Bitcoin, on the other hand, did break the consensus rules.

In a blockchain you can execute a hard fork at any time. If you do, you are basically creating a new coin, and the initial state of that coin is a snapshot of the chain your forked at the time your forked. In other words, if you own one coin on chain A, you will own one coin on chain B which forked from chain A.
As for every security, there will likely be a market for it. The "airdrop" comes because some people believe coin B will appreciate and they can make a profit from it. Others think it's destined to the gutter, and will sell ASAP.
There's no free lunch, someone is buying those new coins. They do it not because they're benefactors, but because they think they can profit from it.

Agree 100% with this. Most, if not all, here understand that bigger blocks are inevitable, but there are other priorities now. Specifically, instead of increasing the block size, let's optimize the block space available right now - SegWit does that, Schnorr will do that, Simplicity (smart contract language proposal by... Blockstream) could add a bit here, and MAST should help as well, though I'm unsure about the latter.
Once we optimize the current space use, then it will be the time to start enlarging the blocks. And we'll also hopefully have info from L2 requirements to help guide the conversation.
Bigger blocks will be necessary, but it's not the thing to do *now*, high txs fees notwithstanding.

The law is quite literally what underpins all of civilization.

FUD, in a very disguised form.
There are many things you mentioned that are correct, but you mix them up and draw incorrect conclusions. For instance that 1987 happened because of futures. This is false. Markets crash even without leverage, or without the ability to sell short. See housing market, before 2008. 
Leverage makes the market moves more severe, that's true, but is not in itself the cause.
Also not true that you need to buy in order to sell. Futures are contracts, and I can sell a futures with zero bitcoin owned. Zero. And that adds to the sell pressure.
Could go on for a lot more, but will stop here. Bitcoin will correct for sure, like it did in the past. But that won't be because of leverage.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:21:54
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:20:43


Exactly! So why insist on using it? 
I would love Bitcoin to be all of the above, and then some, but it currently isn't. I'll wait a bit more until L2 solutions come live, and RSK is set to launch on 12/4, and then start using those options. But right now reality is telling me plastic is very often more convenient to pay with than bitcoin. So I'll continue to use it.

@_date: 2017-11-25 14:49:25
Could this happen? Yes. Could the shorts get absolutely slaughtered? Hell yeah.
Price will decline if a majority of players decides to sell, which is far from clear. Sure, some believe it's overvalued and will short it. But there's also many other players who believe the price will go up, and will buy. Countering the shorts. Also, remember that shorting is intrinsically riskier than going long... long you lose your investment **ONLY**, short and your loss is theoretically unlimited.
Another point you miss is the margin people need to put up. You can't just short $1bn like that. CME requires 30% margin, so to short $1bn, you need to lock up $300m. From an insider, trust me that $300m is **A LOT OF MONEY FOR EVERYONE ON WALL ST**. This is cash to put up front, just so we're clear.
Finally, it was inevitable... it was always going to happen. The pie is way too big now. Nothing can be done about it.

Not true, or maybe you should be more clear about what you mean. The current price is actually very well explained by Metcalf's law.

CME doesn't buy, or sell, any futures. They simply set up a standardized contract that makes it clear to everyone what is it that they trade, and provides price clarity so the contract can be settled without dispute around price.
The buyers and sellers are investors of all sorts. And as someone else already pointed out, you need to set up a "margin" to begin the trading... say $1,000. If the market gets against you (depends on which side of the trade you entered), CME will take $$$ from you and give it to the other party. If the market will go strongly against you, you'll get a "margin call" - Either put up more money, if you believe strongly in the trade, or close the position. When you close it'll be around $1,000, a bit more, or a bit less. If more, you'll need to make the addition payment... but even in case you didn't, CME could cover that and go after you to get their $$$ back.

@_date: 2019-02-26 17:50:24
This is very likely a correct statement, but what it misses out is the final distribution of coins based on the value they capture. So let's make some guesses. 
Assuming an 80/20 type of distribution seems very sensible. Means "20% of the coins will capture 80% of the value". Do you think there will be "1000 dominant coins", meaning that they will be actively used regularly? I highly doubt that. Today monetary borders are imposed with force and there's less than 200 currencies in the world. But there's still only one gold. And a handful of other precious metals that act as inflation hedge/store of value.
If you assume some ~20 coins being used (somewhat) regularly, this gives you ~4 coins capturing ~80% of total value. And if you then push further the analogy with gold, you can very reasonably guess there's gonna be 1 dominant coin capturing most of the value, and another ~19 coins with random uses here and there. 
You can guess which will be the dominant coin, I know I have my chips stacked accordingly.

I don't knwo what will happen in the future, no crystal ball here. So it's entirely possible, and actually also likely, that things will get uglier before they get better. Bitcoin use is increasing, real user demand that is, so the tx requirements on that blockchain are increasing. But do not confuse "growing pains" with a "genetic condition". Many (most?) cryptos out there have a proper genetic condition. Others just don't have the brainpower behind it that would make it scale properly. But the bitcoin future looks very bright... just remember that "future" is yes tomorrow and in a month from now, but it's also in a year from now. In a year, many of the L2 scaling solutions will have been developed, and a new era of exponential growing will (likely) have begun with tiny fees. In my opinion that's when you'll see bitcoin re-take the un-disputed role as king again, in the form of the giant majority of market cap.
I think of all these attacks as a necessary rite of passage. I cannot guarantee none of them will succeed, but I sure as hell know there's a lot of people here who will put up one hellova fight.

It seems these guys are really scammers... but on a more generic note, this is exactly how AML/KYC works. If you say you are going to have volumes up to $100k/day in your business, a large tx will trigger flags. Got nothing to do with cryptos or anything, it would happen with any business account.
Good luck with getting your money back. But in the future, keep this in mind - As you grow, you need to give a heads up to your counterparties that you are growing so no one can pull shit like this on you. Especially anyone related to money, fiat or crypto.

Ignore the FUD... there's only one Bitcoin chain, where both legacy and SegWit transactions are valid. If you have your coins in SegWit addresses, you're good. That was the beauty of SegWit, it was possible to do it via soft-fork, i.e. **full backwards compatibility**.
1. Legacy addresses start with 1, SegWith addresses start with 3
2. You don't worry about it because of full backwards compatibility
3. No
4. Yes... but why would you? To pay more in fees? Also, there is no "conversion", just moving coins **on the same chain** to a different address.
5. Doesn't matter.

No it's not. Proof has a very well defined meaning, and we cannot just throw it around in the same way we disagree about what's tastier, peaches or strawberries. 
Going around with statements like OP's and yours will easily result in people putting money in shitty investments (not the case with bitcoin, imo) because there was "proof" that it would only keep making money. Once you're dirt poor because you over-invested and it went badly, you won't be poor "in the eye of the beholder", you'll just be poor, period.

Breaking news... Bitcoin is not yet ready for mass adoption. It's still early days, and if you're getting into a new tech, it's your responsibility to learn about it.

They get a lot in return from those taxes, from health to benefits, great public schools and then some. (Don't know what's the situation now, but in the past the Swedish would actually get a few hundred EUR per month to go to university, instead of paying tuition fees!)

Not really... the relationship between futures price and underlying price is very tight because arbitrage arises otherwise. (People arbitrage away price inconsistencies, thus removing arbitrage.) This means that the price of the futures often **is** the price of the underlying, or a **very good approximation**. 
Let's say people buy tons of futures. The underlying will also go up because people will buy it to profit from the arbitrage opportunities. A similar story holds in reverse.
The overall trend for gold is down now, and that's mainly because people keep digging gold up from the ground... increasing supply. And demand is not going up, things are pretty calm in the world today, despite everything. So price declines.

You are confused, and confusing two different issues - One is "the law as is written", another one is "the law as it would be best for the current times". Julian Assange break the US laws. If he didn't, he would not be hiding abroad. This is a fact, not opinion.
Another question is whether I agree with the law, or whether I think the law is appropriate, or whether I think Assange is the same as Bin Laden and so on. I don't. But this is a different discussion to be had. In the 20ies alcohol was prohibited... and you would end up in jail for consuming it, there was no debate. Today it's free to consume. The law changed. And I'm all for reviewing/updating/changing the laws, but we cannot ignore the current state of affairs. If you break the law, you go to jail. Period. (In principle, at least.)

Are you really that fucking stupid or what? Copying your post, in case you decide to remove the display of stupidity. But I'll answer anyway.
I picked a random txs from about 18 months ago, you can see all the details [here](
Look at the fee... BTC 0.006. How did we get there? The tx size is 4119 bytes, and the fee was 14.567sat/b. In Jan 2016, when this tx was sent, 
BTC 0.006 ~ $0.23, 
and the price for 1 BTC was ~$383. 
How much would that transaction cost today? In BTC terms it would still be the exact same cost, BTC 0.0006. And how much is this today??? Hmmm... maths tells me that this is
 0.0006 * 7,200 = $4.32
What is that, your mind blowing up??? Good job it "literally makes no fucking sense".
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:42:37
Stop the shilling. And learn how to set your own fees.
With miners very unlikely to leave in droves, as it happened two weeks ago, the txs get processed steadily. 30sat/b txs are being cleared regularly now and have been for several days.
And just like a single super mega cheap txs is not the whole story, neither is a super mega expensive txs paid by someone with no fucking clue about what they're doing. Or worse, trying to drive an agenda.

A difference of opinion is fine, blindly insisting on a contentious fork which looks a lot like it has been designed to hurt bitcoin is a different story. Also, in case you missed the posts on the front page, the NYA camp is clearly colluding to manipulate the market to, again, cause as much damage as possible to those with a "different opinion". And unless he comes out condemning this kind of behaviour, he's complicit. 
Different opinion? You can hard fork whenever you want, perfectly fine... we can be friends and have drinks together. Orchestrating an attack is not "difference of opinion".

You see? Keep displaying your stupidity. Your inexperience. Your arrogance.
Since you're just a little arrogant baby, let me explain this in simpler terms. One is a legislation, which provides guidelines at a high level. Another thing is **how you enact** that legislation. And that requires understanding what "suspicious" behaviour is. As it turns out, "unexpected large" transactions are one example of "suspicious" behaviour, which is why companies monitor that. It's not the only one though. 
Have a look at [this paper]( page 11. It explicitly discusses algorithms for "outlier detection". In case you are wondering "outlier" to what? One example is txs size.
Please keep posting. I fucking love exposing stupidity.

Not only it's not "very speculative", it's actually very reasonable to assume so. Miners have **real costs** to sustain - electricity, labour, rent,... They need to sell their coins to pay for these costs. 


Hashing power won't leave, certainly not at the rate of signaling.
Think it costs &gt;$1k to mine a bitcoin, at current prices, B2X barely covers the cost of mining it.
An attacker needs to have very deep pockets to launch a sustained attack.  Not many do.

Absolutely not, if there's a cap on the reserves. The fractional reserve acts as a multiplier, it's 100 at the system level for an imposed 10% reserves, but cannot go above that. Only with no reserve requirements can the debt printing spiral out of control, otherwise it remains limited.

What you're experiencing is becoming the standard for exchanges, so any other exchange would be pretty much the same. My personal favorite is bitstamp, but I think even they are pretty invasive nowadays.
You should expect this to get worse rather than better.
If you want to avoid all of this, bisq is the way to go. Or hodlhodl. Both are decentralized exchanges, but bisq is preferred. Buy/sell bitcoin, no questions asked. The problem with that is that it's not as user friendly and you need to know what you're doing. So maybe not the best for a new bitcoiner.
Good luck and welcome!

This is everywhere the case? Banks must hold a certain amount of cash, regulations impose that. And that's the case all over the world precisely because we have learned, over many a bank run, that without enough reserves banks go under very fast.

The block size increase will come, but it won't come *now*. Also, an block size increase requires a hard fork, which becomes increasingly more difficult to pull off as the network grows - Absolutely everyone needs to do it or be left behind. So if we need to do a hard fork, it makes more sense to build in some sort of dynamic block size increase, so we don't need to do it every two years - That's a recipe for disaster.

Futures have a fairly important role in maintaining price stability. The reason for cattle/grain/coffee/... futures is not "because they are difficult to trade", but simply because producers like to hedge their exposure to price fluctuations. Lock in the price today, so you know what your profit will be over the year. In some cases, futures allowed shale producers to literally survive when oil tanked from ~$100 to ~$50 as they had hedges in place for up to two years.
Also, the big banks need to hedge their books if they want to set up a bitcoin trading desk. Futures do that.

Not the easiest thing to do... Depending on how you want to do it, you need "frictionless" access to 
1. Futures market
2. Bitcoin market
3. Cash market
If you have "a lot" of money, you only need 1. and 2. If you have "little money", you'll need all three. 
Let's say you've got  "a lot of money", then you buy a stash of bitcoin up front and buy/sell as I described in the OP. (You'll also need to consider the margin required for the futures trading.) If you've got "little money", then you need 3. as well so you can borrow money to buy the stash of bitcoin, and then play as above.
Frictionless means "zero cost to trade and/or to transfer money around". That's never the case, but you want it as cheap as possible. The main reason is because these costs eat into the arbitrage profit. (That's what I mean in OP when I say "the maths changes a bit", you need to account for the transaction and trading costs.) 
I suggest you work out on paper an example of how it would work in practice, including trading costs: Say a Bitcoin trade costs you 0.25%, and the futures trade is for free. Then even if *futures = spot*(1+0.24%)*, you are losing money
In reality a futures transaction will also cost something, quite possibly $10 only. And then consider moving money to the various accounts. And if you borrow money, you need to factor in that, too.
These practical limitations are why the arbitrage I described is often limited to the big boys only (Wall St).

You're clearly uninformed about all of this. Deposit taking banks don't do rehypothecation. They lend the money out, and there's a clear claim on assets. There is no claim on money by multiple parties.
Rehypothecation happens with securities, not money. And yes, it's a problem, but nothing to do with fractional reserves. Wall St shop has $100 and buys US treasuries. Then they lend them out for a return. The new shop does the same, etc. At some point the trail is lost/broken because of accounting rules. That's rehypothecation, and how it happens. Nothing to do with fractional reserve and retail customers.
Also throwing out "by definition" makes it sound important and intelligent, but it's most often just empty words. There is no definition on that.

Of course they do, and not just by the thousands, more like by the tens of thousands.

Shameless plug - another explanation [here.](
@_date: 2019-12-24 16:11:31




Well, there's no widespread bail ins now. And in most developed nations deposits up to a certain amount are guaranteed/insured. This covers most deposits and depositors, regardless of bail-ins.
But let's go further. The bank *does* make you aware of this, in the T&amp;C you sign when you open an account. An institution that just takes your deposit to keep it in a vault is a... a safe, not a bank. And will charge you for it, since keeping $ secure has a cost. Maybe you are happy with it, but most people expect some kind of return. But there can be no return without risk... which is why banks exist. They take your money as a liability to them, i.e. you lend the money to them with promise to repay on request. And if you lend them too much money, you would be participating in a bail-in.
Lastly, bail-ins are typically reserved/meant for the really big creditors, like bond holders. Me and you are small potatoes, and protected by insurance at that. Bond holders are different, and they should feel the pain if the bank goes down. But we treat equity and debt as fundamentally different, which makes it tricky. So bail-ins are the right thing to do - Hold debt, but if shit hits the fan you fo down, like shareholders. No taxpayers bailouts.

You bcashers are seriously off your depth when it comes to bitcoin, and this just proves  it. If you understood the fundamental problem of bitcoin you'd know this is a stupid claim, as stupid as it gets. And the fundamental problem in bitcoin is that 
**THERE IS NO UNIVERSALLY FIRST SEEN TRANSACTIONS IN A DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM**
Why? Einstein special relativity. Yes, we need to bother Einstein. Because signals don't propagate instantaneously on the internet, when you send two transactions, different nodes will receive them in **DIFFERENT ORDER**. This is a fact of life, and the reason why Bitcoin has been called a "time stamping server". Put differently, "first seen" is absolutely meaningless in a distributed sense. So the first seen rule is worth zero, and it's also certainly not enforced by miners... as  can demonstrate. (bcash being happily double spent...) 
So bitcoin always required a solution like RBF because 0-conf is not safe, can be double spent, and "first seen" means nothing.

The network is will check point specific blocks so it cannot be reorged below that specific block. To defend themselves from bcashsv, bcashabc introduced checkpoints every 10 blocks. Sounds like a great idea, but it's not as, ironically, increases the chance of a split. Think about two blocks hitting nodes right on that 10th checkpointing block height - which one is the "correct"? Half the network may go with one, half with the other, and you have a split.

The restaurant can reprint the menu from one week to another. Same principle applies, just different time scale.
Stick with the restaurant analogy and assume that for whatever reason there's only one restaurant available. You can still get your food, just (generally) not in the restaurant, but with take out. And when you want to treat yourself, you go dine in.
Same with bitcoin. You want unbeatable security and censorship resistance? That's not cheap, it shouldn't be... there's no reason why a property that money never had in the history of humanity would be cheap. So you pay for it. You want cheap transactions? You order "takeout"... you transact off-chain.
For some reason people totally understand that there's different levels of service, with various compromises, in every single market known to humans, but for money this shouldn't be the case. For some reason people will laugh (rightly so) in your face if you say that you want a "tank security formula 1", but then be extremely serious in arguing that for money tank-level security should come with formula 1 performance and speed. And smart contracts on top.... so flying. And "censorship resistant micro blogging". So sailing. Basically, when it comes to bitcoin some people find it perfectly "reasonable" to ask for a "tank that performs as a formula one, and can also fly and sail".

Just beware of the consequences... banks will **charge** money for demand deposits, because security has a cost.
Which will drive most of the money into time deposits, because you not only you don't pay, but you get paid! And then you're back where you started - Only a small fraction of all the deposits is held in a vault.
Which is, effectively equivalent, to signing a piece of paper where you agree that only, say, 10% of your deposit will be in vaults and the rest is for the bank to do as it pleases.
Which, finally, is equivalent to a regulator requiring 10% of money in a vault and the rest as the bank pleases.
People often talk about full reserves, but the situation is really much more complex than just "Put all my money in vaults!!!".

If I have to spend $5 and pay $5 in fee using bitcoin, I'll just use cash or plastic. For larger txs, I'll use bitcoin. This is the reality right now, and complaining doesn't achieve anything.

I feel your frustration, and I know where you're coming from. At the same time, I have to say something which will not be very popular... the derivatives markets on their own do not cause "price distortions". To the contrary, it is the futures and options markets that give us all the price stability we enjoy in every day life. If we only had a spot price for, say, wheat, we'd have periods of wheat shortage and periods of rotting wheat.
It's a really long story to tell, and I don't want to write walls of text. I can only point to the fact that options existed at least since the Greeks were around - Don't remember which philosopher made a killing by buying options on olive oil mills use back then. I'll tell you more. When oil went from $100 to $50, it was futures that allowed many shale producers to remain in business, and survive, because they sold 2yrs into the future, at $100. (You can argue it'd be better if they were wiped out because of pollution, but that's a different story. I'm simply pointing out that futures markets allowed businesses to survive, and with them many families.) 
The problems happen when people start ignoring the fundamentals of business. That's when derivatives, in general, make the crashes bigger and stronger. In 2008 it wasn't Wall St that caused the crash, as controversial as it may sound, it was **retail banks** lending money to people with absolutely no credibility. Google for "Ninja Mortgages"... they were called so because they were loans to people with **N**o **I**income **N**o **J**ob. Wall St doesn't originate mortgages, they "repackage" those mortgages and give them to investors. That's why Wall St got in trouble, for "misleading" investors, not for causing the problem. And here derivatives made the crash worse, but again not the cause. As usual the cause for the crash was human irrational exuberance, which on this occasion made people believe that house prices could only go up.
Bottom line... it's impossible to keep the big boys out of the game. We've had 9yrs of peace (and ridicule). Now Bitcoin is too big to ignore. And this will arguably reveal the "true" price, a price based on a global demand, not just what a bunch of underground nerds/geeks want.

Again you demonstrate you don't know what you're talking about. You keep mixing different things and don't understand any.
Even IF the exchange were to have less coins than those deposited, the "missing" coins must be **somewhere**! Either they lent it to someone, or they stole it or whatever. But they **absolutely cannot** get a Y excess of coins out of thin air. Even less so "cannot be found on chain yet" - They will NEVER be found on chain because excess coins don't exist. They cannot exist.
Once again, STFU. You don't know anything about any of this stuff - bitcoin, banks, fractional reserve, etc.... Stop talking and learn something first.
You are indeed an absolute muppet.

bcash **IS** a scam. Not because they forked, not because they want big blockz, but simply because they have been relentlessly attacking bitcoin and promoting bcash as "the real bitcoin". That's a scam, no other way to put it. If I sell you brass as "the real gold", that's a scam, and so is selling bcahs as bitcoin.
But ironically, I **never** said bcash is a scam in rbtc. I insisted on debunking their shit, of which there is about three million metric tons, as much as I could. And I was being forward and direct, nothing less. 


Sure, if debunking falsehoods is propaganda, then I'm guilty as charged. I invite you to scroll through my post history and find this propaganda.


Right.. it's so exciting the market has punished holders pretty badly. And it's so exciting that without the "real bitcoin" it would be barely acknowledged for it's existence.

Yes and no. If you convince enough people that "Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin" that's what they'll buy and that's what will rise to prominence.

Analogies are, generally speaking, always "contrived". But they can be very useful to convey the key point. And I think I was able to communicate the key point because 


goes right to the heart of the matter. 
No, you cannot have the cake and eat it too. 
This is not a matter of disagreement, "I prefer bananas, you prefer strawberries" where I have banana bread and you have a strawberry trifle. It's down to real life, physical limitations. And this has also been formalized as a theorem, the "DCS Theorem" which presents a blockchain trilemma. If you start with the Decentralization-Consensus-Scale triangle, in a blockchain you can only have *two* properties, but never all three. You can have D+C, but not scale. That's basically bitcoin. Then you can have C+S, but it won't be decentralized. That's a bank. Finally you can have D+S, but you won't have consensus.  And that is... the LN. It is decentralized, it can have scale, but there is no **global** consensus - Only within small groups everyone know how much everyone owns.
You can find the paper [here](
Tell me this. Do you really believe that Blockstream controls Bitcoin? Do you really think that we can have the cake and eat it too, and then Blockstream coerced and brainwashed everyone, and KEEPS everyone hyptnothized, because it's not enough to do it once - everyone must be under the continuous spell of Blockstream  - for them to carry out their evil plans. Do you really believe that the community at large would not want to have the cake and eat it too? Because that's the bcash narrative - Everyone, including let's say myself, is absolutely stupid and/or brainwashed by Blockstream, to see that we can have the cake and eat it too. Everyone except for a small group of visionaries, bcashers, who have seen the truth.
That's a lot of effort. To maintain everything under Blockstream's spell requires a LOT of effort, to control all these individuals. More effort than the US, because all these people are across the globe.
There's a simpler explanation, which doesn't require any effort at all, except debunking false narratives. And that is that we cannot have the cake and eat it too. If you accept this otherwise self-evident statement, you'll see that all the actions taken in Bitcoin are pretty normal. Or do you really think we love to pay $20 fees? Fuck it, I have too much money, let me throw some of that away. Really??
Nobody loves high fees, but it's a price worth paying to have the first ever decentralized money in the history of humanity. It's a tough pill to swallow, but it's inescapable.

@_date: 2019-04-04 13:42:36
You make a fundamental mistake in your reasoning, which is a mistake many bcash high profile "intellectuals" like Rick Falkvinge make: The assumption that if there's no incentive to do X, people won't do X. This is wrong, not just "in theory" but in practice and can be shown to be wrong outside of crypt. I'll get to an example in the end.
So what's the problem with that? It's not a matter of "incentives being big enough for people to do X", rather it is about "**dis**-incentives being small enough so people don't avoid doing it". What does that mean? Hypothetically... if it costs me $100/month to run a node and I make $200/month, I'll do it because there's a direct incentive to do it. If there's no incentive, and it still costs me $100/mo, I'll most likely NOT do it. And this is what you're thinking about. However... what if the monthly cost to run a node is... $5/month? You buy a full node because it's "cool", plug it in, and forget about it. Total cost, $5/month in electricity for a RasPi. Will you unplug it because "fuck that, I'm not wasting $5/month!"? Answer, most people in the developed world will not, because it's not a big deal.
The truth is that if the cost of running a node is small enough - what is small enough changes from individual to individual - you will not care and run it anyway. So the real question is not "Why would I run a node", but it becomes "Why not?".
The key here is that the cost of running a node must be small... and how do we achieve that? With "$20k nodes or piss off"? I think not. Truth is, you can achieve that by keeping the requirements to validate the network small. And big blocks don't keep those requirements small. Of course, it may require some more time, but imagine *every phone being pre-synced as a full node*. Why not? Connectivity, as bcashers always highlight, is getting better and cheaper by the year. And there already are people who run a full node on their phone. Not crazy to think that every phone might be a full node, even if limiting the bandwidth for it. Or a new PC/laptop... pre-installed with a full node. Syncs up as part of "new hardware setup", and then you're good to go. And so on.
As promised, an example of this behavior outside of crypto. In the US you can re-finance a mortgage at any time. Rational actors would take advantage of this as soon as the mortgage rates fall below your existent rate. For example, let's say you are paying 4% on your mortgage and rates go to 3.75%. A rational individual would immediately switch. In reality? Not the case. Analysis of actual (historical) re-financing shows that some people won't refinance no matter what, most will re-finance when the new rate is significantly lower than what they have, and only a tiny minority says "fuck it, I'm not paying more than I have to" and re-finance as soon as practically viable.
Another example, which applies more generally. Those annoying subscription services you sign up as a "trial" and then costs you $7/mo, or something. They make a fuckton of money because people just cannot be bothered canceling the subscriptions! (Of course, they try to make the cancellation as painful as possible, but that's another story.) You are probably paying for Netflix and Hulu and HBO, even though in practice you probably only watch Netflix &amp; Hulu. Or Hulu and HBO. Or whatever. And if that's not you, I'm sure you know some people for whom this is absolutely true. And yet, it doesn't matter... you/your friends don't/won't cancel the "extra" subscription. Because the cost is small.
To summarize, if the cost is small enough, people don't mind the cost, and this is true in general. You don't have to incentivize people to do something, just that the dis-incentives are not big enough to deter. In the case of Bitcoin you can start plugging full nodes on all kinds of hardware, and people will not mind running it because the cost will be small. 
(It's also not a question of **having** to run a node, but **being able to do so**, and not relying on others. Relying on others is... central banking 2.0.)

No, it's named Bitcoin Cash to confuse and scam people. It's also why "Bitcoin Core" came to be a favourite way to call bitcoin... "Cash or Core? Cash is Satoshi's vision, and the white paper, blah blah blah". Intentional propaganda to confuse.
If you were so convinced about the tech superiority (lol) you'd have no problems calling it bcash. It's easier to pronounce, by far. Superior tech wins, right? But you don't, because you know that without the name you've got nothing but a centralized shitcoin. (Checkpoints and all that?) And the hope that Jihan doesn't start unwinding his bags.

This is equivalent to saying "I don't care about distributed consensus".
And in fact, that's what you'll get... a centralized coin controlled by Roger and Jihan. If the new CEO doesn't dump all their bags.
As for double spending... all you need is to get a wallet that will automatically double spend after, say, 1min. Pay, walk out of shop, double spend automatically because the wallet does it for you. Nothing else is required. Then the question becomes what % of success you have, which means what is the % discount you get on everything you buy.

Except that an answer has been given to this problem, RBF, but you dismiss it as "awkward workaround" because you have no other argument.
The problem you describe is also nothing new to Bitcoin... if a restaurant becomes so immensely popular that people literally queue for hours just to get it, they will jack up the prices until the queue is a lot more manageable. There's only so much seating space in the restaurant (perfectly inelastic/fixed supply), and yet restaurants will only rarely enlarge the space to accommodate more people. You'll say "people go to other restaurants" to say "people go to other coins", which would make some sense in a different context, but money doesn't act like restaurants... one restaurant will never capture all, but one money will. Especially when most transactions will be offloaded off-chain. Think of a restaurant delivering... food comes to your home, the restaurant doesn't need to increase space.

Ever thought about the cost to
* Print the money and pay people to do it.
* Pay security so people at the printer's don't steal it
* Transport the money from the central printing machine to various states...
* ... which requires heavily armed personnel to protect it..
* ... and yet here and there someone will attack the value vans with all that goes with it
* Once in the state, transport it to every bank that needs it, again with heavily armed guards
* Banks paying to store it
* You paying to withdraw it (those shitty ATM fees?)
.. and only after all of this, you can finally use that cash "for free".
Bitcoin is digital cash, but nowhere did Satoshi ever mention "cheap transactions". Think about it until it sinks in.

In Gemini, find your way to buy bitcoin. Think it's one of the dropdown menus, something like "BUY -&gt; Bitcoin". At that point, from the "Order Type" menu select "Market". (If you don't want to trade, this is simplest.) Then enter $$$ you wanna spend and click "Buy".
At that point you should have coins in your account.
If you now want to spend those coins, you'll need to find a merchant that sells gear for Bitcoin. Once you do, and you select Bitcoin as payment option, they should present you with a QR code and/or a "bitcoin address" (a sequence of various characters, something like *3AEq5AgnqCsJo72WqxT92NfXvTVdbXv3p1*.) In Gemini, you then need to "Withdraw" BTC from the exchange, and you withdraw that *to the address provided by the merchant*. Basically you are asking Gemini to send the coins to the merchant. Once all the confirmations are done (2FA), the merchant should display something like "payment received", or so. Depending on the merchant, it may take up to 1hr for full confirmation. That's because on-chain payments always require a long wait time for security reasons.
Hope this helps. Feel free to reply and ask for more questions if not clear.

It's absolutely not a ridiculous thought, but unfortunately doesn't work. The truth is that even with ~4MB/block (effective disk space, not some fictitious limit with empty blocks) you are already outpacing Moore's law AND Nielsen's law. The latter is Moore's law for broadband.
Sounds crazy, huh? Do the math... calculate what you get with 4MB/block in a year. Hint: ~200GB of data. Current size of chain? ~220GB. So in one year you go + ~90% for chain size. Moore gives you ~60% CPU/yr and Nielsen gives you + ~50% broadband/yr. So you're already behind tech.
You may say 400GB is not a lot of space... but it was never about storage. It's about validation time, so CPU. (And I'm not even considering orphan rates etc. which depend on broadband.) Let's say it now takes you 6hrs to start your node from scratch and sync with the network. Next year it will be 9hrs, all considered. The year after will be ~7hr (assume same tech progress) and then eventually &lt; 6hrs in ~3yrs. And that's just by going to a shitty 4MB! It takes us three years to get back to where we are today (in terms of initial sync up) and we haven't scale at all. (4MB is not scale...) 
What if we keep increasing the block size as requirements grow? That's right, no home user will be able to sync up a full node.
And so you say only miners should run nodes? As false as it gets, but fine, let's play along. The above argument applies just as well. Identically, except that now we'll be talking about, say, ~GB blocks. At some point even huge miners will not be able to sync up from scratch, and so we're reducing the number of new miners AND relying on existing miners to maintain their infrastructure and NEVER crash. 
In short - Huge barriers to entry, and only a handful of people running the show. Does it sound like decentralized to you?

and others reading, this reply here is the kind of malicious post bcashers and other haters like to throw around a lot. Technically correct, and yet misleading. Even worse, this one goes further by correcting some other common fallacies, the NP-hardness and so on. 
So if it's technically correct, why is it misleading? Let's go in order.


This is very true and very misleading. Let me be more clear. In CS and maths, to "solve" a problem means something very specific. In mathematical terms you can pretty much write *any* problem as `F(x)=0`, i.e. you are looking for that `x` which puts your function `F` to zero. If you find an `x` that puts your function at 0.00000000000000000000001 you **did not solve** the problem. With this premise, it is true that LN routing is an unsolved problem - No one knows how to find that `x` which will *always* put the function to zero.
That doesn't matter. The real world is not a world of mathematical equations and exact solutions, it's a world where "it just works" is good enough. So if I find an `x` that makes my "routing function" equal 0.00000000000000000000001, **I have solved the problem for all practical purposes**. 
That's why claiming that "LN has unsolved routing" is misleading. We don't need to "solve" LN routing to make it perfectly usable. But that's something bcashers won't tell you, else *muh' low feeeeees* would fall apart instantly.


And this just confirms the suspicion... bitcoiners are keeping blocks small because we care about decentralization above everything else! Unlike centrally controlled coins with gigameg blocks, with demonstrable mid-tier "researchers" that like plagiarize others' work and push for unlimited blocks.

There isn't. Because there is no urgency, which was completely fabricated by the bcash scammers to sway markets in their favor. Guess what? the market has rejected that bullshit. 
It should also tell YOU that there is no problem with small blocks - If there was, the market would have figured this out and ditched Bitcoin in favor of some altcoin. Did. Not. Happen.


Nobody want your opinion, especially when it's filled with lies. One side understands perfectly well the compromises that are necessary to scale bitcoin. The "other" side talks about dying babies.

Tim Draper speaks as a billionaire, things are different for him. For him, a whole bunch of coins sitting in an underground vault in Switzerland might well be the thing to do, but for the rest of us? I don't think so.
Remember, money is just... money, has no utility on its own. So the short answer is "sell your coins for assets that are not useless on their own". Buy a house, if you need one. Or a car. Or a TV. Or a holiday. Or hookers and blow. Or whatever makes you enjoy life more. 
A Trezor with loads of coins in them is pretty sad thing, it's what those coins allow you to do that makes it all worthwhile.

It doesn't need to get "fixed/improved". That is the natural consequence of competition when the resources you are dealing with is scarce and precious - A market emerges. And block space is a scarce resource, there's only ~1.3MB/block of it available, no matter the demand. This naturally drives fees up as people compete for block space. OP already explained why increasing block size is a no-go, so not repeating that.

I would love for bcash to be delisted, but this seems like the most uphill battle. There's people who trade it and don't want it delisted. Don't think it's many, but in a bear market when trading is heavily subdued, and when all exchanges are struggling and/or closing doors, every trading fee penny helps. And Roger in this case has been behaving much better than faketoshi, at least on a superficial level. I know he's not much better, but that doesn't matter for exchanges. 
This effort will probably go like the lawsuit against bitcoin(dot)con - Some noise that goes up in smokes. Which only strengthens bcash. "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger" logic.

It's a subtle point. A node living on AWS for no reason whatsoever does nothing, that's true. But the power comes from "economic nodes", which you can think of as "full nodes with a human economic user behind". 
As a human user you should run a full node to validate all your transactions. Only you choose which software to run, which means you choose which rules you are happy with. And as economic player that choice is yours to make completely. Someone wants to fork to different rules? They better convince you to switch, or the change ain't happening. To be clear, the power comes from numbers... if everyone switches without you, you'll be alone. But if 51% want to switch? Tough shit, they can fork themselves off I'll stay right on the rules I want, together with the remaining 49%.
You can now see how "Sybil nodes" are pointless, they don't serve any economic purpose, but a real "human backed node" has all the power in the world.
@_date: 2019-04-05 12:22:09

This assumes "Satoshi-SPVs" exist, which they do not. Satoshi's SVPs are able to detect fraud, and this has been shown to not be possible unless you run a full node. Satoshi thought it might be possible, but it's not, at least so far no one was able to find out how to do it.
So until Satoshi SPVs are a reality, his dream of having "tons of transactions onchain" will remain a dream.

10 reorg or 1 reorg or 1000 reorg are *indistinguishable* at the protocol level. You cannot prevent any of them without introducing some degree of centralization.
If the 10 is rolling in bcash, then at every block they risk splitting the chain. Some miners mine on one block, others mine on other blocks, and there's no way to reconcile other than appeal to an oracle. AKA, centralized authority.
It also doesn't matter if miners can set it or not. Some miners will, some will not. Again you increase the risk of splitting the chain.

Again misleading. This is the malicious part, you keep making claims which are intended to mislead and spread FUD. You are not doing this out of a true desire to discuss, you are a simple FUDster.
Yes, routing will be very hard if you want to connect billions of devices and route between them. Nobody ever claimed the opposite. However here the unspoken assumption is that LN will be **the only** scaling solution, which is just not true. LN will be just part of the bitcoin scaling, but far from the only one. 
Will there be "LN hubs"? Absolutely! Why am I so certain? Because it's freaking permissionless. Nobody can stop bitcoin whales to set up a LN giant hub! But that's not a problem, because it won't be the only way to LN, since cost to entry will be low. Normal people will be able to set up a routing node, and contribute to decentralization. Because it will not cost much.
Scaling is not a magic pill tech that solves all the problems at once. It's true for centralized scaling, and it 10x much harder for **decentralized** scaling. Various solution, with various compromises, will contribute to scale bitcoin.


More FUDding please? Can I have some more? No, the tribalism was a consequence of the extreme attacks on bitcoin coming from all sides. From let's-put-everything-on-the-blockchain scammers, to "I wanna build a world computer EVM that does everything" ICO grand-daddy Vitalik, to low intelligence "researchers" like Peter Rizun and his masters Roger and Jihan, self professed Satoshi Nakamotos (all of them!!), pedophile billionaires, very-very-salty nocoiner academics, inverse-indicators TV hosts and so on. (The list is incredibly long.)
The only way to reject all of this is through tribalism, because there's no desire to discuss rationally. "Don't feed the trolls" necessarily becomes "Slay the trolls", which you can only do with tribalism.
You also demonstrate a clear lack of understanding of bitcoin if you don't get the reason why small blocks are key for its success.

A final word of caution: Roger is a snake oil salesman, and very convincing at that. But the technological reality is that you cannot scale on-chain and maintain decentralization. What bcashers are proposing is a bit like saying that to get a car to 200mph all you need to do is stick a rocket engine on a Model T. I'll let you draw the conclusion what would happen in that case.

It's not just the initial sync... at 512MB it all goes tits up for home users. One, after a few years you can never sync up from scratch. next, most nodes won't be able to simply keep up, as in *stay synced*. Remember, every node must validate the full block in a short time (see below why "short"), which means processing all the txs in the block. If it takes you &gt;10min to validate, you are falling out of sync. (Ask the honest ETH guys if this is an issue for them... it is.) And lastly the orphan rates would go through the roof, meaning there would be a lot more chain splits (even if temporary) than now which would naturally drive to further miner centralization. Point is, the download + validation + upload of the block must happen in a **very short** time compared to block time. Very short = not many seconds. One minute is too slow. This is so that every block is propagated through the network as quickly as possible so all miners are mining on top of the same chain. 
So... big blocks wreck the whole thing, big time. (Pun intended.)


I was just throwing out some numbers based on what I saw around here. In reality I suspect CPU will be the real bottleneck. If you run a full node on a Rasperry Pi and let it sync from scratch it will take you one month+ for the full sync. Can't say for you... all you need to do is try. And if running your PC is no go, which is understandable, consider getting a RasPi. You'll need to learn some Linux, but it's good fun!


What's downloaded is downloaded.. and more importantly validated!! So you'll pick up exactly where you left off. As I said above, if you want to run a full node, a RasPi is a great choice. You'll learn lots of new stuff (don't be intimidated!) and then you can leave it on 24/7. I even have my LN node on the same RasPi!!


No. You can "prune" your node and always only store, say, 10GB. All the older data gets deleted, but you're still up to speed.

Actually, he is asking us to support the 300kB proposal based on these numbers. His main argument has been that the number of full nodes has dropped significantly, from ~100k to ~50k, and he attributed this to the increased burden on full nodes. So if we're to believe his numbers, then the original conclusion (nodes down bc of burden) was inaccurate since the burden has only increased since then.
So yes, the burden of proof is on him, because the proposal is VERY contentious.

As expected, you are a bacasher. You don't know what you're talking about, are taking dumb videos to "explain stuff" as reference, and keep missing the point that there just is (essentially) no demand for cryptos today, which means there's plenty of time to develop the technology.
[Here]( you can read about statements like "routing is an unsolved problem". 
The TL;DR is that people who have never had to solve a real, practical problem in their lives will always criticize everything that is being built around them. If you did, you'd know that you *NEVER* solve a problem 100% for everything. Instead, you make various compromises which still give you a "good enough" outcome.
On chain payments... in case you missed it, Liquid is now live. That's an example of a sidechain which will take a lot of traffic off the main chain. Other side chains will emerge, all of which will relieve the main chain. LN itself provides tremendous relief. You are also missing that people are happily locking money into the LN, and plug and play LN nodes already exist, Google for the Casa LN node. more will come, and more and more funds will get locked into the LN. Which is being improved (at the protocol level) right now. And Schnorr + sig aggregation is cooking. Then channel factories. All of this will provide *huge* relief to the main chain. Once all of that is exhausted, and there's so much room to go it's untrue. After all of this is done, blocks can be increased. End result, fees will be high to sustain mining, but affordable, especially because as a private user you'll mainly use the LN only.
But why am I bothering explaining all this? Religious zealots are irrational by definition. Add an unhealthy dose of conspiracy, and you'll find banksters/AXA/Rotschild/Bilderberg.... that have taken control of Bitcoin and are working hard to break it. OK.

The entire post sounds like concern trolling, so probably not. But on the off chance you're genuinely trying to learn, I'll bite.


Ready for what? For the whole world to use? Absolutely not. For a whole lotta more people that are using bitcoin today? It most certainly is. Besides, don't mistake the LN protocol/tech vs the UI/UX. Both are WIP, and it depends on you if you want to jump in. Building solid tech takes time, the internet wasn't built in a day. Luckily **we have all the time that we need!!!**
The "sense of urgency" to scale you can hear from bcashers is entirely fake. How many time did you hear two random strangers on the streets bitching about how they couldn't get their coffee because "fees were high"? Exactly zero? I thought so. What about merchants, complaining they couldn't sell because "fees are high"? Neither? Hmmm....
This should be your starting point to rethink about the urgency.


The "other camp" is technically and economically illiterate, but it's difficult to see until you get through the weeds of understanding bitcoin, and it's a pretty huge and complex topic. What the first estimates for LN block requirements miss was all the innovation that would have happened later. In particular I'm referring to channel factories which, together with Schnorr and sig aggregation, allow for a much smaller on-chain foot print.
There's another point which is being "missed" by bcashers. In their mind channels have to be opened and closed all the time, to "cash out". That is completely wrong, because this considers bitcoin as a "payments rail/network" instead of money. In this view it's bitcoin vs VISA/PayPal/Venmo, and not bitcoin vs USD/GBP/EUR/JPY/... Tell me, if you could receive your coins on LN and spend them with any merchant, would you need to close the channels and "cash out"?


Not sure you understand what happened in 2017, but one thing is for sure... as a community, 2017 was a **MASSIVE SUCCESS**. 
* We activated SegWit.
* We rejected a takeover attempt (S2X) led by private interests which did **NOT** have bitcoin as their main interest
* This should have cleared, once and for all, where the power of bitcoin is - with its users
* We successfully defended against a name&amp;ticker appropriation attempt in one of the most vicious attacks on bitcoin ever, the Nov 2017 attempt to drain bitcoin of hash power
* The hostile elements have retreated into their shitcoin(s) and the market has punished them badly
* As a result of all of the above, some of the "masters of the universe" have been beaten into submission (hello Jihan...)
* This forced the various players to get their shit together and start optimizing their usage of block space instead of treating it as a shitter to dump all your UTXO mismanagement problems on
* ...
All these elements combined made the community much stronger and focused on delivering what matters, real scale.


I'm not getting into the technicalities, but even a "small size increase" would have caused a reduction in decentralization, say because OZ bitcoiners would have a very hard time running a full node. What I want to emphasize is that it was never about keeping the community together, it was always about **control**. A BitPay engineer got fired for leaking that S2X was an attempt to wrestle bitcoin out of the hands of "Core". All these battles, that go by various names "scaling debate", "big blocks vs small blocks", "Satoshi's vision", ... , are all about control. Don't be naive to think otherwise.


Yes. A lot more, **A LOT**, can be squeezed out of 1MB blocks. No block size increase until we've exhausted all the other options. And trust me, there's tons coming.


I'm generally not in favour of the decrease, but might end up well supporting it. (Thing is, he's playing a bit of an "oracle" role here, which I reject completely. If he gave more details, I might get behind...) Small blocks keep the chain manageable. Not in terms of storage - Stop listening to shitty stories from bcashers, it's not about storage! - but in terms of initial block download and sync up. And let's not forget network security and miner decentralization, which is what Luke is mainly concerned with.


It works now... in the future it'll only be better. Again, don't listen to bcashers. I've had my LN node up and running for almost a year now, with very few channel closes. The LN is here and it works NOW, everything else is a lie. (UI/UX is also getting better by the day.)


This is another false narrative that bcashers like to push. LN is only ONE of the pieces of the scaling puzzle. Sidechains will be another one. Let's say Blockstream's Liquid, which is aimed at exchanges so traders who arbitrage the price can trade fast and securely without ever touching the chain! But that won't be the only sidechain, others are being built, say Ocean. And I'm sure more will come. Each will be dedicated to a specific goal, which is just what you'd expect in any other market, bespoke solutions for bespoke problems. And of course, let's not ignore on-chain improvements (Schnorr, MAST, sig aggregation, tx compression, ...)
TL;DR There's a lot more we can squeeze out of that 1 "meager" megabyte/block. Nobody will touch the block size until then. And LN will work even with 1MB blocks, especially because it won't be the only solution that helps bitcoin scale.

Lol This is incorrect, or at least we have very strong arguments to believe this to be incorrect. And the main reason is decentralization. To stop a certain transaction **all** governments would need to coordinate a crackdown on a specific transaction. Which will never happen because never in the history of humanity have all the gov agreed on anything. And without an agreement, only a subset of miners can be coerced to block the transaction... but the others will happily process it. And with improvements to the mining protocol, this is going to be increasingly more true.
This is why we claim Bitcoin is censorship resistant - You cannot censor Bitcoin transactions, regardless of how big a player you are.

Alice will not be able to send any payments through Bob UNLESS he funds a channel on his own with someone else. In this case Bob will only be able to receive money from Alice, end of.
But Bob will open channels with others... And the reason for that is that Bob will want to spend his own money for stuff that gets him going. And so he'll become a node in the LN.
But Bob might also want to pocket some of the (tiny) fees, so he may be tempted to open more channels, so he can become an active participant in the routing. Of course, he's hoping to make money off it.

OP is a dumb shit, but you are certainly sending out strange vibes on Twitter. I don't particularly care about BCash, they wanna do their own thing, sure, no worries. It's their constant attacks on the true Bitcoin that I and many others work on addressing on r-btc. 
But when you tweet that BCash is good for payments, given certain compromises, to many it's not clear what that means. Be more explicit about centralization of big blocks.

**This is good.**
Excessive burden on the blockchain raise fees significantly and put pressure to address scaling, talk to ETH devs. Instead, we get a breath of fresh air so the tech can be developed and deployed for the next wave of user rush in, which will be MUCH bigger than the past one.

Or, if nothing else, it's pretty offensive to other populations. Clearly others do not mind "working for peanuts". So yes, compared to other populations, the Brits are lazy. You need to accept it. And the only way to get rid of the other populations is... for Brits to do the ungrateful jobs. Which, of course, you've done for centuries!
It's nothing special in Britain. The same is in the US where "Mexicans" are stealing jobs Americans don't want to do. Yet I've seen a documentary where a black american tried doing a work Mexicans were happy to do (shrimp harvest) and called it "slave labour". Yet with Trump now the Mexicans can't do the job, and American's don't want it. Americans are also lazy.
In general, what you'll find is that **any** developed and rich nation gets "lazy", some jobs are just "beneath" them. It's true all over the world, since the dawn of the ages. That's the ugly truth - Foreigners are not stealing British/American/other-rich-country jobs, they are simply doing the dirty work that **still has to be done** and that Brits/Americans/other-rich-country-citizens don't want to do. But then blame those very foreigners for all the problems.
Opportunist politicians, those that I would call the scum of the political class, exploit this for their personal gain, getting in power.

Not really. It can break the elliptic curve math that underlies it. Not a super expert, so might say something a bit stupid now, but I think it allows you to brute force the discreet logarithm which is at the heart of the security.

I'll give you benefit of the doubt and take you at face value.
You are the perfect example of what Wences Casares means that talking about money to an American is like talking about water to a fish - You grew up with it, it was always there, and barring some minor annoyance here and there, it was always great. You simply **cannot** comprehend what it means to have shit money. You just cannot.
Not everyone is as lucky. 
As with every innovation, the ones embracing it first are the ones who have the least to lose. Many new drugs are tested on dying patients because they know they are dying anyway and a chance, even tiny, to survive is worth it for them. You mention volatility. True, that's a problem. But it's again a problem for **you**, who never experienced hyperinflation. If you had to outrun the store employee who is updating the prices of the goods every few hrs, that volatility would not be as bad. Remember, volatility means down but also UP. And if your expectation is to lose 22% a week with the very real hope that you'll regain it the next, or a 10% loss every week, guaranteed with no possibility to go in the opposite direction, what would YOU choose?
And that's exactly what we are seeing around the world - People who have the least to lose are the ones embracing Bitcoin. Because it's better the EVERY OTHER OPTION 
You say buy gold or USD? They would LOVE TO!!! But they cannot. Because banks consider it too risky to open offices in their country. Banking is a business, and no bank likes geopolitical risk.
Venezuela. Starved of hard currency, and are heavily sanctioned against. You may agree or not, but they are certainly not happy. How could they avoid those sanctions? 
Bitcoin is censorship resistant - no one can censor your txs. It's permissionless - no need to ask for permission. It's trustless - no trusted intermediaries. You ask what problem is Bitcoin solving? Ask Venezuela if these characteristics solve any problems for them. Or for companies who want to trade with Cuba. Or with Russia. Or with any other country on earth, without involving the USD, which is almost impossible. 
Finally, if you don't see that the world is tired of the US, you are blind. That's why China started trading oil for Yuan. Of course, up u til now you could say TINA to the US, and you'd be right. If only there was a global and decentralised currency under no one's control, maybe that could become the world's reserve currency? Would that solve a problem?
Does Bitcoin solve a problem? I don't know, you tell me.

And you obviously don't understand very much about decentralized development, nor about decentralized consensus. It's a tough nut to crack, Bitcoin. Pretty complex, not everyone gets it.


What the fuck does that even mean? The moment you fork away and decide the fate of your new shitcoin unilaterally it doesn't matter at all what happened before. If the Pope went out and started mass shooting, would that absolve him because in the past he's done a lot of good? Get a grip.


Yeah... he also owns equal amounts of BTG, BTCC, BTD, and all the other shitcoin spawn forks of Bitcoin. Yet there's only one Bitcoin.

You can find three groups of people: Small blockers, medium blockers, and big blockers. Big blockers are mainly all snake oil salesmen, you know them. 
"*The Moore law allows us to scale on-chain for ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever ...*"
The small block side you've found out yourself. These are generally people with really strong qualifications in IT. (Qualifications =/= PhD, at least not necessarily. Someone with 20yrs on protocol development is super qualified, even if they only finished high school.) And they basically all tell the same story - Big blocks are no go.
Last group are medium blockers. Their story goes something like: "*OK, we cannot have unlimited block size, because that just doesn't work. But we can also go beyond 1MB we have today. We could probably do 4MB, and then 8MB in a few years. And so on.*" These people understand that huge blocks are suicide, but fail to get the full picture, so try to "compromise". In this group you'll find people with some credibility when it comes to IT in general, though not necessarily in protocol dev. Vitalik, Amaury Sechet, Chris Pacia are a few in this group. The might be a few more, but the point is generally they are not hard core when it comes to protocol development and/or distributed systems design and/or adversarial design.
Draw your own conclusions.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:32:43


Not rude, but firm. It's the only way to address misguided nonsense.
OK, I'll go into a detailed debunk of your claims, that's to help any noobs who might be confused by your marketbabble. Let's start...


There is no such a thing as a "full-paid up contract to buy Bitcoin". At least that's **not** what a futures is. A futures is only an *agreement to buy/sell in the futures, and SETTLE IN THE FUTURE*. You don't settle anything today. A futures is basically a shake of hands that you'll buy/sell in the future. Period. The exchange, on the other hand, requires *some* money down from both so it can settle the contract daily. But that's how the exchange protects *itself*, not you or your counterparty.
Also, a futures is not the same as a Bitcoin because I can close my position at any time, and the futures is no more. Bitcoin, on the other hand, cannot be "created and destroyed" at whim.


Yes and no. But mostly no. Even with physical settlement there is no need to buy the asset! You open a position, market rallies, you close the position and get cash. You've never seen or dremt about actually taking physical deliver of the underlying.


Futures and spot price are **tightly constrained** by NO ARBITRAGE arguments, and that's regardless of physical or cash settlement. If one goes up, the other will follow. And the same is true in reverse.


And yet, there's many more open futures contracts than there are commodities with physical delivery. 
Physical vs cash settlement has got nothing to do with price. Zero. Niet. Nada. Zilch.




You just demonstrated that you have exactly zero real experience in the markets. Or, as Taleb would call it, no "Skin in the Game". Which is why this is all marketbabble.
Do you understand that you need cold hard cash for every position you open? And current margin requirements are ~30%, if not more, on CME and CBOE. That means for every Bitcoin futures, you need to put down 30% of the total contract value! So you can slowly build as much volume as you will, you'll need to put up that cash. 
And "building volume" simply means that you are "selling at the prevailing price". In other words, you've done your trade, and that's it... you're at the mercy of the market. If the market goes against you, which it easily can without you being able to do anything - remember, you've got only so much margin available to open positions - you get to experience what REKT **really** means.
Alternatively, you can short a bit now, market against you, short some more, market against some more, short some more, .... wash rinse and repeat. But that is again limited by the amount of cash you've got available as margin. And even if you have LOADS of money, you are not playing like a whale anymore, dripping a short here and there. Again, at the mercy of the market.
Finally, even if you put up tons of money, the exchange may simply refuse to let you open as many positions as you wish. Exchanges keep an eye on their customers, and if they see you're doing stupid shit, they'll refuse to open you all that many contracts. You cannot just deposit money in a brokerage account and, say, open 1000 contracts on oil. You just cannot. The people who can do that have been around the corner for ages, and are most definitely not wet behind their ears, unlike a noob. Why would the exchange behave like that? Because you could lose your shirt, and then your conspiratorial noob head would convince itself that it was the exchange's fault and you didn't understand all the risks, blah, blah, blah... and sue them. So they prevent it.


Try telling that to a hiring manager on Wall St and see if you get the job. Also demonstrates you don't understand the risks of futures trading... can you see why the exchange will just not let you open all that many positions?


You can sell neither for $7,000 nor for $9,000. Or better, if you attempt to sell at $9,000 you'll get no buyers. At $7,000 people will buy from you as much as they can, and sell their mothers to raise more money to buy from you. Why? Because for every contract you sell at $7,000 they will sell a Bitcoin at $8,000 and get a net, instant and risk-less profit of $1,000. And you'll be on the hook to deliver against your contracts, which will rip your head off. So the exchange won't let you sell any of them.
What I described above is an example of arbitrage trade which constrains the forward and spot price significantly. In the real markets, spot and futures will trade very tightly. Always! And regardless of physical vs cash settlement.
Arbitrageurs keep the spot and the futures price tight.


Huh??? That's exactly why a market exists... some people think there's more to gain by waiting, others think there's more to gain by buying now. It's always been like that, in all the markets, and it again has nothing to do with physical vs cash settlement.
[Here]( I wrote this a while ago to clear some confused minds about spot vs futures price. Read it. And then read it again until it sinks in. You'll learn how simple arbitrage trades work as well.
It's not enough to be intelligent to speak intelligently about a topic. It's clear that you have no skin in the game. Take the time to educate yourself, by talking to people who have. And perhaps start playing in the markets, no better education than real life education.

You seem confused. Let's say the US bans bitcoin. Now what? Is the US gonna stop me from downloading a wallet? There's VPN available for everyone, so I'll always get a wallet. Once I have a wallet, they can't stop my transactions. I explained above why - They cannot coerce miners in other countries to not process the transaction. So it'll get confirmed. Bottom line, I'm using bitcoin in the US. And the same logic applies for every other country. Say China, where bitcoin has been clamped down already but people are using it anyway.

Jihan Wu is CEO of Bitmain, which became the biggest (by FAR!) mining company in Bitcoin. At some point their stock was ~80% of all bitcoin miners.
Last year Jihan made a lot of stupid decisions, including attacking bitcoin. This explains the hatred for Bitmain and Jihan. Perhaps the most stupid mistake though was to double down at every opportunity he had, throwing good money (BTC) after bad (bcash). Bitmain basically has no bitcoin left and the heaviest bag of bcash, estimated at ~800k BCH. 
But the satisfaction you can see is because Jihan was one of the most hostile players in bitcoin, and seeing him go down is a great thing for bitcoin.

No it cannot. If the Chinese miners won't mine the txs, another miner will. Pay a high enough fee, and if the Chinese miners refused it, sure as fuck it will be picked up in the first non-Chinese mined block.
And they can't even freeze the system... The miners are actually pools of miners. If pool operators were to launch a 51% attack, individual miners who don't want to participate would leave the pool immediately.,. And join the other pools.
So yeah, you need to get a better understanding of how it all works.

TL;DR No, Bitcoin will not replace banks.
The OP statement comes from a very vague understanding of banks - What they are, what they do and how they operate. Banks will, in fact, happily embrace Bitcoin and do business as usual. But banks will also change, and Bitcoin+L2 solutions will take a big bite at their lunch, the "fees for moving money" dish.
Banks make money in various ways, and most of that will be unaffected. Examples:
* Custody - Banks started out as places people would put their gold to be safe, and pay banks a custodial fee. This is still the case, you just don't see it because the interest they offer for your money already includes the cost of storage. But the demand to store wealth will always be there - No, my grandmom will not buy a Trezor - and so banks will adapt. How? The simplest thing to do will be to buy out smaller firms, like CasaHODL. They are a custodial business and charge a fee, just like banks with gold in the past. Only they call themselves a "family office" because to call yourself a bank is terribly expensive and legally dangerous... 
* Moving wealth - That will get disrupted. But even this will likely find it's way back... Keep money with a bank and wanna move it? OK, they'll do it and charge you a small fee on top of the network fee.
* Lending - Yeah, Bitcoin won't change a thing about lending. Or maybe it will indirectly, by forcing banks to lower their fractional reserve ratios. A system of competing banks with different reserve ratios will emerge, with some banks being full reserve and others being more aggressive. But the point is that you'll always need a bank for that mortgage, or to buy new machinery for your business, or to get a bigger wedding than you really need...
There's more, especially if you start looking at Wall St and structured finance, or derivatives, but none of that will go away. Your retail bank is lending Bitcoin? Wall St will respond with Bitcoin-based derivatives. For them there's nothing different, they have derivatives in many currencies as is!
So why do we bother with Bitcoin?? Hello FED/ECB/BoE/BoJ and all the other central banks in the world... Warm advice, start looking for a new job.

Try to be more subtle in your thinking. It's not a failure of PoW if, for example, we as a community split up badly and cause confusion. It's not a failure of PoW if a state level actor amasses enough hashpower to cripple bitcoin. It's not a failure of PoW if a bug not related to PoW cripples the network. And so on.
Besides, simply talking of "PoW failure" shows you are not too comfortable with the concept. PoW is a mechanism to achieve distributed consensus. It cannot "fail". And we understand the limits and strengths of PoW very well. But a decentralized system based on PoW can be attacked in various ways, some of which have got nothing to do with PoW.

Unpopular opinion, this is pointless.
Central banks are known as "lenders of last resort", and they are ready with vast resources to support any bank in trouble. That's perhaps the primary reason why they were established to begin with.
If the ECB + French central bank for some reason are not enough to placate this, the French government will step in with a bail out.You hate bailouts? That's the perfect way to get one.
And if all of the above doesn't work, what do you think will happen? Bank goes down and life carries on as normal? Nope. Many people will be affected, the very people who brought the bank down in the first place! Because maybe their company will be affected and they will be laid off. Or their savings will be decimated. Or their pension, or...

The reason for that is simple. In summer 2017 a several year long debate on how to scale bitcoin came to an end, with a small part of the community forking themselves off into a new coin, Bitcoin Cash, or more simply bcash. What was the plan of the fork? Well, the plan was to attack bitcoin in all possible ways with the goal of taking over it. Cripple bitcoin and take its spot with a fork, bcash. This is why for the longest time the bcash community has been shouting to anyone willing to listen that "*Bitcoin Cash is the reeeeel Bitcoin because cash/Satoshi/peer-to-peer/miner-powa/....*", all in an attempt to kill the real bitcoin. It just so happens that the owner of bitcon.com is a leading figure of that small community, and the complete rebranding of the website is part of this still ongoing attack. (Though it's ongoing, it has significantly decayed in relevance to the point that no one is dedicating much attention to them anymore.) The goal? Confuse noobs and sell them bcash for bitcoin.

And even those who actually want the Bitcoin, they will just get one of the existing ones, not a new one. Nothing is brought into existence.

Make no mistake, and don't listen to conspiracy idiots, the block size will be increased, once it's viable to do. Currently it's not. Sounds crazy how we stream 4K, huge disks are cheap as chips, and yet a block size larger than 1MB is not sustainable, but it's true.
Don't want to write poems, so very shortly, with a block size of 2MB the chain would grow faster than tech improves. (Current chain is ~220GB, 1yr of 2MB blocks is ~100GB, that's a ~45% increase. Historically tech has progressed at ~&lt;20%/yr.) This makes the burden of running a node ever bigger, which means people just won't do it. Fewer nodes, more centralization, etc...

Not sure I saw a sensible answer so far, so here goes.
It's possible to generate your private keys from one initial random number. (Actually, you can generate many private keys starting from the seller initial random number.) This random number is encoded with words rather than numbers so it's easier to store and save. And the relationship between this initial seed and your private keys is **deterministic**, based on math. So you are only trusting that your hardware wallet implements this deterministic derivation correctly. Luckily Trezor is open source, so people have reviewed the code and no one has found any problems. Point being, **ANY** wallet that implements that mathematical derivation correctly will recover the same private keys, you are not limited to Trezor. Which is why you can recover your coins even if you lose your Trezor, but still have the keys.

My friends are wondering how can I keep yelling ***BLOODBATH!!!*** and being completely emotionally unattached.
The truth is this period of calm is extremely good for Bitcoin. EXTREMELY. And that's because Bitcoin is not yet ready for prime time. No matter how much you cry "CRYPTO, BABY!!!", none of the cryptos is ready for prime time. So these months of calm allow
* Businesses to consolidate their UTXOs for cheap
* People experimenting with Bitcoin for cheap
* Devs working AND having a life
* More devs implementing the available solutions
* Core devs focusing on fundamental research to relieve the network even more
* ...

Wanna do the maths again? 
With BTC @ $1m, 1sat = $0.01 = $1c.
Regardless, this has got nothing to do with deflation. And you miss the point - There are no BTC at the protocol level, only Satoshis. If necessary, a hard fork could simply redefine the smallest unit like so, for example, 1000new-sat = 1sat. And all the holdings would now be expressed with the understanding that 100bn new-Satoshi = 1 BTC. No decimals to be seen anywhere, only integer operations, as I explained above. This gives plenty of small units to play with and pay everything down to the cent and less.

I think you are looking this differently than what I intended...




Alice and Bob are not connected to anyone else in my example, and I'm the *only* relaying node. In other words, Alice and Bob can only communicate through me, and I have no interest in sending them money other than sitting between them to relay the payments. This is basically a schematic representation of what many LN nodes will do.
So I am stuck in the sense that Alice cannot send any more funds to Bob - Remember they are only connected to each other through me.


Frictionless channel rebalancing allows me to have balances exactly where I need them, since I can move the funds from one end to the other as I need it. This would allow me to rebalance the channels so Alice could send Bob more BTC.

It does add up... I'm not trading alts to make more fiat, but to get more BTC. I know that's not a 10% gain in fiat, but in BTC terms. Say as follows:
1 BTC &gt; 10 ALT, BTC @ $6k
10 ALT &gt; 1.1 BTC, BTC @ $15k
That will trigger a much larger tax than the 0.1 BTC, so your profitable BTC trade is a loser in fiat, because of taxes. Stated otherwise, you make 10% in BTC, but the tax bill will take that 10%, and more, away. So you would have been better not trading at all. If you now do the BTC &gt; ALT &gt; BTC trade, you give back those "gains", and keep your increased BTC stash.

The capital requirements are then expressed as Tier 1, 2 etc, and the requirement is that Tier 1 capital must be at least 11% of RWAs. 
Let's say you your RWAs are $1bn, you must hold at least $110m in Tier 1 capital, which is basically cash. So flip this upside down, if you have $110m in cash, you can buy risky assets up to $1bn RWA. The riskier the asset, the least you'll be able to buy. Top risk is 1,250% risk weight so cryptos are pretty penalized.
Let's say the bank wants to hold only cryptos, ~$100m of cryptos would give you pretty much ~$1bn of RWA (there's another piece to calculate the RWA, I'm assuming it makes up the remaining ~$200m, which is not a crazy assumption.) So more or less you'd be holding 1-for-1 in capital.

You are talking confidently, as someone who understood what they were talking about would. But you don't. Really, you don't.
First, not very many claim that the only value of the blockchain technology is Bitcoin. The blockchain can be used for many applications, and it will be, but most of the application hype you are seeing today will die down. And that is simply because people don't understand the blockchain, and the subtle incentives built in that make the whole thing function.
And once you understand the balances in play, it is natural to ask yourself what is the 'killer app' of such technology. And the answer is very simple - Transfer of 'value', decentralised, permissionless and censorship resistant. Which is exactly what Bitcoin is.
So yes, the killer app for blockchain is Bitcoin. It won't be the only application, but it certainly will be one. And if you want to play the MySpace/Altavista/AOL game, OK, maybe transfer of value won't be realised through Bitcoin but some other crypto. But a crypto it will be. That's something people are starting to realise, as that S Korean politician demonstrated in his very recent speech. Why? Because of those delicate incentives I mentioned.

Some of what you say is true, other is misguided. You understand things better if you frame bitcoin as money... This means SoV, MoE AND UoA. At that point, you don't look to close channels because you don't need to "cash out". You never close your Venmo account because you need to "cash out", do you? Closing channels then becomes pretty pointless and actually something you want to avoid, because it costs you fees. As an example, I've had my  LN node up and running for the past ~6mos. After the channels were opened, I never closed them again. Some were closed by the other guy, some unexpectedly, but never by me intentionally. More and more people will start to think like that, so you'll never close your channels.
It will take some time to get everyone on board, like everything else. New tech never happens overnight. And, key point, people are not ready mentally to embrace a stateless money. It's a difficult concept, not knowing who is responsible for your money.

One, I don't think it's correct... Not for Bitcoin anyway.
But it's possible because of slippage. If you place an order for, say, $10k, for a shitcoin, the first part of the order will execute at a different (lower) price than he last part of the order. Basically because there's not enough liquidity, not many people are willing to sell at that first (low) price. And since the market cap is just price*supply, when you buy at the last price you've basically pushed the market cap up.

At it's most fundamental level it's because fiat transaction fees between banks.
If moving money across the globe, from one exchange to another, was frictionless, aka no fees, all the price discrepancies would disappear over night. Arbitrageurs would buy the lows and sell the highs, making a profit. But this cannot happen because moving fiat from one exchange to another costs more money than you'd make by trying to arbitrage the prices away.
Basically these price differences are a result of the disfunctional state of affairs with moving money around the globe.

Until you realize Bcash is only more profitable when EDA drops the difficulty enough that mining it will give you 100 blocks per hour, or something. As soon as the diff climbs back up enough, so in 1 or 2 days, it's no longer profitable. 
It costs ~1000USD to mint a bitcoin. That's electricity cost, mainly. If the hash power is directed to Bcash, then they are losing ~600USD for every Bcash minted.

Wrong. POW might be the total amount of Jules spent mining, but it's measured by the number of blocks. 
A thought experiment may help you convince yourself of this. If 80% of BTC hash power were to migrate to BCash, after the difficulty adjustment, block mining would continue normally. Now imagine this situation goes on for 1yr. With the current hash power, this would put more Jules into Bcash than BTC in total since they share most of the history. Would that make Bcash de facto bitcoin?
Another way to look at it... if someone was to gain MASSIVE advantage in mining because they found a super optimized way to mine, say spending 70% of the energy to gain 2x the mining power **simply as a result of an optimized mining algorithm**, and they and they started mining in private with malicious intent. After 1 week, the energy expenditure is ~70% of the original chain, and 2x the number blocks. If these blocks are released to the network, there will be a chain reorg, and the malicious blocks will be accepted as longest PoW.

Don't get too excited, you are just one of the Villains. And arguably not the biggest one.
But rationalize this as you might, you are controlled by corporate interests. Your board owns your ass, just like any board owns the businesses ass. And boards are rarely made of youngsters, for better or worse. And these "savvy captains of the industry" don't share the view, nor the desire, of the younger generation. Your board is made up of people who have done very well for themselves, so they have very little incentive to "change the system". Yet this is what bitcoin is, a massive disruption to the status quo.
Lastly, your boards has a fiduciary duty to the shareholders. This means your will do whatever makes shareholders more money, not whatever is best for bitcoin. Let's put it differently. If, as a result of poor design choices today bitcoin was to fail in 10yrs, and you sold ShapeShift for good money in 5yrs, your board would have achieved it's main goal, maximising shareholder profit.
So please stop pretending that you "just disagree". In this sense I actually give more credit to the big blocker crowd, at least they are genuine. Your words? I cannot tell where is the fine line between pre-ShapeShift personal opinion and ShapeShift corporate dictum.
You are not acting in the users best interest, you are acting in your shareholders best interest. You cannot rationalize the conflict away.

OK, let me give this a go. You can think of it as the union of a Merkle tree and "smart contracts". Specifically, from a Merkle tree you can calculate the root. The beauty of it is that you can very quickly check if a specific hash is in the tree just by having the root. Now if you have smart contracts make up the tree, you could check if a specific smart contract is included or not, just from the root.
This is useful because it allows more complex scripting to be introduced, like "These funds can only be spent by 4 out of 7 people AND the CEO must be one of them", whilst reducing the size of the script significantly, as well as making all these complex scripts look identical to chain analysis companies.

The truth is... there's a lot of ground to be gained, everywhere.
Up until 2017 Bitcoin was just not known. A few journos, Jamie Dimon and r-bitcoin does not make it known. You would have asked people about Bitcoin in 2016, and everybody would stare at you like you're from Mars. It was no different in impoverished countries.
After 2017, it is now pretty much within everyone's awareness. And people are doing whatever they can to get their hand on it in the worse off places. News like Venezuela's wealthy trying to get Bitcoin to preserve their wealth, because they can't get anything else... gold or the USD. And the poor are clandestine mining, to get some coins. Does it help? Yes. Does it help a lot? No. But it's a start. 
People can work for Bitcoin - Say doing translations online, or teaching maths, or coding. I have personally engaged a dev to write some code for me, and paid in BTC. Granted, it was a US dev, but it could have easily been from anywhere else. We've split the work in milestones, and after every milestone I'd send BTC to him. Could have been in Venezuela, for all I care.
At the end of the day, one of the key things about Bitcoin is that it removes friction in the banking world. You can move value across borders without anyone being able to do anything about it. This of itself has a lot of value in a global economy. The rest will come over time. Slowly but surely local economies will start to improve, where they are now stuck because they cannot access the traditional banking system.

Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, so it cannot have a social media account. BUT... people did appropriate themselves of related social media accounts, and  is spreading all sorts of lies about bitcoin. The reason? Some people would like to coerce the name because it's a powerful name.
bitcoin,com is run by Roger Ver, a "persona non grata" around here as he's one of main architects behind the false propaganda that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. (It's not... like, it's obvious by the name... Bitcoin is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash.) 
bitcoin.org, on the other hand, is the official website for bitcoin. You should have a look around, it extremely informative.

Two comments. One, most of the "skeptical" posts that I have seen are just cheap, low level effort FUD attempts. If you're a newbie, I can see how most of Bitcoin is obscure to you, but that doesn't mean this community needs to explain and go over the basics all the time. The effort is on you to understand things, and if you are a beginner, a better place is perhaps r/BitcoinBeginners. There are also the daily threads, where you can ask various questions, including voice your skepticism. But if all you do is come here and say "Bitcoin is doomed because is not backed by anything!!!!", or some shit like that, then suffer the consequences.
Second comment, this sub is dedicated to discussing Bitcoin, not any other "competing idea", aka altcoin. So posts that say "Shitcoin XYZ is better the BTC because reasons" get removed, and rightly so.
What is left if people's enthusiasm, which tends to favour bullish posts. Or "funny" memes. And I would actually agree to being stricter with the price threads... having said that, the past month was full of posts of people telling us how Bitcoin is now dead, again, this time for real. So now the community is just cheering and celebrating yet another rise from the dead.

OK... But this is a completely different story. It's likely correct. As for most shitcoins today, at the very early stages of Bitcoin you'd put a $1,000 order and you'd lift the market cap a ton.

I know your own incompetence bores you... but 


You just displayed a total ignorance about markets. I did not say market **cap**, but ***depth***. See, there's a difference. Market depth, very simply, means that you can trade even large quantities without moving the price much. This is key for any hope of price stability. You dump $1m in BTC, the price won't change at all. You dump $1m in either DGB or XMR, and watch that price (and market cap) skyrocket. You should think about it.
(Also, it's already been explained to you that the market cap is a useless metric, and you quoting this is just further proof that you don't really understand what you're talking about.) 


100% correct. If a merchant is to start accepting cryptos, they will accept BTC. Once they are comfortable with that, they might try something else. But you specifically mentioned XMR and DGB... and I asked you for ONE example of a merchant accepting DGB. You did not provide.


Depth of thinking = very shallow. People who bought BTC are only a **small minority** of the entire population. If you ask a random middle aged person on the street if they heard about Monero, they will look at you like you're crazy. But if you ask them about Bitcoin, chances are they did hear about it. So BTC has the highest mainstream awareness of them all. By FAR. (Also, how many coins have futures trading against them? yeah, mainstream awareness.)
Bottom line, you still didn't provide any examples of a coin that is as advanced as Bitcoin when you consider the whole package. Good luck finding one...

That argument is poor. If Bitcoin fails, its is extremely difficult anything will succeed. The reason is simple, despite all the FUD and BS on bitcoin, people are learning and understand the system today MUCH more than even 3yrs ago. Including adversaries. 
So let's say bitcoin fails and we are all giddy and wanna go on to set up bitcoin 2.0. But that would upset a lot of incumbent interests, right? Right. So what do they do to kill bitcoin 2.0? Buy a ton of hash power and kill it from the start.
Bitcoin enjoyed a long honeymoon where (almost) any effort went into propping it up, not attacking it. Certainly not attacking with hash power where the only clear attack came from bcash last year. No new coin will enjoy that honeymoon against a well funded adversary.

1. It is all about control. If some people want to fork, they can do it at any time, no need for agreements and what have you. And now we're not seeing a simple fork, Bcash was a fork. S2X is a hostile attempt at takeover **because of the lack of replay protection**. That is intentional, to trick SPV wallets into believing the new S2X chain is the bitcoin chain. It's not.
2. I don't know what is being discussed, but would not be surprised to find they are discussing political issues. I agree with your sentiment that coders should code, but there's no one defending the Core position, so they have to do it themselves. Politics is **invevitable** when human interactions are present.
3. The same way as the IETF managed to build this great thing called the Internet. You propose, you discuss, you address concerns. If serious concerns are raised, it's a no-go. If it's a "it'd be great", then it can be ignored. Google about the IETF's way of proceeding.
4. I disagree on this one, but to each their own. The tech is important, no doubts about it, but the possibility of having sound, decentralized money under no-one's control is much more important. In the early days of the Internet private Cos were trying to do the same, build private internets. To the benefit of all, they failed. Hopefully something similar will happen with bitcoin.

Misunderstanding. Nobody here considers **all** miners to be malicious actors. Miners are a fundamental part of the ecosystem, and everybody is fully aware of that. But there are malicious actors, and the vitriol in this sub is directed towards them, not all miners. And since there are non-malicious miners, the malicious ones can fork off. The consequence will be a temporary backlog of transactions, until the next diff adjustment.
And if **ALL** miners leave? I'm willing to bet many a coin the core devs have software ready to deploy that bricks their hardware (change of PoW), reset the difficulty, AND a new algo fit for GPU mining. I'm most certainly gonna fire that old rig up back again. Network secure, miners with millions-worth of paper weights, small miners happy. I'm sure you can see who's the loser here.

False. UASF forced SegWit through. Miners and everyone else realised that come Aug 1st, there was a very large number of people/nodes who would start rejecting non-SegWit blocks, simply because that's what users wanted and they didn't need the miners' "permission" to do so. Miners were, for years, blocking SW. And they would continue to do it if they could, since that's lowering their fees, and disabling ASICboost.
As for the rest of your reply, it's just an empty reply. Because you cannot point to those 10 businesses. BitPay, on the other hand, directed their users to the btc1 software github repo saying it was necessary for SW. It's not. This was considered a malicious attack on the network, and that's what got them yanked from bitcoin.org - Go have a look if you can find them in the list of businesses. I can assure you they were there a month ago. So they did take bold action, and now they are suffering the consequences. (Admittedly small for now.)

BitPay were acting very questionably in Bitcoin. For instance, last year when S2X was being opposed by the community, and AFTER SegWit was already activated, they were recommending their users to upgrade to the S2X software to, allegedly, "get the benefits of SegWit". This was blatantly false - You don't need the S2X software to use SegWit. 
More recently, they started pushing BCH over Bitcoin. Say both options are given to users, BCH comes with zero "network fee" but Bitcoin can have a non-negligible "network fee". Nobody really knows what these "network fees" are since they confirmed they're not miner fees, which are also as low as it gets today.
I'm sure there's more... But these are just two very obvious examples. So guess what? We advise EVERYONE that cares about Bitcoin to go elsewhere. You punish them by not giving them your business. Simple.

This is such a simplistic analysis which demonstrates, to anyone with some real understanding of the markets, that you don't know what you're talking about.


You are assuming the market can absorb $10m at $12k... it can't, there's slippage all over the place. Start selling @ $12k, end selling at $10k is MUCH more likely. 
Hint: Check any real life orderbook. I looked at Bitstamp right now, you wanna get $10m, you'll need to sell ~1,000BTC. Price ~$9,700... to get to 1,000 BTC you need to get to a price of ~$9,100/ And that assumes *the order book doesn't change during your dump*. It will, bots will pile in on the trade to push down with, stop losses will get triggered and then some. If you end the trade, i.e. last BTC sold @ ~8,500 you're lucky. So you won't get $10m.


You cannot. CME margin requirements are pretty brutal, see [here]( Basically you'll initiate a short of another ~800 BTC, as the initial margin for a speculator, which is what you are, is 110% and you DON'T have $10m, as noted above. And again you'll incur in dramatic slippage, on the futures this time, your average sell price will likely be ~$7,500 or so.
At this point the price will be, say, $7,000. But you don't have any extra money in your account! Settlement is daily, so you still only have the proceeds from the previous sale. And now you need to unwind your short futures position. Means you need to start BUYING to be **flat** on the futures. Will the market keep crashing? That's anybody's guess. It might. Or it might not. Remember November, when Novogratz came in and bought $20m @ ~$5,500? Roger and the rest of the BCash gang didn't plan for another whale playing... and neither are you. What is sure is that *you will incur additional slippage on your buy back*! And once you're done buying the futures back, that's when you have to start buying the BTC back. Slippage anyone?
Bottom line... it doesn't work. Slippage will eat you alive, which you'll incur 4 times (!!!), and trade fees will help with that. So yeah, not gonna work. Certainly not without taking a significant amount of risk. Which means... it's a gamble. Be my guest. 
you're right... if it was so easy, it'd be happening all the time. It's not.

And what makes you think Bitcoin's offshoots are decentralized, pray tell? Just looking at bcash you can gather pretty fast that it's a centralized shitcoin.

It's on the front page now... you are not searching well.


That's a liberal/personal interpretation of "the philosophy of bitcoin", which is much more like "your money, your power, your responsibility". Keeping your money secure has always been the responsibility of the individual. In the past, you would actually pay banks to keep your money safe. Getting paid to put money in a bank is a very modern distortion - Banks provide security AND you are being paid for it. 
With bitcoin, you are taking away the power of the central banks, but it comes at a price - The responsibility to secure it is on you, and you only. Wanna cheap out? So be it. Wanna go security nuts? You can. Point is, the choice is yours, and you can do whatever you want once you understand the risks.
This idea that everything should be free/super cheap, and/or that we'll all get rich because of bitcoin has got nothing to do with what bitcoin is all about.

You are making a mistake: Once honest, always honest.
Erik and many others did a lot of good to bitcoin, and that includes Roger Ver, to be clear. But that does not mean they get a Get-Out-Of-Jail free card for ever. The opposite is true: You need to keep earning that respect, and continually prove your honesty to enjoy a high standing. And this community is doing a pretty good job at this, calling out all the malicious actors as they emerge.
As long as people try to corporatize bitcoin, it doesn't matter how much good they've done in the past, they should be considered malicious actors now. Also doesn't mean they will forever be shunned... so long as they manage to start acting in the community's best interest, they will be most welcome.

This is a rhetorical question, at best. FUD at worst.
The key point is decentralization. If you want to call a trustless and decentrlized currency *fiat* because it meets some vague definition of *fiat*, sure... then it's fiat. Who cares.
It's decentralized, you cannot change it without **extremely broad** consensus, and no government can shut it down. If you find another **single** example of a currency with this properties, then you can claim *"Bitcoin is no different than any other fiat."* 
Don't think you'll find it.

This is not accurate, the Twitter OP has no idea oh how banks work.
When you deposit money in a bank you have a legal claim on their assets. Some of these assets are actually **over collateralised**. Think about a mortgage: You put down 20% or more, and the bank has the right to your property for full repayment. So the 80% they lend you are secured by 100% of the property value. 
Moreover, in case of bankruptcy, your claim to their assets is still valid! This means all the assets get liquidated, and you get (part of) your money back. 
So to really lose all of your money, two things have to happen:
1) The bank goes belly up
2) The entire market+ economy goes to the gutter
Possible? Absolutely. Likely? Not really.
And finally... There's also generally a Govt guarantee on all your money up to a certain amount. So even if the above happens, the Govt will step in and guarantee your money.

This is something so many miss about bitcoin. They talk about a bubble, and completely miss that the bubble corrected severely many times. Earlier this year it was ~3000 to ~1800, a pretty hefty ~40% correction.
If the stock market was to correct, say, 30% you'd have journalists happily talk about the obvious bubble and how it had to correct and more. Also possibly the next recession. And the market would not recover for years.
Bitcoin? Shrugs these corrections off, and on it goes to reach an EHATH - Even Higher ATH!

Can we stop referring to the whitepaper as if it is some sort of holy scripture, please.
The system has evolved and changed. Today miners are only a small part of the consensus generating players. Full nodes validate blocks, miners simply "assemble" them. Miners don't need S2X, BCash, BTU, BTABC, ... to start mining different consensus rules. They could do so now, according to their own desires and views. That they don't tells you something about the true voting power/consensus establishing in the bitcoin economy. And it is precisely those full nodes you are dismissing that validate blocks, rejecting them if they are not valid. That's the real reason why miners don't mine some bitcoin clone/altcoin/shitcoin.
As for consensus on S2X, there clearly is no consensus. The community is split --&gt; No consensus by definition.

Not if you don't sell, you can delay that tax. But if you realised profits in ALT trading bacause of the parabolic rise, the "gains" have been realised, so you are on the hook. My suggestion effectively delays taxes on those "gains".


This is true... I looked at it as a tentative ALT trader. And that's because ALT traders have likely realised giant gains because of BTC's huge gains.
Say you do BTC &gt; ALT, BTC @ $6k. Then you have to wait several months to make a 10% profit in BTC terms, but now BTC is $15k. You just realised a giant gain, for only 10% BTC gain. The tax bill will be higher than your BTC gain. If you now do the trade I suggested today, you will give those gains away, and end up with a BTC gain. The tax will be delayed.


Think my example above shows that you do save money... for little work.

This is exactly how the market works. Many people will eventually sell their coins, for various reasons. When people think they have a good profit pocketed, they cash out at least part of it. If you have 1 BTC, and you want to buy a house, you'll wait until it hits something like $50k so you can put the 20% down. If you have 10BTC, and the same goal, you could sell now. And someone else has other ambitions, and will sell when it suits them.
As for the price going up, that's fundamental increase in demand, and a limited supply.

I think POS is flawed at its core. Basic reason, it encourages coin hoarding, well beyond hodling. 
Imagine a starting point where the coins are uniformly distributed. Over time, selected individuals/groups will accumulate more and more coins simply because they spend less coins than others at the beginning. And the more coins they have, the more coins they end up having.
POS is, at its core, receiving interests on money you already have. Strongly favours the people with large amounts of money.  This problem exists with all currencies, but you really don't need to "print" new money and give it to the richest bunch just because they are rich.

It's true an attack would be painful, but I have this feeling it would not be nowhere near as painful as many are assuming.
Mining has a real cost, think it's currently approx $1000 per bitcoin. When you have to pay that money out every month, you better make sure you have enough income to pay that. Switching to the new chain may not  provide that income, much like Bcash does not. That's the real reason why people don't mine Bcash, and if S2X fails to gain massive traction very rapidly, why people won't mine it.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:18:27
Hard forks should be avoided to the highest extent possible for various reasons, but keeping the "fundamental laws of the universe in place" is not one of them. People could rely on Bitcoin even if a hard fork was to happen, mostly in terms of it still being sound money.

Well... I think Bitcoin would remain the most secure chain. With the caveat that that would still be the **legacy chain**. So the PoW-changed chain would not be Bitcoin anymore, but an altcoin. Why? Because with the exception of a few, no business would say "Sure, let me do all this dev work to support a new coin and rename it BTC." Instead, you do nothing and continue to call the legacy chain BTC!
Isn't that a likely outcome for ShapeShift? As a businessman, your thoughts?

Please, let them go! By all means, everyone would be happy!!
But you cannot call yourself bitcoin. And if you don't make the fork smooth, and *I lose my coins* because your shitty fork does not include basic features to ensure a smooth transaction, I will sue your exchange/wallet/business ass. Trust me, the businesses know this well.
As for bitcoin's "resistance to change", that's a feature and not a bug. It's GOOD that bitcoin is difficult to change, you have plenty of examples of currencies out there that can change at the whim of few people. It's also why people's trust in them is decreasing. Gold would not have been the ultimate store of value throughout history if it were to change from one day to the next. Instead, you know that 1oz of gold will be 1oz of gold for eternity.
Last, 


If that's what you want, stick with fiat. By definition, plenty of "central bank policy like decisions" are being made with fiat all over the place. That's centralization, the OPPOSITE of what bitcoin is. And that's why it should be fought back with max possible force. This is also tightly linked to the comment on resistance to change I made above.

Well said... think so few actually understand that.
It would not only be open attacks as a fake chain, it would become an altcoin! In the sense that BTC would be the ticker of the legacy chain. If you think about all the stakeholders - Businesses, Miners, Exchanges, Web wallets and users - only users might switch to the new coin. But everyone else, with the exception of a few, would stick with the legacy chain... simply because there's less to do. Which is... Nothing! Nobody has to do anything, and Bitcoin continues to live. That's your BTC. The fork becomes an altcoin... and also the dev work would be "wasted" as it becomes pretty easy to copy the features you want to the legacy chain.

They are not the same. Txs on that new coin won't be accepted on the Bitcoin blockchain. Further, the new network won't be nowhere near as secure as the BTC network. In fact, it'll be a lot less secure because any bozo with two miners could 51% attack it and kill it.
So no, they are not the same. And this still doesn't mean other cryptos won't survive. But other cryptos are not the same.

I'm a bit perplexed, not sure I get what your take away from that article is. I am taking away something pretty different:




I've put a highlight on the key point - high-end user. What about the average Joe?








I've again highlighted relevant stuff myself.
Finally, my personal experience. Live in a highly and densely populated US city. Had 50 Mbps connection 4 years ago, have 50 Mbps connection now. Price difference? Minimal. $65 today, maybe $10 cheaper today... but not sure, quite possibly the same! Could I get 300Mbps? Yes. How much will it cost me? Over $100. Not to mention 500 Mbps. I'm not gonna spend all that much money to run a full node, and right now I'm running my might RasPi3 24/7, no interruptions.
Edit: Another gem from the article:




That's EXACTLY the philosophy behind BTC's approach - Ensure the average Joe can run a node, not a $20k machine.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:16:28


Reduces the size of inputs, actually. So allows for more txs per block.


True. Everything works just as well on any other coin AFTER it has been developed. Not sure you're aware of it, but Schnorr doesn't work "out of the box", it requires pushing crypto&amp;IT boundaries. A few papers have been/will be published and THEN it will be available. Of course, first on BTC and then on any other coin that will want to copy it. But no Core devs/researchers, no Schnorr. Don't think BCash has any of that.

This sub is simply showing you the reaction to a hostile attempt at changing the existing rules. Nothing new under the sun.
I don't care how much you want to rationalize it, but the fact of the matter is that there is no consensus on S2X. That several businesses get together and decide to change the rules as they please against the will of the users is precisely what is happening in the fiat economy, and people are getting increasingly more pissed off because of it. You are seeing the same reaction here.
As for consensus, there is no community consensus for S2X, regardless of how much you want to convince yourself otherwise. Yes, businesses have signed up to NYA, but that **never** had support from the devs. The devs even said that should S2X go ahead, they would just drop bitcoin and go do something else. Next, look at this sub's community. So many people already deployed 0.15. That is what users want. That is a clear vote about what users want, and you are ignoring it. 
Make no mistake, you are currently considered a malicious actor in this community. You are a threat to the bitcoin community, and the community is reacting.
WTF happened to this sub? Exactly the same thing that happens when governments ignore the will of the people --- The people get angry. If you are surprised by that, I'm afraid you don't really understand how the real world works.

And my node will soon join the v0.15 crowd. And there are several other businesses, most of which are very quiet about S2X. So not at all clear they are in favour, or against for that matter.

You are making a lot of empty claims, not going to counter them. But it does show you don't have a very clear picture. Only one I will respond to. It's one thing to do "sensible planning", prepare your code to switch to the hard fork, and wait. It is an entirely different story when you tell your users they need to update to btc1 for SegWit. That is not true, and it is the reason they got yanked from bitcoin.org, whether you agree with it or not. 
And conspiracy theories have got nothing to do here. ViaBTC has openly stated they wanted to "fire core", and BitPay took sides - The same side as ViaBTC is on. If you don't think that's not a malicious attack on the core developers, well, you may wanna leave the land of fairy tales and come back to the real world.

In the long run, Bitcoin will need a healthy fee market, and a non-marginal txs backlog. This is to sustain the network once the block reward diminishes significantly. In short, *on-chain* fees must be high for the network to be healthy in the long term. It's difficult to swallow, but it's a fact. And one reason why we, small block proponents, insist on small blocks + L2 solutions for scaling.
(If you want more details on the block reward, Google 'On the instability of Bitcoin in the absence of block reward' and read the paper.)
If on-chain fees are low, it becomes very easy to hijack the network simply because there's not enough incentive. This is what the big block crowd doesn't want to accept. Thing is, it won't be visible today or tomorrow... It will take some time to play out. And some time I mean possibly 10+ yrs. That's why it's easy to miss. Buy the problem exists today, even if you can't see it.
BCash could solve the problem by merge mining - Basically BTC miners mining both chains at the same time. Do work once, valid on both chains. But that would be very hard to swallow for them... Basically an admission they can't go on their own...

There's excessive focus on miners, but there shouldn't. Miners don't have the power to do much. The decentralisation is about **decentralisation of full nodes**.
If blocks are so large only corp level investment can sustain the cost, only corps will run full nodes. Then, if a govt wanted to shut bitcoin down, it'd be fairly easy, just impose sanctions on businesses. And a big economic player like the US could force it's trade partners to do it too. End of bitcoin.
It's about keeping the full nodes as decentralised as possible, which makes it impossible to kill the network.

This is a distorted view, prob driven by an agenda. It also shows you don't fully appreciate Bitcoin's true strength... which is exactly what Jihan is painting as "bad". And that is Bitcoin's immutability. If Bitcoin remained as is right now, it'd be perfectly fine. Why? Because people need to **trust** their money, and you just cannot trust a blockchain that needs a hard fork every year to recover funds after a cluster fuck. 
Every blockchain coin has the same problems as Bitcoin, but you can't see them because nobody uses the shitcoins. The difference? Bitcoin is working on addressing these problems.

That website gives you a snapshot of the un-confirmed transactions and the fees that come with each transaction. This helps you gauge how much in fee you need to spend to have your tx confirmed. If there's a backlog of txs, and you want yours to go in as fast as possible, you should set a high fee. But currently, transactions down to &lt;5 sat/b are being confirmed, so no point in going much higher.
This is very short... it's still early days for bitcoin, so you'll need to educate yourself about all of this. Will be some time before it's all super smooth.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:10:35
OK, your stupidity is truly impressive. Here, just so you can read, and think about it again:


@_date: 2017-09-18 15:13:42
That piece offers a half baked opinion, one that rides the whole "*BTC now only has 50% dominance, and that's because high/fees/small/blocks/favourite argument against Core*" train of thought. And this is what is the fundamental flaw.
Very shortly. Did you ever talk to people who are/were skeptical of cryptos, tried convincing them to get into bitcoins only to get a reply like "I can't afford a single bitcoin, I'll just get ETH/XMR/DASH/LTC instead"? It's called "unit bias", and it happened to me MANY times. Guess where that money goes?
Let's talk "market depth" and "market cap". If you pour $1m into BTC you will increase the market cap by ~$1m. However, if you pour the same $1m into a shitcoin, the market cap can easily increase by $10m! This is tricky to see for people who don't know how markets work, but it basically has to do with market depth and liquidity: *there is no real liquidity in any other crypto!*. Or better, there was none before Jan-Feb this year, so any money pouring into alts would necessarily boost the market cap of all the shitcoins **disproportionately**. 
Another way to look at this: You cannot pull $10m out of altcoins without MAJOR price disruptions, but you can take $10m out of bitcoin and none would be any wiser for it.
Maybe when you wrote that piece you really believed that bitcoin's market cap is declining because of the increasing fees and "reduced" utility, but that's misguided at best. Truth is there is no viable alternative (now) to bitcoin in real life. As in, you can live off bitcoin, but you cannot live off any other coin. And many of the problems bitcoin is facing are arising precisely because bitcoin HAS scale, a dream for every other altcoin. 
Please rethink about your argument in light of all the most recent events: Tx spam attacks on the network, 5sat/b tx confirming in the next block when no spam, my point above on market cap and BTC dominance, and perhaps most importantly, the centralization pressures that 8MB blocks bring. Yes, it's 8MB, we already have 4MB blocks. 4MB &gt; 2MB, which is bad enough. Pushing this to 8MB adds a lot of centralization pressure. Would love to see an argument that addresses all these points.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:09:38
And yet no miner is switching, except for BCash.
But you are avoiding the question... It would seem you have no answer. I'm sure you'd happily shove a shitcoin in my face, if there was one that outperforms Bitcoin in all the metrics I mentioned. Because there's none? Rethorical question, the answer is obvious.
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:03:42
Flawed reasoning, completely.
Of course it's an assumption, it's the most "neutral" assumption possible. The assumption of uniform distribution of coins is just to show that even in the **most benign** case, POS will lead to accumulation into the hands of few. And that is **without taking any other currency into the game**. Start with an economy of POScoins ONLY, distribute uniformly, and let time run it's course. You end with most coins in the hands of few simply because some people will spend more than others, it's human nature. It also hurts the economy as one way to accumulate coins is to hoard. So you don't spend, you don't invest, you don't take risks... which are the bloodline of economy. POScoin economy dies.
That's not the case for POW. In an economy of POWcoins only, start with an equal distribution of coins **and** ASICs, and let time run it's course. The system is stable as is, coins keep getting uniformly distributed, AND the economy can function since you have no real reason to hoard coins. If you want more coins, you need to spend your POWcoins to buy/make more ASICs. Which is what economy is all about... you need to invest in order to make more money. And investments are always risky... the risk that you'll end up with LESS money. POWcoin economy thrives.

Personal opinion, I think you're overdoing it. Play the video, answer questions, point them to this sub and bitcoin.org, that is. Then let them do some research, and come back to you with more questions.
The above will actually include some of what you describe, like how to get BTC (gemini, bitstamp, other exchanges not supporting NYA), how to store/use and so on. Ask them what do they want to do with those BTC, that will tell you what you should recommend. For hodlers, cold storage. For spenders, phone app. Mostly I'd say answer their questions, don't overload them with info they are not hungry for.

Scaling on chain cannot be done. A quick calculation tells you how large the blocks would have to be to reach VISA capacity. Add to that MasterCard and American Express. And then possibly double, or triple this number. Why? Because the credit card companies don't touch poor countries across the world.
Now the blocks will be giant. This is not scalable. Besides, do you really want all your condoms and hair products forever enshrined into the blockchain?

Thanks for the link, I understand the bitcoin ecosystem and the interplay between the various players, but that was still a good read.
S2X is not concerning because miners can impose their will on me, nope. The issue is more subtle and devilish. This time it's not just the miners, there are some pretty big economic players behind it. And yes, I understand that does nothing to my wealth sovereignty, the problem is one of **name**, or **brand**, if you prefer. If a bunch of deep pocketed businesses start to call S2X 'bitcoin', and selling it as such, then a newbie entering cryptos will be buying S2X, under the guise of bitcoin. This is the reason no replay protection has been added, people realize that with it, they are essentially forking off. No replay protection means it's an attempt to **be** bitcoin, and not a fork.
This is the danger here, S2X is basically an attack on the brand. That is really not needed, and could disrupt bitcoin adoption for an unnecessarily long time.

Suspect your experience is common today for the reasons you mentioned, a ton of new users are being onboarded. Keep in mind this is still early days, so even businesses are taken aback. I myself gave up registering with GDAX in the past when part of the verification involved questions like "Which of these celebrities are you friends with", or something equally idiotic to this extent. Not kidding!
I registered with Gemini in early July and it was a smooth sail. Uploaded all the docs, and after 10 days got approved. Yes, it took 10 days because of massive numbers of new clients, but not a single further interaction with them, and I was done. Not too keen on their website, no price chart and such, but overall a great exchange.

This is dumb.
The money (bitcoin) will not be controlled by anyone. But businesses are subject to laws, and rightly so.
You, as a dev, can do whatever you want. Create a new coin, S64X? Your right. Try to sell it hard? Yup, totally fine. Lobby everyone so they start accepting it? You got it. But a business cannot do whatever it wants. A business cannot give me silver if I store gold with them. They have a fiduciary duty to their customers, and will end in jail if they defraud me. 
This is what keeps the game clean-ish. If every business were to do whatever they wanted just because decentralisation, it'd pretty soon turn into anarchy.

You are ignore the key question... what prevents ALL MINERS from agreeing to a block reward increase? Not one, ALL of them together. They would ALL benefit from it, so why don't they do it? 
Answer: Non-mining full nodes.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:33:03
That is not true. You are spreading mis-information at best, and FUD at worst.
Miners are only a small part of the bitcoin economy. A very important one, but nowhere near "the only measure we have". Full economic nodes are the nodes that count. If you run a full node, miners can fork themselves off, and sell their forked off coins to... no one. It's the full nodes that validate every transaction, and if miners start producing invalid, forked off blocks, my full node will reject them.
The market can be better assessed by the nodes being run. And currently there are more 0.15 nodes than btc1 nodes, like 10 days after release. And 0.15 nodes disconnect btc1 nodes automatically. 
The bigger threat of now vs previously is that some really big economic players support 2X. That was not the case previously. If all the large economic nodes insist on 2X, it will split the chain again. My node won't accept 2X blocks. This is not good because the network effect is reduced.
Finally, if you believe that 2X vs NO2X is anything but a political move, you don't really understand what's going on. This is all about controlling bitcoin, not block size.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:55:35
For some reason it seems like Bcash is more profitable to mine than BTC, and this was the case in the past day. So hash power migrated, and this slowed down the BTC network. In the last 6hrs there were only 21 blocks found instead of ~36. Over 24hrs, block rate was ~4.9/hr instead of ~6.
In short there's a bit of a backlog, be patient.
@_date: 2017-09-22 10:28:14
Okay. An why can't it happen? What will prevent the fork?
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:43:38
Lololol You don't understand bitcoinomics.
If what you say was true, miners would decide absolutely everything. Including NOT activating SegWit. Including bigger blocks. Including whatever other nonsense they may dream about.
Why don't they do it? Because they cannot.
If miners start mining a fork, which they can do at any time, bitcoin full nodes will **simply not accept these altblocks**. So the miners are mining a coin that is not bitcoin, and cannot sell it to anyone. Meanwhile, the bitcoin network suffers a bit because of backlogs, but eventually diff adjusts and life goes on as before, without the miners.

After the recent FUD I'm not the biggest fan of Jamie Simon, but in the past he made some intelligent remarks. One of them is that **moving money costs money**. And this is as true as it gets, better get used to it.
On chain transactions will always cost something, and that's not bad. It's how you scale that's the real question. And scaling on chain has so many problems, it really shouldn't be even considered after all this time spent debating it. And scaling off chain will give you those close to zero fees. Just think of passing a paper wallet to someone - instant confirmation, zero on chain fee. (OpenDime is a much safer option, passing paper wallets is obviously unsafe.)

Oh dear... do you have a "brain on/off" button? It's time to flick it to ON.
SW activated a month ago, and 5% of SW transactions just show what a GREAT support it has. There are very few businesses that implemented SW already, and the reason they did not do it yet is not because they don't support it, they do and I'll get back to this, but because it's a non-trivial change on their end. Their IT need to implement, test and eventually release. You clearly never worked for a company with &gt;10 people or you'd know this shit.
Similar story with wallets. They have to implement SW, and make it the default "new" address for receiving coins. Currently most wallets will still give you a legacy address, when you generate a new one. 
And even then, **receiving** coins on a SW address is NOT a SW tx. Sending coins from a SW address is. This means for 100% SW tx, you'd need to move all the coins in existence into SW addresses first, and then start moving those coins. Think about it.
As for why the businesses are interested in SW... money. Many businesses now pay the tx fee themselves when you withdraw coins. With SW, they will spend less. But again, they must first receive the coins on SW addresses, and then start saving. Takes time.
5% actually shows you the great support SW has in the grassroot support crowd. Which is a lot, and growing, especially since not all the wallets have SW yet.

You are realising the loss to offset against the gain, and you are back into BTC, with a possibly bigger stash, and no tax to pay until you sell for fiat, instead of being on the hook for the gain.
I don't think you considered my trade in detail. It's basically the example you wrote down, with the starting price @ 6k instead  of 10k. Without the BTC &gt; ALT/fiat trade at the end, you are on the hook for taxes. But if you DO the final trade, you offset the gains.

Of course I can, and I do. There are normal oscillations in the system, and we're experiencing that now. And it's not the same "high fees" experienced half a year ago, we're talking about $1, if I believe the post above. Not what we want, but compare that to banks transfer fees for anything above $100. And will only get better with larger SW adoption.
Perhaps most importantly, you seem to want a giant global currency with cheap fees and insta transactions **now**. Sorry to disappoint, but bitcoin is only a 3rd grader. L2 solutions are being built as we type. We'll need some more time before we reach adulthood, ready for mass adoption. In the meantime it's growing pains. It's unfortunate, but consider that it took VISA 50yrs to be fully mass adopted. And it took fiat some 400yrs for that. Give the kid some time to grow, it's showing great potential.

If you have X BitCandy and give them to someone else, everyone will see how many candies you gave them. If you try to mix-and-match your candies, but people know you initially had X, it is basically impossible for you to be truly anonymous when you transact candies. Knowing the amount of candies is the bane to anonymity for your candy transfers.
"Bulletproofs" are a way to hide the amounts being sent, and which allows anyone to verify that the transaction is still valid (you are not trying to send more candy than you have, etc). It also doesn't require any "trusted third party", which is what other schemes need (e.g. SNARKS, used by ZCandies.)
The problem is that such verifications are slow. Until now... where if you do a verification of 16 hidden candy txs, it will take you the same time as if you were to verify a non-hidden candy txs. This is great, because it means it might be feasible to implement in BitCandy soon-ish, and performance would not suffer. 
At the end, you'll be able to mix your candy and nobody will know if you're trading them for lollipops, a suckling bottle, new diapers or a super cool upgrade to your pram.

1) Yes. From the paper: 


network be able to support a high rate of churn [9], that being the rate at which
nodes enter and leave the network. Indeed, as the Bitcoin network grows, we can
expect the same from the heterogeneity of its constituent nodes. For example,
nodes may enter the network from financially restricted or developing countries,
with intermittent electricity supply or Internet connectivity; small business and
hobbyists may choose to run nodes during off-peak hours, or on cheap, legacy
machines; finally, some users may wish to run nodes on mobile devices such as
laptops. Therefore, the network must be able to quickly propagate blocks to all
current nodes, even as some of these nodes enter or leave the network.


in the presence of node churn, identify practical weaknesses, and propose an
improvement that promises to help block propagation protocols reach their full
potential. We first conduct an experiment on the recovery (convergence) time of a
Bitcoin node joining the network. The experiment shows it may require as much
as ten days to stably attain a 90% effectiveness of the compact block protocol,
even with full uptime and connectivity. Next, in a second set of experiments, we
show that when a node is accessible 90% up-time of the time (i.e., repeatedly,
9 minutes connected, 1 minute down), the effectiveness of the compact block
protocol drops by roughly 50%, meaning that the node will frequently request
additional information from its peers after receiving a new compact block, and
this may cause additional delays in block propagation.


protocol, dubbed FalafelSync
2) Would say yes, but didn't review thororughly... From the paper


within Bitcoin core and repeat the second set of experiments. Our experiments
show that FalafelSync dramatically reduces the number of missing transactions
in the memory pool of an intermittently connected node, thus leading to
superior performance by the Compact block and Graphene protocols.

This is the real reason, though it's not necessarily "stupid".
People should understand that banks **don't like** regulations, and AML/KYC **are** regulations. Left to their own devices, banks would happily do business with terrorists, drug lords and other criminals - It's all profit! (That's why I don't think AML/KYC is "stupid".)

You are delusional, no doubts about it. But I'll add that it's because of people like you that we make any progress as humanity.
You are, however, ignoring my argument. Your ability to foresee big changes does not address my point - Regardless how much you would like it to be the case, good code is not the only game in town. By far. Trust me, I wish it was the case, but it's not. Humans are impulsive creatures, not rational ones.
On social organisation, big changes are coming, but to believe people will run everything is, again, delusional. And certainly this shift of power will not happen within a generation. Big battles, with blood being spilled, will be fought before those in power will cede the power.
Finally, in 10 years there will be just as much advertising and marketing as there is now, if not more. Don't know the specific form of marketing, but whether the latest Broadway show will advertise by handing our flyers, by renting digital space in Times Square or by plugging subliminal messages via some VR helmet that connects directly to your brain, that I don't know.

They too like to put something in their wallet knowing it will keep it's value two weeks later. And for them that's Bitcoin, much more than the Govt fiat currency.
How about underdeveloped countries the world over, where access to the banking system is just not available? They would LOVE to get into the traditional banking system, but cannot.

What I said is nothing new under the sun. It's how things are in every company, especially if there's venture capital involved. The CEO's job is to maximise profits for the shareholders, not necessarily please the users. It's the same for ShapeShift.
If your board thinks S2X is the way to go, you'll find 'reasons' to support it, even if personally you may think it's a clusterfuck. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:31:26


Correct. But... as an alt trader, you want to increase your BTC stash. Alts are notoriously volatile, so you could do that, even by making small trades, say a few % profit *in BTC terms* all the time. Again, the goal is to **increase the BTC stash**, not necessarily fiat.
Now consider the trade I pointed out earlier:
Buy 1BTC, BTC @ 6k
1 BTC &gt; 10 ALT, BTC @ 6k (no tax liability)
10 ALT &gt; 1.1 BTC, BTC @ $15k --- Tax liability on $10.5k
Sell BTC &gt; ALT/fiat &gt; BTC now --- Tax credit due to "loss" in Bitcoin, approximately offsetting the tax liability incurred previously.
This WILL reduce your tax bill. The only doubt I just got right now is one of timing... you may have to wait some time before going back into BTC to actually benefit from the tax credit. But if you exclude this last point, it definitely does work, which was my original point.

You know who would lose the most? Bitcoin.
The reason? The new chain would be an altcoin, and the legacy chain would be Bitcoin. And that would be because businesses would not need to do anything to support the legacy chain, including keep calling it Bitcoin. So they would do nothing, and a new coin would be born.

Let me read between the lines here, so the real message doesn't get lost:
*Two extremely and filthy rich people are offering real estate at 15% - 20% discount for Bitcoin. AKA They are trying to get their hands on Bitcoin without disrupting the market by causing a giant price increase because "old money is getting into bitcoin". And they need to tempt you to get rid of the coins, hence big discount.*
This is what we need. When Average Joe says "HODL!!" most won't listen. But when real money starts to talk, everyone starts to listen. Don't let go of those coins, that's not the last you'll hear of rich people trying the get their hands on the coins.

Ask the legacy nodes if they are detecting any changes in the rules.


No. Reducing the block size does not change the consensus rules. But it does become the **new consensus rule once everyone agrees to it**. See? Change can happen, if there is consensus. And the same would be with the 2X fork, if it had consensus: It would be a change of rules that we all agree upon, and call the new coin bitcoin. Again, the trick here is **we all agree on**. We don't all agree on S2X.

This is a nuclear option which might be necessary if miners mess too much with the system.

Seems like the only answers you are getting are from anti-Core, r-btc zealots. Who, btw, also keep mistaking Core with Blockstream. Not the case.
1) Blockstream is working on off-chain solutions, think is mainly for corporations, and they will charge them a fee
2) They can't. The transaction capacity in the form of a block size limit is a limitation of bitcoin. You could increase the block size, that's the obvious option, but it brings all sorts of unwanted effects, mainly decentralization. To maintain the network as decentralized as possible, Core (NOT Blockstream) have been very reluctant on increasing the block size, and focusing on optimizing the blocks space currently available (SegWit, Schnorr, MAST... ) AND on second layer, or off-chain, scaling solutions. But everyone is aware a block size increase will have to come, just not yet... it's really not needed now. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:02:35


This is the key word... as long as my node participates in economic activity, it's a full blown voting member in the ecosystem. And no miner can enforce anything I didn't sign up for on me.
If mining power drops to 10% it will lead to a congested network, that's true. But it's not something that cannot be recovered. 10% means 10 times longer block confirmation times, a max of approximately 5 months. This is not pretty, I know. However, consider the game theoretical background - Miners that abandon will be effectively mining a new coin, the market value of which is very questionable. Like all humans, they are risk averse, and have real costs to pay for (electricity, rent/lease, staff, ...) If you cannot sell those coins, are you gonna go broke or go back to bitcoin mining?
Finally, abandoning the core chain in such great amounts makes it **MUCH** easier to pull a hard fork with PoW change. If **you** were running a business, would you risk putting your multi million dollar investment at risk just to support a new chain *of questionable value*?? Try to answer this, don't ignore the question. What would you do?

It doesn't matter that they cannot control what people do. It doesn't matter that the system is decentralized. None of that matters when the shit hits the fan. The only thing that matters is that "we need to punish someone to show these cypherpunks they cannot mess with our money". And you go after whoever is the easiest target. Core a prime candidates.

You don't get it, do you? OK, so what would happen if 95% of the miners forked away, *but no one else did*? I'll tell you what. The miners would very quickly be back.  
If no economic node accepts the miners blocks, they are mining their own altcoin, with no one to sell it to. Period. And they know it. The economic chain? Many things can be done to get back to normal... say a hard fork with change of PoW and adjusted difficulty. Yes, for a bit the situation would be messy, but it would recover. The real losers? The miners.
Oh, and the reason they never got 95% is because they know it means jack shit. Otherwise you'd see miners colluding ages ago: For a cartel, decide what they want, and impose it onto everyone else. They cannot do it.
Forget about the miners. If you don't want S2X, email your wallet provider, or bitcoin business, or whatever. The reason S2X is a threat is because there are some pretty big businesses behind it, not because of the miners.

By doing the trade BTC &gt; ALT/fiat &gt; BTC now that BTC has plunged, you give some of those taxes away, and keep the BTC.

There's a lot of not understanding what happened on this topic... the Fed absolutely did not inject any money *permanently*. And that money will be gone before you know it.
What they did is the lent some money... for 1 day. After 1 day, the loan is over and must be repaid. Now, sometimes they'll need to keep renewing the loan, for another day. And maybe another, and a few more. But that's it. This is NOT quantitative easing, it's to achieve the target rate they set at FOMC. It's so short lived it's has barely any impact on the economy. It also means you **cannot add** the money up like that, it's always the same money.
These loans are collateralized, btw. Over collateralized, even. So for $100bn lent, they get $100+ bn in securities, typically US treasuries. So if anyone doesn't repay the loan after 1 day, they just sell the securities on the market and that's it.

Your understanding of the bitcoin ecosystem is pathetic. Miners don't decide jack shit, and they know it.
If miners could force their will onto the bitcoin ecosystem, they would have done so years ago. That they didn't, tells you something about their real power. It's also why they are partnering up with businesses, aka economic nodes, so they will hopefully pull this off. The true power in the bitcoin ecosystem lies with the full, validating, non-mining nodes because they accept or reject the work of the miners.
Come November, my full 0.15 node will be disconnecting btc1 nodes, and rejecting any blocks produces by non-Core rules. I'm interested to know who will they sell their new S2X shitcoins. Certainly not to me, because that's not the network I'll support.
Also, in case you were wondering why there is no replay protection in S2X, it's because all the players involved are fully aware that what I said is true. And they are trying to maliciously take over bitcoin. But clearly this escapes you.

Core understands full well blocks will need to be raised **eventually**, but there are many efficiencies to implement that will "make blocks bigger" (basically by "making transactions smaller"). After all these improvements, and with **lots of testing**, we should increase the block size.

PoS is so bad... I could write a whole post on it.
It's basically interest on money you don't use. If you are annoyed by the current wealth inequality in the world, that's exactly where PoS would get you.
In essence, it encourages not spending the coins because you get more of them the more you hold. Over time you get extreme concentration of wealth. That's not the case for PoW.

I never said I will trade my BTC... But this is a very long, and very confused rant you go on about. The essence is contained in my post. But previously you claimed S2X can **only** gain value by selling BTC for it. 


This is not true. I countered that by saying it can gain value as people buy it for fiat. And if exchanges are willfully going to disrupt the ticker I agree it's fraud, which is why they most likely won't. But it could boost the price of S2X and create a lot of chaos, as miners swing back and forth, people lose money and so on. This shakes the credibility in BTC to the 'xerox = copy' and 'kleenex = tissue' crowd.
So again, no, hodling is not enough.

Such mis-information. After SegWit activation, fees started to drop like a brick. (Excluding yet another 2 week "period of very high activity" in August.) I myself sent all my coins to SW addresses, and paid a TOTAL fee of ~$0.90 for 5 tx (!!!), I even made a post about it. With SW, fees are even lower! And this is less than one month after SW is live. Plenty of data that demonstrates this. 
You also sound like a very sensible and rational guy: Let's buy some time for L2 solutions! Sounds very sensible, not being sarcastic, it really does sound sensible. But what this misses is why did miners block SW activation for almost two years??? That was golden time for L2 solutions to be developed, and we wasted it! So now what do we do? Sure, let's lay one clusterfuck (2X) on top of the other (SW delay)!!! Let's fix one self inflicted problem with another!
You want to know who caused the $10 fees? Miners, by blocking SW. Why are we rushing down the rabbit hole of yet another miner induced clusterfuck?

I actually respect the guys following Bcash A LOT MORE than any S2X proponents. The BCash+NoSegWit approach is certainly one possible way forward. I think it's doomed to become a centralized currency, which is why I don't support it, but at least it's a clean (and relatively amicable) split. 
*Honey, I think we should get a divorce. No hard feelings, we're just not compatible anymore.*
Basically the best possible divorce outcome.
S2X is different. S2X is insidious, it's fighting long legal battles in the courts trying to steal from each other. Using dirty tricks. That's not clean, that's punching below the waist. That's just ugly. 
And then you have "visionaries" here saying "If we need the Govt to step in, it's a failed coin." No it's not. It's possibly the only thing that will keep them out of my pockets!
As much as I disagree with Bcash, I am **so much more strongly against S2X**.

Incorrect. If price goes down, miners with the most expensive power will get priced out and stop. Diff adjusts and makes mining *cheaper*, bringing some of the miners back in. If price keeps falling, an equilibrium will be found where, perhaps, only the miners with the cheapest power will mine. But mine they will. No need for "new blood".
Remember one thing - Bitcoin was $200 and miners were around with **much less efficient** equipment. With current gen equipment, there's plenty of room to go. And if Bitcoin goes back to $1, people will bring out the GPUs. And enthusiasts will keep using it.
Last thing, you seem to ignore the role of fees in all of this, which further strengthens the network. As miners drop out, fees go up. Which makes mining more profitable, so brings miners back in. This effect must be included to what I described above.
For Bitcoin to completely die a really hard core and catastrophic event must happen. Price dropping 90% is not enough. It happened before.

You can close out the channel at any point without consent from the other party... And that's because to transact on LN you'll have to exchange digital signatures. The pair of digital signatures can be used to unlock the funds by either party.

The end result would be a mix of empty to healthy blocks? Honest miners would always mine on top of whatever is the latest block, and the malicious miners would have to re-mine the healthy blocks and a new empty block. Guess it depends on the proportion of malicious mining to healthy mining.

But he didn't seem to suggest an alternative either...
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:40:46
You're right... I did read that upside down. My bad.
Let's play the "all miners leave" scenario, that's the key to your claim. Well, what would happen in this case is simple: Miners do, in fact, mine their own coin, defined on their own set of consensus rules. The history is the same, though. So in practice, the miners would hard fork from the original chain. **But it's a different coin!!** For two reasons, one it doesn't follow the legacy consensus rules. Two, because there is no consensus - Only the miners would be mining a new coin, and no one else. 
What about the original chain? It would come to an abrupt stop, yes. But that doesn't mean it'd be dead. An emergency PoW change with diff adjustment would, in that case, simply get the network up and running again.
Result? Two separate networks, two separate coins.
Now this is assuming all the miners would not budge and stick to the new rules. In practice, this would not happen because miners have real costs, and if they can't sell their coins, they can't pay for the costs. That's the real reason miners don't go away... they could have forked away years ago, but they didn't. Mining on different consensus rules makes it a different coin, not bitcoin. The bitcoin rules are enforced by the non-mining full nodes, which keeps the miners honest, and also allows them to sell their coins and make a profit.
But you again dodged the question: If ALL miners collude, who is to prevent them from doing so? Is there anything in place that would prevent miners from colluding? That's a key piece of the game theory behind bitcoin. And you don't have an answer to that.
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:44:03
You are missing the big picture... if you think there would be no reaction from people losing hundreds of millions, you are not living in the real world. I've said it in the post, bitcoin would come under attack from so many angles that it would not survive as a result of this.

If it's real, it must have a QR code, or BTC address on it. Not only the public address, but the private address as well, else it's all pointless.
You'll need to read up about private vs public addresses, it's all still very early technology and not yet super user friendly. But if you have a public address (or a QR code) you can check that address to see if there's any coins there. You can use something like [blockchain]( - Just enter the public address in the search box.
If it's legit, you'll see how many coins are there AND there should be a private address somewhere. That private address you must keep away from prying eyes. One thing: Not your private address, not your bitcoin. And if it is real, you're probably better off storing the coins on a paper wallet. Or just put that physical coin somewhere very safe.

Dude, your understanding of the bitcoin ecosystem is appalling. Instead of making snarky remarks that fake confidence, you'd do much better at re-reading the article and understanding what it says.
Miners don't control anything. They are trying, but they don't. If I run a full node *without mining*, and a miner is sending me blocks for their own forked-up coin, my node will simply reject them, and their blocks+coins will be lost. A parallel market may develop for the new coins, see big-block-fake-bitcoin, but that's not the original coin. And you know why? Because my *non-mining full node would reject all their idiotic coins*, that's why.

You seem to be missing the key point of bitcoin, which is "Don't trust, verify." That is, you run a full node instead of trusting someone else to do it. Put yet in other terms, the incentive to run a full node is not to make money, but not to lose it. Lose it slowly through, say, monetary policy someone else come up with. In the fiat money world this happens through inflation, and you can't do much about it. Without running a full node, you are at the mercy of others who may just as well decide to increase the money supply...
Running a full node protects your wealth instead of increasing it. If you don't see this as a good enough incentive, talk to people who like to save money, and what happened to their savings over the years.

This would address the issue, but the problem with it is that it's coming a bit too late. New players are coming to mining which are not related to Bitmain. The two Japanese giants, for starters. I also think it will not take AMD and Nvidia too long to come out with something on their own.
With giant investments ($100s mm) into SHA256 mining, pulling the nuclear trigger is very contentious. People will get annoyed if you brick their hardware before it even started mining, and you may think that "open source" and so on will protect you, but it won't. Your ass will end up in jail.
The game is way too big now, and legal consequences are becoming real. Not sure anyone is willing to do that.
On the bright side, more players in the ASIC game means more decentralization. We just need to hang in there for a bit longer.

It also allows miners to operate with a lot more certainty... they sell futures, locking in the profit, if they don't want to gamble on the future price of bitcoin. 
They know their current costs, but don't know the future price of bitcoin. (Could be up, or could be down, even if in the short term.) So if they prefer stability, can hedge the price fluctuation away.

Lol Not really getting defensive, you made a blanket statement that bears no weight whatsoever on the argument. Your reply is different, hence a more elaborated reply.




You also seem to miss the point. I'm not arguing on FOMO, but on calculated risk-return. There's a reason why people tell you "more stock early in life, more bonds close to retirement". Depending on everyone's risk tolerances, bitcoin does belong in an investment portfolio. And yes, the same can be said about everything. The real question here is what is the *subjective* probability of a possible outcome. If you strongly believe snake oil can go to the moon, then you're a fool for not betting on it. (A fool, or just someone who does not have the guts to put the money where the mouth is.) Personally I acknowledge that of all the possible states the world will be in in 50 years there is one state where snake oil is very valuable. Personal assessment of probability? Absolutely negligible... so not investing.
So you want to play semantics games, be anal and tell me "people just don't assign a high enough probability to invest in bitcoin!"? Sure, go ahead. But I'm not interested in playing games, or entertaining petty debates.

It would lead to centralisation of the legacy chain, which many people, including all the exchanges, would continue to call bitcoin. It's basically handing bitcoin away for free to a bunch of corporate interests.

@_date: 2017-10-04 18:17:45
It's not. And that will become obvious when the first 2x block comes along, which will be rejected by the 1x nodes. Which should be the very first block of the fork, think that's the condition: Don't mine anything until a 2X block comes along.
So yeah... 2X is not the real thing. It's an altcoin.

No, not at all. Most people don't want to control bitcoin, just make money. Much like most people don't want to control the USD/EUR/GBP/JPY or gold... people are very happy to make money without controlling anything.


False. UASF is what pushed SegWit through - The very real threat of users start rejecting non-SegWit blocks. That's a powerful economic incentive. I know I installed my UASF node, and if miners hadn't jumped on board, all their blocks would have been rejected by my node. And like mine, many other UASF full nodes. So they would be selling their non-bitcoin-altcoins to whoever wanted to buy them, but not to me and the others supporting UASF.
As for small miners, you are free to support whatever you please. But the same laws of economics that apply to you apply to the large miners. You have bills to pay, maintenance cost to sustain and need to make a profit. So the claim is you will mine whatever makes you the most money, period. (Unless you have a strong political agenda and are willing to pay money for it, by not earning it whilst mining.) And so will the big miners.
Finally, the "hate" is not towards all the miners. This community fully recognizes the importance of miners and appreciates the service provided. There are miners that are much appreciated here. But this community has a specific distaste for miners who are (likely) spamming the network, blocking progress, and trying to "fire core", the very people that made bitcoin what it is today. And the biggest blockchain experts on the planet. 
If you act against the community, you should expect a push back. The larger the attack, the stronger the pushback.

If bitcoin is under sustained attack from the miners, they PoW change is definitely an option. But it's the nuclear option... you know, the kind of threat that nobody really ever pulls because it would destroy the whole thing? So miners wouldn't attack too much because it could lead to PoW change, and users don't trigger PoW change because miners are not attacking.

You just put out there for people to see that you don't know how the system works.

They must be able to buy the real thing, or be told explicitly this is not the real thing. So if you are selling me S2X as bitcoin, you are committing fraud, your ass will get sued, and rightly so.
The S2X crowd knows this... which is why they are not implementing replay protection, that would be a clean break and nobody would object too much to it. S2X claims to be an "upgrade"... so still the real thing, just "upgraded". It's not, it's an altcoin. And if you let the market decide, the battle is already lost for S2X **because** of the brand name: Nobody knows about this B2X coin, but everybody knows about bitcoin.

Just one technical reason, not enough testing. Adam Back called for a hard fork later on: develop L2 solutions, and then increase block size.

There we go again freely interpreting and citing the holy scriptures.
Without replay protection, SPV wallets will just follow the longest chain, regardless of the difficulty. This is what makes this hard fork contentious.


Key importance, difference between soft fork and hard fork. Soft forks make the rules more restrictive, so you are still complying with the old rules. SegWit was a soft fork, so **the new (SegWit) rules are still part of the old consensus rules**. Legacy nodes still accept pre-SegWit transactions **as well as SegWit transactions**.
Hard forks, on the other hand, modify the consensus rules so they are incompatible with the old ones. Legacy nodes will not accept blocks &gt; 1Mb.
So no, SegWit did not change the consensus rules.  But S2X will, not bitcoin.

Txs number is down, but that's normal if you start batching... One txs is used to pay many people, instead of many txs. That's why OP mentioned that outputs are increasing, i.e. more people are receiving BTC, but txs nrs are down.
Basically the story that people are dropping BTC for shitcoins is bogus.

A small block is "easy to validate", meaning it doesn't take a lot of resources to fully validate and propagate. If, as the BCashers wanted, we had big blocks now, no one would have bothered with optimization of block space, and it is very reasonable to expect we'd regularly have, say, 2-4MB blocks. This puts a much bigger burden on the validation. 
It's not about storage, but about network badnwidth (latency first and foremost) and CPU processing power. The bigger the block, the more resources to validate. And on a mobile this means draining the battery real fast and/or simply not being able to keep up with the network demands.
I thought it would have taken a few more years before we'd start seeing full nodes on phones, but I'm very happy to be wrong!

The point is that it's easy to game. Imagine a wallet that, by default, double spends. You broadcast one tx to the merchant and immediately another one to the miner. Always. Even if you succeed 5% of the time, you get a nice discount, overall. So how do you think merchants will react after they catch up? Either reject crypto payments altogether or simply jack up the prices to cover for the average losses. 
It's just not sustainable. Not to mention that every blockchain token out there can do 0-conf, even though BCash decided it was a "feature" on BCash only. It's not.

It's the first step. As more and more merchants accept Bitcoin, some of them will decide to not convert everything into fiat.

Only in very small measure, bordering to the non-material currently. 
A mild inflation, say 1BTC per block, would cause what we already know from fiat currency, a mild inflation in the price. 1BTC/block = 8%, so target price reduction of 8%. That's now. But when price is rising 400% in a year, a 8% inflation is TOTALLY ACCEPTABLE. Yet miners didn't do it. Why?

Don't know "other coins", and not saying the community "fled". Referring specifically to BCash, and the part of the community they took with them. So it was not fleeing, more like parting. And though not particularly large, if you add the BCH txs, you get a better "like for like" picture.

Miners are driven by profit. The real question is what will exchanges do. If they decide to list S2X as bitcoin, then S2X will be sold at the current market price, which will keep the coin alive and kicking, likely displacing the old chain. That's because miners will be able to sell the new coin and pay their costs, and people will be buying the new coin with no idea of what's going on behind the scenes.
Now consider the situation where exchanges *keep the legacy chain as bitcoin*. How much will S2X be worth? Will it even be listed? Assuming it does get listed, which is not guaranteed since it requires an upgrade on the exchanges side, and we take Bcash as example, we can put a tentative value for S2X at .25BTC. This is not enough to keep the mining running, I think it costs $1k to mine 1BTC. So miners are mining at a loss, or paying a huge opportunity cost. How long do you think they can keep going and finance this takeover attempt? Maybe the biggest ones for a while, but the smaller ones certainly not for long.
In my accountants analogy, how long do you think it would take to train another bunch of accountants? And the price for those accountants will skyrocket. Would you not go do accounting for, say, $250k/yr ? Market forces would bring the accountants back, or train new ones real fast.
Miners know this, that's why they **need** others to be on-board. And that's he key behind Charlie Lee's tweet - Miners **on their own** cannot do much.

Your position is pretty obvious once you consider that you don't grasp the working of bitcoin. What you say might well be the original design, but things have changed.

Not true. Signaling was introduced as a courtesy to miners - We're not rushing into upgrades, do your thing at your own time, and once you're done the upgrade will be smooth.
Instead, miners used that to start pulling their own agenda. You can be sure it's never happening again, upgrade by signaling, that is.
Future upgrades could easily be done just by block height, for instance. At a certain block height, the update is triggered. Be ready, or be left behind.

That's because you don't understand network security very well. Don't take it personally, it's not really obvious.
0 fee means I can send 100,000,000 txs of 1sat each for free. So if I have 1BTC I can jus spam the network for fun, at cost 0, and bring the network down, or severely cripple it, because 100,000,000 txs will cause excessive burden on many nodes. And since it costs me nothing, I can keep doing for ever.
Network security is the main reason why on-chain fees should be *high*, and not low. 0-fee? No way. Ever.

You get downvoted for sayting stupid shit, not because "it doesn't fit the narrative".
If you ignore things like the dust limit, the **only** thing that impacts the fee is the competition to get included in the next block, period. If there's (virtually) no competition, i.e. if blocks are not full, then you can use whatever fee you prefer, and your txs will be included in the next block, as a rule of thumb. If the blocks are full, you will have to start competing for inclusion, and the fee will go up.
Perfect examples of this are Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin's blocks are not full lately, and the average fee was very often lower than BCH! (In sat/b, the only relevant metric.) So even large blocks don't guarantee low fees. ETH, on the other hand, is inflationary and fees have been skyrocketing lately.
Btw, you don't present "facts with sources"... you just make claims and present some evidence that explains absolutely nothing. "Look, Steem!" is no evidence for any of your claims. 
If you want to learn something, there's many people here from whom to learn. Or you can be butthurt when your "knowledge" is exposed as flawed and claim the "sub is a joke".

If you switch to 2hrs it just tells you the situation over the last two hrs. And those zig-zag drops you see are blocks being mined/tx being confirmed. Nothing changes.
As I'm writing this, it looks like you'll need to go a bit higher in fees if you want it in the next block. But that's just statistical fluctuation, it took &gt;20min to find a block, so obviously the backlog increases.

That's not correct. If that was the case, miners would do whatever they wanted, for example removing the bitcoin cap of 21m. They would benefit from it, wouldn't they? Instead of 12.5BTC, let's do 13.5BTC... not too bad, is it? And it would benefit ALL THE MINERS.
Why don't they do it? Because those 13.5 coins would be rejected by the non-mining nodes, and would not be bitcoin, but MINERCOIN. And they could not sell that coin to anyone, so they keep mining on the same consensus rules as everyone else. That's the reason this sub always recommends to run a full node, to strengthen the network and enforce the current consensus rules on the miners. 
This narrative that only mining nodes are valid nodes is just flawed. If you care about bitcoin, you want to protect your own money and make the network as strong as possible, you should run a full node.

It is one of the mantras on this sub to not invest more than you can afford to lose. Speaks volumes about the awareness of this community that it may all come crushing down. However, people like you, and I've got a bunch of friends just like you, never consider that they might be wrong. That bitcoin might actually keep growing in value and eventually stay high in value. So you don't invest AND keep saying it'll all collapse thus missing out on potentially very nice profits.

* Once they have enough clout in the ecosystem, they start thinking they can change bitcoin to please their needs... which is when you realize they are anti-bitcoin.

You are delusional, much like an coding artist would be. Brilliant, but autistic.
In the real world marketing means a lot. **A lot.** And though Linux is vastly superior, and has always been, Microsoft won. Because people don't care about a rock solid kernel on top of which you have a clunky bash. People want to click left and right on cute cat videos and masturbate at porn, even if that means experiencing the BSOD once every 15min.


If this was true, I would not use Windows at work, but I do. And like me, 99% of all the other employees on Earth.
And I also never said the status quo will remain, that's you putting words on my screen. But you sure can expect one hellova fight from the status quo. Also, and this is something brilliant coders will probably never get about open source, if something breaks down, who do I call? For open source... post the error on a forum/mailing list, and hope someone will fix it asap. No CEO will take that uncertainty as a foundation to run their business. Trust me, no CEO.
As a student I asked my thesis supervisor why on earth would he spend $2000 for every Dell PC in the computational lab he was tasked to equip, when a DIY PC with better specs cost half that much. I told him I'd put them together for fun! His response? 
*Reliability and customer support.*
At the time it only made little sense to me, now I'm with him. having reliable PCs is worth more than the money you "save". With software the situation is similar - Windows is not necessarily "reliable", but maintenance of a Windows machine is MUCH cheaper and can be done quickly than of a Linux machine simply because people don't know Linux. If code was the only thing that mattered, that would not be the case.

Simple question, but long story... as usual. Trying to be short:
The larger the blocks, the more expensive it is to run a full node, **the backbone of bitcoin AND decentralization**. Suppose blocks are so large you need corporate level investments to run a full node. Yes, if companies across the world ran those blocks it would still be decentralized, but the "degree of decentralization" would be massively reduced. It'd be pretty simple for governments to control it as business owners don't want to get in legal trouble, and big country like the US could impose sanctions on trade partners that don't shut down the full nodes. So arguably not decentralized at all. Compare this with (potentially) millions of users running full nodes: Me, you, your dad, uncle and friends. All over the world. Cannot be killed, period.
Miners would love larger blocks as it ultimately increases the miner fees. 
Users? Benefit from L2 solutions that make fees even smaller than they are now. And this is in the works. No need for large blocks. But we benefit from decentralization, A LOT. Else just use USD/EUR/JPY/GBPO/... no point in bitcoin.
Companies? They "socialize" the cost of scaling bitcoin. How? Larger blocks = no development cost to implement solutions that make bitcoin more efficient. [More details, it's a great post](
Last thing, the block size increase [is not about the size of blocks.](
And I wanted to keep it short.. lol It's worth understanding, though.

Miners perform a valuable service, whether with ASICs or GPUs. But it's just that, a service which they get paid for.
The current problem is mining centralization, but I think that's temporary and will come to an end relatively soon. Two Japanese giants have announced getting into mining AND producing their own ASICs, which are even more efficient than Jihan's. Once that hashpower goes live, we'll be seeing a wave a of much needed decentralization.

POW change is becoming increasingly difficult to pull off. Japanese players are getting into the game, and someone who invests $90m into mining, won't be happy to have some VERY expensive paper weights. Which is why no one will pull the trigger.
As for centralisation, precisely because of new players entering, this won't be a problem in a few years. We've also reached peak technology, so when small guys can buy a 7nm miner and be profitable for some time, many will return to mining. And, of course, just wait for the arms race when governments start mining...

That's the point most people miss... bitcoin had **REAL** value the moment it was traded for REAL goods, without any fiat intermediation. Those two pizzas sold for 10,000BTC gave bitcoin real value. And bitcoin will continue to have real value so long as people are willing to accept it and exchange it for REAL stuff: Services and goods. In short, bitcoin for work.


It would certainly hit the value against fiat, but that misses the big picture. If I'm happy to work for bitcoin, and you're willing to sell me your potatoes for my bitcoin, we don't care about what a bank does or does not do. 
Andreas A said this beautifully: To compare bitcoin to fiat misses the point. It's like trying to value all the internet communications in terms of "phone calls" and "faxes sent". The Internet has value because use it for what it is, the Internet. Not because it replaces phone calls or faxes. In the same way, once the true paradigm shift happens, one bitcoin will be one bitcoin, not *very many USD/EUR/GBP/JPY/KRW/...*.

I am somewhat technical myself and have set up my own "Casa solution" at home, with hardware wallets and multisig. (Don't worry if this sounds mumbo jumbo, it's basically saying I need 2 out of 3 keys to spend coins. So even if you got hold of one hardware wallet of mine you couldn't spend my coins. It's what Casa does.) So don't have direct experience with them as I don't need them.a
What I can vouch for, however, is their chief tech officer. That's Jameson Lopp, and he's held in extremely high regard by the community. As focused on security as it gets, kinda borderline obsessed, and a very strong engineer. He also put together the most extensive source of bitcoin resources (lopp.net, it's a great place to learn). I feel pretty confident in vouching for his integrity to bitcoin. 
And in similar spirit, there was never a complain about Casa pulling out some scam of any sort. Their reputation is sparkling clean. I would use them if I didn't sort things out otherwise.

The fundamental premise here is that for a society to prosper we **need** sound money. Money that cannot be inflated away. Every time this was done in history, the result was misery. And it doesn't have to do necessarily with fiat, paper money. It's a long story, so Google will be your friend.
Bitcoin **IS SOUND MONEY**. The problem, of course, the biggest challenge is to get mass adoption. People need to start saying "I want to be paid in BTC", and that's not easy. It's actually freaking difficult. (But we're getting there...) It also won't happen over night. And I also can't give you timelines and such. What I can do is try to describe the process on how this could happen.
First there's a bunch of "deluded crazy lunatics" that decide/see this is actually cool stuff. You know, the Satoshis, Hals, Nicks and such. They spread the word and, eventually, a random guy, let's call him Laszlo, buys two pizzas for some Bitcoin. Then more and more people start getting on board, and the Bitcoin price starts going up. But it's all very speculative with prices crashing hard. However, people understand that the reason for prices crashing is because people sell. What if no one sold? Price would not crash, by definition. (It's hypothetical.) And so the idea of HODLing is born. And as more and more people hodl, the price, over time, becomes more and more stable. With stability businesses start using it as they become more confident they won't lose money. (Of course, the first one are always  This, slowly, triggers a virtuous cycle of people getting on board and not selling. Over time, people start adopting Bitcoin, especially with some small incentives like a discount from merchants that don't have to pay credit card charges, and a Bitcoin economy emerges. The cycle reinforces itself because people are transacting in Bitcoin **and not selling**. That is, hodling. Next thing you know, the Bitcoin economy is too big to ignore and we, the people, have sound money again. 
It all starts with a few stubborn people hodling...

Let's say ETH and RSK give you the same functionality... should we use ETH or RSK? The answer is straightforward, RSK. That's because ETH dilutes the network effects of bitcoin but RSK further reinforces them.

It is true that there is no admission of guilt for the spam, but there is strong evidence. Literally today I saw a post on the front page of the sub shedding even more light on this. But it's also true that bitcoin adoption did not grow all that much. Think it's 1% of the population in the US that has any bitcoin. And that's not because of high tx fees! It's just damn hard for people to embrace a radically new technology!!
If you've ever tried to convince people about the beauty of bitcoin, you'd know this. I know I've been droning on my coworkers for the past 3 years. You know how many got involved? Zero. A few months ago, two bought ETH, because "I cannot afford a full BTC". 
As for mass adoption, we do hope it gets into the billions, don't talk nonsense. But no on-chain. L2 solutions will make it happen. Scaling on-chain is completely delusional, if you're after a decentralized currency. Unfortunately you just don't see it, or don't care.

Full nodes are what really gives *power to the community*. Don't wanna be a d*&amp;?, but typing stuff on the internet doesn't do much. In bitcoin world, on the other hand, running a full node does, and it does so a lot. Running a full node's importance cannot be overstated.

No, it's not. If you compile my US tax return following the French tax rules, your work will be rejected because it's worthless for the US tax rules. Similar story for bitcoin. You can mine whatever rules out want, but if my full node doesn't agree to those rules, your blocks will be rejected. In other words, your coins will not be bitcoin but some altcoin you won't be able to sell on the market. 
This is why miners have very limited power. They know it, and it annoys the shit out of them.

Nonsense... if you think that every miner pays $5k to mine a BTC you need to re-think this again.
Some miners pay $3k, yet others pay $6k. If price declines, slowly the hash power will decrease - Those that pay most first. As this happens, difficulty will adjust, and bitcoin will continue to chug along. 
Not only that, but as difficulty decreases, the cost of mining one BTC will decrease, which will pull more miners back in. And the diff/cost of mining will go back up. Wash rinse and repeat.

Kind of is, though. Same logic as passphrase on a HD wallet - Deception. So under threat, I would just show an empty balance.
Not saying this is the ultimate security, but it does seem to me it increases deception.
Also, I could generate a huge number of throw away addresses, and then deposit the funds. Checking all of them might just become too costly and burdensome. But I could retrieve them with no big effort since I know exactly the number of throw aways - Just generate the addresses, and discard them until I get to the key number. At that point I have the private key and can move the funds.

They introduced "network fees" after December, IIRC, when fees on Bitcoin were pretty low. Don't want to speculate too much, but I have also not heard of them implementing tx batching, which reduced fees tremendously. With all the traffic they have, they could easily batch and save TONS of money. And if you include SegWit in the calculation, then their behaviour is even worse.
And don't get me wrong, I'm not justifying Coinbase at all, they had even shittier UTXO management AND were charging for fees from always. And Coinbase was/is also heavily flamed by the community, precisely because of this. On the plus side, CB implemented both tx batching as well as SegWit, but BitPay is still doing jack.
BitPay deserves all the heat they are getting. They made a heavy bet, S2X/big blocks, and now are doubling down. Maybe Roger being one of the investors has something to do with it?

This statement is inconsistent with the analysis presented by Bitrefill. If it's true that only a few wallets don't support BIP70, then why did BitPay lose ~50 of their traffic since introducing it?

You're going to the very core of the problem here, great question! And the answer is 
**Don't trust, verify.**
Each and every (full) node validates absolutely every transaction in the network, not just the block hash. And when a transaction is found to be invalid, it rejects the block and bans the peer transmitting it! The result is that illegal blocks do not propagate very far, and rogue miners don't get paid. Which keeps miners honest! 
This is the principal issue bitcoiners insist on, and the reason for many a discussion. Whenever people say "We must keep the cost to run a node as low as possible", this is the reason. If validation costs too much, miners could indeed start playing dirty tricks like this with impunity.

You are right bitcoin is difficult to get, and asking questions and being shut down is not pleasant. But that's not what the sub is for anymore, for better or worse. At least not the "bulk do the sub". 
Noob questions generally go in the "Daily mentor questions" threads, where people are a lot more tolerant. Or in r/bitcoinbeginners. The reason is that all the noob questions have been answered so many times it can get a bit annoying to answer all the time. It becomes just easier and more fun to leave a snarky comment. If you post in the appropriate threads/subs, you'll get a much better experience.

I'm not super technical, so this may be a bit off... but think of the "footprint" of the transaction on the blockchain. A normal transaction has a different footprint from a multisig one, so just by looking at these footprints, you can tell which coins are locked in multisig vs single sig. New improvements in will hide this fact, and every transaction will have the same footprint. Much better privacy.

95% miner signaling was a courtesy to the miners.
Everybody understands miners play an important role in the system, and as a courtesy it was decided to release the software and wait with the upgrade until miners are prepared, to not disrupt them. Perhaps realising their own powerlessness - miners perform a service and get paid for it (!) - they saw this as an opportunity to abuse this and us it to get more power than it actually competes them. They didn't like SegWit, so they stalled. Luckily we're beyond that now, and in the future you can be pretty sure we won't see any other major improvements activated with that mechanism.
That's why Charlie Lee says we'll finally find out that miners have no power, come November.

Absolutely incorrect.  It's a very common misconception, but it's also absolutely false.
Non-mining full nodes validate blocks, and reject non-valid blocks. If miners change consensus rules, their blocks will be rejected by the rest of the network. In practice, they start mining an altcoin, which they won't have anyone to sell to.
Non-mining full nodes keep miners honest.

What CB does is sell your coins on the market, (pocket a fee) and then deposit fiat to your bank account.
You can see bitcoin as two things in one: money proper, like gold, and a (rudimentary) payments network, like PayPal. In practice this means when you have bitcoin, you don't need another payments network on top to send it to others! And that's the beauty of it, no third parties needed.

You are again playing with semantics. Call it "road map", call it "technical guidelines", the essence doesn't change: 
There are various ideas on how to increase the capacity, and a hard fork to increase the base block size is on the list.

And that's why they are against the hard fork now.

Mem(ory)Pool: It's the set of unconfirmed transactions, waiting to be included in a block. It lives in the "memory" of nodes and not in the blockchain (yet).
It matters because it gives you an idea of bitcoin adoption/traffic. Mempool empty, no traffic. Mempool exploding, a lot of traffic. 
People also look at the mempool to estimate/guess the tx fee to pay to have a tx confirmed soon-ish. If the mempool is empty, you can pay dirt cheap fees and your tx will be confirmed in the next block or two. If the mempool is exploding **and you want your tx confirmed in the next block** you'll need to pay very high tx fees. However, if the mempool is exploding **and you are happy to wait** you can still pay a low fee, and your tx will be processed after all the high-fee tx are confirmed.

Disagree. If exchanges list S2X for fiat, hodling BTC will not impact the S2X price at all. Even worse, if S2X is listed AS BTC, then we have a problem. 
Running a full node mitigates the above.

Roger is a master sociopath, lying and even crying whenever is opportune. (There's an interview where he actually cries...)
The situation, as always, is a lot more complex. I'll try to be as short as possible. One, what happens when the block reward dwindles down to insignificance? Answer: [All sorts of bad stuff]( Take the time to read the paper if you're not afraid of technicalities, it's illuminating. The short of it is, miners have all sorts of ways to game the system which leads to the demise of Bitcoin. How can we avoid that? Unfortunately you will probably no like the answer - With a constant and persistent backlog of transactions to incentivize miners into not gaming the system. This means, in practice, a fee market.
Second, blockchains don't scale, period. I don't care what Roger and his army of brainwahsed followers say, blockchains don't scale. Note: They don't scale IF you want to maintain decentralization. If you're happy to give up that and end up with a centralized system run by giant miners, sure... just increase the block size and you're done. But if you want to maintain decentralization, without which Bitcoin is actually pointless (because using slow and inefficient databases that run on a centralized server is fucking stupid) then blockchains just don't scale. So what do you do? Two things - You optimize the available space as much as possible (so instead of making blocks bigger you make transactions smaller.... mind blowing, I know). And you push most transactions off chain - LN, sidechains, drivechains, and so on. 
Once you put these two things together, you end up with a pretty awesome and promising roadmap. Large transactions will happen on-chain, and the fee will be high. (It's not entirely obvious, but the high on-chain fee is basically insurance for network security - It guarantees miners won't leave for another coin.) For small purchases, on the other hand, you use off-chain txs like the LN... which is so stupidly cheap it's untrue. Still boggles my mind. And how do you get money on the LN? You'll probably end up using a service that can fund your channels by making a batched tx for, say, 20 people, thus reducing that on-chain fee to VERY acceptable levels.
More could be said, I hope I was able to give you a flavour for the complexities that are behind the roadmap Bitcoin has adopted. And this was a community decision, people understood the problems and embraced the roadmap. Only a small bunch of delusional religious warmongers embraced big blocks as the solution to all Bitcoin's problems. You can find them in r-btc.
Last thing... don't take it personally if I'm being forward and rude. It's simply that Roger's poison is draining, and he seems to have an infinite supply of it!

Welcome to the future, and it's great to see you're getting educated about this wonderful revolution!
1. Do not touch ANYTHING from blockchain dot info or dot com. It's an absolutely terrible company, and one that tried to fuck up bitcoin more than once. Just avoid. Likewise, avoid
  * blockchain dot info/com (repeated for clarity)
  * bitcoin dot con (typo intended, it's a con website)
  * BitPay (similar breed of scammers)
  * ShapeShift (same as above)
  * conbase (again typo intentional... for similar reasons as above)
  * ... 
  
2. The most bitcoin way to get bitcoin is probably bisq, but that's probably too messy right now for beginners. My suggestion, Cash App. They are doing good work for bitcoin, and the CEO is a big fan of bitcoin.
3. Exchanges are virtual market places where buyers and sellers meet to exchange goods. In this case, bitcoin for fiat and the reverse. It's one possibility for you to get bitcoin, though at 17 they will prob want your parents to be involved. For future reference, some good exchanges are Bitstamp, Gemini (though kinda expensive to trade), Kraken and Bittrex. The latter is not as prominent, but they have no history of scams, unlike most. Binance is also an exchange, and many people use it, but I personally don't like it. It's also mainly used for trading altcoins, which you should avoid (don't fall for "the next bitcoin").
4. Don't worry about this now. If you get some bitcoin you should not even consider selling for ~10yrs. By then things will change and you'll be savvy enough to know where and how. I'd instead suggest a hardware wallet to store your coins. Now this can be expensive, more than the coins you're planning to buy, so maybe out of reach for now. If that's the case, don't worry. Search for "Casa bitcoin storage", their entry level product is free and MUCH more secure than other junk. Just get the app and follow instructions. Your coins will be much safer than on an exchange. (Meanwhile, read about a "seed" and how it's important to recover your funds. You'll come across this when setting up Casa.)
5. Extra, don't dabble with altcoins/shitcoins. They're basically designed to take your bitcoin! Seriously, just don't... You'll thank me in ~10yrs.
Good luck!!

We all want to make money, but some want to do so by controlling bitcoin. And this bunch happens to be some businesses and miners. Let's say 3 years ago there was no split, at least it was not as acute. Hodlers were happy that miners secured the network, miners were happy that hodlers kept hodling and pushing the price up, and businesses were happy that awareness was spreading.
But then things changed. Miners were given way too much power over the future of the protocol, and they took full advantage of that. Blocking cutting edge technology for their own private short-term, short-sighted money making motives. Had SegWit been activated a year ago, there would be no big-block-fake-bitcoin, no "bitcoin evangelists" decrying high fees, and the price would likely be (even) higher. 
It is perhaps unfortunate, but it is human nature to try to control everything. Miners made their move, and the community reacted. The split is real, the attacks on the network are real, and the community reaction is also real. So far, Articles like the OP are dearly needed to spread awareness and put the miners in place. Then, and only then, we can stop "fight within the community".

How can they ensure empty blocks? There is now ~20% of hash power confirmed support for the bitcoin chain. They will continue to generate healthy blocks, so the chain slows down but lives until the next diff adjust. Even if malicious miners were to add empty blocks, that would be ~50% of the blocks on the bitcoin chain. So bitcoin survives. How would their proposal work out?
I'm probably missing something?
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:29:32
If 90% of the hash rate really does leave **permanently**, it will take ~2 months to go back to normal. Bitcoin can survive that.

seems to believe there's no benefit to running a full node, but that's deeply broken. 
Let me ask you this. If you do sports, what is the benefit? It's kinda tricky, and if you think about it, the benefit is generally *avoiding a negative* rather than *obtaining a positive*. Sports benefits you, say, by you *not* being fat, rather than being super-muscular. Or it will benefit you in that you *won't* go to the doctor rather than being able to "bottle your health up and sell it". Point is, the benefit is the avoidance of negative consequences rather than some explicit positive benefit. (I'm simplifying, but I hope you get the point.)
It's similar with a full node. you main benefit is that **no one can change your money without your consent**. Remember, bitcoin is **HARD MONEY**, not a fancy new fintech. The 21m BTC supply is just code, and if all the decisions were made by a few people, that could be changed. There's nothing preventing anyone from changing the code, but if users collectively refuse to run your code, it's as good as dead in the water. And if you're looking for a real life example of this, all you need to look at was the S2X/NYA attempt at changing the protocol by increasing the block size. it failed, miserably. All because of a bunch of crazy UASF + NO2X hat wearing, full node running stubborn people. 
Running your own node puts you in control of the monetary policy, instead of a central bank. Luckily the cost to doing it is small - I run mine on a RasPi, and estimate ~$10/mo of running costs. The benefit is sound money. Giving out this control to miners + businesses is just Central Banking 2.0.

Every full node validates all the transactions. And non-mining nodes that participate in economic activity **are fully fledged economic nodes**. If this was not the case, miners could do whatever they wanted. They would have increased the block size in the past. Or activated BU, at that. They did not do it. Not out of the good of their heart, but because they couldn't. You may wanna think about it.

Again, there's been many reports on actual illicit use on BTC, one issued by the ECB and another one by the UST, both reaching the same conclusion - Only a very small percentage of BTC txs are involved in illicit use. It's something you'd knew, if you bothered fact checking. Again, we see it's not your strong feat.

And just for the record, I think the  people are mostly a bunch of people with too much time on their hands, who don't have to work or they'd be working and not protesting.
Reading some more into it... you're clearly not a nerd. You were probably the jock in high school, enjoying the popularity and the girls. But NOW you probably work for a nerd. Even better, someone you bullied in high school, and he's now making your life miserable. And you'd love BTC to crash and burn NOT because sex traffickers and child pornographers, but just so you could look at your boss and feel superior to him, once again. Your mini-little revenge.
Alas, BTC won't die. It will correct, like it did MANY times in the past, and will continue to exist and be of tremendous use to those who don't have it as good as the western world, whatever that means. And you'll continue to be raw for the rest of your life, because nerds got it right once again.

Last year they were very outspoken about the need to increase the block size because "customers are asking for it" and were more than happy to support S2X. And now, one year after, they still haven't implemented SegWit? They deserve all the heat they are getting.

If nobody can, they would have done it already. Miners don't like SegWit, yet they activated it. They want big blocks, yet we still have small blocks and they had to create an altcoin to get them.
Miners are kept in check by the nodes enforcing the consensus. The real dilemma would not be for non-mining nodes, who can sit idly and spend $5/month on electricity. The real dilemma is on miners, mine a new coin that you have no one to sell to, or go back to the original rules. 
So... perhaps it's better to say that economics keeps miners in check. Economics that is established by the non-mining full nodes.

It's about risk for the exchange, not the buyer nor the seller. Let's say you buy at $10,000 and have $2,000 on account. You can cover the losses all the way to $8,000, but not more. So let's say you have a 1 month-out position. In one month, we've seen this many times with Bitcoin, the price can decrease MUCH more than 20%. Let's say that when your contract expires the price is $5,000. You're on the hook for $5,000, but you don't have that money... this leaves the exchange with $3,000 to cover. Sure, they'll start legal proceedings against you and all, and perhaps after 2yrs they'll get your $3,000. But that's costly and a pain in the neck.
How can you prevent this? You settle daily. Every day the price goes down, they take some of your money to cover the losses. Then, when the price hits $8,000, they will issue a "margin call" - You either put up more money (margin) to keep your position open, or they will close your position. You could meet the margin call because you think the price will recover, and if it does you're good and don't lose any money. Of course, the price could go down more and you lose more. But one thing is for sure, if you don't put up more money, you WILL lose $2,000 because they will liquidate (close) your position. 
That's the KEY difference between hodling and using futures - If you hodl, you don't incur a fiat loss until you sell, they are paper losses. (Just like they are "paper gains" when the price goes up... and also caveat that no one will say "*Oh, you have 100BTC and paid $1m for it, now it's worth $10,000... but still have 100BTC, so who cares, here's your Lambo!*") But with futures those paper losses are very real, and can be irreversible if your position gets closed.)
This brings us to the tweets from that bot. The same logic above applies in reverse - If you short Bitcoin. Then you face margin calls when the price goes up. But when the price goes up as violently as it did today, there's simply no time to put up more margin! So the exchange closes your position, and you lose your margin... all of it! If you had more time you could put up more margin and then risk even more by shorting at a higher price, so you add more sell pressure. But when it's this violent, those losses are like a lightning bolt on a clear sky, nothing can save you. 
That bot is monitoring BitMEX for shorts that are being closed. In the case above, the guy was forced to buy $9,984,230 worth of Bitcoin @ $7,650. (At least that's what those numbers mean to me.) But you don't know how much they lost since you'd need to know where they shorted, what was the selling price. But the position is pretty large, so couldn't have been a small loss.

Please stop talking nonsense. The price crash had exactly jack to do with fees. Jack. Shit.
Is it really that difficult to accept that if ANY asset, yes including BTC, appreciates 3x in less than two months that's fucking unsustainable? Because that's exactly what it was, too much too fast. So it collapsed. Many people in this community called the crash, people who believe in Bitcoin, not shitcoins, called it. Precisely because it was too much. (Of course, no one could have predicted when it would all come crashing down.)
But sure, this is just not comprehensible to you and Ver, even though you "don't like him", so fees are responsible for the price crash. And for Bitcoin's decreased market cap. And for every other bullshit r-btc comes up on a daily basis.

It's more accurate to say that people didn't consider a fork without replay protection in the original design, so that's an attack vector. I'm sure it's being considered now. So yes, this is a dirty trick.

Empty comment. An agreement between part of the community is not an agreement. Even businesses are dropping out of the agreement, so no consensus. Trying to sell that agreement as a community consensus agreement is a dirty trick.

If my idea works, it would make the whole network a lot more efficient, and even reduce the impact on the blockchain as you'd have to open less channels. 


Thank you, I know. But it would also not be a problem if my idea works. Again, fewer channels would have to be opened, with a consequent reduction in the pressure to increase block size.


I know it's still WIP... I'm trying to see if it can be solved in principle or if there's a flaw in my thinking. I'm not sure it works...  There are 2-out-of-2 multisig addresses involved and the requirement for the set up to be trustless for everyone.

* Active supporter/promoter of NYA/S2X
 
 * Think it was one of their engineers leaked that NYA/S2X was nothing else than a plan to "fire Core"; he got fired for leaking this info
 * They were telling their customers it was "necessary" to use the S2X software (btc1) to "upgrade" to SegWit, which was completely false
* After ~11 months, SegWit still **NOT** activated, even though they (claimed they) supported S2X around March 2017. Note: S2X = SegWit + 2MB  - SegWit is **in** S2X
* Mislead customers and favour BCash by imposing "network fees" on payments with Bitcoin, but none of that for BCash

***You cannot scale 10000000x by sacrificing 5% decentralization.***
Sorry kid, you just cannot. Decentralization is a road fraught with pitfalls. It's extremely easy to make a "small" sacrifice here and another "small" sacrifice there. In the long run, they all come back to bite you in the ass in the form of a central "bank". If you cannot see the problems coming down the line because of "*let's just increase the block size this one time*" it doesn't mean there's none, but there are.
 Bitcoin decentralization is everything, or it's not Bitcoin. 
Else we might as well stick with fiat, because that's the flip side. You don't need PoW, the blockchain, cryptography and so on to run a centralized digital coin. 
So no, there won't be any compromises on decentralization. Plenty of other coins out there which will satisfy your desire for compromises. Not Bitcoin.

TL;DR  was pushing BCash propaganda and got shut down by Twitter.
There once was a debate on how to scale Bitcoin. The majority stood behind the devs with the technologically more advanced, but much harder, approach - Small blocks + off-chain txs. 
A minority believes that you don't need to make difficult choices, everything has already been give to the community by Satoshi, all you need is to increase the block size. (This really doesn't work, but that's a story for another day.) So last year on 8/1, this minority decided they've had enough and forked off, creating a new coin, Bitcoin Cash, or BCash.
The problem? Since then they have been hell bent on trying to hijack the Bitcoin name and "brand", by making arguments like "Satoshi always wanted to scale on chain!!!", aka "Satoshi's Vision". And any argument you try to have with them will, ultimately, point you to the White Paper. The ultimate appeal to authority.
One of the tricks they employed was getting hold of the  account on Twitter. Since then,  has been spouting BCH propaganda. Of course, most of the community was pushing back and reporting  to Twitter for mis-representation. (It's OK if you support BCash, but you can't go around saying Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin... it isn't. It just isn't.) Twitter finally took (definitive?) action and closed the account down.
The Bitcoin community is extremely happy, the Bitcoin Cash community is extremely unhappy.
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:00:41
I like the reporter, she did not cave into the "Bitcoin Core" BS Roger was pushing. And she seems to be at least somewhat up to speed with the scaling. OF course, conmen gonna con, so Roger flat out lies saying BCash can scale on-chain. But that's another story.

For instance, try going to r-twoxchromosomes and discuss the social implications of false rape claims. To them, false rape claims don't exist, and you're a sexist pig simply for believing it exists.
Second, I like to think that a **novel** criticism would be discussed openly. See what I did? Novel. Truth is, most of the "bad news" is rehashed old horse s\*\*\*, which has been countered so many times it becomes much easier to simply downvote.

Idiocy. BCH = Bitcoin, 3 years ago. And back then Bitcoin offered neither privacy, nor scalability. And the "microtransactions" were not real mictrotransactions, they were more like "small transactions made every now and then". You certainly couldn't *stream Bitcoin*, which LN does allow you to do.

@_date: 2018-04-22 18:38:00
Abstract: Bitcoin, the arguably most popular cryptocurrency 
to date, allows users to perform transactions using freely
chosen pseudonymous addresses. Previous research, however,
suggests that these pseudonyms can easily be linked, implying
a lower level of privacy than originally expected. To obfuscate
the links between pseudonyms, different mixing methods have
been proposed. One of the first approaches is the CoinJoin
concept, where multiple users merge their transactions into
one larger transaction. In theory, CoinJoin can be used to
mix and transact bitcoins simultaneously, in one step. Yet,
it is expected that differing bitcoin amounts would allow an
attacker to derive the original single transactions. Solutions
based on CoinJoin therefore prescribe the use of fixed bitcoin
amounts and cannot be used to perform arbitrary transactions.
In this paper, we define a model for CoinJoin transactions
and metrics that allow conclusions about the provided
anonymity. We generate and analyze CoinJoin transactions and
show that with differing, representative amounts they generally
do not provide any significant anonymity gains. As a solution
to this problem, we present an output splitting approach that
introduces sufficient ambiguity to effectively prevent linking
in CoinJoin transactions. Furthermore, we discuss how this
approach could be used in Bitcoin today
Our main contributions are: 
1) We show that naive CoinJoin transactions with arbitrary, commonly used amounts allow linking of
pseudonyms. 
2) Based on a concept called knapsack mixing, we present novel output splitting algorithms that hinder linking. 
3) We show that the computational difficulty of analyzing knapsack mixed CoinJoin transactions alone might provide enough anonymity, and that even if the analysis is performed, only a small number of pseudonyms can reliably be linked.

Not true. Txs are NOT valid without signature. If you think they are, try sending one and let is know how it goes. It's old nodes that won't see the signature because it's been moved to a different part of the block, but the new nodes **will** see it and **will** validate it.


This is broken understanding. No one designs security software like that, certainly not core. SegWit works because it doesn't rely on miners good will, much like Bitcoin.

Maybe you're not a fan of BCash, but you sure seem to be spending a lot of time over there. It's not censorship, simply enforcing rules. Many people don't like it, but there are rules, and unlike in that conspiratorial shithole, they are enforced here. For good reason.
I'm no mod, but I'm tempted to say there are two specially carved out rules that will get you banned real quick: One, shill BCash; Two, cry about censorship...

That's the beauty of it, you don't need to do (almost) anything to use it! In your wallet, set all your Bitcoin addresses to be SegWit addresses and have all the coins sent to those addresses. And you're done! Ideally you'd also send all your existing coins to SegWit addresses.
Legacy addresses start with '1'.
SegWit addresses start with '3'
Native SegWit addresses start with 'bc1'.

Shit lol
Same ballpark numbers! Except I did do LIFO, but wasn't as much of a difference. Also, fully reporting, and paying!, the BTC-fiat trades... also LIFO. (My understanding is that FIFO is *not* mandatory... you can choose the method.) So fully consistent. I also overpaid taxes during the year, which kinda softens the blow now.
I hope that they will be lenient since I expect to be one of the few who is actually reporting everything. Fingers crossed...

Don't know how the pruning works, if it happens only after everything has been verified or not. If not, you're good. Else, you'll struggle with disk space.
In terms of trust, you are fully trustless and help enforcing the Bitcoin consensus rules. You'll validate every single txs, and discard the invalid ones.
Finally, you'll contribute the blocks you have available and propagate those. But you'll be useless, at first, to someone who wants to bootstrap the full blockchain.

This is a false story. Just focusing on the last piece, BCash was launched way before S2X failed, and Roger was pushing it from day 1.

Not sure it's a spam attack, at least I'm not confident calling it that just yet. There are not many actual txs happening, compare the nr of txs to the mempool size - They don't grow nowhere near proportionally. And it also stopped relatively fast.
It might be the setup stage, though... Guess we'll have to wait and see. But for now, this looks more like consolidation txs than a spam attack.

The story is false... BCash was created before S2X failed, and Roger started pushing it from Day1. And the reason it was created is the same reason you have now 4 forks of Monero that can still use the ASICs, i.e. to keep the advantage. In bitcoin that advantage was covert ASICBOOST, which was neutralised by SegWit.

That's just an analogy... and as a matter of fact, I should pushed it further by saying "I'm selling you brass for gold, because they are both yellow."
Look, people disagree, this is just a fact of life. So if a minority of people wanna try scaling on-chain, sure... be my guest. The problem comes when you try to kill the main chain in the process, that's something no one will accept, not without a massive fight anyway. 
Do you see anyone railing against Bitcoin Gold/Diamond/Atom/Dark/Private/WhateverFlavourOfTheDay ? No. Why? Because no one gives a rats ass about forks. Unless they start making claims to be "the real Bitcoin". Only BCash does it. And if you start arguing about the white paper, you'll quickly make me think you're just trolling... but I'll reply anyway. Every single one of the other forks, and of those that are yet to come, follows the white paper! That's what started this whole thing!! Yet, there's only one Bitcoin, Bitcoin.
Last thing, though there is no admission of guilt, there's lots of circumstantial evidence to believe that many of the "problematic" episodes we've witnessed in the past on Bitcoin - High fees in Nov and Dec, constantly backlogged mempool for ~2yrs, social attacks on national media like CNBC, and then some - Have all been orchestrated by the same handful of extremely dodgy and questionable individuals. And guess what? These individuals are the biggest proponents and supporters of BCash! 
Is all of the above coincidence? I'll let you decide... but this community has reached a conclusion on this topic.
Why is BCH silver? Until they keep the vicious social attacks up and running, it's not even silver, it's just a shitcoin.

He was forced to buy... to close his shorts. That's how you "neutralize" your position: A short requires a long, and a long requires a sell to close out. Guys shorted, and the short was closed. So he did not make any money now that the price is higher.
I don't think he lost $10m. That would mean having $10m in margin, cold hard cash sitting on his account, and then opening a position which is for 10,000BTC, say. ($10m only gets you ~1,300BTC...)
Losses in futures markets are always on the DIFFERENCE in price. If you short 10BTC @ $7,500 and close at $7,600, you lose $1,000... that's $100 for each BTC. And you'll need at least $1,000 in margin on your account.

The pictorial is cool, but inaccurate because it doesn't represent the "current" debate. 
The block size debate is over. Bitcoin will scale off chain and 1MB blocks will continue to exist for the foreseeable future.

Same logic applies - Any client from any of these years will sync to the Bitcoin network.


2011 is not an arbitrary choice... I believe there was a hard fork early on, which will not make the clients before the fork sync to ANY network. From that ONE Bitcoin emerged, fully supported by the ENTIRE community. THAT Bitcoin syncs to the Bitcoin network, not the BCash one.
At the end of the day the community decides what is Bitcoin by running the nodes with the rules they want. But I don't expect you to accept that. You'll reply with "Satoshi's Vision!!!", or "The White Paper!!!", or "Electronic CASH!!!".  Yawn.

That's arguing against the point.
This means that we will not compromise until we *have to*. Can we make improvements without sacrificing decentralization? Yes. From LN to optimizing on-chain space (Schnorr, MAST, ...) and sidechains/drivechains. Let's explore these possibilities first, and THEN we can start "making compromises". Not before.
Increasing the block size is the "easy way out". Every monkey can increase the block size, but few realize it's a dead end. True scaling does not lie on-chain, and off-chain scaling is hard. Feel free to contribute, the more brain power is dedicated to it, the sooner we'll be able to scale.

**No, it does not mean there are few exchanges.** Logics 1-0-1 fail. "If you want to ski, you need snow." That's another truism. Does that mean there's not much snow??? 
As for the exchanges supporting BCH, I have no idea what do they represent, and don't particularly care. (Btw, the question is also broken English.) I have my coins off exchange, and once the dust settles, I'll decide what to do. And If I'll have to register with a new exchange to dump BCH, I'll do it. Or maybe I'll keep them.

You are completely off the rockers.
Yes, I hope the day will come when we can handle everything in BTC, too. But to get there, people need to get confidence in the tech first. And with all the flaws CB has, it has done more for BTC than most other companies AND/OR individuals. (I said most, not all.) Why? Because without CB
1. Many people would not be able to buy cryptos
2. Merchants would not dare take payments in cryptos, it's simply too risky.
Think about a merchant accepting BTC two years ago. In a short period of time, they'd have to shut down because BTC was losing value every day! As a merchant, you need to keep your eyes very open on the here and now, not just on the hypotheticals of "in 10yrs time".
So yeah, CB helped the ecosystem A LOT.

@_date: 2019-05-12 17:46:55
No. There's a paper exploring the trilemma of blockchains: Decentralization - Consensus - Scale. You can only have two.
For bitcoin this means decentralization and consensus, but no scale. Important: No **on chain** scale.
So to your question of "on ledger" payments, no it won't be.
But that doesn't mean it cannot be achieved otherwise, like through off chain solutions. Then you'll have scale and decentralization, but not (global) consensus.
@_date: 2019-05-06 12:48:47
There's a lot of hype indeed. Some is justified, some is not. The rabbit hole is deep, very deep, and you should learn about it on your own. I'll point out a few things that are very relevant IMO.
* Wars are always financed by printing money. Gov doesn't have $$ and wants to go to war. Print money. You cannot print bitcoin.
* Over time, all fiat money goes to it's intrinsic value, zero. As you print, and print, and print... the money becomes worthless. Many examples over the world and throughout history. The ones who suffer from this are the people who worked to create the value supporting that fiat. It's a huge theft against the people. This doesn't apply to bitcoin - You earn your bitcoin, no central bank trickery can deflate that value away.
* If you take the proper precautions (store your private keys safely!!), no one can take your money other than savage physical abuse. And even that might prove useless. 
* Nobody can stop you from sending coins to whoever you want. Might not sound like a problem to you, but talk to immigrants or people living in oppressive regimes.
This is just the tip of the iceberg. DYOR, there's a lot to learn.

PIA is owned by Rick Falkvinge, if not mistaken. And Rick Falkvinge is a common bcash scammer.

@_date: 2017-07-17 18:26:17
The overall market behaviour is generally a combination of various factors. For example:
* Fundamentals
* Technicals
* Events
In the specific case of BTC, fundamentals are driving the price up, that's why we're all hodling. Events do play a role, say when Bitfinex got hacked there was a sharp correction, which didn't last long. And finally technicals... these drive a lot of the short term speculation. A lot, not all. But technicals are ONLY about the candlestick movements, which is why they are often dismissed as *tea leaves reading*.
On this occasion, however, the market is telling us that technicals are strongly at play. That's what GS did in their analysis, pure technical analysis, tea leaf reading. Anticipating 8/1 beahviour is impossible short of saying something like "we expect markets could drop if the situation does not get addressed". And IF the market simply bounces back from the GS support level, and never goes below, that means GS' analysis was spot on... which in turn tells you that **the BTCUSD market trades by far and large on technicals**. For now.
Long term fundamentals (to the moon!), short term technicals. Events in this case play a minor role, certainly when the prediction was made 2+ months ahead of time.

Goldman Sachs called the drop. They missed the exact price by a few dollars, which is nothing but understandable in the markets. Let's see what happens now.
One thing. If the price stays essentially above the resistance GS called, then Aug 1st **is completely irrelevant**, the market is ignoring the debate 100%. Why? GS' analysis was a purely technical analysis, and a technical analysis ignores anything but the charts.

There will always be a market for on-chain txs, for various reasons. Like you won't be able to easily transfer very large amounts over LN. Which means people will be paying tx fees, and the fees will keep then miners securing the network.
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:44:40
The whole point of LN and sidechains is to scale off-chain. Maybe these are not perfect technologies to achieve this, but that's the goal. If one could replicate something like "exchanging a paper wallet in person" as technology, you can then only commit one transaction every now and then, and still handle giant transaction volumes.
Maybe we're not there yet technologically, but IMO that's the way to go about scaling, not an overbloated blockchain.

Not a 51% attack if there's ample full node support, i.e. community support. Actually, a 51% attack has got nothing to do with it.
And yes, the minority miners can always fork themselves away, but they'll need to implement some other changes, i.e. a proper hard fork, or have their blocks always orphaned and/or flat out rejected. (Kinda like a miner could assign themselves 25BTC today and the block would get rejected.) Economic incentives provide strong arguments that they won't, though.
Btw, your line of reasoning is why bcahsers claim SegWit was an "attack" on Bitcoin. It's not an attack when there is overwhelming consensus and support from economic users. And there were miners opposing it, that much we know. 
He lost the bet because it was about the possibility of implementing this as a soft fork. *Can* it be done, i.e. is it possible in principle. And the answer is most certainly yes.

In all honesty I don't think the community would be of much help. Everyone can build an interface for automated trading, but not very many can build a successful strategy. Those who do, don't disclose. If I manage to build one, I'm not gonna share the details... Maybe some high level ideas, but no details. If everyone starts using the strategy, it stops being effective.
But yeah, I'm coding in Python and the idea is to build an interface that can accept various strategies to run. So you can build the strategy without worrying about the rest. Will probably open source this at some point.

Too many to list, but the biggest one is they are as hostile to Bitcoin as it gets. Yes, ironic... I know. They hate that without which they would not exist. 
A few examples - They supported NYA/S2X, which was an attempt to "fire Core", the very devs who built the most resilient and robust network out there, with 99.9985+% up-time in the last 10yrs. (But they are stupid and never really understood that "Core" don't control Bitcoin in any sense, so NYA/S2X failed.) In supporting **SegWit** 2X note the presence of **SegWit**. So yeah, they were claiming to want larger blocks, but ALSO **SegWit**. 18 months later, where do we stand? Yep, no frigging sign of SegWit for BitPay. What's more, they rolled out support for bcash, and even promote it over Bitcoin. (Just try to pay with Bitcoin using BitPay... see how bcash is first option, has no "network fees" but Bitcoin does?). Soooo... plenty of time/resources to add support of an abortuscoin, but cannot implement SegWit? And the last major thing was advising their clients that to used SegWit they must "upgrade" their node software to S2X, which was an absolute lie. Many of us have Bitcoin Core and happily use SegWit, that garbage S2X software absolutely not required.
All of the above, and more, is why BitPay is a shit company, openly hostile to Bitcoin. If you want to accept Bitcoin, you should use BTCPayServer, which offers the same interface and a 5min, double-click self install process.
Last thing, if you wonder why BitPay is so hostile to Bitcoin, it helps to know that Roger "Bitcoin-Jesus-fucking-scammer" Ver is one of the main investors in BitPay. And Roger is the scambrain behind bcash. 
Hope that gives you some ideas for why BitPay is a shit company.

You point out some great aspects of hodling. It's easy to shout "JUST HODL!!". It's also easy to say, in hindsight, "You were so lucky, all you had to do was hodl." The truth is it's a lot harder than people imagine. The experience of losing hundreds of thousands of $ in a bear market cannot be described. And the balls to keep hodling are also something beyond description - You either have them, or not. Those who do are probably reckless gamblers at heart. And the reason why not many get rich.

We won't get to 300GB next year, it's more like ~75GB per year with full blocks, which are not really full now. So that's ~33% increase the first year.
The second year the GB increase is the same, but the % increase is lower, more like 25%. And the third year it becomes &lt;20% increase. That's pretty much on line with tech improvements. And the year after, it's slower than tech improvements.
This bear market is doing a lot for scaling and sustainability. Don't think we need a reduction of block size/weight.

That's a different story because we're back to trust. A user cannot, an I understand people are (rightly) suspicious. So your only reliance is on peer review and a history of building reputation. Some VPNs explicitly state they don't use logs, and have so far stood the test of time.

Maybe a bit late, but here's my take... it is largely a matter of perspective, yes. Or, I prefer, of consensus. If you have consensus, which is not 51% majority, then a fork is not an attack. No consensus, and it's absolutely an attack.  
There's also some blurring between 51% and soft fork because a 51% can be launched without changing the consensus rules. Censoring certain txs is not a consensus rule change, but could be accomplished with a 51%. On the other hand, a hostile soft fork with 51% is in serious danger of failing (much like trying to censor txs, if everyone else wants them in) because that's a pretty slim majority. That's why core devs have set the threshold at 95%, to ensure minimal disruption. SegWit could have been activated with much less miner support, though.
Also worth noting is that the "mechanism" to enforce new rules is just longest-PoW-chain. You don't need to do anything else, and the new-consensus-rules chain will dominate. 
Anyway, glad I was able to help a bit. I'm still learning all the time... it's a lot to learn.

What do you mean "If there was any basis"? It's maths! Growth is constant in absolute terms, which means it's decreasing in % terms. Tech progress is an aporox constant % so far.
The bear market is keeping people away, so blocks are not full. Node count is also slowly increasing. And in 3yrs you will get improved tech to verify the full chain much faster.
It would have been the thing to do 5yrs ago, but today there's not much of an argument for smaller blocks, given the current market situation.

How does one value the USD? How does one value the EUR? How does one value [*insert favourite fiatcoin*]?
A different story is to determine whether to invest or not. Intelligent investment is about asymmetrical bets - Lose a little, but win a lot. If you stick to this, even if you lose most of the time, you'll still come out ahead. How does Bitcoin fare from this viewpoint?
Well, Bitcoin might go to zero, or almost. I hope you agree with this. Potential loss, 100% of initial investment, assuming no leverage.
What about gains? I think the sky is the limit. Venezuela, Argentina, Iran, Turkey, Russia, and some other as well, are all struggling with their fiatcoins. They also can't trade internationally because Uncle Sam said so. What if they started to trade with Bitcoin? A few nation states coming flat out and saying they will start all international trades in Bitcoin. Sounds crazy, but is it really? Don't want to start a thread on this, but if you think about it, it's not that crazy... they have a lot to gain, at the cost of giving up control of their (failing) currencies. If this happens, the sky is the limit. The price can go to [*insert favourite prediction*].
Is Bitcoin an asymmetric bet? Absolutely. One of the most asymmetric bets ever, very likely. So to **NOT** invest in bitcoin, you have to be goddamn confident it will go to zero. Like 90%+ convinced it will go to zero. More like 99% convinced it will go to zero. Are you that confident?

That's the exact same religious extremism that wants TB blocks, just the other side of it.
No, smaller is not better. There's a compromise to be made between ease of validation (smaller is better) and ease of transaction (bigger is better). At a rate of one txs per block, this would make the network unusable as it wouldn't be enough to be a "base layer" at all. At 1GB blocks, yeah... PayPal 2.0, but stupidly inefficient.
So we need to pick a compromise, and right now, 1MB works. In 10-20yrs, after a lot of tech has been developed and HW improvements, we'll be in position to raise the block size, if it becomes necessary.

The premise


is broken. Because there will always be demand for on-chain payments, not all coins will be in the LN. LN is a great technology, but it comes with compromises. Like coins being in hot wallets, and hence subject to hacking. These compromises are OK when top notch impenetrable security is not required, like buying coffee. But I can guarantee a bank will not take chances and store most of the coins in cold storage. So moving them will be on-chain. And I'm talking payments large as a mortgage and up. Not on LN.

The real node count that matters is the count of "economic nodes". Nodes that conduct economic transactions. And by economic transactions I don't mean just send/receive, but also validate that each tx is legit. So inevitably full nodes.
Why is this the relevant metric? Because behind an economic node there's a human, or company, using it. A human that can decline to change the node to different rules, like Shit2X.

Very true, actually. Not surprising that a `redditor for 3 months` wouldn't know the history. So let me help you very briefly. Conbase (not a typo...) has supported pretty much every attack on Bitcoin to date. Someone wants to fork the network? Yes baby, Conbase will get right behind them! Their dislike for bitcoin has gone so far that the CEO **cannot even bring himself to say "bitcoin"**. He'll always deflect and say "crypto" instead of bitcoin. (He was even caught deleting a Tweet where he contained bitcoin and then replaced it with crypto.)
So yeah, it's pretty easy to call out Conbase for all their crap.

L-BTC might refer to Liquid-BTC, which is the native token to the Liquid sidechain. It's a sidechain to the Bitcoin chain and L-BTC are pegged 1-1 to Bitcoin, which means it's basically the same. But the peg could be different, in principle, and/or other assests could be issued on Liquid.
LN is another type of off-chain network and doesn't have it's own coin/token but uses the coin of the underlying network, Bitcoin in this case. So in LN you are spending bitcoin, not some other coin. And if you want to use LN, you need to buy bitcoin first.

A soft fork is enforced if the majority of miners support it. This is a necessary condition for a soft fork, which guarantees that out of consensus blocks are eventually rejected. So let's say 70% of miners embrace the soft fork. The remaining miners will mine the 12.5 rules. What happens to a 12.5 BTC block? Legacy nodes accept it, new nodes reject it. The 70% of miners that reject it, will not mine on top of it, so extend the .25BTC chain. Because they are a majority, the .25 chain will eventually become longer even for legacy nodes, who will reorg and start following the .25BTC chain. 
Basically legacy nodes **would** accept 12.5 BTC blocks, but there's none to be found because the majority of miners is enforcing new rules. (In turn this will quickly bring ALL miners to mine the majority consensus rules...)
Note that tour bet had a question if it **CAN** be done, and the answer is yes. For example, it can be done as soon as 70% of miners support it. (Even sooner, actually, but let's ignore.)

That's painful to read. But what you've learned, I hope for you, is to not invest more than you can afford to lose.
Thing to consider right now. You have many shitcoins, most of which will never recover. Check out the top 20 cryptos in 2013 - Only Bitcoin and Litecoin are still around in any meaningful sense. Then ask yourself, why would today's Top 20 still be around in 5yrs? They won't. Except for a few. Bitcoin, of course. Very likely Litecoin because it has some Lindy cred. And I'd venture XMR and SC, but that's just me. (For the record, I have Bitcoin only.)
Why am I saying this? Consider selling all the shitcoins and buying something that will still be around in 5yrs. The bet you are making in this way is that we'll experience another bull run at some point within ~5yrs, but only for coins that will be still around. And crypto bull runs are easily ~100x - Look at bitcoin, went from a low of $200 to $20k. Other coins did the same.
If this bull run materialises, you'll be glad you stuck around. Of course, the bull run might never come, in which case many Bitcoiners will join you in the "I lost it all" club, and we can set up drinking anonymous Meetups where we drink ourselves to unconsciousness every day. At least you won't be alone.

To the contrary, the Scandinavian countries are the perfect example of socialism with democracy. You don't have "free capitalism", instead you have "free enterprise".
The core aspect of socialism is not the state controlled aspect of all the means of production. The latter is just *an attempt* at enacting the fundamental part of socialism, that is capital control. Or perhaps better, control of capital. In this sense it is **not** "you can produce this, and cannot produce that", that's control of production. Control of capital, in essence, means controlling the natural flow of money. What that is? Italians have a simple saying 
"*Money makes money, shit makes shit.*"
In practice, in real life, this manifests itself as "the rich get richer, to poor get poorer". And in America "the middle class is disappearing", the "American dream is dying" and so on. (The American dream is dying because you cannot have equal opportunities if everything is driven by profit alone.) I'm sure you have "*explanations*" for why that is - Central banks, crooked politicians, lobbying businesses, you name it! - but the truth is much more simple, and is hiding in that Italian saying. 
So... if you think the current situation of growing wealth inequality is perfect the way it is, then capitalism will give you exactly that. Conversely, you are, inevitably, a "socialist", because the only way to reverse/change that trend is through control of capital. And it doesn't matter if the control comes in the form of corporate tax, personal tax or some other form of taxation, the key is preventing capital from excessive accumulation. 
In this light, the Scandinavian countries are perfect examples of Socialism with democracy, precisely because of their very high income taxes. You will still have inequality, which is another commonly ill-understood idea re socialism (i.e. we should all be and have the same), but a very healthy one. Healthy for the society - Individuals will not be able to become as ridiculously rich as in America, but the poor will be a million times better of. And no, you cannot have both.
As a last comment. On a planetary level, I am the definitely the hated 1%. Even in America I edge to that. And in NYC on its own, I'm somewhere between 10% and 5%, closer to the latter than the former, and working my ass to get above that. I benefit from all the idiotic policies Trump will put in place, yet I didn't vote for him. Capitalism is padding my pockets pretty well, and at the expense of everyone else, yet I'd change that. Try to make sense of this contradiction.

After 2008 people looked at the housing market in the US and noticed that NYC real estate didn't really do all that badly. In fact, it only dropped 5%-10%, where elsewhere it dropped 60%+. What happened next? NYC real estate exploded as people realized it was a mini safe heaven.

This is pure FUD, but it's a very long story.
* Taming Bitcoin: That's taken out of context, and what it means is reducing the volatility of Bitcoin. Andreas said as much, so if one is manipulating the market, so is the other.
* More paper gold than real gold: Yes, there's **open contracts** for that much gold, but the **absolute majority** of those contracts settles without ever touching gold. Speculators see they made money and want to cash in. Or they lost money and want to limit losses. So they close the contract. Real gold unaffected.
Futures are just a way to buy/sell something, though not today but in the future. They impact the price just as buying the real thing. But that means both ways, up AND down. These articles are written by people who have no idea about markets and how it all functions, and the result is pure FUD, or worse. Avoid.

Jordan Peterson and others are also feeling the pain of the current political environment, just for disagreeing!

Rule number 1, only invest what you're happy to lose. Any more than that and you'll make panic decisions and sell at the worst possible time.
Rule number 2, see rule number 1.
Now that we've got the two most important rules out of the way, let's talk the rest. Find an "on-ramp" and buy bitcoin. That is, find your favorite exchange that will allow you to buy bitcoin. In the UK, I think Bitstamp and Coinbase are available. Possibly Kraken? Not too sure. Then you'll need to do the KYC/AML part, which could take some time, so start doing it asap.
Valid alternatives, and actually recommend, I think Hodl Hodl and Bisq are decentralized exchanges, and liquidity is improving all the time. Big benefits are no AML/KYC and more anonymous. Drawbacks, price may be slightly worse, and you probably need to understand better what's going on to send/receive coins.
As you are thinking how to get your coins, invest ~$100 to get a *hardware wallet*. I recommend Trezor, but people speak positively of Ledger as well, up to you. Oh, almost forgot Cold Wallet. Very solid choice, though I think currently slightly less common. But very solid HW wallet, very possibly the best. 
Why do you need a hardware wallet?
Rule number 3: Not your keys, not your bitcoin.
It will take some time to fully sink in, but the short of it is that a hardware wallet allows you peace of mind. You'll have full control of your coins, and no one could hack them away from you. (Read on the importance of storing the 12/24 word seed appropriately.) If coins are on an exchange, and the exchange gets hacked, your coins might be gone, see recent Binance hack.
If you use Bitstamp + Trezor, sending coins to your Trezor is as user friendly as it gets since they built a seamless interface. (Might be true for Ledger as well...) You just plug in the Trezor and Bitstamp will detect the address to send to automatically. No copy paste, no mistakes in the address.
Once you withdraw, sleep well, your investment is secure from prying eyes. And then, whenever you've got some extra £££, buy a little bitcoin and repeat. Don't worry about price, you will be pound cost averaging, which is the best strategy for non traders. 
And if you wanna trade? Dedicate 10% of tour bitcoin investment to trading, not more. So even if you lose it all, you only lost 10% of what you were already happy to lose, but the remaining 90% is still safe. And if you are good at it, then it's up to you. But by then you won't be seeking advice on Reddit...
Good luck buddy and welcome to the show!

Not saying that's not true, but I am saying that your average investor has no idea about what rolling an options or futures even is. And maybe today you can just automatically roll, but I'm not sure you could have done that in 2009. So there's the risk of forgetting about the trade... Not to mention the roll costs you money.

This is no flaw of BTC at all, but it's the biggest misconception by various nocoiner bitcoin bears like Peter Schiff and Nuriel Roubini.
Yes, you can clone the code, change a few parameters, and produce a coin. No, that coin is *not* bitcoin and does not touch it. You cannot clone the network effects bitcoin has. The huge community of (mostly unknown) devs building stuff on top of it. The Wall St players starting to build on it, hate them as much as you will. And so on.
That's what makes bitcoin's real strength, the community. And you cannot clone that. (I didn't say it can never be overtaken, but if it does happen then the bitcoin experiment will indeed die. Luckily, with every day that passes this is less likely, as the current crypto meltdown is showing.)
