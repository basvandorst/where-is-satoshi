I guess uncle warren got a bit old and out of date

That I know , but was it a coincidence that the price pumped during that? And was a coincidence that it dumped later on , close to sec declining these ridiculous proposals

Greater fool , just like bill gates said

Nice for you , love Nederlands for their open approach to tech ... been there on exchange and learned some shit about sustainable building and smart cities before I ever got into crypto and I think of it as of life changing experience now, especially after I heard about IOTA . However I still think that Asia is 2 steps ahead in blokchain and crypto adoption , and I think people here don’t even realise how far behind we are

Eastern Europe...how bout u ?

I lost a 30 dollar bet ! Whatamagonnadooo?!??!?!

I think it’s high time for some “NANO accepted here” signs 
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:53:44
I agree but it’s easier said when you have indeed invested one year ago, compared to hundreds that bought in at the ATH. Not a problem 4 me tho since I have my btcs for an average of 8k, and I consider it a gr8 price in a long run 
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:54:37
I don’t , but I’m looking forward to it when my 3rd world country catches up with the adoption 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:28:07
I think the bitcoin domination will rise for some more time, acumulating new money from the outside, and at some point is going to trigger a massive alt bullrun when that freshly acummulated money gets transfered and traded with. Just my personal opinion though
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:49:21
Looks gr8!

Last week I was ordering a meal in my Eastern European third world country via one of these sites that let you choose different restaurants etc and they had a bitcoin payment option.. Was really surprised by this. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:11:07
Well to me it looks like we have quite important evening in front of us... Either we resist and bounce of 8k sup, or we go down forming a bear flag, probably hitting 6k in next few days... God, I need to hurry my boss up to pay me for the last month... :D
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:23:42
I dunno, how about now? :P

@_date: 2018-03-17 14:18:41
It's all connected to previous price action, and psychology of the masses. People tend to see full round numbers as more important, so they treat them as ones
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:37:13
eee... black gultch? Blighttown?
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:33:47
8k bitcoin be like:
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:02:58
Yeah it should go really low so everyone can buy at a discount relox dudes
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:21:29
Yeps, and the money comes always when it's least needed/after dip.
And the transaction time with regular banking just kills me, You want to have some money to trade with for the weekend? Well it always comes on monday :/. Maybe it's because of my stupid eastern european 3rd world country..? No idea
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:19:09
Hope this will be an exciting weekend, and that bears won't eat us alive... Should be an interesting struggle, even if we go below 8k
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:45:13
Let's spread some more FUD and make it a triple bottom instead of double
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:45:41
How about now:
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:34:51
I don't see it comming soon... I mean, the dynamics of this market are linked, and rely on things such as Market Cap, total volume and Bitcoin dominance. We would need a series of events happening, lesser BTC dominance, and much much more for this market to become really stable and reliable. For now it's just to easy to manipulate (1000 ppl having over half of all the bitcoin in circulation), it's more educated gambling than it is serious investing..
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:44:20
Watch this.. bullish MACD 1H chart
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:59:26
I guess that's what happens when half of the circulating currency is in hands of a thousand people... Hey, it sounds just like USA!
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:34:46
Can you explain how would they do that? I'm really curious 
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:41:40
What do you think?
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:46:45
Well, tether is a great idea fundamentally, that provides an unique opportunity that lets you earn even when the most dominant coins lose value. I see no problem in here, the problem is the actual USD backing of the coins. If I have been here in December, would be glad to invest in USDT, ride it until BTC hits 6k, tripling my funds, and then doubling it to 12k... Then all u have to do is repeat 
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:12:50
Well there's still a nice bunch of people that are interested in it..
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:05:53
Mainly because it involves fiat, and there are just much less fiat exchanges than USDT exchanges (i.e. Binance), and additionally it enables you to skip the btc exchange step in many cases if you have your money invested in some alts. Look dude, I'm not saying USDT is some sort of miracle, and for sure I'm not saying it is safe (as it won't be until we get some legitimate proof of the backing), just that the idea is convenient. Same goes for these alts that will be backed with gold I believe

Why downvote, I've never said anything about lambos and moons :/, just wanted to give TA update
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:04:34
I guess this selloff was much needed tho, so that it doesn't happen later.
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:45:19
I know that pain ... did it too with a long some time ago, when I thought I saw a reversal that was ofc in fact a bull trap. A nice protip is that you can actually move your stop loss with the price so it can become somewhat like a negative take profit ( of course if the price goes in the right direction at least a little bit ) good luck Next time ;), and be careful with the leverage, and always check btcshorts and btclongs on TradingView 
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:39:50
Didn’t you have a stop loss ? I’m always curious.. if you can save at least 10% it’s still worth it 
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:16:28
Sad but true 
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:15:26
It’s time to go loooooong now
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:32:17
Im really into the latter idea of burning BCH... Preferably all of it ��
