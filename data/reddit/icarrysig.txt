Wondering what it costs to buy one and set it somewhere...  Hmm...
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:58:07
But that doesn't happen.
I've made some nice easy money playing short term waves on GBTC.
When the market turns, there will assuredly be a dip on GBTC when folks panic sell.
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:37:21
Yes.  Saving is bad for the economy.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:29:20
No.  You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin.  It's still early.  Put in what you can afford to invest and get on the bus.  Worry more about % gains on your investment and less about the actual units if crypto currency that your investment can buy.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:25:32
That isn't shady at all.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:26:30
I'm just being snarky about all the ney-sayers that keep saying it's a ponzi scheme, it's going to crash, don't bother, it's a fad.... 
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:04:42
1) Do your own research.
2) You will hear from people that it is a scam or that it is the future.  Take their opinion with a grain of salt if they can't articulate how blockchain actually works.
3) Tell them to invest what they can afford, and only what they can afford to lose.
4) It WILL go down.  It WILL go up.  Don't get twitcy.  Staring at the charts right away is a great way to panic and make bad choices.
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:58:42
Paper wallet.  For sure!
Then teach her parents about keys and why keep that paper is important.
Also, keep a copy in your files.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:03:56
Perfect.  I've put it on my calendar!
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:51:24
Trading according to a specific plan supported by a clear strategy and data are much better than twitchy emotional trades.  Since most of us can't do the first for shit, the second is preferable and yields better results.
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:43:15
They will subtract a fee.  The fee will be listed on the confirmation screen before you send any funds.

Why does it matter if it drops tomorrow and climbs the next day?  Don't panic sell, and you will be fine.
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:30:27
You are just ahead of your time.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:21:25
That isn't how it works.
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:28:40
You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin.  Just put in what you can afford.  Then stop looking at the price for a while.  If you keep watching, every little dip is going to make you want to sell.  Just let it ride.

Hi.  Welcome to reddit.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:41:37
Someone decided to pay off their house.  Or yacht.
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:27:09
Came here to say this.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:19:21
Yes and no.
Yes, it can and does today.  You can spend bitcoin if you can find crypto savvy merchants and you can accept Bitcoin if you can find crypto savvy customers.  The number of each is relatively low at the moment.  The network can support the load as far as todays transaction volumes go.
When Bitcoin actually goes mainstream, transaction volumes will go beyond what Bitcoin can scale to as it stands today.  Some of the recent (controversial changes) have been aimed at increasing capacity.  There will be more changes in the future as things pick up.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:02:57
Make sure you back up your keys still no matter which route you go.
Even with hardware wallets.  I've seen too much hardware fail in my IT career to trust any piece of gear to always just work.  Especially 10+ years down the road.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:49:37
Just get on the boat.  You don't have to buy in wholr units.  Put in what you can and focus on %, not the total number of units.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:49:05
Yes.  The question is how big will it be.  Could be $500, could be $2500. Who knows!
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:38:27
Please don't died again, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:55:15
BTC frenzy.
Will see them perk up again once BTC price increases slow down slightly.
Remember, a coin at ~$50 like XMR only has to go up a few bucks to achieve the same % increase we see in BTC with $100+ dollar increases.  Folks will remember that soon.
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:55:09
You only realize the loss if you sell.
Corrections are great opportunities to buy more!
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:37:37
But I feel like a chump doing it.
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:37:05
It trades at a premium, but if there is a big correction, it will crash at a premium too.

@_date: 2017-08-27 19:26:18
I'm sure the government will say gains are realized when selling from one coin to another while still staying in the crypto space.  Conversion back to dollars probably isn't the trigger.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:28:31
I do totally agree with you though, that folks should not confuse investments with savings, and that investing more than you can afford to lose is a bad idea.
I'm invested to the point where it would hurt and I'd be really pissed at myself if I lost it all, but it wouldn't break me.
I fully believe this shit is the future and I've put every penny I can justify into it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:23:26

Make sure you keep track of your gains and make sure you retain enough to cover your tax liability.  Report the gains as invest earnings on your tax return.
Don't worry about the IRS assuming you are a drug dealer.  Bitcoin is a big deal and they are well aware that people are investing in them.  The big institutional investors are only getting started with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:36:44
$100 x 0.00498859 = $0.50
Edit:. With Bitcoin prices around $4500, a $100 increase is only about 2.2%.

Ernie Cline, is that you?
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:05:25
An exaggeration to make a point.
Nearly any other source of funding will be at a lower interest rate the expected rate of return on Bitcoin over the next few years.
What do you expect Bitcoin to  be worth a year from now?
To keep the math simple, let's say she borrows $4000 at 10% with the full amount due one year from now (no monthly payments).  Next year on this date, she will pay back $4400.  Correct?
If you expect that Bitcoin to be worth more than $4400 next year at this time, you will be better off keeping the appreciating asset (Bitcoin) and borrowing the dollars to fund the business.
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:05:27
Is there a list of these denominations somewhere that I can look at?
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:31:59
If you find a Bitcoin ATM somewhere, be very suspicious.  Even if legit, fees will probably bend you over.
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:01:22
Serious question...
If you increase block size to be able to handle more transactions, wouldn't total storage space required be less for larger blocks vs. smaller blocks for the same number of total transactions?  Non transaction overhead of  multiple smaller blocks would be eliminated by using fewer larger blocks, right?
What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:07:55
Find an individual and buy directly from them.  Probably your best bet.

I doubt it will on a large scale.  Most folks don't have the financial literacy to manage significant sums of money.  Like those that win the lottery, they are rich for a short time and then end up broke.  Few manage the wealth successfully and stay wealthy.

@_date: 2017-11-05 20:38:50
Buying the coins isn't the problem.  That part is easy.  It's the fact that that money is in retirement accounts and penalties will be charged if they cash it out instead of buying an investment within the account or rolling it over to another retirement account of some sort.  It is possible to work around this (self directed IRA, etc...) but those hoops are a pain to jump through for most folks.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:18:56
Different everyones.

@_date: 2017-11-05 16:15:33
The snag my dad is running into is that his investment capital is tied up in retirement accounts with pre-tax money.  That is making it difficult for him to invest in crypto since options are few at this time.  Even a few more months and that will probably be a non-issue.

@_date: 2017-11-05 15:20:23
It depends on their financial and life stage situation.  If your parents are retired or very close to retirement, their financial strategy is probably to be moving to less risky investments to set them up for drawing an income from their savings.  Bitcoin is pretty risky, and not the right investment for everyone at every stage of life.
My dad's financial planner told my dad the same thing.  Not because he thinks Bitcoin is bad or a scam but because of what their strategy needs to be right now with respect to risk.
I don't think my dad is going to listen though.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:14:17
I usually can't stand listening to reporters doing stories about things I know about.  Is it worth listening to, or will it drive me nuts?

I don't own any, but I'm thinking of buying a few thousand dollars worth and letting it ride for a few years.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:00:18
Stocks are not too risky.  Stocks are a primary investment for nearly every retirement plan.
Bitcoin is not a stock.
Bitcoin won't go to zero because they "run out".  The limited supply will actually drive price up.  The world will simply use smaller fractions of bitcoin's for commerce/trade.
Your dad may think he has your best interests in mind, but his position is based on false statements all around.
Cryptocurrency is the future of money.  Bitcoin may be eclipsed by another coin at some point, but for the foreseeable future, it is the primary cryptocurrency and will be the first to go mainstream.

The coin balace is stored in the block chain.  Your keys are all you actually have.  Those keys are necessary to access a particular address.

At a minimum, set up and use the coinbase BTC vault.
Better is to move your coins off coinbase and into a wallet.  Make sure you back up your keys.  No keys, no coins.

@_date: 2017-09-10 14:44:08

@_date: 2017-09-04 23:24:32
Is that not the entire point of making investments?
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:47:52
Seems legit.
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:55:22
 Only if someone is willing to pay it.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:58:54
It is always the worst time ever right after you buy.
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:30:36
Of course.  In a private transaction, they can ask whatever they want.  You can pay what you are willing.  That's pretty much how it works.  It's useful to establish an agreed upon price (or at least how a current price will be  determined) ahead of time so you aren't both wasting your time though.
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:02:15
Because bitcoin is very volitile in the short term.
If you calculate the expected return taking into account statistical probably of up vs. down by some amount in a 24 hour period, I expect you would be break even.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:05:14
Yes, investing for the long term.  That said, I will still reevaluate my holdings over that time.
10 years is an eternity in technology.
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:40:57
I gotta think on that some more.  Will post back tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:53:04
If nothing else, set up the multi-key "vault" on coinbase.
Best is to take them off coinbase and put them in a wallet (hardware or software).  Make damn sure you back up your keys.  Your coins aren't actually in the wallet, the keys are.  They are what allow you to access the coins at a particular Bitcoin address.
If you plan to trade, send them to an exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:21:26
I'm already as heavily invested as I feel like I can afford to be.  (The whole don't invest more than you can afford to lose thing).

@_date: 2017-09-01 00:56:31
So, no explanation of what you are doing?
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:29:45
Possibly consider putting deposits in on a monthly basis to help reduce fees.
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:41:02
Hardware fails.  Ask any IT support person.  If you use a hardware wallet, you better back up your keys.  So, my answer.... Both.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:32:06
I don't want to "recommend" any specifically.  To help limit research effort, I'd say read up on the top 10.  Understand the problem they are solving or the key value to coin/platform.

We are still very early in the crypto game.  It hasn't even gone mainstream yet.  Volume is almost all crypto trading and not actual commerce yet.  Developers are still working through performance issues.  Hardly any merchants even know what crypto currency is, let alone accept it.  There is a relatively small supply of coins, and will only ever be a few million more than exist today.  It is a game changer for social and international commerce.  Pretty sure it's going to keep going up in the long term.
It's like owning a car when there aren't any roads yet.  Definitely a bumpy ride, but it will smooth out eventually.
Besides, where we're going, we don't need roads.

I hope you have your keys backed up somewhere else too.
@_date: 2017-09-10 13:52:23
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:58:27
Yes.  Why would you have bought in at any price if you didn't believe that it was going to increase in value?
Crypto is volitile.  It's a bumpy road.  Log off and let it sit.  Don't stare at the charts and tickers for a while.  By the end of the year, the ups and downs will be above your entry point and less of a concern.

Coinbase is one of the easiest to get started on.  Some other exchanges also let you buy coins for USD, like GDAX.  Not all though.  Poloniex is one that doesn't go to/from fiat currency.
Once you buy, you can send your coins to any other exchange to trade.
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:20:07
I'm expecting crypto to become much less volitile in general with volume as it continues to go mainstream, which will accelerate the adoption, adding additional stability.
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:36:25
Buy low, sell high.  If you can.
If not, dump, then pump.

@_date: 2017-09-02 16:09:32
My opinion...
New all time high last night at just a gnats hair shy of $5k.  Folks that have been in for a while decided to sell off and take some profits.  New folks that are buying in saw the drop and started to panic.  Sold off, which dropped the price more.  Rinse and repeat.
It's a pretty normal correction cycle.
Edit:. Now is a time to "buy the dip" as they say.
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:51:16
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:54:45
Sit tight for the pull back and buy the dip.

Before you put any money, let alone "a lot" of money into crypto currency, do some research and make sure you understand what it is, how blockchain works, and why it is such an important world changing thing.
If you don't believe in the impact if all this.... Then it isnt the right investment for you.

I think the paper should focus on blockchain technology and it's global impact across industries.  Tie that to crypto currency in general, and how the concepts of decentralized electronic currency will change the world.  Then focus on a few specific coins that serve different purposes, BTC as a currency, XMR as a privacy focused currency, ETH as a computing platform, and maybe something like IOTA or another as a specific problem solver.

I think crypto currency is a technology, much like the internet itself.  We are seeing the early stages of that kind if adoption curve.
If you look at adoption of new tech, telephone, automobile, radio, Internet... Each saw much faster adoption than the previous ones.
This isn't a bubble.  It's a continuation of a pattern that has been shown before for mass adoption of new technology.

If I didn't sell, and simply moved coins from one wallet to another that both belong to me, I'd fight like hell.  If you did not sell, there isn't a gain.
Now... If you traded along the way, you will certainly owe taxes on any gains realized by any of those trades.  Any losses realized will offset those gains.  You do owe taxes on those profits.  You should report the earnings accordingly.
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:35:38

I recently came across cointracking.info to help with this.  Free to sign up.  I exported my trade data to a .CSV file from Poloniex and imported into the cointracking site.  It was able to calculate my gains from the trade info.  Pretty slick.  Will make tax time soooo much easier.
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:26:33
This could be useful if the blockchain is being used to store data other than account balances.  If that data needs updating for whatever reason, the blockchain can still provide a secure and auditable trail of data.  I could see it working like the "track changes" feature in Microsoft Word or a revision control system.  All prior states are maintained and visible, yet the system can also easily present the current state of that data as well.
Note:. This is just my initial thought.  I haven't read the article yet.

Better ban dollars too, by that logic.
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:44:33
Nobody can answer that without knowing quite a bit about your personal financial situation.  Only invest what you can afford to lose.  Crypto is volatile, and if you invest money that you need in the short term, it could put you in  bind.  Invest in what you believe in.  If you don't know if you believe in crypto, keep researching the technology, it's applications, and global economic impact.
Investing $300/mo is a lot better than investing nothing, that's for sure!

There was a post recently that linked to a breakdown of percentage of bitcoin addresses with various amounts in them.  A very small proportion of addresses have more than one coin.  Sure, someone could have many coins across many address, but I think you severely overestimate the number of people with hundreds of coins, or even tens of coins.
Invest what you can afford when you can afford it.  Don't worry so much about the fractional units.  Focus on the long term gain percentage.  Also, don't buy and then stare at the charts.  It fluctuates a lot in the short term.  Staring at the charts just encourages you to panic.

You are required to report your gains.  There is a line item for it on your tax return.  You can gamble and hope you are too small time for an audit and don't get caught.  Not really what I would recommend thought.
The answer to the question that you asked is yes, you are taxed.
The question you are really asking is can you evade taxes by buying on one exchange and selling on another.

Because most Craigslist transactions aren't conducted in cash, which isn't anonymous, nor irreversible.  Right?
There are horror stories for everything.  It isn't really that  bad.  I've bought and sold a lot if things on Craigslist.  I've bought landscaping labor, motorcycle parts, tools, and electronics, among other things.  I've sold housewares, furniture, cars, electronics, motorcycle parts, and more.  Never had a problem.  My only gripe is that Craigslist buyers are flakey.  People randomly stop replying or don't show up and then give excuses as to why.
The next items I put on Craigslist will be listed in dollars, but the add will state that I offer a 10% discount if paid in crypto (BTC or XMR preferred).

I can't say that I disagree that when bitcoin does end, it will end badly.  That is likely still quite a ways off.  Why will it end?  Probably because another coin supplanted it.  If that happens too fast, those that aren't paying attention will get burned.  Big time.

We are in the phase where there were cars but not really any roads.  They were still a novelty at that point.
People do use bitcoin.  The problem is that there aren't many merchants that take it yet.  The tech won't quite keep up yet if we had a huge surge in actual usage anyway, so we need the "cars" to get better and we need "roads".
We are still really early on, and it is only going to go faster when this stuff goes mainstream.
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:53:54
The government will get taxes the same way they do with other currency.  Investors report gains on their taxes.  Legitimate business collect sales tax and remit it the same way they do now.  Only catch is that in both cases, the government only accepts certain currency, so there must be a conversion first.

There will always be some variation in price between exchanges, as they are independent from one another, but the difference is usually minimal.  If the difference gets too large, traders pick up on that and buy on the cheaper one to sell on the more expensive one.
Yes, coinbase works great.  They charge fees for that convenience.  It takes some time to get verified if you want to move larger amounts of money in/out.
Also, if you are placing an order for BTC and funding it through a bank transfer, it takes almost a week to go through.  Price is the price from when you execute the order.  Good if prices are going up.  Painful if prices start going down and you can't do anything about it for a week.
Last thing... This stuff is crazy volitile.  Don't freak when prices go down.  Too many people buy and then panic sell.  "What if it never comes back up?". Well, if you are worried about that, then why would you invest in the first place?  Stay calm and trade according to a strategy, not emotion.

Would you be OK with that $40k turning into $10k for a period of time in the next year or two before it goes to the moon by 2025?
The key is not investing money that you can't afford to lose.  You are at a point where you will need that cash available in the relatively near future.  Bitcoin's price is very volitile.  Don't let that impact your ability to go to school.
I would suggest only investing part of that money in crypto if you are dead set on it.
Nobody here knows your financial situation, so we can't tell you an appropriate percent.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:21:50
That makes more sense.  I see that now as I reread the post.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:03:05
You don't need a website to do that calculation.  You can get a rough price on any particular date from the chats on any exchange.
$100 ÷ price from that day = number of coins purchased.
Number of coins purchased * price of a coin today = today's value.

Paper wallet in a birthday card or whatever.  It's physical and they can see/touch it.  That's good for kids.
Then make a couple copies and keep them locked up.

Sometimes.  I don't see much benefit to looking at the prices constantly.  It isn't like I'm going to sell anyway.

I was wondering that, actually.  I'd put up a node if it was PoS. Not going to invest in the hardware and power/cooling to mine PoW.  Nowhere close to worth it.

Should it be "code" or "math"?
After 20+ years in IT, I don't have much faith in code.

His bank is too small to have a routing and account number?

You use crypto as... a currency.  Stores will probably start accepting it in the scenario you describe because they're banking will be halted too.

Well... There is a lot of truth in the idea that the best way to get rich is to live like you are not.

Why not just look at any of the dozens of threads asking this exact same question over the course of the past week alone.

Unfortunately, ignorance of the law is not going to win in court.

Probably because libertarians tend to be more socially liberal.

I misunderstood your post.  Only taxed when sold for a gain.  Not when purchased.  You should be just fine.
Since bitcoin is digital, you aren't traveling with the money, so no need to declare.
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:34:03
I don't think we will any time soon, either.

Regular money is made out of nothing as well.  If you take time to learn about how the legacy financial system actually works, you will quickly realize that money as you know it is a total scam.

LOL, glad I'm not the only one who hated my decision to buy Stratis.  I bled out a couple Grand on that one before I cut and ran.

You will have 1 Bitcoin, 1 Bitcoin2X and one Bitcoin Gold.  Which one will be dominant, and what the symbols/names for each are still up in the air.

I don't disagree.  But I think the bulk of the folks that the dealer in question is targeting are simply ignorant, rather than paranoid.  The population of ignorant people is significantly larger than the population of paranoid people.

Crap.  I got way more than 10% of my assets tied up in my house.  I guess I better diversify.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:21:05
It isn't tough.  The average guy doesn't have to buy in full coin increments.  The guy with half a bitcoin makes the same percentage gain as the guy with 100 bitcoins.

They could watch the address and catch you if they see the coins move out of it.

It was a joke.  I've not used paper wallets before, so I'm only able to make stupid comments.
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:56:36
It isn't.  Yet.  This technology is still developing.  I am confident these problems will be solved.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:51:37
That is probably a good decision for him.

Not as much as self driving vehicles will.
Edit: I do realize you are talking about life insurance, which is basically an investment.  The insurance companies can change out the investments that back the policies to ones that include crypto and evolve with the economy.  I don't see a huge disruption here.  The auto side of things is going to be a big hit for insurance companies though when self driving cars have virtually no accident.

What, like, black and white?

We better next working on reducing the energy required to maintain and secure the blockchain then, too.

Dang, now they have to fire the whole company!
