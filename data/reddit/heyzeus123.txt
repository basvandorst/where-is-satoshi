**Electron Cash worked for me.** My Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is now available to me at a new wallet.  You just have to be VERY CAREFUL to follow the instructions:
Users who want to run the Electron Cash binaries should do
it on a **separate machine, that does not have their Bitcoin wallet**. We
recommend to proceed as follows:
 1. Install Electron Cash on a machine that does not have your
 Electrum wallets.
 2. Wait until the BCC hard fork has taken place, and a few BCC blocks
 have been mined.
 3. Move all your Electrum funds to a new Electrum wallet. This will
 move only your BTC, and not your BCC, because the BCC blockchain has
 replay protection. **Wait until the transaction is confirmed.**
 4. Enter the seed of your (now empty) old wallet or private keys in
 Electron Cash. Since the BTC have been moved to a new wallet,
 entering your old seed in Electron Cash will not put your BTC funds
 at risk.
Following these 4 easy steps you will be able to access your BCC
without compromising your BTC.

**IMPORTANT:** Electron Cash has a "peer list poisoning" bug, see 
To fix, disable auto-connect, and select a server that you trust to be a BCC server, e.g. on Network &gt; Server &gt; right-click on electroncash.casharia.com and select "Use as server".

Awesome, I just withdrew BTC from Kraken (March 1) and got the reduced 0.0005 BTC fee (about $5.50).  Still HIGH compared to GDAX ZERO fee!  So next time I will probably consider doing ALL my BTC trading at GDAX.

Does today's drop in Bitcoin (BTC) have anything to do with the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork tomorrow (Nov 15)?  Coincidence?  I think not.  I still remember the war of mempools when Bitcoin Cash was initially forked.  Thoughts?
