UK General election in two weeks time today.  Might be a serious pump if UK city types, - Think the most liquid money markets in the world, start to hedge against a labour victory by moving their assets out of UK taxation, and confiscation possibilities...  London’s the largest financial market in the world. If people start hiding and moving from GBP into BTC, and other UK assets into GBP, the next two weeks could easily top the last all time high. Might well be wrong mind and nowt will happen. Polls are showing a tightening, for those USA based. We have a left wing party with a ‘literal’ communist wanting to win.

Yes. He doesn’t really accept free market principles. It’s not BT but openreach he wants to nationalise numerous UK broadband companies have their own equipment these days, he supports ?Russia, doesn’t believe in NATO, supports Cuba  and looked to South America countries like Ven for principals.

Odd. Wirex is a fantastic method of buying Bitcoins in the  UK. Not mentioned. Also Coinbase works fine in the UK as well.

The terminology of channels and on / off chain need to be removed for wide adoption. All people want to do is send and receive cash. Try banking terminology instead. "Accept new payment from..." rather than opening channel... this somehow needs to be hidden. The some sort of background batch update process needs to be initiated back to the blockchain as well, for example a default weekly or nightly update.
