Whats the alternative when only using android?
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:32:43
Im aware of that. I thought they had announced that it was being honored is why im asking.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:44:29
Ok thanks!

Honestly im tired of blowing what little money i have. This has fascinated me and caused me to save what i would have blown. Not to mention some company isnt holding it for me and controlling what i do with it.

If i did that i would say use the words and forget the specials. I could see adding those to throw people off.

Nice, i looked into jaxx because of the multiple currency support. Saw alot of bad reviews but maybe it was just people not knowing what they were doing?

I wasnt here for the fork, but when i opened the app it showed a balance in BCH now it doesnt show. Weird stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:30:28
Then why did coinbase say they support it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:34:18
Bought at 13,900 on coinbase.....fingers crossed!
EDIT: coin base decided it would be 14,300. Figures..

Swarm city may if it takes off.

Ive actually rearranged my spending to put a set amount into crypto every week. If im gonna lose it i might as well risk making a buck out of it too.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:50:55
Out of curiosity what wallet are you using?
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:42:43
Recently made my first purchase over the kast week. The first one i made took a few hours to show. The last two were instant.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:38:23
How much you wanna pay for man boobs? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:06:09
Will do. Anything specific i need to learn about it?
Edit: Never mind only took 3 minutes to see the issue. Any suggestions on an android based wallet right now?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:45:26
Name checks out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:39:08
Definitely going to go another direction, but for now im stuck on android without a pc. I know its 2017 but im still in 98.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:51:28
Ah, guess i should've included that info. My bad. Coinbase app with a visa debit card. Im fairly new and i believe the initial latency could have been due to the dip i saw in the markets last week but i just assumed it was alot buying that was holding it up.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:16:45
Right there with you. Saved more these 2 weeks of investing than i have in a year.  Same age and i suck at managing money but usually i dont have any to manage. Lol

The blue at the top makes me want to say coinami. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:50:30
Sorry doesnt show on android for me. I will check it out though.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:50:51
Very appreciated. Thank you.
