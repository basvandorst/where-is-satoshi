yeah- i'd do two things - reach out and see what's up with it taking so long. Mine took much less than that. As for exchanges - are you looking for one that deals in Fiat? If so - bite the bullet and get on Coinbase - buy into whatever - then use GDAX to transfer to someone like bitrex, binance, kucoin, etc. There seems to be as many exchanges as there are currencies

maybe. But when voting with your dollar is the only thing you can do these days, at least a mass exodus would send a message, however small it might be.

was just preparing all the people who weren't loving Coinbase's actions yesterday that going to Gemini, while possibly a better exchange, wasn't going to be a quick setup.
but glad you felt the need to chime in
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:04:27
mine took just about 2 days

it's more the way the bch intro was handled and timing of it all

I sent .00194706 BTC to a friend (middle output) via Electrum's send feature. I used dynamic fees and moved the slider all the way to the left (lower fees/more time).
In the preview, it said it would cost [about .0008 in fees]( 
WHY in the world, after I hit sign and sent it, did I end up paying $30 in fees?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:45:09
[essentially this](
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:53:34
that's strange. The number was pasted in entirety from Electrum's Transaction ID field.
This transfer was all sorts of weird.

Funny that even in a small community inside a small community, there will still be "us/them" mentality.
There's clearly a group of redditors that were using CB as their primary exchange. After yesterday, many of them, including me, are looking for another exchange in order to vote with our dollars. 
Feel free to explain how my post as a fyi to others like me could be interpreted as "hey everyone, did you know that the dedicated hardcore BTC hodlers" use Coinbase? I mean.. for fuck's sake. Crawl off you soapbox and try to make r/bitcoin a little better instead of using it as an opportunity to be a /s dick.

do you not have any online accounts with a bank?

When I've "sent" btc from Coinbase to Electrum, I pay a fee. I guess I missed the free way to do it. Any chance you care to tell me how to go from CB - &gt; Electrum for free?
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:41:28
cool. thanks for following up. I was worried I was completely overlooking something obvious.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:24:16
I can't seem to find how to change the account to a 3-key on CB. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:11:41
and... no. 
I clicked deposit &gt; coinbase account.
My account was selected but the amount box was just ".00". Underneath it on the BTC address tab, it said minimum is .01 and anthing smaller will stay in CB. I figured it was that's why the .00 was auto set in the amount window (since my BTC is .xxxxxxx) I'm an idiot.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:39:30
yeah, i saw the .00 and figured it was the same as buy/sell. The thing I was doing wrong was being a dumbass.
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:07:55
what about Friendster? They were before Myspace.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:26:51
I keep getting this error. Every now and then, I'll get it to load but that get the red popup that says "something went wrong."
Seems like a bad time for CB to go down.
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:35:16
I did. I think it took less than a week.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:59:28
but doesn't that mostly defeat the purpose of what bitcoin was supposed to do? Remove the power from centralized banks and governments and give it to the people? 
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:16:27
bit of a n00b here. How do I use "send a transaction" to move tiny amount of btc from bitaddress wallet into Electrum?
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:42:24
thanks, i'll do this. THanks for taking the time!
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:04:46
right. No, i was more just installing while learning.
I've got like $10 in btc in a bitadress wallet. I'm about to purchase $$ more btc and wanted to nail down the best process and place to keep.
I'm using coinbase to purchase and then wanted a better place to keep them. Enter the reason i want to bitaddress in the first place.
So now i've get Electrum and just wanted to confirm the process to get the btc from bitaddress wallet into Electrum. Shut down computer, came home, power up... now sitting here wondering how in the world is Bitcoin going to be the future when I can't even find a program I installed 30 minutes ago. ha.. man i feel old. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:46:53
and.. i think i should have done more reading before getting into using the software. I brought my computer home from work and now can't even find the software. I can find the wallet but it just asks "what program do you want to open it?"
nothing like feeling like an absolute n00000.....

@_date: 2017-10-19 20:45:29
1 - yes
2 - i downloaded to C drive (i have such a small amount of btc that I'm not too worried)
3- 2.9.3
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:19:29
this was a huge help so thanks again for spending the time to help out.
I "swept" using the 5-key but it's not giving me the "no inputs found."
Based on some searching, it looks like the btc amount is too small?
i guess if it's not one thing, it's another
