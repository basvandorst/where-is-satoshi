Made a public bet on r/Bitcoin with this user and he lost. Time to see if he’s a man of his word and pays up
@_date: 2019-12-22 16:19:12
Price is 21,000,001 BTC
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:46:50
If only we could all go back in time.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:37:38
What's your investment?
@_date: 2019-12-23 23:40:16
We’re doing this publicly with accounts that are active, have good karma, and are a few years old. Plus, I have a record of paying when I lose
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:15:04
Is this a joke or a real statement? I honestly can't tell.
@_date: 2019-12-23 23:34:56
Cool, Just so we’re clear
Your backing the Vikings, I’m backing the Packers. If I lose I’ll send you 0.02 BTC if you lose you’ll send me 0.01 BTC.
If you agree, reply “confirmed” and or bet will be live
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:09:38
We all love and believe in you.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:45:48

Prices are lower in the morning? I did not know that. Thank you for tell me about that I'm sure it well help!
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:04:11
That's a great idea! Will make sure to look into that.
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:19:05
True but keep in mind that BTC at that time was valued at only $400. Faucets paid out so much BTC. Faucets can only pay so little now a days it questionable if it's even worth it.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:03:16
Those 2 deleted comments where just my reply that happened to duplicate twice.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:00:54
Thank you for the fine words of encouragement! This will be day by day if you care to see more.
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:16:10
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:15:48
Thank you very much! If you would like to here my full backstory I have a post on this subreddit explaining my backstory and my quest day by day.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:43:18
Congrats man! I'm still on that journey I even have a daily post on this subreddit that is dedicated to documenting my adventure day by day.
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:19:56
If you would like. I'm starting a day by day post of my journey on this subreddit. I just posted the first day if you want to go check it out.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:06:34
As I was reading this comment I was thinking... Did I leave this comment? I feel the exact same way bro. But even if you own the smallest fraction of a Bitcoin. You'll have made a huge profit in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:22:46
Thank you for the encouragement!
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:34:41
Very interesting idea. Thank you very much!
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:50:45
Wow! It sounds like you know a lot about crypto currencies in geanal! I will make sure to look into alt-coins but as for investing 2k. I'm only a teen so the only way I can get money is the occasional $10 allowance. Thank you very much for your time and advice. I believe this will come in very handy on my journey.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:00:33

@_date: 2019-09-30 20:42:33
I personally believe we’ll see 10K again before the end of the week but I’d like to hear other opinions too
10k or 6k
What do you think is next and why?
@_date: 2018-07-07 02:39:06
100% sure this will be a reality in 1-5 years
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:31:00
This. THIS right here is a building block to make step one of my journey. Thank you very much for your time and extremely helpful advice!
