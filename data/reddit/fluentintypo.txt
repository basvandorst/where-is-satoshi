There is no evidence that it was the russians except for them telling us. There didnt detect any traffic at all, only whatever logs were left on the server and they even said they logs dont say much since the hack was covered up pretty well. What they say that supposed "connects" this to russians are "markers". Similar domain names to other hacks. They dont say what these markers are exactly, just that we should believe they exist and are unimpeachable.  Now, half the hackers in the world use Russian based services or tunnel in and out of russia. Russia is indeed, a nation with rich hacking culture. That doesnt mean it was the russian government or even a russian attack. Exploits are bought and sold, especially right after they are successfully used and the owner is done with them. There is no way to say, with any assurance, that it was the russian government or even a russian citizen. 
Do you believe believe that North Korea did the Sony hack?

I draw the line at "our freedom" and reason we founded this country to begin with. 
Our founders were religiously oppressed people from europe. They knew what a tyrannical government was and sought to prevent one from starting here. Well, billions of lines of laws later, we libe under a tyrannical government, hell bent of never-ending war. This latest shit is just them pivoting from ISIS to "Cyberwar". They also just announced that they are going to train veterans and their wives in cyber security, ensuring that all those soldiers and military families will remain loyal to the government and be NSA's own cyber army....who spies on *us* for christ sakes. Why should we support any of that? Because of the "or else" clause attached to it? Vote for Clinton "or else, trump". "Support our war, or else terrorism" "Support our Cyberwar, or else, more Cyberwar" "Give up your freedom, or Else we will continue to cause more wars, make more people hate us, inciting them to do even more violence against us, and on and on it goes until you relinquish control over your lives and privacy. 
Its a racket. How are we supposed to trust the governemnt that has done everything it has done so far? Invading wrong countries, faking reasons to invade, literally selling weapons to groups who use those weapons on us? Fuck that noise.

So a person who bid 700,000 thousand in one go, thinking they would sure be the highest bidder, might lose out with 300,001 individual bidders help get it over the 1million mark? Thats fucked up. You either outright bid 1 million Btc or risk that the file will be leaked for free. Most people only cough up that kind of cash for an exploit if they know they are going to be the only ones with the code for a good long while. You dont pay that kind of money for somethi g that might become free any day now.

If it reaches 1 million, they release it for free. So unless you bid the full million up front, there is a chance that even if you an incredibly high number like 999,999, other bidders might oush the total over a million, hence the oerson who paid the high amount would not get exclusive rights to it.

A *similiar* name??? Why not the actual name then? Or how about this...an incrediblity competent nation-state might say, opt to use false usernames when executing a hack, because they arent idiots. But a US company, bent on starting the next generation of war - the cyberwar, which Obama *just* released his 10 year plan for, creatively interprets information that would further that agenda. 
Nevermind that the Whitehouse just announced plans to train hundreds of thousands of veterans *and their wives* in cyber security in concert with all the major US tech firms. 
Oir governemnt has a vested interest in keeping us scared and willing to give up our privacy rights and they use firms like crowdstrike, hackingteam, finfisher, and booz allen to do it.

I wouldnt say that the regulations *are what* allow them to rip off millions. If there were *no regulations*, the situation of ripping off millions would be worse than it is. Regulations both help crookery *and* enable it in some cases. There is no way that anyone could say that regulations are the thing that makes it happen though.

Thats shortsighted. 
This has nothing to do with "nothing to hide" which is a bullshit argument anyways.
This bill lays the groundwork for censorship and removes the ability to be private on the internet. Its not about breaking laws, its that anything you read or write online is logged "forever".  It also enables the private sector to censor the internet for their users. If they feel that people complaining about police militerization are promoting dangerous ideas, they can remove all that content and/or turn you into homeland security as a radical.  A law is forever, we have no idea what a "radical idea" will be in  the future, but its safe to assume that any idea that goes against the staus quo will be suspect. 
Another point - most of us enjoy reddit as an anonymous service. A bill like this could force reddit, a private company, to require "real names" because all anon services are suspect - if terrorist could use reddit to communicate, then reddit must be able to decloak all of its users in the name of national security.

Well, the point is that we cant vote it down - its a must pass bill and will be voted on by tomorrow. It simply going to pass and become law tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-12-17 22:24:22
It sets the framework to ban all kinds of internet access, including tor, yes.
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:03:03
You cant be anonymous without encryption. This bills is the first step to ban encryption and it empowers the private sector to be internet cops - if they detect "bad behavior" when you use their connections or services, they must, by law, turn you in and stop you (if this passes)

Which is one reason why gold could never be used to back a currency - too scarce, not enough to go around with a population that doubles ever X number of years. Its still fiat...fugasi, we apply fake value to it. We could have stopped literally printing money to achieve the same affect of limited supply, it would still be fiat in the end.
@_date: 2014-12-29 14:11:02
Yes, and if you increase the price to where only the rich can afford enough to buy anything? Failed economy.

Pssht, bitcoin is the grandad to the ultimate fiat...lets create fake money, not really backed by anything, give it fake "value" and let people trade it for goods and services. Sound like the dollar to me, except instead of a printing press, computational power is used. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 16:19:50
Yep, and as it is, I can afford to buy a gram of gold, but not an ounce. I can afford to buy a slice of a bitcoin, but not a while bitcoin. Imagine if either were a true non-fiat currency and actually in demand by every human on the planet. No one could afford it. My point remains....bitcoin is still fiat.

By "Unless Congress stops it" OP means "Until we, the actual users of these products, call and write Congress non-stop, they will pass this law, citing that no one but law enforcement formally submitted comments on the issue, so it was clear that there was no opposition except for that one press release from EFF"

Be prepared to wait weeks for them to acknowledge your order and they only accept bank transfers, no credit cards.

I bet we could turn this into a great net neutrality argument.

They are not saying its not safe right now, they are saying it wont stand up to quantum capabikities in the future. There was a good talk about this at CCC this year. 
This might be it : 
Actually, I think it was this one :

So, they didnt even know they were hafked but are pretty quick to pin it on "state sponsored hackers", aka, probably russia, just before an election debate. Priming the public for hillary sympathy??

Its pretty hard to get a legal residency in iceland. It would be one of my countries of choice until I looked into it and found it so difficult to be accepted.
