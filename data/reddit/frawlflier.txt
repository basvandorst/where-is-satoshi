@_date: 2017-02-19 05:59:24
serious. 
I've fell for the scam a few times myself.
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:24:40
What makes you think it will be rejected?
@_date: 2017-02-17 05:48:56
BTC isn't followed by the Gov. which makes this sketchy af
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:11:52
what i meant was, they can't touch your bitcoin. oops lol
@_date: 2017-02-24 07:07:45
I'm still learning about bitcoin but I assume people are cashin' out
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:51:54
I thought this is it.. I thought *this* is the last deadline.
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:57:55
Who let you out of class?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:35:40
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:18:54
welp, that makes sense. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:17:15
What makes you say that?
I've never heard of Tether, that's why I ask.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:22:57
Couldn't it change (up or down) just like BTC?
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:28:48
source faggot
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:21:28
i read this as "approved the ETF" and almost bought another coin 
@_date: 2017-01-08 07:06:30
I'll definitely look into both a lot more. Thank you again. It's nice to have insight.
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:08:08
Open coinbase.com, go to "accounts" from the left navigation bar, at top right you will see transfer.. click that and transfer the bitcoin from your wallet to your vault :)
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:53:06
Thank you for the first well thought out response!
Do you have any reasoning behind believing it will not "ever match the popularity of Bitcoin" or is it just a hunch? 
@_date: 2017-01-08 03:50:53
Still a little confusing to me as I'm young and new but thank you for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-01-08 03:27:00
And I'm assuming it's unlikely it'll be disapproved? 
I know nothing about either of the two ETF's you listed, let alone what an ETF is, but apparently everyone is excited for them.
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:23:05
Ethereum. ETH. The coin.

People keep hyping March up. 
"Wait til March!"
I'm curious what would have to go wrong, though I should probably be also asking what would have to go right.
@_date: 2017-01-08 03:26:02
can you dumb that down for me? 
I'm a noobie trying to learn about the stock market and every term relative to it throws me off.
I googled the definition of ETF and am still unsure what it is.
@_date: 2016-12-21 03:19:18
What would you suggest over Laboratory?
@_date: 2016-12-21 03:12:41
what do you use to invest?
should I opt out of the bitcoin lab because of what reason? 
(I haven't heard anything bad) 
here's the site: 
@_date: 2016-12-21 03:56:48
Okay. Thanks. I was too optimistic about this and got ahead of myself. It doesn't even make sense, if it were that easy to get 25% a week then everyone would do it. 
Yeah, I feel like a pretty big idiot because of how nice the site was, 24/7 support, etc. 
I'm going to withdraw my funds in 24hrs (because that's when I can) and then just hold onto what I have.
@_date: 2016-12-21 06:35:47
It cost me $10 for a learning experience, I'm not even mad. I'll just stick with bitcoin and trades. Gotta move on now :)
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:21:19
What does HODL mean?
@_date: 2016-12-21 09:36:29
eh, it's letting me withdraw earnings (hrly) and put them into my coinbase. 
So far have withdrawn half a dollar, lol.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:08:22
I cannot deposit anything; I'm checking to see if this only effects me
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:57:53
Bittrex doesn't accept fiat
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:03:14
do you still believe this?
