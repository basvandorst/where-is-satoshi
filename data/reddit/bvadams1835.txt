The last bitcoin climax was $20,000. The next price hike will be $100,000, maybe in 2-3years. Coingate has 5000+ merchant on their lightning hub, which will be adding more in the future. RSK bitcoin smart contract sidechain will be using lightning payments. Lightning wallets are not popular yet. Once the entire bitcoin eco system start using lightning, maybe I will make some money, but the price action need to be $100,000 or over.
