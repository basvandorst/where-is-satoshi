Usually not in America, unless the underlying contract states that attorneys' fees are a remedy.

I'm a lawyer. I really like the idea of judge.me—I mean, it's a truly fantastic concept. My sense is that one of your problems, so far, which is fixable, is brand awareness.
The other, which is more intractable, is the fact that judge.me as a matter of structural course uses *aequo et bono* as the sole interpretive doctrine for disposition of the case. I know you know what that means since you run judge.me, but for non lawyers, that is roughly equivalent to saying whatever the arbitrator believes is fair.
Most people, if they are going to submit to an authority to decide their case, want to *feel* the tribunal will be fair. Now, we can recognize all day long that even the established authorities have their biases and that the promulgation of law *qua* Law might be a figment of our pseudo-collective imaginations. That said, pragmatically, you need a way to assure people—**especially** bitcoin-trading people who know there's no way to undo a transaction—that the arbitrator will decide the case on some identifiable and potentially discrete set of rules.
Yes, that is the opposite of *aequo et bono* and yes, that would invite  an incredible price premium over the $299 fee, so yes, that makes the problem hard given your business model. But you should think about this more.
I would welcome talking to you if you want (and I think your business idea is great), so pm me if that interests you.
