Maybe because you'd have to be insane to believe this could possibly be real.

Sorry, can't edit the title, I meant to say .0969

Hopefully your 0.01 BTC will be enough to drown my sorrows should this come to pass.

I'm a bitcoin supporter, but that's just stupid.  Bitcoin is the currency of the successful future, but in a 'doomsday' scenario, well...  there won't be an internet anymore, and possibly not even electricity, so how exactly do you plan on accessing those bitcoins?
I mean, even paper money would quickly become useless...

It's called a stabilization, calm your tits.

There's a lot of drunks at the bar that know what they're talking about, too.
But they're generally drowned out by all the other, louder drunks.

Yes, by comparison.  But an extra 123Mhash/s isn't going to hurt, if I'm not using it at the time.

Considering they allegedly used the 'pre-order' money to fund R&amp;D, this is likely.
Still kind of a shame.  If he paid in BTC, his refund should be in BTC.  If we want this to be treated like a real currency, we should act like it.

It's hard enough to explain bitcoin to my friends, let alone a tech-illiterate judge in small claims court.

NC since PS1, baby.

NYMBOT!  I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE A HERO!  WHEN I WINK, YOU DUCK, AND I'M GOING TO TACKLE HIM WHEN HE'S NOT EXPECTING IT, OKAY?

Bitcoinity and Bitcoincharts, both down.
@_date: 2013-08-04 11:01:39
Except I didn't send them money, I sent them bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-08-03 22:02:39
If only they would refund the 9BTC I paid for a damned jalapeno that'll never arrive...

Just bought Borderlands 2 for a friend using this service, I'll let you guys all know how it went.
EDIT:  Took a little bit longer than I expected (25 minutes or so total), but considering they're doing this manually, it went quick enough.  Gave me a better price than SteamBits (since they took today's sale into account), and the whole process was very simple.  I also liked the little personalized note they added, nice touch.  Overall, would recommend and use again.

Thanks for the spoiler, asshole.

Not just that, but you can also use different types of cards.  For example, I'm using an old Radeon 5790 to mine 24/7, but my main graphics card is an Nvidia 680 GTX (which I only mine with while sleeping)
@_date: 2013-02-06 06:52:14
Sure, but there's nothing stopping you from moving your bitcoins around to mixing services and other wallets once you have them.
Hypothetically, of course.
@_date: 2013-02-19 19:04:47
MUCH better this way, imo.  The halo sent kind of a mixed message, but now it looks awesome.  Good work!
@_date: 2013-10-05 20:32:46
Don't threaten me with a good time...
@_date: 2013-02-24 20:03:02
It might, if I paid for electricity.

Because after all the horrible press and PR I see for them on this subreddit, and after waiting for "2 Weeks" that lasted more than 10 months, I had honestly given up all hope of ever getting my miner.
I'm upset it took so long, but my jaw dropped when I saw the shipping e-mail.  Just thought I'd share the news.
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:27:49


You monster.
@_date: 2013-08-30 04:40:29
I just got my Jalapeno yesterday, and the mug was broken in the box....
@_date: 2013-02-19 21:42:51
TL;DR:  If you just pre-ordered a Jalepeno, and are expecting it to ship after June, you're a day late and a few dozen Ghps short.
@_date: 2013-08-23 19:16:52
Just a Jalapeno

Funny that, I'm a geocacher and bitcoin fan as well.  I might have to start doing this at some of the caches I hit up - should be a fun way to give that 'treasure hunting' feel some actual monetary value.
Any chance we could get a link or GPS to this cache?  I'd like to know if it's in my area.
@_date: 2013-02-20 14:26:13
Kinda makes me worried for the next part...
