it totally is. get a wallet, visit some faucets for some free coins, start cpu mining on that old computer. doge is also very cheap right now, so it's nothing to pick up a few thousand for like $20 or something. tip with them, use them at places that accept doge, have fun with it. it's a fun hobby. :)

well, you could definitely invest in bitcoin on a small budget by just buying it and holding onto it. there is no guaranteed return though, like with any investment, especially currency. if you don't have a reasonably large budget for equipment then bitcoin mining won't be profitable, although it can still be done with a cpu or gpu. i'd recommend checking out as sort of a primer for using cryptocurrency. doge is cheap and fun to get into as both a miner and a user, and it will give you something to mess around with as you do more research and decide if cryptocurrency is a good investment for you. :) mine and trade some doge and start following the price charts, and it'll give you a feel for what investing in crypto is like before you plunk down ~$600 for your first bitcoin.

everybody's entitled to chime in with their $0.02, even if they choose to do it in doge XD

amazing! it's great to see stories about people using bitcoin as a currency instead of a tool for currency speculation. more stores like yours will increase the velocity of bitcoin's acceptance as a great way to pay for goods and services. right on!

you can try cpu mining some altcoins on your crappy old computer, you can even mine on your smartphone. you won't get a bunch of coins this way, but it's a fun way to get your feet wet and see if you like it. mining bitcoin is tough on a small scale, many people choose to mine altcoins and trade them for btc. i guess it really depends on what you're trying to do - if you want to get into bitcoin as a user, it's as simple as getting a wallet and buying some, then spending them at places where they're accepted. if you're looking at it from an investment perspective, the best thing to do would be a lot of research. it may be magic internet money but investing in it is still currency speculation, which you'll want to have a good understanding of before you start throwing dough at it. :)
