the average man. the average brain washed sheep herding citizen follows the celebrity's, the people who may or may not have individuality. my hopes is everyone will be more active into their personal lives and finances. half the reason we as a country have fallen so low is because of lack of responsibility and abuse of manipulation of those who follow the herd/ don't think before they act
