If you don’t understand or value the worth of regulation that means our money is secure, stable, insured then there is no point talking to you.
Volatility and anonymity are not good things for a currency. You don’t seem to understand that, you talk about money like a flat earther talks about going to the moon, like it’s some kind of government con and the banks are all in on it. It’s a waste of time talking to conspiracy theorists like you, you’re never going to stop and appreciate what has worked so well about fiat that they’ve lasted hundreds of years. BTC isn’t going to protect anyone from another crash if anything it’s setting up the exact scenario that caused the last crash (people banking on holding a huge asset which is actually worthless).
@_date: 2018-09-15 04:40:00
And you’ll find typically all bitcoin bears don’t understand or dispute basic economics and have no idea about the use of banks, government, taxes, central banks and monetary policy. They’re out here enjoying the perks of a fiat world with no idea that their fantasy would never work in reality.

That argument is just idiotic.
It’s the equivalent of someone saying governments are a bad idea because of Hitler.
Bitcoin is useless because another mtGox could happen any minute!
Your logic is complete fantasy.
@_date: 2018-08-09 02:54:03
Great in theory but it’s a fantasy. There’s no way bitcoin can or would replace fiat. The upsides are outweighed 10-1 by the downsides.
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:23:50
What you’re describing doesn’t even make sense. But regardless because the initial scenario doesn’t really make sense either.
Is this 10% volatility in a world where fiat and BTC both exist? If so what gets paid in what? For example if the shop keeper pays his bills and staff in fiat then as BTC price goes up and down his prices have to go up and down to reflect as much, but if he pays his costs in BTC then his prices would remain static. Now as a customer if you get paid in BTC well these two scenarios are very diff, one scenario a 10% drop in value of BTC means your purchasing power just dropped 10%. In the other scenario any drop in BTC value has no diff because 1 BTC always is 1 BTC.
But volatility moves in both directions do both have negative impacts, but talking about the impact you have to actually work out what world you’re picturing as all scenarios are different.
Anyway regardless, the downsides to using BTC over fiat are monumental so there is no chance BTC ever becomes the dominant currency so the entire conversation is moot.
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:17:26
Or you can actually do what normal people do and invest the money you won’t miss each month into shares, bonds, IRA.
Then come 10yrs time you will have an awesome nest egg. Might not finance the lambos and choppers you think bitcoin mooning will give you but you’re also not relying on something crazy happening where bitcoin actually experiences mass adoption.
Effectively right now y’all are throwing your savings into buying lotto tickets every single month. Instead of you actually saved that money you don’t have to dream about bitcoin mass adoption happening, you can be confident that as the world goes on your savings are growing and you’re getting richer all the time.
I really fear after the whole crypto bubble that there will basically be a generation of guys who have thrown all their savings away. It’ll actually be sad in 20-30urs seeing these guys who should’ve been able to retire having to work for another 20yrs.
Yeah, yeah I hear you all talking about being rich and getting your lambos. But wish some of you would just stop to think about this money ‘you can afford to lose’ and how if the world continues on as it has done for the next 20yrs instead of losing that money you could be sitting on some fat stacks.
Last thing I’ll leave you with is a shower thought from a few weeks back.
“There’s a scene in Forrest Gump showing that he made a ton of money from Apple stock purchased in the 70s. When we saw that scene we all thought ‘too bad we missed the boat on that one’”
For recent examples of this just look at amazon, they’ve gone up basically 100% in the last 12 months and it’s not like 12 months ago they were some no name or some niche secret little brand. Regular investing in the stock market will pay off, instead of investing assuming you’ll lose it all, try investing and enjoying compound growth each year. Buy Apple, amazon and Microsoft today and in 10yrs you’ll be infinitely better off than bitcoin with a fraction of the risk.
@_date: 2018-08-09 04:55:48
What are you talking about? The original example was 10% volatility in one day.
@_date: 2018-08-09 04:57:05
You have no fucking idea at all buddy.
As I said in my example it’s not the ‘fair market cost’ it’s the cost plus margin.
So as I said in my example if his costs are in fiat they will be very different to if his costs were in bitcoin.
Get a clue buddy.
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:34:47
That’s specifically the part I’m talking about all the way through my post.
I also have 401k and IRA contributions.
But instead of buying lotto tickets (aka bitcoins) with my spare money I’m buying shares.
As I’ve said in my post, instead of having to wait and dream about my lotto numbers coming up one day. Really all I have to do is give it time and in 10yrs that money I could afford to lose might just be a new car or holiday or a house who knows.
Y’all act as if it’s money you would just waste on beer and drugs anyway. Well if you have the will power to invest that in bitcoin hoping for a pay off, then I’m saying invest it in something more solid and don’t hope for a payoff just wait for your certain payout. Quit playing the lotto and actually save that money.
@_date: 2018-08-09 06:55:33
Yes it is bad.
1) tax evasion. We should all want taxes to be paid on all transactions that is how our society works
2) you convert from fiat to BTC. There is always going to be overhead and fees when converting one currency to another, why convert to BTC if I can pay in fiat?
3) paying in fiat and managing my fiat accounts is super simple and basic. Bank account or credit card, accounts are so basic and simple to use why would I bother maintaining and setting up wallets, cold storage, exchange accounts etc
4) I current pay zero fees to my bank for my savings account. It currently costs me zero to transfer funds to a friend. Funds transfer from my bank account to my friends bank account instantly and fee free using Pay ID.
5) and yes the volatility would be very bad. I have just saved up enough to buy a PS4, oh wait price of BTC just dropped 10% now I need to save for another month... save up that money, oh BTC price drops again now I gotta save more.... sure it can move in the other direction too but the entire idea of a currency is having w stable value. Volatility is extremely bad for a currency, anyone who doesn’t get that is a complete idiot.
There is literally no reason for me to use BTC instead of fiat at all. In fact using BTC would be costly (conversion fees and transaction fees) and time consuming (setting up accounts, wallets etc) and the with fiat I just tap my CC at the register and go. It’s the fastest, easiest payment method that has ever existed, moving to BTC would be a step backwards.

Crypto is not the solution to any of the issues you mention.
And why do I think wealth distribution is worse with bitcoin? Ahhh coz you can see what wallets are holding the most money...
96.53% of bitcoin held by the top 4.11%
0.01% of wallets own 21.9% of bitcoin
Yeah sounds great for us 95% who would only have 3.5% of the total wealth! (Although if everyone had wallets it would be closer to 99.99% of people with 3.5% of total bitcoin)
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:55:42
Dude as I’ve said your just just don’t understand the components of an economy. The simple fact you actually point to inflation as a bad thing (paper money is worth less every year) shows that you don’t get it. Once you allow the creation of money by anyone suddenly the value of a dollar would diminish like crazy and also fluctuate insanely as new technology advancements are made. Dude you seriously don’t get how all the various components work together to give you a stable, valuable currency and a functioning economy.
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:21:25
Lolll have you got lost? Do you know what sub you’re in?
@_date: 2018-10-11 05:15:41
Hahaha ok so you have obviously not read all of my posts in this thread because I’ve actually said specifically that it is decentralised currency that cannot work. If you put a centralised currency on a blockchain I wouldn’t really have a problem with it but the chain would need to be centralised and controlled by the government.
Yes in many instances taxes are easy to calculate for example the sales tax you pay on the ice cream at the shop. And even here in Australia we are getting to the point where a person working one job and doesn’t plan to make deductions will soon be able to avoid lodging a tax return but for people with investments, multiple income streams, dependents, expenses etc. You need a full tax return for the end of the financial year to summarise everything you’ve done that year.
As I said before adding a taxing algorithm to a blockchain that manages all payments in the world would not work for all the items I’ve listed above.
As for why decentralised won’t work I have explained this multiple times. There needs to be a central authority which manages the economy which makes sure that inflation is kept under control. Which makes sure that every citizen is paying their taxes. Which makes sure that people are not laundering illegal money or sending huge sums of money around for illegal purposes. You need a way to actually fund the government and everything they do without reducing the dollars that every one of your citizens is earning. You need to manage interest rates to a point to ensure that people do not go broke by having a home loan but then again debt can’t be too cheap to the point where the housing market booms out of control.
As I say you need to understand monetary policy and all the systems, regulations and processes in place that make our economy actually function. Moving to a decentralised currency would break most of these systems and would not allow for adequate replacements. Basically there is almost zero upside to a decentralised currency and countless downsides. But you think an economy is just about who prints money so you will never get it.
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:15:22
Wow what a garbage response. Things cost more today than 20 yrs ago because of inflation that’s pretty simple. There are many reasons inflation is a good thing for an economy and having a deflationary currency (like bitcoin) is a bad thing. Go and google this shit instead of asking me to explain the entire concept.
@_date: 2018-10-11 03:40:39
Sure thing buddy. If the entire tax code could be replaced by an algorithm it would’ve been done already mate. Our banks would be running the algorithm and taxes would be handled automatically. Blockchain doesn’t introduce anything that would make automating taxes easy, you are living in a dream land. You are one of these idiots who thinks blockchain is somehow gonna make us into gods who can fly and live forever. You are so deluded it’s not funny.
Dude you obviously don’t understand how inflation and deflation works and why we need government and monetary policy to manage the inflation. You can’t have a decentralised system where there is no control or management by a central authority. Otherwise you would be pushed around by the whales as all you crypto guys already are.
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:18:05
Exactly my point.
You just extrapolated my last line.
Neckbeards think an economy can run itself. Fact is without governments and fed inflation would be all over the place, wages and interest rates would fluctuate like crazy. The value of one USD would be as volatile as crypto. Then there’s the whole thing about how you’d pay for roads, healthcare, government, schools etc without being able to enforce tax evasion laws etc.
Y’all living in fantasy world, enjoying so many perks of a system you don’t appreciate or don’t even realise is protecting you, your assets and your income.
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:21:50
Lolll now you just sound like a crazy conspiracy theorist screaming on the corner.


Printing money had zero to do with the crash. As I said it was all about banks buying up bonds that were not as stable as they thought they were. While at the same time smaller banks and credit unions were incentivised to sell loans to people who couldn’t afford them because the bond market ate them up as they would always get high ratings despite the risk. None of this has anything to do with printing money at all. In fact if the government printed more money and sold government bonds to the banks instead of the banks buying up credit bonds from retail banks the entire crisis may never happened. You couldn’t actually be more wrong about the cause.
Then you go deeper into the whole us vs them crap with out any facts or figures to back you up. What are your thoughts on people who worked at Bear Stearns, from the top to the bottom. What about all the elites who owned Bear Stearns shares? You think the piddly inflation related to bailouts impacted you more than the people who lost money on the stock market during the crash? You’re delusional if you the rich were unaffected by the crash.
Oh and I love it when you sit there talking about the top 1% seeing it coming, converting their money, buying up later etc etc... had a look at any stats about how many bankers &amp; traders were out of work due to the crash? Yeah right they saw it coming and made money off it. There is the odd person who did (eg The Big Short) but they are in the tiny minority of the rich, most of them suffered way worse than you or I. You’re just spouting more of the usual anti bankers garbage on here with only conspiracy theories to back you up.
@_date: 2018-10-11 07:46:23
The reason I say taxes algorithm on a centralised currency chain wouldn’t work is because taxes involve items that are not just the input and output of money. For example the number of dependents (kids) you have may impact your taxes and the benefits you get from the government, or your healthcare bill/mandate. The blockchain cannot easily determine if the petrol you just purchased was a work expense for that big meeting you have in LA. Or if was just you filling up the tank for a trip to the beach. Taxes are insanely complicated and a simple algorithm looking at transactions only would not work.
Mate everyone right now has the ability to create value if they so choose. You can create art and sell it, farm produce and sell that, mow lawns and get paid, or as most of us do get a job and trade your labour for money. If you wanted to make money from the electricity grid you could do that by getting craploads of solar panels and selling the electricity back onto the grid. Right now people have numerous ways to create wealth, not every millionaire out there was born a millionaire. Much to this subreddits belief the man isn’t keeping you down and the USD isn’t keeping you down, it’s all on you. Don’t blame the system.
@_date: 2018-10-10 10:07:10
A system created and regulated by governments for the people of their nations.
Or a system run by a bunch of neckbeards with no understanding of benefits of tax evasion and money laundering laws and economic management done by governments and federal reserve banks. The bitcoin neckbeards just think economies run themselves. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:01:49
Your entire second paragraph is pure garbage. There can only be 21 million bitcoins mined so we can extrapolate to see what the distribution would be if all coins had been mined. Also right now probably 1-5% of the population have bitcoin wallets, meaning if we included the entire world population the distribution would be at least 20 times worse than it currently in bitcoin.
While your first para is also garbage. The tech has been around for 10 years and still does not have a single main stream implementation. With other tech usually it is a 1-3 yr window before it’s starting to become mainstream. Blockchain has been around for a decade and still has not had a mainstream win.
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:18:21


Oh yeah makes heaps of sense!!
Mate your whole concept is complete garbage.
I won’t even bother addressing it. As per the post on the front page the amount of proof and explanation I’d have to give here to make you understand what you are missing about taxes, monetary policy etc would take hours. Quite simply it’s the equivalent of you saying instead of someone going to school and the university to educate themselves everyone should just read a dictionary front to back and they will know everything. That is how ridiculous and simplified your system sounds, it is so flawed it’s not funny.
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:31:39
Hahahaha ok so you use fiat example of wealth inequality increasing to somehow make the case that over time wealth inequality in a crypto landscape would decrease?? Wow you truly are retarded. Ever heard the phrase money makes money? That is why inequality increases you idiot.
I know there are plenty of chains and cryptos and they’re typically all as useless as each other. For every one problem they solve they introduce 10 new problems.
@_date: 2018-10-11 03:20:54
Printing new money doesn’t increase wealth inequality it has zero to do with wealth inequality. As I said it’s about money makes money.
Think about it, you and I are both on 30k jobs but I have 500k saved up and invested in the sharemarket. On day 1 I have 500k more than you, in 10 years time I probably have $1m more than you. So inequality has just increased because my money made more money. Gov are not printing money and handing it over to the elites, you have no idea how any of this works mate.
@_date: 2018-10-10 14:36:13
Once again bitcoiners focus on one small area of the economy and say hey we can do it different but don’t consider that the entire thing is a machine with many moving parts.
How is money loaned out in this new world? How is rate of interest on that money regulated? How is the inflation of the currency controlled to be try and sit around 2%? How does the government create mass funds to pay for its various projects? What is the new version of government bonds and treasuries? How I do ensure I’m taxing people and companies according to the profit or income they are generating? While taking into account the costs of business etc.? How do I tax the billionaire buying his 10th property differently from the guy buying his one and only place?
There’s so much to an economy you are completely ignoring. A sales tax on every transactions could never work, the system is 100 times more complicated than that.
By the way your current idea is already working in the fiat world. Install solar panels on your house and sell your spare electricity back to the electricity provider. This happens in many countries around the world already. Though this money doesn’t come out of thin air, it’s a trade of resources as it should be.
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:35:47
Whether you use blockchain or paper notes to track the money isn’t the issue. It’s about regulating how the money is issued, tracking it, having control over it so that its value doesn’t sky rocket or plummet, ensuring you can tax people correctly and also prevent human trafficking, illegal activity etc. by tracking large payments etc.
So a gov issued and regulated crypto coin working as a fiat I wouldn’t necessarily oppose. But everyone into the crypto scene are excited about it for all the features you would need to strip out to make it work as a fiat.
For example governments need to be able to freeze someone’s assets. Banks need to be able to reverse fraudulent transactions and prevent transactions to/from fraudulent accounts. The rate at which new money is created needs to be managed/regulated by the government. There is so much involved in monetary practices and policies that go beyond just ‘regulations’ that keep the economy running and the value of your dollar up.
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:00:53
Lolll what next I’m being tricked by nasa about the moon landing? And everyone is lying about the earth being flat? Dude you are a fucking moron. Crypto would solve nothing it would just create millions of new problems. A currency that allows people to avoid taxes and gov regulations is never going to work and would be bad for society.
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:59:21
What has any of your post got to do with wealth inequality??
Bailouts happened because government decided the impact on society of letting so many banks go under would be bad for everyone. How we got into that situation in the first place was due to dodgy ratings systems that gave AAA ratings to assets that were extremely risky and should not have been relied upon. Yes the system was full of incentives to sell credit to everyone and anyone but the ratings put on bonds was the way to ensure that bad loans were not profitable for banks and credit agencies to sell to people. That is really where the system failed the ratings agencies were not truly independent and trust worthy.
During the crash I didn’t lose a cent. No one I know really lost any money at all. Other than super accounts/401Ks though again that was across the board so not sure what it has to do with inequality? It was actually those people holding bonds (the rich) who lost out. So yeah really no idea what point you’re trying to make here.
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:21:10
On a few points before I finally stop this craziness.
1 - your only argument against the current system and bonds etc is government collapse. As we’ve already established the only currency that works is a centralised one controlled by the government so if you only problem with the current system is government collapse, sorry to break it to you but that is a risk with any system.
2 - we got off the gold standard as it’s not sustainable, you are talking about moving to a system that we previously had and have now moved away from because we found a better way.
3 - just because the sun is free energy doesn’t mean farming creates wealth and dog breeding doesn’t. Breeder creates dog, sells it for $500. Transaction complete $500 profit minus costs to create the dog. Dog dies tomorrow, well there was $500 made and the dog didn’t cost nearly that much in food. It’s not a transfer of wealth, I am giving them an asset that I just created and they are giving me money. You know animals also need sunlight to survive? While plants also need water, fertiliser and maintenance to survive. And when you sell the produce or Apple tree or whatever it is you farm again you are not creating new currency you are receiving money for your goods from someone who earned that money elsewhere. Anyway you may not have made up the concept but in this context it’s not just garbage but it’s totally irrelevant and has no bearing on currency being used. As whatever the currency is it’s issuing needs to be regulated by the government you can’t have people just creating new money from nothing. We’ve already established that.
And that’s where I’m gonna leave it. Most of your post (as with previous posts) is incoherent, irrelevant drivel that doesn’t actually address any real process that could completely replace what we have now effectively. 
I guess the last thing I’ll leave you with is to tell you to go and google why we have moved away from gold backed currency and why we now have bonds and gov can print money. As listed in my previous post how does the gov finance a $10B rail project and then $50B for obamacare and then $xB for this and $yB for that. A resource based system is just not sustainable in today’s world it would only hold us back.
Edit: the only reason the system is more complicated than you can grasp is because I can see you don’t bother to even try to learn how it works, why it works and how we have come to this point. It would take time, patience and an open mind to understand it and learn it but you’re already against it and blame the current system for stuff it has no impact on. You hate a system you don’t even understand, so I can’t see you actually stopping to learn how it really works with an open mind.

Loll how are you being robbed?
You realise the wealth distribution of bitcoin is far worse than fiat right?
You’re looking for illuminati and elites to blame etc. But fact is society and economies are better than they have ever been and your quality of life is likely better than it has ever been. Rather than being robbed blind you are actually lucky to live in such a prosperous time.
Now yes the USA has major issues like shitty minimum wage, no universal health care, crazy student debt system etc. which can prevent the poor from succeeding.. but all of that is more about your politics than what type of currency is used.
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:01:28
Brand new? As I said it’s 10 years old and hasn’t been adopted mainstream anywhere. It will have some uses but it will be as transformative as when arrays or linked lists were introduced to programming, it’s not the new internet. The potential of blockchain is so overblown it’s insane.
So you have faith that wealth will move around freely with bitcoin but not with fiat? When in reality in a fiat economy with inflation people are encouraged to spend their money or invest their money whereas in a deflationary economy like bitcoin people are encouraged to hold their currency and not spend it. As you see now the big holders then manipulate the market and the price and whales bully you while they make more money. Facts are facts, distribution of wealth on bitcoin is many many times worse than fiat and there is no explanation for why that wouldn’t get worse rather than better especially when there will only be 21m of them. You are clutching at straws here buddy with no facts or figures to back you up just pure hope.
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:55:53
Lolll can’t believe after all of that you still are as delusional as ever. Yup sounds like a great system, gov has to produce electricity instead just printing money. That’ll work great, as I said we’ve all moved away from resource backed systems because we found a better more sustainable system with more room for growth. Not because of some conspiracy theory about Nixon and the Middle East.
Your only problem with the current system is that it is vulnerable to Gov collapse, as is any system. So yeah aside from being unable to prove any upside to your system you can’t even make a case for downsides to the existing system it’s hilarious. Good day!
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:07:49
Ok first up your wealth creation crap is just that pure crap. You didn’t address what I said about dog breeders. For example I have 2 dogs I bought for $500 each, now I can breed these dogs and create new dogs to sell for $500ea. I can keep doing this over and over creating new dogs to sell off. How is this different from a farmer who buys seeds, plants and maintains them and sells off his crop?
Regardless you have strayed so far off topic. And your entire post is a perfect example of what I said in the last post you are basically now trying to say yeah we would replicate every existing system in this new system except instead of the government printing notes they would produce kilowatt hours! Wow what an amazing revolution here this is going to fix everything! Forget the fact that right now for a government to fund a $10B railway project they can print money and issue government bonds... in your world they would need to generate enough energy to sell off for $10B worth of goods? Dude I could do this all day listing so many flaws with your concept though much like all these crypto fan boys your response is always oh yeah we’d just replace that with another system that works! Easy!
Dude the current system is so much more complicated than you can grasp and I’m just sick of constantly poking holes in your fantasy world. It’s a joke mate and I can’t believe after my initial post saying I wouldn’t waste my time educating you on inflation, taxes, monetary policy etc I’ve now wasted all this time on someone who refuses to accept the status quo is actually an amazing system and after I’ve pointed out numerous flaws with your concepts you fail to really point out a single problem with the existing system.
You describe banks as being issued the bonds by government and then being able to leverage up based on that. Bonds are assets and revenue streams purchased by banks (could be purchased by you if you can afford it) just like any asset. But you act like the concept of leverage is a bad thing, but without it your country would be in total shit. Businesses would not exist as people couldn’t get loans to start them up, people would not own their own houses as they would not be able to get loans to buy them. There is so much of society and the economy that relies on functioning banks in order for us all to prosper but you can only see the bad side and even then what you think is the bad side is actually the system working well.
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:54:43
You’re at least right in the sense that these days in America coming up from the bottom is harder than ever. But as I’ve said in the past that is not due to the currency, or banking system it is due to the politics of your country. If you all voted for universal healthcare and free college education (or a hecs system we have here) the debt burden on your citizens would drop dramatically and help to allow people to move up the classes. As I say it’s not at all got to do with the banking system.
Creation of wealth wow I don’t know who sold you that garbage but it is just that pure garbage. Farms create wealth huh? You do know that a farmer needs to buy land, seeds, water, fertiliser, pesticides, workers to sow the land, workers to harvest, then find people to on sell their goods too. Tell me how a farmer creates wealth but a dog breeder doesn’t? Or an artist doesn’t? Why is electricity production different from a company that bottles and sells water? Or a desalination plant? Your claims are insane I think you’ve been reading way too much reddit crypto forums. Regardless even if I somehow accepted your insane premise the entire reason you are trying to sell this idea is that you want a currency where people can produce their own coins/money by generating kilowatts or whatever. And as I’ve said a million times over you can’t have people just endlessly creating money without government regulating it, people creating money out of thin air would reduce the value of existing money at a crazy rate.
And then there’s your crap about taxes. That paragraph perfectly illustrates the problem with your entire argument. Instead of accepting that the existing systems work well and are designed in extremely complex way that has many moving parts to it. You just constantly try to claim (as others in these subs do) that step 1 is replace the currency and tracking system for it and then just work out bastardised hacked together solutions to replace highly complicated systems. We have this hugely complicated tax code and you’re like oh yeah we just change the whole thing to make it easier so it works with my currency idea. Ahhh yeah no mate. That’s not how things work, it’s like me saying you can’t get to China by driving a car you need to fly or take a boat and you’re like nah cars rule we just need to build a bridge there duh!! You guys try to suggest replacing the currency with another one that has a huge amount of flaws and will not effectively function as a currency and then when the associated problems are raised with other parts of the economy (loans, taxes, inflation, money laundering etc) the response is always ah we’ll just change it all so it works.
It’s like talking to a kid. You don’t just replace the professors at a university with monkeys and then say ah we’ll sort out all the other issues! But most important thing is we don’t have old white guys telling us about the future! To anyone who knows anything about how economies and currencies work that is how your ideas sound.

Hahahaha seriously are you like 15 years old or something?
Yeah dollar is heading towards zero sure thing buddy, you seriously are a complete fucking idiot.
When people farm and sell their goods they are exchanging it for money someone else has gained by exchanging their goods or services. People don’t farm money, they farm products that are sold in the marketplace.
Yes if the people lose faith in their government the currency can go to shit, we don’t have to look at the Romans’ for that we can look at Venezuela or Zimbabwe for that. But the fact some counties have problems doesn’t mean the entire system is fucked. Otherwise you’d make the argument that governments should be banned because look at Hitler and what happened there. Taking single examples to prove an entire system doesn’t work is ridiculous.
Please google about why inflation is a good thing, why wages slowly going up year on year is a good thing, why inflation creates an incentive for people to spend money or invest it rather than just holding it. There is so much to this that you have no idea about.

Didn’t once address how a government pays for things when it needs to. Government needs to mine X amount of gold before it can pay for obamacare or pay soldiers their salaries.
The dog is not a dependant if it can have a litter of puppies regularly that produce wealth. Do you think dog breeders lose money by what they do? I used dogs as an example because I knew you wouldn’t be able to see the similarities between a dog and a fruit tree when in fact they are almost the same from a breeder/farmers point of view. 
I’m ending here coz I’d like to ask you to explain further parts of your post but that’s like asking a Christian why god exists, you’ll spew more and more garbage based on beliefs and theories that are all just made up hogwash just like your theories about gold and Nixon. Funny that here in Aus we didn’t have a Nixon and neither does the UK, or Germany or France or Italy or Greece.. but we’re all running a similar system now aren’t we, yeah funny that. Your statement we could go back to gold standard and everything would be fine is ridiculous and crazy and I’m ending it here as you’re obviously delusional and refuse to learn anything about why the current system works so well and is adopted around the world and as I said before you still can’t find any real problems with the existing system yet your proposals are so flawed even I can tear them down.

You’ve proved time and time again you don’t I understand the basics of economics. Yes inflation can be a bad thing when out of control, but the best way for an economy to run is with a small amount of inflation. That’s how it works mate.
As for the rest of your post I am not even going to bother because you can’t even format it to a readable version it’s just one long rambling paragraph and I am not going to bother when it’s clear you have no idea about economics and think taxes could be just enforced at a transaction level on the chain. You seriously don’t have any idea about the complexities of the system you are trying to replace. As I said before it’s as if you are trying to replace the entire education system with a single dictionary. You don’t have a clue.


Do you even read the crap you write? Lol ‘would be ROI like in today’s economy’ Jesus man that has gotta be the funniest statement I’ve heard. It’s like saying I’d buy goods via a transaction like in today’s economy! Mate the more you write the clearer it is that you don’t even have a high school understanding of economics.

As I said I’d literally have to sit you down and give you an economics 101 course and I ain’t doing that. You don’t even understand the most basic concept on inflation being a good thing, never mind how regulating the creation of money keeps its value stable. Allowing anyone to create money would throw that into chaos, there is so much wrong I’m not going to sit here and explain all the components of an economy and how it works.
@_date: 2018-10-10 10:08:47

Lol right mate. USD is useless in America is that your point? As I said wages are defined in USD, loans and debt is issued in USD. Companies must pay their workers in USD.
And then there’s the entirety of the rest of my post about the economy, the Fed, interest rates etc etc.
But you have nothing to stand on so you’ll just pick one item and keep picking at it despite the fact your case doesn’t hold up at all.
@_date: 2019-10-01 03:01:11
Nope. I’ve described why the USD has regulated value. Being accepted in stores is only one factor I’ve described many more. But as stated in the link and our discussions usd is the only currency accepted in stores it is also the currency loans are issued in and debt is repaid.
You tried to attack me on a single point as it was the only possible area you could argue. In reality it was like arguing about the colour of the vaccine you declare is making your kid sick. I’ve just listed a stack of reasons but you decide to argue about whether it’s red or dark pink colour.
Edit: by the way I also don’t live in the USA, which can be said for most people in the world. You’ll notice many of the exceptions about not using legal tender relate to the USA in that link also. Basically you’re trying to claim a win due to a clause that says in some states in the USA people may be allowed to refuse it. Wow got me there bud! Bitcoin all the way lolll

Untrue, look into the law. Large deposits and transfers of cash must be declared.
Tell me if a politician received $2m in USD or in bitcoin as a bribe which one could the government investigate and prosecute? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:49:25
Yes trafficking is illegal and there are many laws in place to try and help track the transfer of large amounts of funds. This is why you don’t have $1000 and $10,000 notes. You need to ensure the rich are paying their share of taxes, you need to be able to ensure that politicians aren’t receiving massive bribes from influencers (though the USA is so corrupt your elections are paid for with bribes, but still a politician can’t just get a boat or a new house with bribe money). There are a million reason why the government needs to be able to see large transfers of funds.
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:03:56
Yeah and it wouldn’t take much for government to regulate in that area.. you just give access to the governments to be able to view the IDs of the traders involved, while it’s still anonymous to anyone else.
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:25:11
Shitloads of Downvotes incoming.... but...
What most BTC fanboys don’t realise is government regulation is the only way BTC survives and becomes viable. The more BTC pushes back against regulation the faster it will become redundant.
Anonymous money is not good for society at a large scale. Governments want to regulate because that’s what society wants, anonymous money leads to human trafficking, drug trafficking etc.
People here don’t accept that governments are generally the hand of society at work. It’s not the man trying to keep you down, it’s the establishment enforcing the laws the people wanted.
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:32:15
That’s why movements exist because the government no longer represents them. I’m sorry for places like Russia which claim to be a democracy but then kill off any opposition. I can’t advise what are the best ways to handle living in those countries, I wouldn’t advise giving any additional power to any government that is no longer representative of the people and opposition are known as dissenters who should be silenced/punished/killed.
This is also one of the many reasons a global currency doesn’t work. But that’s a whole other topic that BTC fanboys I’m sure don’t want to hear about.
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:30:08
Think we’re saying the same thing. BTC needs to embrace government regulations that already exist for money in order for it to be taken seriously and not stamped out.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:53:53
If the government is corrupt and persecuting its own people then you have bigger issues than what currency you are using.
So you’d be happy with no one ever having to pay taxes on anything they buy ever again? If I’m a billionaire I just convert my millions into bitcoin and buy a house and boat with bitcoin and never pay any tax.
The functioning democracies of the world aren’t going to just allow an anonymous currency to run rampant in their countries that will encourage and aide tax avoidance, drug trafficking, money laundering, people trafficking all because in another country somewhere in the world there is a government abusing its power and freezing the assets of its opposition.
Governments need the power to freeze assets for many good reasons. If the government has become completely corrupted and is no longer a voice of the people then any rules and regulations we talk about are redundant. If they can’t freeze your assets, they could just throw you in jail. They could just kill you.
The argument doesn’t hold up in a functioning democratic society.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:40:13
I don’t live in your messed up country.
Ever heard of ‘we the people....’ The government is the representation of the people, it’s not some oppressive force, at least in a free democracy. Unfortunately for you the USA is a pretty awful example of democracy.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:43:35
You have no idea.
Look into the history of money.
The only reason money works is because it is regulated. Employers have to pay you in money and stores have to accept your money.
Again you are the exact type of BTC fanboy I was describing who doesn’t understand that the government is a representation of the people.
Lol taxing energy, what an awful idea. I run solar panels on my roof and I don’t have to contribute for roads, healthcare etc. Also you have the poor paying the same amount as the rich. You have no clue at all. Go read a history book or learn something about monetary policy, taxes and money laundering.
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:01:58
Yes that is also one of the many problems it has that would be helped by gov regulation.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:20:34
Yes there are many ways to catch someone. But that doesn’t mean you just ignore and scrap protections in place that help. You get rid of gun laws because hey they can get an illegal gun anyway so why have the laws? Scrap the process of fingerprinting because surely you’ll find DNA instead... it doesn’t work like that. You have laws about seat belts and laws about speed limits and laws about drink driving, they all aim to prevent crashes. You don’t scrap some because the others might catch the problem.
It’s not about priorities, it’s about having a way to back track to the source of an issue when something bad is uncovered. Whether that’s someone supplying drugs or Russia buying political ads during the election, or identifying someone who is avoiding paying taxes.. Money needs to be traceable. Yes people find ways around it with offshore bank accounts, and the governments try to crack down on it. But they’re never going to allow a new currency that thrives on anonymity.
Not sure why you bring up whistleblowers and activists? That’s got nothing to do with the currency they’re using.
Government exists as a representation of the people. All people. Yes in America your government is probably the worst example of a democratic government in the western world due to lobbying and campaign donations causing your government to protect the interests of their donors (which is why you don’t have single payer health care, decent gun control and why your new tax bill will hurt the little guy). But in actual functioning democracies the government is there for the will of all people and the public do not want human trafficking and drug trafficking and money laundering to get a whole lot easier with the introduction of an anonymous currency.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:32:53
I didn’t say it doesn’t happen. The government does all it can to try and stop it happening. Society wants it that way.
People break laws, laws have loopholes. But when there is a massive glaring loophole/opportunity like BTC then it’s an obvious one for the government to shut down.
Fungible? Not sure what that has to do with this conversation. I’m talking about anonymous money, it’s a no go. Yes things need to be tradeable, that’s got nothing to do with the anonymity of the trade/exchange.
There are loads of other reasons I think bitcoin has huge problems but this sub would never want to listen to them. The most obvious one though is the lack of traceability on the money, and it should be the most obvious and first hurdle that bitcoin backers try to solve if they wish for it to go anywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:46:22
Lol just because it has value right now doesn’t mean it will hold value. That’s what a bubble is. Just because I sell you a box of rocks with an Apple logo on it for $2k doesn’t mean the rocks are actually worth $2k. Right now it has value because of the future that people hope it will have, as I am saying that future will be short and it will die a quick death if government don’t get involved.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:53:14
USD in very small amounts is relatively anonymous. It’s the larger amounts that become easier to track.
Does the government have access to that exchange info and can they detect when someone has made large amounts of profits that need to be taxed? In theory they can get access to the records and I am saying in order for BTC to survive they should be given access.
@_date: 2019-04-23 00:01:25

Oh so it’s not worth having security cameras? It’s not worth having metal detectors at airports? It’s not worth having NSA/CIA monitor chatter or internet traffic for terrorist command, child porn rings etc. You obviously have no clue how much privacy is already traded for security, money is just one of the most basic ones.


Yes money is digital now, easier to track. I said they don’t have big notes because you want to avoid untraceable large transfers, not being able to do it with notes means they have to do it digitally which means it easier to track. That’s the whole point mate.


I used the rich as an example, it’s not the poor guy with the minimum wage job that is going to receive massive payments on bitcoin and buy property or land with it. Who is avoiding taxes now using offshore havens etc? It’s not the poor.


Once again you’re back on the point of “oh if they can find one way to do get around the law what’s the point in having any laws at all?!” That’s a crazy argument, might as well get rid of murder laws because some people get away with it.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:42:56
If you want a real answer instead of all the fanboy responses like ‘coz they have to maintain the power!’ then read my comment further down the thread below... basically the first reason is you can’t have an anonymous currency. Whether that’s because they (on behalf of all of society) want to collect taxes, detect money laundering, catch drug or human traffickers, the list goes on.
It’s funny I’m sure half the people here are against the top 1% avoiding taxes on their money currently but when it comes to bitcoin they’re raging hard-on (and 500% gains) tells them oh fuck taxes! Fuck the government!
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:29:19
It’s illegal not to. That’s the point. If he doesn’t declare he’s breaking the law.
Without laws everyone will do it with no fear of anyone ever catching them.
Yes theoretically BTC could be tracked, it’s about setting up a system and signing up for government regulations to allow them visibility.
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:17:22
You don’t understand how an economy works. Anyone can create a currency that doesn’t need government, it’s government monetary policy and regulation that means it keeps a relatively stable value and the economy continues to grow.
Bitcoin is like inventing plastic and saying hey I can use this as a currency it’s better than USD! But really the way to have plastic money is for a gov to adopt it and manage it. Bitcoin/crypto is a tool not the system.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:52:11
Useful for criminals yes. Good for society, no. Society needs a functional government, banking system and regulations and taxes to be able to prosper and function as a free market should. Trustless money would destroy an economy and society nevermind the depreciation factor and all the other issues with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:47:10
Long, long story.
Short version is it’s a stable coin. But problem is that it’s owned by the same people as Bitfinex. So instead of just acting like a stable coin (sell for $1, buy back for 98/99c) they actually use their bitfinex exchange and the unlimited supply of tether they control to push craploads of fake volume through the exchanges and pump the price when needed. One example, just look at the various times when tether has had big print runs and it always lines up with a crashing bitcoin that just recovers/stabilises when the tether is printed and pushed through the exchanges.

No large scale criminal organisations move large amounts of money across borders. They don’t do that with cash or want to leave paper trails, this is why crypto is popular with them.
The government is doing its best to keep the economy running well. If you had a currency that was independent of government you would be going to work on Monday for a paycheque worth 50% of what it was a few weeks ago. You need a stable, working government for a good currency and economy.

There’s a shitload of parts to it:
-	loans
-	lines of credit
-	capital raising (IPOs, equities, bond markets)
-	actual banking accounts for storing/receipt of funds
You can say oh what about credit union, loan sharks etc. But we start getting into the definition of banks and what they are. I would say right now in the crypto space exchanges are pseudo banks in many ways (accounts, leverage, line of credit, exchange/brokerages).
Without businesses easily having access to credit &amp; loans and the countless home loans issued around the world daily the world and economy would grind to a halt. But this is all an ELI5 version of things, banks and our banking system is so ingrained into the day to day world it can’t all be replaced with a new asset type.
Crypto wouldn’t replace banking it would aim to become a new asset class or currency which could be managed by banks (or exchanges can be regulated the same as banks). But any currency or asset class that refuses to be regulated and (for currencies at least) controlled by government is doomed to fail. Something this sub doesn’t seem to get is that taxes and regulation are good and 100% necessary.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:17:52
Lol if this was the stock market and it’s been around 100 years you could say bear market no worries.
But are we going through a beanie baby bear market at the moment? Is the tide pods challenge just hibernating at the moment? Dude it was a fad, it was hype, it was all for nothing.
Talk to anyone in here about technology and economics long enough and you’ll realise there is no good scenario where BTC wins out. Anyone who holds that belief doesn’t understand economies, currencies, government, regulation and taxes. Bitcoin is garbage, it’s not a bear market it’s just the end of a hype train.

Where in that did you describe a mainstream adaptation that equates to cash for all the Hodlers in this sub? I’ve said there may be uses but they won’t be based on people mooning their coins on exchanges. You don’t actually need blockchain to share computing power and have decentralised hosting, but I’m not going to say and I’ve never said blockchain will never have a single use. It’s the expectations in here that any coins y’all are holding will mean anything and there’s no reason for any of you to care about the backbone technology that could be used to share resources for an AI system. Some of those projects may find uses but the current crypto scene, coins and discussion is fake news about fantasies. Just look at the ico scam rate, people just ate them up and will cling onto their coins till the last possible moment.. sometimes even after it’s all been revealed.
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:23:37
Ok follow these steps:
-	look at total transactions on the chain
-	look at the total transactions on all the biggest trading exchanges
-	subtract  from 
Just removing the obvious trades from the total figures will show give you a number that is a tiny fraction of mastercard’s volume. Can’t believe you are even trying to debate this, you don’t honestly believe bitcoin is anywhere close to MasterCard in worldwide transactions for goods and services do you? That is absolutely crazy, it’s like me saying I think more people in the world have only 1 hand compared to the number of people with 2. It’s not even close.
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:51:02
You can go grab a count from anywhere you like. It’s very obvious to anyone with half a brain that the majority of transactions on the chain relate to trading bitcoin rather than purchasing goods. If you don’t believe that you are a complete moron. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:45:22
You realise a trade on an exchange is a deposit/withdrawal right?
I buy bitcoin on an exchange and that bitcoin is deposited to my account in the exchange and then I transfer to my own wallet. You think none of that is done on the chain?
@_date: 2018-11-24 00:29:14
Dude you literally just posted that moving back to my wallet is on chain. Wtf, any one who knows anything knows you don’t just trade and leave it on the exchange you move it to your wallet.
Edit: you could even make the argument that for every 1 exchange trade there may be 2 on chain transactions. As the seller moves from his wallet to his exchange account and the buyer moves from his exchange account to his wallet.

How safe an exchange is doesn’t define whether it’s a bank or not.
Many banks provide brokerage services too, but they also allow you to exchange your money to other currencies. They’re also the main way to send money to and from other people. They also provide lending services and all sorts of other things.
Though even if you took the view that exchanges are like brokerages my original point still stands that an exchange is just the crypto equivalent of a financial institution unless you don’t consider Goldman Sachs etc as financial institutions?

Lollll it’s so funny seeing people who have no idea just roll out all the lines. That first one is my absolute favourite, it’s backed by math!! Wow so stupid you couldn’t make this stuff up.
Even the fact you talk about freeing you from global banking, regulations and taxes shows you don’t get it. Taxes and regulations are good, without them you would be living in a wasteland. Censorship is good, would you rather all subreddits didn’t have mods at all and it’s just a free for all?
You’re a result of our easy lives now where you think someone can just create a new currency and get rid of all these old things! When you have no idea that the current system is a result of hundreds of years of evolution and things like taxes, regulations and censorship are actually good things but you’ve never lived without them so you don’t understand why they exist.
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:51:38
It’s just a fact.
You can look at the transactions on the chain and almost all of them are people buying and selling bitcoins to each other.
MasterCard can’t be used like this, when you use it you are buying something from a merchant.

Ha hahaha I’m shocked. Same as always with you crypto guys. Instead of actually debating the point and facts you just try to turn into a bet because you have no actual logic to use.
You want a bet I’d happily bet on real terms. Compare the value of investing $10k into S&amp;P500 today vs $10k into bitcoin today and compare the value in 5yrs. Happy to take that bet, $100k bet good for you? I want 5% interest on my money in the meantime though.

First of all a continent is not the same as a country. Secondly crypto has not replaced fiat. You tell me to look at countries where it’s working but in those continents you listed people are still paid in fiat, buy things in fiat and work daily with fiat. Crypto is not ‘working’ in those continents just because there are a few trades going on and it occasionally gets used.
Anyway all of this is pointless after your first line..


Wow. Ok so when you come up with some fantasy world that doesn’t need taxation and regulation to work you get back to me. Would love to hear how you think schools, roads, hospitals, police, fire departments, prisons etc etc all get paid for. You say manipulation is a bad thing but so is regulation?! Dude regulation exists to try and prevent manipulation, just look at the scams in ICOs in the crypto space and how much money was lost! You think regulation would be bad? Dude you’re a fucking child.

Never concede to what mainstream is saying. Even if it means riding it all the way to zero.

@_date: 2018-11-24 12:37:23
Your literal words were “no one cheats on their taxes”. 
That was your only attempt to try and actually counter the point that taxes and government regulation are the only way a currency, asset class or an entirely new economy or whatever you want to call it works. You have no clue and I trust my money in my share portfolio than some guy who talks shit without having any idea how the world works you’re a joke and setting up a bet with you would be like responding to that Nigerian prince that was emailing me.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:43:01
You have no idea how money works. The government, federal reserve and regulations do a lot to ensure you money maintains value, the economy works well and they limit as much as and tax evasion as possible. All of these are good things done by the people for the people. You have to get over your paranoia of government and realise you live in a society and benefit from government projects daily that your taxes pay for. Blockchain is nothing more than a tool, if people decide to use it track an ledger of numbers good luck but as I’ve said above it can’t replace an entire economy without oversight, control and regulation.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:46:15
She should be the poster girl for this sub. Basically sums up everyone I know in the crypto game. Always claim you’re in it for the tech and future but when someone actually asks them about taxes &amp; regulation suddenly it’s all about moons and memes baby!! The crypto fad will one day be one of those stupid trends like beanie babies and tide pods.

 1. Controlled by Banks and Governments
This is a good thing, it means that your money will always be sccepted by businesses in your country. It is controlled and regulated to maintain value in the short term and slightly lose value long term.


yes this ensures it keeps it’s value. you dont have a random fork happening or a few groups of people creating money out of thin air for themselves (mining groups). All money supply is tightly controlled to ensure stability and a smooth economy.


also transferred using bank cards, credit cards, entering CC numbers online. it can be transferred immediately in physical form with no internet/computer needed but can also be transferred digitally instantly by just inputting a few numbers


any delay is usually still faster than crypto. (waiting on my CC payment to process is usually 2-3 seconds), bank wires using PayID are instant and free. Or i can use paper/coins instantly.


visa &amp; mastercard cover you for all fraud. you just report it and they refund it. WAY more money is lost to crypto scams


 1. Not Controlled or Centralized by any one institution
this means price can sky rocket or plummet at any time. also makes enforcing laws like taxation, money laundering hard to enforce. Also means you cannot get refunds or assistance when you are scammed or lose money.


yeah and so are viruses. what’s your point? it has limited supply making it deflationary and awful for use as a currency.
 


lol so what??? made up out of nothing with no reason as to when it is made or why. normal currency is regulated and managed by governments to keep the economy running well, ’code’ is not looking at the economy or current price of bitcoin and deciding to stop making any new coins because the price is tanking.


Almost always it is slower, more expensive and more difficult to transfer than if you had used FIAT.


not true. just look at the number of scams and hacks in the crypto space lately. the fact you cant get a refund/reversal for when you have been hacked/scammed shows fiat is more secure.
there you go! your easy explanation shown to be complete bullshit ��

No clue who Roubini and Krugman are. Everything I have said is basic economics 101. Anyone who understands how an economy or currency works and what role the government plays in that would say the same thing. It’s nothing exciting or controversial.
Loll yeah I’m totally going to make a bet on such loose terms. I have outwardly said it’s not blockchain that is the problem, the problem with current blockchains is the lack of control. If you had a government issued crypto currency and the government was the one who determined when new coins were generated and they had control over reversing transactions, putting a hold/block on accounts/wallets etc it could actually work. But the current concept of a currency existing without any government controls or oversight is pure fantasy.
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:37:45
Lol love your argument there. Exchanges are banks you idiot. The world needs loans and secure places to store their worth. That need doesn’t just disappear. Just like every other bitcoin bro here you drink up all the lines but don’t actually think about how the world works.

Why would the outlook for crypto be better? It’s had shitloads of attention and mainstream companies taking a look at it to see how they can implement it.. and the result? Fuck all.
Over time there may well be blockchains running b2b systems and internal systems for multinational or distributed companies.. but there is no reason to think an asset class will be useful, desirable, stable or mainstream in the long term.
You first sentence shows just how little you know. So stock market will be completely replaced by crypto will it? Even if stocks were tracked on blockchains instead of current methods it’s not like the stock market would go anywhere. You crypto guys seem to think if you phone started using an MS SQL database instead of an oracle database it will suddenly sell billions and be able to cure cancer.
The gaps between your insane claims about the future and the actual reality of blockchain and crypto technology and how businesses and economies work are obvious to anyone with half a brain. But people around here are like 
1 - blockchain
2 - ??? 
3 - profit!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:15:41
If you bought and sold beanie babies at the right times they would have paid for all those things. How much you made from speculating on it doesn’t actually mean anything about whether it’s useful or not.
If crypto was actually useful there would be at least half a dozen mainstream chains that are used every day by normal, regular people every day. Fact is no chains have gone mainstream because typically a blockchain implementation of anything is less efficient than existing methods. No one has really found a great use for it so far, so no it’s not infinitely useful.

If only you could actually see what a world without fiat and running on bitcoin would be like you’d suddenly appreciate how amazing fiat is.
Bitcoin has about 10% of the features that fiat currently has. It is in no way possible to replace fiat. I wish people like you would actually educate yourself on the financial system and why things like inflation and deflation regulation, taxation, fraud control are all essential to a functional economy.
Bitcoin fans like you think everything is about transferring money from one person to another and trying to do it without a middle man. There is so much more to fiat and the economy than that.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:29:28
Loll it’s so good talking to crypto bro’s in this subreddit. Every single time they try to turn it into insults, or bets, or brag about money made. But the one common theme is they will never carry a convo on about the fundamentals because they know at the end of the day it doesn’t work or they’d just rather stay in their bubble and ignore reality. It’s so good to watch ��
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:55:23
Wow you really are a bit slow aren’t you? 


Unaccountable? Really? You think banks or credit card companies are unaccountable? You really are clueless. That is exactly why the bitcoin and crypto community needs regulations to create accountability and safety for people. If you want to trade off all of your safety and security for an immutable ledger when your current banks ledger has never had any problems previously go right ahead. I’ll stick with my bank and ability to claim fraud and refunds on scams.


Never said blockchain is useless. Just that bitcoin is, there’s a huge difference.


You obviously don’t understand safe haven investments like gold. The fact you are even describing that it could be used as a currency like cash or as a commodity like gold shows you know nothing about how currencies or commodities work. As for the usb thing, is the safest place to store your bitcoin not on a trezor wallet? I understand you don’t trade physically normally but I was describing an end of days type scenario where commodities and safe haven investments become major assets.


Well i think what we have established here is that bitcoin has no real advantages over existing currencies or commodities, just a lot of flaws. Hell you dont even know what you want it to be. This conversation is a total waste of time, you have no clue how the economy works.
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:25:41
Lolll your comparison should be more like comparing a Model T to a canoe. Bitcoin can’t and won’t ever replace fiat. Currency doesn’t work without regulation and taxation.

@_date: 2018-11-24 07:24:54
The ATH was 7 weeks ago but the peak of the bull run was in Jan this year. The ATH it hit 7 weeks ago was an eventual recovery from the corrections all year and didn’t last long.
Regardless, OPs claim that stock market is at ATHs right now and bitcoin at year lows is wrong. Yes bitcoin is at year lows but stock market is well off its peak and if you did try to buy bitcoin when stock market was peaking you wouldn’t have bought at the bottom. OP is a complete tool.

Venezuela’s problem is the government not the banking system or fiat.
This is true of any country where the currency goes to shit.

Of course no one in this sub thinks it will die because you all live in a massive crypto safe space. Visiting this sub is just like visiting where skeptics are told they are just spreading fud (aka fake news) and put their hands over their ears.

Banks have fractional reserves which means they don’t hold all your cash, but they do have assets that represent all the cash it’s just those assets aren’t currently in pure cash (they have real estate, loans, bonds etc).

They are not comparable at all, quit spreading misinformation.

Haha I’ve actually advocated a health record type system but even then it would be a b2b system also. You wouldn’t have something reliant on public processing and variable unknown costs. You completely disregard the downsides of having public chains and the biggest myth of all is the money to be made. No one is going to buy into these systems to make your coins worth anything, it’s like you’re all holding Disney dollars for Disneyland’s that will never be built or maybe they’re working but no one has any interest (BTC). 
Just like this sub you fail to see that the current system is a result of hundreds of years of evolution and BTC/blockchain can’t replace the entire system. Government, regulation and taxes weren’t just invented by the bogey man.

Oh wow, a resume that’s impossible to fake! Though even if it somehow was legit (which I’m sure it wouldn’t be) your claims about taxes just show that you’ve either become completely mentally retarded in recent years or you’ve always been a compete and utter moron.

Reddit is a good sample of the crypto community because the crypto community is a perfect sample of the most stereo typical Redditor. Without reddit the crypto scene wouldn’t have had a quarter of the success it has. I also fit that stereo type so every friend I work with and talk to in IT was on about crypto with about 75% of them getting involved at some point, a lot of the time out of pure FOMO.
Problem is the majority of the crypto scene are in it for the gainzzzz... and don’t really care that much about the tech or if they do they completely misunderstand what it can or might do. As with many tech advances, 99% of people in this subreddit would and should have no involvement or interest in the tech, they just see the results... when Microsoft released MS SQL or JavaScript hit the Internet did the general public have any idea what was up? Did you have subreddits all trying to invest in a JavaScript website?
The dot-com bubble in some ways is relatable to this bubble but not in the ways that people here would like. It’s true that maybe some blockchains survive the pop and will be around in 10 years.. but the concept that people will make money is the problem, the business case for business platforms running public chains and buying coins from a public exchange is just crazy. No company wants their critical systems beholden to some anonymous miners and nodes which could switch to mining another chain at any time... costs and performance of the business system can’t be guaranteed or forecasted it doesn’t work.
So maybe one day business systems running blockchain will work, but it’s likely they would be private chains that can be easily controlled, costs and performance can be easily forecasted, monitored and managed. But as we are seeing now, in most cases where blockchain would work it turns out it’s not the ideal solution, it’s generally already been solved with a better solution. So I think in time it may find it’s use in certain systems but 99.99% of what is talked about around here and the reasons for people being here are total BS.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:17:30


Not apples and oranges at all. You said the chain is immuatble and thats great thing about it. i asked when has that ever been a problem with your bank? Sounds like never. you’re the one that brought up Cypress.
But ok let’s talk about systemic risk then. You say the ledger is immutable. I would say the entire system surrounding the ledger is more vulnerable to fraud, hacking and losing my money without any chance of recovery or retribution than any bank. Just look at the volume of crypto that has been lost to hackers in the past 12 months alone, compare that to how much money people lose via the banking system. Hell I can leave my visa in the cab, someone takes it and spends up on it, I can then claim all that back due to fraud and I’ll get my money back no worries. Your immutable ledger wouldn’t reverse these transactions, if someone managed to access my funds im fucked. Wow that immutable ledger is great until it’s not.


Yeah you’re right I’m not going to spend all my free time reading a theory about money to understand how you have convinced yourself that because bitcoin has a limited number that it somehow makes it a good commodity to trade. In other commodities with limited supply they are generally valuable because they have a use (like oil, gold, silver). In the event the economy went to shit no one would want to buy your usb with some bitcoin on it, couldn’t give a shit how rare it is. It might as well be my teeth (well actually they’re actually more valuable as they could be used in dentures). Bitcoin has no purpose.


So your original point has no legs. You said one reason you love bitcoin is because you have control over your own money. Now you’re claiming you have just as much control as we have over fiat (and I’m the one grasping at straws?). It’s clear you have a better variety of options for controlling your fiat than you do for crypto and most options are far more secure and reliable.
As for the last part well it really comes down to what purpose you see bitcoin having. You seem to regularly compare to fiat but now sounds like you’re saying it wouldn’t replace fiat. So in that case I can’t see what purpose it serves. A replacement for gold type safe haven investment? Hmm yes that’s just what I want something that has no intrinsic value and is not accepted or wanted by 99% of the world and the one time I may want to cash out it’s likely to drop to $0 value as no one would be buying when I want to get out. It makes an absolutely horrible store of value and an even worse currency.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:28:37
Yeah sure thing, you try living in a country that has deflation and no taxes see how that works out. God there is some idiotic stuff said in these subs.

@_date: 2018-02-05 10:54:28
News is news. The media outlets have no skin in the game either way.
The news is bad at the moment because the inevitable is happening, regulation is finally kicking in. It’s like you’ve all been living in the Wild West where people get away with murder, scams and the like. Much needed law enforcement arrives and all you cowboys are saying talk of law enforcement is just coz they wanna kill the bad guys instead of you just doing what you want. Truth is an unregulated Wild West was never sustainable and is good for no one except the outlaw cowboys who were taking advantage of the situation.
Oh and banks etc have no fear of bitcoin taking over because it’s literally impossible for it to replace fiat. Anyone who thinks fiat could be replaced by crypto has no idea how the financial system works and what the federal reserve actually does.
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:20:31

you’re the one that said when i said bitcoin is worthless that i was saying a distributed ledger is useless. As i say here the tech itself will be useful in certain scenarios. But bitcoin and pretty much all existing cryptos are not it.

Hahahaha I don’t believe your credentials at all.
The fact you are even saying that governments protecting their ability to tax people is a bad thing just goes to prove the point you can’t even grasp how the world works.
Bitcoin replacing fiat would take our civilisation back hundreds of years. Overtime it could be fixed and could evolve with protections for fraud, money laundering, inflation, deflation, price manipulation etc etc... but we’d eventually end up with similar system to what we have today.

Would love you to go and live in this world without government and law and order. See what a true criminal society is like. Any high level corruption going on today has very little to do with your puny bank account and daily trip to the ATM. You guys all dream about bitcoin saving you from the next financial crash while being totally blind to the bubble you were creating... The thing that was going to save you from losing all your money and defeating the big bad boys, was itself just a load of hot air and a pipe dream that robs the common man of more money. It’s just stunning to see people go on about ‘the man’ taking away their USD and debasing their currency while their dream currency is currently draining their wealth and being debased by the big players in your ideal economy. It’s truly amazing.
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:26:43
I understand how it works and that’s why I know it can’t replace fiat as a currency needs help to be stabilised and governments need to be able to fund huge projects. While law and order and banking are all critical parts of a society. All need regulations and government oversight. You enjoy the perks of a civilised society but dream of anarchy.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:45:41
Hahaha it’s not like that at all.
The current system is the result of hundreds of years of evolution. Today we enjoy the latest advances such as a worldwide payment system that can handle over 50,000 transactions per second (Visa), credit, home loans, bonds, shares etc.
We have numerous processes in place to deal with issues like fraud, inflation, deflation, money laundering, price fixing/manipulation, identity theft etc etc.
Bitcoin and cryptos usually address maybe 10-20% of the functionality of fiat but just ignore everything that is below the surface. The fact that you know the job you currently have will pay the rent for the next six months is just a result of everything below the surface that bitcoiners ignore. They think oh I wanna send something to someone and I can have it verified by people on the chain is all I need! But the system is so much more complicated than that.
As for your analogy, going to electric cars from petrol cars is the equivalent of replacing paper money with plastic money. Replacing fiat with bitcoin is like trying to replace cars with bicycle that has a steering wheel attached but has two flat tyres and a chain that falls off every other day.

Hodlers are suckers.
The term HODL is created just to try and convince people not to sell because it would hurt your gains as the price goes down.
It’s nothing to do with the tech or the future of blockchain. It’s a dumb meme that helps convince idiots to stay in the game while their cryptos drop to become worthless.

Guess you never drive cars or fly in planes because they’ve also crashed sometime in the past 5 years. Surprised if you’d even cross a street coz a car might hit you.


That was exactly my point. Why the fuck would I want any bitcoin? Just because it’s rare doesn’t make it valuable.


Ah so then why is this cold storage wallet better than a safe, vault or the wallet in my back pocket? If I want control myself I can put my cash somewhere I’d like to store it, but as most people agree I’d rather leave it with a 3rd party like a bank as it’s much safer. Except with bitcoin and crypto the golden rule is not to leave it on an exchange because it’s super unsafe and will get hacked. Yeah great system you have got there.


Ok now you’re just making up sentences out of incoherent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and are void of any actual logic whatsoever. Even if I try to make sense of what you’re saying, you need to consider how much savings an average person has. The average American has less than $1000 in savings... which means most people are living pay check to pay check. When it comes to testing bitcoin like a currency you can’t actually afford to hold out for the price to come back to a reasonable level.

It’s not the USD that is being lost in exchange hacks.
It’s not USD that bitfinex/tether are likely using to prop up the markets.
It’s not the banks that are taking the exchanges offline during crashes that prevent you from selling when you want to.
This is just the stuff we know about. I’m sure there is so much manipulation by the whales running the exchanges.
Hell one of the biggest &amp; dodgiest exchanges (bitfinex) doesn’t even do USD deposits and withdraws does it?
And so far we’re just covering the dodgy side of exchanges compared to banks. Don’t get me started on what banks and fiat provide the economy that exchanges and crypto don’t and never will.

Just call everything I say ad hominem and then you can move along pretending that you dealt with it all. Good technique mate!
No I don’t think it’ll hit 100k in a few years. It will never even hit $20k again... you are so paranoid about bit bad evil bankers ruling the world but then couldn’t give a shit about bitfinex and tether pulling off the biggest scam you’ve ever seen. You couldn’t care less that share market and banking system had shitloads of protections and regulations put in place to protect you from the banks and brokers. Nope you’re too desperate for a quick buck that you’ll run over to the exchanges and let them front run you, let them manipulate the price with wash trading. Let them just print billions and billions of tethers to pump up the bitcoin price.
The irony is fucking amazing.
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:42:39
Yeah that’s why gold is seen as a safe haven investment.
It’s not about returns it’s about protecting your money.
That’s why I asked you, how much would the maximum loss be at any time in those 20 years? You didn’t answer me.
Personally I don’t hold gold I hold stocks. I have google, amazon, Apple, Microsoft.. Microsoft and amazon have gone up over 100% in the past couple of years!
Bitcoin tanking 10% right now. Real great store of value there.
Edit: also I see you changed my time frame from 20 years to 30 years to show much worse returns. Wow I’m shocked.

Bitcoin and blockchain are inseparable? So I can’t have a blockchain without bitcoin
You fool obviously they are separate. I actually used this example to say that in theory a crypto like tether running on a blockchain could theoretically replace the dollar if a central entity had control of the chain.
Jewellery debatable whether it’s used because it costs more or because it last a lifetime and looks good and is desirable. It’s a chicken and egg argument. But as I said in my example why is it used in electronics manufacturing? Because it works better than anything else for a similar price! Simple, that is intrinsic value. If you remove trading of the asset for speculation and investment and look at the real life use cases and value in industry or society that is intrinsic value. If gold stopped being traded as a commodity tmrw it would still have huge value for electronics and jewellery. Bitcoin has one purpose and use only, trading. That’s why it has zero intrinsic value.
Wow there is just so much crap in your post I can’t respond to it all... Bitcoin is easier to transact and store than gold? Yeah good one mate. What happens when the power goes out? You’re broke you idiot. Oh a massive network that wastes shitloads of power and has redundant copies of data thousands of times over that is slow and inefficient to keep in sync is a valuable asset? Yeah no thanks.

Global economy is definitely having a bit of a slump at the moment.
But this has zero to do with how the economy functions and more to do with the global conditions and the people elected to hold power. Without Trump’s trade war many think the global downturn wouldn’t be anywhere near as bad as it is. Him yelling at the Fed all the time doesn’t help either.
Fractional reserve is the only system that actually works in today’s day and age. But every system is reliant on a competent government to run it.

What you are talking about is anarchy.
Basically having no state backed currency. Having no laws that you are forced to follow.
If you scam $100m out of people with a fake ICO it seems you believe you can keep that.
All criminals can just avoid anyone taking their profits or proceeds. Go kidnap a class full of kindergarten kids and sell them off to the black market for millions of dollars. It’s all good right?
No mate. Humans have evolved over hundreds and even thousands of years.
We now have governments, banking and stable currencies. US government even recognised in the early 1920s the economy was having too many crises and created the Fed to help calm things down. For the good of everyone.
No and you’re actually wrong about debt collectors having funds seized from my account. If they go and get a judgement against me in a court of law that’s another thing.
But you are living in a society and enjoying the fruits of that society. Such as schools, police, firemen, roads etc etc.. and as part of enjoying the benefits of that society you need to pay taxes and follow the rules.
The rules aren’t set by some illuminati they are set by the people you vote into power. The government is by the people for the people.
You have no idea how good you’ve got it. You’re like a six year old sick of bed time and not being allowed to drink soda after 7pm.. so you wanna run away, you’re trying to convince everyone you can make it on your own all you need is bitcoin.
But that’s because you have no idea how the economy works. Why coke didn’t suddenly cost $10/can during the GFC. Why interest rates go up and down. Why money needs to be printed.
Trying to live in a bitcoin world would be like a six year old trying to make it on the streets of chicago alone... you are trying to take all of humanity backwards hundreds of years.
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:21:53
I’ve said many times blockchain could find uses. Most likely in private controlled chains.
But for bitcoin itself as I said. It’s useless as a currency as it’s not backed by a state so no one has to accept it. And it’s useless as a store of value as it has no intrinsic value (or use).
Mate your final question doesn’t make any sense. Do you imagine one day the entire world explodes and we are living virtually? Of course not. The world evolves one day at a time and we have great tech advances every day. Apple released their credit card about a month ago. First fully digital credit card I’ve seen (you can request a physical copy too). We are already living in the digital age.
As for which asset will be worth the most? Hey if I knew that I’d be rich!! But I’m taking my chances right now I’m holding shares in google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and quite a few other tech companies. Equities are the assets to hold mate. Always have been always will be.

For some parts it is easy. For a change of this level it won’t be simple. It’ll cause major issues I expect.


That’s the idea though, that there is already trust with a private chain. For example Microsoft builds a chain for a network of doctors offices and hospitals to connect to. These are the real world solutions where you don’t want to rely on public resources and have performance and costs reliant on how many of the public are on your chain. Private chains are actually feasible for business unlike public ones. Again you say it’s not immutable, but that’s just untrue. That’s based on how blockchain is built you can’t say private chain is not immutable.


Well don’t say ridiculously dumb things then. Like a private chain not being immutable or secure. Of course it’s immutable. And being private means the chain would be secure from 51% attacks or people corrupting the chain with bad data.


As I said, if it does exist we are already in it. But you can’t seem to explain what it is anyway or how it would be different to now.
Wow ok.. the rest of it I’m not even going to go point by point. This is where you drift of into some delusional imaginary land. I suspect you are about 21-26 and have visions of the world turning into tron in the next 5 years and you uploading yourself into singularity in the next 20 years.
Nothing you talk about has any connection to the real world. Can go on and on about digital assets and digital world, but you are even saying the digital assets wouldn’t be linked to anything physical should just be 1s and 0s and you know what that means? They are worthless because they can just be copied and replicated a million times over. And in cases where they are not replicated like bitcoin, why would I want it anyway?? Why would bitcoin be worth something in this world but lite coin is not and eos coin is not? They are all equally garbage shitcoins. Why would you want to own anything that only exists as 1s and 0s and why would anything that exists virtually be worth anything? Just like a copy of the latest video game, someone could sell you 1 copy for $1000 or they could make 50m copies of it and sell it for $100. Why make just one unique one for you? There is no point and in reality what is that worth? Nothing as it has no intrinsic value.
Same with your understanding of schooling. Yeah leave an 8yr old at home to learn on their own while parents are at work, great idea!!
Same with your understanding of Gold.
Any idea why there is gold inside your mobile phone. Your TV or your stereo?? Any idea why the manufacturer didn’t just use silver in that phone or stereo instead? If as you say it’s just as good and it’s cheaper?
Fuck me you don’t have a clue about any of this. Just some kid dreaming about being in the matrix but no actual understanding of any of this. Just dreaming about putting on his VR headset and then the need for banks, shops, government, economy, schooling, jobs, protection etc all just disappears! Yeah good luck with that one mate.
Edit: let me sum up what you mean by digital world etc.... you are saying that you value bitcoin because it has simulated scarcity. Or fake scarcity. It’s not actually a rare resource that is unique or may be consumed. No it’s a digital token created for the sole purpose of appearing scarce. When similar coins with similar properties and use can be created for free infinitely. It’s essentially a digital casino chip but if everyone can spend cash at the casino why would anyone ever bother to exchange cash for chips. Especially considering casino can go out of business at any time.

 Not at all. I’m saying that no one ever has any problems with what you are describing unless they have fucked the rest of us over. You are arguing to make things worse. When has sovereignty of your money ever been an issue? For 99.9% of people the current system works perfectly. And it means that when someone rips them off or steals their credit card etc they won’t end up losing money. It’s the system that is best for all of us. But you’d prefer a system where criminals are protected and if we get scammed or someone steals your money or guesses your password etc you’re just shit out of luck. SFYL. Nah mate that the current system is 100 times better thanks.


This is where you’ve been brainwashed. It’s like someone saying we switched from horse and cart to cars with engines because we wanted to win wars. Horses are shit in war compared to tanks!! If our society wasn’t so obsessed with war we would still have horse and cart and things would be amazing!!!!
Ahh no you’re just so wrong. We moved to a new system because the new system allows the economy and country to grow faster. Creates more jobs and opportunity for people. You don’t see countries changing back to gold standard do you? No because it’s a step backwards like going back to horse and cart.


Cash doesn’t need me to be online. Billions of people live in cash systems around the world without need for payment systems. Fiat can do this.


Nope not true. Can’t physically pay someone in bitcoin without updating the network. Can’t just create more money to issue home loans or build infrastructure. Can’t keep all my transactions secret from everyone on the chain. All the list goes on for miles.


What’s the point in having laws? People still get murdered. You need to stop the murders, laws are useless!! Mate just because credit card fraud protection processes get better all the time doesn’t mean we should just get rid of the ability to refund or reverse transactions. Why go backwards? Why not have protections and then also have refund ability of protections fail? That’s how the world works, don’t just have seat belt and no airbag or airbag and no seat belt.


How do banks issue loans? How does the government print money to build stuff? How do we ensure inflation and the economy keeps growing? You don’t have a clue mate.


No wasn’t talking about income tax at all. Even in a bitcoin world income tax isn’t so hard to collect as you can identify salary transactions etc. Taxation i was talking about is the kind of stuff very easy to hide with bitcoin like buying property etc. Tax evasion is a massive problem and bitcoin only makes it worse. Btw your idea about tolls and shit is useless too, how do you charge a toll for the police force, fbi, CIA, nsa, nasa, fda, epa, dod etc? You charge me $10k fee every time the fbi arrests someone? Yeah good one. You don’t have any fkn idea at all.
Oh yeah let’s fork the chain every time government needs to build a new school or hospital, tank or freeway!! Great idea! Mate your view of the world is so childish I can’t keep discussing this.
Edit: well I’ve been banned from this subreddit as expected. Crypto peeps can’t handle anyone speaking the truth. So unfortunately I can’t reply to your post below but in the end it doesn’t matter too much as it seems your post just has deflections rather than any real responses. You literally have responses like ‘nah uh you kenseyian fool!’ Or ‘nope you were talking about income tax so I’ll ignore all your points!’... yeah sure I was talking about income tax, because when we talk about tax evasion and propel having assets seized for tax evasion it’s due to income tax, yeah right buddy give me a break!

Exactly. This is what I’ve said, it requires everyone to be involved and work together. I’m sure some people hope to have just bought bitcoin and leave it for 20, 50 years or so. But seems if they don’t get involved in this move they’ll just lose it all?! Also it’s great in theory to come up with a plan but to get agreement, organise it and have it executed by everyone that needs to is not that simple. Hell im sure at the start of all this no one expected these various bitcoin forks, I’m sure if I go over to btc they’ll tell me that’s the true bitcoin!


Public or private this is always a problem. Hell you haven’t seen the articles going around about what a 51% attack would cost on various chains? Hell Chinese government bans crypto mining and shuts down power to the biggest bitcoin mines and you’re all fucked. But public chains have a lot more risks than that. Hell people uploading child porn that gets replicated across the world is a very simple way to fuck up a chain. Man there are loads of ways to screw over a public chain a lot worse than a private one.


So redundancy, replication and immutability are not worth anything now? Trustless transactions not worth anything? You can have a process to authorise who is added to the chain but once added each transaction doesn’t require central authority so each transaction is still Trustless in the same way as public chains. Central source is used to authorise new nodes and any maintenance, updates, printing of new coins etc. Actual functioning of chain is the same. You don’t seem to understand the tech. But yeah typcically in 99% of blockchains public or private they are just inefficient databases.
Oh you’re the digital world guy. Fuck said I wouldn’t waste more of my time replying to your garbage.
That’s it I’m not writing any more. This crap about first digital asset and digital world is on silicon chips inside warehouses etc... you are just a complete moron.

Yes but this only increases the deflationary nature of the currency.
Let’s use a tiny scale to make it easy to understand:
-	in a town the government has 15 million bitcoins and the residents have 6 million split among them
-	for this example let’s say each citizen has 0.5 bitcoins
-	initially each coin is worth around $1m
-	in the first 10 years the government spends 5 million of the coins they now have only 10 million left
-	is the value of the coins is altered so that the government still has the same amount in the bank, so 10m coins they have are now worth the same as the 15m coins they used to have
-	this also means that 0.5 bitcoins each person had is now worth 0.75 of the old bitcoins!
What does this mean? Because it’s a deflationary currency as the supply lowers the value increases. But in an economy this is a really bad thing! Because none of those citizens would want to spend their bitcoin, they would want to wait for the next re-distribution when it’ll be worth 50% more!
Now this is a super simple example of how an economy w a deflationary currency would work. Obviously in the real world it’s much more complicated and they don’t rebalance after 10 years, you just have a rate of deflation.
I don’t care how many times you can cut each bitcoin up into pieces. With a limited supply 1 bitcoin will be worth more in 10 years than today. And that is an awful thing for a currency and an economy.
@_date: 2019-09-21 14:52:00
It’s a combination of usefulness and scarcity. As something becomes rarer it becomes more valuable and as it becomes more useful it becomes more valuable. Working out the exact value of each is a combination of the two.
Bitcoin has no use. So despite being rare it has no value.

Hahahaha and what has csgo skins got to do with bitcoin? The skins are actually useful for something so they are more valuable than bitcoin!
But really skins and fads like that are like beanie babies they’ll be popular for a while and then they’ll crash at some point. So no they wouldn’t be a good store of value.  But they might be a good investment if you got in and got out at the right times.
And game theory has nothing to do with this either.
Fuck I love coming on this subreddit. Everyone uses all this shit that they think makes their arguments intelligent, they’ll talk about Austrian vs Kenseyian system and ad hominem arguments and even I see game theory!

It’s gold ��
@_date: 2019-09-25 03:31:10


That's not what I said. Fiat already makes it easy to break the law. Bitcoin is traceable as you admitted yourself. Fiat money can be laundered.
Is there a point in there somewhere? Yes you can break the law using any currency or store of value. But one of them has processes in place to help law enforcement enforce the law. As I said someone tries to run to the Bahamas with $100m of fraudulent funds, if it’s in the banking system it can be stopped or seized. If it’s in the crypto world that money is lost until they catch the guy if they ever do. And even then maybe they can’t get it back.


Governments did it because they would be able to afford to wage war ad infinitum. They keep the gold and the populace is stuck with pieces of paper with no supply limit.
Nope. Just because your country is addicted to war doesn’t mean the rest of us are. In fact the only reason most of us get into war is when your country asks for us to join in. What are you talking about they keep the gold? We are not running on a gold economy.


Lol this is where you guys have been fooled. The world has already worked out that a currency needs to be state backed in order to work. That was worked out a long time ago. Now you want to go back to a completely uncontrolled system, that is the dark ages. Just because it’s stored digitally doesn’t make it futuristic or useful. Compared to the current system it’s completely useless. For every 1 upside it has compared to the current system it has 10 problems. But end of the day none of it matters because running an economy on a limited supply and a deflationary currency that is limited to digital exchange is a complete recipe for disaster. But as I said you can’t fathom how an economy works, why we have interest rates, exchange rates, taxes, quantitive easing, inflation, government bonds and printing money.... if you don’t understand how it works how can you even suggest a system to replace it?!


Ohhh so now you’re back to arguing that if you are a criminal and you owe people money you should just be able to keep it.
And no Cyprus and Venezuela don’t make the point.  Because I can reference over 100 functioning economies around the world running on state backed currencies. Are you saying coz once there was a Hitler then the idea of government is wrong? Or look at Mt Gox that shows that crypto can never be trusted!! Random examples of failures don’t show that a system is broken, it shows that particular case was broken.


They have money to spend trillions on nukes though? Even hospitals in the states at least cost a fortune. What exactly is free there?
Wow you really are that dumb.
How much did you pay to go to primary school? You think any fees you paid covered the cost of the school, paying the teacher, all the resources etc?
What about the road out the front of your house how much did you pay for that?
How about the train station, or using buses or trains in general? You really think they make profit from public transport? You think that’s not a huge cost to the state?
How about FBI, CIA, NASA, FDA are you paying for all of these too? Dude you don’t have any fucking idea about the world you are living in.
Yeah healthcare is expensive where you are coz republicans have convinced y’all that public healthcare is socialism. The rest of the developed world has free healthcare and we love it. And yes our taxes pay for it but we don’t pay crazy taxes you might think.


USDBTC has dropped several million per cent since Bitcoin's inception. Which is the more awful and who is the brainwashed one?
Lol you mean to say that BTC finally has a bubble of hype a little while back? Wow so did beanie babies. I’m sure there’s also thousands of shitcoins that has insane returns too which are all worthless now. So what? Not much of an investment or store of value when it only lasts a couple of years before crashing to shit again. Majority of people who got in after the boom started were fucked. But like you they hang around hoping another boom will happen one day.

It’s not a private company. Tell me who owns the federal reserve then? If it’s a private company... it’s not it’s an instrument of the government.

Now zoom out on the stock market, eg the Dow Jones... see how it just goes from bottom left to top right over any long period of time. Yeah that’s what real assets do.
Worthless and useless yes I said it.. because it is. Why would anyone want to buy it or use it? It’s totally useless, the dollar managed by the state is superior currency. And commodities such as gold are better stores of value or safe haven investments. Bitcoin is worthless, has zero intrinsic value and will never be a currency.
Yeah it is actually preferable for criminal activity because as you said it can’t be seized. If I wanna rob you and run with $100m it’s best to put it in crypto and run. If it’s in a bank or gold it can get seized.

Not fear mongering at all. That is my point, updating other systems is a lot easier. We can roll through new security patches all the time and new security protocols quite often this will be another roll out... but for Bitcoin it will be a much larger issue. Aside from its rigidity there is also the issue of ownership, responsibility and group rule. That all are not good things for long term maintenance of critical systems.
Ah I did answer your question. And you are wrong, the benefits are the same. You think a private blockchain isn’t immutable, borderless or secure?? Dude you don’t even know enough about the tech you are trying to defend here!
There is no upside? So you didn’t read my points or just decide you’ll ignore them coz you can’t address them? Guaranteed performance, costs and support are 3 very simple concepts anyone else would be able to understand. You’ll find an example of failed private chain to say it’s not the way to go? Hmmmm let me just grab you about 600 failed public chains.. you idiot.


What the fuck are you talking about?? You have created some fantasy about some imaginary digital world in your head. You are delusional. I have equities and they are all traded via my trading app, transferred the money in and out electronically, all records are stored in IG markets databases. Dude just coz you say ‘digital world’ doesn’t actually mean fucking anything at all.


Again I love this logic so much... we’re running away from state controlled and bank controlled money to crypto!! And what’s the reality? You’re basically running away from a hospital that gives free immunisations, to the backwooda witch doctor. When money and trading is involved everyone is out for a quick buck and a scam, this is why we have financial rules and regulations. Things to stop front running and wash trading that just milk you of money. Rules about collusion between entities without public shareholder disclosures etc etc... but no you want to run off to the Wild West where it’s been proven by MIT and Harvard that 95% of trades are fake wash trades. We have seen Tether and Bitfinex lie and manipulate the market. And best of all without rules and regulations of course every exchange is going to do front running and shut down for maintenance when they don’t want you selling etc. And best of all the witch doctor has somehow convinced you it’s the hospitals and vaccines that are the big bad enemy! It’s so hilarious!


Nope there is zero logic to that statement. You still need schools, police, firemen, fbi, CIA, nsa, nasa, fda, irs, epa, doj, dod the list just goes on and on and on. You make zero case for why government would get smaller.
Why is bitcoin different to a shitcoin? It’s not. It just currently has more idiots who like it. Why is gold different to other materials because of its conductive properties, it’s ability to be cast into anything also. Various minerals and commodities like silver, nickel, platinum, oil etc all have their uses and hold value. Bitcoin is just another worthless shitcoin.
Oh but wait “Digital World” ohh ok yeah you convinced me we need it. Lol, if that term means anything at all we’re in the digital world already and bitcoin is still useless as it was 10 years ago mate, only thing that has changed is some propaganda subreddits now exist and they’ve recruited a whole new round of suckers to pump up the price for a bit.
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:37:51
Lolll been hearing that shit about 20k, 50k and 100k for a fair while now.
Just you wait till NYAG is done with Tether and bitfinex and the whole thing comes crashing down.
The bitfinex and tether relationship is worse than anything in the banking world.
@_date: 2019-09-21 07:55:39
So are my teeth.
My teeth are actually more similar to bitcoin than gold because they have a specific number we know of.
Gold, no one knows how much is left. As it just keeps coming, closest approximation to a supply is infinity.

Why would the seller take $100k from me instead of $200k? The seller doesn’t want some stupid loan system they want their money now.

Yeah that’s why we have laws and regulations. Ever had the bank change your account ledger directly? It’s a total fallacy that an immutable ledger is a good thing.

No the market cap proves there is a hope. Loads of people missed the tech stocks rise and want their own bit of fortune. People buying lottery tickets every week doesn’t mean lotteries are essential it just means a lot of people really hope to win and get rich!
You can say the argument about gold is bullshit.
But truth is how much gold is being purchased today for real world uses around the globe?
Go into your office and count how many people are wearing gold wedding rings, necklaces, earrings, fillings etc etc.... all these people paid the spot price (or more!) for that gold.
Then there’s the electronics industry and the gold that is inside your phone, computer etc.
It’s also tangible and easily traded and easily identified and makes a good transfer of value.
 Bitcoin on the other hand has no use other than giving to someone else. And even then how do I give it to them? Via a complicated process that relies on a network and computers, pass phrases etc.
The comparison is asinine.
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:58:46
Lolll mate you are the fool here.
Let me break it down for you.
Bitcoin and gold both purchased as a store of value.
Bitcoin is never purchased for anything other than store of value.
Gold is purchased for the following reasons:
-	jewellery
-	wedding bands
-	electronics
-	other conductive uses
And I’m sure there’s plenty more.
Now the price someone like Sony would pay to plate their connections would be the spot price of gold. If there was another material that was as good at the job but cheaper they would use that material. There is not. So they use gold and pay the spot price for an actual physical purpose.
Now tell me why would anyone buy bitcoin for anything other than holding and selling?
That’s what is meant by no intrinsic value.
But even with an explanation a 3rd grader could understand you still won’t get it and you’ll call me the idiot. This sub truly is amazing.
@_date: 2019-09-28 23:41:19
Mate please before spending your own money, listen to some people outside of the bitcoin and crypto subreddits.
These places are just propaganda machines where everyone is incentivised to try and sell you on bitcoin and the amazing future it can lead to. Generally anyone who speaks out is banned and any points they make are labelled FUD and they are shouted down. This is because it’s not profitable for them to acknowledge bitcoin’s issues, they just want to pump it up. The more buyers the more their coin is worth.
But in reality they don’t understand anything about a functional economy. They have no understanding of why the fed exists or what it does. Why we have interest rates, exchange rates, quantative easing, money printing and taxation. They have no appreciation that fraud protections built into existing systems are a million times more important than immutability.
And then the other group that will sell you the idea that it’s a store of value will completely ignore or redefine what it means to have intrinsic value. They’ll completely ignore the fact that thousands of people and businesses buy gold every single day for use in manufacturing or jewellery etc. Giving it an intrinsic value.
 Bitcoin is actually just a modern version of beanie babies. With an entire crypto market bursting with scammers and opportunists who can exploit an unregulated market full of people out to make a quick buck.
Please read up a bit about economics and what real economists think of bitcoin before wasting your hard earned money on it.
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:18:02
Human civilisation has been growing for thousands of years.
Economy will hit hard times occasionally and then will go on to rise again. Look at any stock market chart over long periods of time.
Unless we put a limit on people having kids and stop research that allows us to process resources 100 times more efficiently than we used to then there’s little chance we will come to a grinding halt.
And you want to bet on a currency that will only work if the entire world comes to a halt and everything starts going backwards? That’s a great idea. Ignore the thousands of years of human progress and bet on the end of the world, great idea!
@_date: 2019-09-24 04:19:00
Yeah they are. You either invest in the right things (my investments in Amazon and Microsoft are up over 100%) or you work for your money and create goods or sell your service/skills.

@_date: 2019-09-19 07:16:01
Lol go on explain the examples you’re referencing there...
How is the government robbing you every day? By providing you protection, security, schooling, transport, tv, radio etc. If I recall correctly they actually saved all your savings, mortgages etc when they bailed out the banks. Without that I expect mortgages would be foreclosed, savings lost, people left utterly broke. You’ve had things so good for so long you have no idea what being robbed really is.
Oh great continues without central governments, really? Please point me that direction id love to go visit a booming economy that has no central government... which country let their banks collapse and how do you define doing well? I suspect those who had money in those banks wouldn’t be happy they went under?
@_date: 2019-09-23 01:46:36
Wow you really are dumb.
It’s spelled unaware. Seems like you barely finished high school.
Dude I’ve given you loads of starting points to look into. I’m 100% sure you can’t answer any of the questions I listed!
It’s very clear I understand way more about bitcoin and blockchain than you do about the economy.
Can keep attacking me and ignoring the facts if that makes you feel better.
It’s the usual crypto bro way, argue by their rules where they will ignore everything that you say. You sit here and attack me and my style or arguing instead of attacking any of the facts I’ve given you. Next up I expect you to just start yelling FUD!!! I can’t hear you FUD!! And you can ignore the facts some more.
Even asked you to answer very simple questions like what does the Fed do and why does the government need to print money. And you can’t answer those. You can’t tell me how a currency can work where the government doesn’t control it and we don’t have a Fed and printing money.
Your counter argument is to link to a gold coin someone created 20 years ago that no one uses. It’s amazing! A coin no one uses, sounds identical to bitcoin.
Edit: tried looking at your own arguing style mate? You refuse to acknowledge anything unless I answer your specific question the way you want it. You ignore everything I write and then complain about how unaware I am? But this entire time you literally are refusing to read my posts or discuss any details unless I respond the exact way you want me to and argue exactly how you’d like it to happen. You see how blissfully unaware you are? Refusing to acknowledge anything I post because it’s not presented how you like it? You’re a fucking baby who doesn’t understand the most simple aspects of a functional economy.
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:37:06
Hahahaha exactly the response I expected.
That’s usually the final line from any crypto bro. Once I’ve explained why it’s useless and you keep changing your argument as I keep shooting down every single one of your points.
Eventually you run out of points. They’ve all been destroyed. So your final resort is ahhh man you just don’t get it.
It’s hilarious. I love it.
Just ask yourself why does the term FUD exist in crypto? Because crypto pushers are afraid of the truth. They can just throw the word FUD at something and they can just ignore it. Instead of actually having to think about it and realise hey that guy is right. It’s such a cult and a religion that y’all are so brainwashed and desperate to get rich by doing nothing only bankruptcy can bring you back to reality.
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:47:03
Yup your parents gen survived just fine, their parents survived inflation just fine, their parents did too...  but of course the whole thing is gonna come crashing down anytime now, coincidently just after you’ve discovered bitcoin. The lack of ability for people in this sub to grasp how much they have benighted form the current system always astounds me. But to be expected I guess, the old saying goes don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone.... or grass is always greener.
And can’t believe you keep mentioning the wealth gap. As the wealth gap in BTC is 100 times worse than the one with USD
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:52:15
Dude it’s not social engineering it’s economics.
Taxes are used to pay for government expenses. In your world where the government prints no money, they aren’t able to move taxes to stimulate or ramp down the economy. They must have the taxes pulling in however much money they are going to need to provide services like schools, hospitals, roads, police etc.
So how exactly can you use taxes to collect all the revenue you need but then also use them to manipulate the currency? Taxes are only just paying for all the services, but the economy is stalling, unemployment is rising. Usually this is where interest rates are lowered and investment is encouraged to create new jobs. But what happens in your world? You lower taxes even more so the government can’t afford to run the schools or hospitals?
You don’t have the first idea about why monetary policy exists or what the fed even do. Why interest rates need to move up and down. You don’t have any idea at all.
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:48:28
Of course people have to spend to live.
But what is better for an economy? One where people are encouraged to invest in new business and buy property or other investments? Or one where we horde as much cash as we can and spend as little as we can. Not many jobs or opportunities to make money in a world like that.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:28:40
Hahaha that wait is one of the exact reasons it will fail.
Just because it's trending right now means nothing.. is the queue and volatile price a good thing for a currency? Not at all. If I'm a business and accept payment in Bitcoin, there is no guarantee that $10k I receive today isn't going to be worth $2k tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:03:37
That’s the thing it’s not about chest beating and being superior. It’s about people sitting back and looking at both systems equally without greed or anything else clouding your judgement.
For me when bitcoin started taking off I researched it and learned about it and how it compares to our current economy. If it was going to be good I wanted in... but after reading enough I realised that expecting bitcoin to replace the dollar is like building a new version of notepad and expecting it to replace MS Office. Most people here are comparing notepad to word and saying hey look notepad is easier and more efficient! But they are completely ignoring all the other aspects to the system.
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:42:25
So simple when you ignore all the practicalities!!
Yeah being robbed is just like a car crash just call up your insurance company and sort it out!
Do you have any idea of the costs it takes to have people walking the beat and driving around all the time? People investigating cases all the time, full coverage of the entire city and every suburb. Air support, weapons, holding cells, forensics, databases, sketch artists etc etc etc.
Your monthly security bill would be 100 times more than your power bill. You’d also have no choice of providers (each provider wouldn’t split themselves across the entire state, they’d be location based).
And that’s the thing. If there was any way it could be privatised and government could make money from it the US gov would’ve done it already! They’ve done it with hospitals and prisons already. The rest of the world sees that as crazy because healthcare and justice are costs everyone needs to endure, so why introduce extra costs where a private company can make a profit? Why not have the government provide the service with almost no profit and your citizens have cheaper healthcare and security costs they can spend on other things.
You obviously don’t seem to understand your concept is already in place. Government has privatised the things it thinks can be run at a profit and other things remain public where the cost would be too great (eg. Schooling).
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:31:43
Hahahaha love to hear where the money for all this would come from.
Where would business get their money from? How would people be building houses without home loans? Bitcoin would restrict the money available in the system so much the economy would go nowhere.
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:23:04
Lol sure thing mate. Truth is most newbies got in during the run from 10k-20k and are fucked.
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:43:10
Plenty of people know what the central bank does with the money. It’s just not your job so you don’t know.
You can complain about boom and bust cycles but you currently sit back enjoying Netflix, Uber, Facebook, Reddit on your iPhone or Android all of which wouldn’t be possible without this system.
Growing it naturally? Yeah that’d be great, the most technologically advanced nations today would be at the level that Indonesia is at... sure it works and lots of people have jobs and functioning society, but there’s no Microsoft, apple, General Motors, Tesla coming out of that country. If everything was naturally grown you’d be born in the 40s and by the time you were 60 the world would’ve advanced as if it was now the 50s.
Slow and steady, natural growth sounds good from your comfy position. But in reality we would be way behind where we are as a species right now.
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:25:52
No that’s not how it works.
Typically if a system can be done to generate a profit it is then privatised and sold off to private companies that can make money.
For example we do have some toll roads with tolls. Private company can build that road and charge us a toll for it. But many roads would not make economic sense for a business to build. Same goes for a lot of infrastructure. If private companies rolled out the power lines then you could only get power from one company and they’d charge you a shitload for it!
In the USA many things are privatised such as healthcare and prisons. And what is the result? There are some systems that should not be profitable! Prisons, hospitals, fire departments, police, schools are all in those groups.
Privatising those departments is crazy.
Do you think water should be privatised too? Your house can only get water if the private company decide to lay pipe there... but similar to coax cable it’s maybe not profitable to lay pipe to your house... so no water for you!
Mate government is necessary and good for the community. It’s literally a product of the community. Instead of seeing it as us vs them you have to realise the government is a representation of the people. Though in the US it is kinda fucked up as the gov generally cares more about companies than people.
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:45:31
Lol the funding over the last few days was a 24 hr loan.

The two are not alike at all.
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:59:39
I understand that process is possible but the issue there is that you are limiting potential growth of an economy. Fractional reserve doesn’t require you to wait for the savings to happen again. Any economy can grow at 5-10 faster pace with fractional reserve than without it.
@_date: 2019-09-23 11:22:21
Because the bitcoin blockchain has many issues with it. Why would anyone want to jump into a chain that has so many problems and is so slow and inefficient? Creating a new chain that works more effectively from day 1 would be the way to go. No point just accepting the limitations of the existing bitcoin chain. The most obvious one being that quantum computers will crack the crypto in less than 2 years so the whole thing needs to change.
Privately controlled chain addresses many of the issues companies would have with public chains:
-	known/guaranteed performance (not reliant on public who may come and go from the mining pool)
-	known/guaranteed costs (no need to trade coins/tokens with the public and have no idea what they might cost in 3, 6 or 12 months time)
-	support directly from the devs and chain admins (you have any idea what companies will pay for 24/7 support services on their systems)
-	limited chance of potential corruption of problems with the chain by people using it in a non-standard way (eg. People posting pedo images on the chain)
-	reduces overhead of unnecessary redundancy
The list could go on and on. These are all the advantages over a public chain.
In terms of advantages over a standard DB. Well that’s case by case, barely any cases for where a public blockchain is better than a centralised DB have been proven at all. So jury is still out on blockchain in general. But when working in business private is better than public.
BTC is a garbage hedge as the entire market is manipulated by the exchanges and Tether. It also has no intrinsic value so it could drop to $0 at any stage and never recover (especially as the advancements in quantum computing are arriving).
Dude I already answered your question about the digital world. We are in it now. You are such a fucking idiot running this story about ohh things will change! No, when you put on a VR headset and go into a 3D version of the internet. It’s no different from the 2D internet. As I said from day 1 before we had computers to now, equities, having shares in a business is the right asset to hold. If you think neural network technology will take off then shares in the company that will be doing that is what you want to buy!
Just because people might spend 24hrs a day online and inside and send clones out into the world to do their shopping for them. This doesn’t remove the need for government, an economy and a state backed currency.
So in this digital world you describe the currency to own is that of the state you live in. And the assets to own are property and company shares.
Digital scarcity means nothing. Look at the thousands of shitcoins out there, you think they are all special? I can make my own coin tomorrow and only create 50 of them, does that make you want some? This idea is just pure garbage sold to you so you’d buy more bitcoin.

Yup you’re all a bunch of complete idiots who have been brainwashed by other bag holders and now you trust corrupt exchanges instead of legit banks and the banking system. It’s actually fucking hilarious to watch it all happen, all tricked into giving your money away for nothing.
You also don’t seem to realise the state is created by the people for the people. The state enforcing the currency is a good thing because you know your savings won’t suddenly be worth nothing. You are enjoying the fruits of a stable government but you guys are such babies you don’t realise how good you have it.

As I said just because it’s an unsafe place doesn’t mean it doesn’t act like a bank. It’s just shit at keeping itself protected and isn’t regulated.
A mall would be more like a site that allows you to view all the different exchanges and choose what you want where each shop/exchange is independently run and has no real association with each other. If one shop goes out of business it doesn’t impact the profitability of another shop. The fees on each transaction doesn’t go to a single entity and the mall administrators don’t manage all the money and transactions of each of its stores.
Keep telling yourself that but if you really think the crypto world has ditched its reliance on financial institutions you’re delusional. You’ve just moved from Goldman Sachs or Bank of America controlling your money to bitfinex or coinbase.
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:18:53

Dude a currency is state backed. How could bitcoin become state backed? It can’t happen, literally no government would do it or could do it because they need control of their currency.
Regardless of that single point. My post history contains shitloads of reasons why a currency is not possible. As I said you can ask me what if bitcoin turns into a person but I’m not gonna answer questions that make no sense. G’night.
@_date: 2019-09-29 04:30:32

Nope if private can do cheaper and better then conservative governments will sell off that to a private company.
But things like primary schools are a cost the government needs to bare. You don’t make a profit running schools. And we don’t want a society where you make a profit running primary schools as you then create a cycle of inequality where the poor can never be educated.

Ah your post reads like usual bitcoin propaganda but in reality there is no substance behind it.
Who is forcing debt on you? In any banking system it’s your choice to take on debt. The availability of cheap debt is a massive tool that helps the economy grow.
Seems you have no actual changes or thoughts on specific parts of the system you don’t like. You just don’t like bankers making a lot of money. But the exchanges that are processing wash trades and going down for maintenance during price crashes etc, oh you’re totally ok with that!
It’s fkn hilarious watching bitcoin bros run away from the current system because of the big bad bankers. But they run to a system that is being run by much bigger gangsters that are milking you all dry! Bitfinex and tether are the worst but they are all bad!
@_date: 2019-09-22 11:45:22
Why the fuck would any business want to give you free money (in the form of crypto) when you buy shit?

PayID is a project done by all the big banks here. It’s not going anywhere, it’s not being removed etc.
This was not a feature of banking here 10 years ago. But government did a report on what improvements the banking sector needs, instant free transfers was something identifies and the project was started.
You say banks have no incentive to change but it’s simple supply and demand. If there is demand for free international transfers then one bank will start offering that and get all the business. If the demand is there the product will come.


Completely made up. You can apply to be a bank and create a solution or create a venmo or Paypal type product. No one is stopping you it’s all about supply and demand.
Lol energy production. In your mind a plane and a motorbike both using gas to transport 1 passenger are equally efficient! Fact is bitcoin network uses more power than entire countries. It’s not comparable in any way to the resources needed by banks to run their systems. Their power usage would be a drop in the ocean.

But as I say there is no way to get a kid to appreciate what their parents are doing for them unless you kicked them out.

Oh those other great reasons? Like being able to reverse transactions when there is fraud? Like knowing if you die it’s not just lost? 
As I said % doesn’t matter as jewellery or using it as a commodity are both use cases. And as long as the intrinsic use (using as jewellery, in mobile phones etc) people are paying the same market price for it then the value is justified! If people are paying that price for gold at the jewellery store then that’s the market price.
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:50:16
And the lack of control is a bad thing.
We should just have it so that derivatives can be pulled off the market, lost somewhere never to be reclaimed again?
We’d end up with ghost companies where a chunk of the shares are owned by nobody. Currently between 17 and 23 percent of bitcoins have been lost forever I’ve read... what a great system! Oh and don’t forget all the scams and fraud that we can’t have reversed that I’d normally just get visa to reverse for me. Yup sounds like a great system I’m dying to get into!

Wow you have to actually stop and think about this from an objective point of view.
Immutable is not a good thing. You can’t counter fraud.
Permissionless also not really useful in any sense either.
Our current systems are efficient, allow for digital and physical transactions and will cater for fraud and regulations. Also people can’t just look into my bank account and see where my money came from or what I spent it in.
Bitcoin is a step 100yrs backwards, not forwards.

Nope. Cash is enforced by the state.
The state dictates that businesses must accept your money and that businesses must pay their employees in the national currency (unless employee agrees to another arrangement) and it must be up to the minimum wage for that position and that minimum wage is set in the country’s currency.
Fiat has regulated value. No one is forced to accept your bitcoin. Tomorrow it could be worth nothing as no one wants to buy it from you.

That is how you control this. If the guys making decisions do better personally when the country does better then they are incentivised to make decisions that are best for the country and it’s economy. That is how the system works.

Mate my agenda is to add some balance to this sub. Newbies come here to read about bitcoin and see if it's something worth looking into. And what do they get? A load of people who push it on them with propaganda and lies all because that is the only way they can make money. It's the greater fool theory at play. So I'm trying to add a little balance, point out that most people here think they are so great coz they understand how blockchain works, but unfortunately they have no idea how an economy works. They are trying to run a petrol car on diesel and think it's all just gonna work out great!
No I am suggesting that fraud protection and the ability to reverse transactions is more important than immutibility. You have permissions, reporting processes and rules, regulations and punishments to enforce people to act with integrity. And the only place in the world you will read about bankers updating the balance in your bank account is in crypto subreddits. It basically doesn't happen in the real world, not enough to worry about anyway.
Your money can be siezed if you break the law. This is a good thing. Do you want pedophiles to be immune? Would you like drug lords to just send their money all around the world with no fear or being caught? Totally ok for terrorists to go about their business? Your funds can be seized if you are breaking the law, this is good for all of us. These are laws created by society.


Mate you must has misread that. Bitcoin prevents no fraud. Once someone scams you out of your money there is no way of getting it back. This happens all the time all over the world with all different types of currencies. But the one where you know you aren't getting your money back is bitcoin. If you were scammed via credit card or your bank account often you will get the money back.
Cyprus and debt collectors.. Once again you are going to have to explain any link to immutibility.. Though now I am wondering if you even know what that means.
Ohhh and you love privacy so much that you are pushing a system that is a million times worse than the current system... In the hope of getting future fixes that will hopefully make it as good as our existing system.
Yup this is another run of the mill conversation with a bitcoin bull. No idea about the processes the banks and government have in palce to help you protect your money and privacy. Instead willing to give up loads of functionality and security we have now, to take us backwards 100 years to a time of scams and fraud runs rampant. All for what?? So you can feel like you are safe from big bad government LOL Can't wait!!
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:51:53
Mate that’s where inflation vs deflation comes into play.
As I’ve said with a cap on the number of bitcoins it means over time the value would go have to go up, creating a deflationary currency. And I’ve posted lots on here about why that is bad but I’d suggest just googling deflation vs inflation and you’ll see why a deflationary currency is a bad thing.
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:32:56
You’ve never heard of planting trees?
And renewables shows that we can produce resources (energy is a resource) from nothing (almost nothing, solar and wind).
You’ve taken the population thing way too literally never said we need to print more money every time someone is born or anything like that.
 But it makes sense as the population increases costs increase. We need more police, more hospitals, more schools etc.
Sorry cannot be bother replying to the rest of your post. It’s just incoherent rambling. Trying to link monetary supply to resources it just crazy. You’d think you live in a world where animals can’t reproduce and plants don’t grow. Farmers in your mind have a limited number of crops and once they farm them it’s all over. Dude you are so far off the mark it’s not funny.

Foreign exchange rates exist because economic conditions are different in different countries. When one country is booming inflation will be high, when another is lapsing inflation will be low. Conditions are different country to country. If you have one currency across them then you can’t manage the economy. When USA is booming then a coke costs $10 in England. 
The loan example was the new funniest thing I’ve heard all day.
It just goes so well with you constantly referencing Austrian vs Keynesian economics. Sit there trying to talk up these styles and what you know etc and then at the same time you literally jump through hoops to describe the impacts of deflation on savings as a loan. Fucking amazing leap of logic there, still makes no sense but I admire the balls lol
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:19:05
The population one isn’t usually an example id use. But when you have a set number of coins like 21m it’s an example usually people can get their head around.. obviously as the population grows the value of each BTC would have to raise (I was describing as the amount of BTC held by each person on average declines).. anyway this is another way to explain how the currency would suffer deflation.
As for your other parts I can’t comment on your last bit as you seem to mix up investing and saving and I’m not exactly sure the point there.. but the two are very different so don’t wanna make assumption on what you meant.
As for the middle part, there’s a couple of issues one you say you’d still want to buy a house at 30 than 50... but I’d say that would depend on rate of inflation and other factors. But regardless the real point is, how does the situation compare to inflation? And there is no question one has much more incentive than the other.
And then there is the actual rate of deflation. A lot of what we talked about is assuming an acceptable rate of deflation/inflation. But the truth is with such a limited reserve (21m) that doesn’t grow (gold standard had new gold being found all the time, even today new gold is constantly dig up) so the rate of deflation would need to be huge to ensure we never run out of funds. In 100 years or so the rate would be absolutely astronomical.

Mate you haven’t made a single point I’ve ignored or question I’ve avoided. You on the other hand ignore every single point I make.
Here just have one for you, that’ll help you understand...
Why does the government need to print money?
Very simple. That can show you why bitcoin can’t be a currency.
Last way I’ll try to explain this to you mate.
The currency in an economy is like the fuel in an engine. You can’t just switch to diesel fuel and expect the engine to keep running. The economy is a very complicated system, that involves things like interest rates, quantitative easing, printing money, taxes etc... if you understood any of this you’d get why bitcoin wouldn’t work.
But as usual you refuse to learn about the economy as it will ruin your dreams of being rich.
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:14:36
True. Problem is bitcoin bros don’t realise that is massive downside to bitcoin, it’s not a positive at all.
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:45:26
Hahahahaha ok now this is my favourite argument of all.
Because y’all have this conspiracy about bankers and whales and getting control back etc.
So what do you do? Go running to an unregulated market where the exchanges are the new banks. Exchanges are run by people ten times worse than any banking exec and with zero laws stopping them from ripping you off. Same goes for the guys selling their crypto products!
It’s like you decided buying cars from a car salesman was dodgy as he can be misleading and sell you a lemon. So instead what do you do? You start recommending people buy their cars from a guy in Nigeria via email, you’ve got it all in writing this way! No chance he can rip you off! LOL you’re then ripped off a million times worse than any car salesman could’ve.
This fear of the big bad bankers is crazy. It’s all based on nothing, as if some banker is going to update the values in your bank account and not get caught yeah that happens all the time we better get a blockchain!
@_date: 2019-09-20 05:25:20
Rate of deflation is really hard to know. Even when you look at today’s society inflation fluctuates with how the economy is going, it’s not all dependent on the fed printing extra money or anything. So deflation would be partly caused by the currency itself as the value needs to be changed so the government can pay for things and there’d be natural deflation. It is really hard to predict and forecast without working out how the whole thing would work. How do we split 21m bitcoins among the world and all its governments? I’d suspect with such a tiny supply deflation would actually be huge but someone with more knowledge on the topic would be able to give a better prediction.
Yes it’s true you can only invest or save what you didn’t spend. Not really sure how that is relevant. I think the part you are missing is how savings performs vs how investments perform. In an inflationary economy if you just save your money you are effectively losing money as the money slowly becomes worth less due to inflation. This is why inflation encourages investment because you try to get a return from your investment that is higher than inflation and you are making money. But in a deflationary world if you save your money and do nothing with it, it will increase in value. So you are not incentivised to invest. Also if you wait to you buy something down the line it will get ‘cheaper’ effectively as your money is worth more so again people are not encouraged to spend their money which is really bad for the economy.
Yeah and as you say not everyone is gonna spend on investments. But as you also pointed out it comes down to that left over bit after you’re consumables and cost of living. What do you do with your disposable income. One system encourages spending or investing it now. The other system encourages not spending it. Obviously encouraging spending and investment is good for an economy.

There is no need, demand or want for a non-state issued currency.
A state issued currency has value because the government mandates it has value. Businesses must accept it and employers must pay people in it.
Why would anyone want to accept bitcoin? They have to pay their employees and everything else in USD. The only reason anyone holds bitcoin is in the hope it will go up in value and in that case it’s not a currency it’s a commodity like gold. But that’s another whole discussion about bitcoin as a commodity, which has its own issues. Least of all bitcoin is completely useless, it cannot be used for anything else other than trading. Unlike other commodities which have real world uses in manufacturing etc.

Or you can get a Visa card and use it EVERYWHERE you can even use it and get scammed and then get a refund from visa for fraudulent activity. Seriously there isn’t one reason anyone would choose to buy something with BTC instead of visa or fiat. It’s garbage.
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:20:07
Hahaha yeah that’s usually where the bitcoiners go when they have no way to explain how a bitcoin economy could work... call me a shill. Maybe try just reading a bit about how the economy works from an economist instead of a crypto bull.
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:50:26
This is how a real currency works. Governments need to be able to control inflation or stimulate growth or fix other issues. Think of them as your blockchain devs fixing issues in the network if you can’t understand how an actual economy works.
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:00:39
Lol mate the issue is that you try to just see deflationary on its own and you think hmm yeah that can work. For example if the value of the house/investment increases faster than the rate of inflation.
But do you bother at all to compare with the same scenario that has inflation? The incentive is much greater! Of course the size of the incentive is dependant on the rate of inflation/deflation. If deflation was 10%+ then I’d have no incentive to invest, if it’s less than 5% sure I have some incentive if my investment can return 10% or so... but compared to inflationary economy there is always incentive no matter how low the rate of inflation. The incentive just increases more as inflation increases.
As for the loan to yourself you’re gonna have to explain that one it makes zero sense.
You can’t see how bitcoin is worse for wealth inequality? Wow. Ok let’s start by saying right now the inequality is multiples worse than with USD. A huge portion of wealth resides with a very small number of accounts. And that is just considering all the people who have accounts. If you expand that to the world population or even US population then the inequality is insane!
And as no new money will be generated so the next generation can get loans and build their own businesses when they finish uni. They would have to rely on getting their BTC from the existing holders. As the population grows the number of people who hold bitcoin just gets smaller and smaller.
The idea that bitcoin will free the people is so dumb it’s just greed at play. You look at the big picture and everyone is just signing up for a system that is 10 times worse than the current one. Where the value of your money is controlled by whales and dodgy exchange execs who are doing wash trading on their own exchanges.
It’s almost like the working class farmers who convinced themselves that Trump this billionaire fat cat would represent them. It’s just complete insanity. And BTC is the same, people giving up all the protections and systems in place that have been built over decades to create an economy that gives people opportunity and room to grow and instead they signed up to a system controlled by fat cats and exchange execs. The irony is amazing.
@_date: 2019-09-30 07:46:13
The entire economy runs on debt. How do you not realise this? All debt is settled in fiat. And the cycle of debt and repayments and the interest paid all has a huge impact on the economy as a whole. You have any idea why interest rates are moved up and down by the Fed reserve? And yes I read the page and as I stated unless you agree to another contract the legal tender is what will be used to do business. As I said before it’s also how the minimum wage is dictated. Banks issue loans in fiat and the government bonds and treasuries are issued for fiat. All of this exists for a reason, credit to build the world around you. Businesses, buildings and products are all built using credit, loans and funding... this entire system requires a government backed currency and the various systems (like the fed and interest rates) to keep it going. As with most bitcoiners you have no viable alternative that would actually work. You want to tear out the engine of my car and replace it with a Duracell battery, sorry but that ain’t gonna do it. The entire car needs rebuilding.
Oh because people can burn the money then don’t worry no need to try and get it back. Fuck it why do we even have laws, lots of people get away with stealing shit from the shop. No point even having laws about stealing.
That’s how you sound. Nevermind the fact tens of thousands of people are using their credit cards online right now because they know if something goes wrong they’ll still get their money back. 
Dude not sure how you think any of what you have said shows any knowledge of economics. One line answers of ‘nah uh’ aren’t arguments.
You cannot outline a case for bitcoin to replace USD and how an economy would function, how government could build anything or pay its departments, agencies, workers or social security etc. 
There’s no case for why bitcoin could be a commodity or store of value as it has no intrinsic value as I’ve explained gold, silver, oil and other resources do have. You’ve made no viable case at all here mate so nah don’t think I will be going back to hit the books just yet.

It’s like a anti vaxxers saying I wanna know why there is mercury in my vaccination! Well sure if you wanna learn medicine from some scientists I’m sure you can find out... and same goes for central bank spending, spend a day with an economist or a broker and you’ll probably find out.
Nope you didn’t explain the loan thing at all, makes zero sense nobody gives themselves loans.. and as I said please tell me about these great economies you speak of with no central bank?
Tell me what do they use to try and manage inflation/deflation and the amount of money in the economy? You have any idea why we have interest rates, why countries have different exchange rates and why one day the USD might go up and the GBP might go down? Any idea how the GFC could happen but you could still pay $2 for a Coke?
As I said in my case none of those tech companies would exist without huge amounts of debt that would only be possible in our current system.
Sure if you like having the world progress at Amish pace then sure you system might work. But is it an improvement? Hell no.
Lol I also live that you write my comments off as just opinion. And then you state stuff like this:


This is not a great economy. As I’ve said earlier the incentive to invest and grow the economy is so much lower than the current system it would be a big step backwards.
@_date: 2019-09-21 15:18:57
Huh? You are getting very mixed up here.
Do you want bitcoin to be a commodity like gold or a currency?
A commodity has value for trading when it has a combination of scarcity and usefulness. Things don’t have to be that rare to be valuable (eg. I could sell my hair to a wig maker, so my hair has some value) they really just need to have some use and if they are useful then the rarer they are the more valuable. Bitcoin has no use other than trading, whereas gold, silver, oil and other commodities can be traded but also have a use outside of trading that’s why they are valuable.
But really when talking about this digital world I don’t think you actually are talking about commodities or assets. I think you’re talking about a currency for use in this digital world. And as I said, our existing currencies do the job just great and we can stack infinite payment layers on to the existing currencies that suits with technology over time.
@_date: 2019-09-19 23:46:54

@_date: 2019-09-20 00:11:23
Mate because it’s all related.
Can’t make the case for bitcoin as a currency without looking at the impact on the entire economy. Which means looking at what the fed does, fractional banking, using cash etc etc. There are so many components to the economy that are all related. But the easiest example to make to a bitcoin bull is to ask, what does the fed do? How could bitcoin even work considering the role of the fed in the current economy.
@_date: 2019-09-20 04:45:03
Talk about ignoring points already made... that’s the entirety of your post.
Why would we need another blockchain? Because bitcoin network is slow, inefficient, rigid and there’s only 21m bitcoins that will ever exist. I’ve explained numerous times why bitcoin as a currency will not work with a limited supply and I’ve also explained why bitcoin as a commodity is crazy as it has no intrinsic value. So yeah you’d want another chain because bitcoin is garbage.
A centralised DB is infinitely more efficient that a blockchain. The fact you even claimed blockchain is more efficient shows how little you know about DBs. For all the pros that blockchain has efficiency compared to a centralised DB is not one of them. How could it be efficient when any change needs to be replicated across the entire network?
[ Edit: sorry I see you said centralised blockchain... so to help you understand why that would work you gotta understand why public blockchains are shit for business. As a business how can I project costs into the future? Performance? How can I be sure of support and it won’t change or fork on me? How can I be sure that when another more profitable chain comes along all the miners won’t run for that one? How can I be sure the solution will scale and get fixes when needed? All of these issues are solved with private blockchains. With a central authority.]
Oh you have a crystal ball to tell us what the value would be... not only is that a dumb prediction the truth is the figure you come up with doesn’t matter. The point has been proven it has intrinsic value and bitcoin does not.
As for using for identity I’ll wait and see if that actually goes anywhere. I’d expect that there are much more efficient methods to use. And cheaper too, I expect like 99.9% of corporate blockchain tests and trials it won’t go anywhere. Talk to me again when it has some value, also what price would people pay for this identity token? I suspect no one would pay for it at all so there goes your value.
Wow non-duplicable digital asset. Hey I’ve got some non-duplicable physical assets here, $100,000 per tooth. Interested? Once again that phrase is just another line that means absolutely nothing in reality. No it’s not a really big deal, why don’t you tell me why you think it is. And being the first is important why?  Now there are thousands of coins.
 Nope a simple electrical outage or even an internet outage in your area would fuck up the payment system. In end of days scenario where people are trading gold, silver or even currency. Your usb of bitcoins are useless.
Mining gold, working in offices.. these uses of power actually produce assets or goods and services that contribute to the economy. Your mining rig that sits there running at full power all day will likely produce nothing. Hell most machines on the network are running at max capacity and just wasting that power for no output or result that contributes to society or the economy. Even those that do actually mine some bitcoin are producing something with zero intrinsic value. The entire network is wasting huge amounts of power for nothing. If the network stopped tomorrow it would actually be a benefit for society and the world.
Don’t you understand with redundancy there is a point where it becomes a waste. Say for example my company has a customer database and I run log shipping and have a handful of nodes replicating it across a few locations. I then run back ups every night. Now I could replicate to 10 machines or 100 machines or 1000 machines if I wanted to but there comes a point where the efficiency and costs don’t make sense. That’s the case with the bitcoin network, 99% of the nodes are a total waste and pushing out to every node makes the entire system extremely slow, costly and inefficient.
As I said mate you’re the one that has ignored every point I’ve listed. I’ve explained intrinsic value and why bitcoin has none. I’ve explained why the blockchain is inefficient and bitcoin would be useless as a currency or commodity.
If you could actually drop the bags you’re holding and see it objectively you’d know I’m right. But that means you won’t be a bitcoin millionaire so of course you aren’t gonna listen to reason.
@_date: 2019-09-20 07:06:26
Wow talk about ignoring points let’s just cover them all here..
-	second layer solution, so you’re admitting bitcoin is currently no good for use as a commodity or currency. You’re already giving up on the existing solution, not sure why the discussion doesn’t just end here.
-	I did misread your post originally and replied about centralised DB. I’ve since made an edit and discussed centralised/private blockchains.
-	don’t see the bitcoin solution providing any advantages over other identity systems at some point you still need to go through the verification process. As I said no one would pay for it so there’s no intrinsic value.
-	you claim you have established intrinsic value for bitcoin. But you seem to have ignored everything I said. Intrinsic value is what it’s worth if people aren’t trading it as an asset/commodity. Bitcoin has no other purpose than trading as an asset/currency. It does nothing else. Gold has other uses as I’ve listed many times, people buy it for these uses. That is intrinsic value. You are just plain wrong here.
-	your whole spiel about digital stuff is just pure garbage and propaganda. None of it means anything. Currently I can access my money via tapping my card at hundreds of locations within walking distance of me. I can buy stuff online from millions of vendors instantly. I can lend my friend some cash too as they don’t have a bank account. I can obtain my cash at thousands of atms around the country. My money is digital when I need it and physical when I need it. Bitcoin only has the digital side. And it’s payment/ledger system is crazy inefficient. By the way it’s 10 years old, it’s not new buddy. Any other tech that’s 10 years old has been put to use and in the mainstream now. Bitcoin, nope. 
-	you just mentioned charge on your phone, back up battery etc... can’t you admit that cash is better in these scenarios? If I’m at a football stadium buying a drink and the network is congested, surely buying via cash is faster and easier. How can you dispute that at all? So you admit in end of days scenario your bitcoin is worthless, there goes your intrinsic value argument mate.
-	bitcoin is not critical part of the economy. It could go to zero tmrw and the world would feel zero impact. The market cap is total fallacy and bullshit as there’s not that demand to fulfill it. Truth is 80% or more of the coins would’ve been obtained when the price was less than $1. So referring to the market cap is totally misleading and has nothing to do with its place in society.
-	as I’ve pointed out plenty of times it has no intrinsic value. You can talk about ledgers and immutable database all you like and this huge network of computers wasting power achieving nothing. As I said intrinsic value is what it’s worth when it’s not being traded as commodity or asset. And we have established (you even admitted in end of days scenario) it’s worthless, case closed.
-	so infinite redundancy is your goal? You think if the network had 1m nodes that’s good and 5m nodes is even better and 6bn nodes would be even better? Wow the only thing that level of redundancy achieves is wasting power. As I said before there is the rule of diminishing returns and the bitcoin network has gone way past that. The redundancy is a major problem that causes it to be so slow and inefficient.
-	yup a lot of people would lose some money. But everyone has known it’s complete bullshit from the start that’s why it’s always said don’t spend more than you can afford to lose! Anyone who has bought bitcoin is playing at the casino and when it finally dies there’ll be a lot of losers but society at large won’t even notice.

That’s the result of an extremely slow moving economy and extremely cheap housing and land due to lower demand. As population grows, economy grows, everyone gets richer things get more expensive and there’s more demand for everything.
It’s hilarious to think that you believe all of these changes are to blame on the currency and banking system. Fact is these systems evolved over time because the prior systems were garbage.
Next you’re going to tell me that cars created gay people. Just look at how many gay people are out and open now in the world and compare that to before the ford model T came out. Way less gay people back then. Therefor cars make people gay. That’s what you sound like.
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:07:22
No I don’t.
But you only have to sit back and look at the structure.
Bitcoin is a network of thousands of machines constantly running at full processing power. Even if it was just a normal database or all the coins had been mined already it would still be a big waste of power, but the fact they are constantly mining too is a huge waste. The lotto winner gets his payout while all the other machines just wasted a shit tonne of power. This happens over and over, it’s insane.
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:32:25
Hahahahaha mate we have got here though hundreds of years of civilisation evolving.
Go ahead you tell me how society could work with private courts etc... corruption would rule everything. Jails are already privatised FYI. But even when it comes to schooling you’d like the idea that kids can’t go to school and learn to read unless their parents pay the $100k the company is charging?
If parents had to pay the true cost of schooling barely any of us would’ve gone to school.
I have thought about it mate and it’s a complete shit show. You have zero appreciation for what you have now. You’d likely end up in an end of the world style apocalypse before realising maybe things weren’t so bad.
@_date: 2019-09-30 06:21:55
What?? Go in to a 711 and try to buy a coke with bitcoin. No luck, try buying it with gold, oil, sugar.... nope chances are they will say no. 
Seems you need to take a step backwards and understand what Legal Tender is:
As I said bitcoiners don’t normally understand the economy or government regulations.
Tell me in the bitcoin world how does your government pay for the war planes you are building this year? How about the ones next year? And the ones in the next 10 years and the next 100 years? Now replace war planes with police cars, fire engines, post trucks, military vehicles, government buildings, police stations, schools, hospitals etc etc.
You really don’t have any clue at all how the world around you has been built or how any of it works.
You have any idea what the Fed reserve does? Any idea why they announce interest rates will go up or down and why they move them?? No of course you don’t!
You literally see a car filling up with fuel and you’re like why can’t I fill it up with electricity! But you are completely ignorant as to how the car runs or how it’s been built or why it works. You just see car needs gas, hmm how about I give it electricity!
And money seized by the government. I was making a point. Do you think if someone robbed your local bank of $100m then they should just be able to keep that money?? What about when someone steals your credit card number and uses it online? You’d prefer if we can’t get refunds right? Too bad you lost your money! Sucks to be you.... nah mate current situation where we get our money back and have refunds or chargebacks processed through the bank to get our money back from scammers is a good thing. In your world everyone would just be dying SFYL all the time as once you’re scammed it’s too late. Wow what a great world to live in!
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:37:32
As I said it’s supply and demand.
I dunno what your banks are like in the US but here in Aus I can send my mates money for free and it arrives instantly using payid (a technology all our banks are using).
So for large international transfers western union would be the go.
If there is a lot of demand for better system for international payments I’m sure someone will create one but all system have costs associated to them. The cost of the bitcoin network is fucking insane. The amount of power it is drawing to contribute almost nothing to society is completely crazy.
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:09:02
Surprised you don’t have one that says ‘the earth is flat’ too.
@_date: 2019-09-18 21:54:41
Lol you didn’t explain how a system can work without it. You just bitched on about crap that you don’t understand.
Complaining about inflation? Any idea what happens to an economy that has no inflation or actually a deflationary currency? It’s a bad thing, people are not encouraged to spend money or invest it, the country goes nowhere.
You personally don’t have any debt... but look around the country at every house and every building you see. Pretty much every single one of those was built via debt provided by a bank. Even after building as houses are bought and sold it’s all provided via bank loans. Without them people would be much further enslaved only able to afford to rent with no chance to ever own anything!
An economy needs to be able to print money out of thin air. If we used bitcoin then how would the government pay for schools, roads, hospitals? Imagine how much money would need to be spent maintaining roads over the next 100 years.. that is an expense that never goes away that you need to fund forever (building hospitals and schools are similar but roads being repaired is easier to understand)... with a fixed amount of bitcoins how could the government be able to fund road repairs (and schools, hospitals, police stations etc) for the next 10, 100, 1000 years?
You have zero understanding how an economy works. That’s why you fail to see why a bitcoin based economy would never work. That basically goes for almost the entire bitcoin community. In reality bitcoins only hope would be more like a safe haven asset like gold rather than a currency. But that has its own set of issues I won’t go into.
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:49:28
Nope not true.
That’s like saying the thing that caused 911 was a plane blowing up. I explained it was a terrorist plot but you say nah terrorists can’t fly into buildings they need a plan for that.
As I said if the bonds were rated correctly and not treated as AAA then the GFC would never have happened. Are you saying that statement is wrong?
@_date: 2019-09-21 07:57:26

Thanks for calling yourself out on that. As I said using that as an example of failure is like using the nazis as an example of failure. It’s rare and so out of place it’s a dumb example to use. Thanks for agreeing with me.
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:24:27
That’s the thing mate.
You label anything you don’t like that has some government involvement as socialism.
We’re talking about the fed reserve doing its best to assist the economy and you call it socialism. But these major social systems that are much more complex aren’t socialism. I can tell you that’s not what Fox News will be saying when Bernie’s health care plan comes up.
Just like any other person in the US you use the term to attack anything you don’t like. Who says there is no accountability? You read all the stories about the money printing this week? Mate you don’t have a clue and I’m not American btw.
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:30:29
Lol thats not how printing works.
They don’t just print it put it into their own savings account and move on.
You have no clue what you are talking about. None of your post makes any sense either ‘just lazy people left without money’. You don’t have a clue at all mate.
Fact is government needs money to pay for shit you use like roads and schools etc.. and generally taxes don’t cover it all. So unless you don’t want an education or you want dirt roads money is needed... but that’s the simplest explanation in reality money needs to be printed for a lot of different uses, like the 24hr loans issued the last few days. But I can tell you’re too simple to understand how any of that works, why adding money to a system may be needed in certain times and taking money from the system (increase interest rates) may be needed at other times. In your mind the economy is about as complicated as a game of monopoly. You really have no idea.
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:17:13
Hahaha wow you’re taking another complete different turn once all your other avenues have been closed off.
Must admit this is a new bold approach cotton. But once again it’s useless. Bitcoin is a record in a database at its core that’s all it is. And as it’s not backed by any state or any actual use it’s worthless simple as that.
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:30:15

@_date: 2019-09-29 22:36:57


A government created by the people for the people. Seems you are saying no point in having laws or government yup great argument there. As I’ve said before ask all your friends and family how many times each of them have had a charge reversed or cancelled due to fraud? Their CC number being used for something they didn’t buy or just someone scamming them and the bank reversing the charge. This is fair seizure! This happens all the time, someone goes on holiday card gets used fraudulently. Our current system means you can get the money back!! Plus when big wigs try to avoid paying taxes or criminals try to run with money thueyve stolen via ponzi scheme we can get it back. Only time your money would be seized is if you are a criminal. ‘Trustless’ money is not a good thing, I like being able to use my credit card everywhere and know that if this company scams me and doesn’t send me my purchase visa will just reverse the charge. Happens thousands of times every day around the world.


Completely untrue, and based on nothing. The reason we are using the current system is that it is the most efficient to create a functional economy that can grow fast and give people opportunities. An economy on bitcoin would not grow at all. We would go backwards.


Wow what a lot of garbage. Websites go down for maintenance when people want to take them down, nothing to do with the system. The system can keep them up 24/7, same with ATMs. None of your points have anything to do with bitcoin or blockchain being a better system. Now for some reason you are saying if Joe decides to close his shop early it’s a bad thing for fiat? Opening times got nothing to do with it. The system and fiat still runs all the time, you can buy shit on amazon at 4am every day if you wanted to. Man you really just start ranting about shit that makes zero sense ‘security is basic because people can refund money’ yeah mate you didn’t make a single point about why bitcoin is any good. As I mentioned in my example there are a hundred reasons to use fiat, it’s fast, it’s easy, it’s cheap, accepted by everyone and I can give it to you digital or physically. 


And that’s your response? I literally used that example because I knew you’d like to think of bitcoin as futuristic like electric cars. But that’s about all your brain can handle. Duhhhh bitcoin is like Tesla derrrr... just ignore the actual point being made that you can’t just feed electricity to a fuel car and suddenly it becomes electric. The entire system is design around burning fuel. That’s what you don’t get. The economy couldn’t run on a currency like bitcoin. But you don’t understand the first thing about the economy.
Funny you mentioned income tax with Monaco... you didn’t say they survive without Tax. You specifically said ‘income’ tax hmm I wonder why that is.
Oh and this wonderful world where you have finally accepted a government would still need to exist and spend money on things. I never really said defence spending but anyway thats the only expense you understand so let’s go with that... now how exactly is this government going to create and spend trillions of dollars when there’s a limited number of bitcoins? How do we have enough money for government spending for the next 100 years?
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:13:01
Immutability: and current systems have problems with this how? When was the last time your bank balance changed suddenly because some bank changed your account value and ripped you off and you couldn’t call the authorities on them?
Hard money: finite amount is good because what? It’s rarer than gold yes, so are my teeth. Would you like to buy them for $5m each? Trust me there are only 30 in existence and they haven’t been mined yet so get in first just send me $5m for the first one!
Control: so the idea that your entire life savings can be lost when you lose your wallet is the control you’re after right? No insurance, no back up, no one that will refund your money when you get scammed or hacked. Yeah independence is amazing, you’ll be broke all on your own without any help from anyone? Remind me again how this is better than the current system? Where I can withdraw my money anywhere in the world I go without having to worry about ever losing it.
Inflation resistance: hahaha that’s an amazing one. Instead of your wages going up a coupe of percent each year and earning a few percent on your money in the bank basically negating any inflation I’d much rather have my money be worth whatever the idiot down the road thinks it’s worth. Right now my bitcoin is worth less than 50% of what it was in December, how awesome! It’s only gone down about 30% in the last week or so, here’s hoping my rent has also gone down 30%! No it hasn’t? It just went up 50% hmmm maybe I’m fucked.
@_date: 2019-09-28 23:32:24
Perfectly sums up this sub and 90% of the bitcoin community in general. We don’t understand economics at all but we’re going to replace the entire economy with one run on bitcoin!

@_date: 2019-09-23 10:10:13
Hahaha ahh this bitcoin theory that state backed currencies are only recent things it’s like I was gonna build a car but the design is to use horses. I’m like what are you doing? Use an engine, it’s way more efficient and faster! And you’re like mate engines are a recent thing, look at the history!
Humans evolve, state backed currency is the evolution because that is what was needed. Without state backed currency people didn’t have the faith in the currency that was required and there are competing currencies etc. Humanity has worked out the right way to do it Is with a state backed currency.
You are literally pushing to take society back 100 years.
Optional fraud protection is a bad thing. You know how people try to scam others using PayPal and then reversing transactions etc? Yeah leaving room for fraud is not good because the exact guys who want to scam you aren’t gonna let you use the method that has fraud protection.
But in reality the issue with you talking about second layers now is that the design you have already fails compared to the current system. Generally when coming out with a new system is improves completely on the old system and any issues to be resolved are ones that any system would have. You don’t upgrade to a system that is worse than the current one and then hope for patches to catch up to where we were already.
Bitcoin base layer is garbage. It has no fraud protection, it’s extremely slow, it’s expensive, it’s performance cannot be relied upon because resources and performance are due to people who have no contractual commitment to keep servicing you. And best of all based on quantum computing advances right now bitcoin is due to be cracked within 2 years making it useless without a complete overhaul.
All these issues and we haven’t even started using it at scale. We already know it doesn’t scale up, but the point is once a system actually takes on a big load is when it’s issues are usually identified. Bitcoin already has all these problems before scaling!
Essentially you are struggling to make a case that Bitcoin could handle the most simple of transactions at scale. Never mind replacing the dollar and the multitude of systems currently integrated with it. And the fact you can’t even handle physical offline transactions properly aka cash.
And then aside from all of that is the actual economy. Things like printing money, interest rates, the Fed, taxation, preventing money laundering and drug trafficking etc etc.
It’s not even capable at the lowest level, nevermind actually replacing and being better than current systems. Oh and then there’s the complete waste of power! All of this shitty system and it uses the power of entire countries! It has no hope.
@_date: 2019-09-19 23:08:00
Mate you don’t get it.
It’s hilarious that we started off with a house for sale for $200k and I point out that due to deflation people are not incentivised to invest in property the same way as when inflation is involved.
Your answer? Oh the owner will just take 100k instead! Sure thing! Lol your logic makes no sense at all.
Your hot dog example is useless. Same price in 10 years is no inflation or deflation and a hot dog is not an asset that can gain value or be used to make money like a house or property.
Mate you are so lost just give it up.
@_date: 2019-09-30 00:04:15
Mate saying bitcoiners don’t understand the economy is like saying anti-vaxxers don’t understand medicine or science.
Now you can show me a doctor or a scientist that is an anti vaxxer but my point is still valid.
I am still trying to find any bitcoiner who can make an intelligent case as to why bitcoin would work as a currency or a commodity/store of value. But to date every single one doesn’t understand the economy or intrinsic value. Every single debate ends up where they say oh you don’t get it and you don’t want to be rich!
But I’m here ready for anyone to tell me how it possibly could hold value as a store of value or how it could possibly function as a currency and the fed reserve could still actually do its job.
And I think there are many places you can get out of the echo chamber. Go to or finance and see what they think about crypto or bitcoin... try reading what buffet, gates, bezos think about it... try reading what people with a lifetime in banking, economics think about it.
Then take some concepts and think about it yourself. Why do we print money? Why can’t we use a currency with limited supply what problems would that cause the government? Etc etc. When asking these questions don’t just get answers from a bitcoiner but get an answer from an outsider and compare it to the bitcoiner answer to see which is more logical etc
@_date: 2019-09-21 15:52:47
Of course not. I’ve never bought any crypto. Loads of mates tried to talk me into it but I tried explaining to them how dumb all this money from thin air that is completely useless is.
Now their coins are worth fuck all or dropped significantly and they’ve lost interest in the scene. Much like you and others here they would just regurgitate the same old lines over and over without actually understanding the basics at all.
What you need to learn is that crypto subreddits have been a propaganda machine. Where they just hype and pump the prices and would ban anyone who is negative. Like Trump labelling anything he doesn’t like as Fake News, you’d get labelled FUD and banned from crypto subs when just trying to discuss it. Why? Because they only care about the price going up. They only want positive people who will push it. If they truly believed in it and knew it was the future they’d invite discussion and criticism and make and prove their points.
But they didn’t want to do that. Because they know as with every conversation I have with any crypto person it always ends up the same way. They run out of arguments and they have no answers at all for why bitcoin is useful or would have any value or why anyone would want it instead of fiat. And we end up in this exact situation where they say oh I’ll bet you it goes up! Or ohh so you’re secretly holding some and it crashed and now you’re sad? Or don’t you lie making money? Why so negative, just invest and make money man! All of it just hiding the fact they don’t understand the economy or commodities and they’ve been talked into believing it all. Slowly people are now waking up and realising it was all just a fad and greed, but will take a while for the slower ones to finally see they’ve been duped.
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:06:20

Yup sitting here on my smartphone posting on reddit while waiting for my Uber eats to arrive, yeah society sure is getting dumber! I just wonder what kind of phones they must’ve had back a 1000 years ago when everyone was so smart!
Love just spilling out crap lines like ‘education not schooling’ and what is education exactly?
Doesn’t matter what you want to teach them. Whether you wanna teach them to be nazis, or you wanna teach them survive skills or you teach them the current curriculum that is ‘churning out us dumb fucks’ the most efficient way to educate people is to teach them in classes, on groups. In an organised setting with all the tools and recourses on hand. A school. Or you might call an education centre.
Bitcoin has nothing to do with capitalism vs socialism. You’re just another fool who has been brainwashed to label anything you don’t like as socialism. You don’t realise that every develop nation in the world has ‘socialised’ healthcare because it is the best option. There are some things that are cheaper and more effective when done in bulk than individually. But you’re too paranoid about big bad socialism to actually understand basic economics.
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:24:12

No I haven’t replied to anyone in this thread about bad replies because they are all answering your question but then also adding in some extra ‘information’ here and there.
Mate, was only trying to give a newbie some perspective. Try to suggest you do a bit more research before buying in. Go ahead spend you money mate makes no difference to me. I just spotted someone here that might help to know that if you have gathered your info about bitcoin in these subreddits and the crypto community then just try looking elsewhere too. I even suggested a few things to ask yourself before buying in.
But seems you’re like the rest of the guys here.. us vs them!! Get lost don’t wanna discuss anything! Mate go right ahead, you’re like an anti vaxxer after I’ve advised they just check their facts with a doctor. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:58:39
You think foreign exchange markets just pull the numbers out of thin air mate?? Nah that’s bitcoin you’re thinking of. All the factors I described are just some of the things that go into determining the value of a currency and how it moves... good jobs report, good inflation numbers, good GDP numbers all these have impact on the value of your currency. Along with the current interest rates, though those interest rates are a function of how the economy is running too.
The term loan might’ve been useful for them to teach you how deflation works. But it’s completely ridiculous to use in real world discussion.
Hahahahaha ahh buddy no need to worry about my lack of knowledge here. You’re the one fighting against government and for a deflationary currency. I’m totally fine here lol
@_date: 2019-09-21 23:23:29
Yes I did...


A commodity/asset? That has no intrinsic value but people still trade it is quite possible. Not worried about that at all will have no impact on me
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:23:07
Yeah your assumptions would likely be wrong.
Also I’d assume you’ve read all the same shit the crypto guys tell each other to read. It’s the usual propaganda bundle. Shit like Austrian vs kenseyian, origins of money, definition of intrinsic value (that is not the real definition but the one crypto bros tell you to believe), break down of how blockchain works, breakdown to why permissionless and distributed DBs are so great and unhackable. Just all the usual garbage.
But I’ll bet none of it actually focus on real world 21st century economics such as:
-	what does the Fed do? Why is it important to financial stability of the country
-	why does a government need to print money
-	why do we have interest rates go up and down and what impact it has on the economy, why is it done
-	why is there quantitative easing (not why it’s bad but why our society and government is using it, why is it necessary)
-	why there are exchange rates between currencies of different countries and what impacts those exchanges rates.
-	how taxation works and why it’s important
-	why tracking of large movements of cash is a good thing for society in stopping human trafficking, fraud, terrorism, drug trafficking, tax evasion etc
-	why the ability to refund and reverse transactions is so important
-	why the ability to transact cash in physical form when offline or out of power is important
-	why gold has intrinsic value and bitcoin has none
-	how something gets intrinsic value (not the crypto bros definition but a real economics definition)
-	why the bitcoin blockchain is a huge waste of power and extremely inefficient, expensive and slow compared to existing systems
-	the origins of the term FUD and why it’s a propaganda term to prevent subjects from listening to other sources of information (similar to how Trump says Fake News)
I could keep going on but I’m sure it’s a waste of time. Generally most people in here are bag holding so talking sense to them is useless. While you think you’re still holding a lotto ticket that might make you rich you will never listen to reason.

Ok first up:


Literally makes zero sense at all. As a currency it is garbage, it’s slow, inefficient, expensive to use, limited to online/electronic use, lacks privacy and is not supported by any state. It is garbage as a currency.


Wow it’s not often I see someone contradict themselves in a single sentence. Industrial usage is intrinsic value. When you are not trading it as a commodity, then it is can be used for something and it’s very good at that thing. That is literally intrinsic value.
Go and read a book about economics please.
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:55:12
Lol yeah hard to face reality isn’t. People are having kids, better to just ignore reality I guess!
@_date: 2019-09-19 06:53:51
No you really don’t get this.
Incentive is the same? No it isn’t.
In inflationary economy, I buy a house for $200k in 10 years it might be worth $350k.
In deflationary economy I buy a house for $200k I’m 10 years it might be worth $150k.
So inflationary economy encourages me to invest. Deflationary encourages me to keep my money and not invest at all
The reason people don’t just leave their money in bank account accruing interest is because generally interest is only just above inflation (right now it’s actually below inflation) so leaving your money in an account getting interest it’s actually going backwards. So you are incentivised to invest it somewhere where it will grow over time and that investment also helps grow the economy.
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:45:51
Eh sorry you’re too stubborn and brainwashed to even look into inflation vs deflation and realise the bitcoin story is a fantasy sold by charlatans who have no idea how an economy works or why we have interest rates, or exchange rates between countries.

Giving me a loan just for saving. Hmmm what does that do to the economy? I’ve just locked up X number of coins, doing nothin while I hold them. How is the economy going to grow? How does that create jobs or businesses? It doesn’t.
You really need to google inflation vs deflation to understand why inflation is actually a good thing that encourages an economy to grow and great jobs and opportunities.

It’s about efficiency...
Is it efficient for every household to have a parent who stays home and teaches the kid everything they need to know. Or is it more efficient for one parent to be a teacher and 30 kids go and learn from that teacher while all the other parents can go and work and contribute to the economy?
This is why public services exist. It makes sense to pool resources together and do it more efficiently. Instead of every person having their own personal body guard we have a police force. This is how society works, we’ve evolved to this point over hundreds of years and the people in this sub want to take us back to the Stone Age.

Oh sorry my man I am replying to about 10 different crypto bulls at the moment. Just had someone raise Venezuela on me so the usual response to that is hitler. To me they are both one off examples to be ignored.
Edit: oh wait I was replying to a Venezuela post. So yeah to me the Hitler comparison is apt, you called me out for it but my points are as relevant.

Why would any business want to do this?
It would ruin their business.
Shop A: Sells a bottle of coke for $2
Shop B: Sells the same bottle of coke for $2.20 but you get back 20c worth of bitcoin
I know which shop everyone is going to.
People don’t want to ruin their business just to help make bitcoin popular. Wow talk about stupid ideas I think you take the cake here mate.

Generally you just don’t know what you’re going to need to spend on etc.. there are times when a government has a surplus as things turned out better than expected but that is not often.
As I say who is going to win an election or maintain power if they come in and say taxes are going up to pay for everything? Much better to be like Trump and cut taxes for everyone (but the rich especially) as people care about cash in their pocket and don’t care so much about a big government deficit.
Edit: but also inflation is desirable. It encourages you to spend and invest. If there was no inflation you’d just horde your money for a rainy day. But due to inflation holding it will mean it loses money so you are encouraged to invest in businesses or deposit and get interest or buy an investment property etc that will increase in value... this encouragement to spend is what creates opportunity and more and more jobs in the economy.
Instead of an economy that is just feeding everyone every day. We have construction and new businesses etc because money is being spent and invested.

You asked what if it’s a currency. That’s like asking me what if you are a dog. Well talking dogs don’t exist so it’s not possible.
If you know what a currency is then you’d know your question made no sense. So I answered it the best way I can by saying commodity yes, currency no.
If you’d like to learn more about how useless bitcoin is feel free to read my post history you’ll find a shitload of material in there.

So answer the question then. If it’s a private institution who owns it?
Check the website mate, it ends in .gov
Or maybe this will help you


It’s independent but it is a tool of the government. Created by the government. You are an idiot.
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:49:18
Fuck me seriously dude you don’t have a clue.
Ok here it is straight from Wikipedia it’s basically a bank owned by the government which has employees/members/appointments from private banks in it. As well as appointments from the government. Some banking appointments are voted by banks in that region. But instead of going into the details of the entire structure this part basically sums it up for you...




Yeah mate sure it’s privately owned but all profits and proceeds go to the government LOL you don’t have a fucking clue.

@_date: 2019-09-20 08:46:18
Lolll another sucker just repeating the same old lines that all mean nothing.
Let’s break them down for fun..
-	Be your own fucking bank
Why would you want to? Banks have amazing security, don’t have to worry about some guy coming around to my house with a baseball bat. Banks let you reverse transactions. Banks will provide loans and exchanges to other currencies. Banks will keep your money secure and then let you use it or withdraw it from tens of thousands of locations, maybe even hundreds of thousands of locations. I can land in any country in the world, pull out my bank card or credit card and I’m good. Banks actually provide amazing services, y’all are just salty that they make a profit while doing it.
-	decentralize control over money
Why is this a good thing? Centralised banks have loads of benefits I just listed. Decentralising it just adds layers of redundancy that is unnecessary and slows everything down. The system runs like shit.
-	therefore control over the world
You’re gonna have to explain that one. Governments controlling the supply of money is actually a good thing. I suspect you have no idea what the federal reserve does or why it’s a good thing. Go and read about how things were before the fed and why it was brought in.
-	an immutable ledger that negates a large portion of corruption potential.
That’s the idea. But have you ever had your bank balance changed by someone at the bank? Know anyone who has? No. You’re imagining a problem that doesn’t exist. And the solution you’re using creates new potential for fraud. Where anyone who scams me will get away with it. There’s no way to reverse it. What is more important? Ask 100 people how many of them have got charges reversed or cancelled by their bank because of fraud and then ask them how many of them had their bank balances changed by dodgy bankers.
There’s your answer. You’re creating a worse system.
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:47:32
Eh I think ‘great’ might be an overstatement.
I think it could find uses. But it would be in a closed regulated environment where costs, resources and performance are all known and can be relied upon. But in most cases a centralised DB will do the job.
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:16:40
As I said the market gets it numbers from where? Ohhh I see you’ve spent so much time with crypto you don’t understand that movements in markets relate to actual news and events. For example Australia cuts its interest rate today and the Aussie dollar falls in value. Obviously you don’t get any of this. It’s just a market and does market things LOL
What? You literally used the term loan to try and explain how money can increase in value over time in a deflationary environment. And now you wanna try pick me apart? Go fuck yourself you idiot.
Oh the government doesn’t create money? Ok who does then? A private corporation? Who owns that corporation? No one, it’s the fed, owned by the country and labelled as an instrument of the government.

Unknown entity? Who says they are unknown.
They are very well known and held to account for their decisions.
Hate to imagine the state of your country if they weren’t there. Would you just have 5% interest rates all the time?? Regardless if it’s good times or bad times, interest rates are always 5%? They are doing so much to make sure the economy is running well that you have no appreciation for.

Lollll good effort there mate.. points for trying.
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:51:45
Sorry what do volumes have to do with anything I was talking about?
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:05:29
Mate that’s exactly my point.
They know about bitcoin but they know nothing about an economy. So when they try to talk about how it could act as a currency or a store of value they have zero idea what they are talking about.
It’s the same in the way Mothers think they know their kids and how their kids work, that’s why they know vaccines make them sick! No matter what you say they won’t believe you that it’s the science and the medicine that says otherwise.
It’s exactly the same here. Guys excited about the blockchain tech. Looking for a use. But it does not fit into a functional economy. As a currency a limited supply and deflation doesn’t work. As a store of value not having any intrinsic value doesn’t work.
But there are way more factors than that such as taxation, fraud control, the Fed reserve, interest rates etc etc.
Anyone who talks about bitcoin just ignores all of these. It’s like someone saying they are going to have an electric car but just swap the fuel for electricity. It doesn’t work, you need to change the entire system. And these guys who push bitcoin have no idea how monetary systems work and how the economy works.
Edit: dude hasn’t backfired on me at all. I’ve been the only one of my mates who managed to stay out of it. Go ahead check my post history. As far back as you want to go. While you are there you might learn a bit more about why bitcoin is worthless and why all the big tech guys don’t believe in it.
Mothers don’t know medicine, bitcoiners don’t know economics.
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:28:48
That’s like saying fiat is MasterCard and PayPal and cash and digital records at the bank and cheques...  the method used to transfer it or store it is not the actual thing being traded that has been assigned value.
And no you can’t trade bitcoin with anyone at any time. If I visit my mum I can’t just give her a bitcoin, there a whole set up process and we’d need to get online etc.
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:39:57
Then it is worthless. It remains as it does now, no one using it for anything and people holding it hoping it goes up in value. But when people realise it doesn’t have the intrinsic value of gold and during a recession or hard times it drops to zero, it will just be forgotten about like every other shitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-19 14:57:45
What you don’t realise is that when times are tough the government needs a way to stimulate the economy.
When times are good they need a way to tamp down the economy.
Interest rates are useful for small adjustments, they have other tools like QE and printing money for larger Adjustments or other moves.
Just look at why the Fed was created. The economy was constantly in crisis every year or two. Fed reserve was born from necessity. Remove it and we’d back to the shit times.
@_date: 2019-09-19 23:35:57
Hahaha yeah sure thing mate. The solution to selling a house is you drop your price by 50%. Fuck off man you haven’t spent a single minute in an econ lecture.. if you did you’d know something about interest rates, monetary policy, fed reserve and why bitcoin can’t replace or replicate all those measures that keep the economy running.
@_date: 2019-09-19 01:42:16
And this is why BTC doesn’t work.
What happens if government has no controls to stimulate bad economies and tamper down booming ones? It all goes to shit.
A world where governments can’t build infrastructure, public services can’t function and people can’t even own or build their own homes. The idea of BTC as a currency would take us backwards hundreds of years.
@_date: 2019-09-24 03:09:27
Why would you lie? Because immutability is a major upside to bitcoin that is pushed on the sub. As with everyone here I expect it’s in your interest to push that. When in reality problems caused by a lack of immutability is not an issue 99.9% of people ever have to deal with. In reality having an immutable ledger makes refunds and fraud protection that much harder. And requiring reversals due to fraud is actually an extremely common occurrence.
Debt collectors? What has that got to do with immutability? Cyprus situation also had nothing at all to do with immutability??
As for people not knowing how much you have. Right now that is limited to the banker who has access to thousands of records and probably has no idea who you are. On the blockchain everyone has access to it!! And everyone you ever transacted with knows which account is yours. If you are worried about privacy you’ve really picked the wrong team mate.
Lol theft through inflation. Wow another person who doesn’t actually understand inflation is a good thing for an economy. Just google inflation vs deflation and try reading something not pushed on you by a bitcoin bro.
As for banks, or failed currencies it all comes down to the government and ensuring a stable overall system. You guys prob sit here complaining about Fed bailing out the banks but then bitch that you don’t wanna lose your money when they go under too. Can’t have it both ways.
The Fed and the government does so much work to protect the economy but you have no idea about any of it.
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:27:01
Compared to visa, MasterCard, payid, PayPal, cash.
You know what in my 38 years I haven’t had to transfer over $10k internationally and I can tell you that 99.9% of my friends haven’t either. If there was demand for it and a real issue a solution would be released in the free market. But all the hassle of bitcoin/blockchain with 1 single upside that has almost no demand is not a case. Hell I suspect if I ran the numbers it’s probably turn out cheaper and faster to do a western union transfer than myself and the recipient organising BTC.

Ever heard of the saying ‘the market can stay  irrational longer than you can stay solvent’.
The fact the bubble hasn’t fully popped yet doesn’t prove any value. All it shows is some idiots are really slow to learn the lesson.
But in reality I don’t come here to convince you or other brainwashed suckers who have already bought in. Really I’m here so newbies who come to this sub asking for advice about bitcoin will see both sides of the story for once. Normally anyone coming to this sub looking for info just gets flooded w propaganda.
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:38:11
Lol mate I addressed your points head on.
Clearly showed you that thousands of people all around the world are using gold in production or clothing and they are paying the market price for that.
This is intrinsic value. Bitcoin does not have this. It’s that fucking simple mate.
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:39:37
Mate the last thing I will say is you have to think how did we get here.
Same thing goes for most stuff in society. They evolve. We would’ve started with one version of taxation and over time it would be adjusted and tweaked and changed to the version we see today. Same can be said for banking, manufacturing processes, technological advances etc.
The system we have wasn’t just thought up out of nothing as a way to fuck you all.
It was conceived as a solution to a problem. Then overtime it is tweaked and adjusted to ensure it functions correctly.
As I said you have no appreciation for what is being done. From interest rates, to bonds and QE, emergency loans etc... they are sitting there working tirelessly to ensure that the economy continues to run properly.
As I said, remove them and what do you do for interest rates? What do you do during a recession and unemployment is high how do you kick start the economy again get people working etc.
You’re like a child who’s parents have been paying the bills and feeding them all their lives. You’re like fuck this I hate this food and you’re so controlling I wanna do it myself!!! You move out and quickly realise you don’t have the structure or systems in place to set up shelter, provide food, obtain healthcare etc etc.
@_date: 2019-09-21 12:51:46
There you go. You made my point for me perfectly.
The intrinsic value you assign to my feces has nothing to do with the energy required to produce it or the food I ate. As you just stated it is based on how useful that is for someone else. Can they use it for anything? In this case you said yes they can use it for research purposes. Or fuel for power generation. As for pubes I’m sure there’d be a market somewhere too, even if it was to be used as kitty litter or ground up into fibres for something or use them to stuff cushions I dunno... the point is the value is determined by it being used for something when it is not being traded.
That was my entire post. This is why bitcoin has no intrinsic value. If you are not trading it, it has no other purpose or use. It’s that simple, you even just explained it yourself.
Everything you go on about impact on society is just stupid. Because it will have no impact on society. It’s not a currency and no state would ever adopt it as their currency. And it will never last as a commodity as it has no intrinsic value. It has made no impact on society in 10 years and will make no impact for the next 10 years.
Blockchain itself might find some uses. Bitcoin is just trash and would take society back 100 years not forward.
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:36:36
Taxes are a thing and in a perfect world taxes would cover everything.
But that generally doesn’t happen, hence printing money and creation of government bonds etc. Often printing money or creation of government debt (which is still creating money) is better for the economy (or their election chances) than raising taxes.
And mining would be similar if the mining could go on forever and also could be done in batches when a big chunk of new funds is needed. But in reality mining will stop when all 21m bitcoins are mined and then you have a closed system where you are stuck with 21m bitcoins forever. So obviously for that 21m to last forever the value would need to go up like crazy. It’s just ridiculous to even consider really.
@_date: 2019-09-19 12:38:58
The issue is that when you split the coins the existing coins skyrocket in value.
For example you’re holding 1 coin and government needs to do another split... well the 1 bitcoin you’re holding is now worth double what it was worth previously.
This is not a good thing for the economy.
@_date: 2019-09-19 06:49:36
Hahahaha oh the CDOs didn’t cause it? Hmm why do you even know what a CDO is? Because that was the centre of the issue.
If rating agencies did their job and rated the bonds as junk instead of AAA, do you still think the collapse happens? Of course it doesn’t.
@_date: 2019-09-22 23:49:38
Mate you are the one that just ignores reality here. Has anything I’ve said been wrong? Every single time you reply you change to another topic coz I just showed you how wrong and dumb you are...
Now let’s see if you could answer any of these questions.. maybe if you understood 21st century economics you’d actually see why it can’t be a currency..
-	what does the Fed do? Why is it important to financial stability of the country
-	why does a government need to print money
-	why do we have interest rates go up and down and what impact it has on the economy, why is it done
-	why is there quantitative easing (not why it’s bad but why our society and government is using it, why is it necessary)
-	why there are exchange rates between currencies of different countries and what impacts those exchanges rates.
-	how taxation works and why it’s important
-	why tracking of large movements of cash is a good thing for society in stopping human trafficking, fraud, terrorism, drug trafficking, tax evasion etc
-	why the ability to refund and reverse transactions is so important
-	why the ability to transact cash in physical form when offline or out of power is important
Maybe if you understood even half of those points you’d realise why what you are saying is so fucking retarded.

You have been brainwashed by other people who also hope to be rich and they have a vested interest in brainwashing you to believe the same thing.
There’s a reason why the smartest guys in the world say bitcoin is garbage.
I’ve said before blockchain itself can have uses. Bitcoin is garbage and the future you see for it is a fantasy created to sell you bitcoins.

I give you a full list of reasons why a currency doesn’t work.
I explain every angle to you. You just are so desperate for it to work so you can be rich that you just ignore all logic and reason.
Just like bros who call anything they don’t like FUD. You’ll just ignore all the points in the post because if you actually had to understand the economy you’d realise it can’t be a currency and your dream is over.

Ahhh no investing long term gives no returns in an deflationary currency!
I buy a house today for $200k.... in 50 years that house would now be worth $100k.
Why would I do that?
I would be better off holding on to the $200k and in 50 years I can buy that house for half what I would buy it for today.
That’s how deflation works, try again mate.
@_date: 2019-09-19 06:04:04
Lol that’s just relabelling the same thing. If government are using bitcoin and have adopted it then they would be able to dictate to the developers what to change etc. It’s the same as the system we have now but with a new name.
If bitcoin can’t be controlled by the government and they can’t make sudden changes to save the economy in times of trouble then why would they adopt it in the first place at all?
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:40:16
And the economy will very quickly max out and be unable to grow any more. As no more coins can be mined and loaned out.
Or the alternative is the value of bitcoin grows over time.. in this case it’s a deflationary currency which will also cause the economy to stall completely.
You don’t seem to understand that the partially backed system actually help to make the economy grow.

Another crypto could be a currency... if it was government controlled and had unlimited supply. Ie. The current system on a blockchain.

And the treasury are a private company putting the money into their own pockets right?
@_date: 2019-09-20 15:40:00
Wow there is so much stupidity there it’s hard to know where to start.
Thankfully you’ve already agreed that bitcoin is not a replacement for gold or usd. It’s an alternative. In that case good luck mate, all the power to you. But usability, taxation, privacy, cost and efficiency will mean it loses to the others. If it ever did take off governments would likely ban it as they are doing with the libra now. It is not good for a society that runs on taxes to have an alternative currency.
As for everything else essentially for the most part you are describing blockchain not bitcoin. I’ve said many times blockchain may find a use in certain areas.
Bitcoin however is garbage.
We have established it has no intrinsic value.
The internet is not a commodity. How would you even describe it? It is constantly growing evolving and changing and you can’t trade it or buy it etc so you can’t give it an intrinsic value. You are trying to talk about blockchain when you discuss intrinsic value but it’s not blockchain you are trading it’s bitcoin and it’s bitcoins being produced. And they have no intrinsic value. Your computer runs all day mining in the hope to produce something that is only useful for trading with someone else. It has no value or use in the real world.
Oh and I also love that you think running 6bn machines all drawing insane amounts of power for basically zero gain would be a great idea. Let me put it this way, how much more different would the system be if it had 1bn nodes vs 6bn nodes? Would the difference be worth the power being used by those extra 5bn machines?? No of course not!! There comes a point of diminishing returns where adding extra nodes adds less value than the power they are consuming.
Some people would put that number at 1 node �� but I’ll let you decide what you think that number is, I can tell you it’s definitely less than 6bn or infinity as you’d prefer.
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:22:34
Lol two types, it’s not two types it’s the context of which you are describing it. And yes I Lee have been discussing the same context.
And yes I know bitcoin/limited supply system causes deflation and it doesn’t work that well with FBR. That’s basically been the essence of my argument all day. That an economy without FBR and inflation will not grow anything like an economy that uses FBR and inflation. I’ve explained it a million times and the only counter point you can come up with is ‘the big wigs are evil’.
Fact is an FBR system with inflation produces an economy countless times more productive and efficient than a reserve system with deflation and no FBR.
It’s basic economics.
@_date: 2019-09-19 12:41:05
Yeah an alternative to government currency doesn’t work.
Because you need taxation. You need regulation (eg minimum wages etc) and also using a currency that is not a nations default currency then adds in layers of complexity and conversions and charges that make it super inefficient.
It could only work with government running it. But then it wouldn’t be bitcoin, it would need to be a coin they can print more of like tether. But then using blockchain for transactions instead of the existing system would just be a massive step backwards.
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:25:54
You don’t seem to understand inflation vs deflation.
Print more money = inflation. Yes over the long term the buying power of your dollar goes down. This is how an economy is designed to work with about 1-2% inflation. This encourages spending and investment instead of just holding onto currency and doing nothing with it.
Change nominal BTC value to higher value = deflation. And here no one is encouraged to spend or invest their money. If they buy a house today for 1 BTC in the future it may be worth only 0.5 BTC. So best off just to hold onto it and not spend. And what does that do for businesses, jobs, economy and country as a whole? Nothing, the country goes backwards instead of forwards.
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:18:35
A commodity/asset? That has no intrinsic value but people still trade it is quite possible. Not worried about that at all will have no impact on me. Will eventually crash. But even if it didn’t, the fact people can trade silver and gold and oil etc has no impact on me.
As for currency that’s not possible. You clearly don’t understand what a currency even is.
It’s now 4.20am here so I gotta crash, cheers ��
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:14:24
Ok once again you’re just spreading more crypto lies that these subreddits fill into your impressionable heads.
1 - you’re creating some convoluted second layer solution to solve a problem that we have already solved in the existing system. Basically what you’re describing is that immutable nature is built into the chain/DB and second layer could get added for fraud protection/reversal. How about looking at the existing system which has an existing reversal system and then the banks etc have their secondary layer on top to apply security and prevent unauthorised updates. You’re trying to rebuild (very inefficiently) a system we already have.
2 - only get into bitcoin if you don’t care about fraud? Seriously? Crypto itself has had more fraud in the last few years than any space! But regardless of course any monetary/banking system needs fraud control that’s what people commit fraud for! The money!! What a crazy statement to say if you care about fraud stay away from bitcoin. Total insanity.
3 - evolution of currency. We don’t start back at square 1, things evolved as people worked out what works better. Look I just built a new truck! It’s pulled by horses. But don’t worry that’s how all good trucks start out pulled by horse, then fuel engine then electric engine. We’ll get there one day! That’s not how any of this works mate. You decide you want it to be a currency or an asset/commodity? Either way it’s shit but it doesn’t ‘evolve’ as a currency is only a currency when it’s backed by the state.
8% yup don’t believe that. And let’s just expect all these people who don’t have access to banks will need mobile phones and internet connections. Wow great idea. Guess you’re just ignoring that huge portion of the world that just runs on cash huh? Banking yourself is a bad idea, security is shit, no fraud protection, I’ve been on about this many times it’s 2am here not gonna keep explaining how dumb that is.
I’m ok with banks and government looking at my shit. With bitcoin anyone who I ever transacted with or knows my address can look at my shit. That’s a million times worse! Oh but wait they will add another layer to try and make it better.
Yup same old shit. Oh yeah our coin is crap and has loads of problems now but itll be good soon after it’s all fixed up!! Meanwhile just completely ignore that it’s got no value as a commodity and will never be a currency, so regardless of how the system is tweaked the underlying bitcoin itself is worthless.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:42:34
Hahaha I’m certain if I took the time to read the Austrian’s school of economics I could have a laugh at how you’ve misinterpreted that to somehow give you a belief that a bitcoin has some kind of value.
And honestly I’d say part of the reason I enjoy trolling in these forums and in the_donald (if I could) is the hope I could actually save some of the newbies from the insane stupidity (and thus big losses) that happens in these subs and is just re-enforced in every single post with idiotic slogans like FUD and HODL. Which are nothing more than people ignoring all logic and reason in the hope everyone else with not sell, the price will go up and they will gain. The only people spreading misinformation about cryptos for their own gains are not the bankers, investment brokers or news media it’s the crypto die hards in subs like this one.

I don’t believe this for a second.
Go ahead and explain what happened and how the bank explained it... I’m sure you’re not being truthful.
Fact is if you ask 100 people how many times they have had dodgy activity on their account due to a rogue employee vs how many times they have needed to reverse a transaction due to fraud. You will see which issue is more important.
Bitcoin bros think immutability is important and reversals/refunds are not. But it’s actually the other way around. Second tier systems apply security and accountability that prevents bad updates to the system.

Yeah this is where you guys are so lost. Just look around you. Look out the window, look at Australia, Canada, England every western civilisation. We have what we have today because of this. See how this ends? Ahh right now we are using smart phones while our electric cars drive us to work and we’re posting live IGs for our friends to immediately react to. Yeah this inflationary currency is killing me!


What the fuck? What part of this is a loan? You’re literally describing people hording their money and spending only what they need to. Exactly the situation I said is shit for an economy


This is where many of you guys are just so lost. You don’t realise **the government is by the prowl for the people**. The situation you describe is your government spending money on wars that you elected them to fight. If your government is starting wars they shouldn’t then the people should choose someone else.
But the funny thing is this central group creating money out of nothing, controlling its value, profiting from its sale and use, manipulating it to make even more money... what you are describing is crypto. The best example is bitfinex and tether and how they manipulate the BTC price. They create pumps and dumps to make money. 95% of the trades are them trading with themselves.
Yet you sit back and blame big bag government. It’s fucking amazing how it’s right there in front you and you still miss it. It’s like you’re telling me the government is a scam and the Nigerian prince you met online is gonna fix everything!
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:23:11
Hahahaha yeah it does remind me of something... beanie babies!
That’s what it is.
Fact is blockchain and bitcoin isn’t new and edgy anymore mate. It’s 10 years old and still got less than 1% of the population why? Because it’s useless and unnecessary.
You sound just like every crypto bro on here. Has no idea how anything works but sees everyone else as the brainwashed one. Maybe you need a few more years of losses to understand. Tell me another tech that’s been around for over 10 years and still has no useful real world applications?
Fact is bitcoin could die tomorrow and it would have no impact on the world except electricity might be a bit cheaper.

So newbies who come into this subreddit aren’t just flooded with bullshit propaganda all the time. This is the only way y’all can make money by fooling other idiots to believe the lies you’ve already been tricked into believing.
Edit: 
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:23:49
Wow just try to make up scenarios where you can see it working but don’t bother to consider the big picture.
I’m not even going to bother going into detail on this one. You really just try to pick one side and push it but even when pushing that you don’t bother to compare to the other side.
Let’s say everything you said is correct (except for the last sentence which is insanely dumb), what’s the difference here between inflation and deflation? Well in your example if it’s deflationary prices will keep going down so I have no incentive to get started on my upgrades or expansion, the longer I wait the more I’ll save so I just keep on waiting. Inflationary encourages you to expand the business ASAP because investing now is the cheapest time to invest, so you won’t wait and the company and economy will grow immediately.
And thinking about the person issuing the loan, why would I loan someone money to save? It makes no sense at all, people are paying interest on the money they were lent but they never spend it?? That is totally crazy. Why would I take a loan, why wouldn’t I just save up my own money? Instead of making loan repayments I just deposit my payments into a savings account every month?
Your examples are insane as you try to imagine any possible scenario where it could be a good thing instead of actually stepping back and comparing all scenarios and deciding which is better. As usual you just go with the narrative and feelings of little guy vs the big guy but in reality bitcoin would create much worse wealth inequality than we have now.
@_date: 2019-09-21 07:54:03
Nope not true at all. The only thing they share is ‘limited supply’ but no one knows how much gold is left to be mined we may well assume it’s infinite.
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value gold has plenty. This subreddit is just so uninformed. My point was not that if you are for bitcoin you’re against gold. More that if you appreciate the gold standard you should realise that bitcoin is nothing like it and could never replicate/replace the gold standard.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:47:39


We don't need that shit. Fiat money can be laundered anyway and is untraceable
People get away with murder so why even bother with murder laws.


Legal measures can be taken. Pressure put on the criminals. But, yes, the money shouldn't be easy to access. No doubt if it were an ETH ICO a hard fork could be done to retrieve the funds. :-P~~~
What?? Pressure put on the criminals, mate they are already on a beach in the Bahamas. You just gonna let them spend their 100m there while it’s sitting in an American bank? Of course not. Oh now you’re saying you could try and force even crypto holders to recover the funds! So now your idea is a hard fork of the chain every time they wanna retrieve funds? Yeah great idea! Chain would be forked every fucking week.


And if they demand gold which they will store themselves? Are you against gold ownership also??
There are processes in place to stop that. Try getting on a plane from Miami to the Bahamas while you’re carrying just $1m worth of gold. See what happens.


We should have evolved beyond the nanny state being charge of our money. 100 years ago was a disaster - countries started going off the gold standard.
Huh? What nanny state? You just agreed criminals shouldn’t have it easy. As I said you can live without laws or without taxation but you end up in a shitty civilisation. Why is no one on gold standard today? Why have countries moved to this? Because it’s the best way to create a growing and successful economy. If one country out there thought they could create a stronger more successful nation using gold standard or some other limited supply currency they would’ve done it already!! You are literally advocating that someone brings out at a car that uses a horse instead of an engine. Car companies were crazy to go away from horses!


It happened to me. And unjustifiably, to make it worse.
If true then it’s a failing of the justice system nothing to do with the monetary system. Though based on your understanding of the world I wouldn’t be surprised if your idea of “unjustifiably so” is BS.


Half of those things are already paid for with tolls and fees. Stop spending billions on defence and we wouldn't have to pay taxes. Although with the US still $22 trillion in debt they'd still insist on taxes probably.
Holy shit you have no fucking idea. Who pays for the FBI, CIA, NASA, FDA, EPA, IRS I could just keep going on and on... fees and tolls don’t cover shit. Hell even your taxes aren’t covering all of it!! That’s why your government regularly has deficits in the budget and has to print more money to pay for these things. They don’t print money to put in their own pockets they print money to keep you alive and educated and safe!


It's to further enrich the rich.
This is why you are brainwashed. You can’t appreciate the society that is the product of hundreds of years of human evolution. You want to get rich by sitting on your ass doing nothing. Bitcoin would be awful for 99% of the world. The wealth inequality would be 10 times worse than it currently is.
Mate I’m not going to ever make you appreciate the world around you. You’re like an anti vaxxer. So caught up in conspiracy theories and fear of big bad government and the illuminati you can’t appreciate hundreds of years of human advancement that has made your life so simple and safe that you can afford to sit around and bitch on an Internet forum that you’re not rich from doing nothing.
It’s fucking amazing really.
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:28:21
They might do ‘great’ regardless from our point of view. But from their POV every extra 1% of profit is important. As I said as long as you have a set up where a prosperous economy is good for them then they will be doing all they can to create those conditions. Going on how well they’ve worked so far seems like they are doing pretty good job. Don’t think you can really blame the fed for previous crashes, if anything they have played huge parts in helping the economy recover from major crashes caused usually by other parties.
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:50:42
Lolll bitcoin is not an answer at all.
What truth is shining down? What could bitcoin solve that is a problem today?
Fact is bitcoin would be terrible. Imagine there is an emergency like the one in the past few days where a bank desperately needs some temporary cash to tie them over for 24hrs. If we were using bitcoin it’s not possible. The bank fails and the economy takes a massive hit.
Anyway this is all pointless because trying to run an economy with a predefined set limit of 21m bitcoins is impossible. Any economist would tell you as much. As I said you can believe that you’ll make it on your own and run away from your parents safety and protection. But you’d see very quickly it’s a cruel world out there and you’d come rushing back.
Unfortunately you bitcoin bulls won’t ever get to see how terrible that situation would actually be. You’ll just forever sit around screaming that you wanna run away and you hate your parents! But will never see that you couldn’t survive a day without them.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:01:37
And? Not sure what your point is?
The original true believers who believed in the coin before the surge and bubble still believe in the coin now. What a shock.
The ability for the coin to generate the same or anywhere similar gains as it did previously has diminished completely. Just have a think about how much money has gone into the market (not market cap but actual money spent buying coins) and consider how much more would need to go in to sustain a run up to $1m and actually being able to sell coins at that level.
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:05:29
Hahaha yeah that’s not true at all.
Maybe what you mean is it’s not possible in a non-fractional-banking system? 
But inflation/deflation has no impact on whether a bank failing causes a big hit to the economy.
Though let me explain it in words you’d understand... An exchange collapses.
You’re still so naive you don’t realise exchanges are banks just with shitty security and fuck all regulations so no one dares keep their funds in the exchange accounts.
@_date: 2019-09-19 12:43:51
If you could actually see an economy that has no government controls like this you might actually appreciate what you have.
Federal reserve was created because of the crazy crashes and instability in the existing system. Just looking at the bitcoin chart over any period of time shows you just how crazy things would be if that was the main currency.
If you learned how an economy works, why we have interest rates, exchange rates, quantities easing etc, why are rates put up why are they put down, what is the purpose of all of this... if you looked into this stuff and understood how the economy works you’d see creating money out of thin air is actually a good thing.
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:39:53
Hahaha yeah mate some people got rich off beanie babies too.
Does that mean you should go and buy some?
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:00:17
Hahaha buddy America is the only place where using the word socialism is a technique to win any argument.
In the rest of the world it’s not a dirty word.
The developed democratic nations of the world all enjoy:
-	socialised school systems (and in many places like here in Aus, college and university too)
-	socialised health care system (our citizens don’t go broke when they break an arm or get sick)
-	socialised welfare
-	socialised child care (government subsidies for child care which make it more viable for the parent to go back to work)
-	socialised police force
-	socialised fire department
I’m sure there are many, many more parts of society that are public and run by the government for the people that work very well.
It’s only in America that any time a companies profits or the status quo is challenged people start shouting socialism to try and win the argument. It’s so ridiculously stupid. Your country is going to shit because of it. Your healthcare system is a complete joke as is your prison and education system.
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:33:35
Yeah based on that post you know absolutely nothing.
You can make up this crap about us vs them all you want. Truth is bitcoin has the worst income inequality of anything. The price itself is manipulated by whales and exchanges, 95% of trades on exchanges are wash trades to manipulate the price.
But never mind all that all you’d need to do is actually google inflation vs deflation and have a read and you’d see how dumb that post is. I’m. It forgetting the change in purchasing power the house has after 10 years. As I never mentioned what the rate of inflation/deflation was, i was simply giving you an example of why deflation doesn’t encourage investment. You can sit there and make up examples where low inflation rate the value of the asset still goes up... but your scenario means nothing when you compare to the same scenario with inflation. If inflation was invoked the value would be much higher and people could take our second mortgages or borrow against their equity as the value of the house goes up.
The incentive for paying back loans before they are devalued is the interest rate on the loan. That is already the mechanism to ensure capital value is maintained and profit is made during the course of paying off the loan over 30 years. Sure if interest rates were 0 your example of loan getting cheaper makes sense but that’s not the case.

Wow you surprise me sometimes with how crazy you can get. Why would replicating the same data across 6bn machines be any kind of feat? Why would it change our understanding of anything? 6bn machines could join the blockchain tmrw and nothing would change except electricity prices would sky rocket.
Bitcoin is the commodity/currency/store of value. You know when I go to the shop I buy stuff with money! I might use Apple Pay, visa, MasterCard, cash but regardless of the database or network being used I am spending money/cash/Aussie dollars. You need to understand the separation between the two.
@_date: 2019-09-21 09:55:38
It doesn’t matter if you can’t create it out of thin air. That doesn’t give it any value... hell you wanna by my feces and urine off me? How about my pubes? They take a long time to grow!! My shit only comes after I eat some food I’ve had to pay for.
That is not the definition of intrinsic value. The definition is whether it has any use or purpose outside of being traded. If you ignored the ‘market’ price currently and tried to value it based on demand what would the price be? And it would be $0 because there no uses for it other than trading. For example in some countries you could use goats as currency, trade 3 goats for a car, that guy trades those 3 goats for something else... but at any time you could stop and work out the intrinsic value of the goat as it could be used for meat, milk, clothing etc. Bitcoin has no purpose or use other than trading. Thus it has zero intrinsic value.
Fiat has regulated value. The government forces businesses to accept it and forces business to pay their employees with it. This gives it value. It’s very simple.
Edit: another example that’ll help you understand. For some reason bitcoin people think the energy invested gives it value. Like mining gold takes money and effort to mine and that gives it value. That approach is complete bullshit. The definition of intrinsic value is what I listed above. The energy required to produce it theory is garbage sold by bitcoin bros. By that theory if I found some gold on the ground by accident or I was building a sand castle and can across some gold or even using a metal detector I find one on the surface that requires no digging. You’re telling me if that gold was produced from a mine site that spent loads of money digging it up it’d be worth more than the bit I just picked up off the ground? Yeah nah energy used to produce it is meaning less. He’ll look at rainwater or spring water. That has value and people buy it, but no energy used to produce it.
@_date: 2019-09-20 14:31:01
Nope you’re just wrong there.
Haven’t dissed the technology of blockchain. It could have uses, most likely in private controlled environments.
It’s bitcoin that is garbage.
Edit: I’ve been banned so can’t reply anymore,  but no blockchain is not just about history it’s more about trustless updates. But my point about private chain is that in order for a business to have known costs, performance, support and uptime they need to be on a private chain.
@_date: 2019-09-27 23:09:53


Extremely safe for law abiding citizens. Much safer than an exchange or keeping it in your safe or on a usb while your house burns down. The government being able to seize money from a conman and give it back to his victims is actually a good thing for society. Not a bad thing.


No as I said you’re going backwards to old ways that have been proved not to work.


Not true at all. I can right now access my money from tens of thousands of atms all over the world on every corner of the globe within seconds. I can just tap my card and be done and on my way. I can borrow $300k and buy a new house for my family and live there while I pay it off. I can use a credit card and make endless purchases while overseas with confidence if anyone scams me or uses my card fraudulently I’d get the money refunded! Sometimes they’ll even detect it before I do!! Yeah all this for a $5 fee or some places charge no fee at all... hmmm yeah all about the oligarchies isn’t it... what the fuck do they have to do with my money anyway? Oh the guys running the banks make some money by running a successful business in the free market? Oh no!! Call the police!! Meanwhile you are happy to sit back while the crypto exchanges manipulate the markets, go down for ‘maintenance’ during a crash and use tether to pump up the values?? Yeah def picked the right side there buddy!


Exactly my fucking point. You don’t understand what you are replacing. You think you can hook up a battery to a petrol car and it’ll just run on electricity! I say what about the fuel pump? What about the combustion? How are we going to get any explosions or momentum without fuel? And your answer... you don’t need any of that shit with electricity man! Just plug in the battery and we’re done!!
And from there it just gets dumber and dumber. Where you think we don’t need taxes. Tolls can just cover everything. Yup mate I can’t be fucked wasting my time on someone with no knowledge about the world or how any of this world works. No need for taxes? Yup that’s confirmed it, you are literally not worth talking to as it’s like I’d have to teach you English before even getting you to understand what you’re missing. Wow, if your hope for bitcoin to rocket is based on the idea society can survive without taxes and government doesn’t need to generate money and pay for anything, well then bitcoin has zero hope.
Keep hanging around the subs hoping to come across someone who does get how economies and the world works and they can explain to me how they see a bitcoin future working. But seems everyone in here who is keen on bitcoin has zero understanding how an economy, government or country already works and just thinks anarchy is a great idea. Complete fucking morons, I’m sure we have monkeys that are smarter than you.

Nope got a lot of friends who bought and tried to convince me to buy over the last 2-3 years. Very happy I was able to see through all the bullshit.
The reason it will rise is because.... it will get popular... because.... economies will crumble.
Yeah good luck with that mate. Bitcoin isn’t saving any economies any time soon. Inflation is actually a positive thing if you bothered to read about the diff between inflation and deflation.
But that’s cool you stay with your currency that is manipulated by whales and crypto exchanges where 95% of the trades are wash trades. The delusion is hilarious.

Loll mate I couldn’t care less..
Everyone I know who had harassed me about getting into crypto in the last few years are dead silent. When I do ask them how it’s going they are like meh pretty much all gone don’t even know how to access it any more. The fad has come and gone and I’m so happy I was able to avoid the shit show and sit back and just watch all the scams and crypto people defending the dodgy exchange ceos when they are doing this dodgy shit crypto bros would say the banks do. It’s all very entertaining.
Don’t believe me well jump into my post history and go crazy... I’m posting a lot here today because in the past I couldn’t post more than 2 or 3 comments before I got banned for FUD. Was so funny you sensitive little snowflakes declaring everything and anyone with any sense as FUD.

Another story where we can all gather around and enjoy relishing how bad bitcoin is! In a bitcoin world the only thing standing between that guy and his money is your conscience.
What a great world we live in where my money is secure in my bank account and any transactions in and out are protected and able to be reversed in critical scenarios. A world where I don’t need to go and do dodgy cash transactions in a car park with a guys laptop and believe what he is doing. Wow what an amazing trustless world!!
How you could be so excited and giddy about the future, while just having stepped backwards in time 100 years to do your transaction is insanely ironic.
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:59:39
Lol you said over and over you don’t need government for this or that.
Maybe the point you are trying to make is that we don’t need additional funds, the government should be able to survive on our taxes with no new funds.
And yes that is ideal in planning but doesn’t happen in practice. Look at the USA now, running massive deficit and should be raising taxes like crazy but they have actually lowered taxes! In some cases raising taxes could be bad for the people too... in some cases it is better that the government take on the debt (eg. Build a school) then the community benefit from that (get educated and get better jobs) and they end up paying for it in higher taxes down the line. But the initial investment often would need to come from government.
You don’t have a clue how any of it works mate.
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:59:21
Hahahahaha educated me huh.
Wow your great solution is to replace one group of people with another group of people.
Trust me if this system was already in place when you were born and was a pre existing system you’d have the same bullshit views you do now. Oh they are evil they are out to get us!! People are fearful of those in power and that’s all this is.
They haven’t actually don’t a single thing that impacts you badly. In fact I’m sure they’ve made plenty of decisions that have benefited your life. But because you want to get rich for doing nothing you’re determined bitcoin is the answer. When the fact is the current system is doing better than a bitcoin system ever could.
Ahh I’m literally the one that said to you fed has to be independent for decisions but it is a tool of the government. It’s not a private company making profits off these decisions and selling out a country. It’s a group of people highly educated just as you say you want running things...
 Voting for people is not the answer anyway. Think Trump would be a good fed guy do ya?? Popular is not the answer when it comes to the economy.
Basically you have now argued to have a fed board in control of everything and you said you want the smartest guys running it.... so what’s the problem??? Ohhh that crazy paranoia that the current guys aren’t the smartest but they are corrupt and evil... wow I’m shocked.
As I said doesn’t matter who is on that board and how they got there. After 5-10 years you’d call them all evil and corrupt too.

@_date: 2019-09-19 04:50:21
Yeah mate your system of government is very fucked up.
It values companies and lobbyists more than people. Here is hoping someone like Bernie can turn the tide but once the corruption is already in place it is hard to get rid of.
Most other developed countries around the world don’t have the issues you have with lobbyists and government co-operating with private enterprise as much.
Your healthcare system is the perfect example. Across the rest of the developed world every country has seen that it is cheaper to have government involved where they can reduce costs and remove profit margins from healthcare. But in the USA healthcare is seen as a free market opportunity for companies to make money off. Some of the hospital bills we see from there are just totally insane.
So your country does have serious issues with government being too involved with lobbyists and corporations. But for decades the fear of ‘socialism’ and communism has played into the hands of big corporations perfectly. Rest of the world we don’t really have that crazy fear of those terms, we know we are a democracy and we’re good with that. But in your country any time a companies profits are under threat people yell out about socialism and everything goes back to normal.

Hey it is possible look at Venezuela or Zimbabwe. I’m not saying it’s not possible.
But having a government elected by the people to manage the value of the currency is a lot better than having whales and crypto exchanges control the value of a currency!


Some of the dumbest shit I’ve read today.
None of that gives it value. That’s like saying paper gives the USD value. That’s what it’s made from that’s not what gives it value mate. USD has value because the government mandates that businesses must accept it and employers must pay people with it. Bitcoin’s value is mandated by whatever the exchange/whales think it should be worth today. It is entirely based on the greater fool theory where it is only worth something if you can get a bigger fool than you to buy it off you for more than you paid. It has zero intrinsic value or regulated value.
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:08:17
Nah because that’s not how an economy works.

The hilarious thing is that you guys get together with this mindset like this is the future and no one understands it!!
But the reality is **you don’t understand how a functioning economy works** so you’re all out here talking up this tech that you think no one understands as the next big thing.
But at the same time you don’t actually understand the system you’re trying to replace. It’s like building notepad and then saying you’re gonna replace Microsoft office with this great new solution.
How is a government meant to build hospitals, schools, roads.. how are they supposed to pay police, firemen, government agencies? How are people supposed to get loans for cars or homes or business etc.
BTC as a currency would never work. And if you can’t see that it means you have no clue how an economy works. So sure sit back feeling smug others don’t get crypto, but you don’t get economics which is much more important!

Why is an echo chamber? Here bitcoiners only way to make money is for new people to buy in. At some people are into tech, some into banks, some into snorting some into indexes and some are into property. There are also some interested in crypto.
Why wouldn’t it work? Well please read my post history for a larger breakdown but the most simple way to explain it is this:
As a currency, it needs to be state backed and the government needs to be able to print more money and also be able to seize money. For example major criminal organisation or terrier network is planning an attack, freezing their assets is a huge thing that is good for society. Also this means we can use credit cards and do transactions online safe knowing that if there is a problem it will be refunded. But most of all a currency needs to be inflationary to build a good economy and the state needs to be able to print more of it to keep building new services and issue new debt etc. Without the ability to do all of this the economy would stall. New business growth would stop, jobs would dry up and the country would grind to a halt. There is a reason no one uses gold-backing in their economies any more. To have a successful growing economy you need inflation and the government needs funds. There’s also loads of other issues like privacy, performance, physical transfer etc etc. But I’ve just given you the top level items.
The dollar has regulated value. Never said it has intrinsic value.
Intrinsic value is required for something that you want to trade as a store of value like Gold, silver, oil etc... for it to hold value without any regulations it needs to have other uses, aka intrinsic value. The dollar on the other hand has regulated value. The state requires every business to accept it. They require businesses to pay with it. Minimum wage is set using the dollar. And they have regulations in place to ensure that you aren’t suddenly paying $5 for a can of coke.
Items with intrinsic value don’t need these kind of regulations to maintain the value, because they have other purposes. Bitcoin has no purpose or intrinsic value and it also would never be backed by a state as a currency as it wouldn’t function.

Lol and I’ll ask everyone who’s bought crypto in the past 3 years how that’s working out for them... pretty much most people are down 80%+ because the dreams of a crypto world completely ignored basic economics.

Using Venezuela as an example for anything is useless. Similar in the way using Hitler as an example for anything is over the top.
Just because 1 mad man (Hitler) or 1 country (Venezuela) went way off the rails doesn’t mean the underlying system is broken. No system is completely foolproof.
@_date: 2019-09-19 02:49:48
So let me give you an example you can understand.
We go with bitcoin, how much of the $21m does the government hold for spending on projects like this?
How is it possible that whatever amount of bitcoin the government has, this will pay for every school, hospital, road etc for the next 10,000 years?
You really need to read about inflation vs deflation. A limited money supply causes deflation and the country goes backwards. To support population growth, economy growth etc you need unlimited supply. Even if 1 bitcoin was worth $1 million dollars you’d still eventually run out of funds.
For example when government issued this latest round of ‘loans’ to help out the banks. What would’ve happened if we were using bitcoin? No new money, everything would’ve come to a halt.
@_date: 2019-09-19 06:48:07
There is a hell of a lot more to socialism than the currency. And what next you’ll say fractional reserve banking leads to Hitler, Stalin and nuclear wars!
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:57:38
It doesn’t work like that.
Introducing socialist aspects to a capitalist structure doesn’t weaken the capitalist structure it actually strengthens it.
Each system has its problems and gaps. A purely capitalist system would not provide welfare or schooling for the poor, it’s not in the interests of business. Fed reserve was brought in in 1923 to solve the economic crisis that was happening way too frequently. Again it was a socialist solution to gap in the capitalist framework.
You are like most Americans who see socialism as some kind of cancer or contagion. When actually it’s a tool societies decide to use to help the people where needed.
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:47:35
I’m so sorry they brainwashed you.
It’s clear none of the people here understand how an economy works why we have interest rates, quantitive easing, exchange rates, monetary policy at all.
They think an economy can just run on its own. They have no idea why a fed reserve is even needed or what it does.

Yeah that’s exactly the problem people here make. They’re like I’m smart I can learn about bitcoin! But then you just believe what bitcoiners tell you about the economy. You think everyone that falls for a cult like Scientology goes into it thinking of I’m gonna let these guys brainwash me! Everyone thinks they are smart enough to avoid it. Once you’ve been convinced you think you are the smarter one now and anyone unconvinced is dumb.


Who would know better about the kids being sick than their own mums!! Their mums are the ones that know if vaccines are making them sick!! As I’ve said before bitcoiners know bitcoin but not the economy. Just because USD is printed on paper doesn’t mean a paper expert can tell you how the economy works and what’s so good about the usd. Bitcoiners can tell you what’s great about bitcoin but they can’t tell you what a currency is or what a store of value is and why bitcoin could ever work as a currency or a store of value.


No I’m not wrong. You are right that things should be looked at with a skeptic eye which is exactly why I am not wrong. These subreddits have been flushed out of dissenters and skeptics. For months and even years anyone who said anything bad about bitcoin or crypto would be immediately banned and everything they said would be labelled as FUD.
That created this massive echo chamber with no dissent and no skepticism. That has led us to where we are today, where 99% in these subs have no perspective about the issues with bitcoin or crypto because these subs have just been massive echo chambers the entire time.

@_date: 2019-09-19 22:09:31
That’s the thing mate you’ve done well to identify that.
Now what you need to realise is the system and the currency are two different things.
The blockchain system itself has a shitload of holes and problems with it. It’s crazy inefficient and slow and expensive. But in this thread I’ve not even addressed all the issues the blockchain system would cause the economy.
I’ve simply been concentrating on the impact that using bitcoin as a currency would have on us.
You are right to say the blockchain system is backed by mathematics etc... but the currency itself does not gain intrinsic value just because it’s tied to a ledger.
As I’ve explained in here a lot intrinsic value means it also has value as another use.. as gold is used in production and Jewellery and people every day are buying it for the gold price to use rather than invest.
While as a currency the usd has value because it’s regulated by the government, companies must pay employees in usd with minimum wages set in usd and businesses must accept usd in exchange for goods.
These are the reasons gold and usd have value. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value as it’s not used for anything other than trading. And it has no regulated value because no government has backed it.
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:43:01
If they thought it might go down in value they wouldn’t hold it.
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:38:36
Lol you’re the perfect example of the crazy paranoia that’s made so many crypto bros get into the scene.
What tyranny is your bank currently subjecting you to? What freedom are you fighting for? Hmm the ability to safely store your money somewhere, in a currency that has very low volatility so you can actually keep it there for years and save by adding more to it regularly. Oh you how about accessing your money from machines installed all over the planet that you can walk up to and use 24/7. Oh wait? You’d prefer not to even get your money out of your account, you’d like to just swipe (or tap) a card on a payment machine when you’re out shopping and have the money be taken from your account later on? Ok sure thing.
Moved on from using your own money and want $300k to buy yourself a house... Look out those tyrannical banks are at it again, offering you hundreds of thousands of dollars!
Phew thank god for crypto, someone save me from this tyrannical madness. /s

Maybe with enough of these articles y’all will release the Fed has many different things it can do to assist the economy when needed.
A system running on bitcoin wouldn’t have these things so we would constantly suffer economic uncertainty.
The Fed was literally created to add stability to financial markets and this is just one of the many ways it can do it.

Coming here is not the right way to research it.
That’s like trying to find out if Scientology is real and a legit religion by going directly to some Scientologist and asking them if it’s good or bad, fake or real.
Don’t take advice from people in this sub that love bitcoin. They have already been brainwashed by others in the sub.. it’s a viscous cycle like most MLM businesses. Everyone that comes asking for advise is told it’s amazing and to buy in, just because that’s the only way the existing holders have any chance of making a profit.

You don’t have a clue about how the world works buddy.
@_date: 2019-09-19 02:11:53
Because the economy would not grow.
Limited supply of money means as population grows the average wealth decreases. And there is no incentive for investment etc.
As I listed in my post the government would have no way to pay for schools, hospitals, roads, police, firemen etc etc.
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:19:45
Thats the hilarious thing. People thinking this would be a redistribution of wealth. Doesn’t matter what you use to record wealth, USD, BTC or gold. If the rules of how you accrued that wealth stay the same then the big boys will keep the money/BTC etc rolling in after any change.
You wanna work on redistribution of wealth then campaign for higher minimum wages, universal healthcare, higher taxes for the rich, more sick leave, annual leave for workers etc etc. Make it more profitable to be lower and middle class and give them the ability to move up in the world by hard work and earning money. You don’t change the world by swapping currency for another format that achieves nothing.
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:45:32
Loll as usual just sound like some religious person describing the holy land.
No actual details about how this amazing economy could actually function. How this ‘golden age’ would actually happen and why it would happen.
Fact is fed reserve was brought in because there were so many economic crisis happening they needed some control. Remove it and go to bitcoin and you’re back to having a crisis every few months.

You have no idea about the progress of humanity of hundreds of years. Don’t you realise that government was created because it’s more efficient to have everyone chipping in than some people. Like you want a road that goes to the bakery right? But that road runs in front of my house and bobs house and in front of the bakery.. why would we let you build there? I wanna build my own road to the bakery and charge you to use it! I bet the baker would like to own the road outside his bakery too!
Just think about what you are saying. It’s complete nonsense.
Again a bitcoin bull who’s vision for bitcoin working is tacking the world back to medieval times and destroy all the progress of humanity.
By the way who are going to pay for police? Fire department? Courts? Jails?
It’s like talking to third graders around here. You just wanna imagine the world as something where bitcoin works but to do that you have to ignore every aspect of reality that you currently enjoy.

A track record where for  90% of that period it’s value was less than 1% of it’s current price. Also a huge amount of scams and unrecoverable coins in that time. In those 10yrs it still has zero mainstream uses. Wow great track record.


I’ll take my bank’s security every day of the week compared to an exchange. Id also happily take a safe compared to cold storage wallet. Fact you can be scammed with no method of recourse means it’s much less secure or safe than fiat.


Lol and? actually changes in the underlying tech is a bad thing for reserve asset. Things should be stable, reliable, predictable. Bitcoin is none of that.
-	Institutional adoption
Lol adoption is basically non existent. You call adoption when 1% of institutions hold BTC? 0.1% or 0.01% or 0.001%? Doesn’t really matter as there is almost zero adoption in 10 years.


Not private at all. the chain is public i can view account holdings and transactions. Last thing i want is other people knowing what transactions i’m doing.
-	Politically neutral
not really, the distribution is so inequal you dont actually know who the biggest holders are and what their political aims are. Maybe Rupert Murdoch has one of the biggest holdings.
-	User sovereignty
While destroying a country’s sovereignty and it’s ability to run an economy.
-	Virtuous liquidity cycle
This means nothing. It can actually be very bad, he is basically saying that much of what drives activity on the chain is just people reacting to movement. Eg. Bull run of buyers, more people buy. But bear run of sellers and loads of people sell. In fact this year it’s been on the sell side. Again this is not actually a good thing for reserve, the last thing you want with reserve asset is big swings one way or the other.
Edit: lol I love this subreddit. Keep downvoting me without actually arguing any of the points listed. It’s the same in every thread, coiners unable to actually describe any world where crypto works.

Where do you want to start?
As a currency? Any currency needs government oversight and ultimately control. Taxes, regulations, monetary policy and the ability to print money are all requirements for a functional economy.
As a store of value? The upsides are far outweighed by the downsides, we can go in to list each. But the volatility and the lack of any intrinsic value are the starting point.
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:51:13
Lol hope you find a way to pass that econ major. Because id like you to actually make points rather than insults.
Please go ahead and tell me how I’m wrong.
Tell me how an economy can function without government having federal reserve, without government being able to collect taxes, without gov being able to freeze accounts and put caveats on land titles etc, tell me how they can raise huge funds for massive infrastructure projects, tell me how they can enforce money laundering, drug trafficking, tax evasion laws in a crypto world.
Please instead of just saying ‘you’re wrong’ how about actually making some valid points.
Ahhh futurist major here, I can tell you right now you’re all completely wrong. Might as well sell up and go home fellas.
Edit: very clear you’re either not an econ major or doing very badly if you think sunk costs can never be recovered. You’re just plain wrong on that. Sunk costs are basically any costs that are used to consider current value. Current value should have no relation to original costs.

No that’s a physical wallet and a safe.
A bank is typically used to transfer money, exchange money, get loans, invest money and also store it.
The only reason you don’t store money on an exchange is because they aren’t trust worthy. If they were regulated the way they should be they would be the banks of the crypto world.

1 - Crypto is a hundred times more volatile than fiat. 
2 - mathematically proveable is a buzz phrase that means nothing that is used by idiots.
3 - “money cartel” is actually the government created by the people for the people. Without the government being able to control creation of money and value, you’d have no roads, schools or hospitals. The value of your paycheck would bounce up and down every week like your crypto holdings. Fact is wealth distribution is 50 times worse in crypto land than fiat.


Lol more buzz words and dreams. Yes blockchain should mean each dollar is traced but the reality of trying to use crypto within government wouldn’t be worth it.
All the issues i mention can just be sorted out? Yeah everyone keeps saying that but its bullshit.
The current economy that issues loans, bonds, stocks and relies on gov policy to keep a stable dollar and home loans affordable. The regulations to ensure taxes are collected and fraudulent/illegal activity can be prevented and monitored.
Dude its like saying that you’ll just swap out the Keyboard on your PC for a PS4 controller. Everything will sort itself out. Im over here saying no you can’t write a word doc with a ps4 controller and you’re like ahhh its fine, it’ll all work out. As long as games are easier to play everything else will be fine. Stop living in the pre-controller era, we’ve moved on get with the future!

“Shouldn’t” isn’t the same as “don’t”.
Go ahead dream up a new economy without a government backed currency and see how you go. It’s not a coincidence that countries all around the world run on currencies backed by their government or others.
Your issue is with the inefficiencies and opaqueness of government. That is not an argument for a new currency which if used would destroy the economy.
You only notice when things go bad but you have no appreciation for when things are working as they are designed. You say ‘monetary policy?’ Well this shows you don’t know or value what the government is doing to keep the economy running from interest rates to taxes to issuing of bonds and other practices like quantitative easing. There are countless systems, processes and checks and measures in place to ensure the economy runs well and continues to grow, you have a job and you can live off your paycheck. Bitcoin can not replace all of these systems. 
All this garbage about government controlling you or your money is just pure bs. 


Wtf are you on about. I earn a decent wage, invest my money, take a loan from the bank to get a house before I can actually buy it myself.. pay it off, cash out my investments, retire happily. Where the fuck do I need political money or the government is controlling my life. This is a free market the people created. Y’all talk like you’re living in a prison and your taxes and printing of money doesn’t pay for your roads, schools, hospitals, police, army etc.
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:46:39
Get better sources. That’s not true.
It’s typically when the recovery would be less than what is spent. And a decision is made about future investment not based on current worth but what was invested already. The fallacy is that current worth relates to previous invested amount rather than actual current worth. Eg. Buying a car and adding $10k mods to it. But you can only sell for $5k more than you bought it. The $10k isn’t entirely unrecoverable. Next time you have to repair the car and get a bill for $5k you decide it’s worth repairing because $5k is one third of what you think the car is worth but that’s due to sunk cost fallacy, the actual worth of the car is the market value.
@_date: 2018-12-05 00:26:42


Right now you are saying crypto will stabilise to similar levels like fiat if we all adopt it! That is a very long way from suggesting that crypto will save us from fiat volatility. Once again you are guessing at an upside and that upside is not actually an upside it would just match fiat’s stability if you are right, if you are wrong everyone would be fucked. Why change from fiat?


Because yout government runs defIcits. So the spendimg far outweighs tax revenue. Why do you think money is printed? You say we need to close down the money printing cartel but you have no idea why money needs to be printed. You just imagine its some scam to make someone rich. And yes of course crypto would decimate taxes. Without government being able to monitor bank accounts via banks informing them of interest paid, transfers etc people would avoid tax like crazy. That is literally one of the main upsides touted about crypto is that it makes it easier to hide assets and avoid taxes.


With the right kind of chain it could be done. But when you start talking about a chain managed by gov where they control issuing of new coins etc then it starts to become a debate of why bother going to crypto if it is set up to mimic the current system yet we lose a lot of features of the current system like physical cash.
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:33:22
Lost sell at $4K and you are losing.
And that was my point.
Your average was $5200, you somehow think averaging down is going to help relive you of that $1k-$1200 gap between your average and current price.
So you somehow think you’ll save that money by buying more and averaging down. Instead of saving money you’ve just doubled down on a dying asset.
And your idea that sunk costs are irrecoverable is just plain wrong. It’s just that you are not considering the costs previously incurred when projecting your future profits from your latest investment. In this case you’re all excited to average down and see potential for more profit with a lower average, but as im saying the volume invested already and the additional volume to buy to average down has just increased your bags and liability a huge amount. You only see the potential upside but don’t recognise the additional liability you’ve just added, as I say doubling (or in this case tripling) down on a crashing asset.
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:22:50
Hahaha this is the sunk cost fallacy.
You bought more to average down. But in fact you really just threw more money down the toilet. You had limited exposure before and now you’re all in on a sinking asset. Should’ve stayed with your $5200 average.
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:42:39
Ah I said money was printed to hand out to people who can afford to pay loans. Liking working families who want to buy their first home. This is all regulated and even interest rates are set to ensure stability. You dream about some bit rich guys conspiracy but it’s a well designed system to ensure you have a job and can get a loan etc.
Distrubtion numbers? Very easy, here you go... just remember to add the number of people with 0 BTC to the chart.
30% of entire bitcoin wealth is with 47 people. Lol great wealth distribution mate.
Edit: that chart is very old but I’d welcome you to find any other source that shows bitcoin doesn’t have an awful distribution when you consider all the people with 0 coins.
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:14:49
Yes and you know why this happens? You know who is getting these loans? This is how an economy grows. If a bank can only lend the same amount of money it holds the economy would completely stall. Businesses and people need loans. This isn’t some scheme to make rich people richer, it’s a way to ensure that money is available on credit to those who can pay it back. This is the best way to keep an economy growing and job growth up and unemployment down.
You really need to research how economies run in general not just the banking system. The banking system is different from the specific currency being used which is different from monetary policy of a government which is different again from the taxation scheme of a nation etc etc. It is a complex web and the currency used is one piece of the machine but like a part in a car engine, you can’t just swap it out for something completely different and expect everything to work itself out. No one on here can give a viable outline of bitcoin taking over.

Lol how many wedding rings, earrings, chains etc are there around the world? This is pretty standard. But really what would happen is you still use cash and if you can’t get to your bank account you would cash your gold for cash at various places.
But yes in a dystopian scenario, bitcoin is pure trash. Nobody wants your usb of digital money in times of crisis. They want hard cash and valuables.
Want to know the gaps read my comment history or just comments in this thread. The start of it is the fact you need government, taxation, regulation, monetary policy etc etc for a functional economy. None of this really works with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:07:05
That’s the thing.
As you say banking and much day to day life doesn’t change. As in there is actually not much upside as this sub talks about with getting rid of banks etc.
Then you talk about wealth inequality. Well fact is if we moved to crypto the inequality would be 100 times worse than it is right now so you’re making the problem worse not better.
The middle man nickel and diming you is a fallacy. Either you need banking services, CC services, ATM services the same as you do now which would need to be maintained by people and companies the same as they are now. Or you don’t need these services and you wouldn’t need them now.
But this idea that lets replace USD with BTC to get away from overdraft fees and transfer fees is just stupid. First of all the fees aren’t really much of an issue, last time I paid any fees or interest with my bank was about 18 months ago. Since then I’ve earned five times that in interest.
Plus exchanges already charge fees now, this doesn’t change in crypto world. What you are bitching about banking fees now would just be exchange/crypto bank fees of the future. Yes the blockchain can maintain your bitcoins for free but in reality the cost of maintenance is the payout given to miners which over time reduces the value of your holdings.
But anyway at the end of the day as we’ve listed here there is almost no upside to this crypto world. While the downsides are numerous. I’ve already listed many items like collecting taxes, enforcing laws, managing printing of money and interest rates (to maintain value and keep economy and job creation going).
As I’ve said many times, the upsides to a crypto world are almost non existent. While the downsides are basically a non functioning economy as the government can’t run properly and business would be stalled and the value of any currency would be volatile as anything. People who think crypto can work never consider how an economy actually runs.
@_date: 2018-12-05 09:39:28
If the internet went down no one would trade bitcoin. It would be worthless. All of it’s benefits have gone, people would use cash, gold or other valuables or easily tradeable commodities. Just because each bitcoin has a long transaction history doesn’t actually give it any intrinsic value.
I said it didn’t replace anything that had upsides over it. The internet could replace every function you had on a BBS system. Internet is an evolution of BBS systems in many ways.
Bitcoin as I’ve said many times is missing many core components that make it viable for use as a currency or store of value. There are huge gaps when compared to existing currencies or stores of value. When looking for the next evolution of money or currency you can’t have such gaping holes and deficiencies.
@_date: 2018-12-05 01:52:19
Fact: Your family only know about your crypto holdings and interest because you ranted on to them about it during the boom telling them they should get on.
So if you have been spewing positive propaganda about crypto/bitcoin during the boom times then you have to expect to have negative news/stories come back to you during negative times.
Y’all here like ‘c’mon mum this is a long term investment’ but this time last year you were ranting on about it and the gains you’d made to everyone who would listen.
Reap what you sow.

Pretty much. To me it feels like the propaganda spread around this sub to curious people is the equivalent of some email and telephone scams you read about. Naive people genuinely looking for help and interested in what this whole bitcoin/blockchain thing is about come in here and don’t realise they are just in this circle jerking echo chamber. Where they will never hear a bad word spoken and of course the longer they spend in here the more money they’ll be convinced to pour into it. Yes people should be more critical and wary with their money but when it comes to technology like this it’s only natural to try and find help to understand it. Problem is they don’t realise that they are a mark, walking around wide eyed and clueless at the carnival.

Bitcoin actually one of the most unfeasible creations since moviepass. Enjoy your ride down!
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:02:08
On both ends the question remains. Is there a better solution? As I pointed out this system is not to make the rich richer its to enable people to get credit whether it’s to start a business and create jobs or to buy a home.
Bezos has created thousands of jobs and provided a market place for thousands of companies and hosting services for just as many. He’s built an empire, should he be stuck on a standard wage the entire time? He’s actually now raised the minimum wage at Amazon to what was it $15 an hour? Leading the way for the entire county and ahead of the government. Actually helping distribution.

Lol I’ve been saying that exchanges are similar to banks in all my posts. The one difference is security. While here everyone says don’t leave your money on an exchange, the opposite is true for banks. One is secure the other is not.
Nitpicking for the sake of nitpicking ?
Dude that has to be one of the lowest effort articles I’ve ever read.
A couple of examples:
10 year track record = 10 years is a long time. Who cares what happened during that time
Institutional adoption = some big firms have realised they can make money by supporting crypto to their customers. That’s not adoption, it’s offering a product that is current trending. Doesn’t mean the firm has adopted it or believes in it.
Oh and the best one of all!
Improving privacy = the article basically says this is shit. There is no privacy at all, there is a plan for possibly adding some privacy but again that goes back to my previous point you don’t want a reserve currency that is changing all the time.
It’s not nitpicking mate. It’s reading a completely garbage article and pointing out that it is the laziest article anyone could write without any actual basis or facts to back up the argument. Just another propaganda piece with no actual substance.

Do you have any clue how new money is created? Any idea why it’s done? Any idea what would happen to the economy if it stopped? Any idea how your services are all paid for?
If you actually consider the numerous things that the government, federal reserve and regulations and taxes do you’d have some idea why the USD survived the 2008 crisis without your money being worthless at any point.
You are trying to replace the fuel in a car with electricity. It doesn’t work, the entire system has to be rebuilt. That isn’t going to happen, we need governments to print money, we need them to ensure that the dollar is accepted everywhere and maintains a stable value. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:30:15
Huh? When did I say the currency is not sound?
How is it not sound? Most of your post is pure gibberish.
Money does not equal speech everywhere, here in Australia we do not have the issues of money in politics as you do. But regardless the wealth distribution of bitcoin is much worse than fiat anyway so this myth about giving power to the people is garbage, the problem becomes even worse.
It’s not the rich getting all the loans. Every middle class person aims to have a home loan, it’s the backbone of the economy. Without loans this can’t happen.
It’s ironic because it’s bitcoin where the rich get richer by printing new money. Don’t believe me? Look at all the blocks that have been mined in the last month and see which accounts they are linked to? You think the average guy out there is getting his piece or you think the big mining firms with the biggest holdings are the ones making more bitcoin mining every day?

That’s the thing in this forum everyone has completely different ideas about bitcoin.
I’ve regularly talked about the possibility that blockchain may lead to some innovative systems, personally I feel only private chains would really work in most cases but we will see. So far with all the time and money invested I am surprised to see so little progress in the mainstream, tech usually is not this slow to find a killer use especially in this day and age.
Bitcoin itself, as you say maybe a niche use like Silk Road... but as a mainstream use, I don’t see it and as a competition to fiat or gold it’s laughable. Blockchain should never really be used like this, it’s like the inventor of plastic saying hey I’ve created a currency! No, people with an existing currency or need will use plastic as the tool to implement their currency. Similar with bitcoin, only the black market needed a currency everyone else is ok with theirs. As the Petro has shown, it’s not the tech being used that defines the value or viability of a currency it’s about the government/people behind it.

No a hardware wallet is the equivalent to your physical wallet (or a safe) that’s where the name came from. Exchanges are banks but without the security and regulations that force them to have that level of security. It’s simple.
And click on the link and you’ll see it is actually an article.

Lol I’m happy to lose karma in this sub. If I save someone $500 I’ll happily give up my imaginary internet points.
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:57:33
Loll any smart person wouldn’t go near any crypto period.
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:12:18
Lol I love that you don’t address any of the points. You just spew the same old fantasy lines about new money, future, smart people.
Go and look at the smart people around the world and you’ll find most of them say bitcoin is pure garbage. Is running on the greater fool theory. Money is not from your central bank it’s the authorised currency of the land which businesses must accept. It’s a currency protected by you government. Hell even during the 2008 crash did the price of a coke suddenly jump to $5? No, you have no appreciation for the system as it stands. You live in a dream world.
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:39:21
Lol what? Yes the interest is in selling their good for something they can trade to buy something else.
The baker creates the bread market, the farmer creates the potato market, the banks create a loan market. You have resources you are able to sell you create a market or sell on an existing one. Jesus you guys are surely all members of aren’t you?
Free market is about allowing people to set up businesses and charging what they like, where the demand and supply in the market will determine the price. Freely without government control. But the surrounding economy always needs support and the government needs to support the currency so the free market will work.

Yes when the recovery would be nothing or so little that you decide you’d rather re-invest that is a sunk cost. That’s exactly what he did here.
As you see in any sunk cost example, where the company is deciding whether to upgrade the outdated factory or build a new one if they factor what they paid for the factory originally rather than the current value they are falling for sunk cost fallacy.
That is what he has done here. With his new investment, instead of considering is the buy price of $3800 (or whatever he bought at) a good current market price, he instead considers it is a good price because of what he has sunk into his bitcoin investment already, much of which is not recoverable at that point.
Edit: also love the fact you still can’t actual make a single valid point for bitcoin. The only thing you can do is say ‘you’re wrong!’ And try to nitpick terminology instead of actually discussing the merits of bitcoin or crypto and how it could actually work or why my arguments are wrong. Instead you can only argue why I’m using the wrong phrase during my argument. Lol so good.
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:21:30
Wow what a response.
Really showed me.
Tell me about your hopes and dreams for bitcoin and I’ll tell you why they’re all a huge fantasy. Bitcoin is a get quick rich fad, once the crypto bro’s drop out and realise it won’t go mainstream it will die off.
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:20:08
You do see the irony here right?
You guys here with skin in the game are more compromised than any banker.
Bitcoin won’t replace banks or bankers. Even in a crypto world banks are needed, so there isn’t a threat to bankers they will be fine.
But it’s you guys here that refuse to listen to anything negative (if it’s negative it’s FUD!) because it is bad news for your gains. You’re way more deluded and compromised than any bankers.

It doesn’t rely on the Internet? That’s not true. Internet goes down across the world tomorrow, 99% of bitcoin trading evaporated and any trading that does happen can’t be confirmed. You might be saying it doesn’t rely on the port 80, or html protocol?
I have never said the Internet was a fad. We were excited when we first heard about it and excited when we first were able to get online. It was not replacing an existing system that was already extremely functional and had countless upsides over the Internet. Bitcoin provides very few upsides and countless downsides which I’ve posted about in this thread a lot already.
You can describe great ideas about money without third party and digital scarcity. But I could also sit here and mention the peace and quiet of living on the moon and the escape from the laws of mankind. Doesn’t change the fact there’s no oxygen, food or systems to keep me alive. This is what you do, grasp to amazing ideals but fail to recognise that the current systems run the way they do for a reason. Not having a third party means people are easily scammed and there is no way to get your money back. But that said you are relying on third parties like exchanges and the writers of the software and wallets you use, so the idea of being trustless is another huge fallacy. Thought people might’ve leaned that after Mt Gox.
You’re right it’s not going anywhere. Been around 10 years and not a single mainstream use. Still as useless and unappealing to the mainstream as ever.
Blockchain could have potential business and b2b uses but bitcoin itself is just a waste of time.
@_date: 2018-12-05 08:45:58
Why is it anything like the Internet? It’s nothing like the Internet. Making dumb comparisons isn’t actually an argument for it having any use.
