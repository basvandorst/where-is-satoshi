Tether running out of steam + regulatory FUD in India + whales selling are my 3 guesses.

Tether "minting" USDT. All the way up.

Which platform do you use?

Cool, thanks for the info. I was playing around with a moving averages bot for a while before binance left the US, and just haven't found a good alternative yet.

This isn't caused by "whales," per se. It's long contracts being liquidated on bitmex. $150 million of long contracts to be more precise. Check here:

It depends on what your class project requires, but learning the in's and out's of an API can be quite time consumer. I might suggest downloading some data on the price of bitcoin (e.g. [cryptodatadownload.com]( total supply of bitcoin (e.g.  [ ), maybe hashrate (?), and merge them all together for some multiple regression.

And don't forget the $80 million liquidation 2 days ago. THIS is why the price is falling--a 70-30 long-short imbalance finally being corrected. People are looking for explanations in gold and the global economy. But I think this is it. Just bad gambling decisions that people made 30 days ago, finally meeting their reckoning.

I believe the reasoning is that the reward of mining is spread thinner, so miners are forced to sell more to keep operations going?

My source still shows more longs than shorts. What makes you say there are more shorts on the books than longs? (Genuinely asking!)

Start checking futures. If you look, you'll see that liquidated longs and shorts are driving the ups and downs that we've been seeing this past month. The trick is to know when and how much will be liquidated at what time. Only then can you predict these short term fluctuations.

Thanks for the info!--I just saw the $150 mil drop from bitmex. Do you know if this is the case for all futures trading platforms, or just bitmex? I've been checking longs/shorts of bitfinex, and it doesn't seem to dump like bitmex does--and I've been having a harder time predicting when those are settled.

Gold actually fell in price before blasting off before the 2008 recession. This may be a repeat of that..?

I just lost some, too. A bunch of people did. Good luck, hang in there.
