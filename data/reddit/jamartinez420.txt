Just so you folks know, phishers can register email addresses that end  or  and many others that look legit. They also can find your full name from Facebook and phone numbers that can be used to search you before targeting you. They have legit looking logos and when you go to click on the response link sometimes it'll take you to a PayPal looking website where you "log in". This  is a generated form that you put your email and password, you click enter and it kicks you to the real PayPal troubleshoot website where dummies think they must have accidentally entered a wrong password. 
Please don't ever click a link to check your account, type it in a browser to check yourself.
