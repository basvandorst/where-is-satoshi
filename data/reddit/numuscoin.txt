I don't know how many pages the original thread was.  But this link has 14 pages or so of comments.    I have no way of knowing what gets deleted on that forum etc.

This appears to be it.

Check out the ATM fees...then try to hold back those tears ;-)
Kidding.  Congrats on getting a local ATM - very cool.

With paper/brain wallets etc - banning it would be impossible.
They can, however, make it extremely unattractive by enforcing all kinds of regulations on the trade/exchange of it.   Can impose onerous tax form filing for each transaction etc.   Essentially regulate it back onto the dark web.
All of which would cause it to drop huge.

There's so many fake hundreds floating around, that's not exactly the best reason to bail on cash and wish for bitcoin.
Have 80 people behind you in line while you pay and wait 75 minutes for the blockchain confirmation before the store lets you leave with the dolls.    
There's solutions for the bitcoin issue, just like the issue for you is to carry around some 20's.

"ignorance of his parents"
"don't trust his girlfriend"
Now you want to spy on the address to make sure the parents don't spend it.
Why not use [
This way you don't have to worry about your friends (who you call ignorant)
Bonus:  You don't have to expose yourself as being a douche through reddit.

It's on the high end - but not unheard of.

Website is only 2 months old (even though their site says 2017-2019) - that's a red flag (for me)
The images from the testimonials appear to have just been grabbed from other sites and cropped.  (Besides, who volunteers their photo to a crypto site to vouch for it?)
Paying above market - monster red flag to me combined with the other stuff.
Seems scammy to me

For me, my dislike developed in 2017 with the big run.   Not because I didn't own any bitcoin, but because it seemed to be (up until that point) being adopted by real world stores etc.  There were coffee shops and even a dentist in my city who accepted bitcoin.
Then the price skyrocketed, and so did the fees.  Suddenly the reality that the fee to pay for the coffee would be  more than the coffee itself showed the impracticality of small purchases.
Along the same note, I dislike the real world use where you need to be using a lightning wallet or something for retailers, otherwise you can just stand in line and wait 2 minutes...or 75 minutes for the first confirmation, before the transaction might be deemed real.

Quite the air-drop.

Do you have any experience/opinion on these charities?

Free to use...if you have an expired job to promote

Does your friend hate poor photoshops?  Because of he does, you nailed it.
