Crypto is information. They will do what they can to control and divide the people. But, like the internet, crypto is borderless and almost boundless information. The same with drugs and anything else illegal, the sheep will comply, those who live free continue to do their thing.

Great idea. You should totally mortgage your parent's house while you're at it.

Basically what i tell my friends new to bc.
Bought a little at about 120. Bought a LOT at 1,200. HODLing ever since. I only skim a little to get the mrs some fancies.

All my old friends calling me up since they figured I'm making bank, having told them about bc years back.

Wait. Buy some more. Wait some more.
One of two things will happen. It either becomes the next google or the next myspace. For now, put it in and wait...

Wait for the IPO. Dump the high price on the normies. 3 weeks after. Walk out with ca$h.

Your main problem is that you are HOLDING, and not HODLing.
That there tells us all we need to know.

WHEN TO CONSIDER THE BITCOIN DROP...
Early next year the markets should begin adjusting to this, the longest bearish market in history.
If the tax break is approved, this bearish market will continue for now. If the tax break doesn't fly, the markets will begin to adjust. 
When all these people ignorantly buying btc on credit cards etc, will need to liquify their assets. This will bring a huge drop in price. 
KEEP AN EYE OUT PPL. PLZ.

Not true. I bought months back. At around 1,200. So yeah, it's been pretty sweet.

If you are getting in now i dunno what to say.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:24:17
Nah. I started with a few hundred. I'm at a couple thounsand. Took some out to buy myself a nice, heavy gold watch to remind myself this fake money just got me a very real watch, and I can do anything.

A bubble it is. But when it will pop and how low it will go is yet to be seen.
