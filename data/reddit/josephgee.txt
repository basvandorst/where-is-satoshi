In math a unit that is infinitely small is called an infinitesimal, 0.000...001 with an infinite numbers of zeroes is less than an infinitesimal, it actually is identically zero. [Video](

I looked at some of the lists and maps for places that accept bitcoin, it was obvious that one place, a crepes place in Brooklyn, hadn't adjusted their rates in a while, their special was 1 crepe a sandwich and a drink for one bitcoin.

I disagree, these crashes and this volatility does hurt bitcoin, while it may not hurt bitcoin as an investment, it does hurt bitcoin as a currency. People are willing to be payed in dollars because they trust it will be worth about the same amount when they want to spend it, which isn't always long term.

I think the [ars article]( explained bitcoin and the issue pretty well.

Personally when it comes to this whole event the thing that is most important to me is that the feds went after DPR and not bitcoin. Unlike how the entertainment industry has tried to compromise the integrity of our DNS to try and stop piracy (IE SOPA), the feds didn't try to attack the bitcoin network or declare it illegal to use, they went after a single person that was using it to profit from illegal activities, and that makes me glad.

I didn't say it shouldn't be digital, I said the vast majority of money that is traded is already digital. This just isn't an advantage over traditional currency because they are both digital.
You can already send a transaction digitally to the other side of the planet with traditional currency, the advantage of bitcoin in this respect is the lack of government involvement that slow the transaction down, and the decentralized transaction confirmation system.

Thank you for these, I used the original image in a powerpoint yesterday for a school project I did on bitcoin.

Yep that was in the 7th reason in the video I linked.

One of the main points in that post is that just because an informative post gets less votes than a meme post, doesn't mean the majority actually prefer the meme, the time to create and to evaluate the posts gives the meme an advantage simply by making more of them and making them upvoted faster on /new.
If we really do want this meme content I would personally prefer a self post link method, as used on or at the very least the filter system now on @_date: 2013-05-09 16:45:16

This was my point, it's not about bitcoin being digital, it's about the other good things about it that are actually different than the currency we currently have.
You don't need to "point out the things I missed" because I wasn't building a comprehensive list of every advantage of bitcoin, simply explaining how those advantages come from differences from traditional digital currencies (like the USD), and while saying bitcoin is based on the world's largest distributed computing project may not be catchy on a poster it is a much more interesting property with more interesting implications than being digital.
Being digital is the new normal for everything we have, including our traditional currency. Being digital is expected, doesn't need to be explained, and isn't something to get excited about.

part of the issue is that even if they don't skip the wall of text, Reddit evaluates posts based on how many upvotes they have and the time its been since the posting, meaning that I read a meme in 20 seconds and upvote it, I read a post in 5 minutes and upvote it, the meme has the advantage in ranking because its getting upvotes faster.
Here is another scenario in case you don't feel the first reason makes a large difference:  Say me and a friend both read this subreddit, I only like in-depth informative pieces and he only likes memes.  So if I see a meme, I downvote automatically, and if he sees a non-image post, he automatically downvotes, we see a piece of content we usually like, we have a 3/5 chance of upvoting the post (and half the submissions are memes, half are in depth).  So since I am taking the time to read long posts in 60 minutes of redditing I upvote 6 informative posts, downvote 4 and downvote 10 memes.  Now in his 60 minutes of redditing he upvotes  30 memes, downvotes 20, and downvotes 50 informative pieces.  This creates a false representation, because while 50% of the sample group like informative content they get a net score of -48 while the meme's net score is 0.

This has been the case for quite a while now, it's not like I paid for this semester of college with paper money. There are many cool and innovative things about bitcoin, but being digital isn't really one of them.
