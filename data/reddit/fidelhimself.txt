We are seven times more likely to be killed by a police officer than a terrorist
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:52:20
According to the [Washington Post]( about 3,000 U.S. citizens died as a result of 'terrorist' attacks between 2001 and 2011. Another WP [article]( indicated that between 300 and 400 citizens are killed every year in ['Justifiable Homicides by Police.'](
WP: "U.S. federal code defines [terrorism] as 'the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.'" [This article]( reveals that the figures regarding violence committed by police are skewed and incomplete.
Obviously this is a difficult statistic to define with any certainty but since 9/11 very few U.S. citizens have been killed by so called terrorist. The real figure is probably more like you are 2000 times more likely to be killed by police on U.S. soil.

But where does the money come from considering we are 20+ trillion in debt and there is no end in sight to the endless wars of aggression - to think otherwise is pretty naive despite the fact that many politicians will promise such. And I'm not willing to put our future generations into a deeper debt hole.
I propose a truly free market without coercive taxation where we can each vote with our dollars/btc. We can protect the poor through voluntary charity like we used to. All human interactions should be voluntary!
Regardless, anonymous transaction will make taxation, governments irrelevant in 10 years so we'll have to solve our problems without government - can you imaging such a world?

You are so wrong: research corporate personhood. Without governments there is no corporation. Gov gives them equal legal standing with individuals with less liabilities. 
Governments exist to server the elite. YOU are the utopian if you think they will ever doing anything else.
@_date: 2019-03-17 06:29:36
Yea because ignorant people will always vote for 'free stuff.' A politician need only promise you someone else's money.
But what is virtuous about democracy anyway? If you and I form an island government with a third person, all I have to do is persuade that third person and we can vote to do anything to you. Democracy is opposed to minority rights for this very reason.
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:43:23
Almost everyone is outraged billionaire tax breaks, wars of aggression - what you did there is a Straw Man fallacy. I'm sorry to disillusion you but the government exists to benefit the elite. Giving them more power to tax us is only to increase the evils they commit. Politicians will say whatever it takes to get elected. We don't need coercive murderous governments to solve our problems, we are not children.

Spoken like a true victim of government propaganda. I can show you my contract with Sprint, Google etc. can you show me our contract with the US government? 
Can you even answer the question I asked or are you going to keep avoiding my questions? Philosophically where does the government get it's right to steal from our income? Then steal from our purchasing power? Then steal from our right to own property through a yearly tax on the home, car, etc we have purchased and paid tax on?
Are you creative enough to find solutions to problems that don't require stealing from your neighbor?
Are you so blinded by partisan politics that you cannot even criticize obama who's wars resulted in many deaths? So 'Iraq and Afghanistan started 5 years before' - what kind of excuse is that you war hawk? He was in office for 8 years.

You cannot put into your own words how the government got the right to tax us because you are an authoritarian boot licker responsible for promoting the subjugation of the human race. You assume I'm uniformed but you cannot even answer as simple question: **You and I have no right to tax the income of our neighbors so how can we give that right to a politician through voting?**
We have the technology to replace government function with cryptocurrencies and smart contracts so there is absolutely no excuse to coerce participation in a violent government under threat of imprisonment, theft of private property. Regardless of your philosophy from 'hundreds of years ago', cryptocurrencies will make taxation, governments irrelevant within 10 years - then how will you force people to pay for your backwards policies? You'll just have to learn how to win a debate and convince people you're right I guess.
Sex without consent is rape.

No. Regulation is always in favor of the the elite. 
Think of it this way. Your income is taxed to subsidize sugar cane production in the US. And what do you get in return? Destroyed ecosystems and crony-capitalism, nepotism + major profits for the few.  In a free market the sugar producers must appeal to the consumers and therefore must provide more value. In the current system we have no choice whether or not we support them. 
Military Industrial complex is an order of magnitude worse but we have no ability to say "I don't want my tax dollar spend on foreign aggression." More importantly this opens up the military to dangerous influence from outside our borders.
In a free market we vote with our spending. No one is forced to pay for military, sugar, imprisonment of nonviolent drug users, etc.... In a free market only those who provide value are funded. 
At the top of the pyramid are the banksters who can inflate your saved USD to the point to no value. There is nothing you can do to resist. They have to power to halt the entire economy if they wish. We cannot have a free market until we abolish central banking. Many have tried this tactic only to be assassinated. The banksters are truly the enemy, not the employers who would be taxed by UBI resulting in lower employment rates.

They will alway avoid tax, any increase would only eliminate the middle class.

Cut all welfare and return to the charity system we used to have before governments took over every aspect of our lives. Our current system actually incentives single parent households which is detrimental to the development of children.

JK Rowelling created an entire fantasy world and the economy surrounding that has employed hundreds if not thousands of people - there are all paid for their participation. Even if she drew inspiration from a book she read earlier, that author and publishing co we’re all compensated.
If it were a zero sum game there would be no technology in the world at all, only raw materials. You have no right to steal from her wealth just because you think you’re entitled.
You and I have no right to tax our neighborhoods so how can you give that right to a politician through voting? We can solve our problems without violent coercive government and if your ideas were better you wouldn’t need to enforce them.
@_date: 2019-03-17 06:11:33
And this trend will not end. So why would we increase taxes?
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:29:18
People like you feel entitled to control society from the top-down because you saw some History channel show. Your policies are literally leading to more unemployment and quickening the automation of low wage jobs. Bezos raised min wage at Whole Foods while simultaneously cutting back hours forcing employees to work harder but less hours. People like Bezos will still profit they need only to restructure and use the government against the population.
@_date: 2019-03-17 07:14:57


Competition, need for employees. Think of it this way: an unemployed black young man (historically unemployed at higher rates) desires a job to gain experience and advance his career. A local gas station owner makes little compared to the corporate competitors but can afford to pay $10/hour to a kid with no prior experience. Both agree to the arrangement. 
By creating minimum wage laws you are in fact preventing that job being filled. If the gas station owner is forced to pay $15/hour he must either implement automation, work extra hours or go out of business. So who are you to prevent that mutually agreed upon relationship? You are actually incentivizing automation and unemployment of the lower class.

I voted for Obama and even campaigned for him during his first run when I was still young am naive. Since his term in office - at war longer than another president before him, only president to be at war every day of two term - I have voted Libertarian, Independent and Republican. In general I vote for smaller government because government is just the largest gang in a geographical region, with a monopoly on violent force. Philosophically I'm partial to the argument that voting in general is an immoral way to control a society - two wolves and a sheep deciding whats for dinner regardless of individual liberties. Politics is not as basic a R vs D.
Let me ask you this, **if you and I have no right to tax our neighbor's income, how can we give that right to a politician through voting?**
