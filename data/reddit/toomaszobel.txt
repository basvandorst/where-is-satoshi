Think of all the companies that are on the EEA developing their own use cases using Solidity. Once RSK is out do you think they will all jump ship to Bitcoin - bare in mind they don't care about Bitcoin completely impartial towards cryptos's and what is "the founding father", all major companies care about is how easy it will be to use, **stability**, effort required to switch platform vs economic/use case gain.
Notice how I highlighted stability there. Do you really think major corporations want to transition to a blockchain that is so unstable it has to fork 2x a year, creating a mini crisis and the communities can't reach consensus on which direction to take the project in, **miners** want to manipulate things to maximise their profits.
Now lets get to the mining part, because by around 2020-2021 It has been estimated that with current electricity usage growth BTC would need to use the equivalent of current world electricity use to allow miners to verify transactions. First off, even with current use and with global warming being so high on the agenda, why would corporations make unnecessary changes for absolutely no reason, while also ETH being more environmentally friendly (PoS coming sometime this year).
The mining issue is a huge one, Bitcoin has been the pioneer and I am thankful for all that it has done for blockchain, but with electricity use spiking so much it's a matter of time until the point where electricity usage for work done exceeds the ability of miners to make profit. Once this barrier has been crossed you can't verify transactions and there is no sidechain solution, only a hard fork - and you know how well they turn out and how long they take...

When something sounds too good to be true...so what's to stop people from exploiting this to spam transactions?
