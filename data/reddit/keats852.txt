Don't worry there will be a homeless guy standing around to explain to people what the clock does.. for a small tip.

Tipping is going to be a major thing in the future. They need to allow tipping for YouTube etc etc..

It's only sending me a message that bitcoin owners are wasteful schmucks.

This is ridiculous. I can't even afford to pay my electricity bill, and you guys are smashing iPhones and bragging about it. My 4 year old phone doesn't even play MP3s anymore. If you want to break the phones, please disassemble them and send them to me, so that I can sell the parts.

Actually a lot of people who have been holding their BTC might start selling if the price keeps going up like crazy. With only 35% chance of approval, I would sell all my BTC on the 10th of March, and buy it back a week later. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:45:41
If the price is really going to balloon after it gets approved, then they should approve it asap. It's only going to blow up bigger if they wait. 
Another good reason to approve: They should try to keep as much BTC as possible American. The way to do that is to get it traded on a major US exchange where it can easily be bought by any American investor.

Thanks for the gold! BY FAR the worst part about this whole ordeal for me was that nobody seemed to believe me. People look at you like you're a criminal when you tell them. Even friends, co-workers and family members will think that it was YOU, not the system, that did something wrong. That's how well-rooted their belief in the system is, even when it's wrong. In many ways it was a huge wake-up call. It's probably better not to tell anybody you know, or you can tell them and find out where their loyalties are. The look in people's eyes when I told them is something I will never forget. Suddenly I was a criminal. 
I think it took like 4 to 6 weeks for me to get it sorted out. I could not open bank accounts, use any kind of card or whatever. I did my research online and ent out the right letters, documented everything, and I was ready to fight them in court. In the end, they sent me a letter that they cleared my SSN. 
Good luck! I hope you can get this sorted out soon!

Obviously after the recent news, everybody's going to pull out their btc from Coinbase?

New graphs that predict that Bitcoin is going to go to the moon next year show up every once in a while... there's always some mathematical philosophy behind it, but it never seems to work out! 
I want to believe, but in the end it's Time that will take us to heaven.

Actually, it's not that uncommon. There's an external agency called ChexSystems that keeps track of your personal information. As soon as some financial institution reports something like "Fraudulent Activity", all the other financial institutions get notified and they do, in fact, close down your account. They will send you a check in the mail with your balance on it, and you won't be able to open an account anywhere. It happened to me 6 years ago when I opened an online trading account at E*Trade. For whatever reason they reported me, and Chase closed me down without any warning. Calling support is useless. Nobody will even tell you what's going on. In the end I went to CITI bank, who were unable to open an account for me after they checked my SSN against ChexSystems. They told me to call my lawyer. Fortunately, there are standard letters that you can send out to ChexSystems to get the "Fraudulent Activity" removed from your account if they can't prove what it was. 
Basically, OP is right and yes it can happen to anyone. He's just getting downvoted because the general public doesn't know how it works. I tried reaching out to E*Trade, but there's no point. I even went to their corporate HQ here in NY, but nobody knows anything.

The blockchain is here to stay, and Bitcoin is running on the oldest one. There's only 21 million coins ever. 
It'll go back up. 
I tell all my friends and family to buy at least 1 BTC.

You should start selling these. Seriously.

I think you just have no idea what it means to be a man. Maybe you should try imagining what it is to be one. All this bullshit about "the patriarchy" and feminism is just dividing society. There's a reason why men commit suicide more often, why there are more men in jail, why they don't live as long, why women spend all the money. You're telling me that I cherry-picked a rare situation, but the truth is; you're basing your whole worldview on that stereo-typical image of the white male in power of it all. All that work that you would NEVER want to do is all done by men. Take a look around next time you go outside. You should try 50 jobs in male dominated industries before you have the right to complain about "the patriarchy" and "the society dominated by men".

Divorces happen. A lot. And the divorce courts don't exactly favor men in the USA. No matter how much you love your partner, you'd be stupid to get married these days. Did you know that if your wife gets knocked up by another man, you are still liable for child support? Basically any married woman can have sex with any random guy... as long as she's married, she'll be taken care of by her husband or ex-husband's money.  
And it gets even worse. In some states, a woman can just put down the name of any random man as being the father on the birth certificate of her child, and the man will have to prove that he's not the father.. otherwise, you guessed it: child-support.

I found my old 1 btc casascius coin in a little plastic bag in my coinjar a few weeks ago... it's now in my safe. 
I haven't checked the balance yet, I'm afraid to.

You guys are all silly. The big highs happened about 6 to 18 months after the halvenings. It took that long for the miners too sell their bitcoin reserves to power their operations. After that, supply got tighter and prices rose steadily. Now that this bull run is over, Bitcoin is slowly correcting itself like it always has. The next bull will be about a year after the next halvening. Until then, Bitcoin will slowly settle to around 15% of its ATH. 
So for all you gentlemen/ladies out there: buy Bitcoin in the next few years, as much as you can. The next ATH will be 180K.

Oh shit, it's almost as if some poor guy in Africa/India invented Bitcoin just to get WU to lower their fees. In the end, Bitcoin has benefited poor people the most!

I think Transferwise is quite expensive, I used them the other day but won't use them again because they charge like 1%. Might as well use a bank. HiFx is supposedly cheaper for larger amounts of money, but they need all your information including passport, SSN, job, employer, name of your dog, length of your toenails. Ridiculous if you just want to quickly transfer some money. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 13:58:33
Regular people would use Coinbase or something similar which charges like 1% to buy, and then another 1% to sell (the numbers might be off). My point is, regular people will still be paying very high fees. The whole idea that "Bitcoin does away with bank fees" is no longer really valid. As soon as you tie services to a product, you'll end up paying fees whether you want to or not. If I need to transfer money from Europe to the USA, I use Transferwise. A BTC conversion is too expesnive.

Can they be trusted to load BTC onto those coins? Would those coins be a good investment?

I wonder if bitcoin can be expected to go up in value in the short term. Have the miners in China been selling most of their bitcoins to sustain their operations, or have they been stockpiling (in the last few years)? If they have been stockpiling, are they now selling off some of their coins to keep their operations going? Or do they still don't need to? Is the price of bitcoin going to go up once we can really feel the shortage of coins due to the halving? And if that's going to happen, when is it going to be? A year from now? Two years from now?

Yea I'll try to contact the seller directly if Bitcoin.de stays silent.

The only reason for you to give away bitcoins is because right now, too many bitcoins reside with too few people. You need to create wider user acceptance to make it a viable currency in the future. It's the only way to create real value for your coins. Basically, you're giving away bitcoins for your own future success :-) Don't think the smarter people don't know how the system works =) If you ask me, you're not even giving away enough of them. Cash in now, sell them off bit by bit for dollars, and diversify. It only takes one idiot selling off 50000 bitcoins for the whole system to come crashing down. Nothing ever lasts on the Internet, the next big e-currency is probably already being developed.

Well yea I contact Bitcoin.de... but they've been silent so far.

While the comment is true, it's kind a weird to make a new post about it. These are things people need to find out for themselves (if they haven't already), or need find for themselves while browsing for more information about Bitcoin. 
Looking for information about something is a journey in itself, it prepares your mind for what's about to come. Your brain is making a relational database as you search for information and find the pieces one by one. 
Here, have an upvote for letting me put in to words what I've known all along :-)

For somebody who doesn't understand what it is, she did really well trying to wrap her mind around it. She asked the right questions, and she wasn't judgemental about it.
