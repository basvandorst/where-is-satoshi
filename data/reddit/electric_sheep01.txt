This guy is an idiot. He also thinks anything but bitcoin is 100% a scam among other questionable ideas. I’d stay away from his advice personally.

Many altcoins are in their own niche and are not direct competitors to BTC

Average users don't care, and for adoption shouldn't have to care, about being technically accurate. If you think everyone is going to understand all the technical details of cryptocurrencies when they get heavily adopted you overestimate people's capacity to care. No one is whining, people just hit a walls of complexity and leave it at that, never diving deeper because the initial learning curve is too steep. If you have simple on-boarding tactics people will appreciate the technology and more likely dive into the technical side once they realize how great cryptocurrency is. 
Mnemonic seeds was a term coined by the cryptocurrency community and isn't exactly 'technical terminology.' Referring to it as a master key still communicates the same concept of how a HD BIP39 seed technically works but in an easier to understand manner that more average people can relate to, everyone knows what a real world master key is and how they work - simply put, It isn't wishy-washy bs language it can still be used in a technical manner and the term mnemonic just adds unnecessary complexity. 
Referring to it as your master key also helps grasp the concept of what a private key does as again, people can relate to keys and master keys being used in the real world. I agree that referring to private keys as keys and public keys simple as addresses may not be a great idea hence why I added it as an afterthought and not in the title of the post. But nonetheless, I think changing how those aspects of crypto community are communicated helps adoption with the average Joe who isn't / doesn't want to be technical in the slightest. 
Next time you meet someone who is not technically minded try explain to them how a seed works technically using both mnemonic/seed terminology followed by master key terminology and see which they grasp quicker. I guarantee master key will be reciprocated better, I've been educating in the crypto space for some years now so can attest to this.

Appreciate the in-depth, well thought out reply - thanks. 
You say it as if you decide for the community, thats not how Bitcoin works bud hence why I said 'proposal.'

You don’t have to encrypt your Mnemonic, this is actually an advanced option and most do not use it.

For communicating to the lay man calling it a Master Key intuitively explains what it does as does Recovery phrase which is also a good term but I prefer master key as it keeps things streamlined when learning when discussing public / private / master key
Why? A good UX users shouldn’t even know the private key exists, for simplicity sake just saying “you phone wallet stores the keys to your wallet locally” 
My mistake with the public key I’ll edit my original post !

Get your bitcoin fork claims. 
Keep some as an investment
Invest in some other crypto’s (Monero ����) 
cash out and invest majority in property / index’s
It might seem like a lot of money but it really isn’t and could be burnt through very fast, why the Tesla, top of the range model will be around 25% of the bag, is it really worth that ?

And what the internet did to information sharing I see digital currencies having similar impacts, if not more, on how the world transacts value in general.

How do you guys collect your fee with this multisig method? 
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:02:04
What if the fee you collect is less than the network fee to send the BTC to the buyers address?

Any iOS? Thanks for those I’ll try out Wasabi
