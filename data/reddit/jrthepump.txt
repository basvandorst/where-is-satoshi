This dude the reason btc not taken seriously yet
@_date: 2019-10-31 03:15:17
This doesn’t mean it’s necessarily Bitcoin replacing it. It’s just more electronic transactions will replace paper ones ����‍♂️

I hope bitcoin soars to the moon, but at some point people want realized gains and that’s where the problem lies.
@_date: 2019-10-31 03:16:56
I love bitcoin but sometimes I feel like I have to dad dick this sub’s wishful thinking
@_date: 2019-06-13 01:06:12
Also inflation isn’t bad if it’s stays in a certain range. Come on guys

Everyone please downvote my last comment I actually thought that shit was hilarious 
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:04:44
To your second question, If this wasn’t obvious to people when they were trashing bitcoin, those people don’t know how this world works.

Anyone get happier the more this drops? Opportunity to bank when it shoots back up 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:48:23
I am

Just bought more so you guys should hold off to buy when it drops more 
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:50:37
Just remember, your investment can never go down to 0

There’s nothing controversial about it all you’re doing is splitting the investment up in pieces albeit you potentially sacrifice higher return for risk protection.

No use in arguing with fanboys. I’m positive Bitcoin will do alright and I’m invested, but past performance is literally one of the first no-nos in investing. Ignorance is bliss. I’m a former financial advisor and an MBA, maybe I don’t know what I’m talking about ��

You speak for everyone. /s
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:30:33
This is why you gone lose money.
@_date: 2019-09-26 21:33:44
of course you look at charts, but if past performance is used in any way as a leading argument for your point then RIP in your trading account. i believe a few others in the thread have outlined the more relevant factors in evaluating an assets potential. 
Not guaranteeing past performance indicates future results isn't heuristic advice, its literally against FINRA regulations to sell an equity this way. It must be disclosed.

This means nothing
