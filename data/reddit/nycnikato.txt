It is Tuesday morning and I'm still waiting. If I can have my coins by wednesday I suppose I will be satisfied.

There has to be a  service guarantee. If you tell people it could take up to2 business days for their orders to process ,this will give them a realistic expectation.  Don't make people believe that if they upload their receipt on Saturday  that they will have it on Tuesday. Honestly, as soon as cash is deposited to a credit union,the transaction will be visible on your side. You also know that a cash transaction at a credit union will not be reversed.

This issue has ben FIXED!!

I will just have to make sure to send bitcoin to my wallet and then convert over to blackcoin. No biggie I suppose. but still a crucial bug.

honestly, these unreasonable regulations are workable. vendors would keep transaction info for 10 years and report all the suspicios ones. , which is just an expansion of federal requirements. Businesses also would not be able to keep profit in boitcoin. simply tell coinbase to cash out nightly. Keeping reserves in cash to cover transactions is also workable. This is where a bank would come in.

I put a lot of faith in expresscoin.  I had a little issue over slow processing time with my initial order. They finally filled my order so I thought I would place another order. I placed my order ealy saturday morning. The CEO promised me that they work on weekends. If they do it is a surprise to me.

My deposit was received 2 days ago. It was on Saturday so I understand. It is like I made my request on a Monday. Great news, It is now Tuesday and my Coins have arrived!!! Great service. I will however be using Holy Transaction until Expresscoin starts accepting Blackcoin.

Blackcoin is better because they is no risk of 51 percent attack, and blackcoins don't need to be mined, they can be given as a reward for mining other coins. There are many other mostly technical reasons, but I have told you what I know.

I did notice one bug in the Holytransaction website. When you send blackcoins from external addressed to your wallet, they may not show up. They are still in the blockchan they just don't show up where you can access them in Holytransaction, they are essentially in limbo, until Holytransaction fixes their algorithm for displaying blackcoin from external sources. They overly simplify the interface by hiding your private key from you. This is done for security reasons. However, when something as unusual as this occurs, it would be good to have your private key.

It is entirely too hard to figure out how to buy bitcoin in cash easily. Hopefully this website helps people.

Selling Bitcoin from the state of Indiana, from a 3 bedroom house,  with no money transmitter license, and no actual bitcoins to provide, is a recipe for disaster.  They will take your credit card number and process it, and then they will make you sign a form that says you must wait up to 8 days for bitcoin. If you use a bank or prepaid debit card you are SCREWED!!!  Finally, they will send you a form saying that due to a suddenly new dispute with their credit card processor for the month of (your month of purchase here ) , that you bitcoin order will have to wait another 2 weeks. It is all very fishy. Avoid Kedia like the plague.
Their website Kedia.co, they say they "love bitcoin"  I'm sure they do, as it opens up great fraud opportunities for them. If you do choose to do business with them, use Escrow. I'm sure they will send you a long letter saying why you should not use escrow.

They don't and cant' justify it. Not one card shipped, no knowledge of who the netwark partner is, and also no knowledge of the fee structure.

This issue has been resolved. My blackcoins are no longer in the abyss. I tried sending more blackcoins and they were in my account instantly.

If it is still not resolved, you may have to bring out the big guns. List them on bittrust.org

Not a good service. I tried to register my Credit Card with their service. They could not explain why it would not work. A month later they suspended my account. For absolutely no reason. So glad to be rid of them. So happy with coinbase.
