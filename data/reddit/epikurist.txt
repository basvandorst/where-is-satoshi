If you're long on bitcoin and you hodl and want your bitcoin to appreciate in the future, then lending it to a company which will sell them right away doesn't make sense. Try to understand *rehypothecation* and look that term up in their terms of use ;-)

Good luck proving that this btc was bought legally in a few years when you want to cash out even a tiny fraction ;-)

Sure you can sell it there and even better that you get a higher price.
The point I come from is when you buy say 0,2 BTC as anonymous as possible and those BTCs few years later are worth above 20k then you will have a problem receiving the money from your sell on any bank account, because every bank is required to run anti-money laundering practice which typically starts around 15-20k. So the bank will freeze this amount and without prove of funds the money will not be available to you.
One could argue, that you can  try to get this money from a local seller in cash. But this involves a huge amount of risk since you have to meet the seller personally and would be very easy for people to rip you off when they know you'll come with a huge amount of BTC. You could also just don't sell your bitcoin and  try to spend it, but only time will tell if this will easily possible. Especially with companies like Chainalysis which already provide green-lighting services.
So to put things short I think living in a major developed country it's almost always better to buy your bitcoin through a regulated exchange, so you can prove that you bought it legally. There have been lots of people who bought bitcoin in the early days and because of it having no value back then they didn't think of prove of funds and had major headaches selling some of their holdings for a house or diversification.

You might want to get some down-to-earth insights into this. You're not wrong, it's not scientifically proven that mild deflation is a bad thing.

Don't invest in anything you don't understand and understand that it adds a multitude of different risks to your holdings.
And if you hodl it's also not a good idea to give people your bitcoin to sell it:
