good question - I think in the short term they are good as more money is being pumped into crypto and once people get tired of their altcoins failing to boom they will move this to BTC.
However, with a long term view there will be some altcoins that do very well and mean that money moves away from BTC.

As it is quite a long video, I will post the below so you can watch whatever section interests you :) :
1:21 - The Bitcoin Boom and what it means for altcoins 3:28 - ICOs: where will it all end? 5:18 - How does Bitcoin differ from other coins/distinguishing features? 7:38 - Our thoughts on Steemit and Steem 11:08 - Too late to buy Bitcoin?

hmmm to be honest I think it will make little difference - the key thing about BTC and cryptos in general is that they are ALL in their infancy.
This is despite BTC seeming mature due to recent price boomts, they are still not mainstream! 
My advice: do your research and determine whether it would be best to buy before or after BUT realise that it won't really make a difference if you are planning to keep it for next 5-10 years anyway.

I just thought this would be a good post in case anyone is thinking that it is "too late" to get into Bitcoin! Cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy and all have a long way to go, however this does not mean that Bitcoin will definitely be the market leader forever.
In the video we discuss the Bitcoin boom and what this could mean for altcoins.

so true! haha love the video but the message behind it is serious!
people need to think long-term with Crypto (and investments in general)... ain't no pump and dump!!
