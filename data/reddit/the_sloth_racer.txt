Unfortunately, Gemini, Kraken, and GDax **STILL** won't/haven't verified my identity and I've been trying for maybe 2 months or so on Gemini with no update. I've been waiting on Kraken too. GDax won't verify me at all no matter how many ways I try to confirm my identity, it says my info is wrong. Coinbase is the only place I can trade on.

What was the BitConnect scam?

Yeah, I sent them an email about a week ago and all they said was there was a lot of people signing up and to wait. Not really any help.

I really think you should consider donating to a true autism charity like the [Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation for Autism]( or [Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN)]( Both help families and those with autism and aren't giant multi-million dollar "non-profits" like some claim to be. 
If you prefer larger charities, I would recommend donating to a mental health charity because the mental healthcare system in the US is beyond broken. People across the US with mental health issues need help and can't get it. Please consider donating to [National Alliance Mental (NAMI)]( or [Mental Health America (MHA)](
