If the average consumer is connected to two hubs (lets say VISAHUB and PAYPALHUB) and the US government tells visa and paypal (and other large providers) to close their channels to wikileaks and any other hub that has channels to wikileaks. Will users pay the $20 it takes to establish yet another channel with a hub that refuses to block wikileaks? I know the payments can hop, I'm telling you the government could target large hubs and reduce the convenience/increase the cost of transacting with entities it wants to squelch. On Bitcoin Cash the transaction fees are a few cents and there's no way for the government to shut it down unless they try to take down the whole network.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:23:15
They might. The issue I've noticed since segwit was introduced is one of adoption/implementation. They'll lower fees if they are used. Adoption for SegWit's been pretty slow, LN would be even slower since it's a totally different software. Increasing the blocksize fixes the current problem and buys time for these other solutions to kick in (I suported SegWit2x).

Funds, not nodes.


You mean like hubs?
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:58:13
Ok, so we don't go into an endless loop. "We noticed you **or someone you have a channel to** has a channel to Wikileaks. We've been ordered to stop transactions to Wikileaks and because of the way LN works, some of these transactions are currently going through your channel. We ask that you please close your channel to Wikileaks or we'll be forced to close our channel to you. Thank you for your time, VISA/Paypal/etc" That hub will send a similar email to whatever user has the channel and so on and so forth. 
You seem unaware that we're talking about something [that already happened]( Very few people left those services then, and few would leave them if something similar happened in the future. They have the following leverage:
1. Cognitive/time cost of finding new hub widely accepted in your area *who is not also blocking Wikileaks*
2. Transaction fee of closing the current channel
3. Transaction fee of opening a new channel
More than 80% of users won't even notice it is happening. Of the remaining 20% less than half will research for new hubs. Less than half of those will go through with it and switch hubs.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:06:02
The US updates the money transmitter laws to apply to LN hubs above a certain size that are located or have operations in the US. Then they lean on the money transmitters to close their channels to Wikileaks. That won't stop 100% of the funds, but it will deter a large chunk of people from donating (because they don't want to pay the 20 bucks, because they don't have the time to setup another channel, because it's inconvenient, take your pick). That will put pressure on Wikileaks not to keep publishing US secrets. With on-chain scaling there's absolutely nothing the government can do to stop the payments.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:27:56


VISA will shut down channels that keep a channel to Wikileaks. Or (if they are large enough) the US government will lean on them to shut their channels to Wikileaks. 
Hubs benefit from economies of scale. The more channels a hub has, the cheaper it is for users to transact (fewer hops) and the fewer channels a person needs to maintain. LN might lower the barrier to entry but the big players will continue to have an advantage.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:32:30
I don't want it to fail, I have some bitcoin, I just don't see how it will succeed. Everything I've read tells me people will just have a channel with the Paypal hub and a channel with the VISA hub and we'll essentially have the same financial infrastructure as before, just on Bitcoin instead of USD.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:36:22
Each step in the chain gets a fee though right? Wouldn't a single entity who has channels with millions of people be the cheapest way to use the LN for the average user?
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:50:04
Are you familiar with how economic sanctions work? US hubs would have to shut down channels to Wikileaks *and* hubs that have channels with wikileaks. So foreign hubs with big ties to US commerce would have to shut their channels too. They are never water-tight, but if they cut off 60-90% of funds they are effective. Not to mention opening a new channel means using the blockchain which has fees of like 20 bucks now? I just don't see a lot of folks paying 20 bucks to donate another 20 bucks on top of that.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:50:22


So UnionPayHUB is going to have a channel to the corner store near my house? (Do you even know what UnionPay is?)


Again, not unusable, just unable to send money to Wikileaks.


Every node can reach every other node in the network *it has a channel to*. So VISAHUB informs nodes with channels to Wikileaks that they are going to close the hub-node channel unless the node breaks the node-wikileaks channel. Yes, on the testnet where economic considerations are non-existent everyone is connected to everyone. In the real world, the hubs with the largest number of direct channels, the best uptime, and the fastest connections will gobble up most of the market share. 
Edit: Y'know, I don't know why I'm arguing with you. Good luck with BTC!
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:04:53
It depends on what you think Bitcoin is for. Many people joined because it was meant to be "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" and feel betrayed because with such high fees it is not possible to use it as such. Other folks think it should be used a settlement layer where most transactions happen elsewhere and then organizations add them up and settle their accounts on the blockchain.
It's significant that it has exceeded the block reward because the block reward subsidizes transactions which helps drive adoption. Now that the fees are this high we might see slower adoption and merchants dropping it (such as [Valve]( There's other options with larger blocks and lower fees but I'll get banned if I talk about it on here :/
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:30:34
Unfortunately, most people don't really care if a service screws over some of their customers. When PayPal shut down Wikileak's donations people were angry but there wasn't much they could do. Then Wikileaks started accepting Bitcoin and people were able to donate through it. What happens when the US government says "all hubs have to shut down their channels to Wikileaks"?
Also, the answer is not "switch to another hub." We could have switched to other payment platforms at the time but few people are going to do that just for one donation.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:08:52


So millions of private individuals will run a Bitcoin Core node, but the won't actually transact using that blockchain, they'll instead use the LN. Why are they running a node again? But to answer your question, the US government doesn't currently have legislation to shut down nodes because they don't transmit money. They can try shutting nodes down but as long as the network is up anyone will be able to send BCH to anyone else without having to pay extra to "open a channel" or some other nonsense.


It becomes unavailable on the Bitcoin blockchain and it becomes available on the LN because it's held in (essentially) escrow. So I can use it to pay whoever also uses the LN. If they use Bitcoin but they don't use LN, then I can't pay them with the funds in LN, I'll have to use BTC instead. Not not the BTC I put in the LN, because those are still lockup up there.


"Bitcoin Core would work if everyone would just stop using Bitcoin Core"


Actually, they refused to implement Segregated Witness which from what I understand is a requirement to using LN so they could not "rip off" (good lord do you even know how open source works?) Bitcoin Core until they implement that. I'm still researching why they refuse to implement it, from what I read it seems like a reasonable solution but I don't know the details around it.

What is the cost of that transaction going through three different hubs vs the cost of a transaction going through a single hub? Follow up question, how many hubs to you expect the average consumer to have channels with?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:04:27
I care about a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Bitcoin Core is turning into a settlement layer so people are forced to use Blockstream's "second layer" solution. If you don't care about centralization and just want really cheap fees and confirmations, use the Lightning Network. Except, y'know, it doesn't exist.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:46:33
So you think the average person will have a VISAHUB channel and a PUBLIXHUB channel? If that's the case, Publix will have to abide by the US's money-transmitter regulations. When the US says "money transmitters have to close their channels to wikileaks" that will include Visa and Publix. Then your average person will be stuck having to find a new channel all over again (which most people won't do, they'll just keep using those two channels). They don't have to take down the whole network, they just have to mildly inconvenience a few large hubs.
If Bitcoin Core accomplishes what the Blockstream people hope, on-chain transactions would be even higher. The SWIFT network handles 15 million transactions a day. That's 174 transactions per second. Bitcoin Core currently handles 4 transactions per second. From what I've read SegWit would reduce transaction costs by ~40% so that's... 2 more transactions per second? Unless Blockstream increases their block size, Bitcoin Core is dead. Bitcoin Cash could handle Bitcoin Core's current transaction volume easily. They'll continue to find ways to scale.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:14:25
No, they'll just have to send an email saying "We noticed you have a channel to Wikileaks. We've been ordered to stop transactions to Wikileaks and because of the way LN works, some of these transactions are currently going through your channel. We ask that you please close your channel to Wikileaks or we'll be forced to close our channel to you. Thank you for your time, VISA/Paypal/etc"
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:03:22
Right. So wouldn't we end up with the "visa hub", the "american express hub", and the "paypal hub"? Would the hubs be able to freeze funds in channels opened with them?

Good luck paying 50 bucks for the privilege of locking up your coins into a channel
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:04:06


It seems this is the part you don't understand. The US government won't take down VISAHUB. They'll tell VISA to close their channel to Wikileaks and any other channels connected to it. For the millions of people using VISAHUB nothing will change. For the few who used it to donate to wikileaks they won't be able to do it through them, but they'll still be able to do all their other transactions. Like we already established, the average user will only keep a couple of channels open. This would force the Wikileaks supporter to try finding another hub that hasn't locked out Wikileaks but also has channels to their usual shops. "Random freedom activists" might run their own nodes, but their channels probably won't include the shops the donators usually frequent. Stores won't run their own hubs because then they'll have to abide by the money transmitter rules. They'll just have channels with the money transmitters (paypal, visa, etc). Each additional channel a person uses is an extra cost in transaction fees discouraging some people from opening yet another channel just to donate to Wikileaks. If enough people get discouraged the USG has achieved what it wanted to without having to shut the network or inconvenience most users out there.

I'm in this thread because I am researching it and everything I see tells me LN is essentially checking accounts for Bitcoin. "Here, lock up a huge chunk of BTC with this hub (because the fees are prohibitive to opening several channels) and then you can spend it with everyone they have a channel with." I wanted SegWit2x. Now that the coins split I'm looking at which one is more likely to thrive. I agree the blocks can't grow indefinitely, but as far as I can tell Blockstream is strangling on-chain scaling to create the need for their solution. Hopefully the Bitcoin Cash developers are looking at scaling options that don't increase the block size. Who will run nodes when the blocks are moderately larger? Businesses who want customers to broadcast their transactions directly to them to make paying faster. There'll be a Publix node, a Walmart node, an Exxon node, a Wendy's node, bar-down-the-street node, etc.

But Bitcoin is not trying to solve the "capital tied down" problem. Bitcoin solves the trust (and cost) problems of so many intermediaries. 
Instead of having to go through several hoops to trade goods internationally, the buyer and the seller instead use bitcoin and an escrow service at a much lower price than the current system. The bitcoins sort of sit on the blockchain until two of the three escrow participants verify the goods were shipped (or not).
@_date: 2015-06-17 04:19:08

Reposted from [Link to the paper since the article doesn't provide one]( I haven't read the paper but the article seems to give a decent summary even if he goes off the deep-end halfway through.
Both the OECD and the author get some right and a lot wrong. Bitcoin will run parallel to the fiat currency systems for a long long time to a large extent because of taxes. Governments have the ability to tax, not because they "make" the money, but because they have the monopoly on violence within a given geographical area. Bitcoin doesn't change that. 
The IRS doesn't care if you accrue wealth in Euros, Dollars, or bitcoins, it will still tax you if you are within the US or if you are a US citizen. Moreover, it won't accept payment in Euros, Yen, or bitcoin, the IRS only accepts payments in USD. If the article is a decent summary this segways into where the OECD is wrong.
The US, Europe, Japan, etc won't be using bitcoin as legal tender any time soon. There's a reason they're called [hard currencies]( They have generally stable currencies with well-respected central bankers and deep financial markets. The same is not true, however, of Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Argentina, and a number of other countries.
We've seen many incidents where a country faces runaway inflation and they turn to [dollarization]( as their solution. As the Bitcoin protocol matures and bitcoins become more widely adopted, we could see bitcoinization of weak currencies. Small countries could start accepting it as legal tender for taxes. The reason dollarization is not a good solution is because the country essentially imports the Fed's monetary policy. With bitcoin the "monetary policy" is already set and everyone knows what it is.
The question then becomes, what is a better monetary policy? A policy that reacts to underlying realities but may get things wrong, or a policy where people always know what to expect but may not adjust itself to other factors in the economy. My intuition leans towards the latter one but I have no proof one way or another. Now off to read that paper!

The first programmer in the world [was a woman]( There's a long history of [men taking credit]( for advances by women. I'm not saying women have invented everything, I'm just saying women have invented many things and they haven't been given their due attention as far as history goes. Not to mention it's hard to invent things when society doesn't even let you attend institutions of higher education. 
The article itself wasn't fantastic but the author's point that we need more women to get involved is true. I don't know how we'd go about it but I'm pretty sure implying women are useless and just waste money is a poor way of getting them interested in Bitcoin.

The relevant difference is not the geographic area the currency represents. The relevant difference is whether or not the US government has control over the currency. Since the USG can't control Bitcoin, it won't accept it as a form of payment.
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:58:23
I imagine it's setup to return whatever payment is made so people can get comfortable with using the currency without worrying about losing money.

But I feel like the value of Bitcoin largely comes from becoming a widely accepted currency. If it's a story of value but it is rarely transacted in how do we trust the valuation?
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:41:59
They may want to but why would people want to? Once bitcoin is ubiquitous enough why would people buy it from Coinbase instead of buying it from one another and get a better rate?
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:45:04
The rub comes at the exchange rate. It costs money to exchange fiat for btc. Maybe those costs will come down as it becomes more ubiquitous? Not sure...
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:34:03
What we're saying is eventually it won't be difficult to buy bitcoin in the US precisely because Coinbase is bringing it to more people.
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:29:11
Yea I definitely see it getting popular in developing countries before it gets popular in developed countries. I'm just not sure exactly *how* that will happen. Remittances kind of? But even with remittances the exchange rate hits them twice if they go USD -&gt; BTC -&gt; MXN.

That's what I think but I don't see clearly *how* that will happen.
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:22:27
Think of this as an on-ramp to decentralization. The company Coinbase is regulated, Bitcoin remains decentralized. As bitcoin gains wider usage the decentralization will become more apparent. People won't get their bitcoins from Coinbase, they'll buy them from a friend or a family member. Exchanges will be an option of last resort or used by organizations that need to buy large quantities at a time. (Source: This is how dollars work in Colombia.)
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:24:55
I definitely see it going the way you're saying but I'm wondering what will make it happen. Most vendors accepting bitcoin right now instantly turn it into cash. Maybe if more people got the option of getting paid in bitcoin? Even then, if I got the option to get paid in bitcoin I'd keep them for savings and use my USD for buying things.
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:50:07
But why would someone tie up their bitcoins in coinbase instead of sending them directly from the wallet on their phone?
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:34:05
Totally agreed. The acceptance of bitcoin in the Phillipines is picking up so I can sort of see the not having to exchange them back to pesos. Why would the employers pay their employees in bitcoin? (keep in mind many are domestic workers)
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:35:43
I'm not asking why, I'm asking how. Like, if I got paid in bitcoin I'd be more willing to spend them. But if I got paid part in USD and part in bitcoin I'd spend the USD and save the BTC because they are less likely to lose their value than the USD. But then if we all do that then the value of BTC is lower. It's a weird chicken and egg scenario.
@_date: 2015-01-28 03:40:50
Yea, I'm still trying to figure out the economics on how it will become widely used. Like, why someone would buy bitcoins and then use them to buy another thing. Like, if I bought bitcoins it'd be to hold them not spend them. If we all do that then how will it become a widely used currency. Maybe remittances will make them mainstream in developing countries and eventually tourism and trade will make them mainstream elsewhere? I haven't come to a satisfactory conclusion so that's why I haven't bought any :/.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:22:27
I might be mistaken on this but it was my understanding miners would control the max size of the block, but the actual size of the block would still be determined by the number of transactions? As in, the miner could choose to set the max to peta- or exa-bytes but if there's not enough transactions for the block to be that large then it'll just be whatever size is required to add the last 10 minutes worth of transactions.

Gotta agree here. I known economists don't have a great rep but we have some good tools to think about some of these problems. Unfortunately I don't know of any "Bitcoin economists."
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:52:49
Haha now I have you tagged as "Bitcoin economist." But yea, the economics (and lets be real, politics) of Bitcoin is getting papered over by trying to have a 100% "technical" conversation about it. I searched on Google scholar and found [this paper]( so I guess there's people out there thinking about these things. Unfortunately I don't currently have the time to do something similar ;_;
The thing that worries me is that I read a number of pools and exchanges who switched to XT got denial of service attacks so they had to turn it off. It's still a small enough market that it can be manipulated.
Did you read Mike Hearn's blog about how not increasing the blocksize would change the fee market? It was interesting watching a programmer starting to grapple with economics. It got dumped on by a lot of people but economically what he was saying made sense.

The connection between value and security (as I understand it): Every block a miner gets some coins for confirming the transactions. The more hashpower they point at the network the better the chance of getting those coins but also the more it costs to run their setup. So they will run a number of machines according to how much money they can expect to get from those blocks.

Yes but they also turn people off from the currency. I just lost $20 and I'm probably not going to use the currency again unless it's someone I personally know.

I feel that this ignores the issue of safe keeping of savings. I could hold my savings under my mattress, but I might get burglarized. Likewise, I could hold my bitcoin on my own computer but I might get a virus that steals my coins.
Bitcoin is nice because governments (theoretically) can't manipulate its value but there's still the challenge of keeping them safe.
@_date: 2015-11-23 14:47:16
I'm pumped that musicians are looking at Bitcoin and blockchain technology but this is the part that worries me. Culture starts getting fenced in behind a cryptographic gate and it reverses the gains that have been made so far. I guess people would just capture the sounds and put them up for other folks to download but then we're back to square one with artists not getting paid. Maybe this could be used to make it easier to pay artists but not necessarily mandatory? It's a tough problem to solve.
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:09:34
So it's some sort of protocol for trusted parties to exchange Bitcoin without having to use the blockchain?

True. I guess in my mind if we were going to assume the "ubiquitous mobile-money network" we'd assume internet access. I don't think internet access is there yet but with the improvements that are happening might allow for the leapfrogging of current infrastructure.

Or... y'know, individuals sending Bitcoin to each other without a brick-and-mortar middle-man. Remittance companies are an intermediate step, not the end goal. Ideally the receiving folks would be able to pay their utilities (and other services) in Bitcoin so they wouldn't have to convert stuff back. That will require a country with high inflation and high remittance inflows. I'm not sure what country fits that description though.

Thanks! This is exactly what I was looking for.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:12:38
I don't know if this will even get looked at but I figure I might as well try.
There's a big tension within Bitcoin right now. It is meant to act as a currency and it is a fantastic currency in theory. Because it's great in theory, a lot of people are "investing" in it to reap the future rewards of its use as a currency. So some people have started seeing it as a commodity instead of a currency because most of what they see is this "investing" thing and not its use as a medium of exchange. 
So if I have one thing to ask you is to consider it a currency, not a commodity. Regulatory agencies should not need any new powers to treat with the downsides of a new currency. Banks don't need new regulations to exchange a new currency. All the laws are already in place, we just need congress or a judge to clarify that Bitcoin is indeed a currency and can be treated just like any other currency. The fact that people "invest" in it is no different from people "investing" in Yen, Euros, Pesos, etc. Thanks for stopping by!

Thanks! I hadn't heard about Freicoin before. I'll have to give it a look.
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:51:57
Not necessarily. I travel between Colombia and the US a lot so I often have to exchange dollars to pesos. I could go to an official exchange and do this but I'd lose a good chunk of change to fees and the "sell rate" vs "buy rate." So I often find a friend or family member who needs the other currency and we exchange at a price similar to the "official" exchange rate. They save on fees, I save on fees, everybody wins. Person to person exchanges of bitcoin to dollars (or any other currency) will just shadow the "exchange" price. Of course there's limiting factors of how much they want to sell vs how much I want to buy, etc, and that's why some people (companies specifically) find it more convenient to use exchanges.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:30:18
:( if only I knew enough about programming and crypto-currencies to make it happen. The problems won't manifest themselves for a while so by then there'll probably be a currency that doesn't have them. When it comes along I'll be first in line to start mining :P

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! Although we're starting very focused on our local scene we hope using Bitcoin will also allow us to expand internationally quickly and easily.
Are there any features you'd like to see? Do you have any extra questions about the concept?
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:38:33
It does worry me that they say "0%" instead of just 0 BTC. You'd think they would go the Dwolla route of a set (very low) fee. Larger transactions don't inherently require any more resources to process so there's no reason they should cost more.
Edit: Still super excited about someone taking bitcoin to latin america though!

To the other economists in this thread, is anyone else waiting for a currency that is set to grow at a specific percentage (I'm thinking 2%) per year? It seems like that kind of currency would still avoid the problem of currency manipulation while avoiding the problem of deflation.
@_date: 2013-11-01 14:24:31
This expresses exactly how I feel. It's impossible for the government to prevent you from using cash to pay for things they don't want you paying for. Banks, on the other hand, can be used to keep you from paying for certain things. If the government tries to regulate anything about bitcoin it'll be the bitcoin banks, the currency itself will continue to be impossible to regulate much like cash.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:19:35
A form of Bitcoin that grows at 2% a year would be the one. It would have to wait until the bitcoin infrastructure is large enough that early adopters could be different from bitcoin early adopters :/.

You can buy a house with cash, you can go shopping at walmart with cash, you can shop at the mom and pop store with cash. They'll declare that cash as revenue, put it in their bank account, and it will re-enter the regulated economy. While it is cash though, it is impossible for the government to preempt a transaction. Same thing with bitcoin. 
While your bitcoins are in the exchanges it'll be possible for the government to preempt their use in certain transactions. However, once they're in your wallet there's no stopping the transactions. That's what the article is trying to get at. The USG looking at bitcoins just means there'll be a larger network of users but the current features of direct exchange will still be there. There's no way for them to "ban" direct exchange of bitcoin.
