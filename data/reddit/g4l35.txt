I can definitely see that.  Conservatives don't compromise, listen, or care.  Flaherty spoke, they will listen.  Just like when the banks were charging too little interest on mortgages - the deals were just too good.

As a friend of a friend of a minister I have come to see that nothing will change their mind.  Word has came down from above, the decisions are made, it is set in stone.  They don't compromise, they don't listen, and they sure as hell don't give a damn about you or me.

Orders from tigerdirect.ca are shipped from canada or from the us duty free, but they don't take bitcoins.

I am pretty sure that if you don't agree with the government of Canada, then you are a child pornographer.

You know what really grinds my gears on this topic?
It is that professor bitcorn is going to use this as proof that he was completely right.  He is going to be incredibly smug and pretend mtgox is the only exchange.
