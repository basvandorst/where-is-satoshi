Sounds like I don't have much to lose. :) I'll aim for $300 total income in a year's time as a goal. Sounds like a fun journey!

Excellent reply, and thanks for the details. I was leaving for a 10 week trip around the world with my wife when I got into BitCoins. At around $125/BTC, our $10K would be worth $61,800 today. Hindsight is 20/20, no? But let's not fool ourselves - it could just have easily went the other way. At the end of the day, I would not have passed on the trip I took with my wife. Best thing I could have done with $10K and I'd do it again tomorrow. Now that I am back to the grind, I have my little 5GH/s machine coming soon and I'll set it up at work in a pool and let it hash away. If I make ~0.12 BTC a month, that's pretty awesome to me.

As mentioned, I don't have to pay the electricity. Taking that into account, can I assume that I'll be able to make 0.123 BTC per month?

Wow there is a lot of hate in this thread. Question for OP: If you have two of the same miners, why not just switch the power supplies to verify that one is in fact dead? Also, the Jalapeno runs off of 13V @ 6A. Google is your friend: buy a new power supply.
Also to echo what [this guy] ( said: try mining something other than Bitcoin. You are one of quite literally millions of people interested in getting rich overnight with Bitcoin which of course means that it won't happen. Do your research and find a more profitable altcurrency or join an automatic pool (like Multipool) and mine away.
Finally, if you mined 0.043 in just 4 days, that's about $7 a day - which is WAY more money than you spent on electricity. No matter how you do your math, you are making a nice profit. That puts you well, well ahead of about 90% of the people reading this thread.
So freaking chill out.
