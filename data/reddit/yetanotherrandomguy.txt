I'd argue that for the first half of the country's life this was true.  I see the major turning point being after the Spanish American War when the military was centralized.  Previously, national defense was in the hands of militias, putting the power in the hands of the individuals.  However, by centralizing that power, they coerced the authority to have secrets (something not otherwise possible without force).

Most true statement ever.
@_date: 2012-07-14 00:17:01
Great news!
Buuut...where's the link?
@_date: 2012-08-21 13:56:38
It was in the article.
@_date: 2012-08-21 16:40:40
Actually, I need to brush up on that a bit.  The only thing I remember is that it was something related to Hamilton.  But he was a bit of an asshole, being the anti-Jefferson.
I'll be looking up the wikipedia article today after work.  Thanks for the history-reading prompt.

Is there an alternative that's as convenient?  I'm trying to buy some right now, and coinbase is out.  I won't have time to run down to do a physical cash purchase until tomorrow or the next day.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:26:03
It's not very likely.  My computer is a laptop that is with me at all times and I'm pretty sure there's no malware around.

These are also the same people who hire "senior" IT guys that chained their organizations to IE6 because it was "enterprise and secure".
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:48:36
This is very true.  Though, my password is a pretty decent one.  I suppose it's *possible* it was brute-forced, but not likely.
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:07:31
Unfortunately, I did not.  I'll know to do that next time.  That would have certainly saved me.
But that aside, I know that blockchain has to have been compromised in some way due to the number of people saying the same thing.  I doubt they all had key loggers or their passwords brute-forced.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:44:13
Give it a few years, and that same amount will buy nothing more than the bun.  It's stealth theft.  I prefer the theft I can see from hackers and guys in ski masks rather than the theft by guys in fancy suits.

My favorite slide is the one that says:


Everyone fawning over the FinCEN "official recognition" should keep this in mind.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:13:14
I'm thinking that OP meant something more along the lines of cryptocurrencies in general taking over the world or crashing and burning.  I don't think there is room for both government funny money and open currencies.
Basically, open currencies are a threat to the current concentrations of power.  If bitcoin has a chance to catch on globally with real staying power, then they will fight it to the death.  And, as dramatic as it sounds, there can be only one: government manipulated currencies or open, non-manipulated ones.

That is true.  Sales done in fiat could also still be taxed.  However applying a fee to fiat money conversion would do nothing but apply pressure to keep your money in bitcoins and deal in those directly.  But that's assuming that there would be an enforceable way of implementing this.  If I've got a $10 bill in my pocket and I hand it to you for bitcoin, it's not really possible for them to tax that transaction.

what's yubikey?
@_date: 2013-03-19 18:02:14
Yeah, I changed it when I added it to my user .functions file.  But I wanted to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding something about BC.
Thanks for the hookup!

Question on this:  Wouldn't the average price be more accurate rather than the last?
@_date: 2013-04-30 03:47:07
Yawn and continue using bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-02-15 19:41:55
Ah.  That's right. I guess I never thought about it.  I just figured they came from the magical bitcoin fairy.  Ya know...kinda like dollars and banks.
@_date: 2013-03-19 18:20:40
I couldn't up-vote your sentiment more.
No...really...I can't because I can only vote once.  *But*, I fully agree with this.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:09:32
Earlier today, I submitted a ticket to them just to give them the info I had and maybe help them find the source of the hack.
With that in mind, I would try to keep an open mind on bitcoin.  Really, I should have been using the extra email and/or cell phone confirmations if I wasn't using an offline wallet.  They had that level of security available.  You can be assured I'm using them for my other accounts now (thankfully I had my coins split up).
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:49:06
Very similar to what happened to me:

The media and school indoctrination freely provides this service.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:24:55
I'm not sure how I could be fishing for tips considering I don't have any tip thing set up here.
Basically, this is a story of "with great power...".
Bitcoin comes with a lot of potential in changing the world of money.  However, the price of freedom is more personal responsibility.  It is entirely MY fault for not securing them sooner.
But...that doesn't mean I can't want to bash this fucker's skull in. =)

I'm glad to hear someone else was smarter and safer than I was.

What...kbinferno said
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:41:39
Its possible.  But I'm doubtful of that.  My password is a pretty decent one.
I'm not a big security expert, but perhaps there was something that was able to grab my session or something, I dunno.  I was one big block of addresses that the guy pulled from in one sweep of which mine was one.  So he had *some* system in place.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:05:59


I entirely agree.  There *is* room for both.  However, my doubt about the possibility of both coexisting is not based on space, but rather the greed of those who currently occupy that space.


This is very true.  But, what about the scenario where enough merchants accept it that it's viable to be paid entirely in bitcoin?  It's hard to be taxed on income that has no paper trail.
@_date: 2013-03-21 21:23:10
If that's the case, then how would they be able to pay to one of those other ones if they were out?  Maybe that's a noob question too.  I might be missing part of the picture.
@_date: 2013-03-05 16:48:12
I think for something as young and niche as this, volatility is to be expected.  I don't think anyone should expect stability to come until wider acceptance.
Personally, I'm expecting a drop to around 20-25 at *some* point (maybe not in 6 hours).  But that's just because this recent rise has been so steep.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:32:28
Sorry.  I'd rather deal with theft of this nature than the theft on a national scale that your fake dollar inflation causes.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:46:25
[See my post here](
Some scumbag stole my bitcoins.  How, I don't know.  But it sounds like the same thing happened to you
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:47:05
Or increased interest.  Many would consider these huge selling points.  Just look at the public opinion on "the War on Drugs" BS.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:25:56
You mean the one that they can change for every individual transaction if they wanted to?
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:51:18
Everyone should take note that it seems blockchain has been compromized.  This is the 4th thing I've seen ([including my own 4.5 btc]( in which some piece of shit has stolen money from people's acounts.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:05:45
Lol.  I think you're confusing "free market" with "corporatocracy".
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:39:30
Thanks.  I really believe in bitcoin and its potential.  But this is no sooner the currencies fault than if it were the Fed's fault if I had my wallet full of cash stolen from my car.
I just wish more people would stop trying to tell people to not use bitcoin because they are, for the first time, in a situation that the nanny state can't help them and they are responsible for themselves.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:58:58
That sucks.  Making an offline wallet was the first weekend todo item for me.
At least we can take solace in the fact that this dirt bag is the type of person who will end up getting shot.  Or better yet, get their face beaten into hamburger meat when they finally cross the wrong person.
Though, it's likely dirt *bags* since it seems like the batch that my coins were a part of was split among several accounts.
Good luck to you in securing your coins in the future.  You can be damn sure I won't make the same mistake twice.
@_date: 2013-02-16 01:47:15
Most definitely.  With the increased convenience of purchasing, it's easy to see why the market is growing.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:15:29
I think there is so many loopholes in an arbitrary prohibition of "using bitcoins" that it would not be possible to enforce.
One example would be using an intermediary.  If I as the merchant am not allowed to accept bitcoin but wanted to do business with someone who owns bitcoin, I could still do business with him if he converted his bitcoin to dollars then gave me those dollars.
If I'm not mistaken, there's already some service similar to this in that it allows merchants to accept bitcoins, but changes it directly to dollars for them.  This way, they can support bitcoin without tying their business to this new, unproven currency.
And this is just off the top of my head.  I'm sure there are even more inventive ways that circumvent the laws that effectively nullify any attempt at regulation.
@_date: 2013-03-24 15:22:32
No joke.  Those are two of the most counter-productive ways to perpetuate decentralization.
If you want real freedom, go open source.
@_date: 2013-03-21 21:23:45
Ah.  That would make sense.  I just hope that isn't the case though.
