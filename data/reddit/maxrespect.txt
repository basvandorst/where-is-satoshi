Do you believe in Bitcoin? Will you use Bitcoin? Do you believe others will use Bitcoin?
I do.

Yeah ok it's just so volatile at the moment you have to make sure to buy back instantly. I think this should be explained for new users like myself who might avoid spending because of price fluctuations.

I would drink the beer.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:53:40
Yeah of course. I'm just a bit confused about the effect of Bitcoin speculation/growth on fiat currency. Is it inflationary or is it the opposite?

It's a BitCoin prize I guess, not actual BitCoin transactions. Still find this interesting though.

Ok...I guess I was just thinking that if If I wanted to make billions of dollars disappear I would invent virtual money.

Having worked at The Royal Mint and knowing their past history of jumping on bandwagons they think will be profitable (Gold and silver bullion, Indian Sovereigns, London 2012) I would suggest this is the gravest indication yet that the Bitcoin bubble is about to burst!
It's funny to read this because I was the person who first made the management at The Royal Mint aware of Bitcoin at the tail end of 2011.

Because of the time it takes to add new funds to exchange accounts, instead of depositing more cash many people will sell what they are holding as the price begins to fall, with the hope of buying in at the bottom and increasing their stash of coins. I think this creates an artificial 'bottom' and increasing volatility.

I'm just looking at the chart and visualising a worst case scenario based on low levels of growth excluding the bubble activity.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:18:52
Yeah but the sellers are anonymous so it is possible that the government hold the majority of Bitcoin and could dump them at the top of the bubble.

Total bed wetter.

So we should expect it to bottom at $150 and return to around $250?
