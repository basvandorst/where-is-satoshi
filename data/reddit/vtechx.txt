Yeah, I'm sure they are having a grand old time right now...

Will BTC lent out in a margin position be treated as "Held Bitcoin" or will it be safe from any haircut? Legally, the margin funding trading provider through BTC should not be liable for any loss as the Bitcoin was not his at the time of the hack and he is still owed the BTC he gave to the counterparty to trade with. Unfortunately, it is the trader who is responsible for it. What are Bitfinex plans to deal with this?

Don't get Stamped or Kraked.

Many of us don't use reddit a lot until that is the only way of finding out what is going on with our savings. I thought the post had a good point.
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:08:50
This is not true. Read their announcement again.
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:07:50
So they can just say, ok, we're done here, you lost your $, bye. ORRRR... They could get back in business and try to make back as much as they can to pay back. Bankrupcy is horrible for all.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:11:29
This is exactly what I said as soon as they were hacked.
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:48:43
I doub they care about your passport when there is $100,000,000 worth of Bitcoin to steal right there...
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:15:36
Yeah, that doesn't work like that. Also, all positions are closed at 604.
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:46:27
Yes. All banks socialize losses. Think about it.
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:32:22
Except their boxes were more like bank accounts.
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:56:12
What's the difference?
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:13:37
To a fool, even wisdom sounds foolish.

A mother is necessary for invention.
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:44:37
Umm, no. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:12:52
Oh, blah. Chill out man, we're not "the rich". In all likelihood, it was your coins stolen, and they're doing their best to make it up to you. Let them sort this out, plenty of time for the anger phase later.
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:05:52
You can sue them and lose 150,000 or more. Trust me, BFX goes under and you will be 10 times more angry.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:37:43
WHICH WORKED!!!! ARGGHHH! Leave it to the CFTC to **** **** up good.

Point is that traders are a crucial part of any currency ecosystem. Look at low-volume fiat currencies - they are not convenient and their utility is low. There is a correlation between volume and stability.

If it does, they will buy it back on the cheap and then be able to repay the hold-outs fully, making this the most successful hack recovery ever.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:12:16
I like this idea as well.
@_date: 2014-10-20 04:10:07
Fake, that suit can't be worth more than .0000001 BTC, .185 BTC will be a fortune.

This is why I stopped mining at home.

This guy is a long-time troll. He is on a vendetta because he got blacklisted after he started posting people's personal information and harassing users. He was most likely trying to scam people out of a significant amount of money and is upset that his scheme has been foiled. Ignore him and move along, he's not worth your time.
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:16:12
Awesome! Best looking Bitcoin cold storage on the face of the planet, here I come!
@_date: 2014-05-02 01:15:35
This is pure nonsense. This guy is seriously unstable. He went on a spree posting my personal information in rating's comments section on the BTCjam website (he gave negative ratings to people who loaned him money before). At first he threatened to "visit" me at my home, and then threatened me with a defamation lawsuit - all for a comment that advised him to seek a smaller loan when he asked to go from .5 BTC to 10 BTC - it wasn't rude in any way whatsoever. He kept insisting even after everyone told him that it's ridiculous and all it would achieve is a SLAPP lawsuit. Not to mention Mr. Genius deleted his own posting, including the comment - thus destroying his "evidence".
BTCjam is a great site that keeps improving. The staff listens to the users and adds the features we request most. Sure, they are a small company so they may not respond instantly at all times, but they do respond and I've never had to wait longer than I'd expect at any other website.
They are DEFINITELY not a fraud. They are 100% legitimate and they provide a valuable service. This claim is the OP's insane tantrum. QQ, guy, and get on with your life.

BTC is deflationary, but nice try ;)
@_date: 2014-05-11 09:27:50
Again, look up Bitcoin Embassy.

Come ON! Where are the 300 movie themed artworks with Cryptonidas slaying the mighty BearWhale??!?! Guh! Someone make this, it HAS to be done, and I cannot give it the awesomeness it must have. This is BITCOIN!
@_date: 2014-10-09 00:46:59
Using numbers instead of letters will mean your wallet lasts about .1 second longer. Pointless, its already accounted for in the hashing algorithm.
@_date: 2014-05-11 09:25:48
Look up Bitcoin Embassy.
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:29:47
No worries, it's only about $500,000 - peanuts.
