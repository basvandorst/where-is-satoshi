The real question we should be asking is: do you think they'll be buying bitcoin with their big short payoffs?
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:50:54
Bitcoin will always increase over the long term. There will be no maximum price. It is possible for bitcoin to be worth several times more than the total value of fiat currency.

Common misunderstanding. You can buy, send, or receive bitcoin in fractional amounts down to the hundred millionths. That is one of the features that makes bitcoin useful, which justifies the value of Bitcoin.

You didn't account for market cap. You're not comparing correctly. The proper comparison is Bitcoin's market cap compared with the total number of dollars. Bitcoin's market cap is the price times the supply (16.8M Bitcoin). There is more value in dollars than in bitcoin.      
Also, I do think that Bitcoin's value (market cap) can surpass the value of the dollar (all dollars combined).    
In the future, make sure to doubt yourself just enough to check your work before making any big conclusions.

Everybody has to learn somehow.     
All money is finite. However there's two different kinds of currency: inflationary ones and deflationary ones. The dollar is inflationary because the government can create more.  Inflationary currency is worth less each year. Deflationary is the opposite. It becomes more valuable because there are fewer of them over time.     
This is just one reason why Bitcoin is unstoppable. It's baked in that it'll be worth more and more.

Good question. I think bitcoin will continue to dominate because it's far ahead as the most popular crypto right now, and because of Ai.    
Google's search AI tends to give people more ofwhat they're interested in. Bitcoin is generating a ton of interest, which in turn drives up the price, creating more interest. This creates a synergy that pushes the price higher and higher. It's good to HODL because the price is a balance between the number of people actually selling at that price, and the number of buyers. The price goes up if there is more willing buyers than sellers.    
In short, HODLing make the price go up, and that encourages others to do the same.

@_date: 2017-12-12 16:42:24
The future can be reasonably predicted if you identify the factors that affect it and you find the indicators. You then estimate your confidence and act accordingly. This is why you should HODL.    
We have a  bitcoin enthusiast community on Reddit of over a half million people. And it's growing by 1% a day. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:12:57
Don't. Seriously. The bitcoin community prefers educated bitcoiners. Teach them the long term value and they'll be motivated to learn the rest on their own. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:04:17
Key word: yet. Not reliable store of value YET, not easy to spend YET.

They gotta keep the price from rising too fast. Unfortunately, the entire world is in a race to buy as much bitcoin as they can. Most of the world is unaware of this. They'll catch on before too long. The sooner you buy the better it will be for you.

I think it might be a little more complex than that. Math and stuff. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:14:58
Those are good examples of the generalization of a concept. Bitcoin is different than the other cryptos because the critical mass has overcome that general principle. Besides, general principles have too many exceptions to be relied on as an immutable law like gravity. Bitcoin is one of those exceptions. It's price will go up along with its popularity.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:33:42
Long term, the price will always continue to rise. It will reward choosing to adopt bitcoin sooner than later.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:18:35
Let me rephrase the question then. Is there any reason to think there will ever be a price ceiling? How would that mechanism work?

The price curve indicates that Bitcoin has captured people's attention, and dollars, to the point that legit bankers and investment professionals who manage a great deal of wealth are going to start buying them. Bitcoin is catching on like a viral video. Once it draws enough views, the high number of views draws more in, raising the view count and strengthening this mechanism.. The same thing is happening with Bitcoin and its price. Price goes up, draws attention, gets investors, raises price, repeat. Some of those people will cash out early and slow the price growth. Some of them will read more and more and more about bitcoin. Those are the HODLers.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:18:52

That's kinda nebulous to call something bad. Be more specific. Right now it's not easy to spend because of high fees. The high fees are because Bitcoin is only capable of 4 transactions per second. Soon, the lightning network will be implemented. That will allow thousands of more transactions per second. The incentive is to buy bitcoin now because the price will really skyrocket once the lightning network goes live. There is no price ceiling for Bitcoin.

Good question. A typical person controls their actions and has some influence on their tight circle of contacts. By starting this info campaign, a certain number of people will be influenced, which will lead to a positive result on bitcoin's price. We all benefit. 
I've noticed how price walls build up over time. It's just people picking round numbers for no good reason. We should squash this trend. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:24:42
We'll have to see. But since bitcoin is already at such a commanding lead, it will be hard for another to overtake it. There's only so much programming talent out there. This is likely to be an exception to the general principle that the first competitor loses out to the innovator.

You have it inverted. Perhaps you haven't considered the scarcity of Bitcoin. The more people who own Bitcoin, the higher the price will go. This is because there is a set number of bitcoins to ever be produced. (21,000,000). There's 16.7 million right now. The last Bitcoin will be mined in 2140.

There is a trend where the innovating company is bested by the improving company. Best example is Myspace and Facebook.   
Bitcoin is different.  It is the exception to this trend. Bitcoin has hit a critical mass of adoption. It will continue to outpace the others. Maybe there will be another contender for the king spot. But bitcoin will likely dominate market share on google sized proportions.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:55:22
HODL! Bitcoin is growing faster than your loan interest building up. Bitcoin is going to eventually go over $1M when the banks start wanting them. And that'll be soon.     
Also Bitcoin is a new tech. The price goes up the more people adopt the tech, which is just about to come out of it's infancy.

Bad advice. We've gotten to the point where you can buy $1000 of bitcoin per month and never get to a whole bitcoin. The price is rising too fast, and nothing seems to be able to slow it. AND this is just the beginning. How much do you think bitcoin will be worth when a billion people use it? That's still only a small percentage of the whole world.    
Think about the price in 50 years.
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:49:12
The unification is here
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:49:08
The proper way to evaluate the decision is to do a cost benefit analysis. I did one earlier. Selling btc now is the absolute worst decision you could possibly make. I'm literally starving myself to keep from selling. Wait until the point where bitcoin will increase so much in value that paying off your loans would only take 20% of your total bitcoin.    
Never sell all of your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:43:40
Could you imagine if everyone did that?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:35:13

@_date: 2017-12-07 23:17:25
Forget about $20k. Just tell the people you care about to get in now. The price now is just pennies compared to what's coming. Every month people will say how much they regret not buying Bitcoin last month. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:54:09
Yes and no. It's essentially like how a government works. The top 1% control policy, but the majority of people also wield a good degree of power. 
By coordinating the masses of people with only fractional Bitcoin, we empower each other to become even stronger. Together we are strong.

@_date: 2017-12-13 05:47:20
You do better to wait. Bitcoin is just beginning to take off. There is no bubble. The price is following the tech S curve. There's plenty more room to grow. (That's nerd for HODL).
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:07:22
Now we just need an ad hoc internet so that Bitcoin could survive even if someone attempted to block internet access.

Someone should counter wager him. If bitcoin hits $1M by 2020 they'll eat John's dick. And by that time early bitcoin investors would easily have enough money to make that happen.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:26:37
Do I need to be more specific when I speak in aphorisms? If you don't think an effort will work, how motivated are you going to be to go after it? What if that extra bit of motivation is what pushes you past the threshold into success?

That certainly is a spectacle.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:52:46
Nope. The most secure way is to memorize your master seed pass phrase. That's a list of 12, 18, or 24 words that is your access to your bitcoin wallet where everything is stored. Trust nobody. Repeat your pass phrase over and over in your head like a prayer. It needs to be automatic. Make a mnemonic device. When you get out of jail you'll be a millionaire easy.

Yeah impossible. Ever watch family feud?
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:58:59
Well, there are 542k in our community. Besides, higher fees are good for keeping bitcoin price high. Higher fees discourage speculation and encourage HODLing.

As long as people aren't distracted by shitcoins, it shouldn't lose momentum. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:48:05
No. There is no end game. It is probable that there is no price ceiling. Scarce supply combined with a certain amount of btc becoming lost forever one way or another will push the price higher and higher. Bitcoin may one day be more valuable that total fiat currency. Bitcoin represents a percentage ownership in mankind's future wealth. It will always appreciate over the medium term.    
We're at the point where you can buy $1000 bitcoin a month and never own a whole bitcoin. It's still the best investment strategy to HODL, buy the dip, teach your loved ones.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:12:32
Sorry for not being specific enough. A tax attorney, a CPA, or equivalent.

It's a good rule to never cash out completely because this contributes somewhat to panics. It's best for the community to just hold because this reduces the supply for sale thus pressuring the price to go higher.

Rules applied to one situation can change upon significant change. There's enough different about these two things to make comparison foolish. Is bitcoin a company? No. That's enough right there. Is bitcoin run by criminals? No. Is Bitcoin using creative accounting where the profit it books (huh?) is protected for ten years ahead instead of using actual figures? No. 
Why is it so hard for you to see past your previous conclusions? Right. Admitting you're wrong and ready to learn is hard for some people. Practice makes perfect.

That conversion is called a realization event. If you think you're smarter than the IRS you are definitely wrong. You need to pay the taxes. Now if you're smart, you'll wait until after you've held it over a year. That way you pay capital gains tax at 15% instead of paying ordinary income tax, which is a good bit higher.

Bitcoin is the iPhone. Everything else is windows phone in a land where android was never invented. You've managed to misunderstand your way out of the absolute best argument for HODLing bitcoin. The tech adoption curve will push bitcoin over $1M. HODL

That's not inflation. Inflation is when there's more money issued. You've confused inflation with bitcoin's price going up. Bitcoin is inflating by 12.5 bitcoins every ten minutes. In May 2020 that will drop in half. And again 4 years later.

It's a blend of both speculators and bitcoin enthusiasts. There is a high conversion rate from speculator to enthusiast. The enthusiasts know to HODL.     
Bitcoin is a new tech, and it's about to really take off in value.    
This is because bitcoin's price goes up along with it's popularity.
@_date: 2018-10-17 17:50:18
Maybe, but when inflation of Bitcoin drops below the dollar's inflation, it will spur adoption, which increases the price. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:46:52
That doesn't change the rules.

@_date: 2018-10-17 23:11:58
So, that's not correct. It is inflating by 12.5 bitcoins every ten minutes or so (each block reward). After the Halvening, it'll be 6.25 bitcoins per block. The total capacity is 21,000,000 Bitcoin. The current total is just over 17,000,000. Yes it's inflating even though the total supply is capped.

10 reasons why you shouldn't name your penis "Dragon"
1. Creates unrealistic expectations that, 
2. You cannot possibly meet. 
3. Might accidentally attract real dragon. 
4. Requires gold donations in the form of 24k chains. 
5. Hobbits can outsmart it. 
6. Harry Potter might stab it. 
7. It's intimidating to those it hunts. 
8. Dragons can be small.
9. You miss the opportunity to call it, Mjolnir.

@_date: 2019-02-05 08:34:45
When then, does one do that?
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:01:16
I'm talking about the underlying issue. The question, "can people emotionally grasp the concept of a high price for Bitcoin" is asking a price question as an assumption. That question is asking how high can the price go given that people are impressed by Bitcoin's past performance.  Maybe I should've been more clear in stating that the question (as asked) is irrelevant. The price will continue to act as it has under the forces that have only gained momentum. Hash rate is up. Bitcoin core continues to be incrementally improved via a dedicated development team of people who literally love Bitcoin and would do anything to see it succeed as the global reserve currency due to Bitcoin's hard supply cap and security.
There is a dedicated following of Bitcoin maximalists who will succeed no matter what. So it doesn't matter about grasping a high price for Bitcoin. You can buy miniscule amounts of Bitcoins. It's not like you have to buy a whole Bitcoin. Try buying $800 of Google stock or Amazon stock. Bitcoin will always grow in users, holders, hash rate, and notoriety. It will always recover from a bear market. And because of how devalued inflationary fiat money (see: dollars) becomes over time and compare that with Bitcoin's hard cap. It's no wonder the price has performed as it has. It's subject to market cycles like all marketable things. But it always recovers. 
The next bull run in coming. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 16:45:21
Not your keys not your bitcoin. Why do people buy gold again? Also, that "lost my keys" scenario is likely to be compensated for after the quadra scandal. I mean that this makes Bitcoin stronger because of how the community reacts.

Well in the first ten years the price has gone from $0.003 per Bitcoin to nearly $20,000. If some country was ten years old and it's currency performed this well against EVERY OTHER CURRENCY IN THE WORLD, wouldn't it draw some attention? 
What created this phenomenon? It's because bitcoin is better money than fiat money that governments print. 
In 20 to 30 years, bitcoin will be the world reserve currency and serve as a secure digital store of mankind's wealth. Bitcoin is growing, developing, and catching on globally. 
Look at the 7,000,000,000 of us and project this out. It's pretty easy to see where it's going. 
The rapid pace of adoption is unstoppable. It's just a matter of time. Technological S curve, baby. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 04:16:10
Mostly correct. However Bitcoin is not a company, so be careful when applying loosely fitting metaphors. Bitcoin is the digital store of wealth for planet Earth. It is the best money, and as such, it will prevail. As it becomes more and more popular and people begin to rely more and more on it the value will surpass all expectation.

The conditions of growth still exist unchanged. Bitcoin's value grows in waves. The more people who demand bitcoin the more the price appreciates. There is still a very tiny fraction of people who even have a sufficient understanding to realize it's true potential. That means there's tons of room for growth. Very few people currently own Bitcoin. Even if you think it will never have another bull run, there is so much potential that the cost benefit benefit analysis shows you should still invest just a little just in case. There's 7,000,000,000 people in the world. 
The law of large numbers applies. So, when you have a significant population of humans, behavior patterns emerge. These patterns will continue with some regularity. Next bull run is going to be spectacular.

My bad. Baked into the rules of Bitcoin is a strict limit on the creation of new bitcoins. Bitcoin is rewarded to the miners at a rate that is cut in half ever four years until 2140, when the 21,000,000th bitcoin is issued to the last miner. From that point, the bitcoin network will have transitioned to a fee system to justify costs and profit for miners. 
When Bitcoin first was started by Satoshi Nakamoto ten years ago the miner reward was 50 bitcoins per block, with a block every 10 minutes. Every four years is a blessed event called the halvening. That's when the reward gets cut in half. There's been two halvenings so far, and the current reward is 12.5 bitcoin. Next halvening is May 2020. There is an anticipated bull run expected before. 
This is BECAUSE bitcoin is solid money versus regular government money that's based on inflation. Bitcoin is digital gold.

It's not a problem to Bitcoin users. That's a problem for the inner workings of the miners. It doesn't affect the security of addresses and balances. I'm sure the open source nature of Bitcoin will sort that issue out eventually.

By "no inflation" you must mean there won't be inflation after 2140. 
1800 bitcoins are mined per day currently. This inflates the supply of Bitcoin by .01% per day or &lt;4% annually. However this rate will decrease by half every four year until reaching zero in 2140. The next halvening is in May 2020.
This will eventually make bitcoin less inflationary than all other currencies.

@_date: 2019-01-10 13:25:26
Yeah. That's going to run you 0.2BTC
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:27:51
Yes. And because of that you'll lose the most.       
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:39:02
Sometimes people read fake news and they panic sell. Bitcoin is perfectly fine. Don't panic sell. You can't predict the short term market swings. This happens to Bitcoin all of the time. But it keeps recovering more than each dip.

@_date: 2018-03-21 18:48:35
You're a special kind of stupid. The kind of stupid that STAYS stupid. Look for the weak link in the chain. Your system can fail in many ways. Having any confidence in your plan means you're stupid. You've allowed yourself to be blinded by bias to think your plan won't fail. You congratulate yourself on the complexity of your plan. But it is precisely the complexity that makes it unsecure. The fact that many others have told you this should key you in to the fact that you're stupid. Admit it and you can free yourself from it.

Those damn gays and their hurricane (not caused by fictional global warming) bringing legally acceptable ways. Why, back in my day we had a word for people like that. We called them [Every single racial slur deleted. Pages and pages and pages. So many it's like there was one slur for each possible description of a person, but if delivered with the right tone, the deliverer could make the receiver feel bad. This works BTW.

You're a scam.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:15:12
That's nothing. Be patient. Bitcoin's price volatility is offset by the rapid adoption that's taking place. Basically it goes up more than down. Nobody really knows why. We just know that it does.

Make sure to realize your losses by selling low instead of waiting a few years. Lock in this fear, uncertainty, and doubt for good. Don't worry about the regret you'll have for changing your mind knowing all well the long term value of bitcoin and the fact that we're still in the early adopter phase. If you want stability, why don't you wait till half the world already owns bitcoin? Sure, you'll never have a whole bitcoin, but who would want to own a million dollar decentralized digital currency after the stock market corrects? Not me. That's why I panic sold for a loss.

Yeah, but you'd have to calculate the sustainability of that solution. The alliance should be careful in setting up its targets. It will grow organically with bitcoin.

Everyone has a limit. That's why the ALTS wull slowly grind down further and further. It doesn't matter how long you want to hold a downward trending death spiral. The only choice is what you value more: the chance, or the cash value. At a certain point, each person evaluates whether they sell or not. I recommend selling for max value now that the trend is becoming clearer. If you trust the tech, buy back in at a lower price later. It'll be on sale. Meanwhile, you park 100% of your crypto $ in BTC while it's trending up.

You must understand the halvening. The mining reward is cut in half every four years. This explodes the price because the miners aren't selling as much Bitcoin as their rewards are smaller in Bitcoin but higher in value because of the price increases.

It's a public worldwide blockchain. Everybody can "oversee" it. 
They won't have any power to change it in any way. But they can look just like anyone else.

You miss the point. The idea is that you never sell your Bitcoin. When it's appreciated enough, just spend it directly. That's the beauty. That's why cryptocurrency builds value so fast. At some point in time, your Bitcoin could easily be the most valuable thing you own. Just make sure you control your own private keys and never tell anyone and never write it down on a computer, phone, tablet, etc.
