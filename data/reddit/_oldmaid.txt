Locking someones account that shows they are as skilled as you should be seen as a compliment. And although you are completely right you saved them a lot of money with this, that doesn't mean they have a contract to pay you. That's how most companies operate, if they don't have to pay they don't. It's not the way things should be maybe, but it is the way things are. Move on, i'm sure many companies out there WILL value your skill, if not US then Chinese for sure.

Well he's looking for a simple phrase to describe it. Bitcoin solves the problem of a global currency. Gold is a global currency but it's not modern enough for most people to use. So in short: Bitcoin solves the problem of a modern global currency.

I remember when I first started with Litecoin 5 years ago you could just send coins without a fee and it was fine. But then later if you did that it got stuck forever. Things are always changing in this field and old apps sometimes can't keep up. You said you had some old BTC sitting around, I would guess that old app you used might have caused you some trouble.

I wouldn't want to donate coins. But I would be willing to mine.

I wouldn't say absolutely mining is preferable. Any website can still have donation addresses for people that want to. But this just gives other people the ability to maybe use their old mining equipment for good. I think the main benefit here would be the confidence factor. If a website like wikileaks had a massive mining pool behind them it would be a great show of confidence. If people saw a huge number of others willing to "burn money" as some people say because mining is unprofitable, what does that tell you about how much they believe? It would be kinda like a visible vote of support. That anyone can see.

correct this isn't about how good bitcoin is at sending money or not. It's just about the fact that it can always be used as an alternative where others can't or don't' want to go.

This would even out the income stream though so it was more like ad revenue then donations. I look at the cost of mining as the cost of doing that. For example, you could buy all your food in bulk if you wanted to and save 5% but you pay the store for the convenience of spreading out the cost over time. Also with that mining over time you get the ability to focus on individual things. For example people could point their miners at individual stores or sections and power those sections to work harder. There's a lot more that could be done with this then just donations. But donations can still happen anyone that wanted to just donate could same as before. I'm just suggesting that they open a mining pool account and allow people to mine if they want.
