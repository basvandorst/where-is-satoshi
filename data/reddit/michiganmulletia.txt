Only for everyday payments. You still get decentralized storage on the original blockchain. At least that’s my understanding. And who’s to say there won’t be more advancements to this in the future!?

For now. Until merchants want lower fees and faster transactions :)
I’m not saying it’s better yet, but it will be.

Cool, dude. Cool.

Yeah I’m speaking only of the cycle between bitcoin and alts. Historically bitcoin runs first and then the alts catch up. Bitcoin is leading the way for another alt run currently. 
Which ones? I don’t know. The good ones, the ones with marketing, the stand outs. Pick a handful that you like. Or don’t. Bitcoin is number 1 for sure. But there will be another surge in alts before this bull run ends.

Also no, I don’t remember mark from Michigan lol. Sounds like a cool dude though.

Alts will have their run again. It’s foolish to think otherwise. 
Is Bitcoin the king? Absolutely. 
Both can be true.
@_date: 2019-08-01 08:45:43
Just to be clear I’m not saying all alt coins will rise. 
But I am sure that bitcoin dominance will significantly decrease as the alts have another run at some point.

I’d say xrp (funny that it autocorrected to crap when I first typed it) certainly has the potential to grow. I do not believe in it or endorse it at all, but absolutely it can come back to it’s all-time highs again. 
2017 wasn’t the only time the alts made a run against bitcoin either. It was just the most significant.

If you want to know my top alt choices they are:
NXS- Nexus
LTC- Litecoin
ETH- Ethereum
NANO- Nano
ONT- Ontology
MIOTA- Iota
But I think a lot of alts will run, and some won’t. Overall the market share of alts vs. bitcoin will increase at some point during this bull run and there will be btc that can be made from it.
@_date: 2019-08-01 16:02:40
Right. But it’s not going to rise forever, there is a cycle with alts just as there is a cycle with bitcoin price/dominance. The higher the dominance gets, the more likely it is to fall/correct. 
Not permanently or anything.

Fuck my ass.

Alright, you convinced me... time to sell!
@_date: 2019-04-14 15:01:35
$192k Tether would sure be weird.
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:02:54
Yeah no chance it’s going up to $50,000 today. Absolutely zero. Everyone agrees.

Thank you! I use cold storage on a Ledger Nano S. Not because I understand why, but because it’s what I was told was the safest way to store my crypto. I’m assuming running a node is a good way to make sure your transactions are going through when you want to move them? And also to confirm that the crypto you have in cold storage is actually there? 
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:57:14
Also don’t feel like you need to answer every question. I’ll be doing a lot of research on my own as well. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 20:58:41
Yeah I started small last December but there were so many dips to buy that now all I have is innernet money. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:30:20
Would you be kind enough to help me understand why you should run your own node, or what a node is? Any links/reading material would be appreciated. I’d love to understand more.
