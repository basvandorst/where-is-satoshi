I disagree, bitcoin with trusted third parties would still be based on sound money which is one of the most important aspects of bitcoin.
Luckily we don't need to worry about that because lightning makes it trustless.  I think we'll always have some trusted third parties though.

If they implemented batching alone they would use/need only 10% of available blockspace and with segwit it would be another 40% improvement on top of that.

Your numbers are way off, 64mb would only allow roughly 20 million people to do 1 tx per day.
Bitcoin can process roughly 300,000 tx/day with 1mb blocks.  So for 7 billion people to do 1 bitcoin tx/day you'd need 23gb blocks.

Supersammy is most likely correct here. This doesn't appear to be spam to me.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:18:13
If bitcoin goes down right now, the rest of crypto is likely to follow.  Investors understand that bitcoin has scaling issues because it has scale.  Investors also understand the value in a decentralized currency that has been tested and attacked repeatedly and came out more anti-fragile every single time.  Development on the bitcoin protocol and for 2nd layer tech is way ahead on bitcoin than any other coin.
This advantage wont last forever but it will last long enough.  Other coins might have high prices but they don't have a whole lot of users or unique use cases. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:55:42
It is unreasonable if your looking to scale globally, if the ecosystem isn't forced to use blockspace more efficiently now it's going to be exceedingly difficult to grow to global scale later.
No reason to kick the can down the road with a blocksize increase, doing so would only make it more difficult for the network to adapt once it's larger.  Intentionally restricting blockspace now is the way to go, it incentivizes companies, developers, and individuals to come up with actual scaling solutions and to use blockspace more efficiently. It sucks because tx fees are high, but it's necessary.

I give a some benefit of the doubt to coinbase, this could have been lost in the chaos of scaling to several millions of users in a year.  They've also been recruiting devs frantically in the last month or two. 
Absent that , I suspect ulterior motives.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:41:38
This is mostly because coinbase and gemini haven't implemented segwit and don't batch transactions.  
Coinbase alone represents over 50% of all bitcoin blockspace due to their incompetence. Gemini likely represents another significant percentage..
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:47:58
Tell that to the average cash supporter.  I'm going to love pointing out the obvious inconsistencies. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:35:04
I give Erik a lot of credit for that, he's still only 3% of txs by his own admission.
Coinbase likely uses the largest amount of blockspace because they are the largest exchange and one of the only ones to not introduce transaction batching.  Every exchange that has implemented implemented segwithas also implemented transaction batching so their total blockspace footprint is very small.  Likely just a single largish tx per block.  
Coinbase does every tx individually and charges their customers accordingly likely using up a very large percentage of available blockspace.
Blockchain.info is likely the other big offender.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:21:50


Not really a threat.


Not everyone browses the sub daily


Yep, this all takes time and segwit adoption is key to using lightning so it should be encouraged.


Personally, I have no idea what the blocksize should be. That said, my node is doing just fine.
Edit: I'm curious, do you think batching is something that should be adopted?
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:35:40
Once the attackers have spent all their resources things would go back to normal.  Attacking bitcoin is expensive.  Also, there are ways of making attacks useless by changing proof of work if it becomes a problem.

~3.3gb blocks needed for 1 tx/week for 7 billion people
~750mb blocks needed for 1 tx/month for 7 billion people
Still very large.  A blocksize increase now is not a real solution, it just further encourages people and companies to use blockspace inefficiently making the problem more painful later to deal with.  Better to bite the bullet now.  Once we integrate all possible solutions (schnorr, mast, transaction batching, lightning, etc.) then we can think about increasing the blocksize.

I don't know...LN has been vilified by bcash supporters to the point where almost none of them understand it and constantly spread FUD about it.

@_date: 2018-01-21 06:32:53
Technically you are correct.  If coinbase and gemini implemented batching without segwit we would have empty blocks right now. 
So should we stop pressuring them to implement this and hope it works out?

People are aren't necessarily upset with them for being incompetent, it's more because of numerous comments from the Brian and also actions Coinbase has taken in the last couple months that have people pissed at them.

@_date: 2018-01-12 16:20:50
Closer to 58% of all network traffic actually.
If they implemented batching they'd use 80% less blockspace and with segwit they'd optimize an additional 40% on top of that.
This would save them and their users millions in transaction fees.  There is no reason for this level of incompetence.

Maybe, I doubt it though.  Bitcoin has proven itself as a store of value after being attacked from pretty much all conceivable angles for years.  No other altcoin has done this or even been attacked in the first place.  They all ride along comfortably in the path bitcoin has forged.


Many would say this would be the best case scenario to give time for development to catch up with demand.  I have a hard time disagreeing.

There is a use case for bitcoin banks, there are vast swaths of people/businesses who are not comfortable being there own bank. They will gladly offload that responsibility for a fee or some other tradeoff.  Third parties can offer value to customers even with bitcoin.  
That said it is very likely that banks will compete along side decentralized options and idividuals.  One may completely eclipse the other or they may end up competing against each other or maybe carve out their own niche. Time will tell.

Most users don't know what segwit is, but all users want lower fees.  Segwit reduces the fees.

To further expand this instead of using just their hands to hold 10 coins they grab a small bag and can now hold 17 coins at a time to distribute.  This would represent the capacity increase segwit provides.

I would argue it does allow for a much quicker lightning adoption. 
Segwit is neccesary for lightning adoption.  I understand that it makes full nodes more costly and lightning is probably going to happen in the next year.  No reason not to encourage companies and individuals to be ready.
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:07:09
I'm with ya, but it's entirely likely that bitcoin in 10 years could still end up being the dominant crypto with 20% dominance.  With the other 10,000 coins making up the other 80%.  BTC will be the reserve.

This phase was inevitable, for any currency to be used as a medium of exchange it also must be a store of value.  For bitcoin to maintain it's position as a SOV it needs the operating costs to run a full node to remain low as well.  That includes things like initial sync time, bandwidth/cpu/memory usage, etc.
The layers built on top of bitcoin will be able to leverage bitcoins decentralization, security, immutability, and probably most importantly it's censorship resistance.
Payments aren't what makes bitcoin valuable Visa, Paypal and other payment processors are already easier than on chain bitcoin payments.  Lightning will put bitcoin in a position to compete much better with visa than any other crypto.

- only an IOU network (more like caching layer)
- Lightning coins are not actually bitcoin (they are)
- Centralized! (it isn't and if it is, does it matter?)

It is how markets work though.  "Price gouging" allocates scarce resources most fairly.
The guy who fills up his truck with gas because he waited in line and the price is artificially low (say$2.50/gallon) when he didn't really need the gas, might think twice about filling up for $10/gallon.  This allows the people who truly need it both quicker access and encourages them to get only what they need to survive, leaving more for everyone else.

No he's playing politics, bitstamp managed to get segwit deployed a few weeks after segwit activated.  He said on cnbc segwit isn't a priority nobodies asking for it, even though by his own admission high fees are a number one complaint.  Also they don't batch withdrawals which is the most obvious low hanging fruit solution to solve fee problems.


I actually agree they should have done that for political reasons, but it would have been the wrong technical move for the technology.


This is incorrect, they're choosing decentralization and censorship resistance over "just add more blocksize!"

This is how a mature currency based on limited supply works (we're not there yet, but we could see slight effects).  Instead of changing and fiddling with interest rates...the actual price of money changes.  When savings is more desired by the population the price goes up until it reaches a point where the desire to spend is great enough and then the price falls.

Lightning development is quickly working it's way to being deployed on the main net. Once that's completed people can start using it and services/startups will likely race to get solutions ready for payments.  Bitpay, coinbase, wallets or some other company or startup will integrate lightning payments. It'll be similar to how bitpay worked, except better because all transactions will clear instantly instead of having to wait for confirmations and for near zero fees.

Oil will have value for at least another 10 to 50 years minimum, I'd suggest investing a fraction of that wealth in bitcoin as a hedge against oil.
Bitcoin is perhaps the best hedge against over inflated fiat currencies.  Oil also has some value in this regard, but will eventually be a thing of the past.
Short term maybe more like 10% or less (50% is very aggressive and risky), and reevaluate later.

Yes, They will either become centralized or run into high fees.  Lightning Network allows bitcoin to remain as decentralized as possible and still do instant microtransactions.
Also, LN is more useful than on chain payments.  Transaction are settled instantly and therefore instantly spendable. No waiting for confirmations.

All those laws should be repealed and price gouging should be encouraged so the much needed supplies can more quickly get to disaster areas.

Lightning is not side chains, it's a layer built on top of the bitcoin network, a sort of caching layer for transactions.
We already have payment processor centralization (bitpay, coinbase) and no one cares.
It won't be debt obsessed because it's not built on to of an inflationary currency.
Many people are addressing this concern, also it's not as much of a concern as many make it out to be.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:50:32
I'm surprised by coinbases lack of segwit as well.  I think maybe they got a little complacent and expected the 2x hardfork to go through.  They may have been humbled by that failure and are looking at ways to adapt.
Meanwhile, most other exchanges have already adapted by batching txs and implementing segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:42:07

@_date: 2017-12-14 18:21:25
I know, those nodes will still work though, consider it a separate lightning network from the main one.  It will still work as long as you have a connection to it.
I gaurentee there'll be countless ways to connect to organizations like wikileaks.  Governments cannot and will not be able to blacklist every single node in the world, if they did another one would pop up and another and another.  There is no barrier to entry for being a node if you have bitcoin, the hardware and can get the open source software then you're good to go.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:05:15
For on chain with worldwide adoption with 1 cent fee txs clearing every single block you'd have everyone putting all sorts of nonsensical txs in the blockchain.  I'd bet 1tb blocks or more would be needed.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:10:14
It's blockchain also grows several times faster which will cause problems eventually.  Bitcoin could easily be higher if we had a larger blocksize but then we'd also have a much larger blockchain requiring Higher CPU, Ram, Bandwidth and storage requirements to run a node.
You need to understand the a tiny minuscule fraction of the the worlds transactions take place on all of crypto combined.  Even visa does 3,000 tx/sec average and MUCH higher during peak and they are also a tiny fraction of the total transactions that take place worldwide.  Not only that Eth is attempting to do more than just simple transactions.  No crypto is anywhere near ready for anywhere near worldwide adoption the technology just isn't ready yet.
This is why bitcoin is scaling off chain whenever possible to keep the main layer as decentralized as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:23:49
No it works, in the short term.  Long term it won't, not everyone understands why because it's not easy to understand.
It's ridiculous to think that every single transaction ever should be done on the blockchain.  With worldwide adoption you'd easily need 100gb probably closer to 1tb or even 2tb.  Especially if you wanted to keep the the fees low enough to do microtransaction and allow anyone to put any trivial tx they could ever think of sending for a penny or 2.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:39:47

Of course they do, that's why it's called a disaster.


This is nearly an impossible question to answer, how could I possibly know what would happen in a disaster with and without price gouging laws.
I do know that price gouging laws lead to long lines and hoarding, which causes resources to run out.
Also, the most powerful force in disaster relief is human generosity and in second place is greed.  I want that guy who buys generators and water pumps from 2 states away to risk his life for profit or generosity.  Whichever motivation gets him there is ok with me.

This is definitely a problem that is known and there are solutions being worked on and considered.  Including a blocksize increase of some sort.
Here's one solution that was proposed last month:  
Also, once you have an open channel with the Lightning network you could receive bitcoin to that wallet directly from an exchange that has an LN wallet.  Solutions will be developed that will make it so you don't have to constantly open and close channels.

Bitpay hasn't innovated in years, they should have been contributing to LN development this whole time.

Fee's will be based on the amount being sent, because the real cost is  in LN is the capital "locked" up in lightning nodes + cost to open channels.  So there will likely be a base minimum cost + a low percentage of total transacted.

I'm not positive but, If I were to guess it was more a situation where once they started developing things got more complex. They started thinking of new/better/more things lightning could do.  With the added complexity comes increased time to properly code something that transfers other peoples money.  Something that just cannot be rushed like a video game release.
Getting very close now though with testing being done on mainnet as well as testnet.

@_date: 2017-12-21 13:51:41
It'll likely help yes it's a huge step in the right direction. fees will not go to zero though.
Consider that with the current on chain capacity would allow everyone in the world to make a single tx every 25-50 years.  There are solutions being worked on including a layer between the main layer and lightning.  It'll be a sort of decentralized funding pool for lightning channels.  Then there's other improvements like schnorr and mast.
Once, all these improvements are completed in the next couple/few years we'll likely hardfork several improvements that can only be done via hardfork + a probable blocksize increase of some sorts.

LN testing and development has been underway for years and has come a very long way.  On chain scaling won't work long term especially if you promise to keep increasing blocksize no matter what to keep fees low.  Everyone and their grandma will offload every stupid tx and useless piece of information to it.


There's a question of how much increase is needed, there's also been a few proposals since then that will greatly reduce the amount of on chain capacity needed.  Since, as everyone should know by now whitepapers aren't religious or holy texts that must be followed; we can safely do something other than what the whitepaper theorized.

Most other coins aren't decentralized, and don't have robust development for real actual scaling solutions.  I mean, they can just increase block size, but on chain scaling doesn't scale.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:07:17
I agree with you entirely the current situation is not ideal and does price out the poor for regular payment transacting. It doesn't however price them out for SOV or transfer of value because you can send a low priority TX and wait.
I'd prefer if we'd get an increase in the blocksize.  It'd also be great if the larger companies in the space would implement segwit.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:26:16
Sorry you didn't like my reply, if you don't want my thoughts don't ask.


You're asking the wrong questions, it's more important to ascertain if the bitcoin supply is becoming more distributed or less. The current distribution is interesting but less important than the trend.
Bitcoins supply may be more centrally distributed than ideal, this however doesn't make bitcoin itself centralized.   It is also hard to measure since the largest wallets are mostly exchanges where the bitcoin belongs to hundreds of thousands (millions?) of people.
Further, bitcoin is distributed better than pretty much every other crypto and I've yet to see a better way to distribute a decentralized currency.

Not a problem, I believe coinbase has segwit by default now so you should get segwit benefits both ways if you're now using a segwit address.  Although sending from coinbase you don't get to pick a fee so you'll likely pay more for sending from coinbase.

Yes, but segwit would allow miners to get fees from those thousands of tx per second on the payment channels from opening and closing them.  Rather than the current situation where they don't see a penny from them.

No crypto-currency is anywhere near any sort of mass adoption for payments.  Digital gold/speculation is the only real use case BTC has at the moment that could get any sort of mass adoption.
It's going to take a few more years for BTC or any other crypto-currency to be ready for mass adoption/payments.  It'll get there but it will take some time and a whole shitload of code.  This is the main reason why Bcash and others are putting the cart before the horse; the tech isn't ready for this sort of adoption yet it's too hard for the average person to use and understand.
 
In the meantime early adopters will get to tinker with lightning and help pave the way for a more mainstream friendly bitcoin.

Classic implies it's a completely different implementation.  Cash could easily be misconstrued as "better" way to spend the bitcoin you own or some sort of payment channel for bitcoin...it's not a huge deal as long as those that support Bcash aren't dishonest about what they are.  If roger were to use bitcoin.com to promote Bcash or worse promote bcash exclusively that would be very dishonest and probably fraudulent.  The only way Bcash IMO should get the name bitcoin is if segwit fails horribly and bcash becomes the undeniable winner.  Of course at that point you'd be better off just keeping the name bcash to avoid branding yourself as something that failed.

No, they can't operate fractionally on LN.
Also If a traditional bank were to be built on top of bitcoin it would have a much more difficult time doing fractional reserve anyway because of that pesky 21 million coin limit.  Fractional reserve can be easily done now with very little risk to insolvency because central banks print money and the government insures the banks deposits.
If any normal bank built on top of bitcoin was acting with fractional reserves and had a run on the bank like coinbase just experienced and they would likely become insolvent.  Coinbase is probably 100% reserves or at least near 100% if they aren't and the community hears about it they would likely become insolvent because anyone who kept their BTC with coinbase are taking a more significant risk.

if bitcoin becomes mainstream we're probably going to need more on chain capacity regardless of layer 2 solutions.  the question is, how much?

Me too, the main reason there's not much else going on is that we're in a holding pattern until segwit activates and one of the only things actually happening with bitcoin right now is the price.  I would expect to see more technical discussion/news/etc in the next few months.
I'm looking forward to seeing lightning wallets and also how the capacity increase from segwit effects the network.  Should be interesting.

Higher the barrier to entry the more centralized it will become as a rule of thumb.  I'm assuming we're talking about the cost of running nodes. right?  The more expensive it is to run a node and verify txs, the easier it is for governments to target and regulate.  If suddenly the only nodes are only data centers, the network runs a much greater risk of being co-opted by both people who have misguided good intentions and/or more nefarious actors.  At this critical point this wonderful experiment will have failed because it will have been compromised.
This is what we're fighting for.

Copy/paste from previous reply to you.
The point is that people cite "satoshis vision" and use it as a one size fits all bludgeon in arguments rather than spending the time to produce a technical argument about why something isn't decentralized or censorship resistant etc.
When People do that it makes me think they don't have any sort of thoughts or actual points of their own.

I like to say the money in an LN channel isn't locked up, it's freed up.  Money in an LN channel will be much more useful and fungible than on the main chain.

It's completely different.  If an alt-coin becomes successful longterm then it has some sort of value/utility to it's users because there's no one forcing anyone to use that coin.

I define "satoshis vision" as the way to some people think we should scale bitcoin or at least I think that's the way people are using.  This is why people shouldn't go around citing it without technical arguments.
The principals of bitcoin are what're important to me and I believe  the people on r/btc and r/bitcoin both still follow those principals.  We just have different ideas about how to properly scale bitcoin to achieve those goals. If bitcoin ever deviates from those anarcho-capitalist principals I'll be jumping ship, IMO it has not done that yet.

With a deflationary currency spending would come from a longer time preference and savings rather than a short time preference and debt. People aren't going to magically stop wanting or needing things, currency does people no good if they never use it eventually.
This is a better system for everyone (especially the poorest in society) because you'd no longer be paying things back at interest.
The current monetary system enriches banks by encouraging you to spend and pay back at interest later.

Why would it take 10 years for him to save up for this harvestor?
Why does it only take 5.8 years to pay off the harvester?
How much does it increase his profitability?
What if the harvester only makes him 1% more profitable after making payments on it?
What if the guy who saves with a deflationary currency buys a harvester 10 years later and gets much better equipment for the same price because of improvements in technology. he would then be more competitive and reap all the benefits without having to make payments+interest to the bank while continuing to save money in a deflationary currency.
Maybe after saving for a year he finds a different opportunity that'll increase his profitability and since he isn't stuck with a loan on that harvester he's able to take advantage of it.

LN is still a trustless Network.  It really doesn't matter that much if there's a few very large hubs, they either route your payment or they don't and if they don't there'll be a different path that will.  As an added bonus unlike on-chain transactions there's increased privacy as they have no idea where the payment originally came from or where the end point to that payment is.

It needs to be more stable to be generally accepted and used for payments by people other than enthusiasts.  That doesn't happen until it has more adoption as a store of value/transfer of value. 
It also needs to be more useful as a payment method than visa or apple pay. That won't happen until lightning is released and lapps (lightning apps) are built on top of that infrastructure.

It still is part of the "vision", everyone wants peer to peer micropayments.  Some people want to do it via exponential layer 2 scaling and others want it now with linear more blocksize inefficient scaling.

From my understanding transactions can be routed through other trust-less intermediaries to allow these transactions to occur.  I admit I'm still trying to understand this tech, it's fascinating.

I totally get that, but there is high priority vs low priority txs.
Many (maybe most) don't need to be in the next block.  Give customers the option and let them know that it could be days until their tx goes through. 
Because of their choice to always have every transaction in the next block, people are overpaying when they don't need to. Especially wen they can wait a while and don't have a high priority tx.

This is incorrect, off chain payments in the lightning network are peer to peer. 2 of 2 multisig.
Read this FAQ to understand more: 
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:17:01
Absolutely, there needs to be a big obvious pop up warning to let the customer know that their transaction might not be confirmed for days and have RBF available.  In many cases that would be fine.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:27:50
The people who buy in and stay in, do so because they know that there are numerous improvements on the way that will revolutionize money.  It's already a better technical store of value than gold, it'll be so much more than that in the coming years.

Your likely to be right adoption will be slow at first. However, given how insanely useful LN is, i think adoption will increase very quickly at some point, especially if fees on chain remain high.
LN is unparalleled for payments and micro payments.

This is misleading, the number of transactions in a block depends on the types of transactions.  Not all transactions take up the same amount of space.
There was a block a couple weeks ago Block  which was 1.5mb and had 3,706 transactions (well above the number of transactions from non segwit blocks). Which means the block was 52% larger but had 75% more transactions than the "average" block in your example.

it's not 1 sat fee per transaction on lightning it's based on amount transacted.  He may have only routed 500 transactions at $20 each for \~.05 cents fee each. 
How much any particular person charges is up to how they set up their node.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:49:17
The question then becomes what sort of resources are required to run a reliable 99.9% up time LN node for a x number of tx/s?  I honestly don't know the answer to this question.
Also, using phones as lightning nodes could be perfectly feasible for a small businesses or other edge cases.

According to your numbers you'd need a blocksize of roughly 500mb blocks.  That's 72gb a day 26.28 Terabytes per years and would not be able to come anywhere close to handling peak traffic and that's only to get to visa level which is a fraction of total global transactions.

Go ahead, you wont catch me saying that.  although I do believe Store of value first currency second.  It'll only truly be useful as a currency once it stabilizes and that wont happen until it's more widely adopted as a store of value.  If it's not useful as a store of value it becomes less useful as a currency.
My stance for the last three years has been that additional layers will scale bitcoin better and with more use cases than you ever could on chain.

I agree, but core is only doing what they collectively believe is technically best for bitcoin.  This is the way development should be done, it should not be politically motivated.
If another group has a different direction to take bitcoin their is a mechanism for that and they should do it. 
Unfortunately, all other groups who want bigger blocks refuse to pull the trigger because they want it all, full control of everything bitcoin.  They cant have that and neither can core.  So instead they've been holding bitcoin hostage.  
Now that many users are speaking up and saying they want to do UASF they're crying foul over the very same thing they were threatening to do.
The best thing that could happen is an amicable split and I really hope it happens. Because regardless of who is right it's really holding back bitcoins potential both for big block and small block proposals.  Let the split happen and may both sides prosper or neither or one.

Extension blocks could be implemented if segwit is activated.  It is not incompatible.  Yes their current proposal would have to change a bit.  The big change being implementing segwit on the main blocks rather than only on the Extension Blocks.  This has been discussed and may even be the way they end up doing it anyway.

Fine I'll bite maybe you have some morsel of knowledge that I don't.  What reason is there for a mining pool to only include transactions larger than 10Sat/byte.  Don't say spy mining because that's not it.  Spy mining typically result in consistently empty blocks rather than blocks with only certain tx fee rates.

Currency or bitcoin? Because bitcoin has a few extra properties that normal currencies don't.
Off the top of my head store of value, remittances, censorship resistance, permissionless, and fungible.
If you compare bitcoins properties with any fiat currency it is a better money and eventually it'll be a better payment method.

All crypto-currencies are bad for payments compared to using almost any other payment method.
Crypto-currencies are great for many things, payments are not yet one of those things.
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:31:42
The path is determined before the payment is sent and each person along the path only knows where it came from and where the next stop is.  In fact they don't even know whether the next person is the intended recipient or not.
If I understand it correctly each hop is basically unwrapping a layer of the transaction that only they are allowed to know.
I'm not entirely certain exactly how the path is chosen, I would suspect it's done by checking channel states to find the optimal path.
I think this is all correct.
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:25:31
If we went ahead with segwit2x, we likely wouldn't have seen as many companies implementing ways to use scarce blockspace more efficiently.  It's important to continue to find ways to use blockspace better before increasing the blocksize.
Further much of the reason against S2x was the way it was proposed, announced from a closed door meeting rather than using the BIP process.
FWIW, I didn't downvote you, but I usually downvote someone who says they know they will be downvoted; you did ask for it after all. Maybe avoid that in the future. :P

Which makes sense as cryptocurrencies aren't very useful for payments yet.  Too volatile, difficult, and fees are unpredictable for any crypto with substantial usage.
Bitcoin is only useful currently as a speculative asset, value transfers, and store of value (long term). So the current network use makes sense.
Bitcoin will be useful for payments but not until there's more adoption to stabilize the volatility and the lightning network/other payment solutions are built on top of the main bitcoin protocol.

On paper yes, and so far in practice as well but only on a long term time preference.  If you are using it short term for store of value you may get rekt.

@_date: 2018-02-12 20:09:51
Coinbase is responsible for ~58% of on chain txs because they don't do batching and haven't yet implemented segwit. Combine that with gemini and a few other small exchanges doing the same thing and you got your answer.
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:05:43
Stable coins are only stable because they are pegged directly to the US Dollar.  So they are inherently just as inflationary and broken as the Dollar is.  So they're really only stable until they aren't. 
Bitcoin will only gain stability when it gains more adoption.  It's going to be a bumpy ride but I believe it will get there, don't underestimate Gresham's law.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:48:37
No, segwit is opt-in.  Segwit use will rise as lightning is adopted and more services switch to it as the default.
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:16:46
So you're suggesting that bitcoin.com is the only mining pool to figure out that not including 10sat/byte or less txs increases their profitability?  The same mining pool that mines any and all transactions on bitcoin cash no matter what?
Especially when orphan rates have been only about 1 orphaned block per month?
Or is it that bitcoin.coms infrastructure is so much poorer than the rest of mining pools that they can't afford to risk including cheaper transactions?
None of this sounds absurd to you?

With a simple payment channel between 2 parties they are only limited by the time it takes to send and receive in that channel (less than a second).  It's difficult to figure out the current TPS limits of LN, but it is very high and will only get better with further development.
Here's a good read describing some of the limitations of LN and solutions for these problems.  No FUD, just information.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:45:55
I honestly don't disagree, however what can be explained by malice can also be explained by incompetence, stubbornness, or laziness.  I think these reasons are more likely given the people involved and the extremely low orphan rates.
Of course, sacrificing $100 to $1000 to get a slightly higher chance to get $125,000 as you suggest could be valid reason.
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:42:35
When someone isn't acting in there own best interest then there's clearly some other best interest there acting upon.  
It's in every miners best interest to mine as as possible so leaving out fee paying transactions doesn't make sense.  So what is rogers reason for not including as many TXs as possible?

If bcash ever becomes the chain with the most accumulated proof of work i'd consider calling bcash bitcoin.  Even then it'd be so well known as bitcoin cash that changing it to bitcoin would still be confusing as hell.

Reformatted your post, hope you don't mind.
- Gold can be faked - a btc cant
- gold cant be split for transactions easily - btc can 
- Gold is hard to store and heavy - i can carry 20mil in btc in my mind / a sheet of paper / a usb stick Gold is not indestructible and if not stored properly slowly erodes - btc lasts forever 
- New gold will always be found - btc is capped forever New altcoons beeing created doesnt matter they are not bitcoin, its like saying new metals are found, it doesnt affect gold either.
 
But do what you think is right, gold will work as a negative correlated asset to the market but IMO bitcoin will do the same maybe even better.

Personally, I'm ok with 2mb blocksize increase (like many other in that poll), and I think there's a large part of the community that believes that would be safe.
The Problem with s2x is it changes governance model, it's rushed, there's not a proper development team supporting it, less than 50% of ecosystem is in "support" of it, there's only a handful of nodes, and it doesn't give enough time to see what effect the segwit capacity increase and LN deployment has on the network.  The safest way forward is to implement mast and signature aggregation then HF with other wishlist upgrades.
It cannot be said enough that keeping nodes cheap to run is the most important thing to secure bitcoins future.  If nodes get too costly to run the music stops and this little experiment ends.

I have read your comments and I disagree, a few people in a backroom deal are trying to change bitcoin if they succeed and there fork becomes THE bitcoin a new precedent will have been set.  Right now they can say "we have no power"  That will not be true if they somehow succeed.  That said it is very unlikely to actually succeed, more likely it's just going to cause a whole shitload of disruption.


Timing is everything, and doing a rushed hard fork right after a softfork that literally did the same exact thing (capacity increase) plus more is an absurd way to do things when billions of peoples money is on the line.

Maybe I've been paying attention to different sources...but I've had the opposite impression.  I figure we'd still be summer 18' for power users to have working lightning implementation.  Maybe spring on the optimistic side, could even be a year away though.

Mostly because a handful of businesses can't change bitcoin.  Their fork will not succeed in becoming THE bitcoin.  If it does and they are the only ones running nodes it will be trivial to regulate and change bitcoin into whatever the fuck people want.
This fork loses one of the most important things that secure bitcoin. Power users, the ones that run nodes and spend absurd number of hours studying and reading about bitcoin.

There's been a lot of discussion...but discussion is just that...discussion.  That is talking about different ideas, part of the process.


No, it's kind kind of the worst decision mostly because of lack of support and this point:
- Bad governance model (Centralized) exposing the S2X Network to numerous governmental and regulatory attack vectors. If all the other negatives didn't exist, this alone would be reason for me to not support this fork.


Actually only 2 of my bullet points and they are very important ones.


Not the case at all. I'm actually ok with an additional blocksize increase and think it will be needed short of some magic solution


My simple answer to this is that we really need to be pragmatic.  We aren't dealing with some insignificant change to some software that doesn't really effect people...we're dealing with changes that effect peoples money and livelihood, it's important to get these things right the first time or we set back the entire ecosystem for years or decades or maybe forever.  Once some changes are done they cannot be undone.  We're trying to change the world for the better, that's not easy and needs to be done correctly.

That's not the real problem with doing a 2x HF (relatively simple change).  The real problem is adoption, getting the entire ecosystem to upgrade in 3 months is pretty much impossible even if it wasn't extremely contentious.
When Hardforking the goal is one of 2 things..
1. To create an altcoin for whatever purpose 
2. To upgrade the protocol.
In the first case no problem, just implement replay protection and good luck.
In the second case, get consensus/code the upgrade, test relentlessly, test again, test another few times and allow the ecosystem sufficient time to upgrade (at least a year maybe more).
S2X isn't either of these scenarios.  It's attempting to be an upgrade but without consensus.  Make no mistake this will be messy but only for the uninformed and the people involved with S2X.  Bitcoin will continue to be bitcoin because I run my node and verify.
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:30:41

That's not really the most important reason against 2mb blocks right now.
Here's the rest of the list of reasons against 2mb now:
- Rushed, better to schedule the HF for at least a year ahead.
- Hardforking just to double capacity is ridiculous, better to implement many other changes w/blocksize increase on the Hardfork wishlist.
- A better longterm blocksize increase plan that can be soft forked down if needed is the better path.
- Best to wait and see how the current capacity increase (segwit) effects the network along with lightning network adoption.
- Other Soft fork improvements like Signature aggregation and mast can be implemented to increase utility and capacity even further
Reasons against S2X specifically:
- No replay protection + hiding nodes to trick network.
- Bad governance model (Centralized) exposing the S2X Network to numerous governmental and regulatory attack vectors.  If all the other negatives didn't exist, this alone would be reason for me to not support this fork.
- Lack of user support
- Lack of business support (only ~30%)
- Miner Support will follow value of chain vs difficulty level
- Rushed
- Only a fraction of nodes run BTC1 Vs Core
- Businesses are dropping out of the NYA, none have been newly added

If a user has 100,000btc that user has a more significant impact on consensus than someone who has 1btc.  Dumping 100,000B2X coins will have a huge impact compared to 1.  Not sure how that's hard to understand.

They are easy to spot, just look at the charts, when node count doubles in a matter of hours, those are clearly sybil nodes with no value.


I didn't say that, there are only 2 things that determine the value of nodes. That is, how much bitcoin they represent and how many users/txs they represent. 
If that node in your basement represents 100,000 bitcoin, that node would be pretty important even though it only has 1 user.

Almost no one said that about BCH months ago.  Anyone who knew what was going on knew it would be a minority fork with little support.  Several people (including me) have been begging these people to fork off for a while, if they want to do it...then do it already FFS.
Also BCH had replay protection S2X currently has more economic support (~30%) and 92% miner support but virtually zero community support, dev support, no replay protection and is missing the other 70% of economic support. Which makes it more disruptive and insane than the insignificant BCH fork.

Yes, but that congestion really isn't a problem for how bitcoin is scaling.  Eventually the Bitcoin blockchain will likely always have some amount of variable congestion.  On chain transactions for individuals will be rare and lightning will be cheap, secure, common and fast.
Yes there are short term issues with this while lightning is being developed and adopted, but scaling the best way aint easy.  It really is best to face the pain now and get people implementing ways to use blockspace as efficiently as soon as possible rather than continuing to encourage people to build unsustainable business models that use blockspace inefficiently.  The longer it's encouraged the worse the problem gets.

I know we want increased adoption but it's probably best to steer people who want to accept bitcoin for smaller payments to LN solutions rather than on chain solutions.

I could maybe see that, will that be enough to maintain bitcoins sovereignty from governments? Datacenter nodes are an easy spot for governments to "attack".
I also think it's reckless to just bump up the Block size everytime you reach capacity.  The ideal solution is to get second layer solutions working as soon as possible and then bump the block size up as needed.  In order to do micro-transactions we need second layer anyway, and it's better to do it now than later.

It'll likely never be implemented into the bitcoin client, that's why it's called a 2nd layer solution.

Except this superior tech is patented (enforced by government) not something that is at all desirable in a decentralized system that relies on free market competition to maintain the network.  Not only that but it blocks numerous improvements to the protocol and may even encourage mining empty blocks.

It works on Litecoin currently, there's work to be done still but it is not vaporware.  
You're likely going to eat those words, there are multiple versions of LN being tested and implemented while you rant.  Yes there are still issues but with 6+ implementations competing to get to market with the best product, i'd say it's only a matter of time.

if we don't implement layer 2 functionality another coin will.(ethereum is going to be implementing the raiden network)
If miners don't get their shit together everyone in bitcoin loses.  even if lightning is implemented and no one ever uses the main layer anymore (very unlikely IMO) Lightning and other layer 2 solutions still need to settle their transactions on layer 1.
Also, everyone knows that miners need to make money to secure the network properly.  There is absolutely zero chance that is going to be ignored by anyone in the community.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:24:12
It's patented tech that only one group gets to use and it also prevents numerous upgrades to the bitcoin protocol, because those changes would break AsicBoost.
@_date: 2017-05-03 00:39:29
I'd just like to point out that ASICboost isn't just an efficiency gain, the big problem is that it makes it profitable for the one company who can use it to block protocol upgrades because any change to the header would break their supposed covert advantage.  Not only that but from my understanding ASICboost doesn't increase network security in any meaningful way.
Also, the POW change was only brought up when Jihan Wu threatened to attack the other chain in the event of a split.  Yes other people have been championing this occassionaly but it's not a serious consideration unless it absolutely has to be done.  Merely an area of research like it always has been.
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:18:35
If Lightning network works out as advertised then LTC isn't likely to see scaling issues for YEARS.  If it comes down to BTC failing to implement segwit (thanks to a mining cartel) and therefore not getting 2nd layer solutions as soon.  I could see a scenario where LTC could be a robust competitor.

I get it, I'm not against raising the blocksize personally, but a solid well tested and reviewed upgrade is being delayed for political reasons.  Segwit also has the benefit of being widely supported by a super majority of the prominent people in bitcoin.  If we are going to hard fork we should probably make it count with other desirable upgrades that require a hard fork along with a block size increase.

as long as nodes remain affordable for ANYONE to run them the main chain will be decentralized and then anyone can build off the main chain in whatever way they desire.  I believe the markets will work as long as you keep governments from screwing with the main chain.
Keeping the barrier to entry to build off the bitcoin is the way to go.  Once you have nodes that need server farms to store every single transaction ever, then it becomes a lot easier for governments to regulate, control, and change.

You may be right, we don't know yet.  That said, I'll take the off chain centralization tradeoff over on chain every single time.

A few points to consider:
- Every new user to the lightning network will have to open a channel, so at the very minimum there will always be that traffic. Block space has also been shown to be very valuable to many other use cases than just payments.
- It's also unrealistic to record every single transaction ever made directly to the blockchain.
- Bitcoin will never be able to do micropayments without lightning or some other layer 2 network.
- Layer 1 will always be necessary because it provides undeniable proof that businesses and individuals have been operating honestly
- No one is going to neglect paying miners a suitable amount because without them being paid to secure the network, this all falls apart. 
The bottom line is that Layer 2 will happen with or without segwit eventually, even if has to be done with specialized hardware.

Arguably a majority, according to coin.dance support without weighting it's 20% and with weighting it's 46%.
Not exactly an overwhelming majority, therefore no consensus.  Eventually we may have consensus for a a blocksize increase but there are so many other things we can do to increase capacity.
Also, hard forks should never be this rushed it's hard enough to get consensus on a longer timeline for a soft fork.  The timeline should have been longer.

Probably a little of both.  I own a side business and do not yet accept bitcoin, mostly because the platforms I sell on don't allow for bitcoin payments.  Also, the vast majority of the demographics I sell to don't know wtf bitcoin is.
I do plan to put all my products on open bazaar, but that is not a priority for me currently because of my customer base.
Looks like we'll be getting segwit which is a step in the right direction to get 2nd layer solutions going.  We'll also see other improvements like schnorr sigs.  
We may even see 2x HF get implemented, although that is a drop in the bucket as far as scaling is concerned.  I'm optimistic despite Jihan Wu and friends being giant man babies about segwit.

It's a result of the markets for asic manufacturing.  If there wasn't such a centralization of Microchip manufacturing in Asia there wouldn't be nearly as much centralization in mining which would make it much more difficult to form cartels.  Jihan wu, and his friends own roughly 40% of the total hashrate.  That's pretty significant.
So not really a bitcoin design flaw but more a problem related to other markets.  Not entirely sure the reasons why those markets are so concentrated, I'm sure there's a reason.
I suspect (hope) that in a couple years we'll get some more competition in ASIC manufacturing and that should go a long way to help things.

LN clears near instant, on chain takes 10 minutes.  One of the neat things about LN is you could send 400 payments around in 10 minutes from person to person with the same bitcoins and it would all clear just fine.  Try doing that with 400 unconfirmed TXs using the same bitcoin on chain.

More accurate is greedy and power/control seeking. Also, it does not imply that the only way to full blocks is mining cartels, as you stated increased adoption will also cause full blocks.  
The vast majority of bitcoin users currently are using bitcoin as digital gold which is very low traffic compared to payments.  Payment technology AND adoption isn't quite there yet to be adopted by any significant markets as well as any significant number of their users.
Initial adoption for now will continue to be digital gold, but that will change and could change rapidly.  Time will tell.

r/btc is wrong on some levels not all.  This isn't black and white.  
The fact remains, If segwit was activated 6 months ago BTC could be doing all the things ETH is doing, because malleability would be fixed along with many other improvements segwit provides.  Not only that but we'd be well on our way to schnorr signatures and also have some very valuable data on how increased capacity effects the bitcoin network.
Roger Ver and Jihan Wu have been the main figureheads blocking segwit the whole way.  Without enabling second layer solutions bitcoin will not be able to compete on the same level.  
I believe Jihan doesn't want second layer because he believes that is stealing his revenue and I don't know wtf is Rogers deal, probably just wants to pump his alt-coins.
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:17:48
I don't see it that way.  If the main layer remains decentralized then who knows what could be built on top of it. Worst case scenario for me is that TX cost gets so high that no normal person would use on chain tx (only govt, banks, etc).
My point is we have time to see what happens with LN and in the meanwhile implement more efficiency upgrades to bitcoin.
Also, you don't know how centralized off chain will be; no one does.  I do believe second layer needs to happen though, because if we do every single transaction on chain then there is pretty much zero chance bitcoin can remain decentralized.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:32:38
Segwit is part of an overall scaling road-map and there is no permanent scaling solution available that is properly peer-reviewed and tested.  I believe developers are scaling bitcoin safely and responsibly. 
There will be a hard fork in the future, and it will have consensus and probably numerous improvements likely including some more permanent scaling solutions.  In the mean time it's ridiculous to be holding up payment channels, atomic swaps etc.
Also, the notion that 2nd layers aren't part of bitcoin is like saying HTTP isn't part of the internet.  
Segwit does plenty for miners it allows them to get fees for microtransactions and small payments that they would otherwise never see, because if lightning doesn't get implemented then those transactions will have to be routed through "trusted" 3rd parties rather than a trustless payment channel that opens and closes on the blockchain.  
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:51:22

It's easy to say that now, but alt coins don't have scale therefore no scaling issues.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:14:58
maybe, maybe not.  I'm not a dev, but if a majority of the competant devs that I know of say 3 months isn't enough time then I believe them.
It's also not just about testing there's also the time required for the rest of industry to test/update and make any necessary changes to their software and for all nodes to update. 
Every single node and company that doesn't update gets removed from the network and stuck on a network that wont function properly if 99% or more of the hash power goes with the fork.
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:44:41
It makes it harder to form cartels and because of that it would increase the cost of spamming the network because you wouldn't get as many of your fees back in the blocks you mine.  You also wouldn't be able to wield power over other miners because you would no longer be the only viable hardware manufacturer.
It's much harder to convince 50 people to do something unprofitable to force change on the network than it is to convince 5 people.

"LN is solely for normal person-to-person payments."
I figured it'd be better for payments to buy goods and services from companies because they would always be online and maybe even run their own LN node.
LN always struck as something that's perfect for buying things in person or online. Value transfers between individuals would be better to do directly on the block-chain at least until lightning use is more common.

I've heard a lot of these arguments but not from miners, I've heard jihan says he doesn't like the "arbitrary" weight given to witness data in a tweet.  Note: the weight given was not arbitrary it was chosen for technical reasons and may be tweaked in the future depending.  I suspect they have real concerns but they have not done a good job communicating them and I suspect that comes from arrogance and ignorance of how the bitcoin ecosystem really works.
Simpler malleability fixes does not mean better. It's not always that simple. 
That said I don't really disagree with your overall position, I believe segwit is a good solution, and I think large blocks will be be needed. I'm for the NYA agreement but I dont like how rushed the HF is, it's too short of a timeframe for testing and for the entire ecosystem to upgrade.
Segwit + schnorr should give some breathing room and data on how the moderate capacity increase effects the network.  Then we can move foward.
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:44:05
I generally agree with you, I think we are kind of on the same page mostly and I share your frustration with the community.  That said, if nothing else it does make bitcoin more anti-fragile and I believe that is a good thing because if bitcoin doesn't remain decentralized it will have more and more corrupt influence controlling it.  God damn is it frustrating though.
I think You're also likely correct about the timeline.  I hope the community can somehow rally behind the 2mb HF, even though the timeline is very reckless.  It should give us ample time to implement other upgrades and get lightning running and move on to another HF eventually.  Or not who knows.

Segwit is a good solution and should have been activated 6 months ago.  If it was then we would have lower fees than we currently and be well on our way to schnorr signatures, lightning, and many other scaling improvements.  Depending on how all that goes we'd then be looking at a hardfork with numerous other improvements.
Instead we have nothing because of a short-sighted mining cartel.

Because some miners feel like they are being cut out of the deal.  In reality this sort of 2nd layer solution is going to happen, the choice is whether it happens on bitcoin or some other coin.  I believe that some miners have a view that they are going to process every single transaction on earth for x amount.
That's not going to happen though, because 2nd layer solutions are going to happen either on bitcoin or some other coin and that sort of tech will be nothing more than legacy.
That said miners need to be compensated and I believe they will be, blockchain space is way to valuable not to support blocks that pay out enough in fees to secure the blockchain.  Afterall, if the blockchain doesn't pay enough in fees to be secured then it all falls apart.

This is the key to why bitcoin should be hodled.
