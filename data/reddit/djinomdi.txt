Very understated problem, also very interesting.
I would advise against every solution that includes burying or hiding some paper/steel/titanium wallet somewhere. Assuming bitcoin success you don't want to spend 20 years wondering if someone built a hotel over your wallet, or forced your safe  or whatever could happen far from your reach.
I think you want the wallet with you. But you can't trust your memory because you could either go crazy overthinking it or you could fall and hit the head or whatever.
You could not either implant yourself some hidden microchip, as in 20 years bioscanning for implants could become the standard.
The only thing so far that looks to me feasible is a series of steganographic coded tattoos. That means that the seed is hidden into else regular looking tattoos. How this is performed must be further thought, i'd say for example chromatic differences in the edge of the tattoo itself could carry informations, also micro-interruption in the ink stream and so on. You also want those redundant for you can get wounds and scars over them.
Wish you good luck.

reminds me of "accelleration of time" in Cosmopolis, what a great movie

plot twist: mmm dumped and shorted the market since 2013 and now just stopped because exchanges got angry.
Turns out this last rally is just regular bitcoin growth.
