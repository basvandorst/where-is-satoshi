@_date: 2017-09-10 16:17:57
Thank guys. I just bought $250 worth now at $4,190. I'll see how the day/week goes to buy the rest. 
That was my thing: I didn't wanna be "greedy" and wait for a sub $4000 dip and it shoots back up to +$4500. I bought now and feel good

@_date: 2017-09-10 17:57:25
Yeah although BTC ATM are more prevalent, the cost is outrageous. It's more about the progression of the BTC movement IMO
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:02:05

Surprisingly, It was $4256. My fat ass was there again a couple hours ago. Let's not talk about that... 
Anyways, It's WAY more expensive at ATM, but it's somewhat anonymous. Ehh...
