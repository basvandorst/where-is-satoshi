GDAX, change it from a line chart to a depth chart over to the right
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:05:30
Watching it on the depth chart was insane though. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:43:14
Bitcoin is Accelerator confirmed
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:01:16
I just use GDAX for the charts. 
Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but Coinbase and GDAX are the same thing right? Coinbase at least uses GDAX as their benchmark for pricing. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:44:59
Yeah this dude was a lot more optomistic than most people.  He was right, mostly
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:42:34
Possible not plausible is the difference

No ios app? 
RemindMe! 3 months
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:13:14
Thats pretty well done actually, compared to what most sites do
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:02:14
Are these ads in any way influenced by my subscriptions or browsing habits? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:30:55
Ive been waiting for this. The 1300ish rate wasnt gonna last. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:04:14
Im so glad I already have Changetip so I can get this .1 cent you  and the other guy sent
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:14:36
Whoa, at this rate Ill get a whole dollar. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:32:41
Thanks again.
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:57:02
Changetip didnt even send the smaller one so yeah
@_date: 2016-06-21 04:09:28
I did make a dollar. 
I need to be on more. I was just checking in to see what was up with the huge dip a few hours ago. 
Ill also tip. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:25:42
I dunno, the correlation in the charts is pretty strong right now
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:06:38
Holy shit someone gave me 5 bucks 3 years ago and now its like 40 bucks.  
Thanks for making me check actually though
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:27:04
The Euro is also tanking, so people all over Europe are buying dollars, yen, and bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a currency like any other. This why this is news for bitcoin users
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:41:24
Hah thanks. For the .002 cents or whatever. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 06:07:05
This is the best one
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:09:41
Right now I have like 68 bits. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:58:58
Both. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:47:44
Little of both I think
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:50:40
People will buy literally anything other than Euros and GBP, and they want to get rid of those currencies cause they're becoming less valuable. 
Bitcoin is easy for the little guy to trade quickly. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:21:34
How about surpassing 1,711,787 ZWD?
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:19:05
I honestly feel like this is an ad. Two MacBook Pro posts in like three days, plus this account only posted once in the month before this post was made. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 05:20:32
But why? Youd think people would be buying it more now
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:55:26
Psst OP its possible that Reddit itself bought ads from google and for some reason Google ads spat out instead of Probably because BTC is bitcoin’s trading symbol. 
I’m saying this because I don’t think google lets people buy ads for their own subreddit.  If they could, soammers would oretty easily be able to direct people to instead of or something like that. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 05:41:46
... It says right there in the article. He shot a cop woth a crowssbow
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:15:37
Admins have clarified that asking for your own post or comment to be upvoted is okay, just telling others to upvote/downvote other people’s stuff or content in a dofferent community is not. Look at or for example
I don’t actually know what was removed though. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:09:20
Keep in mind that people are also kind of nervous cause bitcoin went so high recently, so its easier for it to fall quickly too. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:01:59
Okay I’m never selling again. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 05:40:26
Im suddenly less sad about that. Still fee sad for his kids though.

This is the first one.  This is the one that deserves to win[.](
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:27:17
Used to be Reddit gold only, admins made it sitewide a year and a half ago or so. 
Gold is pretty useless now. RES and normal reddit do literally everything it does. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:52:55
Pretty sure that's the same exact
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:35:43
We need the ACLU or someone to get on this. 
There needs to be a good case with standing where the person involved wants to get into a five year battle too. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:40:44
The real question here, did you actually buy the Playstation with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:06:50
This is good thinking. 
But the problem with a decentralized system is that there’s literally no way to do this. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:05:48
This is modifying the PATRIOT Act, which specifically is about money laundering from foriegn gangs and terrorist groups. 
A lot of things are fucked up about the PATRIOT act, but this section of it does not allow the government to do the same things to uninvolved US citizens. 
The real thing that’s fucked up here is Civil Forfeiture, which is a seperate issue from this law and more worrying for bitcoin owners.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:20:57
The DOJ already had that right. Hell, bitcoins have already been seized as civil forfeiture. 
I’m not really arguing with you like you’re wrong, I’m arguing that this story is a non issue because our rights are already severely conpromised. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:40:10
Part of the reason I don't deserve this roi.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:38:48
Right. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:02:38
This is talking about modifying the PATRIOT Act. 
The PATRIOT Act’s anti money laundering sections specifically talk about non US citizens participating in crime and terrorism. 
This isn’t some wide reaching attack on literally anyone who uses bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:36:46
I would never do anything for Reddit gold. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:02:21
Every god damn time[.](  I need to start checking usernames more
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:40:14
Because the Playstation likely will cost more in a little more
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:31:01
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:08:07
Please please please can we switch it around a bit to BuTC
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:09:47
Yes because the DOJ handles mone laundering
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:06:33
Well, the scale you're looking at in the chart I linked is from 9,050 to 10,050.
I'm sure people do have money orders at 400 or whatever but I have not seen them. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:35:29
I actually bought in at 100. 
That first 20 dollars is now 200, somewhere in my wallet.  
I do not deserve this roi.
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:06:04
Oh huh, get on Counbase customer support on that then
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:48:59
Without context this sounds like something a really bitchy girl would say. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:28:26


At a very simple supply and demand level, yes. The more people who want something, the more you can sell it for. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:57:32
Exactly. That's literally it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:33:18
What[’]( your plan? 
Can you buy bamboozle insurance with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:53:49
People on theleft are yelling "I'll buy bitcoin at this price" and people on the right are yelling "I'll sell bitcoin at this price" and the actual sales meet in the middle. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:55:25
That's not a jump. 
What you're looking at is a chart of who is selling/buying bitcoin at what price. 
Imagine all the people on the left in green are yelling "I'll buy Bitcoin at 200 bucks a bitcoin" and all the people on the right in red are yelling "I'll sell bitcoin at 300 billion bucks a bitcoin."  Obviously, neither side is going to get that deal, so their orders/offers remain undone, but still available as offers if the price of bitcoin actually does make it to one of those levels. 
The line in the middle is the average of what is actually being sold. 
So basically, that huge cliff you see is thousands of people promising to sell everything the moment BTC hit 10,000.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:10:09
I'm theoretically doing homework right now. Gotta make a cutlist and a set list and a prop list. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:41:34
Its a play
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:03:21
4th Amendment is already gone for bitcoin, civil forfeiture is fucked up

@_date: 2017-11-29 03:28:02
Well, that chart is collating everyone's offers together.  
Jim from Ohio is selling .01 at 300,000 USD while some bank in China is selling the other 29.99.  Its an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:08:56
The law does not work that way.  By your logic money orders are treated as illegal as well. 
There are a ton of things that are defined in US criminal law that aren’t illegal in and of themselves.  Like computers or communication or vehicles or weapons, just because they’re defined in the USC does not mean they’re illegal. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:46:00
Admins don’t global ban people just because a mod said to. If a developer got banned from the entire site, something else happened that the admins didn’t necessarily tell us about.

Pretty sure that’s a pump jet propulsion yacht. 
It spits out water really fast instead of having a propeller.   Same difference between propeller aircraft and jet engines, except pump jets arent as nearly universal on the sea because water is different.

Any comments? Will you give me a ride in your helicopter?
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:47:32
I actually know a surprising amount of people who thought a jetski has a little propeller on the bottom of it. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:41:12
Oh okay that checks out. 
That and btc writing a bot to harass me jusr because I commented here are pretty dick moves

I know that for larger Navy type ships it can... but a jet ski can’t right?

Changetip is what got me into bitcoin. Wish they hadnt killed it, it was a good introduction to bitcoin if nothing else
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:26:43
The reason it died was too many people were afraid to spend. 
You gotta use it for it to be a currency
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:30:42
Something is going to happen today
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:58:49
To be fair, I was like 17 so 120 bucks was a lot to me. 
But yeah. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:47:30
I honestly dont see people blaming bitcoing.  They're just using the word Bitcoin like dollar or yen, trating it like a currency.  And thats what we want right?
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:45:49
^ This is how you trade currency. 
I personally bought half a bitcoin in June 2015.  Ive spent 180 dollars of bitcoin in the last week, and now there's really no way I can lose.  Worst case scenario, I made like 60 bucks. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:47:22
Frankly, its also less pretty. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:34:16
No way this is gonna hold.
