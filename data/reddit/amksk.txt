Thank you! We share the same opinions :-). But watch out, the app does not work as a wallet, you just insert your address. This is for security reasons (waiter does not have to have access to full wallet)

Guys, we need to spread the awareness about crypto with our surroundings. Ask in restaurants, coffee shops and pubs, whether we can pay in crypto. Support businesses, that allow this. Remember, you can speculate AND USE crypto at the same time – just buy the amount you spent on an exchange, easy like that.
I am trying to explain crypto to my friends and family. I am also doing presentations in my area that explain Bitcoin, Blockchain, etc.
I have also made a free Android app that helps businesses (coffee shops, restaurants, etc) accepting crypto easily. Currently for crypto fans (they need their own wallets / storage). Check it out on [ moonposapp.com](
It is not just about the technology, for me, it is mostly about the philosophy and that is what I am sharing firsthand. If you spark the interest about "Why use crypto", people will want to hear "How it works".

If you haven't found a solution, try out [moonposapp.com]( It is a simple app that allows you to generate QR codes for payments to your public address that you set up beforehand. Therefore there are  no private on the device, so you can have your wallet somewhere safe (like HW wallet Trezor).

I am actually working on a "crypto currency point of sale" Android app right now. It should help supporting payments in crypto pretty easy for any restaurant/coffeeshops/whatever. PM me if you are interested in the progress.
