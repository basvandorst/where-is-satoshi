First off: I am not affiliated with BTC24 and I am also an affected trader with several hundred € and a few BTC currently frozen.
A few things/thoughts:
* Simon did not run off. He posted on reddit yesterday and I was in contact with him (online) AFTER the freezing/shutdown happened. I have no reason to assume he will try to leave 
* Of course it was foolish to take part in this kind of business with (apparently) not the required expertise to operate such a service fail safe. Every experienced programmer will not argue that no matter how good you are errors HAPPEN but I agree that the posts on SO show a lack of experience. However what happened did happen and there is no way now to reverse it.
* Everyone is now angry and upset about the SO posts but it seems that almost nobody wants sees the whole picture: **The trading engine had bugs before which lead to a loss of money but this (obviously) was completely replenished by his own funds, maybe stuff that he took from the deposit/withdraw fees, maybe his own private BTC funds. That would have been a point where he could have just blamed a hack or a software bug without compensating the loss** Nobody cared about these SO posts before because eveything was fine and everyone got his money. Now some issues arise and everyone is marching with his pitchfork. I am not saying that what he did was right or isn't a severe issue but you have to see the whole picture.
* As pointed out by the TO Simon most likeley has enough work to do at the moment to try and fix things (legally and code), so any harrasment or legal threats will only do one thing: delay progress in this matter
* Everyone of you knows that bitcoin itself is experimental and highly volatile. Everyone knows that you should not invest more into bitcoin than you can affort to lose. Past experiences have told us that every large exchange sooner or later has security issues/leaks, so this is something you have to be prepared for. **So everyone who puts money into an exchange thinking that it will be safe there forever is plainly shortsighted.** It does not matter if it is due to a bug, a programming error, a hack or something similar **you must be prepared to lose the money/BTC you put into an exchange**.
* Everyone who put a significant amount of money into BTC24 (or any other exchange) hopefully checked the background of this exchange. Not doing any basic research before trusting any people with your money is careless. Checking the background would have provided the the following information: The exchange is run by 2 german citizens as Ltd in the UK with a liability of **1 EUR**. When you evaluate these facts it gets obvious that **if** someone/something gets fucked up and the owners **should not be willing to work on a solution** you will have very little chances to ever see your money again. This is the second point where every clear minded individual should only invest money he is prepared to lose.
These two last points may be uncomfortable but they are the truth and everyone with common sense was aware of that unless he let himself blind by the extreme growth of BTC value. 
As Simon pointed out somewhere on reddit he is waiting for clearance by his lawyer what details of the incident and the next steps he can share and I am fairly certain he will publish a public announcement as soon as possible.
