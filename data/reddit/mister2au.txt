Context is everything here ... 
The Bitcoin/cheque comparison is in relation to its place in the overall economy. Neither 'business sector' generates physical assets and the core value is in the service of transferring money - this is a sector with low barrier to entry and limited competitive advantages. Which also plays into the riskiness of crypto-currencies as a long term store of value given the potential for Bitcoin to be displaced one day.
Buffet has started that is not a sector he wants to be in.
The comparison is NOT around the minutia of which how that money transfer is affected.

What is clear is that he somehow gained control of around 400k bitcoins on, or prior to, June 2013.
This was used to capitalise a network of Bitcoin related companies, which in turn appear to have used it to acquire a lot of IP from entities related to CSW and receive a 45% cash rebate from the Australian government - effectively monetising 45% of the bitcoins.
I suspect there was a SN smokescreen in place to avoid the question from Aust Tax Office about where the 400k BTC came from, or to possibly to initiate the control of the 400k BTC in the first place.
It seems to all gone belly-up when the ATO decided that the 45% R&amp;D grant was not applicable where the R&amp;D was acquired via a BTC transfer between related entities.

I think you've hit the nail on the head as far as the ATO stuff is concerned.
So, most likely, fantasy IP bought from his family trust using fantasy BTC he invested as equity and claiming real cash R&amp;D credits.
And this also appears one of a number of potential frauds across his group of companies.
Anyone else surprised that he might have claimed R&amp;D credits for "supercomputing research" where that research is most likely just a huge mining setup.

His point is that Bitcoin has no sustainable competitive advantage given the simplicity in what it is trying to achieve ie money transfer. 
He is not literally saying it an electronic cheque but alluding to Bitcoin being a payment mechanism - that is broadly the market space it DOES fit into
The sub-text is that is a service that is easily replicated other than the first-mover advantage which reduces over time (and he is a long term investor not a speculative investor) eg
* IBM in the PC market
* Nokia is the phone market
* Microsoft in the MP3 player market

Perhaps you'd like to explain how you got the seed money to start a position on BTC because frankly most teenagers are not going to be able to do that without wealthy parents giving them a head-start.
You claim $4.8m in assets but even with a 20x increase in bitcoin over a year, you would have needed $250k seeding as a 17yo ... does raise some questions
Or lets pretend you started at 15yo and the seeding is only $50k, that still raises a lot of questions.

Whereas a smarter approach (and Satoshi's original approach) was a slow build-up as an electronic payment system for things like internet payments and transitioning to a broader currency 
I must also admit it is not helped by all the dodgy exchanges speculating on price - which really do make it look Ponzi-ish ... sadly if it was $5/BTC and had no bubble, then the mainstream would be faster to accept

Terrible argument ... you need to learn your history a little better.
What you attached was a critique of an extremely early and incomplete Ethernet-type proposal from 1974. It was a further 2 years before it made it to a workable idea.
The failing here was not the memo writer but was on the part of Bob Metcalf in not being to able to articulate his early ideas. 
In terms of Bitcoin, that is more like the responses to half-assed 'digital currency' ideas from the mid-2000s ... before someone had bothered to come up with a workable idea/protocol.
Also note that Ethernet was a completely new idea in an era of analog communications. Bitcoin is only a distributed/decentralised version of electronic banking that we already have. Chalk and cheese !!

There are quite likely assets somewhere - I wouldn't bet against that.
I would however bet quite heavily that this was caused by a fraud of some sort, with my money being on Mt Gox dipping in customer funds (either to fund the business or people using it to speculate on prices) and getting caught when prices started to slide.

I would almost guarantee that Mt Gox were trading their own book quite extensively. The big question is which side they were on?
* were they dumping volume against customer buy orders to liquidate positions? dumping phantom coins on the sell side? also very possible can would explain the bull run might have caught them out
* were they perhaps running trades on the buy side recently to artificially create a bull run to $1200 on Mt Gox (with other markets following) and allow insiders to off-load on the new exchanges? people can drip-feed coins at $600/BTC now where it was $100/BTC 6 months ago.
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:00:33
"borrow" customer coins and sell to fund the business with the intent of buying back using future commission ... prices take off and get majorly caught out ... I'd believe that
Not what I would guess at personally but in all honestly, absolutely possible ... people with vested interest usually are in denial that prices could collapse but fully expect price to boom - the only reason I'd bet on it being the slide after the $1000+ prices.
EDIT:  of course there are also left-field scenarios like government seizure given everything that went on with Silk Road ... the unlikely scenario is a misunderstood modern-day hero who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and is working hard to get everyone's money back 
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:44:19


You are implicitly assuming 1BTC can only make 1 transfer per year .. which is obviously wrong
The numbers are more like:
* $4 billion annual transfer
* $600/BTC current price
* 1 hour from fiat-&gt;BTC then BTC-&gt;2nd fiat
So you would need coins averaging:
* ($4B/yr) / ($600/BTC) / (1transfer/hr)  / (8760hrs/year) = **761 BTC** or $450k
It is such a tiny amount because of the speed of the transfer. There is pretty much no way money transfer can impact the overall BTC price - even 100% of that market would only be 76k BTC 
Now, if people decide to hold the BTC after the transfer that is a different matter but that is more from speculation or other uses rather than the transfer component
Hope that helps some people
@_date: 2014-03-11 10:59:53
There was a major shortfall of cash - something like $20-$30M depending on which numbers you believe.
Mt Gox also had (based on the lastest leak) 450k BTC above the customer deposited BTC.
A simple conclusion is that either:
* using customer cash to cover operating costs (and then paying withdrawals from BTC sales or future customer deposits)
* speculating in BTC with customer money
This 2nd possibility is how a lot of company run into fraud problem when a market downturns. It could be a cause after the market peaked ad fell in late 2013 ... 
Or it could just allowed hackers to steal BTC, cash converted on BTC and MT Gox's own BTC ... possibly through direct Mt Gox hacking not issues with the BTC protocol.

Suppose you find that it NSA or CIA project? Suppose you also recognise that the blockchain is not anonymous? Does that change your thinking at all?
Suppose you find it is an individual with 2 million bitcoins who is just waiting to dump them on the market and effectively kill of bitcoin.
It is newsworthy given its currently a $8 billion economy.

The most interesting bit if that is true - they were thought to be holding 951k BTC against a customer deposit of 501k BTC (which was 624k in the leaked doc) ... implies Mt Gox were supposedly holding 450k non-customer BTC which would be the owners stakes plus commissions still held in BTC.

There is no way to know.
Current prices are not based on value transfer but rather mining costs and speculation. 
International transfers are so fast that it should not be a driver of value ... Under your scenario maybe something like $1/BTC for all BTC are used for that purpose

You want to walk us through that a little more slowly? 
Sold to who? Are you suggesting they notionally sold (or sold fictitious BTC) to customers without the equivalent blockchain transactions and took the fiat from the customer accounts to their own accounts?
ie. they swap real customer cash for BTC that only appear in customer's Mt Gox balance but aren't real.

@_date: 2014-03-10 10:34:40
The price is in no way related to utilisation - classic bubble behaviour.
Looking just at the Mt Gox leaked data - they have had deposits and withdrawals of nearly double the number of released Bitcoins - and that is only one exchange. Sort of implying every circulating coin (remembering a lot of are just "banked") has been deposited and withdrawn from exchanges 3x, 4x, or 5x .. .
Compared that to the percentage actually used for buying real goods/services - I'd be surprised if it was 1 million BTC.
So you basically have speculators moving maybe up to 10x-50x the volume of the underlying economic activity. It really is classic bubble behaviour
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:20:32
Sure - that a given ... 
But my question is why THESE ones appear on the API output given they are clearly still in Mt Gox control ie what is a 'withdrawal' ?
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:28:06
Just from trading I can tell you that is incorrect, so I grabbed the data to be sure.
Using the biggest 3 exchanges (Bitstamp, Bitfinex and BTCe):
* trading volume since recent $700 high: 8 days / 26k average
* trading volume since all time high: 100 days / 60k average
* trading volume since initially breaking $200 until peak (the bull run onwards): 35 days / 74k average
So the big bull run was driven by abnormal buying volumes, which then eased off after the peak. The last week and half since the $700 high have had extremely low volumes and definitely not big player selling off.

It's a fair question and pretty much the only real reason to know who Satoshi is ... 
Exchange volumes average around 100,000 BTC per day with relatively balanced pressure on the buy and sell sides. I'd guess you could liquidate 10,000-ish coins daily (day after day after day) without hugely moving the market. Then add in non-exchange methods like localbitcoins, criagslist, etc
I'd guess you could liquidate 1,000,000 BTC over a few months ... BUT (and it is a huge but) if people noticed this all coming from the same large 2009-2010 wallet you'd probably have a lot more people trying to get out at the same time.

Scenario: Mt Gox had coins before the shutdown but have since traded/sold them to someone else who had nothing to do with the Mt Gox problems. How do you get that coin back?
Answer: You can't without penalising an innocent party. For coins still at Mt Gox, that is EXACTLY what bankruptcy is for.


Nope - not obvious. Addresses are anonymous - how do you distinguish between a stolen coin and sold/traded coin if I told you my where stolen but I actually sold some to somebody.
One of the features that attracts people if that once a transaction is doe, it is final. This means you dont need to know who you traded with (ie anonymous) because the coins are yours forever.


Lets say I take 90 clean 50BTC addresses and 10 stolen 50BTC address, and combine them in a single 5,000BTC address. All of the old addresses are now zero balance.
I now create 100 new 50BTC addresses by splitting the 5,000BTC.
Which 10 of those 100 new addresses have the stolen coins. You cant tell who they are going to because it is all anonymous.
Or even more simple, I deposit 50BTC and sell it on an exchange. I now have cash and the stolen go into a huge exchange wallet and onto a new owner. But with so many transaction you cant tell who the new owner is and you can't fairly take the coins off them anyway.
Hope some of that helps.

Not only was it in NYC ...
The 2nd transaction on that wallet occurred 19 Aug 2011 - the 1st day of the first major Bitcoin conference which happened to be in NY. Let's pretend the 1st tx was a test, a friend, simply forgotten or didn't fit the nice story.
And they were somehow affiliated with the conference: 






There was every possibility that transaction was one of 75-odd attendees - one of whom was presumablythe real Satoshi.
The total transaction was 1.85BTC which sounds just for $10 BTC price and the price of 2 crepes (based on menu prices and the offer of 1 crepe/lemonade for 1.0BTC).
So its actually not completely unreasonable for the story to be true - however remembering 1 face 2.5yrs later is a bit of a stretch even if it was the first customer.

Cut your losses and run.
Let me explain where Mt Gox is at:
* all the BTC are gone, so your 31 BTC is now 0 BTC
* they had $30m owing in cash, so your contribution (based on 31BTC) would be around $1,000 you'd need to contribute
* then there would be legal, restructure, new infrastructure &amp; working capital requirements ... so let's call that another $1,000 from you (and others to get to around $30m of cash to re-float Mt. Gox from nothing)
So, the proposition is
* Mt Gox goes under + you lose everything; OR 
* creditors (including you) take over + you pay an additional $2,000 to get a hope of 1/30,000th share of some future profits
What do you do now?

Wow - do some banks suck this bad? You must be American, yeah?


Extensively. $0 fee and cash in local currency for me unless I use unbranded ATM's in things like convenience stores then a fee applies.


Generally curious how? It requires ALL merchants to have Bitcoin infrastructure and that comes at a cost roughly akin to current debit card infrastructure.


Same or next day depending on whether international clearing is required.


Yep ... zero cost electronic funds transfer. As with bills, same day or next day if it requires international clearing.


Just as an FYI, decentralised is actually the standard spelling outside of American English ... [sic] is not required
**&gt;Bitcoin is fast and it's cheap**
**This is probably the most interesting point - do people see that cost advantage staying as more robust Bitcoin infrastructure is put in place. For me (non-American) transaction fees are fairly trivial so Bitcoin's cheapness has no attraction.**
**Perhaps the problem this is solving is the AMERICAN banking system?**

Tumbler/mixer followed by sell-off seems likely to me, or just a straight sell-off.
After that depends on the size of balls you have:
* take the proceeds and pay-out Mt Gox customers at $135/BTC and walk away without legal problems
* keep the money claiming they were personal coins and claim all the customer coins were stolen ... rich but potential legal issues
I don't see paying Mt Gox customer in BTC as a likely option given IMHO it is lose/lose - don't really clear all the BTC debts (whereas arbitrage and convert to fiat does) and doesn't allow MK to walk-away filthy rich

It's basic maths dude ... and you got it wrong by a factor of 1000x 
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:26:58
Still having trouble with your logic ... 


By end of 2010, there were 105,000 blocks discovered ... so thousands of different customers is completely possible given Mt Gox was essentially the only exchange


Initial mining was 50BTC/block so that is ALL that customers could have created.


You can not determine which transaction in the chain was the transfer from customer to Mt Gox, customer to customer, Gox to Gox.




These are both patently false ... Just looking at the top-most branch of the transaction tree:
* 50 BTC created 17-Nov-2009 (
* consolidated to a 22,500 BTC wallet on 19-Nov-2009 (
* traded again as part of a 13,800 BTC move on 1-Oct-2010 (
* consolidated to 400,000 BTC wallet on 27-Jan-2011
The coins were mined from 2009 to 2011 not all in early 2011 and basically all (if not absolutely all) have been in circulation. 
For the chain I listed, how can you possibly conclude:
* Mt Gox mined the coins starting in 2009 before they even existed as a business in Jul-2010; or
* it is the Jan-2011 move that transferred the coins to Mt Gox - yes as you say strange ... why it is not the Oct-2010 transaction that transferred them with the 400k just being Mt Gox tidying up internal accounts
Why do you keep saying it is 1 miner or an organised group? That makes absolutely no sense.
**TL;DR: Basically everything you said (especially the "never been in any circulation") directly contradicts the blockchain info and the verifiable info gave ... this is obviously an internal shuffling of Mt Gox accounts from EARLIER customer transfers**
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:25:13
Plenty of reasons:
* Bitcoin was in all likelihood going to be some obscure micro-payment system and this was alluded to early on ... no-one really expected it to take-off like it ... I mean, damn, people were giving away thousands of BTC early on just for shits and giggles.

Excuse my ignorance, but why does this preclude this from being a Mt Gox account?
This looks like consolidating ~200 accounts and 400k coins in early 2011 ... Why is not possibly transferring individual "accounts" to a single Mt Gox "account" ?
For my education, how can you say these haven't been "deposited" to Mt Gox prior to this 400k transaction or using this transaction?
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:47:53
Firstly lets address the ignorance ... USD is not even 20% of world money supply and is roughly the same size as Euro or Yen ... even the Yuan will overtake the USD by the time BTC is even close to be universally accepted. 
Next, I will remind you that America is one of the most conservative countries when it comes to this stuff ... you can't even replace paper dollars bills (or go metric) without half the country getting up in arms ... status quo rules
Lastly, the US government has been the most aggressive in stopped USD being converted to BTC by regulated financial businesses ... there is no way in hell the US will be the biggest adopter of Bitcoin - you can look to Europe and Asia for that

It is an unpopular question and you WILL get a lot of opposing responses to it.
But I think it is actually a fair question if you:
* firstly recognise the "regulation" of exchanges is not the same as regulation of Bitcoin itself.
* secondly then I think you need to define what regulation is if it isn't regulating actual bitcoin use
So if you define regulation as standard financial market practices like regular audit of holdings, separation of customer funds from company funds and possibly (just possibly) licensing of people running exchanges - then I think you have some argument to be made in favour of this in order to fairly protect people without crossing into privacy or use-case issues
You'll notice ALL American bitcoin players already need comply with anti-money laundering provisions including customer identification.
You can't however venture into regulation where around the actual use of bitcoin - that is completely a no-go area
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:59:09
To use the example in the other response: bread.
We can all agree bread has an intrinsic value - it can be eaten - it has a purpose.
Can we agree a dollar value for bread? No - because that depends on how we define the dollar, the supply/demand for bread and for the dollar, etc .. But it still has intrinsic value in a conceptual sense. It has value to us even if it was worth no monetary value ie free.
Virtual goods &amp; official currency only have extrinsic value because that is what we agree they are worth. If we agree they are worth nothing then they have no use (unlike free bread).
And yes this is a philosophically challenging distinction that we could argue for hours :-P

Wow ... interesting economic theory - debt has proven to a very good way of reallocating capital to maximise value growth. 
But anyone who over-spends their earning capability will run into trouble whether is peseta, drachma, euro, dollar or bitcoin. 
Bitcoin won't change that ... it will result in a very slight reallocation of capital in western countries (from financial institutions/investors to the masses) which may or may not be the more efficient thing.
In 3rd world countries it *could* give some protection against the local currency - but, like you, I am also a sceptic given the expensive technology (ie. permanent mobile internet access) and need for people to use local currency for most of their living anyway.

I'm sure those who got foreclosed during the GFC would love to hear about the 5-10% housing growth !
EDIT: guess I should be clear that I think it's fine for people to speculate if they want, but it's actually solid advice that Bitcoins are not a good "investment" at this stage ... No-one can guarantee they will still be here in a few years - all it takes is a few governments to regulate so that banks can't provide fiat services to anyone involved in bitcoin and the game is over ... not saying it will happen but just 1 example

Mentioned in other threads that this looks like standard behaviour from Mt Gox hot wallet code - ie each hour or so (upon confirmation) split each packet randomly between 40-60% in each of two new packets until every one is below 10BTC.

@_date: 2014-03-12 16:26:26
Actually yes it can ... 
Don't know about other countries but In Australia it is real-time clearing for what transactions the banks wish to push through.
I suspect what you are referring to though is why customer transfers take so long - that is because they batch up all customer transfers and typically settle once day a day to keep all their accounting/tracking nice and easy. 
In theory there is no reason they couldn't do it hourly and then Bitcoin isn't needed for that at all. But in practice, most people just don't care about a 1-2 day delay.

I'm not disagreeing with you, but thought I'd add some solid numbers to explain why this isn't happening.
Debit card processing fees (for small businesses) are typically 0.9-1.2%.
Most businesses need their sales converted to local currency to facilitate running their business - might not be one day, but is true at the moment.
Most BTC facilities charge around 1% to convert to local currency.
* compared to cash, BTC is 1% more expensive.
* compared to debit card transactions, it is more or less line-ball
Credit transaction are different, in that you are paying a surcharge for fraud protection, ability to chargeback, reward schemes ... and in most jurisdictions retailers are able to charge a credit card surcharge.
So there are some saving against credit card but that just reduces the loss the retailer cops if they aren't charging a surcharge.
So while I don't disagree, the numbers just don't stack up at the moment
The exception will be any business that transact their behind-the-scenes in BTC as well (eg labour costs, supplier costs, taxes, etc) ... at the moment that is almost no-one but might expand one day
tl;dr - it doesn't actually reduce costs (at the moment)
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:12:12
Yep - you get an accounting loss but don't get the tax deduction until the loss is realised

One of the issues is that there were a VERY small number of early adopters with vested interests in seeing the price grow as fast as possible while not really caring about the actual usefulness of the technology.
So much/most of the "community" discussion through 2011/12 was about getting the 2nd level of interest from early adopters. Weaknesses that were openly discussed int he crypto and finance communities suddenly were not acceptable to discuss any more, and we settled on small numbers mantras to repeat over and over.
The really dangerous part now (after the late 2013 bubble) is that we are seeing a lot of that 'pump and dump' behaviour being finalised by these serial entrepreneurs as they move onto the next big thing.
I am not sure which was it goes from here .. maybe the circlejerk group are correct ... or maybe (and what I lean towards) is that the bubble was actually artificially created for a small group of insiders to crystalise their profits (think the BTC Foundation founders &amp; Mt Gox for starters)

Oh don't worry - I see your point .. being an internet smartass is more fun than actually participating in a discussion 
EDIT: nice ninja edit ... BTC infrastructure is more than a phone and internet access. There are some serious question that need to be considered:
- who will pay for and provide ATM type services ... the machines don't come free and how do you continue to ensure anonymity 
- what will proper regulation and security do to your costs of cashing-in and cashing-out BTC?
But my original question is what are individuals attractions to BTC? "new-ness and novelty value" is a common one but the weakest one. Cost is a far one. Anonymity is fair. Speed seems a wash - businesses can insta-clear funds in most countries, individuals have faster ways than BTC as well - remembering the transactions need to propagate through the distributed network.

Once again, this is being taken out of context.
Warren Buffett was expressing his view that he would not recommend **INVESTING** money in bitcoins because of the risky/speculative nature of them.
He is completely correct - in essence no-one can really justify the value beyond "cost to mine" which highly circular: 
- high value =&gt; investment in mining rigs =&gt; higher hash rate =&gt; higher difficulty =&gt; higher processing requirements =&gt; higher mining cost =&gt; higher value
**He is commenting on (conservative) investors not the merits of the technology which he compliments numerous times**

wtf are you talking about ? Where the f**k did you pull 200% from and why are you using 200x.
200 x $24,000 = $4.8M sure ... but that is not 200%
and when was BTC at 1/200th of its current value ... like 4 years ago ...

That looks pretty spot to me ...
The Bitcoin velocity is more or less known - lets call it 1 hour for full transaction confirmation ... actually lets call it 2 hours (ie 4000 transaction per calendar year) and be conservative because it make the maths easier.
You get ($400B * 1%) / (13M * availability * 4000)
Or equivalent to 1/(13*availability%)
So even if you use only 1% of the total coins it is ( 1 / ( 13 * 1% )) or about $6 ... use more coins and it goes down
Do you think that sounds about right?

Actually it is more a backlash against the degree of smugness/arrogance amongst a decent proportion of bitcoin "fans" ... you see it amongst religion, environmentalism, politics and basically any arena where one side says "I am better than you"
I don't think most people begrudges anyone the right to invest in whatever they want, but I do know a lot of people who are COMPLETELY sick of having Bitcoin preached to them ... and I think that is fairly representative of the mainstream
You will see a lot of responses typically like "they are jealous", "they are too stupid to understand" and other fairly condescending attitudes. This is the real problem that stop the mainstream adoption of BTC.

You could go and buy lots of different BTC/altcoins &amp; BTC/altcoin companies but that isn't really all that diversified because they will all tend increase/decrease at the same time.
You could opposite position to protect against losses in one or the other - but again all you are doing is buying one exposure and selling the other ... it's exactly the same as just taking a smaller position
In highly liquid markets there are more clever things you can do - but will big buy/sell spreads in BTC and BTC-related stocks this is not going to happen

By 2040, more than 99.6% of the available Bitcoins will already have been mined. There will really be little incentive to invest heavily in mining the residual and transaction fees will be the new game.
Most mining is a lost currently and the amount of new super-mines being established is only making that worse.
I'd expect a possible step-change at 1/1/2017 as the block reward halves, effectively doubling the cost of bitcoin mining in what looks to be an already saturated mining market.

I keep hearing this as an excuse for bitcoin. And frankly it is probably the weakest of all reasons - using technology just for the sake of it ... that is, it's new and high-tech so it must be good.
What economic problem does this actually solve that was broken in the 'old way'?
* It potentially lets me (as a 1st world occupant) make some international transactions at lower fees. eg 1% rather 2% via traditional banks ... and this is only because of thinner/riskier infratructure and regulation so it debatable 
* Allows people in less stable countries to hold international currency 'easily' ... but again this was more or less always the case anyway
The only real attraction is the supposed anonymity then and technology for technology's sake?
**EDIT - in case people missed the point ... I am asking what is YOUR attraction given simply stating "new technology" is a pretty weak argument. Some have made good points of speed and costs for residents of some countries (yes you Americans!) ... thank you to those that bothered to articulate their views**

Well the splitting algorithm looks like the legacy code (that was leaked) for the hot wallet to allow faster transfers.
So this may be deliberate behaviour, or just a side-effect of moving the coins to the hot wallet.
If I had to guess I'd say the coins now become a manageable size to push through mixers/tumblers on their way to never being seen again.

Perhaps you should re-read it because it has some interesting points to discuss, such as:
* does the vocal-ness of the Bitcoin community on non-important issues (like doxxing people) work against it in the view of the mainstream 
* does the genius of the Bitcoin protocol matter if the next layer (exchanges, ATMS, mining, etc) is unreliable and untrustworthy
* given most people will continue to use fiat for most things does the conversion costs to allow intermediate BTC transactions and more complex processes overwhelm the benefit for a lot of people
* will regulators strangle the inputs/outputs of the bitcoin network due to tax, money laundering, etc
* can existing system adapt and price BTC out of the market given the advantage of not needing fiat-BTC and BTC-fiat conversion
**Note: I am not arguing for or against any of these point ... But SOME of them are worth at least discussing**

Under that scenario, there are 624k customer Bitcoins owed by Mt Gox and last traded at $135/BTC before trading was halted. So basically $84.2M owed in BTC and they were also something like $20M down in fiat.
Take 180k BTC and sell them off at $600/BTC on another exchange and that raises $108M - enough to cover the value of Mt Gox coins and all fiat shortfalls.
He doesn't need to explain anything other than we recovered some BTC, liquidated them and fulfilled all our obligations to creditors. 
Anything that is left is his to keep. So supposing there are another 500-600k BTC (and that 750k was not actually lost), he walks away with $300M in BTC after all Mt Gox debts are settled. Nothing anyone can do.
But anyway, I was actually another likely outcome in my post - that he settles with customers at say 25% of their debt ... a lot of them would take those coins and sell pretty quickly after their Goxing ... 
@_date: 2014-03-13 08:22:29

Anyone that has worked  in financial trading environments or financial fraud investigation for more than 5-10 years could have told you the likely outcome.
These things always follow the same process when they go bad. The 'red flag' is the excuses why people can't have money back and delaying tactics - inevitably so people can cover their tracks or try to "gamble" their way out of trouble ... seen it with banks, trading firms, individual rogue traders, betting syndicates, individual with gambling issues, etc, etc
People who get themselves into these troubles have a psychological makeup that leads them to believe they are smarter/more infallible than others - and that they can get out of the hole. And it is ALWAYS some external factor/someone else's fault that it went wrong. You will never get personal accountability.


This is the EXACT fingerprint of just about every Ponzi scheme as it goes under. And in that I include every ill-run business where the owner dips into customer funds and it all goes horribly wrong.

Because your maths is completely flawed?
Lets pretend you are correct with 1% of $400 billion per annum ... that is, roughly $11 million per day 
Assuming the remittance needed to be BTC for 1 day on average (sometime it might be hours, sometimes many days) and 12.5M in circulation ... 
**On that basis, BTC should be valued at $0.90/BTC** ... even assuming only 10% are used for remittances then $9/BTC is the correct number.
So sorry the valuation DOES NOT hold up on the basis of international remittances.

Then I think you have your answer
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:45:24
Firstly, you are saying $7B in BTC to cover $4B in remittances so it can **DROP** 1.75x not INCREASE 1.6x ... so to around $350/BTC from current prices
And secondly, each remittance doesn't tie up the BTC for an entire year ... If you assume 1 day for each remittance you effectively have 365x as many BTC in a year, so price can drop by 365x ... to $0.90/BTC 
It's actually quite simple maths if you think about

But in reality I think a lot of people are interesting in the technology without being fanatical - it is a genuinely interesting development even if isn't going to be "the new world currency" at $1M/BTC ... 
One point is the BTC needs to mature and that is a slow process - it needs to fit in with some regulation and weed out the crap parts of the community before it can really push into the mainstream ... I think doesn't sit well with people who need/want a disruptive technology and want it NOW !!
Unfortunately reddit and get a bit circle-jerky at times so anything less than fanatical backing of EVERY aspect of bitcoin will draw a lot of negative vibes - at least that is until the zeitgeist changes like it did with Mt Gox

I wouldn't think LTC could support that volume or anywhere near it.
The 3 biggest remaining exchanges turnover around 70k BTC per day, so I see 3 options:
* could be for partial payout to Mt Gox customers
* MK 'washes' the coins through mixers or gambling sites and feeds onto other exchanges over the next 5-10 days ... and then does a runner with the money
* sell the coins directly onto other exchanges over similar time frame gaining 180k * $600 = $108M ... this covers the value of customers on Mt Gox being 750k BTC * $135 final price = $101M ... liquidate a few more coins (which I'm sure are stashed somewhere) to cover the fiat shortfall and MK's walks away without no further obligations and carrying whatever BTC is still hidden

I agree with most of that.
Except it is not $30m missing ... it is a -$30m net balance using around $55m in customer funds vs $25m in actual cash
your "should have" amount should actually be user account balances + Mt Gox's own working capital + proceeds from any Mt Gox BTC sales.
Anything reduced from user balances just moves to Mt Gox sale proceed - which is where you were orginally going with your logic.
So in theory I actually agree there should be more like $150m "should have" money vs $55m of customer liabilities - with the difference being Mt Gox sales + accumulated commissions
My point being - the missing money is actually closer to $100m than $30m .. and that will leave a HUGE paper trail which will be very interesting if your theory is correct

The availability of miners and difficulty will reset down to the lower levels - and that becomes the new lower cost to farm. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:28:32
No idea. But it's all downwards for now.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:50:55


I think I see where you went wrong. You jumped on the greed train and it derailed - quit complaining.
As an aside, what did YOUR valuation of BTC come out prior to investing? And has it changed?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:48:48
So it hit the 200d MA ... care to explain why YOU think that is a significant measure?
For bonus points, explain why 50d, 100d &amp; 200d measure brought across from 5 day trading markets (i.e. 10, 20 and 40 weeks) doesn't change to 70d, 140d and 280d for 24/7 trading over the same 10, 20 and 40 weeks??
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:53:03
Yep - an absolute disaster.
No stationary sell orders because absolutely no-one expects a bounce anytime soon - everything on the sell side is panic hitting the bid. 
Free fall pattern there.

Nice summary.
It is blindingly obvious what his game is and you perfectly hit the key issues. I hope this post gets the visibility it needs
@_date: 2016-05-04 08:59:20
No ... he SAYS he lost them.
And therefore can't prove to the Australian Tax Office that he had the BTC that formed the basis of claimed BTC payment that entitled him to part of the $54million in tax credit.
He also claimed to lost a 'substantial' amount to Mt Gox which resulted in him not being able keep a string of his companies afloat. But then he also claims he is Satoshi (and hence would have $400 million in BTC)
None of stories add up - 99% sure this is more bullshit.
@_date: 2016-05-04 03:14:15
I'm not sure I'd guarantee that.
Things have been slowly moving from Satoshi rumors, to outsider outings of Satoshi and now to self claims of being Satoshi. At each step, there has been no-one step forward and conclusively prove these false by verifying themselves (properly) as Satoshi.
So, basically, the water have been tested because 'coming out' as Satoshi.

Tax fraud for $50+ million.
Research his company history and you'll see a string of shell companies set up to milk government R&amp;D incentives. 
Hotwire is an interesting example and you can see the likelihood of a shell-game in the administrators report which is publicly available. 
Hint: funded with $30m in BTC, failed after 9 months and trying to claim $12m in tax credits for software purchases from his own trust. zero evidence that BTC ever existed and basically zero assets in the company.
The incentives are proportional to the R&amp;D spent and CSW claimed to have spent over $120 million in bitcoin on R&amp;D to earn $54 million incentives.
When challenged by the Australian Tax Office to substantiate the claims he has developed an ever-increasing webs of stories around how managed to control that amount of BTC at the time but no longer has access to prove it - trust companies, dead business partner, etc, etc
Latest round of the game seems to be conning prominent BTC experts into backing him as being Satoshi, which in turns backs his claims for R&amp;D grants based on untraceable BTC transactions.
He will constantly claim he is negotiations with the Tax Office around the deductibility of the BTC payments - where the real conversation is around the existence of the BTC and evidence of the payment, not their eligibility for R&amp;D grants.
tl;dr - not Satoshi but there is a REALLY interesting tax fraud story there from some reporter.
EDIT: I not sure how much is public but have a look at something like  to get a feel how this guy operates.
@_date: 2016-05-06 07:13:08


And that, my friend, is exactly how one conducts a con. 
Every single piece of actual evidence has instantly fallen over like a house of cards and CSW has a left a long trail of lies and fraud through everything he has touched in the last 5 years.
But social engineering of a few high-profile people and suddenly you have the "where there is smoke etc etc" argument.
BTW - please don't call him Dr given his non-existent theology PhD
He is a con-man and a complete embarrassment to my country.
@_date: 2016-05-02 13:54:11
Simple. Let me propose this "theory".


He claimed R&amp;D tax credits (paid in cash to his companies) for investments made between his various bitcoin related companies e.g. his non-existent supercomputer.
Claims were that payments were made in BTC amounting to at least $120 million.
Tax Office eventually demanded proof of the BTC for the actual payments and the actual R&amp;D that occurred. Then the web of companies started to fail mysteriously.
Now the game has been compounding those lies with more lies to try and 'prove' the original tax claims weren't just a huge fraud. 
And that is by being Satoshi who could previously control the BTC but now not having access to prove that - hence all the fantasies about trust funds and dead partners, etc, etc
tl;dr - it's all a cover-up for a long running $50 million tax scam and is rapidly catching up with him.

Actually I believe it is 2:0 now after the Dec15 game and May16 rematch.
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:40:39
We did consider it.
And we all correctly determined it was bullshit.
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:39:57
I would typically agree that everyone makes mistakes and deserves a chance at redemption.
Weirdly, in this case, it wouldn't concern me in the least. 
Maybe it is the 10-15 years (minimum) trail of scamming and destruction he has behind him that suggests he just a toal scumbag with no chance at redemption
@_date: 2016-05-03 10:57:52
Well, he was just an average lecturer at a pretty average regional university after a series of unremarkable IT jobs. The guys is no mental giant and certainly no evil mastermind.
I suspect, in his mind, enough prominent industry figures and media coverage would be a more compelling case. Or he thought those with vested interests might be easier to con.
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:03:52
I could have a good guess.
Wind the clock back a bit and examine the interactions between:
- Lynn Wright
- Cloudcroft Pty Ltd 
- Information Defense Pty Ltd
- DeMorgan
That is all Craig Wright's old life through to around 2011-2012.
And then you have his new life and new 45yo wife: 
And we are wondering about a 24yo Vietnamese girl that pops up as Director in his companies during 2013-2014 (and the beginning of a whole new level of fraudulent behaviour).
Just an educated guess - but I'd be betting step-daughter.
@_date: 2016-05-03 08:23:04
Well - that completely covers the response I just type up 15 minutes ago. 
It is spot and I'm surprised this is not obvious to everyone. It is a good summary.
@_date: 2016-05-06 14:16:29
And those Wright Brothers trolling people by flying - what a prank !
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:15:34
Probably because he is a smug asshole who has been proven to be serial liar. 
Satoshi or not, still not a likable person.

I've had a read through these before and always amazed how awful his spelling is for a supposed genius - there are 15-20 spelling mistakes in that very small series of posts.
@_date: 2016-05-06 10:11:27
And what is your problem with that.
It is CLEARLY talking about the blockchain reaching transactional limits due faster take-up than expected.
@_date: 2016-05-08 09:41:27


Let's not.
And let's not confuse knowledge for intelligence. There is no doubt he accumulated knowledge but, frankly, there is little evidence of even above average intelligence.
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:19:17
Apparently you do
@_date: 2016-05-06 01:38:48
Trust me, we do ... typically we have very little time for hollow self-promotion and cult of celebrity. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:23:13
Nothing curious about that.
Everyone called it early and called it correctly. Total scam.
@_date: 2016-05-03 08:17:11


Because maybe he knows the legal shit-storm that will follow if he obtains financial benefit from his fraudulent claims. 
No money, no foul.
Obtaining money from fraud = jail time.

CEO of a private company running courses for CSU.
Aside from being a friend of CSW, he has huge vested interests in "Satoshi" having taught there
