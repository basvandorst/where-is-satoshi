Download desktop wallet like Exodus for free. That'll give you a wallet address to receive BTC.   
Buy ledger/ trezor for secure offline storage. HODL, don't cash out.

100% best thing to do is Dollar Cost Average. Buy BTC on the same day of the month, every month.

Does anybody actually read the sources these days?   
IT DOESN"T BAN CRYPTO PAYMENTS AT ALL - IT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES THE USE OF THEM.   
"Digital currency is a new and developing area in the Australian economy. Unlike physical currency, it does not have a firmly established regulatory framework or industry structure. This makes it difficult to apply the cash payment limit in a way that would not largely prevent the use of digital currency in Australia or significantly stifle innovation in the sector. At the same time, there is little current evidence that digital currency is presently being used in Australia to facilitate black economy activities. Given this, the Government has decided at the present time to effectively carve digital currency out from the cash payment limit"

Probably just another example of co-ordinated market manipulation from Whale traders *adjusts tin hat*. Sell big, cause FUD, smaller investors panic sell and push the price down further, and then the whales buy back in big to hike it  up again. Rinse, lather, repeat.

Sick of hearing people say Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, as if massively quantitatively eased dollars have any sort of fucking value. "Yeah but fiat is backed by the central banking system so it must have value" - which is basically like saying 'Flies eat my shit so it must taste good' ...

If those guys actually read the official policy statement they'd realise that the FCA are actually supporting cryptocurrency adoption, not looking to ban them. Fuckwits

After Bakkt's anti-climatic launch I'm beginning to think that an ETF won't do much for the market either

I agree with MichielLangKamp. And just to elaborate on the point further;   
(1) Follow a good crypto new publication to keep up to date with whats going on, I use [Cryptovest.com]( Knowing what's happening, or going to happen, is paramount.   
(2) Do your best to ignore the shillers, moonboys and promoters in this space. A great team, whitepaper and roadmap should be all you need to separate the good from the bad.   
(3) In terms of technical analysis stuff, youtube is a great place to learn basic chart patterns, indicators and tools. Once you have your bread and butter down, you can move on to wave theory, harmonic patterns etc if you feel like you need to.   
As a technical analyst myself though, I can tell you that TA should be used as a supplementary tool to your gut instinct and the global news surrounding your investment.   
Best of luck mate

You've blatantly copied this from [Bitcoinist.com]( and have not even referenced them in the post. DISGUSTING
@_date: 2019-09-13 15:26:20
  
Wow, you've gone and plagiarised another [Bitcoinist.com]( article. Seriously, can't you guys write your own fucking
articles??

Yeah exactly, that's the million dollar question. 
I guess it depends on whether you think Bitcoin will last or not. 
I'll pitch a guess that it's worth it because while Bitcoin's price is being manipulated, **I think** it still has a long way to go. I'm not a moon boy by any means but **I'm hopeful** that Bitcoin will go on to be valued more than what it is now. And because of how things are in the crypto market, if/when Bitcoin's price does begin to rise, so too will *most* of the market.
Also, right now **I think** it's relatively easy to manipulate a $270 billion market if you've got a few mill to throw around. IFFFFFF the market does begin to recover to figures we saw back in November then **I think** it will be much harder for individuals/ institutions/ kleptocratic wankers to sway the crowd like they can now. They still could, but it will be harder.
I don't believe my word is law though so DYOR, if other people have different views then live and let comment.
