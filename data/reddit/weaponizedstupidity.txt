As a bitcoin maximalist myself I have to say that the fact you have upvotes is baffling to me. 
ETH does more TXs than all other coins combined. It has the most active dev team with a very clear roadmap. Actually has useful applications built on it and half of coins on CMC are ETH tokens. Is more decentralised due to GPU mining and has less drama. Every milestone BTC hits in terms of mainstream adoption will be followed by ETH shortly.
It will again outperform BTC this year in terms of investment returns due to masternode FOMO and wallstreet adoption .

Bitmex is currently holding  29,518 BTC in its insurance fund, through all the ups and downs. Their corporate interests are aligned with success of Bitcoin.

Two people can exchange valid bitcoin transactions privately and instantaneously without broadcasting them to the Bitcoin network an infinite number times without paying any fees through a lightning channel. They can also pass on transactions from other people through their channel, but there are lot of limitations. The ability to pass on transactions makes it a network.
To close the channel one of them can broadcast their last transaction and pay the fee.

Most altcoins doubled or trippled in value over the last few days.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:17:04
The most reliable way by far is to buy when one of the two things happen:
1) BTC goes on a massive bull run. Altcoins have low caps, when BTC corrects/rests people lose interest and money flows into alts increasing their value many times. For example ETH  hit 0.025 BTC when BTC ran to 20k for the first time, but now it is above 0.050. This is the lowest gain in the whole market.
2) BTC takes a rapid nosedive, like 20% in a matter of hours or a day. People exit crypto markets and you can purchase solid altcoins with fiat money for very little. When BTC recovers people gain confidence in crypto and as BTC gains USD value, altscoins also gain BTC value. So when you sell those alts for BTC later it works out as if you bought BTC with 40% discount rather than 20%.
These are safe ways to trade where you have be either very unlucky or dumb to lose money. Also don't count in dollars, only BTC value matters.

I think that's exactly the point of Bitcoin. It'll keep appreciating forever. There is a fixed supply of coins, but an ever increasing demand - now it's very rapid due to mainstream acceptance. Later it will appreciate due to world GDP growth and fiat inflation. It's an unstoppable process imo. Scarcity alone makes things valuable.

CME and CBOE are a tiny fraction of Bitmex trading volume. Futures are also an essential financial instrument for miners and business to hedge against the bitcoin volatility.
Bitcoin is either valuable or it's not, traders are just as happy to long bitcoin with leverage. They aren't manipulating the price, they're just amplifying the current trend, whether it's up or down.

If I had to give one advice - every trade you open has to have a predefined exit point where you admit that you were wrong. If you don't have it or if it's loosely defined, then it doesn't matter how good your entries are or how often you're right - you're going to end up with nothing.

If you want the short version - LN is infinitely scalable, spin up a node and more people can transact than before. The compromise is that nodes have to be always online.
Bcash will eventually reach maximum capacity because there is a hard limit on how many transactions you can do if everyone on the network has to see every tx. Block size doesn't matter.
Bcash can never reach VISA capacity, but LN can surpass it by orders of magnitude because that's what it was designed to do.

People aren't usually taking out loans to buy TVs, if they are then they're dumb.
You take out a loan to start a business, buy property, pay for an education. The idea isn't to just be able to pay back the loan with rising wages, but also to make a profit on your investment. Lending money stimulates economic activity.
To take out a loan means to short an asset, everyone is comfortable shorting fiat because inflation is guaranteed by the issuers. Imagine the horror of a deflationary asset being used as a unit of account. A lot more people would go bankrupt.

There is 1 block every 10 minutes on average. The blocks are fixed in size. It's not possible to push more TXs through no matter how many miners there are. If more miners join making blocks go faster, then the difficulty will increase pushing it back to 10 minutes. It's always 10 minutes.

That dollar amount is just an expression of effort of securing the network. That means you would have to adjust it for inflation. It's real value, not just stupid fiat dollars.
My point is that in order to pay for mining with just block rewards the bitcoin marketcap would have to eclipse the entire marketcap of the planet and increase exponentially to infinity and that doesn't even make sense. Once again - real marketcap of real value, not some arbitrary fiat number.
All I am saying that the sooner fees will start to climb, the sooner we know that Bitcoin is actually succeeding. We'll need the fees to pay for security, there is no way out.

The number of miners has no impact on fees. Transactions are prioritized by the fee they are willing to pay and the space in each block is limited. If you want cheaper TXs to go through then you'll have to reject the people who paid more when composing a block, it makes no sense.
Only the TX count matters.

It will be the greatest bull market for crypto as a whole. But BTC will calm down and stop going parabolic for a good while. ALTs have lost a year's worth of their sat value in a month,  and briefly gained 20 - 40% back on the 24th-25th, when BTG shitcoin fork was done. 
Now, when people will be done speculating with Bitcoin Cash and B2X we'll see a massive bull run with BTC taking a secondary role.

Block reward halving will eventually make mining less profitable or later unprofitable. It will threaten network security. This is a real problem to be solved in the future. This is the only reason the supply increase conversation is even happening. 
If block rewards stopped being awarded today each TX would have to pay an average fee of $21 to maintain the current mining infrastructure. Transacting on on-chain has to become very expensive if Bitcoin network is to remain secured in the future.
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:13:38
It's impossible for price to keep up. In 15 more halvings one BTC would have to cost $229376000000 for miners to have equal dollar reward to what they have now. Sure, that's 60 years from now, but halving happening 10-20 years from now will be equally devastating if BTC isn't worth millions by that time. And these calculations don't account for the ever increasing investments in mining.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:40:04
Sorry, but we'll comfortably settle at 6k-7k after the fork as money flows into ALTs and Eth goes to $500, Neo to $70, etc. I am selling all of my BTC right before to triple it for the run to 20k.
If you doubt me, just go to Bitcoin dominance chart on CMC and look at what happened around the dates of the previous forks.

BTC had no use case other than buying drugs, idiotic blocksize debate and conspiring miners, no scaling, merchants dropping BTC support.
Now we've got businesses building cool stuff on top of the BTC blockchain, lightning network operational, serious ETF conversation going on, institutions beginning to take crypto seriously for the first time.
This time we actually might have an appreciation fueled by real demand and fundamentals. At 300k per coin BTC would still be worth less than gold.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:52:42


Yeah, wish that was the only effect. But before the 10th of Nov average "high" tx fee was about $2 - $3. People who paid that fee are still waiting for their money to arrive. People who paid double or triple that have had to wait about 4 days.
Fees below $2... hard to say when they'll get their money.

I think "last shreds" kinda says that.




You are being dishonest now. These people don't simply exist there, they are the majority. The post I showed is highly upvoted, every comment was in support of it and there are many more posts like it. And the Pittsburgh Synagogue shooter was a regular on that website. Like, how much proof do you need?
I am not even a leftie. I follow Sam Harris, Joe Rogan, Jordan Peterson. At least 30% of their content is dedicated to talking about excesses of the left and their overreach in censorship. 
I support free speech. I don't think gab should be shut down, but they are obviously racist, so whatever society does to them they deserve it. I'll defend the right of any company or individual not to do business with entities they do not like, for any reason, not just when that entity happens to be a white supremacist breeding ground. 


Everybody is a hero in their own mind. German citizens who supported the war also thought they were doing the right thing.
I am most upset with is the lack of critical thinking. It's obvious to everyone that something is not right with society. But rather than to really try to find out what's wrong people join cults who supposedly have the answers. It's either the racists and white men who are at fault for everything (they are not) or it's the immigrants (also wrong). You are a prime example of this - you're so entrenched in the right wing ideology that now you're having to do mental gymnastics arguing in favor of literal Nazis, as a non white person. Holy shit.

My personal view on is that LTC is either useless or is a backup Bitcoin in case BTC breaks. (It did break, temporarily, when fees got to $40.)
But there are so many other coins out there that either can do stuff that BTC can't in terms, speed, privacy, environmental impact, smart contacts. Most other coins aren't even trying to be money or stores of value, but rather are simply security or utility tokens.
