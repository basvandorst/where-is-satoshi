I used btc ATM in NYC. I used one at 225th and Broadway. In a deli right underneath the 1 train and another in another deli off of 8th ave, somewhere between 34th and 42nd, but I can't remember which street.
I found them both ATM's both convenient  and super easy, but very expensive.
I did have a hard time getting the machine to scan my wallet and most often got a paper wallet from the machine.

What were the fees?

Its a store with a subway inside. I've only noticed this happening in Boston, and its just a small counter space, I've seen it with Subways, dunkin donuts and Quiznos.

Hmmm....I've always needed ID to buy bitcoin.

And I like the satisfaction of getting help. Move on.

I've been unemployed for almost two years. I have no bank or credit. I live in a very poor area (Puerto Rico) and need something to get started with.

It depends when you bought them. If you bought them while you had a full time address in a state, then you technically have to report them, even if you move back. 
I don't know how strict they would be. I have (seemingly - passed three years) gotten away with other investment gains by moving to PR.

Guess I need a twitter account anyway! You win. I'll beg, but i wont install another non-free app. Reddit is my only guilty  pleasure in that regard.

Um. Yeah sure.

Besides fees, I think coinbase is overly suspicious and kicks people out with no explanation. Also, I've heard bad things about their customer service.
However, I recently tried to recover an old account that I did not have email access for any longer and thought I would lose out, but they actually offered really good service and I got all my coins back within a few days and minimal effort - so my one instance of using their customer service was very positive.

How is 2019's low higher then right now?

It's not begging, its more like entering a contest. I'm certainly not in a position to turn down an offer for free bitcoin.

Yeah, it was at 8000 earlier.

Not long ago I would use the ATMs in NYC. I usually used the one at 225th and Broadway. I also used one just east of 8th somewhere around 38th(can't remember exact st). Although under 15% they were definitely over 10%
