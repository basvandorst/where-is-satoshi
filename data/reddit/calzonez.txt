Thx for the clarification. Quick search shows i was referring to clarium capital.

If the # of devs also goes up by 20x, there is something wrong with the program.
It's called scaling.

No. It will become more volatile if the market cap shrinks and less useful as a currency.

I distrust people who start their sentence with "As a X."
Joking aside, time is relative (duh).
Are you building something from scratch with a competent engineering team? Sure. You can get a lot done in one year.
Are you improving/migrating a production service that already has millions of users or manages billions of dollars? One year will feel like a month (especially if you work for a large institution).

Yes i did. Lol
Sounds like you've worked for a functional organization.
Where I've worked, upper management throws millions of dollars to create more work.

Not that simple. Trust me.

You shouldn't blindly distrust them. You should look at that person's believability regarding the topic and make your own judgement independently.
Correlation and Causation.

1) lol. You wrote "That's precisely the point I'm making" where "that" is a pointer to my point. And I'm saying you misunderstood my point because otherwise you should've asked if I'm believable instead of saying you distrust me just because you've observed some correlations in the past (vs. causation).
2) Don't care. I'm not looking for an endorsement. I was irritated by someone who has no clue using buzzwords to simplify a difficult problem.
3) I meant I've built these platforms as a software engineer for large institutional investors.
Large financial platforms have so many moving parts that need to be stateful and transactional. When something is stateful, scaling is much more nuanced than throwing additional cores, ram, storage, iops, bandwidth (i.e. autoscaling).
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:14:49
No, that's not precisely the point you were making. You should've asked why you should trust me.
Some context: I've worked on financial platforms that manage billions. I know scaling is not a simple problem to solve. Trust me.
