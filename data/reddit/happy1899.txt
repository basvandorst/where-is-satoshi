Wow, didn’t realize people still knew this little about Bitcoin; I thought most understood it by now. There are several exchanges that do hundreds of millions of volume per day . And a lot of stores take bitcoin now, Overstock. Com and Microsoft are probably the biggest . Here’s a list of stores who accept it

Kraken customer service is without a doubt the worst I've ever encountered.

Damn. Imagine being the guy who just got a million dollars off 10 cents. Just wow

Will never send a cent to a company that I cant get in contact with for weeks (or months) if theres a problem. Too many other options. No excuse for piss poor customer service when you're making millions

It's amazing how they have time to write and implement this but don't have the time to process people's withdraw , deposit requests and answer emails

Does that mean the 3800 order of ETH for 10 cents stands or no?

Bitcoin skyrockets, Coinbase goes down "you're not buying from us we're holding "
 
Bitcoin plummets, Coinbase goes down "not selling your bitcoins to us during a crash"

Signed up for tiers 1-3 at kraken. After a week they approved tier 1 but the others are still processing. Why, just WHY!! You were in my account, looking at documents, why not do all of them at one time? You can't even deposit with tier 1 . What a wast of time

Deposits cash to Gdax then buy at market price. No fees for the deposit

I remember when analyst said gold was going to to 20k an ounce during the 2008 recession
