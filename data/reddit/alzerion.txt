Because you HAVE to buy their coin in order not to have coin "dust", it's basically a passive-aggressive strategy to make you buy their product, it should be a consumer choice to have the 50% fee reduction but they are finding new ways to make it a more valuable asset while not being fully transparent.

I like Binance overall, but having to buy THEIR coin to fix a problem seems like shady business practices.

 Why not? It does the job properly, of course, escrows have a lot of variables but that is something that will get automatized sooner or later. It's a matter of trust and Bitcoin or any truly decentralized cryptocurrency ensures that (of course after proper vetting of the code.)

I'm pretty sure it won't kill banks, but it does the advertised job which is the exchange of value between two parties without some third party. Why not see this in a grey area instead of black and white.

It needs a specified escrow service for cars, where the car specifications and hardware are on the blockchain and are verified (I'm not gonna peg a shill here, but there are projects doing this), the potential is there if it's going happen, I don't know, but it is possible in my opinion

A smartcontract escrow service would do the job, so you really don't need the third party, of course, I can see some services requiring at least some sort of customer service. The black and white means that people, in general, have a very polarized opinion, there isn't much middle ground, so Bitcoin is either crap or the holy grail.

Isn't an ETF rejection actually a good thing? Why are people so concerned about it, an ETF goes against what Bitcoin is about. Are people that short-sighted? Can't they see the long-term potential of being independent of financial institutions?
