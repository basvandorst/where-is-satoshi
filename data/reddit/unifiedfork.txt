So if you were going to list problems with paying workers in bitcoins instead of USD, would this make the list?

A person who led a club i know of tried doing this a couple months ago. The club is in the process of selling their parts back because of how unprofitable the market is.

Failure of a brand right there... Such a shame.

This article is a piece of crap. Don't read it unless you want to see how a the old, ignorant, and unacquainted with technology (congress?) see bitcoin.
•They're hard to trace and risky
•most people spending them up to no good
•bitcoins aren't physical coins, pieces of computer code that exist in cyberspace
•no consumer protections, money's value could just disappear
Seriously. Wtf.

Banks protect your cash? Wow, shocking. A bitcoin wallet requires a password to it, AND i don't have banks playing with my money, so there's nothing I need protecting from, except scammers and theft, which aren't unique to bitcoin . Anything you buy in cash and get a return on, I could also do the same for bitcoin.
Oh, and you get a wage slip, but the government doesn't know the serial number for every dollar you get paid with. With bitcoin they essentially do, unless you run it through a tumbler. And at that point, your money can still be easily traced back to you (or be probably enough for a warrant), much UNLIKE cash, but less of a problem than credit cards in your name. 
These problems aren't unique to bitcoin, and the only worth in this article is that they acknowledge it's a more volatile currency.

Why on earth would banks want to use bitcoin? PUBLIC. TRANSACTIONS. Are a huge nono for those guys.

There *are* negatives, but the negatives they bring up are silly. For example, claiming most of the people using bitcoin are "up to no good." The wording of the article is for people new to the topic, but their dumbing down just isn't at a good quality level.
Edit: forgot a word

Disallowing use of BTC where cash is already not allowed isn't much of a ban.

Hard to trace? Easier than cash.
No consumer protections? Better than cash.
And the list goes on...
My point isn't that the article is bringing up invalid points, but is making these common problems appear to be unique to bitcoin.
