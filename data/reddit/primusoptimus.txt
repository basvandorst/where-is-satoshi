Atleast monero has clearly something that Bitcoin will not get with lightning and what is not easily replicated: privacy and fungibility.
Also, as privacy is not an additional feature you can easily ”turn on” but more of a fundamental design issue, I think monero community has a significant headstart on that front which might last (or not).

Yes, i still believe people have gotten more screwed by themselves vs. 3rd party holder after mt. Gox. 3rd parties are getting more reliable/safe vs. user errors persist and personal user security is not significantly better. Of course no way to prove one way or the other, since user held losses do not get recorded.
But the real argument worth arguing is if it is at this moment more safe for average person to hold coins themselves vs. with a credible 3rd party. Same type of discussion as holding your fiat cash at home vs. bank account. Taking the ”power/responsibility” may not make sense unless you have the capability to handle it.

Nobody knows the exact amount, but it estimated that about about 20-30% of total Bitcoin in circulation is lost for ever due to user/system errors.
Obviously exchanges cause risks, but it is dumb to think that handling crypto yourself would be riskfree. I’m arguing that for average person the risk is higher in handling things for yourself (I’m talking about average person, not average crypto owner)

I would bet that after Mt. Gox scam people have lost more coins managing the coins themselves vs. due to exchange scams/errors.
I personally would trust credible exchanges more vs. average person to manage small amounts of crypto. Losing your seedwords and your desktop will mean losing your coins and I bet that happens a lot, people just do not make a big fuzz about their own mistakes.

Eg. One of the most credible blockchain analysis company Chainalysis:

Agreed, there is no definitive method to find out how big % of coins are lost by individuals or how common it is today. 
But it happens. Just google ”I lost my bitcoin” to get a glimpse.
