I think your understanding of BTC might be limited. 
Once you send btc to an account there is no take backs, doesn't matter who has the original master-seed a new private key is generated. I keep seeing people say this about Coinbase and it just shows how limited their understanding is.
With that being said don't leave funds on Coinbase, don't leave Coins on Coinbase, they are an exchange not a secure noncustodial wallet. If you want custody of keys send to your local wallet.

Right, but you can send the coins to another wallet and you can has all the keys you want.
Robbinhood is the real outlier here... You can't send those coins anywhere.

Seems like you just have to fill the machines wallet with btc first is what people in the comments are failing to understand. There's no such thing as a free lunch here
