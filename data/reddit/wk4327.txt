there is no way to say how many merchants are on xt, because they don't generate any blocks. It is only possible to say how many miners, because they can generate blocks in a certain way, and counting how many blocks are generated with xt signature can be a signal that most miners are on xt. Obviously, once the first &gt;1MB block gets  generated, there will be a fork in the chain, which happens, but normally these blocks get reconciled. Once, due to a bug, there has been a pretty major fork, which took a pretty long time to reconcile, but it eventually did reconcile. In this case, however, there will be no reconciliation if two incompatible versions of bitcoin are running. There _could_ possibly be a scenario, where bitcoin core miners will take over bitcoin-xt miners and reset the fork in their favor, but that would mean that xt never had majority of miners to begin with. 
Whatever he meant by what he said, if he REALLY talks about switching to the new blocksize without getting majority miners onboard, he is delusional. Without majority miners on his side, xt just becomes a new altcoin. I definitely am not following his chain in that case. I just don't think that's what he truly meant.

During that large fork, I think the "new" version went ahead like 20 blocks or so, and it took very-very long to catch up. But the reason it caught up is because fork was caused by a bug, and even though it was not a bug in "new" client, it was still a hard fork, which is something to avoid. However, it ultimately was up to miners, whether to accept that the blocks they mined should go void and they have to return to the old chain, or to keep mining with a new client and get merchants update their software. It could have been either way. At a certain point, majority of them decided to play it safe and fallback to the old protocol. But if majority didn't, merchants would have had to bite the bullet and update. Developers did play a role in this, as they explained what went wrong and what are the options, but at no point they were playing dictator. Decision is always made by miners.

This is bullshit. If there is enough transactions to fill 20MB block, then at 8MB limit, the miners will just have to mine 3 blocks one after another, totalling 20MB. Miners will be downloading 20MB anyway. Same amount, same problem. If their internet is so lacking, then they will not be capable of supporting network in future anyway, that's just a reality. Putting low limit on block size is not going to help. Buying cheap miners is not enough, gotta also upgrade bandwidth. That's the cost of doing business.

Miners are the ones who solely run the network. They are the ones who are affected by block size directly. People who use bitcoin could care less about block size, hard fork, or other underpinnings. Miners are the ones who can make or reject that change, and someone better have an effort underway to make sure they are on board

i think they are ripping out the words out of context. He said "we would ignore the longest chain. It doesn’t matter if it’s the longest chain... eee.. let me rephrase that". The guy is on the show. You can't always think fast enough while you are on the show to properly phrase yourself. I don't think he is looking to deliberately insert long blocks to break the blockchain for those who keep running the "classic" bitcoin nodes. If you listen to this show, it starts with getting like majority of nodes on bitcoin-xt first, and only then starting an 20mb block generation. There is no need at this time to force remaining nodes on that chain anymore, because they will have minority hashing power. The "checkpoint" blocks would just happen naturally. I don't think it is possible to have code that "forces" these checkpoints, it would be major hack.
also... I don't have a proof, but it looks to me that the article is getting updated as we discuss. I clearly remember the article that i read was calling Hearn something like "self-proclaimed lead bitcoin developer", now it correctly saus that he's not a lead bitcoin developer, but developer of bitcoin-xt.

@_date: 2014-06-13 21:22:35
all I'm saying is that mathematically it is a wash. You get less stable income at smaller pool, but that is offset with bigger rewards when a lucky block is mined. Overall, there's same chance of getting more BTC as it is to get less. Unless there's something else at play I cannot see benefit of using big pool, other than making income more stable.

I understand... I imagined, mining business is risky one to begin with, so a little extra fluctuation is just part of business, then it doesn't matter what size of pool it is. But if indeed most miners are at risk of losing their life savings, and that's what makes them cling to ghash, then I guess we are in a bubble, and we'll see it pop soon.

I have to admit I never used breadwallet, and I probably would not, because of my "no apple" rule. With that said: if you are concerned with security, and you have substantial amount of BTC to secure, your best options are: a) multisig, b) paper wallet. Both solutions would require you to become an expert, which means spending a lot of time to learn in detail how they work, but it's the only way to be certain that your funds are safe.
If you don't store much, and use BTC for small spending, then anything will be OK, blockchain.info included.

It is not clear from your question what is exactly that you are looking for, and this is why you are getting the inconsistent answers.
My impression is that you are asking how does it happen that protocols are followed, where is the embodiment of these protocols? If this is what you are looking for, then the  's answer seems to be closest to the truth, except the 20+ GB data he mentions have no importance to protocol per se. The protocol is implemented in "bitcoin core" code, which is compiled into either `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt` programs. These programs are solely responsible for protocol integrity. Here's how it works: lets imagine a block is submitted to a network by one of alternative clients, which due to a bug or improper implementation of protocol is not valid. Since most of network is made of bitcoin core clients, most of network will reject the non-conforming block, and it will be thrown away. If there is a bug in bitcoin core, which violates something in a protocol, then that bug becomes a de-facto feature of protocol, because network will accept blocks having that bug due to the fact that most nodes will.
TL;DR: code of reference bitcoin client is there the protocol is stored

If you are a grandpa and the only thing you do is shop at overstock.com, there is likely an app for you. Even then it is likely to fuck up and get you overcharged or under-charged with all consequences.
without going into too much of details:
1. People move funds in between wallets for various reasons, one of which is security. People move funds to cold wallets and out. You cannot make an app which is aware of all the addresses you control.
2. People [will] move bitcoin to multisig wallets - those which they may or may not control. No wallet would be able to say if you still control these funds, because you may or may not.
3. People get their funds stolen, e.g.: transferred without their knowledge by malware. How is your hypothetical app distinguished between that and an actual purchase?
4. People mine altcoins. Even right now you have pools with 20+ different altcoins to mine all at the same time. They have flurry of transactions each worth pennies. There is no wallet available which tracks transfers, swaps, and current prices of so many altcoins.
5. Even if such wallet was possible (handling all bitcoins + all altcoins + tracking their prices + automatically determining which transfers are taxable events and which are not), what about new altcoins popping up every day? Are you saying "just don't mine the new altcoins and you're fine"?
Bottom line is: IRS demonstrated clear as a day that they are incapable of collecting tax from individuals without creating major burden - not financial - but paperwork. That was long the situation, but now it became obvious how in-comprehensively idiotic tax law is. We are not employees for IRS - we have no obligation to do their paperwork, or find solutions for them because they are so fucked up. It went too far. It is not a time to write software to fix the bitcoin, because bitcoin is fine. It is time to abolish tax system altogether. This system amounts to involuntary servitude and should go.

I am not saying the corrupt judicial system made by lawyers and for lawyers will not be encouraging you to read every line of every paper they stick in your face and then accept responsibility for failing to read every letter of it.
Here's the issue I wanted to point out: the big companies are not negotiating terms when they have you sign the contract (read: agree to terms). There is not a negotiation. They will hire someone to write 10 pages of junk, and hope most folks won't read.
If too many people will actually figure out how to read all of it, they will make this 100 pages. If too many people will read 100 pages, they will make it 1000 pages. They will make it bigger than library of congress if they must. It only takes coinbase 100 man-hours to write that contract. If you calculate how many man-hours it takes the customers to read it, you will see what huge disbalance it is. "Agreements" are not there to make you understand what you can and can not do, they are there to make it so that they always have the upper hand. Everybody knows: nobody reads them. Why do we keep acting like anyone does.
In common law, [contract]( has an essential element, called [meeting of minds]( "common understanding in the formation of the contract". Saying that I clicked on "i agree" button means that I had meeting of the mind with coinbase lawyer who wrote a contract is ridiculous. What was on my mind is "i am looking for an exchange that won't screw me over". What the marketing materials of coinbase say is "we are reliable exchange which doesn't screw over people". What that "agreement" says is: "we are looking for any excuse to screw you over". I am arguing that "agreement" is null and void. Nobody reads it, and nobody cares about it. Coinbase gave you an offer to be your exchange, you accepted it. If they don't want to deal with you, go ahead, close account, and refund. Don't just hold on to another person's property and act like nothing happens
TL;DR: even if coinbase never broke any written agreement, they are assholes in my book of values

I don't believe you know what you talking about. Keys could be generated in a trustless manner by just about anything. In fact this is the ONLY way to generate keys. Only benefit of bitcoin-qt is having local copy of blockchain. Since he indicated he was keeping his BTC on exchange, holding on to blockchain clearly not on his priority list
While I appreciate sentiment that we need more people running core, advising it to somebody who wants to just get off online exchange is a terrible advice. Running it consumes significant CPU power, generates huge network traffic and takes pretty significant amount of disk space. It is a burden.
He is not running mining operation. He is not running business. He does not need to install something that takes a week just for initial replication. While we all have our agendas, lets not give him a bad advice, the one that would end up leading him straight back to using online exchange as his wallet.

I don't understand why is variance so detrimental here? Mathematically, what you lose in not getting block found, you gain in getting a chance of getting bigger reward.

correct, but if you are lucky and get block anyway, then your reward will by far exceed your investment. It's like playing lottery when odds are slightly in your favor. I'm not arguing that this is a viable business strategy, all I'm saying is that risk/reward ratio is not affected here, if anything it's better for solo mining since you have no overhead. 
At any rate, I do not see how participating in smaller pool would significantly affect business. Will you get smaller rewards on regular basis? Yes. But in exchange you get bigger rewards when your pool gets lucky, so in the end you get the same profits.

i think specifically this is likely to be a problem with big pool vs small pool. You don't need a 50% attack to gain unfair advantage. All you need to do when you have big %% of miners is delay accepting block for 15 seconds - this will give you a 2.5% better chance that one of your own miners will find a block. Such delay would likely be unnoticed, and a little better profit would also come as statistical variance.

The reason gold grew so much lately is not because it suddenly became rare and expensive, but because money became cheap. Good old inflation. Gold on the other hand simply stayed as-is. But because technology improved significantly, you can now get much more for much less, so it looks like gold suddenly became expensive, when all it did is retain value. This really is all you want if you are looking for a retirement fund: get something that will retain value. Gold being not very heavy and easy to hide from confiscation is an obvious choice. 
Bitcoin is a good way to store value too. And I agree that it has a much better utility. This is why I said "better have both". Just don't become too focused on only one investment. Putting all your eggs in one basket is a sure way to bankruptcy, because you lose flexibility and when times are tough, you will be forced to sell low buy high.
Also: while what I described technically might be "doomsday scenarios", usually people use this expression to refer to something out of science fiction, not a very real possibility. It feels to me you dismiss the chance of disturbance too easy. War in your neighborhood could easily happen. People die in big numbers all around the globe - right now, you just don't see dead bodies on TV. Turn off water, gas and power to a big city and see what will happen.

I guess this thread became a circlejerk already, so I'm kinda late to party, but how about this: many gold bugs do what they do for survival rather than to become insanely rich someday.
A single nuke detonated in high atmosphere could wipe most of electronic devices, internet infrastructure, and power grid; and there goes bitcoin, at least for awhile. When (if) the grid gets restored, most of bitcoin holdings will be lost, because despite being warned, I bet most folks here never done paper wallet backup cuz they "hold it on their computers", and it doesn't occur to them that hard drives could all demagnetize at once. Same thing applies to a solar flare going off in the wrong direction at the wrong time. Gold will not be affected by that. There will certainly be stuff more precious than gold if that event happens, but gold will actually keep at least some value.
Those of you who think that event will not happen - look at Ukraine. Two major superpowers having thousands of very dangerous weapons, are at each other throats. Both superpowers are ruled by people with no concept of responsibility for what they do, and a place to hide in case things go south. You will be surprised how fast things could deteriorate.
I guess what I'm trying to say is: don't be laughing at gold bugs. You don't know what will happen. Better have both

if you consider that you could be lucky, then risk/reward stays the same, because lucky find will pay more on smaller pool.

For many of us, the problem of running full node is not tied to the CPU/RAM/Disk IO, although it takes a plenty of these. The bigger problem, at least for USA at-home setup is the ISP and Internet traffic. Usual setup here is cable, and it's normally capped at somewhere around 200-400 GB/month. I am not running full node for more than a year, but even back in days, it was adding a substantial chink of traffic to the monthly allowance. It is my understanding that currently bitcoin node can easily eat through 100GB in a month, and potentially a lot more. Unfortunately, this problem is a tough one to solve, since american ISPs are on crusade against torrents, and the only way they can reliably hit these is with data caps.

I think what's being missed here is wording. "Legal currency" is a lawyer lingo, stands for currency recognized by legal system. "Not a legal currency" is not the same as "illegal currency", doesn't mean you are breaking any law.
The good analogy here is if you drank too much you are "legally intoxicated". That means that from the point of legal system you are intoxicated. But if you only had two beers, and can still drive, that does not mean you are "illegally intoxicated". So, same thing about currency - "not legal currency" means government doesn't recognize you as currency, that doesn't mean "illegal currency"
EDIT: Another analogy is - turkeys. They are birds. They are under no stretch of imagination "legal currency". Following logic of that zdnet asshole, that makes them "illegal currency", so the turkeys should be banned.
Notice, how "Senator Tom Coburn agrees that Bitcoin is not legal currency" - that's because senator very well knows what that means. Not being legal currency doesn't mean anything criminal

1. Average block is found in 10 mins, ghash must have 100% hashrate in order to reliably find blocks in 5-15 mins
2. When smaller pool finds block, the reward is higher than in bigger pool. So, if smaller pool has 10 times less hash power, it is 10 times less likely to find block, but reward for block is 10 times higher per hash. Maybe you won't find block. But if you will, you will be rewarded disproportionally high. It evens out. If you mine using reasonbly sized pool, there should be no reason to worry about ROI.

questions you need to ask yourself is: 
a) Are you going to use them or hold on to them?
b) Do you consider what you got a large amount?
In case you are going to use some of them, and hold on to the rest, you could use following approach:
1. Print yourself 10-20 paper wallets. Possibly laminate them if you can. Make sure you are using OFFLINE computer booted from CD-ROM, and make sure you do not print them on network connected printer. Also, make sure you are not using one of those big ass office class printers with hard drives, which save an image of every page they print.
2. Install an easy to use wallet, like mycelium, multibit, or electrum. Avoid bitcoin-qt or armory for that purpose.
3. Determine, how much BTC are you comfortable carrying on computer or mobile.
4. Move all funds to your electronic wallet at once
5. Spread funds over your paper wallets, putting amount that you determined at step 3 on 50% of your paper wallets, and spreading the rest on remaining paper wallets. Make a note on each one, how much it's supposed to hold.
6. Every time you spent away funds from your electronic wallet and need to fill it, open up paper wallet and scan private key. Every time you have too much on your "hot" wallet, offload funds to paper wallet.
if you printed more paper wallets than you use, you could use them as "give money to friend" wallet. Carry them with you, and when you need to give your buddy $5 for beer bill he paid, you can just transfer BTC from mobile phone into empty wallet and give him/her. It's very useful for that purposes. I find it that many of my friends are interested in bitcoin, but it's too burdensome to go seeking for a seller. Carrying a couple blank paper wallets you can quickly transfer BTC to and give away comes very handy, and gives more people opportunity to start with bitcoin

Self-interest will win in the end, it always does. If that means end of bitcoin - that does make me sad, but be what will be. It however is a shame that it's likely a perceived self-interest what caused the issue, not a real one, because any semi-big pool would have provided the same level of income as long as it's an honest one. But if there is a flawed incentive structure in bitcoin, it's likely going to get worse. So brace yourself for a rocky travel

You know here - the only way to win is not to play. Trying to outlobby mastercard is exactly the same sort of proposition. They are infinitely better in lobbying than anybody, they have all the people on key positions, all the power and all the money necessary to bribe their way and more.
There is no beating them, screwing up people is what they do for living, they will never stop.
People who created bitcoin knew that is going to happen. This is why they built resiliency features into the system, making it very hard for any government to interfere. Using these features, and building upon them is our only chance. If they work, no lobby can harm bitcoin. If they don't, no amount of lobbying will help - bitcoin will end subverted.

While being supporter of open source, there's definitely systemic problems with it. Here's an example for you: I wrote an open source app ~5 years ago, planning to get by with donations. The reason I remember, is that I paid upfront for 5 years of hosting to make it cheaper. You know how much money I got in donations? About $5 worth. And I not only spent many $$$ for hosting, but also countless hours. This thing is not going to write itself, not going to support itself, read/reply to comments, fix bugs, talk to hosting assholes when they suspend your account for no reason, deal with all the goddam moving pieces. It's annoying and not very rewarding job, literally $5-worth rewarding. The application site has 5-10K hits per day, so it's not useless, a lot of people use it, just nobody wants to chip in.
To put this in perspective: I'm being paid a little shy of 100 bucks per hour to write software which tracks what people do, trap them, catch them, and reports them to governmental/corporate management. And I don't even have to work too hard. I am well aware that it is evil, but I am also well aware that writing software that gives people freedom will leave you broke. And I have family to feed.
If 10% of people using fruits of my labor chipped in one lunch worth of money I wouldn't be ranting here like that.
Until the community at large realizes that some people who write software which makes the world tick could use some  contribution, the free software model will not be successful. There's many idealists and altruists writing great software, but their patience is not endless. I myself am not a Trezor user, but I wouldn't be surprised if one day they say: fuck it all, we worked our ass off, and all the hours we invested got taken by freeloaders, so we're gone, surveillance state pays much better.
I hope you, other folks in here will rethink how they treat software freedom before that happens.

I had similar sentiment, however the problem here is that the private key must be concealed before transaction, and revealed after.

Another issue is that vouchers usually have two qr-codes, one for public, one for private key. There is no telling for merchant if what you gave him is valid just by looking at public key, because private key qr-code could be just garbage. At the same time you can not allow merchant to scan private key to validate it, because that would mean that merchant can queerly swipe the whole balance and there is no way to prove that he did.

Jeezus fucking Christ, this is advice that people repeat over and over and over. Don't use exchange as your wallet. Like gox lesson was not enough. How could anyone in this day and age not follow it I have no clue.

If increasing block size is all that is required to boot the luke-jr out of bitcoin business forever, I'm all for it

unfortunately, even though this piece is so obviously manipulative and it's apparent that arguments are made up, it works.

what happened, why out of sudden ltc being dumped?

This is what they call false dichotomy

I guess I missed the pump part, although it did register in my mind a few days ago that LTC out of sudden was too expensive for no reason that I know of

I am not sure that the fees themselves are such a scam. What is likely a scam is the folks ordering stuff for the others at unrealistically high discount. 
I am aware of the people outside USA, who have hard time cashing their amazon credit they legitimately earned via ads. These could be some of the purse.io clients who do the ordering. But I have hard time believing nobody there is just some sort of hacker, who stole someone else's credit card and now using purse.io as a cash out tool.
My problem is that I don't see how can I filter these out. If you happen to come across one of these frauds, you essentially will look like a mule to the cops, and if you use that site quite often, you will be seen as a repeat mule. In other words, I see a potential risk here

What I'm noticing is that the guy (Molyneux) has no problem skirting his own teachings. A few years ago, I remember him and his minions vehemently defending that the groups don't exist. Now apparently there are "old people" and "young people". Not only for rhetorical purpose: one of these groups has to actually be held responsible.

... and they killed Aaron Schwartz
@_date: 2015-04-08 14:42:07
software engineer here
implementing high level algorithms in hardware is pretty hardcore, one reason being that it's impossible to deliver any updates or bug fixes. With that said, I see little or no benefit of "bugging" generic purpose CPU chip, such as i5:
- "biased" RNG is overcome with little to no effort. Systems such as Linux already do get entropy from more than one source, so an effect of bugged RNG is really none. Obviously, I'm not talking Windows here.
- "call home" feature could be implemented with external 3G modem, yes. It is highly unlikely that such modem could be fully integrated into a CPU chip, since it requires access to antenna, and due to physical characteristics building physical antenna into a chip is unlikely. And not detecting antenna is even less likely.
Since the Intel chips are general purpose, the stuff running on it is, well - general purpose. There really isn't a single way to even tell what's IP address of machine is. I am really struggling to imagine what exactly could one do if he was tasked with "bugging" intel CPU chip. I'm not saying it can't be done, just not sure what could be the practical exploit.

Software engineer here. I don't wanna shit on anyone's parade, but when I hear "our software is fastest in the world" i tend to call bs on that statement. No seasoned developer would ever make that claim. No software could be "best" or "fastest" unconditionally. There are always parameters under which it is performing good or bad
@_date: 2015-04-11 01:09:13
Is that the same MIT, which participated in killing Aaron Schwartz?
@_date: 2015-04-13 00:13:56
Like they helped Aaron Schwartz
@_date: 2015-04-12 23:02:03
May be so, but I find it hard to trust them to be "neutral place" after that
@_date: 2015-04-19 07:06:43
For short term crash, have a credible security company announce they found a critical weakness in the crypto supporting BTC
Another method is buy 50+ percent of hashing power and keep producing empty blocks, which will kill transactions, or slow them down
@_date: 2015-03-29 05:44:59
Except when they lobby
@_date: 2015-03-29 18:47:40
Who cares if it's a million? If funds are double spent they can cut off service at any time. There is no risk. Why keep people waiting at all?
@_date: 2015-03-19 05:05:21
Why do I not hear that that "this is actually a good news" in this thread?
@_date: 2015-03-29 15:38:44
It took me awhile for deposit land in account, and I was even wondering for awhile if funds were lost in transit. There was a moment when I thought I should have paid with credit card instead. Which is bs, because who waits for 6 confirmations when you are getting paid for service which you are to provide in future and can stop at any moment, should the funds go missing
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:14:36
To be fair, luke-jr is the guy I wouldn't be missing
@_date: 2015-03-29 21:13:16


That was my expectation as well, except it took awhile for the funds to show up. I basically wasted about an hour in the middle of pretty sensitive domain transfer operation, which you can't just put aside. I really wished at that time that I shouldn't have screwed around and just paid with CC. That happened last December, so it was not long ago. All was as usual as far as I could tell.
@_date: 2015-03-21 03:20:04
I don't think this has server backbend code,it looks like front end only
@_date: 2015-03-20 18:51:31


so that means it's on the internet, which in turn means that "Bios pass" and "hdd encrypt" security measures are already bypassed for attacker
@_date: 2015-03-20 06:09:09
Russian speaker here. Title is misleading. This article does NOT say that Ukraine blocks accounts of arbitrary bitcoin users. It says that they are freezing accounts of separatists, not everybody. It also says that they are closing their bitcoin (edit:typo) accounts, which is obviously absurd
@_date: 2015-03-22 21:07:54
Lol, that's a real funny clip
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:06:21
I don't know why are we discussing this. Woulda, coulda, shoulda. All I am trying to say is that experience with namecheap and paying in BTC is not always smooth, despite what op says. I am not advocating that anyone should prefer one form of payment or another.
@_date: 2015-03-21 16:28:50
sadly, they don't. For very many of them Putin is sweetheart.
@_date: 2015-03-29 18:45:56
Good for you. I am just talking about my experience, and I wasted like an hour starting at screen waiting for funds to appear, wondering if I should pay with cc again
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:27:14
I urge you, put your money where your mouth is: boot luke-jr from maintainers. It is not the first time he secretly implements this sort of changes. It is clearly not an honest mistake, he intentionally breaks the package. There should be zero tolerance for such actions.

you forgot to add "+pray" component :)

- if laptop is connecting to internet, it could become a target for malware.
- you mentioned encrypted backup - how do you back it up, who stores the data, and where's decryption key stored?

That might be true, but specific article in question says nothing about it

SegWit, as a protocol, is broken and simply not Bitcoin; as a piece of software, is a piece of junk; as a potential coin, is deemed as an altcoin by most exchanges.

if I own share in foreign company, it does not mean that company suddenly becomes subject to USA law. Because that would also mean that every USA company is subject to law of every other country, since any foreign national can own them.
Having FinCEN registration does not mean anything for exactly the same reason. FinCEN regulations work wherever FinCEN has jurisdiction, and for that reason only they register with FinCEN. Otherwise these regulations are non-applicable. If they were, then Cryptsy would have to follow law of every ass backwards country they are possibly doing business in.

If they don't fork, they are likely to get their credibility back, and it is not trivial to organize a hard fork. So it's likely, the fork will not happen, no matter how much they debate

According to what I read, Cryptsy is not US company, and the guy is Ukrainian, so not US person either
