This is the tragic part.  They actually have a good product which is finally shipping.  And every other aspect of their business conspires to obscure this fact.  That said, I started my refund process and will never do pre-order business with them again.  I would advise anyone to never do pre-order business with them again.

As a musician, the attitudes in this thread depress me.

That is a common misunderstanding, due to the fact that many teams use git with a centralized workflow. But even in that case [git's distributed nature]( will prove useful for disaster recovery, if nothing else.

Put $5 down to pre-order a game before its release date to ensure that you get priority shipping in the case of limited quantity upon release.  There are usually other benefits to customers in terms of in-game content or physical content not initially available to non-pre-order customers.  The main benefit to the game publisher is to gauge market demand to tune production quantities and finalize release date.
But since the up front cost is only $5, customers lose very little when there are production delays.
This method of customer-wrangling would only have worked for BFL if they had enough cash to cover initial production costs.  Instead they had to take full-price pre-orders from early backers, and failed to treat those early backers with respect.

Enjoying the track!  How long did the CoinDL approval process take?

I expected it to print a sealed paper wallet.  I'll guess that the QR code is not the private key but a URL for blockchain.info for the transaction.  The public key is displayed on the screen, so I'll assume the user fed that in somehow already (probably via the phone on table).
I'd love to have something that convenient nearby.
--edit--  Here's their website: [Lamassu Bitcoin Ventures](

The guy who seemed to be doing the most thorough blockchain research has apparently deleted his account.  I recall him saying he'd followed all of the money and couldn't figure out how they were able to pay out more than they took in.  He was convinced early on it was a scam, and started his research way before they split.
[This thread]( is a good example of all of the holes left by his deleted account.

I have slowly accepted the "freemium" nature of music consumption today, but I'm not happy about it.  For me it's still strange to see such unashamed "of course I would never pay money for music!" as if paying for someone's creative work is absurd.  I spend actual money for music, video games, movies, e-books, software, etc.  It's a generational thing I guess.
Also: I produce music, not t-shirts or posters or beer cozies.
P.S. Thanks for the tip!

I feel for BFL.  They worked very hard to finally produce a decent product they can be proud of, but it doesn't matter in the end since nearly every other aspect of their business is a complete failure.
They could have used the GameStop method of some small percentage down to secure your location in the queue.
And if they didn't have enough cash on hand for product development (they didn't), they could have used the Kickstarter method of mega-transparency and constant communication with early backers.  Each of the pre-order customers are effectively early backers, and are rightfully annoyed with BFL's lack of appreciation.
It's a bummer they instead chose to treat their customers like their enemies.

Is it actually known that MultiBit regularly corrupts wallet files?  Got any links for that?
