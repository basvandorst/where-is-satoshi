Lol srs is my favorite sub is like a well spring of non stop tears
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:52:13
that is very odd 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:36:29
it's the same company :) use 2 factor authentication
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:30:53
yes it's incredibly easy, it's the same company :) just use your coinbase login to gdax website and you can instantly transfer funds and coins
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:54:51
nope, they don't do that
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:47:32
gdax is 0% for maker
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:47:44
of course, i love coinbase but it's silly once you learn
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:04:28
I agree for sure. The only thing you're incorrect about is that GDAX has a buy/sell function that will instantly buy/sell, which is pretty nice
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:38:28
I guess nobody can prevent you from surrendering willingly

France is fucked
@_date: 2017-05-08 20:36:43
Yeah, it's pretty nuts how much I've wasted in fees unnecessarily. I mean, it's not *that* much but it's completely unnecessary, not to mention the ~1% premium off spot price that coinbase seems to take
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:16:14
it's progressing just about exactly as estimated... You do see the demographic changes happening, right? Do you think the migrants will become more french, or france will become more like the migrants?
@_date: 2017-05-08 20:35:43
Nope, you can withdraw and deposit straight from GDAX. It seems like coinbase is strictly there for user friendliness, i.e. people who don't know what they're doing, like me? GDAX seems superior in every single way
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:55:16
I think you'll find that when france is 70% african and middle eastern, the evil will not be lesser indeed
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:42:18
I thought you would be against stereotyping?
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:36:55
...there's more things in life than bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:47:06
I'm not against it, I just thought you would be. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:28:54
what a G
@_date: 2015-11-30 08:39:43
Damn that's so deep 
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:34:07
That's quite true, but GDAX has the same wallet functions as coinbase, and has a simple buy/sell function for the non trade savvy as well. 
I mean I definitely understand coinbase looks more user friendly (why I used it) but damn such a big difference with just a tiny tiny bit of looking into it.
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:10:40
let me guess, you're a cuck fetishist too
@_date: 2017-05-08 20:13:23
Nah, I just don't have a blindfold wrapped tightly around my eyes like you do. France is dying, as is every european country. You may think that France will be the same when it is no longer culturally French, and you can keep on thinking that until reality hits you in the face. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:19:04
same for cash transfers i believe
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:59:26
So, better than you.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:24:11
just moves them straight over :) 
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:06:28
good luck!
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:19:19
at elast you can stop now :p
