What about banks? What power do banks have to stop it? They will obviously resist it as it is in direct competition with the staple of banking - their service is being made more and more redundant with bitcoin adoption. Also what about tax? Will govts be able to easily tax bitcoin profits through software (i think so)? Or will they fight it cos they cant tax it?

Oh yeah I have had american travellers come in saying we put US banks to shame, I was actually surprised because usually US services put ours to shame

The root of the issue in his argument is how he says gold has value - without explaining why it has value. The value of gold is that it is rare and durable, not because it "is gold". If Grass was rare and durable and Gold grew out of the ground no one would give a fcuk about Gold, we would have backed the dollar on Grass. So without realising it, (by stating something is because it is) the argument he used for Gold applies 100% in the same way for Bitcoin. The only benefit Gold has over Bitcoin is that it can be used in jewelry as well, but an unrelated side benefit is not sufficient reason to chose it for the intended purpose over something that does the job better (bitcoin)

Doing cash jobs to avoid tax is illegal, and harder to hide/use than bitcoin but that still happens :)

That doesn't mean they will split them, it just means that customers can deposit/withdraw/trade on both chains - ie they aren't going to boycott one or the other by only listing one.
So we still don't have a definitive answer to this question. Just a bit weird that such an obvious question hasn't been answered anywhere yet &gt;_&lt;

approx USD in circ = 1,300,000,000,000
USD users (USA Pop.) = 323,000,000
BTC in circ = 16,500,000
BTC users = 16,000,000 (according to blockchain.info)
323/16 = approx 20% of USD users are BTC users
Means 20% of USD in circ should = actual BTC total value (260,000,000,000). This total / 16,500,000 = $15,757 actual value per Bitcoin
Really shady math I know but would you guys agree we could determine an *actual* value like this - based off bitcoins inherent value being in its currency values + user count?
