Worth it if you bought it when bitcoin was at 3k

When we switch to segwit is that going to create another chain like bcash or is it still going to be the same chain &amp; just allow larger transactions? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:17:32
Ahh okay. So my transaction will go into a non-segwit block?

So if I'm using blockchain.info for my wallet and they don't upgrade their client are my coins just stuck?

Invest a little bit when you got the money and it all adds up man. Most of us don't just buy 1 BTC at a time.

Yeah and if could be more useful than for just bitcoin. Just sends an email when I'm dead lol

I tried looking for where i got it on ebay but i guess the seller doesnt have it any longer. Just google ways to turn your 220v dryer outlet into a PDU. Or you can hire an electrician and he can wire one up for you. 
The mining business isnt cheap. Ive put in over 5k just with my small mining set up.

Do you forsure have your PSU plugged into a 220V outlet?
If you plug it into a 110V outlet the PSU may seem like its working, the fan spinning and maybe some lights on but it MUST be plugged into 220V.

No problem

You can't just convert a 110v outlet to 220v. But what I've done is get a Specially made PDU that plugs into my Dryer outlet and it converts it to 4 220v outlets that I have running 1 S9 and 3 S7s.
