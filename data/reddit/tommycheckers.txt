Same here. Haven't had any issues with them

There should be a separate category for sites that let you purchase BTC with USD
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:31:31
What others do you recommend? The verification process is what turns me down
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:51:00
Coinbase is the most basic site. Very easy to use.

I've got the S8 with sync pro and I see the box with an x. I think Android O fixes this.

My favorite is using a degausser then smashing with hammer. Much fun
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:38:03
Actually checked to see if this was real

Bitcoin addiction costs more than a crack addiction. The difference is you make money. Pro tip sell crack and buy Bitcoin with the profits

Kidneys are worth about 20k
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:13:16
Lol right. I bought in at 6k. I've still made a ton of money even if BTC sits at 14k forever
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:39:05
Damn all those down votes for a joke? Tough crowd

Remind me to change the combination to my luggage

I mine with a 1060 and I make about 2.70-3.00 a day. But thats just on an extra laptop not an actual mining rig.

I was explaining BTC to my grandpa (very smart man) over holiday and he called it a ponzie scheme haha. I thought it was funny at how interested he was and all the research he had done over the week I was with him. He ended up buying some in the end.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:06:48
Joke or is this serious speculation?
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:08:01
could this play any role in why BTC is dropping?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:27:37
Seriously doubt it
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:19:30
You could try a site that sells other coins that dont require verification and trade for btc? not sure how logical this is but just an idea
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:09:24
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:56:44
Saw the same thing haha
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:43:04
Buy now and buy again if it does dip
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:52:29
Lol I just opened the coinbase app and saw it was inop
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:23:48
Thanks that explains it perfectly. I've been reading articles on it but I'm getting 500 different views of it. I think It's weird that coinbase is replacing everyones btc with s2x, not sure how i feel about that. Thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:44:49
I'm in the same boat. Not sure if I should move my money around or what
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:58:58
No? I just got back from deployment and all the different articles I'm reading say different things. I'd like to know whats actually happening from the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:33:42
So you're just saying Pepe Silvia over and over and shes getting it right?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:49:45
Ah shit I'm not ready
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:27:28
Just do what you can. Don't go overboard. I'll throw a hundred dollars in every once in a while
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:03:20
Thats honestly what it feels like trying to understand what happened
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:53:44
Probably it. Or they shut it down so people can't sell to keep the price up
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:02:18
When is the fork supposed to hit?
