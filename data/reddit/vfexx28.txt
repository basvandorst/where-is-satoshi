good question

him quitting coinbase might be a good sign. maybe they intend on working alongside coinbase to implement crypto payments. and what coin does coinbase support?.....bitcoin that's right. so hopefully facebook will support bitcoin soon

I have not included the historical data and I have also removed the blocks and network information for now. I will also get it up and running on its own domain name soon.

With that being said. It is quite obvious major governments have created some sort of task force to "monitor" everything. Shit I bet my real estate agent is working for the government.

That you are correct. if I am correct last year alone they generated 7.9 Billion in revenue. However we are not talking about revenue as bitcoin is not a company. We are talking about  money moving from point A to point B. With that being said Paypal is almost 18 years old and in 2014 moved $228 billion. Uphold.com alone is only 3 years old and has already moved $868,182,613.63 as of 17:00. and that is one company at 7 transactions per second !! 7 ! imagine when that cap is lifted haha

yeah they DEF bent over and took it up the arse by requesting this much customers information.
@_date: 2015-11-22 07:56:27
no its not. they already make money by taking YOUR money and placing buy orders and holding the price up and moving it up then selling. them placing this hidden fee is called Bull shit and being greedy.

It's not a bug ! they added the mid market value plus market depth. they did not have that addition in there. its the only way they keep us from swing trading. just moved my bitcoins out from them... they also just implemented  more bull shit compliance and started asking for more information on their customers.
