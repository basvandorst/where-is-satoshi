I've made sure to engage the old people I love, and inform them on BTC/crypto.
My mom and dad follow it now, and have grown a few hundred dollars into several thousand!
Its a very satisfying feeling to watch the people you love prosper through something like this.
My dad in particular, is 62, diabetic, and a cancer survivor. He hasn't been able to work for a couple of years, and he used to be a very good artist/graphic designer but the cancer treatment left him weak, and combined with some diabetic neuropathy, left him with a tremor. He cannot create the way he used to, and I have watched him suffer emotionally and mentally for it.
Since he started engaging with me about crypto, instead of just listening to me talk about it, he has started bringing money in again (which is important for a man from his generation) and he seems to be sharpening up now that he has something intellectually stimulating like this to engage in every day.
Not all the "old people" will be losers.

When he films it and yells "BUY BITCOIN" over and over again, in a shirt that says "BUY BITCOIN" with his QR Code printed on it, and he earns 15 BTC overnight, he won't feel like an idiot.

Because 1 BTC = 1 BTC.

Most people can't afford to just plop down the cash for a $16,000 car.'
BTC is at 16.5k right now.
The issue for most is that by the time they get $200 or $300 to buy more each paycheck, that $2-300 buys less and less each time, to the point that it seems unattainable.
I started buying when BTC was at $2,200... I bought $1500 worth of several coins, have been putting a little bit in here and there as I could afford it, and now after some bad trades, I only have .52 BTC.
If BTC stayed the same price as it is today, it would take me 13 months at $300 every two weeks to finish buying one, and I doubt that it stays that low between now and then.
This is the problem we are discussing.
For anyone reading this: If getting 1BTC is that easy for you, I'll gladly take an 8k loan nowto buy the remaining .5 BTC, and pay you back at the end of 13 months.

Are you me?

First just buy as many BTC as you can afford from an exchange like Coinbase (1-5 is a good start)  and then move them to your private wallet. Once in your wallet, give your private key to anyone willing to do what we call a "match-donation," and be sure to tell them exactly how many BTC you have in your wallet so they know how many coins to match.
I'd be willing to do your first match-donation if you want.

I'm going to stop this right here.
The /s tag should have given it away but, if I had been serious this would have been a scam for me to take all your BTC.
I made the whole "match-donation" thing up.
Please learn a lesson from this.
Never give your private key to anyone.

OP said he panic sold, and OP2 said not to panic sell.

The smartest of us are generating our private keys  on a 100% offline computer, encrypting them again, and  hollographically etching our new key and cypher into 2 separate glass amulets, storing them in two geographically distant locations which are only  foretold using a second cypher and a copy of the King James Bible.

I'll jump in fairly and bet $100 that bitcoins drop below $1600 (at 2:1 odds) and based on my luck this will keep BTC from dropping below $1601.00 USD (this way I lose 1/3 of the spending power of my BTC while still losing a $100 bet.
You're welcome everybody.

Thats what I thought, thanks. I may buy more in the meantime. I'd really like to have a single BTC and then forget about it for like 2 years (by forget I mean check every week or so rather than every 45 seconds, lol).
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:34:03
Lol, I wish I was the kind of life-hardened SOB who could pull that kind of trick off and still be able to sleep at night.

Do not invest $$ in something you don't understand.
