Don’t be disingenuous! 2MB is hardly “big”. Saying that 2MB vs 1MB blocks “makes it more expensive to host a node” is patently ridiculous. 53GB per year of transactions for storage vs 106GB per year at a time when storage costs 2.5 cents per GB and falling is an insane argument.
The same goes for bandwidth.  
Virtually anybody that so desires can run a full node at 1MB *or* 2MB. A standard home broad band connection is more than sufficient. A junk old computer and a junk hard drive can run this thing no problem with 1MB *or* 2MB blocks.  The biggest cost for running a full node is likely the cost of electricity (for block sizes within reason).
Let’s get fucking serious! A 4TB hard drive costs about $100 these days. After accounting for actual formatted capacity plus the existing blockchain, that’s enough space to hold more than 30 years of completely full 2MB blocks.  Get the fuck out of here if you want to argue about “costs of running a node” when debating a paltry 1MB increase to the block size.
Plus now there is the option to “prune”.
There is a certainly a lot of shit slinging and hyperbole going on on both sides of the table, but let’s get serious and have a real adult discussion here!

Sorry for misunderstanding you.
It seems like as far as storage space goes, there is little problem scaling up block size within reason.
I see now that the “never big block” crowd is claiming it’s bandwidth that is the real problem. 
Do you know where I can read up on that?  
It would be oversimplification to say that only 1 block needs to be received and transmitted every 10 minutes because blocks only occur once every 10 min on average. Sometimes two occur within 10 seconds of each other, and sometimes no block is mined for more than 30 minutes.  But if a node gets left behind temporarily in the uncommon case that a bunch of blocks are mined in rapid succession, it can always catch up during those times when there is a long delay between blocks. This isn’t ideal but it doesn’t destroy the network if some nodes fall temporarily out of sync.
Does anyone have any hard facts and figures for the minimum amount of data a node needs to be able to send and receive before it becomes effectively worthless for a given blocksize?  
As previously mentioned, even a lowly 1 MBPS connection has a theoretical bandwidth of 7.5MB per minute.
With gigabit internet now available to some residential customers in multiple countries, it seems insane to cater to such a low common denominator.  
There are certainly large swaths of the planet where you cannot even get a 1 MBPS connection, shall we scale down to cater to that too?  Should every goat herder living in a yurt be able to run a full node too, perhaps with an EDGE connection they can just barely receive with a giant antenna?
If the argument boils down to we need to support &lt;=1MBPS connections, that’s ridiculous too.

Segwit is obviously not doing what you want. Big blocks will accomplish that for a time. I don’t know what OP is smoking. We got SegWit that opened the door to mining cartels forming and fucking everyone with coins stored on SegWit addresses and did absolutely nothing to solve network congestion and high fees.
So wtf? What is he talking about?!

Then upgrade the shitty third world infrastructure in Australia if you want to use modern technology.  
I have to say, it’s truly shocking the internet is that bad in Australia, but this isn’t a good argument to hold the rest of the world back. I’m sure there are many other places that have even more disastrous network infrastructures than Australia. That isn’t a valid argument for 500kb blocks.
For the record, even at a ridiculously slow 1MBPS, you can still transmit 7.5MB per minute.
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:51:44
This is becoming insane.
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:33:59
I am not buying this argument. It’s super easy to run a node on junk hardware with 1MB blocks. Why would doubling it be such a big deal?
I understand you constantly need to relay the blocks to peers to the best of the ability of your node, but there’s always going to be faster nodes able to relay more and slower nodes that can’t relay as much. This doesn’t break the network. 
Do you have bandwidth figures for current nodes? I’ve run full nodes on and off and have never seen an outrageous amount of bandwidth used. In fact, right now I have one a cheap VPS and it appears to be running properly and always in sync. It’s been up for 25 days.  The average load is virtually nil.  “getnettotals” shows just 4.9GB in and 1.8GB out.  So what am I missing here?
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:18:23
I still haven’t seen a good well supported argument for a 1MB limit after almost 10 years of advancement in CPUs, storage capacity and telecommunications technology since bitcoin was launched (and by the way the 1MB limit didn’t exist when it was launched).
Even the calculator posted above with the intent of proving the need for small blocks, it instead seems to indicate you can still kind of run a node even at 2MB blocks and only a 1MBPS connection.
Furthermore, running nodes in the real world, I have never seen them use the amount of bandwidth projected by that calculator nor as much storage capacity. Yet the nodes always appear to be in sync and running properly.
So go ahead and try to explain it, but at least make a real argument.

Doubling the block size after a period of time has passed where computers have become 60-100 (conservatively) times more powerful and storage much cheaper doesn’t “vastly reduce” anything, least of all security.

The Australian internet sucks this badly? I find it hard to believe.  If that’s the case, Australians need to put down those cans of Foster’s and fix their shitty telecom infrastructure. In the mean time there are plenty of other places to operate nodes from.

My thoughts also...
What can people mine with bitcoin miners besides BCH?  Are there other good options?  How many?  Know where I can find a list?
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:56:25
Of course they do, there have been huge backlogs even since segwit.
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:48:04
It’s ok to lose an argument if you don’t know the answer, but you’re doing in quite a pussy, whiny way.

Why does opt-out replay protection have to invalidate everyone’s time locked transactions?
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:01:01
Nobody has answered the questions I’ve raised above or given any reasonable argument about why segwit is so good and the rest is all shit.
There have been multiple instances of high transaction back logs since segwit:
At this moment getting an average transaction processed without delay costs over $1. There are plenty of times it’s been much higher even after segwit. 
“You don’t understand.” “Stop listening to those big blockers” is not a good argument.

@_date: 2017-10-03 23:49:06
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:43:04
Is it true though? Segwit effectively goes from 1MB to 2.2MB? If that’s the case why does the congestion and high fees remain? What is stopping it from hitting 4MB max during times of high activity?
I guess the means that the extra data is no longer reported in the “block size” on blockchain.info for example. Where can I see the real total data size of each block now? I know that segwit strips the signature data out of the “block” but if the nodes still have to store it’s kind of disingenuous to say the blocks are only 1MB. I also understand that segwit intends to “discard” or at least “optionally discard” the signature data once verified. So is there a way to see the real size of the data live both with the save the signature data option on or off? 
As I understand it, so far, only people using segwit addresses can take advantage of a theoretical 60% capacity increase. However, not that many actually use segwit so it doesn’t automatically deliver this the way a simple block size increase would.
I am not trying to be an asshole I’m just actually trying to learn but it’s really hard to sift through all the bullshit and mid-slinging on both sides. Right now a simple increase in block size seems like the best solution and segwit seems like a bad idea for many reasons. Neither one is an end all be all, it’s a intermediate capacity increase on a long journey. But SegWit seems very complicated, in some ways illogical ( and potentially dangerous ( I believe there are counter arguments but I have not heard a good one that makes any sense. For me what makes most sense is something like a simple 2-4MB larger block and continuing the discussion about what to do next.
I’m sure the knee jerk reaction of many will be to attack the messenger and while I’m no fan of fake Satoshi his argument on the mining cartels seems reasonable and I have not heard or read a good counter argument.
I’m more than happy to update my opinions based on new information and I’m trying to figure out exactly what to do with yet another hard fork looming on the horizon.  Based on everything I read to date though, segwit plus no block size increase seems like the absolute worst option. Obviously there are some important elements I’ve missed, but as I said, it’s really hard to wade through all the bullshit.

No.  If you put in $5 last year it would be worth $50 today.  $5 or $20 per month is better than nothing.  You might lose it, but bitcoin might still go up 10 or 50 or 100 or 1000 times (admittedly 1,000 is near the outer limits of possibility but it's still possible).   
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:52:08
Put in $5.
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:42:34
The few nodes Australia runs even with 1MB blocks would not be missed.
Of the 9519 nodes online in the last 24 hours Australia had just 138 of them, or 1.5% of the total. 
Of the top 10 countries, 7 are highly developed countries with no shortage of affordable high speed bandwidth; those countries make up 67% of the total nodes.
Those running nodes at home on their 1MBPS ADSL connections in the outback are not going to be missed.
Furthermore, there is no reason an enthusiast with a shitty internet connection cannot run a full node on a cheap VPS, albeit it in “prune node” as that *could* get a bit expensive as the entire block chain starts to reach multiple 100s of GB or even &gt;= 1TB.
