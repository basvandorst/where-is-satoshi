I have the same issue. Sent this message to Support:












 after a few hours, I got this response and nothing since:

Good point, very plausible.

Him and the (now) $150mil pizza guy.

Gotta find a talking mudcrab.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:13:21
Oh man. My favorite "shouldda hodl'd" story, (besides my own). I remember being amused by this is 2013 (when the price was less than $100).
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:05:33
You're welcome :(
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:00:58
This is kind of my point. There were a few people in there fighting the good fight, but there's a lot of derp in there. Several genuinely interested people got lost and may not bother to look into it and we lose them. Its fine to say "they will come around eventually", but we need to grow the community now. Think like a start up business.
@_date: 2014-01-05 17:20:31
Goddamn I missed you.
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:35:16
Hope is a powerful thing :(

That, and the last bubble was caused largely by Gox's fukery.
@_date: 2014-09-06 23:07:10
That's a damn good deal assuming it doesn't need any work and hasn't been in any accidents. Somebody buy it!
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:42:32
Not to mention, its a gauge to show how much damage the Gox story has done.
@_date: 2014-09-06 23:10:07
I'm sure somebody here would gladly design a vinyl wrap for it.
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:50:36
Oh, I'm with you 100%. Its just sad to see people so dismissive about it when they only see the bad headlines.
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:36:53
The argument against BTC they missed is that if your credit card is stolen, personal info is stolen, or bank is hacked, there are consumer protections that will reimburse you. Even if you do something stupid like leave your card on the counter at the store or something. I don't know if there could be some kind of insurance though, since it would hard to prove you didn't just send funds to another account.

I was a long time FARKer before finding Reddit and I hated the comment system here at first. But now I can see that it actually works pretty good and lets actual smaller conversations happen without having to quote the people you're responding to. In fact, I think this layout would have helped the thread I linked because people who were curious get more or less lost in the mountain of comments.

Maybe he has a shred of integrity and realize he fucked up and Gox wouldn't ever have credibility with him still in charge. Cutting his own dead weight so that Gox can live? Just another angle...
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:48:59
Haha, I found it in my teens about ten years ago. Its sad how lame it is now, I used to really like FARK.
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:05:25
Yep, Reddit took over everything.
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:56:07
Hello old friend.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:49:17
You're in the right place friend.
@_date: 2019-01-31 11:25:13
Pretty much.
Plus if anybody actually gave a shit and was willing to do something themselves instead of point fingers, they'd have gone vegan long ago as that is the best thing you can do for the environment right now, today.

 New-wave tried to destroy the Bitcoin, but the Bitcoin had its way

This. The willful ignorance of Willy around here is disappointing. When people don't know or gloss over that episode, I know I'm not talking to a realist.

Lesson 1:
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:07:04
Crazy right? And that came out a few years ago, who knows what madness has occurred since then.
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:51:52
Sold my 6BTC @ ~$235 when it dropped from $255 (originally bought at $78). Then of course it went right back up. The next day, bought 10BTC  Only time I've lost my resolve to hold.

This is why I'm in CampBX. Based in Alpharetta, GA.

Sorry Patrick
@_date: 2013-04-25 09:16:24
Yep here's one for double that just popped up.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:13:31
Bitfinex verified me within an hour a few days ago.

"Happily married" too apparently. She seemed to nod or smile whenever Patrick made a positive, pro-BTC point. Which would make sense becasue they both work at the Bitcoin Foundation. GGJ
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:38:01
Identity confirmed!
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:14:09
going back up.....
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:55:09
If you believe (like many of us) that BTC will be worth a lot more in a few months, let alone years, go for it. Rule  applies: don't risk more than you can afford to lose. It's obvious that in the short term, none of us has any clue what will happen.

What exchange are you using?
