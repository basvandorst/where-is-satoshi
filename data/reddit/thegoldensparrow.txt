Noob question, how did he calculate this value? Doesnt it depend on the difficulty on the network during the last bitcoin?

Imagine Bitcoin as giant Nokia in the 90s and Apple as Altcoin bypasing Nokia in year 2000.
If bitcoin is not keeping up with time (performance, adaption, usability, etc.), its not crazy to think that some specialized altcoins may have a chance.

Could you not just make a hardfork of bitcoin and issue higher supply?
Before you say, you can just refuse to fork, then what do you do, if shops dont accept it anymore as they are gov regulated?
Not fud, just concerns and i would be glad to be educated, if thats not the case
