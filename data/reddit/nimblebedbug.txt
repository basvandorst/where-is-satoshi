The main thing imo is how many people get involved regardless of price.
If you can use it all over the world in some form or another, that is a success.
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:30:12
You can't CREATE money with bitcoin in this way.  You can only loan out EXACTLY what is either deposited or mined.
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:05:53
Nahh...it is an investment right now.  It is speculation and there's nothing wrong with that.  It's great for adoption actually.
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:46:48
If you guys want to trade bitcoin go on a god dam exchange and NOT coinbase.
No one gives a shit if you "lost" fiat.
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:53:11
You basically can't stop what it really is.  It is better money.  It is money that can't be cheated and can't be watered down.  It is a new money that beats everything that came before it.
People always trade something worse for something better if they can.  This is a new paradigm that can't be framed in terms of what came before it.
@_date: 2013-11-04 06:13:07
Hmm...who mandates that the states require registration?
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:50:19
Guy explained it to you already a few posts up and your dumb ass still doesn't get it.  
It's guys like you that make newcomers afraid of a damn good service like coinbase.
I seriously fucking hate you.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:05:27
Coinbase.com.  It is and likely will always be the best way for newcomers to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:11:35
It's not that bad in the US.  It's bad, but not that bad.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:22:30
Well go find em big boy.  They ain't there.  Smart folks lock in gains and play with the rest.  They are smart folks.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:32:45
Watch this guys videos.
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:26:58
coinbase.com is the best we got.  That's the bottom line.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:38:41
cryptsy.com and coinex.pw are two.
I think there is room for 20+ different currencies personally.  I don't think there is ANY room for fiat any more.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:31:12
I see you're point.  I don't think you're a sellout if you convert to fiat and buy real tangibles, i.e. houses, land, businesses, gold.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:49:15
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:50:37
I agree with you as well.  The media is controlled by big money.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:29:18
What I think will happen is the new millionaires will unload btc as they go along to buy houses, land, businesses, gold.
I know I will.  It only makes sense.  It's also good for bitcoin imo.
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:45:25

Now I can't tell you if this price is crazy high or not.  I just vouch for Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:20:45
There is no nonsense with coinbase.  Don't let the handful of loudmouth dicks with a problem they just can't wait on turn you off.  
They are the best.
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:25:41
You have adjusted your initial argument now that you get it.  You clearly see that banks loan out more money than they actually have. You are attempting to be deceptive.  I'm glad you see the truth now though and no longer think this regarding banks:


@_date: 2013-11-03 03:24:40
How much of a salary did you pay yourself with this made up money before bankruptcy anyhow?
Thanks for watering down the store of value for all those that actually work for a living.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:06:03
I don't think it matters if  you just hold.  Good Job!!
Just think if it goes to 1 million per coin.
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:48:45
Fuck if I know.
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:11:36

Oh, I don't know.  Probably every one of you fucking scammers that create a new account just to say this bullshit.
Likely just one dude.
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:07:10
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:00:57
Coinbase IS awesome.  A lot of folks try to buy more than 10K at once which must be reported so they simply don't do orders like that in most cases.
If I have to choose between my order possibly not going through or all my coins getting stolen like at input.io, I'll take the former.
Also, a lot of dicks like to treat coinbase like it's an exchange.  It's not an exchange.  If you want to day trade, go some where else.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:24:57
If you don't fucking like it go to a real damn exchange and quit fucking whining like a bitch.
COINBASE IS NOT A FUCKING EXCHANGE FOR TRADERS.  IT IS MEANT FOR THOSE THAT BUY AND HOLD LONG TERM.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:31:30
You're going to have to explain why this is dumb?  This is meant to be sarcastic.  Folks should be able to tell other folks what they want.
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:30:50
The ultra elite CANNOT prop up their wealth by creating money and/or getting loans they really never have to pay back.
Translation...matter your wealth, you will have to provide real services to humanity to maintain it in a bitcoin world.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:21:17
Guy makes an account here and one post just to post this libel against Coinbase.
I think not.
I'm seeing quite a few of these types of bullshit stories tonight against coinbase.
I've used them many, many, many, many, many times and had no problems.
Mods should delete all negative posts against coinbase from unestablished users imo.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:29:14
When this "bubble" pops, and it stabilizes around 200, what will you call the next peak at 1000?  Another bubble?  How about the peak after that at 2000?  Then the 10,000 peak?

You CAN'T loan out more money than you get in deposits.  You seem to think that doesn't happen under the current system.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:20:04
I hold Bitcoin, LiteCoin and GoldCoin.  I hold the first two because they were first to market and the last because it has a great name, great community and forward thinking development behind it.
You can check out all coins at coinmarketcap.com.
Purists will always down vote you though for any other coin support even though it's insane to deny other coins.  It's not like any coin will ever unseat bitcoin and disparaging other coins only makes bitcoin look bad in my opinion.

It would actually have to be altered in the third step.  Let's say you deposited 100 BTC and the bank loaned 90 BTC to Susie.  Well you then could not withdraw your money even if done over multiple days.

Now do you get it?

Hey, count me in on your lawsuit man.  I'd love to testify against YOUR SORRY ASS for this slanderous libel.
I can't wait until dicks like you that claim to have "lost" something you never had file a lawsuit.  I'll be the first to say you're a predatory peace of shit that would have cried had the price of bitcoin gone down and claimed coinbase should have protected you.

Bitcoin truly is like modern gold.  It is both an investment and a currency.
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:52:24
That's true but in a bitcoin only world, the banks would collapse if they kept this model.  Folks wouldn't keep their bitcoins in banks that weren't VERY rigorous with the loans they gave out.
The days of giving out loans to your ultra rich buddy for his "business" and not having to worry about going under would be over.
@_date: 2013-11-03 03:41:20
LMFAO!  That's loaning out honest money there brother.  That is nothing like the current fractional reserve system.  
In that scenario you can NEVER loan out more than you've received.  That is NOT the case in the current system.   Money can actually be created from deposits essentially as it is.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:38:25
Buy some...any amount.  Secure it to the best of your ability.  Check on the price every day and as you learn how fucking unbelievable it really is, tell all your friends and family to follow the same recipe.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:33:01
Let's look at China for instance.  If the 50K (probably a lot fewer) Chinese that are buying bitcoin never release any, it will not spread to others in China and most others will see it as bunk made up money.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:07:53
Nahh...you simply can't have a real world economy where 10,000 people have 99.999% of the wealth.  It doesn't matter how divisible the coins are.  That is, unless you trick people and that's hard to do with the openness of bitcoin.
I think if it doesn't spread out more, it will fail.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:27:57
The difference is these waves are getting bigger and bigger and the water is covering more and more of the land.  The general trend is heading towards a complete flood.

No, you're one of thousands of people that order from them.  Your shit didn't go smoothly so you come on here badmouthing the best company the bitcoin world has.  
You scare off some folks from getting into the bitcoin world and contribute to lowering overall adoption.
Why?  Because you're a selfish dick with no patience.
@_date: 2013-11-04 06:13:36

Do you see a problem with your math here at all?
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:56:08
I have bitcoins.  I don't spend them.  I spend my cheap, easy money.  As more people accept bitcoin, I will spend some of it as it will be easier.
I imagine taking vacations on another continent and never having to convert for instance.
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:53:00
Yes.  Also, spread the word to friends and family about bitcoin.
Everyone needs to at least know about it.
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:12:04
Make sure you convince others to take bitcoin in tourist areas.  Imagine the power of not having to convert money if you travel internationally to major tourist locations.
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:50:29
Here are some things they can try:
1) Network disruption through collecting known ip addresses/etc.
2) Making it illegal to buy/sell bitcoins.  
3) Running Smear Campaigns with fake news stories and white papers from paid academics 
4) Making it illegal to mine in the US
5) Seizing the domains and making it non-existent as a search word
6) Seizing the assets of all bitcoin related companies in the US
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:38:50
If it becomes the world's reserve currency then...no.

Good point.  You would think they'd be all over this already.
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:16:24
I really, really think the bitcoin foundation should focus on getting ALL tourist areas around the world to accept bitcoin. 
It would be wonderful to travel to all major tourist areas and only have to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:33:19
The wild swings up bring a lot of attention in, so yes, adoption is affected by that--a lot.
Most of the people here are only here because the price has been going up a lot.

Try your luck at inputs.io.  That's the place for scammers like you.

I have the Bitcoin-QT wallet on my computer and I transfer the coins to an address I generate there.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:58:10
Bitcoin Devil, your understanding of the world is off.  The government cannot simply do this without a LOT of people questioning it.  
This could happen in China but their leaders are actually intelligent enough to recognize the opportunity to make their citizens very wealthy at this point in time and are actually promoting Bitcoin on state television.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:07:11
Sorry for the all caps not man.  I'm a little tired of the coinbase bashing lately.
Coinbase is the best we have.  It's very solid and they don't cheat people.  It's the best thing for newcomers and I've just been getting annoyed that the mods let folks bash when they are just complaining that their order didn't go through.
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:00:32

Total number of bitcoins = 11,966,225
1000 x 10,000 = 10,000,000
So you're suggesting, the entire current bitcoin market outside of these 1000+ guys are playing with 1,966,225 bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:29:13
You are having a comprehension problem.  This statement from the article explains it completely.


@_date: 2013-11-03 05:32:26
Look back in history and you'll see the general populace was much less kind to bankers (and bank robbers) when money was lost in the past.  
With little accountability (corporate bankruptcy and bailouts) loans are not measured and weighed with proper seriousness.  Also, with money being printed out of thin air, the corruption is rampant in this process--fucking the little man by devaluing the dollars he earns and saves.
Anyhow, I'm done with this conversation as you really don't want to see past your false version of reality.  
Give it time and if bitcoin succeeds, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.  The ultra rich will have to actually provide real services to mankind to stay ultra rich.  They can't just game the system as they are doing with the process I described.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:46:44
You mean the logical nature that they have to report 10k purchases and over so they choose not to do them.
Dumb ass.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:36:02
The thing is the doubt will make them sell to lock in some gains causing bitcoin to spread that much more.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:20:25
Unload to fiat, convert to tangibles...done.
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:25:21

Bitcoin is the first and the soundest right now and for the foreseeable future.  It doesn't hurt to buy a little of many different types though.
Personally I have the most in bitcoin, some in litecoin and some in goldcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:43:10
Yes...but maybe not as quickly.  The more vendors that accept it, the more people have a reason to purchase it.
For instance, it would be great if tourist sites around the world started accepting it.  That way, when folks traveled to multiple itineraries, they would only have to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:47:11
You're not out.  You're just paying off debt homeboy.  Buy a coin or two and just chill like the rest of us.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:12:18
Another scenario, they start buying en masse.  They get the ball rolling on the largest wealth transfer mankind has ever seen and it reaches a point where their bitcoin purchases are worth more than their company. 
Not being stupid, they start to slowly sell some of the btc to pull out profits but have permanently raised the value of btc.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:15:37
There are probably less than 100 early adopters left with that many coins.  I'm telling you the temptation to lock in gains is WAY too strong.
That itself is a benefit to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:29:51
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:24:10
Pics or it didn't happen.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:25:45
It's not crazy to spend bitcoins.  That is your opinion. 
For instance, let's say you have 100btc in cold storage and want the value to increase.  How can you do your part to get the word out?  You can buy bitcoins and support businesses that do accept them.  If this was money you would have spent anyhow on the same things, you might as well do it while bolstering the bitcoin economy any way you can.
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:20:02
Dude..you haven't missed anything.  9/10 of those that bought earlier have already cashed out and bought big houses. 
In the long run, if bitcoin succeeds, each coin will be worth upwards of a million dollars.
Get a coin, get half a coin.  It doesn't matter.  Get 25 dollars worth.  If not, you'll just be saying this again next year.
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:46:49
I feel sorry for him, his family and friends if the massive adoption occurs.  His ego may prevent him from just admitting he was wrong and getting in before a massive wealth transfer occurs.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:40:11
I've already given you the math suggesting that is wrong.  I can't do any more than that.
Hell human nature is what will make bitcoin spread imo.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:09:07
Maybe if you're younger.  That just looks like a typical Friday night for some of us.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:48:39
Look in the mirror.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:09:06
They would go bankrupt trying to buy it.  As they bought it, the price would dramatically rise.  A lot of folks would NOT let go of the btc they have and folks may just panic buy into the huge buys for fear of missing out.  Also the human psyche tends to like to buy into rallies as the appearance of HUGE success is just too much.
In short, they would cause bitcoin to have a market cap of half a trillion if they tried.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:37:21
Stop trying to game bitcoin to make US dollars.  No one can tell you this because folks like you aren't asking the right questions.
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:50:51
I am unsure anymore if volume is a great predictor of price with bitcoin because as the price goes up clearly there will be less volume in total btc transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:34:53
That is entirely untrue.  They have already done it.  If this were the case, the first 5 guys mining it would have kept everything they had.  Think about it.
They didn't.
I think the doubt is actually helping bitcoin spread.
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:32:26
So the banks have not created money?  Is that still your argument?
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:00:56
You know truthfully though, for this thing to really take off, I think folks will have to give in to selling pressure.  
Ultimately most folks now shouldn't really own more than a couple of bitcoins, otherwise it will be too skewed and no one will want in.
Just a thought.
Of course if you hold for a few years and and have a couple of millions, you'll likely lock in those gains with external assets.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:36:56
You should have gone to inpust.io.  I here they got there orders straight away.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:38:37
Their names should be permanently stored in the blockchain along with their comments.
All the regulators, congressmen and bankers that try to stop bitcoin should also have their names permanently recorded in the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:33:30
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:57:30
I don't think so.  Right now the potential is far too great for people to spend it.  As it maintains it's value more businesses will accept it and more people will spend it.  
They will always spend a worse asset first though.
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:51:16
I can't entirely explain this as I'm no major math head.  I asked the same question before as this is actually at the root of hacking bitcoin.
From my understanding, statistically it would be harder to generate the same address than getting struck by lightning while surfing on the back of a great white shark that was taught the english language and knew how to take commands from you and trained itself to use a gps to navigate where you told it to go while it was also riding on the back of a whale that had recently graduated Harvard in 2 years and come up with a working unified field theory.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:43:59
Hey dude...set up a damn bitcoin fund for them like Satoshi Forest.
Seriously.  I'd love to see some poor ass village folk do something like that.

You are right.  It's all in the news.  They say it's for drug dealers and money launderers.  If you're not one of those...stay away.
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:08:25
This statement is entirely untrue.


@_date: 2013-11-08 16:18:06
TL;DR 
Coinbase is awesome, you're likely a selfish complaining fuck.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:28:59
Me Chinese.  Me play joke.  Me sell bitcoin when you woke.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:17:58
It doesn't matter.  If bitcoin becomes the world's reserve currency, the ultra rich will not just be able to print money and get loans from those that do that they never have to pay back.
They'll actually have to provide real services to mankind or watch their supply of bitcoin slowly dwindle.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:17:05
It depends on your age and risk tolerance.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:14:36
I'm wondering who you are.   You're in EVERY one of these  posts bad mouthing the shit out of coinbase.
You sir are a paid dick or a pathetic fucking piece of human trash.
Coinbase is the best.  I defend them because they are and I'm sick of the handful of loudmouth fucks coming on here trashing them cause things didn't work perfectly.
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:20:18
Coinbase.com is the easiest and most trustworthy.

Ok.  Tell them ALL they need to buy 300 bitcoins NOW.  That's roughly 36 dollars apiece.
If bitcoin goes to a million a piece, each person there will have 100k.
I know this is likely very impossible.
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:00:50
Companies that buy and sell bitcoins must register as money transmitters and pay extreme fees.  This alone has greatly slowed the adoption of bitcoin. 
My argument is that the legislation is endorsed and encouraged with great resources by the central bankers to maintain a monopoly on money.

Actually the funds came out of his imagination.  I don't think this even happened.  Both the guys claiming this made these accounts just to complain about the same thing.
Sounds a little fishy.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:09:55
That would be awesome in my book.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:19:29
Coinbase is awesome.  You're likely a selfish fuck that wouldn't say shit if their algorithm kicked in if the price lowered between the time you bought and got your coins.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:14:01
Your stupid ass post might have turned off 10 fucking newcomers to bitcoin because you bashed the most trusted way for them to acquire coins and have a positive experience.
You should go spank yourself and put yourself in the corner with a dunce hat on you selfish ass.
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:09:47
1 go fuck yourself Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:50:17
Sorry I misspelled damn.  Maybe that's why you downvoted me?  If not, fuck you!!

Most of these Chinese have few options to invest.  This is actually a good investment for them EVEN if it crashes to 100.

The right thing to do is for you to grow the fuck up.
@_date: 2013-11-03 03:55:22
Dude...you are entirely incorrect.  Seriously what I have told you is totally true.  
Go do some reading and prepare for your mind to be blown.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:09:57
It will spread out though.  The temptation to lock in gains is too strong.  If you're holding onto 100+ coins, I guarantee you you'll cave.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:16:38
They will lock in gains.  There is no doubt in my mind.  We've just started the speculation period.
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:07:44
I'm upvoting you for not upvoting my homeboy.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:17:09
My guess is you're a bitcoin detractor that wants to slow adoption.
@_date: 2013-11-03 05:13:59
There's nothing wrong with that.  The point is the banks would be far more careful with lending money AND the corruption level with loans would be far less.
I think you'd see more honest loans.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:17:59
Bitcoin is expanding in waves.  It's hard to tell you what part of the wave it's currently in.  It's clearly not the bottom of the wave but it may not be the top. 
Should you wait for the bottom of the next wave or buy now and just let a bunch of waves accumulate over a year?  Who knows?
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:15:10
Best case: You can buy 100 dollars worth and watch the value increase month by month.
Worst case:  You can buy 100 dollars worth and have a lottery ticket that never stops providing entertainment for the rest of your life.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:13:51
A 20-30k rig just to break even.
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:32:54
At this point, many politicians would lose their jobs.   Central bankers will try this possibly or they may realize the game is up and buy a ton of bitcoin.  They likely already have and are by using very, very talented traders that know how to keep the value down the whole time.
