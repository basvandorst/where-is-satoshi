It may mean that bulls used too narrow stops because of uncertainty, but it also can be a sign of new short positions opened.

The blockchain is open. You can track all transactions related to those wallets. But if those coins reach an exchange, you will not know when those sell orders will be executed.

MtGox wallets are still not empty. The pattern you noticed can be because of the selloffs too.

It's a contactless cold storage that securely store a reserve of cryptocurrency offline. No transaction just a secure, encrypted medium.
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:41:54
That's huge. I am really curious about the outcome.
@_date: 2019-11-14 15:12:43
I have never seen a bank card with a QR code, but contactless bankcards are widely adopted worldwide.
@_date: 2019-11-14 15:14:27
Cards are shielded and the stored data is also encrypted so if the bad actor could somehow read the data, it is still worthless to him.
@_date: 2019-11-14 15:08:50
Yes it is a cold storage crypto wallet. You can not do payments with this, but you can securely store a reserve of any cryptocurrency. You can think about it as an encrypted, digital paper wallet.  
All cards have an RFID shield sleeve that blocks NFC readers to access the card's chip. Data is also encrypted so you are absolutely safe when you walk with it.  
We will introduce some integration partnerships with software wallets in the near future. This device will be used to lock and put some cryptocurrency reserve from software to cold storage and vice-versa.
@_date: 2019-11-15 08:11:10
Why would this matter if the payload - the data - is encrypted **before** sent to the wallet card?  
You can not use the encrypted data to access the cryptocurrency reserve without knowing the encryption key.   
For example when you encrypt a file, it does not matter who can see your encrypted data, because people can not obtain the original content without knowing the encryption key.  
Contactless bankcards are different because when you know the data it stores, you can use that data to authenticate yourself at terminals.
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:58:09
That was pretty complete
@_date: 2019-02-01 18:39:03
You are right, this is possible with an NFC sticker.
But we have a very high quality NFC chip, and we are working on our application, which provides additional security by encrypting the data before writing it to the card.
This way you do not need to trust a third party who is generating your PK (like Tangem does).
@_date: 2019-02-02 12:47:16
It is just a demo, to present the basics. Our application runs offline. Take a look at the security checklist feature!
BTW every card comes with an RFID blocking sleeve, which protects the card from unauthorized scanning attempts. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:46:13
This way the data is written directly to the card. If you are looking for additional encryption levels, take a look at the [application]( we are developing!

I also think so, but for some reasons I don't like that all trades made during the contracting period are not trigger any real trades on the spot market. So it's nothing but pairing bets until the settlement.
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:26:55
Exactly. Only one - huge - real trade would be made. On settlement OR before the ETF is established.  
All the other trades are just paired bets, that make the clearing house rich instead of HODL-ers.
@_date: 2019-09-28 09:22:29
I got you, price discovery is a good advantage. 
Derivatives causes a similar effect to inflation, which is against the limited supply what is one of the best features of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-28 09:35:45


But they are not real market makers, they don't even buy or sell a single sat when trading a derivative.

Yes it means that your hardware wallet (Ledger or Trezor) is as safe as your seed phrase storage method. Everything else is just a UI for the blockchain.

That seed phrase (the words) are used to generate the PK itself. So knowing the seed phrase and knowing the PK means same level of access (if you know the algorithm, that generates the PK from the seed phrase).
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:48:39
I think buying bitcoin securely now is not so hard, but storing it securely is the problem. Especially if you want to have high liquidity (aka fast transaction when you need it).
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:58:00
In reality you can not say that PK never leaves the device because the seed phrase exists before the PK is generated. So technically the PK (as the seed phrase) is already existing outside of the device before it is saved onto the device itself.
It is just marketing stuff that make people believe it's secure.
@_date: 2018-12-22 20:24:23
Cards are shipped with RFID blocker sleeve + the data is encrypted when using our application, so it's no problem :)
@_date: 2019-05-15 11:52:28
Why is it a "so secure" way, when PK not leaves the device, while the seed phrase is stored as plain text on a paper?
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:14:56
Because they don't understand how it works and because of the horror stories about stolen coins and frauds.
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:30:53
Generating a wallet and storing the PK without any third parties on a truly secure environment is very complicated for non tech savvy people.
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:26:54
Smart money buys only if it can be sure about the security of the purchased assets. That's why CFD-s and the ETF topic is more popular among fund managers and professional traders. They don't want to take the risk of owning the asset for real, just to make money on price changes.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:11:32

@_date: 2018-12-30 12:38:58
Hmmm strange you say these kind of things. We are not a huge company, but a bunch of mates, who risked own capital and time to develop the product. If you would see our crowdfunding page you would know that.
Whitslack's point is right, yes the product MAYBE not the perfect way for long term storage (decades). But USB sticks also have these kind of disadvantages. Printed papers also gets damaged during time. So furthermore every kind of hardware wallets have these risks and even more because they contains many components and every piece can fail. BTW recovering data from a damaged complex hardware is much harder. 
However the NFC chip is more simple than those complex hardwares, therefore theoretically the risk of failure is much lower. We use the highest quality chips produced by Smartrac to bring the highest reliability possible by the technology. 
Our NFC solution is an ALTERNATIVE way for cold storage. Why would you use an USB drive with 4GB capacity to store several bytes of data? USB drives have many components can be damaged. I am pretty sure you also had USB stick which just stopped working. An infected or poorly working computer can easily damage your USB drives, and you won't even know that until it completely fails.
Every card comes with an RFID shield sleeve, which acts like a Faraday cage, therefore it adds protection for the NFC chip and increases self life.
The card is the backup, if you are worry, make a clone every N month/years or something.

Yes I think this is a huge part of the problem. Most popular question I heard from no coiners is "What if somebody makes more bitcoins?". Most people can not understand how limited supply is ensured. And after 2017 when many forks was made, I actually understand them.

I would use ASICs only, behind a VPN network.

Yes, most people still not recognize the risk of keeping all of their money in a bank account. Even after financial crisises and many well-known cases of frauds in the bank sector.
They just too lazy, they don't want to understand new things. They just want to use their plastic cards to buy shit.
@_date: 2018-12-23 07:25:47
The data itself can be encrypted before it's written to the chip. You can use any NFC app. You can do your own encryption and save that encrypted text to the card.
However our app can handle the encryption, so you don't have to do it yourself.

It does not have infinite shelf life. Nothing has. However we created this product to replace the usage of USB sticks and printed PK-s. And NFC is a cool tech anyway :)
@_date: 2018-12-22 21:10:32
This card is designed to keep your private key in **cold storage**. It's like an NFC vault. Application is to provide [additional features]( and [security levels]( (to encrypt content). The app has nothing to do with transactions.
It's your decission how to generate your keys, and yes it should be generated offline.

@_date: 2018-12-30 13:19:24
Except if you send the data encrypted. Then they engrave the encrypted data, but only you know the encryption key.
@_date: 2018-12-23 07:20:58
You can choose from multiple security levels.
With level ONE you can encrypt the content using the encryption password you enter. 
With level TWO you can encrypt the content using our key card, which is a hardware key. 
With level THREE you can encrypt the content using an encryption key AND a key card. This way the key card acts like a 2FA key. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:31:20

Stupid masses overall money is nothing compared to the big ones stashes.
@_date: 2018-12-22 22:12:34
Yes the the PK should be read from the card only if you want to move to hot wallet. Our vision is to make a very secure cold storage card, therefore the card does not communicate with any devices by itself. It's a passive chip. We do not want to add that kind of features, because we want to keep things as simple as possible.
The card has nothing to do with signing either, it's a vault for your secret data.
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:16:49
Tell me more!
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:38:39
Idk, but one thing is sure: if all derivative trades would be replaced by real trades on the spot market, where people actually buy real bitcoins, the price can skyrocket. 
At the moment most brokers who offer for example CFD or future trading has no real trades on the background (exempt manipulation to stop out their clients), they just pair their clients positions and take the profit. 
Unfortunately same thing can happen not just with brokers, but exchanges. Remember when they just do not allow withdrawals for days, or weeks. The reason is, that they actually do not have the liquidity to do that.

Extreme obfuscation brings no real protection, just problems for you when accessing data. If your protection based on not being obvious, you have no security in reality.
@_date: 2018-12-23 17:55:26
The app is designed to securely save and view the data. If you need the key you have to access it manually (by opening the card)
