Would be interesting to know
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:21:50
It'll be there and it will be stronger than we thought
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:26:30
Ledger HW.1 Hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:00:52
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:00:43
Buy and hodl then
@_date: 2017-02-22 06:43:00
We're still waiting for a second and third part though
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:03:08
It won't drop that far
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:01:43
But we've learned from it and it was raising again
@_date: 2017-02-10 13:44:13
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:58:35
Thanks a lot. I'll try!
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:22:01
Sorry, this is the TX Id
@_date: 2017-02-12 21:57:53
What happens then? How's that ETF going to affect Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:31:23
I already tried the txaccelerator, thanks for recommending it :-)
Yes, there's an option. I didn't check the current transaction fees before sending the bitcoins and choose "normal" tx-fees.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:35:11
Just for the sake of having a fan
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:56:59
No. You'll have to set them up manually
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:14:03
Yes. I wanted to 3D print it
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:29:13
You shouldn't does not mean you couldn't.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:44:18
3D printed it'd be around 30€ incl. shipping
@_date: 2017-02-11 10:23:13
the honeybadger does not give a shit
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:11:42
Thanks for the compliment btw :D
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:25:40
It's not tested yet, so I can't say which way is more efficient
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:10:20
pruned mode. 
I took a look at this project: 
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:34:41
Yes, yes please! I'd love to see the 3D printed case.
I'll send you the files in a few hours - what would the cost per case be (approx.)?
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:30:32
yessir. 
As it's designed to run 24/7 I thought of active cooling as a good idea in terms of stability.
The mount is for a 80mm fan.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:03:52
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:24:53
I'd build it just for the sake of having a fan-cooled Raspi node - it does not have to be efficient in any way tbh.
Thanks for your advice anyway!
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:27:32
It's a FUD processor
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:10:54
Of course a 60mm fan would've done the job but a major influence was the fact that  I already have  several 80mm fans :D
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:28:37
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:26:02
no. a 80mm fan on top of it.
drinks in that hole are not recommended

!RemindMe 10 days "950 BTC harddrive"
@_date: 2017-01-29 14:00:24
probably too slow

"Oh look, a popular dude claimed Bitcoin to be capable of being worth 100000 bucks, let's go insane"
Aaaaah, I love this sub
@_date: 2017-01-05 07:34:46
Just trying to circlejerk as everyone else here and hoping it will skyrocket further :\^)
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:45:56
Daytrading in crypto is like shooting yourself in the leg for pension
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:03:07

I lost 4k$ in NEO a couple of days ago because of  the same reason. Feeling with you brother
@_date: 2017-01-02 07:46:35
Done. 
Would be interested in seeing the results soon

Not this post in particular but posts like this in general
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:46:42
Goldman Sachs predicted the price to be 2200$ 
Many people think Goldman Sachs now sells their holdings in order to manipulate the price so their prediction is right
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:42:39
that would be fucked up
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:20:16
Thats no proper Russian 
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:31:40
Every side makes mistakes but there is no point in blaming each other for things out of each others responsibility
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:46:00
And there is not even the slightest form of a reason for that
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:19:43
the Americans love to blame the Russians
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:53:23
shapeshift is better
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:16:17
I am Russian
You don't know Russians as it seems

Had a huge spin up and a correction several days ago.
Claimed to be Chinas Ethereum I think it's worth looking at.
