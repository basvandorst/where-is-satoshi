When naysayers convince you to keep something you believe in bottled up, they've done their job.
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:55:44
I'm sorry.  I don't understand how the two are related.  This is confusing.  The person just wants to send me bitcoin.  I'd like to be able to use it but it's a no go if I can't buy groceries with it.  
  
@_date: 2014-07-04 13:09:48
Actually when bitcoin was first started by Satoshi, it spread rapidly because he kept it to himself.  Apparently if you take published works, and bury them in the sand, they become really popular since no one ever reads them.
I think there is a disconnect from reality now.  Bitcoiners are training one another to NOT advertise anymore.  It's very unhealthy for it's growth.  If you can't understand this, I can't help you.

You must not come here a lot or you're fucking blind.  Some small vendor was offering 30% off a few days ago.  Go back and read the damn post history moron.
Hell you don't have to leave reddit to find that.  It's amazing how many idiots there are here that keep drawing a line in the sand for bitcoin and moving it further and further back as it crosses each one.  
When Bitcoin starts to make a huge rush upwards again, you'll see even steeper discounts.
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:19:03
That's fine.  If that's the case, it needs to be given to all people equally.
@_date: 2014-07-04 14:32:19
Exactly.  That's the key.   If you talk about it and they are curious, it benefits everyone if you really show them.
There is a huge difference between that and proselytizing.
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:05:23
I think we're going to need to see more adoption to get it to hold above 600.  Maybe just time but bitcoin users need to get back to the roots of telling others about it.  Apparently, that's a sin now.
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:29:58
Not sure why this got a downvote.  I don't have anything to do with the company but they have some cheap laptops.  I was searching for the same thing a few weeks ago and I am happy.  Got one for like 129 bucks.  
Somebody else post some good sites.
@_date: 2014-07-10 12:42:16
We need to find a better way to pay the devs.
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:40:57
You're simply wrong.  You don't make anything grow without advertising.  Basic fact.
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:18:18
We need to get back to the basics.  People can say you are pumping or whatever but this is the simple truth.  Now if the person isn't interested don't push of course but if they strike up a conversation or you do and they seem interested...show them.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:05:03
Is there something there that can be transferred to bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-20 17:04:09
Many merchants are starting to offer steep discounts for bitcoin payments.  I've seen some as much as 30%.  So you could buy an item for 100 dollars or buy an item for 70 dollars.
@_date: 2014-07-19 23:51:25
I see.  So this method won't work because the Food Lion gift cards just have an amount, etc.  Someone else would have to buy them for me and I'd basically have to pay them back.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:29:15
I bought a cheap laptop from computerrefurb.com, installed ubuntu and electrum.  I'm pretty happy.

@_date: 2014-07-04 21:09:22
Thats ok because I KNOW who you are.  You're an assclown that wants to stop the adoption of bitcoin.
Anyone telling folks to shut up about bitcoin can kiss my ass personally.  I've read PLENTY about marketing and you know what you have to do to get the word out.  You have TO GET THE FUCKING WORD OUT...nimrod.

My takeaway:
Don't go flashing your privates in public.
@_date: 2014-07-21 13:27:04
Jailing people is evil.  I'm sorry but I want heads.
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:16:58
No this is called adoption.   People are interested.  Help them.
@_date: 2014-07-07 22:00:08
It's amazing that he can SEE that the central banks are the absolute ponzi scheme yet he criticizes a currency that is fixed/scheduled in inflation, where anyone can compete to make new units and where if you have a ton, once you spend it it is gone and you can't go back and simply print more.
@_date: 2014-07-19 23:14:28
Ok.  I'm confused on what snapcards has to do with it.  Do I use snapcards to buy the Food Lion gift cards?
@_date: 2014-07-20 21:35:17
I know, it's not Amazon.com or Walmart right.  How many lines in the sand will you draw and expect bitcoin to cross before you'll fight PUSSY.
Bet you never thought Dell would accept bitcoin, let alone call other merchants idiots for not doing the same.
@_date: 2014-07-21 13:26:26
If it's just tolerable enough, maybe it won't be fought as hard.  I dunno.
@_date: 2014-07-15 19:32:06
Nevermind.  I don't have to do that with US dollars.  I'll just stick to paying with US dollars.  Can you comprehend that message?
@_date: 2014-07-13 15:11:39
This guy is AGAINST bitcoin.  He'll deny it even when it's spread over the entire world and each btc is worth 1 million.  
Some people just don't understand the fluid nature of the currency and just how fucking easy it is for this to happen.
@_date: 2014-07-21 02:24:19
There is no difference.  Bitcoin is an accounting ledger...lol.

The having a calculator part needs to get automated for people as much as possible over time.

I believe through Coinbase you can instantly purchase as soon as you buy.
@_date: 2014-07-20 21:33:27
So, why is that any different?  
@_date: 2014-07-20 17:08:46


Might big britches he has calling Dell gullible.
@_date: 2014-07-10 12:41:42
In the end, I believe this is exactly what slows human progress--not just bitcoin.  You're exactly right.  I do it.  You do it.  The guys selling cigarettes do it.

Someone with a great ability to write and document should record all of Lawsky's actions and see what special interest group(s) they can be traced back to. 
The public doesn't care but it should be recorded and investigated for history.
In all honesty, in 10 to 20 years, when bitcoin has won, there should be consequences (real consequences) to this bullying(violence).  No one should forget.
@_date: 2014-07-20 21:32:59
Here's one guy.
@_date: 2014-07-12 00:26:01
The bitcoin foundation and the way the core programmers are paid is why people will switch to other currencies.  That's the bottom line. 
We need to change how the core coders get paid.  Gavin is still promoting the bitcoin foundation.  This is very sad.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:07:07
I'm hoping someone with a better understanding can tell me.  :)
@_date: 2014-07-10 04:35:07
Gavin Andresen's acceptance of the shit that the bitcoin foundation has become is really, really disturbing.
If the bitcoin world stops trusting the core developers, there will be problems.
@_date: 2014-07-22 05:34:07
Define regulation.
@_date: 2014-07-21 13:30:55
Don't worry, if these regulations spread, there won't be a need for an because bitcoin will never be used.
@_date: 2014-07-21 17:37:38
So I provided you what you wanted and this is your response.  A black Friday sale is TOTALLY different as it is ANY payment method not one specifically.  So if this guy had a black Friday sale at 50% then bitcoin would have had fucking 80% off.  
Go fuck yourself.  Keep drawing lines in the sand and keep watching bitcoin cross them calling you a pussy and daring you to fight.
@_date: 2014-07-19 23:14:00
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:17:24
Looky here...someone that doesn't want to see bitcoin succeed.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:06:26
You got me.  I just noticed the coin.  Maybe it's bogus.  I believe there is a pdf on their website.
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:34:04
Bitcoin hater!
@_date: 2014-07-05 15:38:20
@_date: 2014-07-20 21:28:30
I can GUARANTEE you Dell is holding a percentage of bitcon.  Any company not doing that now is fucking stupid.  All bright people hedge their bets either way.
If you can't understand that, you're a god damn moron.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:10:51
So it's likely just bs pumping?
