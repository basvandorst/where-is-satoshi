And I'd like to offer you $1 for 1 bitcoin, but those things aren't of proportionate value either.

Yeah, true.
Either way, I won't log in until I get some sort of confirmation that everything's fine.

What do you mean the can't make money from it?
They can charge fees for converting to and from Bitcoins (certainly from, not sure if they'll also be selling them to us), much like other exchange services do.
The have the same opportunity to make money off of transaction fees as they do on every other transaction done through PayPal...

It's back up but DO NOT LOG IN.
I don't know if mobile users will get it, but on PC I got a popup message telling of a potentially malicious javascript message, and that I should not log in, until further notice.

Got a popup message saying NOT to log in, due to a potentially malicious Javascript error!
@_date: 2013-06-01 03:59:37
That'd be cool.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:47:12
So.. what you're saying is.. don't log in?

In the UK, Bristol has it's own Bristol Pound, that has a 1:1 constant exchange rate to GBP, and was made to encourage shops to use local suppliers.
I don't really see the point.

Yeah, most people can't see a price in BTC and immediately know how much that is, which is why I added:


Bitcoins can **only** be used as a currency if they are stable enough that someone can go "Oh, that looks like it's worth about 2BTC, and that about 1.5BTC". I agree, having read various posts this evening, that Bitcoins should be seen more as a means of exchange, not a currency.

No, he cancelled it/it got rejected because he most likely doesn't have that much to give and doesn't want to give it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:02:41
Wait, so if I'm using the Blockchain Chrome plugin, I should be good to log in?
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:49:48
What Bitcoin needs is to be accepted as a legitimate currency, so we don't have to rely on exchange to USD or EUR for everything.
Obviously this in itself requires stabilisation of the exchange rate, but lots of people don't want that, as they see BTC as a way of making money as it rises and falls.

[Here]( is a post made by someone getting the same thing.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:03:32
Yup, can't connect either.

Huh, I guess it never caught on then. Interesting.
