Interesting that Coinbase is now in the position where you have to defend your financial status.
Obviously mistakes have been made, otherwise there would be no need for it.
The issue with making this statement is that you're unlikely to prove it. Customers just need to trust you [*cough*].
... and just the opposite outcome is likely. Making the statement without proof foments distrust.

Regardless of coded behavior, I presume Bitfinex would be one of BitGo's largest customers (with a unique setup apparently) and they obviously didn't even audit BFX security settings.
Even my shitty ISP emails me warnings when i reach 50% bandwidth allowance. BFX get no warnings or throttling of outgoing funds?
This is a flaw with BitGo security practices. 
Nothing to do with multisig.

My expectation is that exchanges should transfer fiat within 48 hours and bitcoin within 1 or 2 hours. 
However, this is an issue of poor customer service and communication. I've read that iGot have been having problems lately, so I'm guessing OP has been affected by that.

For example, let's say Western Union open a payment channel to transfer funds between their world-wide branches; do they just setup one channel that's open *forever* (and therefore only costs a few cents - ever) or are these channels popping in and out frequently?

The best explanation I've heard about price dropping when there is news about new large merchants accepting bitcoin:
Large merchants create sell pressure when they convert all bitcoin income into USD.

The ruling could have been far worse. Although the "double tax" is frustrating, it's by no means death or force companies offshore. It just makes bitcoin a bit more expensive in some situations.

I disagree. You've put Bitcoin into the 'currency only' box. It is far more than that, which you touched on with asset transfer. In fact, let's call the blockchain an asset register.
Any asset, such as property, shares, wills, settlements, etc **might in future** use the Bitcoin network to facilitate verified transfer of asset ownership. 
Even if the system that does this is a sidechain, or altcoin or other type of blockchain technology, there is a likelihood that Bitcoin's coins (or slots in the register) would be pegged to other virtual assets that are transferred. Those bitcoin slots (ala parcels of land) would be a very hot property.

Let's say I purchased 1 Bitcoin at $200 in October 2013.
December rolls around and I have my eye on a new smartphone. Bitcoin is valued at $1000.
In my mind, I have $800 of free money. I am now FAR more likely to spend $800 on something I want to buy, and still have the value of my original investment in my pocket.
On the other hand, if I had to toil away at my job to earn $800, I'd be thinking long and hard on whether I should buy that phone or keep saving the $ for a rainy day.

I've seen many people refer to this flashcrash on MtGox as a crash in Bitcoin value. The cause of this crash was a HACK - Not because the market decided to sell all bitcoins.

One thing I've learned about banks is this. When you deposit YOUR money into THEIR bank, it becomes THEIR money. Ownership of those notes and coins have changed hands. You gave it to them and they will decide whether they feel like giving it back to you.

I calculate Overstock.com have saved themselves $12,860+ in fees by integrating Bitcoin payments.
**1% (coinbase fee) vs. ~ 2.2% plus $0.20 for credit card card transactions**
1.2% of $1,000,000 + $0.20 x 4300 orders
= $12860 saved in 50 days
7.2 x $12860 = **estimated $92,592 per year saved** if data stays on par

Don't forget the current "dust" threshold of 5300 Satoshis. Also miner's fees. Sending less than 5300 satoshis will cause most miners to reject the transaction, regardless of fee.
So "zero impact" on value is unlikely. There will be value pumped into Bitcoin through the use of asset registry.

Sorry if this sounds pessimistic but let's look at it from the countries government's point of view.
Why, in their right mind, would a government give up the opportunity to control their money supply, peoples wealth and resources to a decentralised currency they have no influence over?
How could this country fund wars and suppress their citizens if they cant print their own money at will?
This government, if Bitcoin becomes a reserve currency, would have had NO choice in the matter. The citizens would make Bitcoin their own choice of acceptable money and become the norm and the gov can go f themselves.

I have wondered about this as well. 
Even if you make multiple copies of your wallet.dat file on several USBs today (for redundancy), all those devices could be faulty after 10 years. Same goes for CDs, Harddrives.
Cold storage backup strategy should not be 'set and forget', but rather 'set and revisit once a year'.
So, I think it may be smart to 'backup your backups' every year or two. Just to make sure the **devices** will continue to function, as well as checking to make sure the latest version of your **bitcoin wallet** is still compatible (should be, but who knows).
But remember, as soon as you add keys or make transactions from cold storage, you should sweep funds into a new wallet/privkey and make full backups again.
Edit: with each backup, I also backup an install copy of the bitcoin wallet software (ie bitcoin-qt)

These big price run ups in April and Nov brought a lot of attention to Bitcoin from mainstream media and introduced high net worth individuals to cryptocurrency. Needless to say, if this report has any truth to it (and I believe it has a lot!), the underhanded way Bitcoin has received this attention is absolutely horrific, but let's look at the silver lining.

Possibly the downvoting is from calling dogecoin an asset. Inflation and monetary debasement is built right into the code, thereby making it a liability to hold for the longterm.

The general public or average bitcoin investor cannot be educated so easily. I think the problem is at the exchanges, and perhaps they are the cause of most issues (rumors, hacking, incompetent or malicious management). The sooner we get decentralized exchange mainstream (open transactions, pegged side chains,etc), the better. The old skool exchange should become fiat exchangers, not trading platforms.

There is a time lock function in the protocol. You'd need to keep the privkey from the moment the transaction is signed so that it can be used to spend after the time lock has expired.

You know what i find more concerning than hitting the blocksize limit? The fact that Gavin has to spend so much time convincing non-devs that his strategy will turn out OK instead of actually GETTING SHIT DONE.

He's saying Bitcoin == Blockchain. The blockchain technology has been re-used hundreds (if not thousands) of times, but in every instance, the very nature of the Blockchain requires units of account in the ledger. The Blockchain and the unit of account cannot be separated.

Gavin is really campaigning for this change to block size. 
His arguments are very convincing. 
He's said he wants agreement before pushing the code, but ultimately he may have to 'pull rank' if he cant be convinced against raising block size. Seems he's pretty convinced though.
Sincere apologies. Gavin never said such a thing. I am 100% wrong.
I did try to find the quote, and believe this is what I was thinking of.
Question from audience: "If you had free reign to change bitcoin willy nilly..." (paraphrasing).
Gavin answers "no maximum block size - Satoshi made a mistake".

I, too, am concerned that this debate will cause toxic division between the core devs. Obviously it would be great if they could all work as one cohesive unit but it's just far more complex.
I was also in Gavin's camp a few weeks ago, but after educating myself more about both sides of the argument, i am on the fence.
Something does need to be done. I can't vote either way though...

Some Bitcoin facts that aren't facts:
1) "Bitcoin is a currency that can lose up to 80% of it's value in seconds". I suppose it "can", but has never happened. The US dollar has lost over 90% since it's introduction. Now that's a fact.
2) "Bitcoin is outlawed in many countries around the world". No, it's not.

This is 50X price increase between halvings. If we were to be pessimistic and say the next halving would result in half the increase, we're looking at 25X.

Satoshi is a denomination of an exact value ( 1/100,000,000 BTC), so if more decimal places are added in future, there will be a new "smallest possible part".

Bruce, I have a huge amount of respect for yourself and appreciate the good things that the foundation have done in the past, including lobbying efforts and representing bitcoins best interests during senate inquiries, paying devs and holding conferences.
... and then there's the (jailable) bad stuff. 
I observe you frequently distance yourself from the "old management", but there is no denying that in the eyes of the public and media The Bitcoin Foundation is The Bitcoin Foundation. The skin of the old entity is the same as the new even if the muscles and bones inside have changed.
I believe the reason you'll hear many asking you to shut down the Foundation is because the stench of tainted rotting flesh will continue to smell until the corpse is buried. (apologies for the imagery)
"The Bitcoin Foundation" does **not** have such a good reputation to justify hanging on to the name.

I couldnt agree more. At this point, Core has **everyone's** attention. If they were to say 'We will hard fork, but **everyone** must follow our instructions and timeline', I think the entire ecosystem will jump into action and make a Core hardfork to 2Mb a success.

What you may perceive to be irrational behavour could simply be one man's goals misaligned to your own.
For example, let's say Jihan's personal goal is to earn $100 million (or Yuan equiv) and he wants to do this before he turns 40. One option for him is to corner the market and extract as much as he can as fast as he can. 
He doesnt care about the system, only lining his pockets. Once he reaches his personal goal, he couldnt give a shit about the system. He has his bling.

Title should read **Drama Queen** Mike Hearn is **Butthurt**
So now that he's working for a bitcoin-competitor (R3), he's poo-pooing bitcoin. Conflict of interest much?
Mike believes Bitcoin has failed yet shows evidence of transaction growth and network usage! He truly has his very own reality distortion field.
There's also a hint of racism saying the network is controlled by just 2 miner - oh wait, **Chinese** miners. 
Here's my take - Mike **created** this block size debate in the open by pushing XT and now that the controversy has split the community, he's criticizing the split (that he and Theymos caused) and talking down to the community who supported him (and those who dont). **What an asshole.**
Despite my opinion about his personality, I recognise the good work he's done for Bitcoin in the early days. Respect. Good bye.

For me, I first heard about Bitcoin when credit card networks and paypal blocked Wikileaks from using their services. This was end of 2010 I think. So, Wikileaks solution was to accept Bitcoin and I thought it was absolutely weird (but interesting) that they would accept virtual currency.
About a year later, I educated myself about bitcoin and fell down the rabbit hole.

A general rule is: "If you dont own the private keys, it's not your bitcoin".
Keeping funds on Coinbase or any 3rd party system (including exchanges) has the risk of the company disappearing, stealing or losing your bitcoin.
So it's better to keep long-term holdings on a hardware wallet or paper wallets.
It's fine to keep 'spending money' on your phone or Shift card.

Full blocks are vivid evidence that adoption of Bitcoin, as a network, has not peaked yet. Once higher transaction capacity is realised with SegWit and LN, we'll see entirely new applications built on top of Bitcoin. This is where the huge potential lies.

1) Have to sell advertising or use Google Adsense.
2) Have to get huge traffic numbers (for the ad clicks) which contributes to high server resource use (bandwidth, disk space, etc).
3) Have to pay for servers, staff (eventually, presumably) after you've paid out bitcoin commissions.
The incentives are for users to upload a lot of low quality content just to get paid, while the rest of your site's fans who do upload high quality content have to wade through crap to enjoy the site.

Here's my FULL and COMPLETE solution. I had to do this myself just last week.
**BITCOIN CORE STAGE**
- Open Bitcoin Core and go to Help &gt; Debug &gt; Console
- If your wallet is encrypted, type: **walletpassphrase {password} 300**


- Type:  **listaddressgroupings** 


- Type: **listreceivedbyaddress 0 true**


- For **every** public address you've noted down, type: **dumpprivkey {address}**


**MULTIBIT STAGE**
- Open MultiBit and go to Tools &gt; Export Private Keys &gt; Export to ... &gt; then Export
- Open in Notepad (or similar) the multibit.key file you just saved.
- Add all your Bitcoin Core private keys into the file and make sure you preserve the date format. 


- Save the multibit.key file with your private keys inserted.
- In MultiBit, go to Tools &gt; Import Private Keys and do this for the file you just saved.
- Go to Tools &gt; Reset Blockchain and Transactions.
- Dont worry, be happy!

On the second point of giving away bitcoins, it's going to attract a very large proportion of leeches and gold diggers who's sole motivation is to SELL those bitcoins for fiat. 
99% of the rest of those bitcoin recipients will either lose them through lack of education, or leave them unused in a centralized wallet (ie changetip, coinbase), or care so little that they never think twice about abandoning their measly 10c worth.

Here's my use-case of a trader offering his services using the 21 Bitcoin Computer.
@_date: 2015-09-22 06:15:58
They want to buy your bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-23 01:05:00
Clearly, the job of this device is not **just** to mine bitcoin.
The **purpose** of the device is to make it easier for a person to buy or sell services for a fraction of a cent.
For example, let's say Mr Expert Trader offers a service. He offers his opinion on whether bitcoin price is about to go up, down or sideways within the next minute.
As a novice trader, I might appreciate this opinion and be willing to give 1 cent for it. I've programmed my 21 Bitcoin computer to talk to Mr Expert Trader's Bitcoin computer and execute a trade based on the data received.
Mr Expert Trader receives my 1 cent every minute. 0.60c/hour. He might have 1000 other "customers" and earns $600/hr (in bitcoin).
It is ONLY WITH BITCOIN that this scenario is possible.
To drive home this example, both myself and the expert trader could be sleeping while all this happens automatically. Mr Expert Trader has his analysis software and custom-algorithms to determine bitcoin price which automatically feeds in to his Bitcoin computer.

I listened to the interview. Olivier's two main ideas to further bitcoin adoption are:
* people go to every shop and convince the merchant to accept bitcoin, and
* you, me, everyone GIVE AWAY our bitcoins to people who may not care, in what he called a 'mass changetip event'.
I dont have any better ideas, but man, these are awful.
1) Who are these foot soldiers, in their tens of thousands around the world, going shop to shop, preaching bitcoins to merchants like religious fanatics?
2) I will NOT give away my bitcoin in the hope that some stranger maybe, possibly, will buy more on their own later down the track. My bitcoins are VALUABLE and excuse me if I'm a bit more sensitive about devaluing my investment by giving it away.

**Why Ethereum Isn't Exciting (yet)**
1. If Bitcoin could only be understood by the geeks (like me), then Ethereum is understood by a tiny subset of super-geeks (not like me - im not smart enough). Ethereum's audience is more limited than Bitcoin's - therefore less excitement.
2. Smart contracts don't seem to be sexy. It's very legalese and **sounds** dull (However, I'm interested in their potential. See 
3. Ethereum has no product to show (yet), but bitcoin does. So, let's wait and see what they can do.
4. Ethereum doesn't have a mysterious lore surrounding the system (ie, Satoshi) nor a philosophical stance (that I'm aware of). Bitcoin's story is more interesting (in my opinion).
Bitcoin's "change the world" attitude is super cool.

I thought this too, that Craig is trying to cast doubt that he is Satoshi, and put on this whole big circus to discredit himself - when he really is Satoshi....
... but Craig is the one who has been going around saying in private since (reportedly) 2005 that he is the creator of (a system like) Bitcoin.
So either Satoshi has multiple personality disorder, or Craig is someone who was working on similar ideas at the time and 'hijacked' Satoshi's Bitcoin, saying that Bitcoin was his idea and since Satoshi wants to be anon, he's happy to be Satoshi.
Kinda like Dread Pirate Roberts, Craig wants to take on that role.
EDIT: Just to clarify ... I think CSW was a member of team "Satoshi Nakamoto" (I think this is **most likely**).

Hey, could you do me a huge favour and ask your friends to record a group video of you all in the pub shouting "happy birthday bitcoin!" ?
China has had a big impact on bitcoin this year so it would be awesome for the birthday video im putting together for happybirthdaybitcoin.com
More info at the site

Speculation and prediction time. What events will drive new ATHs?

"You have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is."
Not to be ageist or anything, but I don't expect an 87 year old to understand anything about Bitcoin.

As I'm reading this long thread, the price has dropped from 205 to 175 in the space of 5 minutes. 
EDIT: ... and recovered just as quickly.
Now that's resilience! 
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:54:57
&lt;geek&gt; your advanced video got me very excited &lt;/geek&gt;
Keep up the good work! Freakin awesome OT
@_date: 2013-12-29 10:14:51
Love the idea but fees too high for me.

Australia's Coinjar is mentioned at 9 min mark. Getting international attention. Well done Ryan and Asher
@_date: 2013-08-16 13:45:04
Thanks. Integrated the site using their API for near-instant payouts.
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:16:50
I'll just add my +1 for this. Do it guys!
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:35:12
Calling Peter Schiff. Peter Schiff? You're next...

Bitcoin was born with the release of Satoshi's whitepaper on 1st Nov 2008. The first block could be considered Bitcoin's first step, but not it's birth.
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:42:47
I've been watching Litecoin's price increase and wondered whether I should buy in. Thank you Erik for slapping me across the face. Bitcoin all the way, man!
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:28:31
Awesome news. Congrats guys. Get those rocket boosters ready! 
@_date: 2013-08-19 12:31:18
I think the bitcoin community is much smaller than most realize. Really really far from mainstream. A good figure would be a count of nonzero addresses, as anenome5 suggests... And then cut that figure in half.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:34:52
Another great interview with Andreas. I gotta say, im a bit of a fanboy of Andreas.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:02:52
If Peter doesnt wake up soon, he'll simply be left behind. My hope is that he becomes a great vocal asset to promote bitcoin positively. His conversion to our cause would be one of those huge 'backflips' that get more mainstream media attention and he tends to get a lot of airtime already. C'mon Pete.
@_date: 2013-10-03 01:52:43
Have to admit it's pretty funny. The presentation, not the hack.
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:47:23
The guard dog makes sure ONLY people with bitcoins can enter.

Jeff is a core bitcoin developer. If any "crazy hacker" can send bitcoin into geosynchronous orbit, he can.
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:42:45
I agree. Looks like we have a new floor of $200 ±10%
@_date: 2013-10-20 00:09:23
Putting a date on milestones is important for broader understanding and promotion. We cant change bitcoins birthday, nor should we want to.
Self promo: this is my site showcasing bitcoins greatest milestones 
Im soliciting videos for a compilation to be released on bitcoins 5th bday. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:05:51
+1 Keep doing it. It's awesome to see the fluctuations in fastforward.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:33:54
15,000 bitcoins and counting ....
EDIT: 30,000 now and still plummeting 
@_date: 2013-10-07 00:57:05
You sir, are a beacon of positivity to both the bitcoin and reddit community. There is no other user who contributes so much useful commentary, all us other Redditers are put to shame. So I thank you. For yet another awesome comment.
@_date: 2013-11-03 07:11:05
@_date: 2013-10-31 10:47:29
Awesome. You can contact me through the site or here on reddit.

Look at the longterm. Im planning to hold/save/hoard my bitcoins until they appreciate to a point where I can pay off my debts or to buy nice things.
Eventually, my bitcoins will be re-introduced into the economy. I will not hold them forever.
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:25:18
It's amazing how quickly the network has grown this year, and next year will be another order of magnitude larger.
I remember someone on bitcointalk forum saying in April that the network will reach 8PH/s by end of the year. I thought he was crazy. Now it's 11PH/s.
It's likely to be 300PH/s by end of 2014 (I base this on sheer guesswork)
@_date: 2013-12-21 10:24:22
Andreas hits upon all the essential talking points in favour of Bitcoin. Any of the typical arguments against Bitcoin, he's got a thoroughly thought out and persuasive answer. He's a great asset. :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:38:23
Great job. Love it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:06:26
I'll give an upvote because I'm that guy today too.
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:17:35
You did a great job of pulling all that data together. This is a great article for newbies to get a deeper understanding of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-05 08:55:07
So keeping my coins in bitcoin-qt encytped and passworded is sufficient safety? Even on an online pc?
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:49:09
Why doesnt reddit have 'ignore user'?
@_date: 2013-11-02 06:02:47
Also, I'm still asking for "Happy Birthday Bitcoin" videos from random people to be compiled into a montage for the end of the year. 
Mad Bitcoins is on board and I've asked other well-known Bitcoin names to join in.
@_date: 2013-12-30 11:07:08
Theres no details about the melbourne conference like participants and speakers apart from "rumored" winklevoss. Which pretty much means 'we asked them but have not heard back'.
In other news, there's a rumor I'm Satoshi.

Brilliant service and hope 2014 is a screaming success for blockchain.info team.
@_date: 2013-10-12 05:25:14
There's not much agreement except that the genesis block represents Bitcoins birthday.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:44:08
Im holding longterm and being a true believer in bitcoins strengths and brilliance lets me sleep well at night and stay calm during times like today. Just looking at long term charts puts a big smile on my face!

Attempting to use humor to bridge the gap between Bitcoin and a mainstream audience.
Perhaps I should have prefaced this submission with [HUMOR]

The Coinjar team went to TechCrunch Disrupt. I'm guessing they'll be back early next week.
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:37:39
Awesome video. Is the voice over done by Adam B Levine from Lets Talk Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:50:21
I believe bittorrent is actually working on doing exactly this. Although the big content producers would not condone such activities, the bittorrent scheme would be aimed at indie producers.
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:16:22
So many inaccuracies. Its hardly informative to the general populous. Australia needs a proper "bitcoin expert".
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:28:01
I absolutely f love the Bitcoin community. Awesome job +!
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:31:37
TL;DW - It is possible that in the near future, autonomous vehicles, such as Google's self-driving car, will use Bitcoin to facilitate payment for taxi cab fares, road tollways and other integrations within the car industry.
The future scenario outlined in the video is not far fetched and could be a reality within 10 years.
@_date: 2013-10-30 05:36:20
If you really want to convey what Bitcoin is to someone who has never heard of it, it's not clever to use buzzwords or kitschy slogans like "cash 3.0" that dont explain anything.
Just say "Bitcoin is a new form of digital money that's used to pay for things online and in shops". 
That's how I explained it to my mother. Now she's aware.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:29:39
Approaching 600 right now. Amazing. Let's see if your $2000 prediction comes true next week (I doubt it though)
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:43:54
Bitcoin can replace the function of sim cards and how that will benefit consumers, carriers and phone manufacturers. Well worth the 4 minutes to watch
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:12:19
My first reaction. "The bank is called First Rust?"
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:05:30
Well, I'm long on bitcoin, so day-to-day fluctuations don't bother me.
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:31:51
Bitcoin facilitating freedom. I'm with you on that one.

I have zero confidence in BFL delivery predictions. Thats all it is. Its not a promise... although it should be.

@_date: 2013-12-09 07:51:22
Its good to see people get excited about Bitcoin. If its the price that excites them, so be it.
Noobs get excited by the price then learn about Bitcoins true potential as a platform. Baby steps
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:10:32
My mother-in-law lives in China. She says "Bitcoin is everywhere". (ie, advertised, talked about, etc)
Last year, I thought the best metric to gauge when Bitcoin hit the mainstream was when my mother asked me about it. That happened last month. Now the mother-in-law too.
Good time, my friends!
@_date: 2013-11-17 12:04:10
My eyes are permanently glued to the ZeroBlock app. Can you believe it; only 10 days ago, I took the first screenshot at 300. 5 days later at 400, then 4 days after that (today) at 500. ummm.. 3 days until 600 ?!
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:41:01
I gave that post an extra upvote for you. What a shame about the grinches that troll reddit.
@_date: 2013-09-14 06:52:42
I've been thinking about the future exchange rate when considering pre-ordering mining equipment. Does it really matter *when* it's received if you're going to hold BTC for a loooong time?
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:32:58
I whole heartedly agree with your assessment and subsequent suggestions for 1 bitcoin = 1,000,000 bits. 1 satoshi = 1 centbit
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:02:56
The products dont need the expense of adding qr code to packaging. You can ALREADY scan the item unique barcode using an app. Lets say You scan with the Target app even if you're in walmart. Target can then ship u the item. 
This scenario is already possible using Bitcoin or credit cards.
@_date: 2013-10-11 03:58:33
Sure, but the concept of bitcoin would have been conceived (thought up) long before the release of the whitepaper.
@_date: 2013-10-31 12:37:58

Everyone in first world countries use debit and credit cards which give users access to digital ones and zeros. Likewise, mortgages are ones and zeros in a computer. Savings, debt, stocks are all ones and zeros.
Honestly, i dont believe Bitcoin being digital is holding people back.
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:34:46
    These moves by the PBOC are to ensure that there are no "side channels" where wealth can leak out of China.
From a transactional point of view, a Chinese citizen paying RMB for bitcoins to a Chinese exchange still has those RMB sitting inside the walls of China. The wealth is not leaking outside of the country.
Perhaps the china.gov may prevent Chinese citizens from depositing RMB into foreign exchanges. Or am i missing something here?

Whenever someone says "the bitcoin", I just think they're stupid.
