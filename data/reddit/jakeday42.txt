In my experience, it's great as a hot wallet. I use it for daily spendings and a KeepKey for storing other Bitcoin
Also, I got another one cheap for review that I'm selling for cheap on openbazaar.  if you're interested.

I'll buy the hard cover when available!

I only posted it once and what's wrong about it? Also, you say "wrong" when you don't even know what symbol is being used.
@_date: 2014-05-01 10:27:52
I can understand that! However, it's been fairly accurate for me as I've been using it. I hope you check back with it and see for yourself. If anything needs to change or be added, please let me know!

This was the result of a lot of work put into a calculated prediction. The historical values are the same you'd see on other sites. Namely bitstamp and localbtc combined.

That's what the tag based search at the top is for. Is that not working for you?
@_date: 2015-08-03 22:18:16
Good point. I'll work on that!
@_date: 2015-08-03 02:14:20
How the process works for you guys. I've not done a ton of shopping with bitcoin, so I'm curious as to how easy the process I've put into place is. You can check it out without actually completing payment if you want to see it. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-08-03 10:29:14
Sure do!
@_date: 2015-08-03 10:40:42
Working on it!

Are you sure your Tyly Vu is charging it? During the update, it checks repeatedly to ensure it is still on the charger. If it happens to stop charging during that check, it will just reboot.
Also, video is uploading now. I'll share the link once it's done.

I'm about to post a video on updating the firmware and issues that may arise with how to get around them. I will share the link here over lunch today.
@_date: 2015-11-23 04:21:58
1. Yes, I believe that is from the newer firmware.
2. It could be due to the signal strength, yes. I would try in a place with better signal. Modem could also be bad. You can check this by factory resetting the modem, then going to config. When you get to the point of pressing the bitcoin button to toggle the modem, do so. If it powers up, your modem is still good (from what I can tell).
3. Yep, seems to be the case (bad pun?)
Let me know how it goes!

Any reason why MyCelium does not see the new change address?
@_date: 2015-03-01 15:29:40
I wouldn't rule it out! Right now we are focusing on getting more designs and finishing the ability to upload your own designs. We will look at adding support for more coins in the future, depending on how bitcoin sales go! Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2015-10-04 12:42:10
I will be answering that question in the video as well.
@_date: 2015-10-05 11:18:50
Replied to you on YT :)
@_date: 2015-10-04 21:07:52
I'll do another short video with a sample transaction here shortly.
@_date: 2015-11-20 17:04:24
I need to do some formatting in the video, so it will be after work tonight. Do you have another wireless charger to try? I know that coming from stock firmware to anything 1.1.1+, the device will shut off (or reboot) during the update leaving you in a weird state. Only way to fix it is to use a different charger. However, starting from 1.1.1 you can update without issue using the included charger. Note: this is all from my first hand experience!

That was what I was thinking, I had just never seen it take such a large chunk. Even when generating a new change address, it typically shows up in my hd wallet, which it has yet to do.

Video is uploading now!

Case's support is amazing! I've noticed with the devices that I used that upgrading from the original firmware is rather difficult. It took me many, many tries. In working with their team to go over the issues, they nailed it with 1.1.1+. Upgrading now is painless and causes zero problems. Note: they are currently on 1.1.2 from the last announcement, but 1.1.3 is the current "ready to release" version that I have on my Case, and it's fantastic!

Mine was still tied to my device after, so no it does not erase the data. Keep in mind that you WILL need to run through the config I show in the video if you factory reset your modem.
@_date: 2015-10-13 01:11:56
Yep, I received it and several others have as well. When I asked support, they told me that shipping was delayed due to wanting to update the firmware first to fix a few issues (such as slow transactions sometimes) and look into getting a better wireless charger. They are for real, and are just trying to get the best possible product out that they can.
@_date: 2015-10-08 00:44:26
Looks like my confusion is in how MyCelium is showing the details of the transaction. My wallet with them doesn't see the change address for some reason, which causes the transactions and balance to not show correctly.
@_date: 2015-10-03 22:02:27
I did the first two and will try the third. I'll mention all three in the video review. Thanks for the suggestions!
@_date: 2015-02-28 22:49:48
Yep, and we also don't charge shipping.
