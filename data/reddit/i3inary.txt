Bitcoin is really not about buying your starbucks faster or easier or getting government permission to use or winning public opinion...its about liberating the planet from a corrupted and obsolete financial system that is installed in developing countries and rapes them of their resources and enslaves them with debt.
This is simply a demonstration of how the blockchain technology can be used to create more sovereignty and freedom for humans free from coercive control.
As humans all through our existence we have been free to trade with each other and now we will be free to trade with each other globally without a dictator/gov or some out of control entity preventing people (with violent force) from making their own livelihoods.
Lets wake up humans, it is within our grasp now...don't sleep through it or get misdirected by the negative spam media machine.
Keep your eye on the ball!

We built it to help inspire humanity to steer away from a blackhole called centralized absolute power.
You are a bag of liquid crystal drugs get over it and start sharing Love with your work.

I guess fire is a bad idea too huh?  We should never use it.
We will release that code when you stop the government from using fire to kill people (bombs etc).
Technology is always a double edged sword...why all the sudden is it not ok to ensure a basic freedom like trading with it?
Shall we all stop using the internet too...cause that stuff already exists without a free market..

You are not thinking globally.  There are many countries with oppressive governments using force to stop people from trading freely.
Here is just one example of a not so obvious thing that you could have someone kidnap you at gunpoint and hold you for ransom for selling:
*In some parts of the world, notably the European Union, it is illegal to sell seeds of cultivars that are not listed as approved for sale.*
I will leave it to you to search for the more obvious oppressive governments *cough* *cough* big red for instance.

Happy to serve the freedom loving community.

So solve that part of the problem if you think it can be solved...or do you prefer everything on a silver platter for you to turn your nose up at?
The community is building the actual usable version as we speak so you can have your solution to this considered and implemented (the people involved are interested in building a better future).
Until you contribute a solution you are just whining and doing nothing...and at this point you are actually allowing it to happen as much as anyone since it is in your consciousness now.
@_date: 2014-04-29 21:50:11
You don't have a choice in what you are associated with when you are building something as ubiquitous as currency or a market...your not grasping the concepts here and your ignorance is just fueling your rambling mouth.
Troll on.

Alright that was my first tip and I'm addicted now.  
@_date: 2014-04-24 23:26:27
Unfortunately you are caught up in the old paradigm prison.  Soon it will sink in...but I don't have the energy or time to pull it off in these comments friend.
Just stay positive and wait for the epiphany and have gratitude for it when it happens.
@_date: 2014-04-29 20:38:25
Most important thing that can come of this is that consciousness is focused on free markets and how important they really are.  
The code will come.
@_date: 2014-05-10 07:00:23
It feels amazing to get a tip...this will spread very quickly.  Great idea guys.
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:54:21
Hell yeah.

Andreas comments here and sums up how we feel also:

One thing is that you will potentially have to pay for your identity handle since it will be put in the blockchain.  The amount would be less than a domain name...but you get it forever.
@_date: 2014-05-10 15:52:38
Thanks I will 
@_date: 2014-05-03 22:06:30
oh helll no.

Get a real moonshot with Bitcoin

Hell yes.
So good to hear from a fellow dino brother.

This illustrates our true intentions behind the project perfectly:
We are all on the same team against the dark forces of absolute power and coercive control over all of our sovereignty as humans.  We the people of the internet must unite to protect it.
If you received the signal get involved...this is just the beginning.
@_date: 2014-10-08 02:44:01
Don't be negative and ignorant...be nice and smart.
@_date: 2014-04-29 21:12:19
I didn't mean to ignore but your question is not relevant.
My point is there is nothing you can do to stop negative human intentions with technology unless you want to give up your freedom as a human and give absolute power over everyone to an entity...I highly discourage that approach.
Computer technology does not solve the problem you want to solve. Philosophy/spirituality/morality/Love is the game you are after.

Bitcoin + Burritos = Heaven
@_date: 2014-04-24 22:38:03
You must be in finance to have that kind of sad perspective...
1. Infrastructure schminfrastructure.  Most other countries have users coming online with cell phones so maybe I am missing something but that's all you need to handle bitcoin and now we can also run a decentralized marketplace from it also.
2. Reintroduce what who...where?  You own and control your bitcoin yourself (you are at no ones mercy to suck up just to get access to your resources)...you sell to who you want, what you want, when you want, where you want.
...you are just wrong &amp; negative...a really bad combo if you ask me.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:13:21
bummer...well here try this.

There is actually a pull request already in to update that

hmm if only a drone could deliver me tostadas...
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:09:50
le sigh...good luck with your methods.
@_date: 2015-07-27 23:49:47
You should not be asking what the benefit is of having decentralized access to that which is yours...you should ask the inverse to that question:
Why should I let a few centralized entities (known to be irresponsible and also known to be liars and thieves) have absolute control over that which I spend my life working for and collecting?
The concept of money which makes the world turn and is half of almost every single transaction is in the hands of a few, proven to be untrustworthy, parties...why would I continue to participate in that kind of rigged system when superior options exist.  This is what you need to sell me on not the other way around.
Call it an ark...or a hedge for those who are tired of history repeating itself and want to stop the groundhog day cycle of fiat that crushes lives and entire generations of wealth.

I might be a little biased but Airbitz is easier to use for the layperson than mycelium...also automatically backed up which is huge if you lose a phone...also 1 touch 2 factor. Throwing up the bit signal to for other ideas to include in presentation.

holy swiss cheesus that site seriously looks like a baby made it...sorry.
i mean really is this is face of bitcoin?...the landing video doesn't even work.
@_date: 2017-04-05 07:50:02
you have no idea what your talking about
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:17:34
i think you need more luck with your approach for a few reasons.
a little luck to not make a mistake...it is guaranteed to happen when a human is involved.
a little luck for not losing or damaging the paper in some kind of unexpected situation....accidents and life happens man.
a little luck for remembering to be very careful and write things down and store it again in a safe place if you ever change your master seed....or maybe even just adding another wallet.
a little luck for not overwhelming or scaring a beginner (for no good reason) who is most likely not very technical.
also your 24 words isn't going to preserve your transaction history and meta data that you might have spent a good deal of time curating...you know for accounting purposes.
