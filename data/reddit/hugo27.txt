Seems like MT.Gox was also using his bank account in Poland to some extend (what i can read out of this dropbox attachment)

That does not sound good:
the post on BITCOIN.de is wrong, the case is not handled by the Police in Bremen. The investigation is led by the LKA and StA in Berlin. This afternoon they will post something related to that publicly in the 	German Federal Gazette. As soon as it's available, we will notify you by email.
If this information is real, I am very much concerned since the whole Police Bremen/Bank Account story would be wrong then.

The reasons for closing our accounts initiated by big banks are now know to us, and in regards to the law very questionable. Our lawyers are working with full pressure on this issue. We assume to be actionable again very shortly, and resume all business activities in favor of all users very shortly. We will keep you posted

I am a German speaker, and just called the Kriminalpolizei Bremen to find out if they really locked down his polish account. I could not reach the person in charge for Internet fraud, but I will try again later today. I keep you all posted.
We all NEED to coordinate and make sure to get this thing rolling. It's an UNACCEPTABLE behavior of Mr. Hausdorf, he has around 2M Euros of people (12K of my money), and he doesn't even write an email to all affected users. We need to go and search for information, I am not accepting that anymore.
I will keep on calling the Kriminalpolizei and as soon as I have information, I'll post it here and maybe can suggest some follow-up steps.
