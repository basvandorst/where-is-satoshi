Citadels baby, citadels.

Buy from Crypto.com, trade on Kraken. Perfect setup.

Had 2, overrated. People always photographing it, taking selfies with it, asking you to race, asking you to rev the engine, expecting big tips for special parking privileges. Traded the first one for the second one and lost that one in 2009 when the economy crashed and don't want another except maybe symbolically. Just to say, aha! I got it back! Lol. Just ego I guess. Was fun pulling up to the grocery store with it though, people watching like how is he gonna get the groceries in...? Haha, good times.

To be fair, smoking meats and shooting guns all day does sound pretty freaking awesome...

Institutional adoption. Look at the massive buy orders coming in. Chase Bank, Retirement Funds, the big boys. Bitcoin has crossed a point on the radar that everyone was waiting for. Now the feeding frenzy is on.

I love this comment.

This is the best method anyway. At least you're gonna have some. Eventually, common people may not even be able to get it. Could be institutional investors only. Billionaires on magazine covers. "Meet the man that owns an entire bitcoin. His government considers him a national security risk." Lol.

Look at your savings. Got 1000? Drop 250 of it into Bitcoin. Got 10,000? Maybe drop 2000 into Bitcoin. Sitting on 400k? Fuck you. Lol, just kidding, then put 50k in and wait for it to drop 20%. When that happens, don't freak out, buy more. Other than that, maybe put a little in every paycheck regardless of price. This is called dollar cost averaging and will help keep your price per btc from being too expensive. Risk adverse or just get bored easily? remember this: you don't have to use it all the same way. Whaaaa...? Yeah. Hold some regardless of price, have some set to auto sell at a certain price (either take profit or stop loss or both), use some to day trade during this volatility. It's not black or white. Have fun with it and make money!

I don't get all the retarded comments in this thread. "OMG, you hung 3 btc on the wall?!!! Someone's gonna break in and take it!!!" Lol. Jesus. Is that what 3 btc looks like? Then how does it get into to an exchange for day trading? Do you crinkle it into a little ball and force it through the fucking port in the back of your computer while connected to your exchange?
It's  a fucking picture of an imaginary bitcoin note. There are no real bitcoin notes. There are no bitcoin banks with bitcoin vaults stacked to the ceiling with these. This guy designed this himself. It's art. It's just a pretty picture that says, "Hey wouldn't it be cool if there was an actual physical currency backed by bitcoin? Here's an artist's rendition of what that might look like." He could print another one with 20 bitcoin for just the cost of printing. He could do a run and cover the wall with them.
Then you might say, "Well, maybe he put the keys to the bitcoin in the picture, then he's hanging a Lamborghini on the wall!!!" Hahaha. Really?  :/  The keys are not on the picture because it is just a work of art, like a cool t-shirt. It has nothing to do with actual currency, because, in case you haven't noticed, bitcoin is just an alphanumeric string. He could actually have it memorized, so it doesn't exist anywhere in recorded form. That's the beauty of btc. 
So, for now, just sit back and enjoy the pretty picture that has nothing whatsoever to do with how much bitcoin someone owns.

Institutional investors are getting in the game. It's becoming public knowledge. Follow the leader is reaching critical mass.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:19:24
Buy crypto from Crypto.com and get the actual price for real btc.
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:33:03
Crypto.com (they have an app by the same name) is the best. Easy to get verified. Actual bitcoin prices - not marked up 20%, works like a dream. Best by far.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:48:19
HODL Bitcoin, day trade shit coins. Win/win.

Clever comment.

Just about there!

The right way would be to have a stop loss at no more than 10% drop from where it is. Pull the cash out, wait for it to drop, then take all the sweet cash to buy way more btc at the cheap price - also with a stop loss in place. People need to be more strategic.
