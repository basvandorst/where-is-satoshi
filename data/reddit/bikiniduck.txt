On the checkout page, as an option, next to paypal and credit cards. 
Where else should I mention it? Where were you looking for it when you visited the site?
@_date: 2014-09-12 04:14:40
Is there a list of these lists?

Where would you want it mentioned? In what section would you be looking for it? Its an option given on the checkout page.

On average it's around $500 a month in retail sales on the website, along with ~$200/mo in wholesale sales. 80/20 split Paypal/credit card.
Won't get me rich, but it pays for the DSL &amp; beer.

hacky sack is trademarked by like Mattel or someone. Footbag is the generic term.

Valid points. But step back, zoom out, and ponder it some. Just because *you* think a niche has no potential, does not mean you are correct. I refute your point purely with experience. I have been making and selling these online for 10+ years now. I've sold *thousands* of them so far. 
People do buy them, and they do like them.
The first time I posted about them in I sold over $1000 worth of hackys in one day, just in BTC! I was ecstatic, this was proof to me that this was real, *people do use btc after all!*. But after that initial rush, nada :/ 
So people do like my shit. And this post is me asking how can I get more people to also like my shit.
Given the options on checkout of credit card, paypal, or bitcoin; nobody ever goes for the bitcoin option.

Lets see how long it stays up. 
ScamCoin fluctuates so much during the day there is no way a retailer can set prices. Having to change the prices every 5 minutes should be fun.

Simple. They are taking electricity, and converting it to random gibberish text. That bitcoin is now worth at minimum what they spent in power to "mine" it. Otherwise they are wasting money on their electric bill.

But dollars dont fluctuate from $12 one day to $35 the next, to $5 the day after.

Thats an alternative use. So far I have yet to meet someone willing to pay that much for a scourer.

Well they cant dump that many coins at once without killing the price. They have to do it gradually. 
As they dump they still need to keep pumping, to keep the price steady or rising.

I just went an added a link to it.

We wont be able to grow as much food as we do now due to energy/chemicals/weather.
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:18:37
I am implying that they are pumping up the price, so they can sell their holdings and exit at a profit.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:34:29
It needs to go negative...
Just because its less positive doesn't mean its a good thing, yet.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:01:06
They are, I just updated it with links. They weren't showing up earlier.

I am open to ideas. I have a shopify store I want to move all this stuff to, but I lack the programing skills to make it all work :/
Yeah, it looks like shit, but it works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
