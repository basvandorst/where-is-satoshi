Because it goes against the jerk.

No, the smartest way to show your displeasure in a company is spending your money buying products from them and uploading youtube videos of yourself destroying said products.

But you won't.

Hey, he can't type it all out because he's a busy guy.  He's got a failing business to take care of.

Ok, so an echo chamber it is, then.

My credit card has no annual fee and I pay it off regularly so that I don't carry a balance.  Whatever merchant fees the sellers pass on to their goods would be there whether I paid with cash, Visa or BTC.

Holy fuck, you actually just typed "do some red pill talk."
I'd pay money (like, actual cash-money) to listen to the transcript of you fumbling through your red pill talk while the woman at the other end of the phone gave you one syllable answers, waiting for you to tucker yourself out.

 Holy shit, Bitcoiners.  Never stop being this stupid, please.
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:12:24
I use my credit card when I don't have cash. It's really fast.

Never before has news affected me so little.

Holy shit, you sound like a petulant little kid. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:11:46
Edgy opinions.

I just checked with my bank and I still have all of my money accounted for.  Actually, this has never happened with my bank. Weird.

Whoa, awesome. What does Evander Holyfield think about bitcoin? How about Britney Spears? Dr. Phil?
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:03:51
Downvote me all you want, losers.
I mean that in its literal sense. You all lost money and it's hilarious.
