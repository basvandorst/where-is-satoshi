Hey Isaac, 
The Security PIN option in Settings protects all wallet features that can be used to send out funds, access keys, or pair the wallet.

We should be able to get it up on the App Store when it's out of beta, which will hopefully be soon!

Simon from Jaxx here. We do indeed have iOS versions! Because Apple doesn't allow beta products on the Apple Store, you have to request a beta copy through HockeyApp. We still have slots open for iOS beta users - you can sign up through [jaxx.io](

Hey there, Simon from Jaxx here. Could you send us an email at info with more info about your device to see if we can get you set up? Thanks!

We have adjusted fees in the past and likely will again.

Hey cbutler, could you tell us more about what happened there? Have you already contacted us and/or ShapeShift?
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:11:06
I assure you that quite a few people like it. :)
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:46:00
Thanks for the props cianuro! We're quite taken with it ourselves. :)

Are the transaction details unchanged after a Cache Reset (see Settings)?
@_date: 2016-06-28 13:15:21
You've got email. :)

Not sure. The transaction must have failed, but it was only caught on reset. Probably the BTC would have returned and the transaction cleared on its own given a little longer.

We are not using fee estimation as we do not have trustworthy estimation services that can agree on rates. If you have an idea of one we could use, we're all ears!

We'll be deciding on an open source license soon. More info here: 
@_date: 2016-02-27 01:04:59
We plan to select a repository on or before the 7th, but you should be aware that being able to inspect an app's code on (i.e.) GitHub is not a perfect solution for trusting software. For instance, when we upload our Android app to the Play store, the sha1sum of our apk file that we upload and the version that Google has available for download are different thanks to the alterations made on Google's end, so there is no method to directly prove that the APK file you end up with is the same file we uploaded. For what it's worth, we hope the reputation of our existing slate of apps (RushWallet, the Kryptokit extension, etc.) will attest to the fact that our policy to never even have access to users' security information (including private keys) has been honored.

Hey, Simon from Jaxx here. We are currently determining the appropriate open source license and will announce the chosen license by March 7th. 
In the meantime, if you have the Chrome extension, you can right-click to Inspect the code, or read the contents of the Firefox Nightly .xpi. All versions of Jaxx have the same codebase to ensure that they'll work together.

Thanks, AdvocateLLC!

Technically they're incorrect - we don't have a formal open source license at this time. However, Jaxx's code is viewable at
