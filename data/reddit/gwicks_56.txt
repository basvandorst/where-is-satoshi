Been a while since I ran it, but I think i just told it to try changing one letter out of my passoword ( ie each letter is changed 50 odd times for every letter on keyboard), then i had it add one letter on the beginning and end. Turned out I had left off the last letter.
Although I was using it on a wallet.dat file from Bitcoin core, not sure how it will work on Blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:06:00
Which seems likely. I am not OK with that. A tiny minority on both sides forcing us into a situation where bitcoin will split. I would prefer we stay exactly as we are.

I know UASF isn't a hard fork or PoW change. But per Luke-jr, if miners like Jihan decide to attack the UASF chain ( via mining empty blocks etc), luke says the response is a PoW hard fork.
Ergo, if Jihan attacks ( and his behavior up till now suggests he will), UASF is voting for a PoW HF.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:11:43
Less than 500 people in the community have signed the petition for UASF. How is that not a hostile takeover by a tiny minority that will split the chain?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:40:52
Nodes, slack channel, change.org petition. 
Look I want segwit and scaling, I think this compromise was executed so badly it never had a hope, but at the end of the day, I would prefer bitcoin have neither than risk a chain split. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:20:04
Good luck with your hostile take over
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:02:56
I think if they changed it to 12 months, I would be fine with it, and can't understand why anyone would not be. We will need 2MB eventually no matter how good side chains are, so why not just get agree and get segwit immediately. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:20:02
You talk about consensus, and then push UASF? As far as I can see, almost nobody wants it? Less than 500 people have signed the change.org petition. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:26:12
And if the miners fight it? You will be happy with a PoW HF? Do you actually own any bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:18:15
Turn against the users? The vast majority of users are either against UASF or don't care.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:16:55
Ok, someone mentioned 33% on the slack channel as well, so that sounds fine to me. My worries are more psychological than technical, in my experience people who have taken a position on something rarely back down, and are usually quite happy to cut off their noses to spite their faces.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:24:06
Except almost nobody wants UASF. Less than 500 people have signed the petition. I want Segwit, but not at the cost of a chain split and possible PoW HF. Either we compromise, or we stay exactly as we are now.

I used BTC quite a bit, and it always works, the problem I have repeatedly is the bitpay count down timer does not register the BTC payment. What i mean is, if you just leave the payment page counting down, it will count down to zero and say payment failed, but if you refresh the page a few minutes after making the payment, it confirms payment has been made.
Not super friendly, but I consistently save 20% on amazon purchases with Purse, so I will keep doing it. In fact, just bought a SP4, saved $200 by paying with BTC

Thanks! I run a full node, and have done for over 4 years, will add the BIP-148 comment soon!
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:22:26
How is a contentious UASF that will split the chain any better? Honest question.
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:29:42
1) As someone who has run a full node for 4 years, the storage issue is rubbish. If this where the only argument against a block size increase I would have no time for it. It is bandwidth and RAM requirements that are expensive, not storage. How long have you been running a full node for?
2) If miners attack BIP148 with a large amount of the Hash rate, a PoW HF will be necessary. The only reason anyone could be OK will that outcome is if they have very little skin in the game.
3) Also stating an opinion as a fact makes me think you are irrational, and not someone who should be taken seriously
4) Saying I am trying to destroy Bitcoin after having been involved for as long as I have been, and for the terrible sin of trying to understand the risk involved, make you either:
a) An idiot, or
b) A r/btc fanatic trying trying to cause trouble.
5) I, like most people with as much invested as me, want BTC to scale, with the least possible risks. At this point it seems more and more likely I will vote to keep bitcoin as is, no segwit and no big blocks, because people like you give every indication of being petulant children with no real idea what you are talking about. If you genuinely want segwit, may I suggest you refrain from commenting any more, as you just make it less likely to happen.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:41:24
Fair enough. My feeling is that Jihan is the type of person to cut of his nose to spite his face, and for that reason UASF is incredibly risky. Plus I was under the impression that a PoW HF was inevitable after UASF if miners mine empty blocks on the UASF chain.
If core updates bitcoin-qt with UASF I think it will work, but that doesn't seem likely, and 90% of bitcoiners don't read reddit, so I just can't see it getting enough support.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:29:50
I don't think Segwit is a hostile take over, I think UASF is. I want segwit. Like it or not, miners, wallets and exchanges are part of the ecosystem. I hate to use a cliche, but we rise together or fall apart. UASF is not going to have anything close to consensus, Jihan will attack the UASF chain, and all hell will break loose. The only way to prevent this is to:
a) Cross our fingers and hope Jihan plays nice, or
b) Prepare a PoW HF.
I cannot see how anybody would think that a PoW HF is safer than a compromise. Segwit now, 2MB HF in 12 months, locked in when Segwit activates. That just seems like the saftest option to me, that everyone should be able to live with.
I have trouble taking people who have been railing against a HF seriously, when they casually propose a PoW HF if UASF does not achieve consensus ( Which is what Luke-jr and the UASF slack channel are saying.)
Unless I am totally mistaken, and there is some way for UASF to avoid a PoW change, even in the event miners attack it. I would love to be wrong BTW.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:04:18
But UASF could cause a PoW hardfork if the miners attack ( if I understand correctly). So the choice becomes, which is more risky, 2MBSegwit HF or PoW HF? I take it as a given the miners will attack.
Understand I have no dog in this political fight, I have hodled for 4 years, and want to hodl for at least 4 more, all I am looking for is a way to scale with the least risks.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:24:56
I am assuming the safest thing for me do around the USAF activation period, is not spend or send any bitcoin. Correct? 90% my coins are in cold storage, the rest I use to buy stuff from amazon using purse.io. Do i need to do anything to keep my cold storage coins safe?

John the Ripper is good software, and I assume what most of them are using. I forgot my password a few years ago, but knew it had to be some combination of 10 or so words, ran it, and recovered my password in less than a day. You don't need much coding experience, but a basic knowledge of python will help.
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:08:04
You don't need to send the wallet. He can crack the password without access to you coins.

Nice work on the comprehensive privacy policy dude. I build Android apps for a living, and its one thing that is usually not done well, especially in crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:24:35
Money is supposed to be a store of value and a medium of exchange, but history has shown this is impossible. They need to be mostly seperated. So while Bitcoin can be used as a medium of exchange, it mostly won't be, because it would retard the economy. Bitcoin will be the ultimate store of value which other crypto's move into and out of, as they function as competing mediums of exchange ( with lesser store of value, value)

I would say, killing people for no other reason than their religion is wrong, regardless of who is proposing it.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:14:31
Except that's not true. Core, like most rational people, want segwit to be activated. It will not be. That is not "winning".
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:23:22
I think it is you who is missing the point entirely. Without a compromise Segwit will never be activated. So the choice is:
- Compromise, or
- Stay as we are forever.
Personally I would like segwit. I would also prefer no hardforks, I think they are dangerous. That said, I also think the toxic environment right now is perhaps even more dangerous, so I welcome threads like this to discuss options. I don't pretend to know the correct answer, and I say this as a professional software developer who is familiar with all the code, I am just getting sick of seeing the nutjobs from both sides treating this as a black/white, good/evil argument.

Comments like these are unhelpful and counter productive.

that's nonsensical. It's cheaper to pay with credit card, and you get the consumer protection services thrown in for free. I make small ( &lt;$100) btc purchases frequently because it doesn't matter if something goes wrong. I make large purchases with my credit card, because they offer more security and peace of mind to the consumer than btc does.
@_date: 2016-12-26 23:06:19
Both of those statements are true from a consumers perspective, which is all I care about. If you think otherwise you are deluded.

OP doesn't believe in jail though, it's just more theft. Interestingly he does not seem too hard to find though (seriously, you give a link to your facebook account dude? wtf?), so I guess when someone finds him, breaks his legs and steals his bitcoin, he will realise this is just the free market in action, and its his own fault for not hiring more mercs to protect him and his bitcoin. Taxation may be theft, but theft is theft too, and countries with taxation always seem to end up richer than those without it. 
OP, show some conviction in your bullshit....move to Mogadishu, not taxes there, might still be some theft though. But good theft, not that nasty tax theft.
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:06:40
I have done the same thing. I don't know how technical you are, but if you have some idea what the password is, a program called John The Ripper can get you in.
Basically it tries slight variations of what you think the password is, back on an old sandy bridge processor I checked about 5 combinations a second for about 3 mins, then it found my password for me.
