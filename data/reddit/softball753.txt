Crashed from what? It's value was always minuscule compared to BTC.

I've long been a fan of Apple products as well (I have a MBP and an iPhone 4S), but I would never trust a "closed" ecosystem like iOS with something as crucial as my Bitcoin Wallet.
Really, nothing with a "closed" ecosystem will ever be my main computing device, only an accessory. If you trust an e-wallet for holding small amounts of money, then that's your best bet.

Bitcoin is a distributed digital exchange medium that is also treated by many as a commodity. 
It can be used to transfer value: your money-&gt;bitcoin-&gt;transfer-&gt;bitcoin-&gt;their money. 
It can also be traded like a futures market. 
Not a scam because scams imply a (falsly) guaranteed investment return.

What do you mean by "actual value"? Nothing has "actual" value, it has intrinsic value or market value.
Bitcoin, like any other government currency, has no intrinsic value. It has market value (at least for the time being). Currently, its market value is due to two sources: speculation and exchangeability. People want BTC because they see a long term value increase relative to the USD, or they want them because they can exchange them relatively quickly for USD.
If you feel that 21mil is too low a quantity, then you might want to check out Litecoin. This has an 84mil total lifetime output and is intended by the creators to be a "silver to Bitcoin's gold", as it were.

You must not be familiar with Gizmodo or their previous coverage about Bitcoin.
Every article seethes with hatred. It's the same journalistic integrity that Fox News shows when they cover President Obama.
