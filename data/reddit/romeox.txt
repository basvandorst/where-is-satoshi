Thanks for the straightforward "yes" answer to my contrived scenario. My answer would be the same but I'm not comfortable with what that implies.
I believe we are both saying it doesn't matter whether the camp that seized control and banished the other is the 1% or the 99%. That means that "consensus" is simply whichever camp has the power to expel the other.  And even though I understand my logic that led me to this decision I am left uncomfortable with it - I am very much not a person who believes that might makes right.


The scenario I presented was contrived around that idea that staying on the old rule was impossible but unanimous agreement on a new rule was unreachable. The scenario resolves itself with overwhelming force. 


I'm not at the end of my thinking yet but the conclusion I'm heading towards is there is no such thing as "the consensus" but instead there are "the consensuses".  If the community splits over a fundamental question it isn't that one group or another left consensus, it is that consensus itself split into two.  If consensus splits in two then which coin is the "real" bitcoin? Which ship is the real ship of Theseus?
I see the appeal of the argument that whichever group stays on the pre-existing rules is the one with "true" consensus.  But taken to extreme that means a minority of only one person, if they had sufficient capability to resist, could claim to be the "true" consensus and block any change they disagreed with. And that idea I'm less comfortable with than might makes right.

Not to be sarcastic, but this sound a lot like traditional banking.  I don't want an exchange or a bank involved in touching my money.
LN is going to support a mesh of users with direct peer-to-peer routing, not force us to use exchanges.

Then please imagine this scenario...
A critical bug is found in the Satoshi reference client. The core developers cannot agree on the best way to fix it. They split into two equally sized factions and release two separate incompatible implementations.
There are now three clients - the Satoshi client with a critical bug, new client A, and new client B.  Which one is consensus?
Please don't say "that can never happen".  I'm really trying to get to the nature of "what is consensus" when unanimity ceases to exist.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:20:45
I thought about this but it is a slippery slope.
Does "general agreement" mean the majority?  Does it mean absolute unanimity? Does it mean some large percentage that isn't exactly 100%? How much agreement does it take to be "general"?

What was different in the housing bubble was that the financial system was offering loans to people that shouldn't have qualified specifically for the purpose of buying houses.
The situation will only be similar when large banks are offering $250,000 Bitcoin-purchase loans to people with 400 credit scores.
For bonus points the loans should be non-recourse backed only by the value of the Bitcoin, and then be securitized into tranches and sold as investment grade instruments.

Yeah, I *personally* agree with you, but you do understand there are people out there arguing that forks are taxable events?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:15:58
Tax attorneys and CPA have no other choice when giving advise on this topic unless they are planning to litigate the question with the consent of their client. Treating these forks as taxable distributions is the only interpretation consistent with the sparse IRS guidance on the topic.
Bitcoin Gold forked on October 24 and initially traded around $480 each. You paying taxes on this one?
Bitcoin Diamond forked on November 24 and initially traded around $60 each. You paying taxes on this one?
Seeing these events as taxable is the only possible advise directly consistent with the existing guidance. That doesn't mean that advise is consistent with other precedent or rulings.
Consider *Haverly v. United States* for example. This case is cited as precedent regarding the taxability of unsolicited income. But for a Bitcoin fork ask at what point "the taxpayer manifested an intent to accept the property or exercised 'complete dominion' over it"?  Accepting or exercising dominion over the received property is a crucial requirement of becoming liable for it.  This is true not only in case law but in IRS rulings.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:08:46
You are effectively saying "that can never happen". How would you determine consensus if it did?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:14:10
That isn't necessarily spoofing. Spoofing requires the intent to cancel before execution. Phrased differently, spoofing requires no intent to execute.
It is not spoofing if you place an order with the expectation that there is a 99% likelihood you will cancel it, but a 1% expectation it will be allowed it execute under a rare set of circumstances.
Spoofing is hard to prove. Doing so requires you look at all the trades of the spoofing party to understand their overall strategy, or have the source code to their algorithm.

That's an interesting observation. Have I constructed a gedankenexperiment that has no possible answer? That was not my intent, please allow me to try again.
Consensus resolution **within** the rules is trivial. It can be and is delegated to computers. Code is law. Consensus resolution **about** the rules is non-trivial. It requires humans. Humans are imperfect and subject to downfall.
You say my scenario is impossible so I will modify it.
A critical bug is found in the Satoshi reference client. It must be fixed by a clear deadline or the entire project will come to ruin.
Agreement as to the "correct" fix cannot be reached as the two emergent options have deep philosophical differences. The discussion solidifies irreconcilably into two camps. One camp is supported by the merest handful of developers, but among them are some of the most respected in the Bitcoin universe. The other camp has the unanimous support all other developers and persons of influence in the community. Many exchanges and miners do not take a position other than to say "the bug must be fixed".
The deadline approaching, at an impasse, desperate for action, one camp decides it must act unilaterally Their solution is pushed to the main branch on github. Their client is published on bitcoin.org. They revoke all administrative rights of the other camp to prevent their interference. The miners and exchanges unanimously and without hesitation spring into action and accept the change. The crisis has been averted and the project continues forward.
Has consensus been reached?
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:17:13
Please bear with me if you don't mind, I'd love to bounce my thoughts on *consensus* off someone else. I couldn't sleep last night with these thoughts in my head.


You and I agree that consensus means **unanimous** agreement among validators that the **rules** are being followed. It makes no sense to have partial agreement. Any validator that deviates from the majority of validators must be rejected.
Do you agree?
But that just led me to this thought...
Who decides what the rules are, and who decides when the rules can change?
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:28:59
To make sure I understand, I think you are saying "general agreement" equals "absolute unanimity".
That's a fine position, pretty much the same one I've come to, I just want to have precision in my thoughts.

Hey man, thanks for dropping in and shitting your ignorance all over the place.  Nothing better than watching someone go full retard.
Did you read OP's post?




OP was directly referencing the housing bubble, asset backed financing, and the systemic risk that it created for the economy as a whole.


Pay attention. The topic under discussion is not people defaulting on credit cards.  The topic under discussion is not people committing suicide.  The topic under discussion is systemic risk that threatens the economy as a whole.  I don't remember the federal government bailing out any banks because of Beanie Babies, do you?
Bitcoin could go to zero tomorrow and stay there forever and it would be of no great impact.  JPMorgan Chase wouldn't go bankrupt, the federal government wouldn't default on loans, wars wouldn't be started, and elections wouldn't swing on resolution. The news media would blink and move on to the next shiny thing.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:25:25
I don't understand the seeming cynicism you have towards my post.  I'm fairly new to bitcoin and I know there was a schism I partially understand, but I'm not asking about BCH.


This seems like another way of saying "the miners decide" - except it is profitability that drives the decision.
So what if the core developers create a fork and the miners find it more profitable to stay behind - in that case which one is "Bitcoin"?
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:29:55
If a popular but non unanimous fork happened who gets to say which one is "Bitcoin"?
If the Bitcoin Core developers created a fork but none of the miners switched, which one would be "Bitcoin"?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:17:46


I did a fork from core BTC last week and only told a few friends. Anybody who was holding BTC on the core blockchain when I forked now has an equal number of RomeoCoins on my new blockchain.
A friend of mine wanted to buy one of my RomeoCoins so we set up an exchange.  He paid me $100 for .000001 RomeoCoins, which established a market value of $100,000,000 per RomeoCoin.
Guess what, you all owe taxes up the ass on your RomeoCoins!  Bwa-haha-ha!
The Forbes article is not tax advice from the IRS. It is one author's qualified opinion. The IRS does not have a handle on this at all and notice 2014-21 is not keeping up with reality.  Calling bitcoins "property" in 2014 was reasonable but the technology has rocketed ahead since then.
If someone you don't give a shit about creates a fork that you don't give a damn about and starts trading their forked shitcoin on an exchange you don't give a crap about, that is supposed to trigger a taxable event?  If it is that easy then the government itself could start creating forks to force tax revenue on demand.

I would love to continue this conversation but I need to start the morning routine.
Thoughts about consensus have filled my head for several days, debate and discussion would help validate or disprove them.
Maybe I will return later, or start a new thread.

It isn't bias, it is pointing out that history shows that catastrophic bubbles bring their own source of liquidity with them.
So what if people are using their credit cards to buy bitcoin?  They could also use them to buy beanie babies or MTG trading cards or gold bullion.  Credit cards are a funding source that are exogenous to bitcoin investing.
The Dot-Com bubble brought with it the introduction of online brokers. This gave "average americans" their first introduction to online stock trading and brought them margin debt. The dot-com bubble was fueled by margin debt.  In other words, it was self-funding.
The housing bubble similarly fueled by NINJA loans and collateralized debt obligations. The mortgage market and the housing market created a cycle where each successive wave of loans was being justified by the previous wave of housing appreciation. In other words, it too was self-funding.
The education pricing bubble is being driven by student loan availability (and the non-availability of debt discharge).  Another self-funding bubble.
1980s Japan real estate bubble was self-funded by BoJ loan policies.
1929 stock market bubble was self-funded on margin loan.
1720s Mississippi bubble...
1700s South Sea bubble...
I could go on, but my point is that serious bubbles that caused economic damage are driven by some sort of self-funding mechanism.
If you want to make a parallel to Bitcoin then there needs to be some sort of mechanism available to the public at large where they can buy bitcoin for cash, and then put that bitcoin up as collateral to borrow money to buy more bitcoin.  I don't see it yet - except at the very fringe.
Clarification: I'm not saying that BTC can't be a bubble.  I'm saying it can't be a bubble that threatens economic crisis without leverage.

What does **consensus** mean to you?
I thought I knew what it meant to me, but the more I thought about it the more the concept became intangible.

Changing PoW isn't just about creating space between BtC and a competing coin. Changing PoW is also about making the current concentration of mining power worthless for BtC mining.  It is all specialized hardware that only can solve SHA-256.  BtC core moves to another PoW and suddenly that hardware has no relevance to BtC.
