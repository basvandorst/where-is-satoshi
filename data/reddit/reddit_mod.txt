Sorry i wasn't trying to pull you up on it or anything, i was just speaking generally in this case.
Other people elsewhere have stated strongly that some level of blame should be held with those users and i feel strongly that they aren't at fault for making those decisions.

It would be interesting to find out what their profits have actually been over the past few years and whether or not 'paying back investors fully' is even viable in the next 'x' number of years.
Are there any ideas/evidence out there as to how much in profits iFinex Inc. have actually made since it's inception, and what they can generate in a year?

Good point

It appears at the moment to be the best of a bad situation, i'm sure you can argue it's not legal and so forth, but if there is a legitimate chance that customers can be made whole again it's probably worth at least hearing them out first on how they propose to implement this. 
If BFX walked away or there was no genuine plan to return funds to it's users then sure at that point why not involve the lawyers/law enforcement..etc. the lawyers aren't going anywhere they'll always be a phone call away
Until then as long as we can see a clear way forward to repaying customers it's probably better to focus on this strategy, which if done right, can resolve this episode and we can all move on.

Ah i see what you mean. 
Well there are may people in this sector who do the aforementioned jobs and do have a large amount of funds held with exchanges for work related reason.
Also no-one outside of the exchanges with access to that kind of information really has any idea who holds what with them, so using $300,000 as an example may be high yes and the numbers aren't huge, sure, but not uncommon. The only reason why i'm not surprised by these amounts to begin with is down to knowing many traders myself and how much they have held at these exchanges.
The reason i mentioned it was because you do find people saying 'why have such large amounts held at an exchange', and the answer is put simply because it's there jobs to do so and it's rather unfair to 'blame' per say these individuals for doing what they need to do for their jobs. that's all.

Will the "shares of iFinex Inc.", be similar to 'MCXNOW Fee's' or 'RAWX Fee's' as they are now known? or are we talking about actual shares in the company?

By comparison it doesn't seem all that bad...

I think you've outlined the main points everyone has been reiterating since the latest update came out.
I agree with the points your making and it would be very interesting to get bfx's response on some of these points.
And yes it probably would be better to re-post this as a new topic or somewhere with more exposure.

Traders etc... are aware of offline wallets it's just not easy for them to use them and still be able to work doing what they do.
"Unless they comply with banking standards", I'm not sure i totally understand this statement or specifically what you mean by it.

I'm not sure i understand what your trying to say or the point your making, if you are making one.

Been around 10 hours and still nothing, started to worry a just a little bit so it's good to hear from someone who has had success. Thanks

All the other amounts shown are wrong as of right now, as well as the 'USD EQUIVALENT BALANCE' for some accounts, some users have reported, which are showing numbers that don't add up. So i'm assuming that number has to be wrong also. We'll know soon enough.
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:48:53
I think it was mentioned in here somewhere saying that they weren't compromised, could easily be wrong.
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:25:46
Or how price fluctuations have been reduced creating a more stable value

They were being processed manually, not sure if they still are hence the longer than normal withdrawal times

So no bank credit either? Does he just keep all his cash under his mattress?
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:00:59
Many people have to have that much on exchanges such as; Traders, Brokers and Market Makers among others who's full-time job it is to so.
There can be no blame reserved for those individuals.

Thanks Gavin I appreciate all the time your putting into this.

2) Are there any alt coins out there that interest you?why?
