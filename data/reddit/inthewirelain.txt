Eh I don't think Satoshi would mind the current state of things - to own a single mining machine and run it for a year, we're talking what, $50k tops? It's a lot more money than I've ever had but say it's the future and me and my family want to run our own miner for security reasons - maybe all coins are in circulation and people like us have to do this to make sure mining is still fair game. It is not tough to get enough people together to raise $50k.
I think BCH is the closest to Satoshi's vision of the two, no doubt, but they are both radically different. Even the first released version wouldn't work with BCH, nor would,d any node software going back a few years? 0.8 at least when there was a "hard fork". They are both very different. And SegWit is not the end of the world the same way p2h wasn't. I think it's unnecessarily complicated to suit the current set of issues, but it's a cool idea. I am of the opinion block size should have been raised, then we should have later looked onto lighting, segwit etc. I am not a massive fan of the incarnation that will reach the chain but I think had the BCH fork been BTC (minus difficulty), a years more development or even more could have made SegWit an amazing technology - and I don't think we should be afraid to hard fork in the name of progress. If it doesn't work, no one mines the chain.

There has to be a constant connection between the two nodes for the lightning link to be active. If the connection is dropped the channel is dropped and the funds are temporarily frozen or maybe permanently. Thus the implementation requires third party nodes to maintain connections to commerce for you. Their link won't drop, and if it does, they will arbitrate. Someone has to maintain the channel for you. If you open a channel, pay for a coffee, and close the channel, there is no benefit. You pay the same transaction fee as you would have on chain, high. It incentivises nodes to be always connected to merchants for you. You can't go down to your local store and keep a constant connection over a month, year, decade. Impossible.

Not true. If something amazing in computing happens with storage, RAM and connectivity, 2GB blocks would be Visa level IIRC (some blocks as small as 700MBish?). There will not *always* be backlog, when adoption gets to a certain point it has to be near instant.

I disagree they are bad actors but how is giving them 12.5BTC shaking them out?
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:09:56
Not true because it is by design decentralised. If it becomes centralised, the assumption is that everyone says fuck this and value plummets. I do not see how making decisions that obliviously centralise the market make gains in the long term. Saying we control BitCoin and then having control would make the value bottom out.

If 90% of miners dropped off, it'd take 2016 blocks to readjust to that. Given that it's about 1.4 days now, we're talking... 28 days with no difficulty adjustment? Imagine how full the mempool would get. The coin doesn't move without miners.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:36:45
It's a question on StackOverflow not an article. Look at the answers. The original poster also says:




Well, yes. A software update DID cause a hard fork, it was not on purpose, but it did - so it does on both counts.
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:59:42
That's not really it... Its because those services lock in a fiat value. The more BTC they sell off at once the less each is worth and their suppliers don't take BTC. A lot of big companies would love to properly support BTC but its not viable at their scale yet.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:10:43
I wasn't who you replied to by the way, but a single block by one miner put the chain into chaos for 6 hours. It caused two chains, one of which was soon abandoned. The data didn't change but the way it stored and locked was.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:07:13
It does in a way because you don't want to kill interest too early by making difficulty too high. No pools want to put 100% power into BCH yet.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:03:14

Not what I asked. Which coin currently in use is the "original" BitCoin?
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:14:14
No, there are little api changes needed. Everything happens behind the scenes. I am far from the biggest fan of segwit but this is honestly nothing to worry about. By design you do not have to change anything from a users point of view except change to a new address format (as in the hash/string itself).

In what way does BTC, BU, BTC1 or BCH contradict the PoW as defined in the paper and not the initial implementation? Other than SegWit, which turns a chain of signatures into a chain of links to signatures.

It *has* been available in some form on testnets for almost a year and is live in BitCoin. It is still worth waiting to see if someone found a hole and is waiting. Let's say an exchange move 20% pf their funds into a SegWit address, and a malicious actor waltzes in and steals the funds. Technically old nodes see segwit transaction as "anyone can spend", the Witness data is separated out of the block. It's possible a hole exists between the tested implementation and the adoption of the network at large. Imagine if the SegWit singling was fake for example. People singled ready for SegWit running non SegWit enabled clients.

Uh that is dependent on opinion. Old clients see segwit transactions as anyone can spend, the witness data is the trust in the chain of transactions. That should not be centralised.

@_date: 2017-08-25 20:07:24
And many others. I like BCH but I also accept that the bitcoin reference client initial release is not the same as either chain. There was even a "hard fork" in 0.8. In my opinion BTC becomes worthless when it can be printed past it's limit like gold would if it coated everything or came from a slow but infinite supply.

In what way is a patent not dangerous? Protecting your decentralised, trust through proof technology from being used by other people in a centralised, trust through reputation system if you would so choose? There is a reason Satoshi Nakamoto is not a figure head the community can turn to, or is on paper as being the person who created BTC. It's a lot of power. Imagine if Satoshi had patented Bitcoin. You don't have to be anonymous nor work for free but patents don't seem like the best answer to me in this space.

VISA level of transactions would need about 2GB blocks at peak size in holiday times, btw. Blocks go as low as I believe 700MB, even close to the average. In the decades it takes to become the dominant currency in every bodies life there will be advances in storage, in my opinion much larger than the rate of transaction growth. In 1991, 26 years ago, 40MB HDDs were cutting edge. A 1TB drive of 25,000 it's capacity (they are also much faster and more reliable) for about $50. The entire internet was around 45MB/s in 1991. Now in some countries that is $10-20 for 10x as much. It is not as big of a problem as you are making out.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:25:19

Take lower tx fees in hopes that if BTC goes fully mainstream you will process so much money it literally doesn't matter if they are $0.1 or $10m. The solution is baked in.


Also built in. Refuse to pay the fees until someone comes along willing to take your money to do their job.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:27:27
Well yes, you can centralise the smaller transactions through hubs. Not really being advertised at large though it seems it is what will happen, which could be good or bad. Time will tell. I know people hate PayPal with a passion, but for 99% of users, they experience little to no issues ever. Maybe BitPayPal will be OK too, although with its detractors who rather use BitStripe or BitWesternUnion....

@_date: 2017-08-25 19:02:18
What are you talking about? The payment systems we have now have low fees in comparison to BTC and back in the day it was basically free. What is happening is BTC is being changed from the white paper tagline of a "decentralised peer to peer cash system" into a "decentralised store of value with centralised daily transactions". BTC gets its value from speculation, potential, actual transactional value, marketing, scarcity (both now and long term - there will never be more than 21 BTC), etc.
You are equating physical items to services.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:08:32
And thus as a peer to peer system it should be correctly advertised as a service and not a function of the technology as it is explicitly off technology. It should not be used as a shield by Core.

Could you not argue trying to unite everyone would give an apolitical end goal?
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:27:38
No, it has to be defined in the transaction what will happen to the funds because in your scenario I am literally handing an IOU. That doesn't work in the real world, working capital is needed. You can open new channels but every time the channel is closed you pay full tx fees - so the very same connection has to unterminated and used more than once for a saving to be made. If you open 200 lightning network channels with walmart over a year, you pay 200 block fees, not one at the start and end of the month. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:51:18
Or in reverse: if it has more bugs, it is worse code.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:33:00
In which ways? I believe that this is how the long term markets will look. I think in 150 years when all coins ever have been mined, all 21 million, it will be used as a store of scarce value like gold for a long time but we will move onto system or crytpto x in 4017. I think as a project bitcoin should make itself as useful as a transfer of cash. The white paper literally is titled, "BitCoin: A peer to peer cash system". How can you really call it bitcoin if it isn't cash? Why isn't LiteCoin called BitCoinLite - it forked from its code.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:00:35
Doesn't scale in how long at 8MB block size and how do you know that it will not be feasible network wise by then? Do you realise how big 8MB is? You would in reality not get full 8MB blocks for years as these would need to be filled with tx data. You would get them occasionally maybe even daily, but the hope is you would get down right now to less than 1MB per block as the mempool fills so quickly on average and 1-2MB really in the next year or two, basically as much or more than SegWit allows for, never mind 2X.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:09:07
It's strange that there was a hypothetical attack in reverse for BCH. Mine empty blocks or premine and don't announce them to keep the network slow and manipulate difficulty. Especially as BCH can adjust difficulty every 12 hours vs 2016 blocks for BTC. That'd be every 1.4days by design for BTC, although as it requires a number of blocks and not a time, it is possible if everyone but one raspberry pi miner abandoned the network it might never move on. There is also the chance BTC never mines a block again mathematically too I suppose, although it would be patched probably if the community was still there (if the next block was for some unforeseen reason not able to be solved - bug, malicious actor, whatever).

It focuses though on a product that relies on other coins taking market share from BitCoin. It is in their interest that x% market cap is BTC and (smaller) y% is alt coins. I think competition is good, but to invest all this funding into the "core" whose source of capital seems to rely at the moment on moving traffic away from BTC.

It takes me a day or so to download it as is, thats stopping my netflix. You forget that as the chains grows networking tech will presumably grow even faster. Also, the power has to exist *somewhere* to process these transactions. Wether it is BTC or ETH or LTC, Paypal or Stripe or World Pay, Visa or MasterCard or Western Union, Barclays or HSBC or Bank of America, a man that takes the time to be the ledger for his tribe, or [someone working out a hash by hand]( At the end of the day it gets to a point where it harms value because it isolates itself from certain markets by making transactions so scarce. BTC can currently do 3-4 tps (transactions per second). ETH can do around 20 tps. Raiden (lightning for Ethereum) can do as high as 1 million tps. Paypal **does** 193tps, right now. Visa does 1667tps. The banking industry does a peak of 1400tps. While I have made other reasons I don't think it matters makes it obvious, in harms even value in the long run, as it makes Tokens, alt coins and other currencies necessary to make these systems work and transfer value to them.
 Lets say it is 4tps. BTC blocks of 1MB can currently do 0.00239952009% (1667 / 4) of what Visa can. at high fees, ignoring other stores of value and their tps. Even though credit, debit and "virtual money" out value cash transactions in many countries now, imagine how many millions of transactions humans make every second. 
In my opinion it is a goal to make BTC a store of value and not the promised p2p decentralised cash.

You said it yourself:


What I meant is there is no reconnect code because a third party could steal it. This means you can't open a weekly bill with WallMart. If you or they go offline then there is no consensus on how the coins should move forward and they are returned to whoever is specified or the funds are lost. You don't have to give back what you took if you are a bad actor. A weeks worth of hot funds could sink a lot of companies if they experienced a seconds downtime.
There **has** to be a third party in which you send BTC to be used with merchants because you need someone who has the power to make sure no one loses any money off chain because the third party will witness the transaction, be an arbiter and/or reopen the channel and continue on for you.

[You can do about 0.67 hashes a day, let's be generous and say two a day]( The BTC network does about 9 trillion hashes a second.

Now is not the time to buy Monero IMO. I love the growth but it's still yet to find it's market: it even has scarce adoption on the dark web. It's an amazing currency but it's hard to reach the people it serves. It could do a BitCoin and keep growing, or it could do a Dogecoin and tank.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:46:56
High hash powers could also easily take over the network then and cause havoc until more power gets put into the network. The next difficulty in 7 blocks time will already be 26% of current rate.

Not specifically mentioned though are they?
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:05:27
Lightning is possible on BCH and not everyone wants it. I don't think the solution is that I must keep an open connection to the peer the whole time - if one of us drops off, any tx made are invalid and the funds are locked up. Either that or I have to trust a centralised third party, defeating the point, or paying massive fees, making it unwise. I think something like using Ethereums smart contracts as a lightning layer for BTC would work nicely. It doesn't have to be Ethereum, but you can make contracts using programming languages that are irreversible (well, you can hard fork to change the past as Ethereum did once, but let's not go there....) and by design you can be given Ethereum tokens directly for BTC which can be exchanged for any currency. You could create your own token on top of a fast payment network backed by by BTC. The tokens would be equivalent to the USD, GBP, EUR etc in this situation. I think lightning is a nice option if you like it, maybe it's good in some use cases like two trusted business partners or in areas where it doesn't matter so much if there is an error - no one is going out of business if my phone drops connection and I didn't pay for my coffee. 
I think Lighning is an option not an answer. The answer is out there or coming.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:53:07
No, BitCoin Cash does not have segwit, neither does Bitcoin Unlimited and no one knows how popular btc1 *really* is (SegWit2x)...
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:29:41
It purposefully doesn't have centralised development and no one owns the BitCoin code (well.... some LN and SegWit stuff is patented...), this is also by Satoshis design. In no way is it criminal. BitCoin is built upon dozens of freely available code in terms of hashing libraries etc
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:59:42
That's not original at all though is it? It's very different, and it's only going to differ more once SegWit gets used. What you mean is the "most popular", not the original. BCH is closer to the "original" than BTC will be once SegWit starts being used, but that's not the "original" either. No chain in use matches the "original" white paper.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:03:48
Oh so you're just spouting your mouth off. Thought so.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:24:47
I will be honest, I meant more Core than the community at large. However Gavin is a big player no matter your opinion of him and like you say he's talking BCH. The people leading BTC aren't the same people who founded it, and it seems they have some different goals - of which are personal opinion on being good or bad. I think it's good for a store of value, bad for a peer to peer cash system.
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:14:11
Because it just directly forked from BTC?
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:46:55
ok but they will not find you on a non standard port? fair enough, but doesn't exactly invalidate what I said. it is not however s bad thing. as in another post i quoted, it is to stop an application on another port initialising denial of services to another application as nodes relentlessly try to connect to them.
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:54:42
On multiple machines, yes. Not on the same IP.
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:15:00
If you set listen=0, making it a non fully functioning node. I wished to run both on one VM and be a cheapskate, you can not. I am not saying you can not run two nodes, one of which does not listen. You knew that was what I meant too as I had looked into it and come across this 'solution'. What I said is true. Other nodes will reject a non standard port. Saying you can not listen at all does not discount this at all.

Well.... they want a large say in it. In my ideal world every country in the world pumps the money they currently put into their own currency into bitcoin instead or whatever crypto by then and we as nations would represent each other in this network. A lot would have to change obviously in government to give them this trust though. I don't think it could ever happen sadly (as in, we would like it, not they would attempt it). But did Governments actually serve their people and not their richest and corrupt interests, they would be perfect bodies to run the supermodels while we could all run our own if we liked too.
Sorry, just musing a bit there on something I thought of before. I don't think they want control but they want a big slice of the pie. There is no point if they hold it all, it is again another CNY then.

Good advice for the new or cautious but if you wait a month you don't get a discount. Investment is risky, its inherent. Just because most if us never played Wall Street doesn't mean we shouldn't learn and somewhat act like them if you're investing not making purchases with Crypto. I do both.

Have you polled your users though in a way there would be no repercussions for being honest and giving their opinion on if they think 2X is a good idea? I am not saying you *would* do that, but it would be interesting if you published an open source poll that showed that verified users can vote anonymously. In the same way signalling is political, so is openly showing your support when what pays your bills seems to be officially against it.

I think one day, maybe towards the end of our lives, crypto will account for an over 50% volume of financial transactions. Don't you? Every government wants that, but they had to give up many things in the past. It'll get to the point they'll have to. The Chinese government is actually very interested in BTC and BTC related businesses. They are very happy a possible very significant amount of a future huge currency is being mined in their country. Why do you think they have it so easy and get such cheap power? Read between the lines. They are not blind, they want in.

Not necessarily no uses, crypto graffiti for example. Someone put an article about the truth of Tiannemn Square into the block chain in english and chinese and uploaded the photo of tank man. Not necessarily really saleable though, unless we're talking 1BTC = $1 or something as a fee to write to the chain. There have been many other novel ideas too. But it is an **immutable ledger**, and tx data can contain data like text and images.

Could be an exchange that settles on chain once a week. It was Monday in China at the time

which current members of the core team were on satoshi team 8 years ago?
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:34:41
even after your big long paranoid paragraph, yes. bitcoin has already had two hard forks, one in 0.8 where the database format was changed and once when  a bug gave a malicious user billions upon billions of bitcoins. A patch was released and all transactions after the exploit were removed. on top of that, invalid blocks have been mined before, mined on top of, and then dropped to merge back to the longest chain so we've a long history of withstanding forks. BCH went fine too.

You can connect to them, they will not connect to you, hence no two way communication.

Lmao. You should have seen back in the Gox days. $30-50 to $2-4 in 24 hours. These dips happen a few tines  year. If the price is trending down, buy, don't sell...
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:30:42
You are so wrong it's unbelievable.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:14:06
Ok but if you disagree then your idea of a block size increase gets no attention because what reason? If you were to run BitCoin Unlimited you can set the limit of whatever blocks you would like to accept as a maximum in your config.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:40:32
At this point. Had we had a crystal ball 5 years ago and seen what (hopefully temporary, although years long) splits have led to. We could have pleased almost everyone. Every faction though is too focused on their one big stick to see that we should have all been working together ad simultaneously, not saying, 'we work on this first, then this, then then this. then if you're still around after X massive changes you may or may not have supported, we might maybe possibly look at your thing now'. We might have taken slightly more time overall and be set back a few months, but our community would be as string as the early days, not split into a few major factions who have similar goals and even agree with a lot of their oppositions ideas - but as options, not THE option.
I am sad we missed out on the BU thing, that coulda been a big opportunity. It is 100% compatible with the chain that most clients used (although does it have segwit opt in supply? unsure). The main big diff in my mind? BU rather than hardcoding the limit, it added support for normal, smaller and larger groups and allowed nodes and miners to put the max block size they accept in their config. This way development of cool and interesting ideas could have continued with the community of nodes and miners between them could have moderated the growth of the network as needed. We could have even done stuff like up block size around xmas season, then lowering back down later.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:53:37
Yes it would, scarcity means there is a fixed amount and demand.

Not true. Theres a reason 2x doesn't have replay protection. They wish to kill the core chain for good if they have enough consensus.
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:57:03
How do you know how many nodes BTC1 is running on? Please tell us because it acts the same as Core's client until November.
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:29:59
Because I'm a random redditor and not a BitCoin-ABC or Core dev so I don't have to answer that question? Does it make you uncomfortable I am bringing up other things?

Many countries banned weed or heroin or whatever else. It doesn't stop it. The spice must flow.

Yes in my hypothetical it is an exchange that auto settles every Monday on chain
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:04:29
No way that is figures since fiat began. At least 10-20x that in those countries.
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:46:43
So you are a core/ABC dev? If not, what are you doing here?
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:47:55
Only to a certain point. It's not ideal anyway.
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:43:25
Obviously the value of an item and the item itself are different... That's not was being debated here. I am not saying there is a finite cap on fiat value that can be applied to a bitcoin, but a bitcoin by nature is itself a scarce resource.
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:29:34
No, you know very well it's probably 99% BTC. I know, I've been using them since the start.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:04:37
Right... but it doesn't make it any less of a scarce item. It is not an infinite supply. You could move the decimal place ten over and it'd still be a scarce resource. It's like gold, you could sell it per atom but that doesn't make gold not scarce. It still has a fixed supply.

Well done, you understand one of the core catalysts. It is evident the people or person known as Satoshi had been at work for a few years but the collapse of the banks was the perfect time to launch. They probably predicted it.

At the tx sizes we have it is a non issue for anyone with capital to start an exchange.

Good advice for the new or cautious but if you wait a month you don't get a discount. Investment is risky, its inherent. Just because most if us never played Wall Street doesn't mean we shouldn't learn and somewhat act like them if you're investing not making purchases with Crypto. I do both.

In what way do we have worldwide adoption? One person In every country accepts it? Are you sure? Papua New Gineau, Madagascar?

Is that coins traded or value of revenue?

Level out maybe but what are the guys who are stuck still holding some coin they don't believe in anymore going to do with it? Try asking for more? They don't have a bargaining position
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:08:00
Thanks mate, you too. Nice condescension. You can not run two full, open and listening nodes on one IP address and have it accepted to the network.

How would it ever kill both?

They do deny it though, they say they gave it for scaling research.
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:32:11
So then you're saying 95% of miners were running BTC1?
No one knows how many nodes run BTC1 including LukeJr.

What do you mean never? The title of the whitepaper is "BitCoin: a peer-to-peer cash system". Not settlement layer. Not digital gold. The people who bought into the ideals that got us here today were promised *digital cash*. IMO if you'd have told them it was to be like good, a digital store of value and not for transactions, it'd be dead by now.
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:25:00
The only way this could end in tears is if you ALSO raised some BTC from crime and this large cashput might shine light on it. Eg you were a dealer on the DNMs.

No, BitCoin ABC is a project started by someone who was on the team to research scaling. Nobody gave anyone money and said make BitCoin Cash.

But you are saying anyone who runs a node of these forks is part of these groups. I support BCH and while I do not agree with the direction it is going, I would like to run a BTC node through BU as I support the projects idea - that we can vote on block size by changing a config file, and can come to a consensus through nodes on the block size for BTC, not hardcoded values. While I would say I support BCH more, I would like BTC to also survive, although at this point it seems it will be more digital gold, while I all these years used it and wanted it to be cash. Many people are like me and run just one of these types of nodes. It is not some mass conspiracy. It is a consensus split and I think in a years time we will have 2-3 forks, one dominant, one that will be close and may or may not eventually eclipse the other, and one which will be barely limping along by then.

The conversation we're having though is about how bitcoin could easily be used as a tool to dismantle government. How is this realistically possible? Just because **you** think 0% tax is great and that taxation is theft that does not mean that Bitcoin as a currency has any opinion on the subject.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:47:14
You mean the people who were knowingly supporting a criminal enterprise and avoiding taxes like PlutoPete who went to prison over it?
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:11:06
That's not a Dark Net Market, that's a personal shop you're setting up on the dark net which I am assuming you will pay taxes on, so legal. You can not sell items legally on an unregulated criminal enterprise.

You said I was


for saying


Please explain? Or does this statement actually apply to you by being both hostile and full of shit?


You are projecting your own ideals onto the project. Bitcoin is just a currency, if it were to be used within our current systems that we all rely on it would be subject to the same sorts of taxation, it would just replace what stores your currency takes the place of and how transfers are handled.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:06:31
no you are fine right now. basically as of tomorrow there will be two networks to connect to - one which continues on as we have now, and one which takes the balances of all addresses, all old transactions etc and forks off from there with new rules. so tomorrow you will have an equal number of BCH as you have BTC now.
it doesn't need to be a new wallet today, just one you own the keys to.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:55:54
download electrum
start a new wallet
note down private keys
move BTC to wallet
then tomorrow, after the fork has happened, move coin to another new wallet you own the keys to
then you can use the private keys for the wallet you set up today to use your bitcoin cash

Or they would just not accept customers from the US like other exchanges. There's a lot of countries out there that do not comply with your countries standards.

Don't think Satoshi ever came out as anti-tax, just against excessive taxation. I don't see how if we all switched to BTC tomorrow for all transactions it'd be impossible to tax?
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:23:29
Bailout of banks, yes. Doesn't even touch on taxation. Like I said though, AFAIK, he only was against excessive taxation. He was a fan of having roads and public services I believe. Feel free to prove me wrong, I'm happy to see the quotes.
Do you need me to explain tax to you first?
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:05:47
He got pulled in for selling mylar bags, bongs, legal highs etc - only later did they find out he also sold illegal goods. You can't legally sell on the darknet markets.

Yea it's cool bud. I'm sure there will be plenty of people there to help tomorrow if you need more assistance :) as long as you have the keys in your control you will control your BCH tomorrow.

There were no legal items, look at Pluto Pete who went to prison. Supporting a criminal enterprise &amp; not paying tax.

Are you considering going after him legally, Mark, as it seems he was involved in your exchange collapsing?
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:16:06
Sorry mate I will concede that I didn't read usernames. My bad on that one.
You knew what I meant. What about the rest of what I said?




If you were not aware that is what I meant then you are now aware. I think it's kind of clear in context as I continue to mention public services. So would you like to refute these or are you going to argue semantics?
What about the rest of that post that I made above:


Which I think you saying


pretty clearly shows. I am happy to pay what I would consider fair taxes to provide things like infrastructure, welfare, healthcare etc. You do not think it is good idea that we should look after those poorer than ourselves? I do but bitcoin has no opinion and Satoshi never said that he was against it either, did he?
Again, you are 100% right on getting your names mixed up. Bit of egg on my face for that one. Now lets see if you've got some substance.

Oh great, then we can disregard your vision too.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:24:32
And in what way did Satoshi support these ideals, how does Bitcoin as a currency promote these ideals and how do we keep the lives we are largely content with intact as a society without keeping taxes? The original post was about how it was obvious to get rid of governments which rely on taxation with the use of bitcoin. How? You think the majority of people in the world would be willing to give up these things so that those who hold more currency than them can keep more of it locked away in wallets?
You are expected to pay your fair share. If not you are free to move to somewhere like the backwaters of Africa. You'd better hope you do not rely on services which were paid for or subsidised by the government like running water, electricity, phone lines and towers and such. You might have a problem using bitcoin under these circumstances though unless you have *a lot* of it. And you're still ultimately connecting to wires that do use government funds.
