If you prefer HODLing Bitcoin and other cryptos instead of trading, it may be worth considering a passive indexing strategy to help manage your crypto investment.

That's assuming a degree of confidence and understanding from the investor. If you're new to crypto, exactly how are you going to make educated investment decisions?
I'm sure if many people could choose a long-term crypto strategy without actually having to trade, they would do so.

An alternative to addressing that issue would be going with a rolling high/mid-cap strategy (ie. top 50) that replaces coins as they fall out of the crypto market cap rankings?

For the amount of crypto owners choosing to HODL their crypto, I'm not surprised there isn't a larger proportion of people in the community who choose to implement a passive management strategy for their crypto investments.
Consider incorporating an actual crypto index &amp; passive rebalancing strategy to help you grow/manage your portfolio.
Remember: It's not about timing the market, it's about time IN the market!

For those still weathering through crypto winter, it's worth considering implementing a crypto indexing &amp; rebalancing strategy to your portfolio instead of HODLing.

If hedge funds are getting in during Nov/Dec 2017, imo that just bad timing rather than the concept of indexing being stupid.
When markets are still down 80% from ATH, of course things will still be looking bad. However, from the concept of a passive investment, it's never a bad time to implement an actual strategy.
For every index fund that's no longer in existence, there are two being created in its place.

Appreciate the feedback! Just wondering, what are the 3/4 that you wouldn't label shitcoins?

Management implies a strategic direction or investment approach for a portfolio. But again, the act of doing nothing is action itself.
