Until you consider the fact that the crypto market moves much faster than the stock market does. You may have heard it a lot, so you may think it’s a meme. But the crypto market is open 24/7/365, while the stock market is only open for 6.5 hours, 5 days a week (not including holidays). 
So doing the calculations, the crypto market is actually open about 5 times longer than the stock market. 
So the 1-year bear market in 2014 would be the equivalent of a 5-year bear market in stocks. The 2.5 year bull run from 2015 to 2017 was the equivalent of a 12.5 year bull run in stocks. The current bear market which has lasted for about 5 months, is the equivalent of 2 years in stocks. 
Luckily this means we will have a quicker recovery time than the stock market would.
Also the crypto market is 8 years old, not 4 years.

But just to be sure... Electrum itself is safe correct? I downloaded Electrum wallet from electrum.org and on my computer, the exe file is called "electrum-3.1.2.exe".
This is the safe version?

$6k is just a small rest stop on the highway to $3k.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:47:04
10 minutes is only an average. It could take longer or it could be shorter. I've seen blocks that only have a couple minutes between them and I've seen blocks with an hour between them.
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:09:03
A lot.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:05:26
Relatively I guess. I joined in December and have held until now. Never considered paying with Bitcoin until recently though. Why do you assume that I am new just because I want to pay with Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:38:21
Did you reply to the right person? If you actually meant to reply to me, he said nothing about market manipulation and neither did I. As a matter of fact I do fully believe that the market is manipulated.
@_date: 2018-03-19 04:06:23
Just met up with someone for a face-to-face Bitcoin purchase with cash. Glad I didn't get robbed. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:29:01
I don’t have to file a tax return because I made less than 10k in 2017 so that’s pretty cool.
Even if I did have to file a tax return, I’d be paying like $3 in taxes anyways so it’s useless.
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:00:03
She is lucky that it didn't verify instantly lmao.
Anyways, I am unsure if Coinbase and Gemini work in Canada, but have her try either of those.
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:25:15
Is there anyplace online where I can learn and understand about how the underlying technology behind Bitcoin functions? I want to know literally everything. Any good resources for that online? Be it a YouTube channel or a series of articles or whatever. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:47:13
No I am saying 3k because that’s an 85% retrace just like the last major crash. Now I know that past doesn’t predict future but it’s the best we have to go on for the time being. I am certain that we will never see $200 ever again. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:47:58
Same. I can’t see it going much lower than that. 
However that’s the same that people have said about 18k, 17k, 15k, 12k, 10k, 9k, 8k, and 6k. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:39:12
I hope that Bitcoin’s scalability issues are resolved one of these days, for good. I would very much like to walk into a store or restaurant and pay with Bitcoin but I’m afraid that eventually, that honor may go to Nano or something. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:45:49
That’s me. Coinbase for fiat, Binance for alts, and Coss for the project. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:10:33
Would also mean double bottom! However it would break log support. Idk if that’s bullish or bearish. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:19:21
Can you drink a few more cups so I have a good entry price?
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:40:43
Just 2 pizzas worth?
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:08:21
That's a good point on fiat. However gold would still be safe.
And I don't know about that. Bitcoin would still require computers to use. And I know that Bitcoins are used all over the world so it wouldn't make them worthless with a single EMP over Ameica I guess. An EMP would do a lot of damage and I think that losing access to computers would be the least of my worries in that case.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:49:05
But I thought Trump and Russia colluded.
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:53:50
Because it might be going down more. But it might not. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:31:25
I bought in at $17k and wow. $17k was a shitty buy in but $19k?? How do you maintain your sanity?
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:33:42
Believe it or not, some people don’t just magically know things and they need to actually learn something for the first time. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:54:51
Ah shit you figured it out
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:51:00
Does that include meeting face-to-face to pay with cash?
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:02:03
I'll admit the idea of fiat collapsing is quite a scary thought. As much as I hate fiat, you have to admit that fiat is what runs the world today. I would hate for fiat to collapse *before* the world switches over to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:39:09
Fuck I forgot about EMPs. That’s actually a HUGE advantage that fiat and gold has over crypto. EMPs can’t destroy fiat and gold.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:57:26
Bitcoin just does not seem like a great place to put your money during periods of instability. If Bitcoin is ALREADY unstable now, during a period of relative stability, what's gonna happen to Bitcoin *THEN*?
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:30:52
This is really funny until you realize that some people probably actually believe this is true.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:47:26
Trying to buy an alt.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:57:19
Yes, what dAb74 said. And to be honest, that is the only thing that I can see possibly stopping the downtrend, as much I doubt it will happen.
It might serve as a psychological self-fulfilling support anyways since people will probably recognize the pattern.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:34:25
Great now we’re gonna crash again. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:08:15


Yeah I’m just gonna hold to avoid that possibility. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:21:30
How many Bitcoin did they sell? Was it more than the Mt. Gox guy? If so, why didn’t *that* crash the market like the Mt. Gox guy did? All I see there is a quick dip (a huge one though), but not a crash. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:10:53
I want to stop going through the bank to buy crypto, and I have some spare cash. So I think I’m gonna try out LocalBitcoins and try to buy some face-to-face. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:27:18


No what the fuck. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:47:56
I can't wait until 2021.
@_date: 2018-03-13 06:54:53
I can’t wait until Bitcoin goes mainstream. The idea of not having to rely on a bank and credit cards is just so amazing. It feels great to have gotten in on this so early. Also I can say “I told you so” to everyone who said Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme.
Also Bitcoin will always be the largest cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:31:45
Unconfirmed transactions are piling up right now. Trying to send bitcoin and it's taking forever.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:34:11
What happens then 
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:35:37
My breaking point is zero. I WILL NEVER SELL.
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:23:20
Oh I should have figured that out myself. Excuse my retardation. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:29:30
This is correct. I don’t think the market is at the ceiling, (because I do believe that Bitcoin will become widely adopted) but it is 100% correct that Bitcoin cannot grow forever.
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:15:39
It’s gonna stay right where it is for a few hours and then either go up or down 
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:13:07
This proves that we have not bottomed. We’ll be lower in a week.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:25:06
Who puts up Bitcoin ATMs and how can I get them to put some up around where I live? I hate going through my bank to buy crypto because every time I make a purchase on Coinbase, I’m always anxiously anticipating the email from my bank that says “We’ve closed your account.”
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:07:37
Ledger Nano S
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:52:30
That's good news. I have noticed that transfer times and fees are much much lower than they were a couple months ago, say January. Still doesn't beat Nano though. However I am fully aware that you can never fully eliminate transfer times (because of block difficulty) and fees (because of miners). Bitcoin still has a place in the future, that's for sure.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:28:24
Is there anywhere in Iowa that I would be able to spend Bitcoin? Maybe at a store or a restaurant or something. I don’t know why I want to spend some but I do want to. Not a lot though, obviously, this is still an investment to me. However I do believe that mass adoption and actual use is more important than investment. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:29:51
That's honestly very interesting. I'm looking into history. Very cool.
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:50:50
Please do not FOMO. This isn't a recovery. That's what the whales want you to do. Also don't open a position right now.
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:02:59
When does moth end?
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:29:42
This might be a good thing. I think it would be even better if it crashes down even lower. If it goes down hard enough it could form a double bottom. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:42:58
Listen to the entire album, it’s an experience
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:57:28
It's a shortened version, who cares
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:44:11
Because nobody uses this anymore because of the bear market. People will use it again, but hopefully scale-ability issues are fixed by then.
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:10:19
Yup I just found a local seller. Cool. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:41:20
I just want my darn Bitcoin already :/
@_date: 2019-09-08 17:05:42
Did you have the key written down anywhere or was the hard drive the only place you had a copy of it? If so, I'm sorry for your loss, but you can't get the Bitcoin back without the key.
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:04:10
Alright cool, thanks. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:21:49
Can someone who does not have lightning network still send coins to my LN wallet? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:58:50
He's probably shorting BCH/BTC instead of BCH/USD. Altcoin sat ratios can go down while the USD value goes up.
@_date: 2018-04-19 08:19:35
Sounds great, looking forward to it. Good luck! But don't feel pressured to make this quickly, take your time, man.
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:47:33
How would one use the lightning network? Do I have to get some sort of special wallet or something? Also will exchanges use it eventually?
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:53:44
I love it! I keep getting fucked by Bitconnect... so that's fitting. Are you going to continue developing it?
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:57:51
Way too high. I'd be surprised if it was even a fourth of that.
