You have common shares....  that is not what I would consider private.
I want to know more about the company that I own 1/1000 of.
Stop with the smoke screen and release some information

And back to silence...
Was hoping for at least some resolution to the questions asked

Until cavirtex releases it's year end 2013 financial report and common shares like any publicly held company I will consider them a potential scam.
I will retract this comment and apologies once this has been done.
Until then I would advise not trading with cavirtex

You think Joseph David is Joseph Toth. ...
Do you have any proof of this?

Glad your here answering questions.
After reading through all the comments, it is clear you have a lot of work cut out for you.
I think cavirtex first problem is communication, but I can see your starting to deal with it. 
It's next problem is making promises that aren't kept.
Mostly this revolves around the ipo in the form of
1) missed financial reports .....  huge red flag
2) whitewashed suggestions of dividends then retraction without a financial report...
In truth the service you have provided has been fair to good
But with new open and professional companies coming online I can see virtex slipping away.
I didnt even care if your financial report showed 0 profit
The shares I bought were for long term gain....
but bad business practices are killing cavirtex

As I said I will trust you when it happens, but this has been going on to long.
Small company does not give you an excuse for bad business practice.
Your accountant should have had this report ready months ago
