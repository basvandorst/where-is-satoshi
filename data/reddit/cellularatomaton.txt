If you buy BTC, take some of that and use it to pick up another coin down the road (XMR for example), congratulations you just created a taxable event.  If the BTC appreciated between the time you bought it and the time that you converted to XMR then you owe cap gains.  Crypto isn't singled out in this regard, FX trading is handled pretty much the same way.  
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:52:54
Not quite.  FX markets make exceptions for "personal use".  Imagine the current tax treatment with crypto based rewards programs, IOT devices, data markets, micro-transactions, browsers using metamask or tokens like BAT, etc, all deployed and adopted at scale.  That is the reality we are currently stepping into and it will result in individuals unknowingly generating potentially millions of difficult to track "taxable events" every year.  In what way is that precedented or fair?
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:05:27
The main problem with the current tax regime is that crypto-2-crypto capital gains treatment forces the liquidation of crypto assets in order to cover your tax bill for most of those who have had significant growth (i.e. crypto is now a dominant portion of net worth). In markets like this, such forced liquidation just increases everyone's exposure to volatility, while simultaneously creating a windfall payout for the government (who never had any skin in the game to begin with). Yes it is unfair, unjust and otherwise a dirty play to suppress crypto growth short term, but if we play by their rules our side will win out in the long run!
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:29:10
Of course crypto isn't being singled out in this regard.  FX tax treatment is probably the best comparison and it is treated exactly the same (with the exception of the 60/40 rule).  Yet FX at least has the "personal use" clause which would apply to a huge cross section of crypto transactions. Consider things like rewards programs, IOT systems participating in data markets, browsers like Brave participating in the BAT network, micro-transactions, etc.  That is just scratching the surface and the IRS is nowhere near ready to deal with it, so they are going to force the average user to either over-report through arduous data collection constantly throughout the year in order to avoid being labeled a criminal.  Most of these systems are already being deployed and used at scale so the insanity has just begun.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:34:24
Trump's 2018 tax plat put an end to 1035 exchanges no?  If so, claiming like-kind treatment at this point is just delaying the inevitable.  Though deferring taxes could be advantageous if crypto tanks, it would be better to pay 2017 crypto-2-crypto gains now if things continue to moon (thus pushing next year's gains into long term cap gains territory).

Sorry for necro-commenting here.  Have been away for a while.  I didn't notice before that masamunexs was linking % change to the lognormal distribution, which is only true if the non-% change is actually normally distributed.  That being said, what I was trying to point out to you in that link is that stock returns are empirically lognormal.  So by taking their log(), you are going to get something that is normally distributed.  I don't understand whether you take issue with calling this process "normalization" or if you take issue with the concept all together.  It seems to me like you are referring to normalization in the unit vector sense (which would be in the time domain here as opposed to the distributional frequency domain).

I imagine you guys are claiming to be a factor of 10^3 faster than the other exchanges due to using something like the LMAX Disruptor pattern in front of the matching engine, in which case the claim is probably true (Gox having set the bar pretty low matching in PHP or whatever :-) ).  It would also makes sense that your market makers would be connecting via private fiber directly to your gateway/mdfeed via FIX/FAST, Swift, Itch/Scratch, etc.  If that is the case, where are your colocation facilities going to be located (Chicago, NY)?  I work with some guys that do low latency dark fiber connectivity and colo hosting around the globe for the HFT industry and we are regularly fielding questions from prop shops and bank trading desks about making markets in BTC.  We also have a pretty deep basket of HFT market making and data visualization tools that we customize for our customers.  I would be very interested in learning about any OR/MD protocol that you intend to support with the intent of adapting our tools to work on your exchange (or even bundling if you are marketing Buttercoin as a white label service to banks/brokerages etc).

Some acquaintances of mine recently attempted to acquire a little known asian OTC commodities derivatives exchange.  After 6 months of due diligence, tens of millions in cash on the table, and both parties ready to paper the deal... the entire thing fell apart due to the regulatory environment in the US (read Dodd-Frank).  This exchange probably had 1k users tops, and was built mainly out of off the shelf components.  Even with a large existing OTC presence, internal clearing, market making, and broking capabilities they couldn't pull it off.
There are a ton of developers out there who have written matching engines.  If not for dark pools or internal aggregators, then for testing and simulation.  As I mentioned with the above deal, you can get a lot of the software off the shelf (white labeled FIX/FAST systems).  Post execution BTC specifics would require a fair bit of new development, but the cost of that piece will be dwarfed by compliance and legal.  Welcome to 'Merica.

In the long term, yes you are absolutely right.  While I don't have an explanation for why we see the immediate downward BTC shock, I suspect that the post stage 1 exponential movement from $225 up to $500 can be significantly attributed to devaluation followed by post shock capital flight and inflation hedging from China.

The Mike Hearn announcement was timed for maximal damage, taking advantage of a market condition that was likely going to crash short term based on past market observations.  No doubt that Mike's opportunistic timing moved sentiment in exactly the direction it was intended.
Edit: It is not a conspiracy, it is a business strategy and one that is perfectly legitimate in my eyes.  Where Mike is going (the land of myopia) you don't need Bitcoin,  you need smart contracts.  The worst possible thing that could happen for the banks would be for a viable bitcoin blockchain centric smart contract platform to hit the street before they can roll out their token.

I don't think they would make it anonymous, for the KYC/AML reasons we are probably both familiar with.  My point wasn't that they should, but rather whether or not Visa's efforts are worthy of my (admittedly cypherpunk) attention if they don't support one of the basic features of cash.
Decentralization is actually not incompatible with KYC/AML requirements.  In fact calling these systems "centralized private blockchains" is not accurate in my opinion.  I tend to agree with that these bank developed systems will be better termed ["consortium blockchains"]( because they involve a medium sized group of independent validators that are no more likely to collude than miners in the bitcoin world.
Edit: Ultimately I think consortium based blockchains will replace existing financial dark pools and OTC trading.  It is in the best interest of all crypto currencies to promote any non-public consortium chains that have legs, for without public chains to glue them together, they are back at square 1.

OP, you don't seem to understand currency markets.

Conflating the FX rate with the cost of transfer is intellectually dishonest at worst, and totally naive at best.

What we are looking at here is the USD -&gt; Chinese Yuan exchange rate along side the BTC price in USD.  The initial spike in the Yuan rate (stage 1 Yuan devaluation in August when BTC was $240) was followed by a $50 BTC crash in the following days.  After the crash, BTC stayed in a $50 range for a couple months before exponentially moving up to the $500 peak in early November.
With China's economic woes back in full force, we have seen another extreme spike in the USD -&gt; Yuan rate, another similarly sized BTC crash in the following days, and the beginning of what appears to be a similar ranging pattern to what we saw between August and November.  
I posit that the Mike Hearn drama was coincidental at best, and timed for maximal effect at worst (the Chinese devaluation had been front and center in the news prior to each shock).  In either event, it is clear to me that the primary driving force here is economic.  I'm putting my money on the bet that we stay in this range for another 2 months and then begin pricing in the halving.

Bitcoin is unleveraged?  Crypto exchanges have been offering up to 100x leverage in both futures and standard margin margin accounts.  The CFD joints are offering like 500x.  It has been this way for years.  The CME futures will bring flow unlike crypto has ever seen no doubt, but leverage is dependent on the clearing firms and their margining requirements.  Considering the modest limit circuit breaker limits (+/- 20% is nothing relative to BTC volatility), I don't see how you can make the comparison to the S&amp;P.

Or the clearing firms could improve their risk management.  Most trading firms are light years ahead of the clearing firms technologically.   As crypto aquires more dominance, there will be much bloodletting.  The CME isn't launching BTC futures for shits and giggles.  Their biggest clients and the biggest players on the field are demanding it.  I went through 4 rounds of interviews for a dev position on the cryptocurrency trading desk at one of the most technologically sophisticated trading firms on the planet (and one of the CME's biggest revenue generators) and they said in no ambiguous terms that the cryptocurrency sector is their biggest priority over the next five years (this was about a year ago).

@_date: 2017-11-16 13:11:40
No.  As you go forward in time on the futures curve, they become less liquid and their bid ask spreads become wider (therefore more volatility and risk).  This  makes intuitive sense because the further into the future we try to predict, the more uncertainty there is about the price and the larger that prediction can swing.  The CME contract will allow us to see the market approximately 6 months into the future.
Margin is a different issue.  Both spot and futures markets can be traded on a margin account.  Margin does become more difficult in volatile markets because margin calls happen more often and more quickly.

It will be interesting for sure.  My only point about circuit breakers is that in this market, we could be limit down on the CME, and then easily see the spot/physical market go 40% up before the futures re-open, so that introduces volatility clustering unlike anything we have seen in the other CME products.  Any way you look at it we are looking at a wild ride!

I personally don't give much value to price predictions.  I generally just try to stay exposed to the crypto sector in proportion to the market cap of the top 10 or 15 coins / tokens.  This strategy has done quite well over the past few years and saved me a lot of grief that you inevitably run into with trying to call winners and losers.
That being said, consider that Bitcoin currently does about $3B per day in volume across ALL the crypto exchanges.  If you look at JUST front month Gold Futures on the CME, they traded $50B in volume on Friday.  Front month S&amp;P Futures on the CME did $150B in volume on Friday.  You can do the math.  We could be talking anywhere from 10x - 50x increase in flow coming through BTC markets.  Everything I have heard around Chicago indicates that trading firms are chomping at the bit for this thing to launch.  Interesting times lay ahead!

Public / Private Key ECC  is the technology.  Blockchain based digital currency and encryption are applications.
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:39:46
Cryptography:  You can use a public key to encrypt a message and a private key to decrypt it.

A digital signature actually requires encryption.  Specifically, it requires encryption of the message digest (which is a hash).  So, for instance... when people are asking CSW to prove that he owns Satoshi's coin, they are asking him to sign a hashed message and then encrypt it with Satoshi's private key.

4.) It is unclear what you are claiming to be a criminal act.  Please clarify.
5.) Thousands of others have done the same (created their own coin/blockchain to compete with bitcoin).  Few have been able to attract anywhere near the market cap.  Partially because of the first mover advantage, and partially because it takes a lot to improve on the protocol.

I suggest you re-read the Wikipedia article, or have someone read it to you if you have reading comprehension issues.


No individual or entity has demonstrated the ability to move Satoshi's coins since he/they went off the grid in 2010.  In all likelihood the coins are gone forever.  


Most of the "victims" you refer to have been doing quite well financially.  By your standard, if 20x returns over the past few years makes me a victim, please victimize me some more!


You clearly need to do some more research.  That is not how bitcoin works or has ever worked.  Proof of work requires that the miner have a significant stake at risk (cost of electricity, hardware, bandwidth, etc).  The price is volatile and mining profits have never been anything near guaranteed, this is especially the case back when Satoshi was mining and his coin was worth zero, because there was no market.  


That amount of coin would never hit the public markets.  The only way it would ever trade is OTC, and I highly doubt you would run into any liquidity issues there.  TRILLIONS trade in the global fiat FX markets every day and you think that 5% of a market worth 100 billion is going to crash the market by trading OTC?  Lolololo!

Anyone trading on GDAX has already undergone KYC, doesn't matter what type of API you use for order placement.  Book and trade data get pushed to the client over an open pipe, and those messages burst up to 100k or more messages per second, and don't apply to rate limits.  The rate limits are for FIX commands over the order gateway, not streaming FIX data like book and trade updates.
If colocation and cross connect costs are of concern, then you aren't doing HFT (those are a drop in the bucket relative to other HFT operational costs like legal, compliance, accounting, dark fiber and microwave routes, hardware, software or FPGA developers, etc), and if you aren't doing HFT then the 3 requests per second limit is not prohibitive.  Also, if you think you can do HFT on the cheap, roll your own, etc, you probably don't understand HFT (Related: Nobody is using TA indicators to do HFT.  Actually nobody who is making excess returns is using TA, but that is another story!)
If you look at the backlog of customers waiting for AML/KYC approval on Coinbase, it is pretty hard to argue that they are letting bad accounts through just to pump their numbers.  If there was a huge increase in the number of accounts, but no corresponding increase in volume, then you could argue that they were faking their numbers, but I don't really see any evidence to that effect.

Microstructure models, flow capture and liquidity providing, informational arbitrage, forward curve modeling, derivative pricing, natural language processing, even portfolio and risk management.  Any of these classes of strategy will also most likely include in-sample / out-of-sample backtesting optimization using AI and ML techniques like principal component analysis, Bayesian methods, support vector machines, neural nets, genetic algos, etc.  The noteworthy thing is that they are NOT looking at bar chart data, because there is no new information there (akin to driving down the road with forward facing view completely blocked out, and expecting the rear view mirror to elucidate the curves ahead).  At most they will look at distributional characteristics of returns (or log returns) in order to model the noise term of some fundamental stochastic process (important for derivative pricing and risk management models).

TA is the homeopathic medicine of trading!
@_date: 2017-09-22 04:15:28
Much of it is possible as a non-professional.  Liquidity providing and arbitrage is capital intensive so I wouldn't waste too much time looking into that as a starting point.  I wouldn't worry about trading to begin with.  Start by thinking about what classes of trading strategy are even possible, what kind of data sets you would need to simulate those strategies, and how you would go about running a historical simulation, and what the statistical implications of your methodology might be (i.e. what is the difference between over fitting historical data by finding local optima and actually demonstrating that your strategy is profitable out of sample).  Once you have such a system built (say in Python using Pandas for example, or maybe a Node based system, or whatever), maybe you decide to challenge my assertion that TA is worthless, and has no predictive capability.  So you go and implement an abstraction of all possible linear or nonlinear combinations of any TA indicator that ever laid pixels on a chart, and you train a neural net (or use a GA or whatever) to adjust the weights in that function space, and learn for yourself what countless HFT firms have dumped a ton of resources to discover... that there is no more signal in that noise, because it is in the past.   And that's cool because it is really interesting and fun to go through the process of implementing strategies / models an proving to yourself that they don't work, until you find one that you can't prove doesn't work, and then your heart starts racing thinking of all the HFT Lambos you gonna be driving.  And then you remember short term cap gains and exchange fees, and the 10k GPU cluster you are going to need in order to maintain training in real time, and then you HODL.  Haha.  But you should still do it because you never know, and it is fun, and you will learn a ton!
As a side note, I'm not sure why you say that HFT is beyond the pale.  HFT takes on many forms, most of which contribute to more efficient markets.  It is simply that market efficiency should be measured in terms of information propagation rather than the bid/ask spread.

A 20% gain in 1 day is big by any standard (even crypto).  The largest single day gain in the history of the S&amp;P500 is less than 12%.

I find it hilarious that fiat currency isn't considered "strange" by most people in the post electronic banking era.  Somehow the average person isn't skeptical of the fact that their money only "exists" as an entry in a centralized database somewhere.  We live in the most interesting of times!

I'm not sure I entirely agree with what you are saying.  For example, anyone with a retail brokerage account can trade 4x leverage on stocks, and their exposure is 4x.  The leverage increases the speed at which your amount risked can be depleted, or conversely the speed at which you can profit.  From the banks position, they are just treating the fractional reserve as a margin account.  So if they want to keep playing the game after they blow through their reserve funding they have to raise their own capital or get on their knees and beg the Fed for some more of that fiat special sauce.

Not yet public.  It is something I developed for futures/cash trading clients.  Just recently put BTC/USD in there for my own trading purposes.

I think it was the intention of the writer to imply inter-bank loans, fed funds, FOMC activity etc as the source of fractional reserves rather than customer deposits.

I agree to an extent.  Thus the term "resistant" rather than "proof".  I believe it is easy to stay ahead of the curve here though, since a simple change to the algo should be able to wipe out every asic on line.  That would be where FPGAs come back into play.

Skein, Groestl and Qubit are ASIC resistant because they require a lot of memory.

Did you read the "Tulip Mania" post on CSW's website before it was taken down?  He put a lot of effort into exposing the TM myth.  Aside from the fact that TM was greatly amplified by futures contracts and regulatory intervention, [the prices for rare horticultural specimens have fat tails today as well](  "Tulip Mania" is simply the proper Keynesian Statist prose for "Free Market".  It is interesting to me that CSW wore the tulip as a badge of honor.

It is a tool that I built for my personal trading.  Not currently publicly available.

What I'm saying cash isn't "confirmed" until you can successfully deposit it in your bank account or spend it somewhere else.  A counterfeit note can be rejected at either point.  Therefore, cash is not instant.

Yes, which from my understanding makes it prohibitively expensive for ASIC implementation.  Additionally, the physical parallel logic layout of mining ASICS leaves no room for large areas dedicated to memory allocation.  Of course these things might be overcome, but I'm not aware of any progress being made on this front currently or in the foreseeable future.

It means that there is a bug in the way they are applying incremental updates from the websocket feed to the snapshot which is obtained from the HTTP API.  I dont have this bug in my system so pretty sure it is a problem with their client code (browser side).

Looks like he has picked up a little coin:

Chrome.  Though in my own system I'm connecting via node.js and using a custom user agent.  Likely unrelated, but I also notice that the prints feed frequently drops out of the WebSocket connection and the server sends a closed signal (though surprisingly the book updates continue to flow until I close down the client side of the ws).

I'm not sure why you are responding to my comment, which was simply a response to inquiry as to whether ASIC resistant algos actually exist.  The centralization issue is tangential to his specific question.  
That being said, I agree with everything you have stated.  I personally run my mining rigs in data centers where my business has excess capacity (meaning I don't pay for power), and I can't scale out the footprint completely in a cost effective manner (doing a present value of future cash flows type simulation), and can therefore confirm that there is much more to the scaling equation than mining algo.

I have no short term intention of getting USD out.  Rather, the goal would be to generate BTC alpha.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:20:48
Alpha is a common term used in finance/trading which usually refers to the time component of a stochastic process.  In the case of arbitrage it could be considered premium paid for contributing to market efficiency or even risk premium for executing the spread.
