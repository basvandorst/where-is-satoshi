My mum would actually be angry in that last slide as she would see how much money she was up and then down on. FYI mum's who don't look at charts are good at hodling.

Yeah Zukerburger, this will be the trigger that makes everyone just stop looking at fb and get on Instagram.

Yes but a bitcoin is not exactly a coin so to speak so I also think quantity is accurate.

It's part of human psychology for negative events to become easier to tolerate. So that sinking feeling fades away and the longer you hold the easier it gets. The up times remain just as exciting. Rose tinted memories are on our side. That is unless we all experience trauma.

Having coins on exchanges is not hodling yo that's just silly
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:43:19
It's nice and concise but for accuracy it could say. "However, before segwit was projected to fork, a group of. .." because it is not exactly clear the sequence in which the hard fork and then the soft fork happened, if I remember correctly? this drama seems so long ago now.

I think the best argument for him is this one kept simple. Bitcoin and banks need the same technology to keep their money secure online. The best coders are in Bitcoin, they now made lots of money and they have a currency of their own. Why would they help the banks?

You will most likely have bitcoin cash worth 37k. And other Bitcoin forks and airdrops worth significant amounts in addition to your bitcoin. I suggest you be very careful and know exactly what you are doing. And get a clean phone and computer.
@_date: 2019-07-17 09:28:37
There was a time when you could not get a bitcoin wallet on an apple phone, the app store was scared about government stuff. This kind of thing is a lot less to worry about now.

A prerequisit of creating block size debate should be that you run a node first, youll probably change your mind five times just waiting for it to sync
@_date: 2017-02-21 09:19:54
I think your on to something here. Why do we need an ETF. its just old fashioned financial crisis bait.. youd be paying someone to manage a bitcoin fund. Its like getting someone to manage a cash fund, not a lot of specialty or expertise required to do it, and you'd also need to pay your broker. Considering you can do it yourself for free and soon even on a automated free decentralised exchange, Its not going to be the way forwarded, its like releasing netflix shows on dvd. There are just a lot of drongos around waiting to be drawn in by the shiney cover right next to the candy bars at their regular checkout.

But now it seems recovering btc in the bankruptcy will be better as the price goes up and they are still pending distributions in fiat and with the unexpected  option for payment in btc. ..When do they draw the line on these 200000 coins?

Wow this new version trimmed down node option seems great!  Could run this on pretty much any old computer better than pentium single core. To store the whole bockchain you want to allow 100gb storage. There is an option in the app settings to adjust how many blocks you want to store.

So are we going to delay segwit now?. Argh..I am starting to miss fast transactions
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:53:28
More network transactions could lead to more overall bitcoin transaction demand due to greater accessabilty to more users. This could lead to more blockchain transaction demand. Leading to higher miner fees. . Thats what I say. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 10:14:10
Has bitcoin ever not been parabolic?

1. We dont need to incourage big miners we have plenty of hash.
2. Decentralisation is not the same old capitalism. or comusumerismnism or.whatever we have theae days. Because it is not selfish.
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:32:05
Why not. Bitcoin doubles all the time. Banks might pump BU to try and gain a control of it. Whilst hodlers keep there double going buy buying and hodling core, we could get a gang mentality going and get competitive on the price. Sounds like fun.

The thing is the Chinese public arnt having closed door meetings deciding what fork to dump all in one go in order to maximise profits like the etf fund will be. It centralises bitcoin buying and selling durring a fork which increases the risk of currupt practices.
@_date: 2017-03-12 02:48:42
The ETF is clearly more complex than bitcoin if you would actually bother to read the contracts. You know those things that you never read, brokers legal documents, etf structures and such. I think incomprehensible is a better word for it.
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:21:34
It is also possible to increase transactions and the velocity of bitcoin money in other non programatic ways. Reputable physical coins, and even fiat like tokens representing rights to withdraw bitcoin from a bitcoin bank with a fractional bitcoin reserve. Ahhh no what's happening!

Time is important. People are getting their tenses confused. Just because it is programmed to happen in the future does not make it incompatible now. A potential fork is not a fork. I agree with Jeff.

There are plenty of rich people out there with millions in debt, hodling Bitcoin and feeling quite happy about not paying off debt. With interest rates going down they are probably considering getting more.

This logic does not equate at all. "Even if they were widely accepted by legal merchants, it would at the moment be lunatic to exchange them for anything but real money." Exchanging for goods is no different than exchanging for so called real money. So called real money is only supposed to be useful for goods, not investment.

They actually don't want your money. Because when they receive a deposit they have to go and put 5% of that into government bonds with a negative real rate of return which means they loose out on that 5% at least. The rest they can loan out but they already have enough capital to do as many loans as they want. So really your deposit is a pain in the ass, not only because of regulation, but because they don't want to hold money, they want to make good loans and hold nothing.

You are fine if you create an encrypted paper wallet offline first  You should be doing for large amounts anyway. Printing online in a public place isn't so bad in this case as long as your encryption key is good. Non encrypted is a completely different story.

In any case they have a confused plan which will require another hard fork. So they'd split into small and bug blockers. Openbazaar takes altcoins so they support all forks anyway.

Hyper inflation is the worst. Deflation naturally re balances even after a spiraling situation. This is because people have to eat. It also creates efficient asset allocation. Inflation when induced by money printing does not re balance. People starve and eat old food. Note food and many things are perishable ie fashion. Hyper inflation creates inefficient or random asset allocation at best.

I can't think of anything that has been regulated to death. Prohibition, the war  on drugs for example.
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:29:46
I don't buy it. They are already doing their best at asserting dominance. They can't achieve 100% they never will and a fraction of a percent of national markets is enough for Bitcoin to grow. And don't forget about markets which are independent of nations, banking, regulation and legal status.

It's hard to be sure. But try leaving bit off and unplugged. Holding the on button down for 1 minute when unplugged. if you use it a lot the cache should also be over written... PS also when printing the wallet, it's easy to make sure that the printer is offline. Unplug your modem.

I think this foundation of the theory is not correct anymore. 


All savings is used and redistributed when it is in banks. Cash is basically illegal and getting worse. 
Sometimes taking funds out of the market and saving them for later is better than unproductive investment.
Bitcoin will benefit who ever "saves" it first.
