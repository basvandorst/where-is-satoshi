Fun fact is miners already getting fewer rewards(fees) and need to provide more resources like bandwidth and storage to maintain bcash. Bcash is already in an endgame the next reward halvening will already decide if they can secure the chain against 51% attacks in the long run because the halvening will arrive before bitcoins halvening and that's really bad if you share the same PoW mechanism than bitcoin. I wouldn't store a single satoshi on the bcash chain or is the unit called fake satoshi?

MtGox was just the needle. There weren't enough buyers to support the 1000 $ ranges. I think the same can happen now for 10 000$. I think the bitcoin price is supported around 3-5k$. On 98% altcoins, there is just no support at all. Almost no one from the new people coming in sadly doesn't want to hold bitcoin and I know this for sure. They gamble on tokens and exchanges like binance to make a quick bug in fiat. Tax season is also coming in... :=)

I have a couple friends they are new to bitcoin, the main problem is that they just don't get verified on exchanges to buy bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-22 14:27:35
It is not really about when the central controller will alter the chain, the tipping point is when you only have a few server farms sharing the bitcoin ledger and governments just close them down or force KYC onchain. That's the real death of bitcoin.

They are fine with 120 000 coins inflated for validating almost no transactions. 2020 Bcash will have the halvening to 6.25 block reward before bitcoin, they have almost no transaction fees. Currently, bcash has already a high chance of a 51 % attack. 2020 it will be the end. Bcash is literally the worst secured coin on the planet because it does use the same PoW than bitcoin and has fewer rewards by 2020. Good Luck even Roger will pull out by that time and jumps ahead to his next bitcoin fork scam.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:47:05

Can you explain to me how you enforce the bitcoin standard?
How is it possible that with the bitcoin standard we have currency's like tether, binancecoin and debt tokens when exchanges got robbed. At some point, it is easier to leave the system or mug someone than work around the clock to receive your currency.
I think you live in a fantasy. The bitcoin standard book is too optimistic.

You have five monkeys. Each of the five monkeys gets the same amount of Banana Coins as a currency. 
After a week one monkey owns the majority of Banana Coins. Two monkeys hold three Banana Coins, and the other two monkeys are left with zero.
To keep the trade in the Banana Kingdom flowing. You can do the following:
* The monkeys with Banana Coins left will lend out Coins via a debt paper.
* Everyone starts to fake Banana Coins
* Kill the monkeys with zero coins left
* Start from scratch and create a new Currency with the name Coconut Coin
* Mug the monkey with the most coins.
Bitcoin has the same problems, and you need a combination of both inflationary and deflationary to keep people in the system. A friend of mine is already owning BitcoinB and ETBTC as a debt token from exchanges. Bitcoin is indirectly inflating on all sides.

I give you the main reason why cryptos do not work as currency in practice, and it has nothing to do with the protocol. This will only change if humanity changes their mindset over time about money in general.
Not forced to use(This is good and bad).
Taxed like property, with paperwork if you spend it.
Volatile against fiat vice versa.

Ease of use still very hard, you can end up running out of the shop because you can't find an internet connection.

You will likely have fewer bitcoins. Genesis mining is not profitable. They are marketing pros but not mining professionals. They relocate a huge portion of your money towards marketing(remember the billboards). You actually make more BTC with them if you find others to buy a contract. Genesis is a service that the world doesn't need.
For example:
The first day of zcash mining I did mine with a homemade rig 160 h/s 0.015 zcash,
Genesis-mining did mine me 0.0075 zcash with the same hash rate.
They can't compete with amateurs... If you mine with your own card you can still sell the card later on or play video games.

bitcoins game theory is build on that coin holders, nodes and miners inside the system bahave rational to a level that they preserve and gain wealth.
the game theory is broken if irrational players from inside entering the field for example to do exacty the opposit(political reasons). it is not rational to hardfork and mine on two different chains if retargeting is 1 week away.

The fundamental conflict is still this:
5 mio bitcoiners of different ages have a treasure of 16 mio Bitcoins. 
In their skyscraper office, they decide to split the coins using this scheme: 
The oldest bitcoiner proposes how to share the coins, and ALL bitcoiners (including the oldest) vote for or against it. 
If 50% or more of the bitcoiners vote for it, then the coins will be shared that way. Otherwise, the bitcoiner proposing the scheme will be thrown out of the window, and the process is repeated with the bitcoiners that remain.
Bitcoiners tend to be a trustless bunch, if a bitcoiner would get the same number of coins if he voted for or against a proposal, he will vote against so that the bitcoiner who proposed the plan will be thrown out of the window.
Assuming that all 5 mio bitcoiners are intelligent, rational, greedy, and do not wish to die, (and are rather good at math) what will happen?

the amount of coins in real circulation is far less from the current total amount of coins.

@_date: 2017-03-10 16:58:25
one day there will be a blockbuster movie about this decision?
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:03:15
came home recently and saw that all my webservices/game servers stopped and crashed. 
the average vps/vpn comes with 70-250 gb ssd currently. tadaaaa the reason was i did finally run out of space. 
i will not run a pseudo node in prunable mode(you have or dont have the data). 
in a year or so that 500gb ssd contracts will be cheaper, i will not go back to sata. 
bitcoin nodes are not incentivised so it makes only sense to host one if you can do it next to other services. 
also i dont think that a gamer will run a full node at home while his ping is going through the roof.
@_date: 2017-03-06 09:37:41
Currently miners have the time of their life.
Bitcoin price is rising steadily every month. 
Fees are growing monthly aswell.
In short term really nice for them.
If you look at the transaction cost chart you will see a correlation between bitcoin bull runs and transaction costs. We are currently in a bullrun. For people that have to use bitcoin daily and dont hodl it would be better we go below 400$.

Diversity is great, but with that in mind, everyone should understand that Bitmain Cash was an attack at the Bitcoin community by inflating 120 000 BCH coins as a reward to lure miners away from the Bitcoin network. 
The BCH retargeting algorithm was designed to attack Bitcoin and nothing else. They are happy to use the code from Bitcoin Core but at the same time smear the developers that wrote it. A large part of the BCH community is just about attacking, bullying and finger-pointing individuals of the Bitcoin community. 
I'm fine with people experimenting with software, I don't like when a community tries to turn the whole cryptocurrency space into a toxic negative vibe.
@_date: 2018-10-22 13:26:15

Its all about consensus not about mining power. 
If the majority of **users** is happy how bitcoin works, miners dont have a say in it at all.
If 52 % of britains are not happy in the EU they look for a new home. This will eventually happen to bitcoin if it not fullfils the needs of the majority of **users**, doesnt matter how much hashing power someone has. Possible the UK will split in something new or old... You have to change the opinions of **people**.
For me bitcoin is decentralisation and store of value and this is how it currently works! Bitcoin is not a "fast" centralised payment system like visa... We cant scale like visa without abusing the power of decentralisation.

Softforking SegWit had some advantages and disadvantages.
Can't wait till Bitmain is a publicly traded company. There will be a lot more pressure on him.
If Jihan stays CEO it will be a nice short position in my portfolio. 
Finally, there will be a tool to force him out of the market. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 21:18:25


If you have Bitcoin and never use it, especially with microtransactions layer like lightning network. 
Why do you want it in the first place?
 Its called Bitcoin and not Bithodl. Which part of Bitcoin do you not understand the Bit or the Coin?


@_date: 2018-10-12 12:00:00
There is definitely a conflict of interest with sidechains and there always will be. The question is if core or a different bitcoin base layer implementation takes advantage of it in the code and does it favor or give competitor companies a hard time on their second layer implementation. There is no governance around it expect for the competitor companies to build a base layer implementation that is more in favor of the community.

Something like opendime would be more secure than giving away paper wallets. The customer could verify easily if the bitcoins are spent. The problem is still the price. If they could produce it for less than 1 $ I think this would replace paper wallets. The stick is literally Bitcoin used as physical cash.
PS: I can imagine something like that to buy pre-funded lightning channels and you can instantly pay for something, but there are some obstacles with that.

what really annoying is if someone sends you with unlucky timing a payment with 1 cent below the current recommended fee and you have to pay with that bitcoins someone else. you can wait a day and send endless mails to desolve the problem. if chinese miners doesnt accept segwit by the end of november i will pull my nodes and personal investment from bitcoin. at that point in time i think satoshis game theory is broken, because you have big players stopping protocol optimization that the majority of users want.

Lets say a 100% insured exchange will lose a 100 k of customers bitcoins. 
The exchange gets money from the insurance. The public knows 100 k bitcoins must be bought.... this will not happen. You will always get the cash and end up with less bitcoins.

as a result they will integrate more altcoins like ethereum sooner or later because they have to make money somehow.

I would say that the ledger has a better look software and hardware. Splitting coins like BCH was with the ledger more smooth. The password manager of Trezor is a good feature.

I was 99 % sure it was a ponzi before i put some money in, but electricity prices are to high in my country to mine by myself, thought in worst case i can break even. dont invest in cloud mining even if you are tempted. if they could make a return they would not sell the contracts to you. i doubt the reviews on there website are real...
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:27:22


By that standard it is implemented.
Actually you can see in the bitcoin mainnet video the hash of block:
Block: (475783) 0000000000000000003bb496a1c8778f16ae3329e5a442255771fedcdb3e0113

What is your proof? Read to much bcash subs?
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:50:02
But miners want 2 mb blocks? Bitcoin core developers not.
@_date: 2016-12-04 10:47:44
I think that with segwit + 2mb hf 30% of the full nodes would shutdown shortly afterwards, including 3 of mine because they run out of disk space(ssd). In real life high-end server have disks(ssd) around 250-500gb. I pay yearly around 750$. I could just buy another bitcoin?
You know the crazy thing is? The 5000 bitcoin full nodes are not owned by 5000 user. Realistically 1500 are inactive or on not relevant versions and 3500 are owned by probably 500 user and companys. 
I predict that with just increasing the blocksize everytime we hit a limit, full nodes will only be hosted by large bitcoin companys. At this point bitcoin is owned by companys and not users.

Bitcoin is a global database in which all participants have permission to read. 
Observers known as miners have write access by providing computing power. 
Coin holders own the right to add entrys to the ledger.
Bitcoin solves in an elegant way through blockchain technology that the records are valid. 
Bitcoin users are investing in a network that can not shut down by central authoritys.

Some hope that bitcoin will crash like 2013 back to 200$-1000$, they dont get the difference between (2013) 10 000 people holding and (2017) millions of people active holding bitcoin. The bitcoin ecosystem/infrastructure also changed a lot.

As long as core doesnt implement a 2mb hardfork on their own. I doubt that not a high majority of merchants, exchanges will not go with segwit2x especially with a high percentage of the hashrate.

I think the idea of trading is to have more and not less. Exchanges are literally modern pyramids and the tomb raiders are the employees. 
If you think about it Bitcoins deflation is actually causing inflation proportional to the decrease in supply by everyone that cant compete in the system to create other tokens. The cryptocurrency market as a whole is as inflationary as fiat money by design, that's the real tragedy to learn from exchanges getting hacked.

@_date: 2019-08-25 22:14:23
I mean most protocols are developed with no user experience in mind by a diverse group of backend engineers, the reality is it will be hard to fix the UX in Bitcoin and in Lightning. Bitcoin is a fat protocol that takes a lot of profit incentives for the applications on the top away. So far there is no killer app that is more worth than Bitcoin. Also in an opensource community, a lot of resources are getting distributed and everyone works on their own little project that is not great and not terrible. It is what it is and Bitcoin has also its charming site with all the little nerdy projects.
So far we have seen that companies like coinbase, bitpay, bitcoin.com and bitmain that did profit the most, try to fight about gaining control than rather invest in development over the last 2 years and that's somehow the downsides of a fat protocol like Bitcoin.

As long as node owners dont get a share of the block reward there is no incentive to maintance a node if you dont own a large stake of bitcoin.

I actually think Roger still makes a great bug milking his followers. He provides every major piece of infrastructure in BCH (social media, wallet provider, mining contracts, casino games, exchanges, influence dev. funds). The main reason, in my opinion for the CEO change is he runs in to really hot water(KYC/AML) with providing exchange services with his newly released Local Bitcoin Cash and his upcoming exchange platform for multiple coins. It can be very tricky to run money exchanging business depending on the shifting legal framework worldwide... The US gov. showed more than a single time they will go after you doesn't matter whats your citizenship or location is, so having a fall guy in place that makes all the critical decision in the company is great.

I bet the miners all sell B2X on future markets currently. B2X chain will be created just with a minimum of life support so that they are able to cash out. That's the only reason currently to signal to prop up the B2X future markets.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:19:32
Look at the price chart. It is highly profitable to signal B2X.
It achieves the same thing as when the european central bank signaled there asset purchase programmes. It basically says we will mine every bitcoin fork, doesn't matter how supported it is(e.g bcash) it just has to be listed on an exchange. B2X will be not the last fork.

I mean after 10 years the barrier to buy an asic miner is still much lower than to get your hands on enough coins to even start staking(amount does variate between different projects). If you buy for 2000 $ Nxt or Ardor today you will never make any ROI and if the incentive is bad in the first place you will look at a graph like this.
Also, I think mining itself is a huge part of the ecosystem. Who gets excited about staking?

I own a couple ledgers and a couple trezors and I would say that both interfaces have a less good user experience than before the forks especially for new people in bitcoin. If I open my wallet I don't want to see tabs like e.g.  legacy, segwit, bcash, segwit2x, bgold ... how long will this list be in 5 years? This is really bad customer experience(ledger is worst currently). Fundamentally they are both great products but the UI is getting worst. As long as bitcoin holders don't do their homework and pick a side by selling malicious fork coins to the ground, those attacks will go on...

They don't even have to hustle with printing tethers. They could just do an exit scam with all the bitcoins they have. People that store crypto in an exchange are doing it wrong and deserve it. I have a friend that lost twice on different exchanges his coins because they were hacked. I did gift him a ledger recently. I'm still not sure he is understanding the concept of managing his own money. He already made some comments again that made me believe that he thinks to store crypto on an exchange would be more wise than on the hardware wallet :)

You first have to find a miner that is greedy enough to mine B2X. B2X has the higher risk-reward with unproven software, dev team and low future markets price. Even if you are able to get the majority of hash power behind B2X it is still not likely that you get the Bitcoin ticker on all exchanges. As a miner, I would lean back and mine Bitcoin on November 16th and wait for other miners to mine at a lose.

The fundamental problem with scaling is to filter out good transactions from spam. As long as you cant solve this it doesn't matter if you have 1mb, 8mb, 32mb or 1gb. The only thing you achieve by adding more blocksize is centralizing the protocol further to a couple single nodes.

Craig already outlined it in the Tone Vays interview. You don't have to speculate on it. He sees Bitcoin (Core implementation) as an experiment and will not attack it and instead of trying to outcompete it with Bitcoin SV.

Not true. You are doing a "crime" "unterschlagen" not reporting it. The tax agency in Germany will determine if you have to pay or not, you don't decide that. How do you think FIFO / LIFO actually works? For every sell, you need coins in the first place. With your logic, you just have a list that makes no sense. Good luck! Of course, if you never sell you don't have to report, but that's not the topic.
You should stop spreading wrong information.

Nope, if you have the majority of devs, hashpower and community support you will outcompete the other one.

The two big political parties stifle all tech innovations. The startup scene in Berlin isn't going anywhere. The reason is pretty simple they get outcompeted by tech companies in countries with less regulation. Took them 15 years to figure out how to regulate public wifis, will take them another 15 years to permit crypto atms. It's just a simple fact that rising tech companies like Square, Spotify, Skype... arent invented in Berlin. Start your company somewhere else make it big and then expand to Germany.

Jihan is playing both sides. He just has a high interest that users can separate the brands.
According to Craig Wright, big blockers did hope Jihan would join the train and overrule the Core client rules during Jul. 2017.
Instead, he undermined the planes to specifically have 2 coins as a result because he did need a malleability fix like SegWit for an advanced token layer like omni.
Even that the information is from a not credible source like Craig it sounds quite plausible.

Actually, we are the bitcoin community. Users that run full nodes, validate our own transactions(mine) and managing our own private keys.
You got the narrative about bitcoin wrong, it's not about the 30 million users on conbase. It's about the small percentage that actually tries to manage their own wealth.

Even as a bitcoin active user i must say it was hard to calculate the right fee today. I did send my first transaction that got stuck in a while, because the mempool was rising fast and if there is no block for an hour it will destroy your fee calculation.
So i checked out your service payed in byteball and didnt get confirmed. I wasnt expecting to get my transactions confirmed for 4$(i couldnt wait for 12 hours). I mean the competition is charging you around 124$ for my transaction(lots of outputs). Anyway... :)
I also tried  but they already did not accept requests anymore.
I was in a hustle because i wanted my ordered product to be shipped... So i went with the solution ( that is very expensive but it does the job, you actually get most likely in the next block, because they are actually miners. Antpool confirmed my transaction immediately. I paid in bitcoin :).
The payment processor didnt use segwit, otherwise i would have made it.
I could have rebroadcast the transaction with a higher fee. But it seems my electrum doesnt recognise segwit transactions so far. Also it could have further complicated the deal with the payment processor.

It's funny that BCH invents(copy&amp;paste) all the stuff that didn't work out in 2013 for bitcoin. Who wants to use a twitter with a GUI and usability of a website in 2002. If you're going to beat a company like Google and co you have to be ten times better than them. The security model of BCH is worst than any coin out there, and it makes even BTC less secure. I think Deadalnix is complete reckless for not giving BCH its own security model. It's hard not to believe that Bitmain bribes him to continue ASIC Boost. I don't know what the mental model of Roger is, but I would not invest my money in BCH if I look at this chart.

If you had bitcoins on the day of the BCH hardfork you acquired them for 0$. If you dump them before 365 days you pay short-term tax. If you hold them 365 days you pay longterm tax.

Actually, if they think you did tax fraud. They will kick in your door and they will try to find any evidence. But more likely before that happens you have to convince(audit) them with proof that you don't have any gains otherwise they will estimate what you have to return in form of a tax. You are actually in debt to make your taxes truthfully and deliver evidence if there is any doubt. Macron probably doesn't care if you end up in even more debts.

Chickens are not finite enough you get that? The 21 million coin limit makes bitcoin and bitmain cash usability more like gold than cash. You have a problem with balancing, no one will spend or no one will hodl. I will predict with BCH the same as with Bitcoin as long as the 21 million coin limit is in place, it will be used mainly for speculation. Bitcoin is not a chicken sorry, even if it's in the header of the whitepaper.

You can compare bitcoins open decentralized ledger more to your home garden. If everyone in the world is harvesting at your garden, your garden system will eventually collapse. 
Roger is actually trying to convert your garden into his highly centralized farm. The best part is he is even the owner of the store where you buy the tools and seeds.
The core developer actually trying to bring other people to start their own garden.
Roger didn't help to make the bitcoin ecosystem stronger, he made it weaker by funding third parties that bitcoin should have made obsolete in the first place(Bitpay, Blockchain.info)...

Yep exchanges aswell have a strong interest to add as much as possible bitcoin forks. Eth classic could only survive because exchanges declared it legit. I promise you that every bitcoin minority chain will find new devs in a couple of days.
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:43:56
if there would be no bitcoin at all anymore. 
i think altcoin communitys including devs would get all the negative attention. 
most top altcoins have a public known leader, that will be the weakest point in the coming years. 
gov. will come down on them faster as you think if they dont make the chain AML comply like ripple. 
bitcoin is really the scapegoat in the space. 
all other projects that are developing around it should be thankfull that bitcoin has a immutable blockchain with no direct public known leader.
bitcoin is always the guy that kicked the first door open.
a weak bitcoin will destroy the whole idea.

what you always forget less coins are mined than ever and you have more people in the ecosystem. also more and more people secure there coins properly, even exchanges dont store everything they have in a hot hot hot wallet. there is no big gov. bitcoin auction anymore and draghi is printing euros like sand on the beach. also no one cares anymore about china bans. the only drama you have is the blocksize conversation. in a case of a hardfork i would even buy more coins.

If you look at the bitcoin whitepaper USAF is not part of it. 
Hashrate is king doesnt matter which clown tells you otherwise and if we would switch to PoS almost the same people are in charge.
This is more about blackmailing miners(invested big in bitcoin hardware) than anything else.
Most of them dont trust core anymore because they are not providing them a onchain scaling roadmap.
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:23:09
even if i run a USAF ready node. its a complete joke. we stay with miners and pow or we switch to 100% pos system where the coin holders are in charge. nodes are a bad metric.

**truth** is if we rise the 1 mb block limit. Node count will drop like hell. 
Im running three full high performance bitcoin core nodes (western europe):
- One server with 120 GB SSD,
- Two server with 250 GB SSD, 
I always hear from big block supporter that rising the limit is no problem because you can buy HDD with 8 TB.
But this is far fetched from the real world... I want to use my dedicated server for other services(gameserver etc) aswell. If bitcoind becomes to resource hungry people like me will shut down and i already have monthly server costs above 100€. **Capacity is not a chinese exclusive problem**. Currently we are heading to **80 GB blockchain size**... Imagine how fast my nodes will drop out with 2,4 or 8 mb limit.
I prefer **segwit** for scaling in **short** term. just vote me down big block supporter.
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:46:24


Node owners **dont** earn any money running nodes. If network capacity will rise costs running a node will rise aswell.


I highly doubt that, you speculate on miracles.
Take a look at bitnodes.21.co/nodes
5600 nodes and 40 % of them you can say are not up-to-date or sharing any interest in progress and testing of the core client.
You can easily assume that there are only 1000-2000 people out there caring about running full nodes. Because you have to take in account that there are users that already run 1-100 nodes (btcc china etc...). Thats not a healthy number if we can expect to have more than 1 million **active** bitcoin users world wide.

Reddit is not Bitcoin. It's just another social platform where people trending to talk more about the price and even that is shifting from time to time. It would be like calling out the internet because you don't like facebook. Social platforms with a large number of users tend to become toilets.
There are a lot of other communication channels like GitHub, Linux mailing list, IRC that talk more about the technology and are more focused to transform Bitcoin + Lightning network into a great payment experience.

I did deposit 100k-300k satoshis and that did work. I'm actually surprised how good the lightning network works in terms of routing the recent weeks with the overall channel capacity increase of the network.

This was agreed on, before core broke it.
You have to see bitcoin as a pipe line.
Segwit will open bitcoin to more than one pipeline.
As a miner i would see this as a threat of my monopoly?
So Segwit2x is the best comprimise. 
Miners get a bigger pipeline.
Blockstream gets second layer pipeline.

yeah the whole idea of crypto is not to peg and checkpoint everything. 
you already can buy pegged bitcoins. 
next journey synthetic eth.

There was a video about a glitch on youtube cant find it anymore, maybe 2010.

bitcoin evolved from pure anarchy while ethereum was 100% funded by bitcoiners, no one thought at that time ethereum will go to bed with every bank in town and has no network with immutable transactions. 
as i always say crypto needs a strong bitcoin otherwise with ethereum as a leader, gov. will soon force AML on chain and thats not hard with centralised leader ship.

small correction... :)
In a car race, you don't get to be declared randomly to be the winner.
Bitcoin miners fuel their expensive "cars" with electricity, if they don't finish the round first they will not receive a trophy and still had to pay for the resources to drive the round.
Bitcoin is the most competitive race on the planet.

yep that sums it up.
you just need to go to a post office show your id and the fidor document.

thats the experiment, can monkeys form a group without a leader.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:07:25
What is wrong with this community? 
We get segwit, they get 2mb.
At the end of the day we are a group of homosapiens that created a fictionary entity called bitcoin. The homosapiens did create in the past thousands of fictionary entitys like governments, religions and corporations. Those are all hoaxes in order to form a big group that believes in a certain cause.
Bitcoin is literally a group of monkeys without leader but a common goal... A leaderless society does actually go against our own hard programmed rules(gen)  and this is what you are experiencing here.
It is sometimes ugly to watch.

As I understand it, it is similar to Tim Berners-Lee Solid, you can manage your own identities and data in use case with third partys? The advantage of Microsoft's solution is MS and Bitcoin already has a large user base in place.

I think they are pioneers for buying crypto in conservative western europe.
The amazon integration was a really nice move.
The coinimal domain forwarding to bitpanda is broken. 
You guys could fix this... some of your old customers might still want to use the old domain. ;)
Pandas are lazy animals right?
