This. I stopped using Gox in 2012 when because of issues with their UK bank account, which was basically just a business account at Santander they didn't even have online statements for (they claimed to both me and my bank, yeah my bank had to get involved with them), meant I was unable to get bitcoin or a refund for 2 months after the deposit. 
The way they handled the situation back then made me realise this isn't a huge stable exchange with good systems implemented. It was a dodgy engrish exchange that was facing trouble, it being unable to comp me my deposit. So I got out. I will admit feeling shameful joy at seeing Gox go down after the way it treated me but also with the hope the exchange that replaces Gox will do it right this time.

Its because someone is inflating the price. Probably Aus LE because they plan/already are auctioning off seized coin. 
Same thing happened in the buildup to the sell off of SR's coin.

I appreciate you are trying to prevent harm to your reputation but you have to admit that the emails you sent me were badly phrased and provided no help. As I said in the other topic if I had not asked where my funds were you wouldn't have told anyone you were experiencing problems. THAT is shady practise. 
Now lets be sensible. Stop replying to posts bad mouthing you on Reddit and start working on getting people their deposits validated. You want to improve your businesses image? Start by doing things you promised to do. Sort things out and we can part company.

It took them 2 months to credit me with £21. I think they are dying. And it couldn't happen to more deserving people the amount of grief they've given me.

And what would determine my ability to make a SEPA transfer? I don't think it will hurt to say Natwest is my bank. 
Edit: Thank you for the suggestion. 
@_date: 2012-07-14 04:08:48
Hmm, When you say it like that then yeah it is. Not wishing to talk out of place or conduct illegal activity but as you said for almost 6th months the exchange rate was stable and you were getting better deals with BC than you would on the street but now over the course of a month thats changing. And you are saying thats supposed to be as designed. Not everbody is getting that message. 
This topic wasn't complaining Im not getting good deals on "pharmaceuticals" as before but rather I have no knowledge of the system. And when every piss midget reporter paints BitCoin either as a black economy or an alternative to the "real" economy its easy to confuse as designed inflation (as you call it) for an omen of something - either people are pouring money down the rat hole or bit coins are disappearing. 
But its just the market correcting itself then? It should have been rising to these prices more smoothly?
@_date: 2012-07-16 23:30:54
The other guy was insinuating it was currency problems and him withdrawing coins/dollars would mean I being "grumpy" about waiting 5 days for my account to be credited was not worth complaining about. 
Im worn out by it. A. I still haven't got my deposit or bitcoins and B. when I try to inform other people about it the piss midget defence force (why I have no idea except if they were employees of gox) saying that in 2012 its unreasonable for electronic fund transfer to happen in less time than 5 days even though Ive been doing exactly the same thing for a while. 
So in conclusion - Sons of bitches. 
@_date: 2012-07-16 06:02:06
I guess I must have done about 30 transactions with them. This is the second time Ive had to chase them up in order for them to tell me there is a problem. Which basically means if I hadn't have said anything they wouldn't of. That should have been a warning sign. But we're lazy and if something works badly then it still works. 
Not doing much for the image of BitCoin being a grey/black currency. If I had any idea what I was doing it wouldn't be hard to make a better exchange just by keeping a liquidity fund and hedging trades so that in times of problems you could take the risk. 
People saying its bleeding edge is nonsense. Once the coin is generated its exactly like changing Pounds to Dollars or Euros or whatever they use in Canada. Most places don't even charge commission on that. 
@_date: 2012-10-01 20:26:04
Its not. But their british trading was shut down as well. For laundering reasons.

Wouldn't surprise me. The amount of shit Ive had to deal with for this last transaction and the complete insincere cretinous way their customer service operates...
Anyway, lets move onwards and upwards. The best and classiest revenge I could have on Mt Gox is finding a better solution than them. 
@_date: 2012-07-14 03:45:07
Sorry whats the significance of decemeber? I understood the micro-econ recap but do we know why its inflating? IE a concrete reason other than "its summer" and why coins aren't being generated? My (limited) understanding is that we shouldn't be reaching a place where its not cost effective to produce coins, indeed with inflation and energy prices going down over the summer months, surely supply should be keeping up with demand if you have a workable GPU you should be using it. I don't. 
@_date: 2012-07-16 04:18:17
That wouldn't prove anything. Problem is them validating deposits, not withdrawing them. 
@_date: 2012-07-16 03:41:37
Ive been told everybody is going to have issues and they aren't going to attempt to fix it until tuesday. Plausibility isn't an issue here. Straight from the horses mouth after I had to go out my way to talk to the horse. Had I not done anything nothing would have changed and lots more people would be stuck waiting. 
Maybe the title is hyperbole but it is what it is. If an exchange treats people badly (Yeah we know its an issue we'll get right on it after a long weekend off) then it deserves some hyperbole. 
@_date: 2012-07-16 05:32:14
The problem is automatic validation. It doesn't work. They have to manually validate and apply account updates. The reason they aren't doing this is because its apparently a national holiday. Thats nothing to do with banking standards or anything else, that is a shitty attitude to customer service. It is totally their problem and they chose not to fix it until they are good and ready. 
It would take 2 employees maximum to clear the back log and post a message on the site saying "We have to manually process deposits this will take X number of hours extra". They have done nothing because it suits them. Not because its out of their hands. 
I presume you must work for them. Your rhetoric is that poor. I suggest you get a new calender because you somehow think this is the 1980's where everything is done on paper and transactions take weeks to file. They don't they take nanoseconds. Its called direct deposit for a reason. If it was paypal transactions there would be some truth to what you say since paypal can chargeback. I cannot. 
@_date: 2012-09-12 10:43:42
I think thats limited to business accounts only. But I will look into it. 
@_date: 2012-09-22 21:39:29
For the amount of times you have posted all that one would hope it actually answered a question. It doesn't. Just lots of talking around "Bitcoins are becoming twice as hard to mine".
@_date: 2012-09-12 11:00:18
I just checked. They do international payments but theres a £10 charge each time. No thanks. 
@_date: 2012-07-14 04:22:24
No and you'd have to explain to me what it was. 
I don't know about the gold thing. I mean you can't not agree with it being like gold but are people finally becoming smart enough not to mistakenly see it as nonsense money? Irony being our actual money is the nonsense and not bitcoin. 
Golds heading for a drop I know. But do serious investors use BC?
@_date: 2012-07-14 03:38:07
Whilst I agree the facebook tank is showing distrust in the traditional market I don't see how that results in a 60% increase in a month for a currency which (lets be honest) is mainly used by people to buy weed online. 
Economic times are grim but I would humbly suggest the fact schools out for the summer is more to do with it. I cant explain why supply isn't keeping up with demand (I know fresh coins become progressively harder to mine but we are nowhere near that limit). 
@_date: 2012-07-16 05:37:30
Good to know. Thank You. Ill remember for next time. Sadly the horse has bolted in this case. 
@_date: 2012-07-16 04:00:38
I know of Intersango and it will be my next port of call. Reason I chose MtGox over Intersango is because MtGox made it appear like they kept a reserve of currency so that if there was any problems they would cover the slack. Rather than just an open marketplace where you were literally buying from sellers.
Thanks anyway. 
@_date: 2012-07-16 03:34:50
When they set up business. This isn't the 18th century were all transactions are carried by a man on a horse. The money left my bank account in nanoseconds, having to wait 5 days to credit it smells awful. 
And the reason I posted this is because I don't want to see other people, who might have time sensitive transactions waiting, have to wait it out as well. This isn't whining its a public service announcement. 
Nice attitude btw. "Your problem isn't as big as my unrelated problem". 
@_date: 2012-07-16 21:36:45
Except of course my deposit was made before the public holiday. The holiday isn't stopping transfers but they won't fix what is stopping transfers until after the public holiday. Some would call that extenuating circumstances. Professional people for example. 
@_date: 2012-07-16 03:58:11
Really? You really think some random nutjob would suddenly decide to pick on the biggest bitcoin exchange? Why? 
One proof coming right up chum. Obviously Im going to redact the details I gave (Transaction Details) because you know, that would stupid. However I shall try and keep everything important and what I quoted:
What will you try next I wonder? Probably not an apology but some cock and bull story how one cannot expect to receive prompt service from a company taking a commission for money changing. 
@_date: 2012-07-16 03:28:38
Whats their turnaround like? Probably should have mentioned from the UK. 
@_date: 2012-09-14 02:46:32
Its been like that for weeks. Well since the beginning of the month. They warned everybody about it very clearly and before time and there still is an option to withdraw in GBP. 
Sadly they were the only GBP trader apart from Mt Gox. And seeing as Im still waiting a week after making a deposit to mt gox I presume they are going through the same thing: Metrobank instigating an investigation and account freeze. 
Looks like UKers are running out of options. Hypothetically you could continue with intersango using SEPA. But most British banks charge a fee for that and its not cheap.
@_date: 2012-10-01 18:38:59
Me as well. Still waiting for a deposit to be validated from the 7th. They strung me along for three weeks saying they'll fix it soon and then today they admitted the above. 
Ive heard of PingIt but I have no idea how it works and if it would work with a natwest account. 
@_date: 2012-09-12 18:51:04
Meh. Just a throw away remark a customer support rep gave me as an excuse as to why after now 6 days they still haven't credited my deposit despite having received the money. 
@_date: 2012-09-14 02:58:32
It would be a business account if any that allow that. Which means setting yourself up as a business. HSBC does this. 
@_date: 2012-09-12 18:42:13
That would be accepting a lot of liability. Although not my speciality I am a lawyer. Also I know next to nothing about bitcoins apart from how to move them around and spend them. 
Its something to think about. Especially since it would tart up the old CV. But would require a lot of work even just figuring out the aforementioned liability and legality. Laundering and so on. No longer the case that sums smaller than £1000 don't have to be kept track of thanks to terrorist acts. And of course Paypal is out the question. Which would mean still going with direct deposit which means metrobank and their eventual discontinuation. Unless I was really strict about where you could pay bitcoins out to (IE not silk road). Offshore like Guernsey would be an option. But I don't know how robust they are despite their reputation. 
Im open to suggestions but I am but one man with many fingers in many pies. And in case you hadn't noticed Im pretty much a novice. 
@_date: 2012-09-12 15:57:12
Um yeah. Definitely a fee. I just double checked. £10 for 2-4 business day and £27 for 1-2. So either you are wrong or you are wrong basically. 
Edit: Proof 
And I cannot see any mention of SEPA on Cooperatives website. So Im afraid you have to be wrong. 
@_date: 2012-09-12 15:29:04
Somethings going on at Mt Gox. Deposits going missing. And Customer Service admitted some kind of problem processing deposits yesterday. Im guessing something will come to a head sooner or later. 
@_date: 2012-09-13 02:57:03
Cut the bullshit. I trust this will be solved by the end of today. Because I will not tolerate having to wait over a week just to access my own money.  
@_date: 2012-07-16 05:18:49
@_date: 2012-07-14 04:26:25
Yeah I had considered that. The prices haven't moved though and as I said I "noticed" this over the month, the exchange price was rising but the cost price of things wasn't altering so without all this (new to me) information it seemed like something was going wrong, not right as seems to be the case. 
@_date: 2012-10-01 19:38:12
I presume its Silk Road related. Like Intersango last month. 
@_date: 2012-07-16 03:28:01
Wrong. Amateurs have downtime. Businesses have redundant systems to avoid issues like this and if things really go wrong Businesses go out of their way to inform customers of the issue. As I said had I not emailed nobody would have said anything. 
@_date: 2012-07-14 04:46:43
Thats a big Well. These guys have seem to have normalised it but Id be open to conspiracy theories. For the fun of it. 
@_date: 2012-07-17 01:39:55
Fair enough. But you should have put it on your website. You knew about the error and yet still allowed people to deposit funds. Its not about the delay, although it would have been nice if you got emergency staff in to correct the error, its the fact that unless I emailed you then you wouldn't have told me about the problem. 
@_date: 2012-07-14 04:14:58
I see. Is that intended? I mean I know the diminished returns is but was the aim of the currency to provide investment? I know all money is a short term store of value (Keynes) but isn't that the antithesis of bitcoin?
@_date: 2012-07-14 04:03:40
Ok so that means inflation can only be new people chasing money being produced at the same rate. Question then is is it just local "Its summer and people want to use Silk Road" or is it proper long term investment. I don't like the idea of either tbh. The former is messing up SR and the latter is too apocalypse sounding. 
Are there projections of what the exchange rate will be at the end of the year? Why are people (the other guy in the thread) are making a big deal about december?
@_date: 2012-09-12 10:43:05
Im almost tempted to look into what it would take to start my own trading site for the UK. We are criminally overlooked. And the problem is the fact the banks, namely metrobank, do not want to play ball. 
@_date: 2012-07-14 04:31:35
Oh no doubt Ive been valuing it as play money to hide drug transactions. Id admit it freely. I just didn't know how wrong I was. Because nobody is saying anything.
