I'm skeptical any government employee would stick his neck out like that for such a notional benefit to *someone else*.
If Snowden were to die, of any cause, it would cause a great deal of trouble for people now in power.  Of course, if it were to become believed that whistleblowing is dangers, that might benefit someone in the future, but the kind of person who thinks in terms of long-term benefit for the agency or for the country general does not order assassinations.

Your basic position is that it's OK to be anti-semitic because Jews really are evil but it's not OK to bigoted against Blacks and Mexicans because they aren't evil.
That's a logically defensible position, but it's also the essence of racism.  That's what it *means* to be racist: to conclude that the certain races are evil.  Before you go down that path, you should consider the company you keep.

You need to boil it down to a fixed, but extensible, set of algorithms that are parameterized by a small set of scalars.
As it happens, I hold patents for algorithms in exactly this area (complex calculations of retail prices).  Fortunately for you, the patents expired last years.  PM me if I can be of any assistance.

*You* may be blaming bankers in the literal sense, meaning "those who run international financial institution", but the article was using it the more traditional sense: "Jews".
And the vitriol with Jewish-associate institutions -- Israel, banks -- are criticized certainly suggests a more intimate animus.  Arabs might be mistreated by Western standards in Israel, but they are certainly treated better than they are in any Arab country, which you think would be worth something.

It's not that these jobs are or are not associated with these ethnicities -- it's that they are traditional slurs.  And nobody killed millions of blacks and Mexicans in supposed retaliation for the harm supposedly done by dancers and fruit-pickers.

The only risk with BitCoins is double-spending, and those would usually be detected within 10 minutes and (effectively) always within 30.  (I don't know that fraudulent double-spending has ever been attempted, but the theoretical risk is there.)
