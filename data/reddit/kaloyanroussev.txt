What does an FWP mean?

So this year we are looking at the biggest price collapse since 2014?
@_date: 2017-03-11 11:51:33
what are the highs you are forecasting based on? What good is coming in the bitcoin world? Are you oblivious about the hardfork?
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:51:06
because of the hardfork?
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:57:57
haha I wouldnt work for them though :D
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:50:43
arent you worried about the hard fork?
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:15:00
how is dropping 6% thriving :)
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:24:36
is the hard fork a bullish or a bearish event? how likely is it to happen?
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:30:48
I think you are just guessing even though it is plausible. I am also among the ones who stay away from bitcoin until the BU stupidity is resolved.

Bitcoin is going to tank if the hardfork happens.

I think the fear of HF is not priced in and price is only being inflated due to euphoria and no underlying fundamentals. Most people seem to be careless about HF and I am not buying until the HF happens and the price hits $120

Do you actually think that to learn how to use reddit (click the buttons "submit a link" or "reply") takes more than 10 seconds? It's not a skill you master over months and years you know, its just a medium for expressing opinions in actual areas of expertise. Jeez

How are we going to find out if there is no announcement? Most people will assume its a silent approval and start buying, and then the news will break that tis actually been secretly rejected and prices will plunge. This is a very dangerous situation
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:29:58
could you say if its approximately a month, 6 months, a year? I want to get out of bitcoin before this happens, because it will be a very bearish event imo - I am now considering whether to buy back into bitcoin again and I want to know if I have time to get another rally before this split happens..
@_date: 2017-03-11 19:04:31
are we talking approx within a month, within a year? 
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:45:30
so either way the price is going down mid-term?

precious metals dealers are always about hyperinflation this, hyperinflation that - its the best argument pro buying gold and silver. even though it is plausible, Im tired of this.
