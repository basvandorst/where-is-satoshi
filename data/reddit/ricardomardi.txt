IS it really a move to Canada or is Canada just a stepping stone onto some other country somewhere in South America?

OOhps! Looks like the wave form 'collapsed' his little face! Poor Kitty. Such is the sad situation with Karpeles &amp; the mystery of the 'disappeared' coins that we are left here to only be able to talk about his cat.

""all the problems of gold inflation gold had"...sorry...gold inflation? or fiat devaluation?

Great work to the OP, Thank you..Yes, my BTC balance is the exact amount I had just before the shutdown.  Even though this may sound ridiculous to some I have not given up on my coins. Mark K, if you are reading this, YOU WILL RETURN THE COINS...I WILL NOT GIVE UP TILL WE SETTLE THE SCORE! I'm not one of those who's just going to walk away &amp; leave you in peace, you will REFUND US.

I respect that you have your opinion &amp; choose to highlight the material that supports such a viewpoint, and without in any way attacking you for it, I want to remind you that so far we have allowed them to because we have been brainwashed for hundreds of years. But progress occurs, better ideas happen, things will move forward..and this  'GOVERNMENT is our MAster' mentality will also fall by the wayside just like all the other silly belief systems in the past.

Good point...we may all just be made of 'bits' - part of some matrix reality within multiple probable realities.

"The reality is, you work for them. They own you." I understand that you believe this but maybe people have to learn the truth, and that is that the government is nothing more than a group of CORRUPT public servants and sooner or later  they have to get on their knees &amp; bow down to their masters - us the people who feed and give them TEMPORARY employment. The sooner people wake up to this, the sooner we get rid of all the stupidity that causes all the corrupt/wars &amp; financial disasters. It really is that simple. If anyone 'owns' anyone, then WE OWN THEM. As citizens, we have the responsibility to act, each and every one of us can help to make a difference &amp; the sooner we acknowledge this responsibility, the sooner we can start to live in peace and prosperity.

A few hours ago I moved my BTC from BTC-e to Kraken...I'll vote with my action. Kraken was a bit quiet in the past but I suspect that they are going to get a lot of business in the future. Even if it's just symbolic, it helps to drive home the message "Get audited or loose customers".

I can totally understand your point, these guys have lasted this long &amp; they are not looking too vulnerable yet....could they find a way to adapt in the aftermath of MtGox? Could it be that the winds of change are blowing and now we require more from our old favorite exchanges? I don't know all the answers but I sincerely hope BTC-e is part of our future.
Lets not forget, no one is asking for government imposed regulation, we are asking for voluntary self inspired action from these exchanges. The market will decide who survives in the long term, the market has changed and is now asking for more transparency.

Sounds like the exact thing we need here in Argentina...our demented government has placed all sorts of controls &amp; restrictions  on buying dollars. We actually are not allowed to just buy any foreign currency here, we have to fill out forms &amp; ask for permission, and 99.9% of the time you are denied the privilege.  With caution, I'm going to try it out, apparently Argentina is number one in South America in terms of it's use &amp; uptake of bitcoin. I can easily see Argentina as the perfect storm brewing for Bitcoin's rise .. we have a semi educated middle class that will never trust banks again after the corralito in 2002 when the government ceased all dollar deposits from people's bank accounts &amp; converted it to worthless pesos etc. I hope they don't succeed in trying to shut down this exchange, cause try they will. I get a feeling that given the history of this bi-polar government the coinmelon exchange would have been well prepared &amp; fortified against any government attacks. For starters I can see that it's a .com domain  &amp; not a .com.ar which would give them full control of the site. Feeling very hopeful :-) Would fight tooth &amp; nail to defend bitcoin against these totalitarian thieves.

I think you are referring to the lie called 'Democracy'....democracy is nothing more than a temporary transitional moment in time where 'mob rule' overrides 'LAW' &amp; division of powers between the executive, judicial &amp; legislative...'Mob rule' to Oligarchy' ..personally, I believe that a democratic republic is the best system with the best checks &amp; balances..it's never perfect, but for now it's what has worked.

I don't feel the need to 'serve' any 'masters'...do you? ...I'm only attempting to illustrate in very general terms, one view, one of many, on what may be the most realistic &amp; practical way to run a country without having to 'SERVE' anyone or any Government as you propose.

I think that to take what Andreas said as meaning '100% All banks are criminals' is to not understand Andreas. In the past I have also heard him say that there are some good banks that give good services. Sometimes we elevate people to much &amp; we put too much emphasis on their one liners like as if it was gospel. To me it makes total sense what he was implying, banks have developed some very nasty habits, some have even turned to criminal behavior, the majority are not acting in the best interests of the general public. Banking in general is not what it started out to be.

Hi, is the Colombian currency backed by anything else other than 'trust'? Gold? Silver? Just curious.

Today I moved my BTC from BTC-e to Kraken, I hope the message comes across in action...from everyone who can..."do an Audit or loose the trust of your customers"...maybe, just maybe, if we all do our own small bit, these guys get the message...egos aside, the question is: Can the actions of every individual make a difference? maybe.

Muchas gracias! Thank you :-)

Kraken was also one of the few exchanges that had the 'Malleability' fully accounted for. I have just moved my BTCs from BTC-e to Kraken. If only for symbolic purposes, I'm voting with my actions now and hopefully if others do the same this will send a message to all the other exchanges,..."get audited or loose customers" ..it's the new norm.

We as a whole, the community watches the 'watched' through cryptographic tech, like Andreas said, there's regulation alright, only that it's logarithmic in nature rather than corrupt humans in governments.

I concur wholeheartedly with you. Macri was a coward and essentially carried on with a totally  socialist agenda .  Even if he had wanted to challenge the 'deep state' peronists, the mafia was always ready to throw a spanner in the works at every turn,  there was no way out. I think this country needs a civil war in order to break free from the iron grip of these criminal$ in power.
