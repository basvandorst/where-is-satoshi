a 51% attack is really the only weakness I see. But then you come to an interesting conundrum... With that much control over the network, why would you fork the block chain and decimate the currency instead of monopolizing it?

I think you missed his point there bud.
4_auir - Forget about the damn price

Read his comment again. Forget about price. Bitcoin is an idea and a social experiment, if you aren't down with that don't get into it.

You are leaving out so much key information.
When capital gains rates have been higher in the past, they were offset by many tax write-offs. You could write off  interest on real estate, car loans, CREDIT CARDS....
You can no longer do any of that.
And the part about marginal tax rate not increasing for capital gains between 36,000 to 400k? Thats like Obama saying noone has to give up their healthcare, a flat-out LIE. I have consulted multiple CPAs, lets just say daddy isn't taking home nearly as much bacon as he should.
So spout off your talking points and make links.  boom. The only thing incorrect in my post was the 30% figure, I apologize.
You do NOT get a tax benefit for losing your investment. If you have other capital gains that earned, you can use the loss to reduce the taxes towards those gains. How the fuck is that a benefit? Why should someone risking 100% owned money subsidize the government when the government has no risk?
Real world lamens terms "You go flip a coin. If it is tails, you lose 100k. If it is heads, you win 80k. Gogo lets play!" -the government
Gee, what incentive!
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:34:56
The answer is clear and simple. You are doing a shit ton of analysis for no real reason.
Buy now. Hold. Wait for big changes in adoption/payment/regulation. Make moves then.
Who the hell would buy bitcoin just take it out and buy groceries and other everyday items? Bitcoin is in its infancy, not widespread enough for this to make any sense.
Same with day trading. At this point in time it isn't viable. You should be mining and holding, mining for others, coming up with new ideas for adoption etc, not buying tangerines and redbull or sending a steady stream of transactions through the shaky exchanges.

Explain it to them like this:
People freak out too much about market swings. "Traditional Economists" that try to apply prior, static knowledge to a completely new form of value exchange probably don't know what they're talking about. 
Day to day fluctuations of &gt;$500 or sometimes even up to 50% in Bitcoin really isn't that big of a deal because the market capital is still very small. Less than half a % of total global money. When the value of the dollar fluctuates (or even the stock exchange) there is minimal change in price because market cap is in the billions (or trillions).
However, Bitcoin is still subject to the same conditions large currency or stock exchanges experience (greed, panic selling, large investments/cashouts, govt intervention). The low market cap is the main reason (in my opinion) that these fluctuations are so high. 
BUT THEY REALLY ARENT! A 50% fluctuation in a 10 billion dollar market is only a 5 billion dollar change. A 5% change in a 100 billion dollar market is also a 5 billion dollar change. 5% swings aren't that uncommon.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:37:29
Here is my understanding. Non-techy
ASICs are just a type of computer chip. They hash more efficiently, but even an ASIC is just one computer connecting to the network.
A consolidated pool just means you are lending your single vote to a larger group. As a result, you increase your chances of solving the algorithm because you have more power working towards it. 
If you win, however, you will only receive a very small portion of the BTC, where as genesis users could connect with only a single computer and win each block chain because noone else was connecting to the network.

With the Market cap of bitcoin at over 12 BILLION dollars, there is no way that investing $600 MILLION dollars will give any entity a chance to fork the chain. Not going to happen.
If it were so easy, bitcoin would have been debunked long before it gained any value. Every day that passes makes a 51% attack more challenging. The only possibility of it comes with quantum computing which is yet to exist.

When people ask me how many bitcoin I have, I respond by asking how much money they have in their checking and savings accounts.
Most of the time, they say that is too personal, to which I respond "exactly"

My thoughts were that btc would be around 250 by the end of 2013, 1000 by 2016. Things are moving much quicker, though it can obviously fluctuate back down.
There are ALOT of behind the scenes things going on with bitcoin right now. I dont know if it will be 2 months, 6 months, or a couple years, but it won't surprise me to see bitcoin above 10,000 by 2023

I have an interesting opinion on market cap that doesn't exactly pertain to "being wiped out":
People freak out too much about market swings. "Traditional Economists" that try to apply prior, static knowledge to a completely new form of value exchange probably don't know what they're talking about. 
Day to day fluctuations of &gt;$500 or sometimes even up to 50% in Bitcoin really isn't that big of a deal because the market capital is still very small. Less than half a % of total global money.

I bought about 8 months ago. Guru friend told me he was very confident they would be at least $250 by the end of 2013, greater than $1,000 by 2018
I think things are happening more quickly than anticipated. 
Also, it may "crash" again but is never going to flatline. They will continue to trend up many years coming.
If you can afford to invest, why not do it? It's just money, and you can be a part of something revolutionary

I am digging your analysis, I do think you are a bit over-skeptical however.
The big talk about how easy it would be to mount a 51% attack... just isn't accurate at all. Other than that, you obviously know more about bitcoin/economics than the average person. Rock on.
