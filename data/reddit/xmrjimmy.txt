There is no fixing. BTC is built to be transparent on the blockchain. This does have benefits but never will it be private, anonymous or untraceable. BTC is non-fungible. Just have a quick search of the hundreds of people who've had their coinbase accounts shut down because of tainted coins.

Not secure, private or untraceable. Backdoor access has been approved by the developers. It is also centralized as a company so if for example the FBI or any agency/company puts enough pressure on this group it can be compromised. This is impossible with Monero because it is truly open-source and decentralized.

That's just not true. That property is called fungibility and bitcoin is not fungible. Bitcoins that have been used for gambling, purchase of illegal items, gambling etc. can be locked up if the entity e.g. Coinbase, deems it tainted. Therefore 1BTC doesn't always equal 1BTC as some are clean and some are tainted. One can also view your entire Blockchain history, your account balance and who and from where your BTC is being transacted. The only coin which is truly fungible and private is Monero.

Your issue in this scenario is law enforcement, government agencies or anyone with blockchain analysis capabilities (hint: I can see your entire bitcoin wallet information with your address)

After watching this video I bought more Monero.

@_date: 2018-09-02 20:40:12
how do you think the two correlate? is there any way that BOTH situations present a bullish move? Or does this 100k+ bitcoin movement present only a bearish scenario?
Very very strange things happening right now.
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:58:58
Are these bitcoins in any way associated with the Silk Road? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 09:41:39


This is the best strategy to have at this point. It is not Circa 2012 so just buy 25(insert fiat denomination) worth a week till the May 2020 halving.

I'd also recommend a book titled Barren Metal:  A History of Capitalism as the Conflict between Labor and Usury by E. Michael Jones

Is that 900USD per Ounce?
Do you think a drop to this price is realistic? It seems to be down at the moment but is still above 1200USD

These are all just guesses but it very well could happen when you think about how many Bitcoins will be left: roughly 16-18million. 
Demand will surely increase unless something catastrophic happens whilst at the same time the supply will drastically decrease from 12.5 to 6 every 10 minutes. By all logic this should send the price up parabolic-ally as it has done every time in the past.

By way of a username is no comparison to the toxic levels that I am referring to e.g. Twitter/YouTube spamming and shilling. I shouldn't have to make this clear I thought anyone with some common sense would understand.

I was under the impression that my Bitcoin is insured if it is stored on Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:28:55
Realistically, is my Bitcoin safe on Coinbase?

They are ignorant plain and simple. There is too much tribalism in crypto which is hilarious to see but this will become very sad in the upcoming years when the majority of alts will fail. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:08:03
Does this mean less fees also?  
Does anyone know the current fee rate? Isn't it 3.X&amp; ? This compounds to a shit ton over time.

Once studying the technical aspects of bitcoin, in order to gain a further understanding, you begin to realize it is already the global universal payment standard. This means no matter when or where I am on this globe, I have the ability to send value in the form of Bitcoin which is the highest level of trust payment method whereby the possibility for errors is virtually zero. 
Overtime I think the value will continue to fluctuate when comparing it to fiat currencies but 1 bitcoin will always remain as 1 bitcoin - this will never change. The hard cap of 21 million coins in conjunction with a predicted increase in demand suggests the value will continue to rise. I really think it is more risky not holding bitcoin than it is to purchase bitcoin as an investment. Comparing it to fiat currency aside, I think it is important to own bitcoin for diversifying your wealth. We live in uncertain times where nations are facing bubbling unrest and technology seems to be cementing its place in our world. This is not a get rich quick scheme which is at the forefront of the majority of people's minds on this topic. This is about power. Bitcoin = Power.

Share this with as many people as you possibly can. This is a fight won by information. The more bitcoins you can keep away from their hands the more power is retained. This is classic market manipulation to increase their holdings because they know it is a threat to their institutions.

There's no excuse for ignorance.
Take your bitcoins off coinbase and into your own wallet. GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND.

There will come a time where they will have no choice but to learn. Better start now and be prepared rather than later. For the ones who it doesn't apply to then disregard because the post wasn't aimed at them. Carry on. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:29:14
Thats true, this is why information is key.   
The more coins held throughout the world, distributed in a decentralized manner. The greater the success. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:02:13
Or manipulate the general public, as if that has never happened before or out the realms of possibility right?

He doesn't know a single line of code and isn't in any way knowledgeable about the tech industry. This is a man who bases all of his investments on inherent value which doesn't apply to crypto right now.

I find it terrifying how large the amount of support/anticipiation there is in favour of ETF's. If you haven't understood how the SEC, Financial Institutions and Governments manipulate these investment vehicles then you really need to go back and understand the purpose and ideology behind Bitcoin.  
Tldr: SEC will open the door for more manipulation. Just like the Future derivatives did.
