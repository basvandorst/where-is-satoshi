Have a nice Memorial Weekend.  From the sound of things, you could use one  :)

Consumers want alternatives -- who are they kidding?

Perhaps, but he obviously has some knowledge about how things work having worked at the Mint.
@_date: 2014-05-23 23:26:20
Ok, but what is your knowledge about the guy in question.  How do you know what knowledge he possesses?  On what basis can you dismiss him?
@_date: 2014-05-24 01:20:24
You are the one making a big deal out of this.  The article put him on the pedestal -- I'm just a reader.   I could really care less.
@_date: 2014-05-23 22:25:47
LOL. Endless tirade because I assumed the gentleman at the mint might know something about the place he worked.  Ok, Mr. Smart guy, let's see your academic credentials... first.

Certainly, we dont want to see the web turn into something like cable tv.  On the other hand, innovation is going to continue and you dont want that curtailed.  There are clauses in the new regulations which have exceptions, and you are likely to see a different kind of fast line from another technical pov from the likes of Google, Apple and Amazon.  Since a lot of the bandwidth used is from Hollywood product, why shouldnt Hollywood be allowed to have fast lanes that work at preventing piracy?

If you look closely, what's really happening is a war between silicon valley and the ISPs for the future of the web.  It's a complicated issue but regulations should not curtail the possibilities of future innovation.

What do they charge you at Fed-X or UPS?  I love the USPO

Right.  And there is nothing to stop business to business relationships, although the FCC can look at the business deals now, should the regs pass the lawsuit stages.  Some of the tech people have characterized Net Neutrality as whether or not the web would be subsidized or not

3) You mean the risk of the bankers. The property owners in the US got screwed as well as a lot of people's retirement funds. And a lot of people found themselves unemployed as a result of their actions.

I have no evidence whatsoever.  Given his interest in social programs and based upon what his friends have said, it seems a very odd fit

The writer at Ars Technica said the blame squarely falls on the defense attorney.  Given the strange defense strategies --  e.g. Stuart Little did it, etc, I buy that.
They are going to appeal.  Can they use the illegal seizure as a defense this time around?

Whose employment perspective and who is "we."  When the crash hit, people stopped hiring across the board and hoarded their money.   To suggest that all the people who were laid off, or lost consulting jobs weren't needed anyway is ridiculous and insensitive and moronic.    Since when does globalization determine whether or not one should have a standard of living?   The law may not provide for civil or criminal liability as written, but that is besides my point.

According to Ars Technica, the defense screwed up.  A copy of the server in Iceland was done illegally.  Had the defense pushed that point, the government's case would have had to fold.
"Yet how the FBI discovered the server in the first place remained a mystery: it was presented as effectively a gift from God. And when the FBI finally had to reveal this mystery, they didn’t. To put it politely, the FBI response was inconsistent with reality. Others have been more blunt, calling it “lying” and “gibberish.” And it is the FBI’s own evidence, provided to the defense, that shows that the FBI effectively lied in the court filing detailing server discovery.
Every shred of evidence except for two “hey, I found this site” posts derives solely from the server seizure. Now apparently an IRS investigator had found these two posts before the server was discovered, but these posts wouldn’t sustain a search warrant of Ulbricht’s gmail account, let alone an arrest warrant for Ulbricht. So if the defense could get the blatantly illegal search of the server tossed, the defendant could walk away.
But in any case, the moment the judge wrote that “Defendant has, however, brought what he must certainly understand is a fatally deficient motion to suppress,” the good ship Revenge was sunk. And this is the point where the defense turned to farce."

Everybody has ups and downs.  This experience will only make you stronger. Most successful people fail more than they succeed.   You will recover eventually and prosper.
