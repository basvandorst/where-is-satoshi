With current laws? Would be really hard to do, and prove mind you. By your measure, why amend any laws? It's all there! 
It's pretty clear that you assume that any regulation is 'bad.' Yeah, there is no nuance with you... No point in furthering discussion when I have 0 knowledge to gain from you.

salty BTC owners hating on Doge 
what else is new in this dying subreddit
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:59:47
except I thought this issue isn't really related to the bitcoin protocol but 3rd party exchanges? 
isn't this akin to the early days of the internet where there were a bunch of shitty sites and personal homepages before e-commerce really took off ? i just can't help but think that over time exchanges will become more robust.

Thanks for this. Will check it out!

there are already multitudes of exchanges already open 
and the usual bitstamp, btc-e, coinbase, etc
and quite a few exchanges that got hacked or the owners of said 'exchanges' ran with the dough.

I think you need to read the law yourself.the fact that you simplify fraud = illegal without giving any nuance is very telling. 
stealing teslas has to do with theft laws BTW... your analogies are borderline cringe
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:03:02


how would this be done? just wondering.
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:43:57
fraud implies that there are laws in place to prosecute this kind of activity. 
AFAIK there are no laws that prosecute fraud based on Cryptos. I've been asking from you to provide some semblance of a law that prosecutes fraud based on Cryptos. you haven't still. because there are none.
sorry but its you who does not get it.

would love for the exchanges to be regulated

The mysterious circumstances surrounding 'Satoshi Nakamoto' is a clear hallmark of intelligence-agency backing. 
I'm pretty confident that Bitcoin was created by a team of researchers, funded by the cryptocracy (shadow government) that exists.

Yes you are right that Bono is on the in with the elites. Just by association you know he is well connected. Hanging out with Clinton doing tours with the Clinton Global Initiative (just another PR ridden organization meant to usurp more power) 
I'd also say that bitcoin is a creation from the cryptocracy that is guiding this growing global civilization (as well as past civilizations).

You didn't supply anything. The fact that you failed to give specifics is very telling... I called you out on it. That's all. 
Sorry, but giving a link without explaining it just makes it look worst on your part. And again, you failed to give a specific statute/law from the link you provided. Fail.
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:47:59
Yeah. You have no idea what you're talking about. 
Failed to answer the question as well with specifics. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 18:35:37
illegal? 
so how are the folks that opened up fraudulent exchanges going to be prosecuted without any regulations in place? 
care to elaborate how it's illegal on their part stealing crypto currencies?
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:06:25
incredibly well done!
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:45:16
I feel as though exchanges can be easily manipulated with. Also, how do we make sure that exchanges are being fair? There should be something in place to keep exchanges in check. 
There are also reports of certain high volume traders not receiving BTC properly on Cryptsy. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:51:36
.... that has absolutely nothing to do with cryptos and exchanges. 
it's related to making false statements/representation. also, the corrupt exchanges aren't making false statements/representations at all. they're setting up shop and closing shop the moment they have a lot of coins. 
seriously, you are a collosal failed armchair analyst who assumes he knows 'the law.' There are lawyers with 30+ years of experience and they still don't have full grasp of the law. But of course man, 'you know law' like you implied earlier. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:08:42
Care to answer that yourself? All you did was provide a list of laws. Please be more specific. Also, from briefly looking at it there is no mention of virtual/digital currencies, nor it's relationship with exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:30:06
did I ever say that? 
you're so verbose but failed to answer my questions. scroll above and see if you can answer them.
how do you prosecute fraud from cryptos when there are no laws in place to combat fraudulent activity?
@_date: 2014-02-19 18:57:05
so how do you take owners of various minor exchanges to court? 
what specific law are they breaching ?
how would you prosecute exchanges that are based all over the world? 
a lot easier said than done to prosecute people for 'fraud'
