I really don't think that the transaction cost is that high and even if it were, Bitcoin is still in it's very early stages and I am actually surprised and amazed at how well Bitcoin has done considering that it was the first. I am very hopeful about lightning network and other technological improvements that will help Bitcoin slowly evolve into a mature crytocurrency rather that try and fix all the issues today to reduce transaction fees. 
Now that I think about it why would someone want to use Bitcoin for small transactions? Aren't there hundreds if not thousands of coins that can do micro transaction at negligible cost better than Bitcoin or Bitcoin cash? If I were to be doing a transaction of a hundred thousand dollars, I would be okay paying a hundred dollars in transaction cost. Considering the market cap of Bitcoin, I really do not want those small transactions on Bitcoin network. Interesting comparison would what would be the transaction cost on BCH when it reaches market cap of around $500. Will it still be feasible to have small transactions using BCH??
I hold both Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash and I don't see why both of them cannot coexist in harmony. Why does it have to be one versus other when both of these currencies have different value proposition. Bitcoin has tested against time and has been open to all the attacks everyday and still standing strong. That stability is a damn good value proposition to me.

This is what gives me so much confidence in Bitcoin. Everytime Bitcoin goes down and people spread fud, Bitcoin has always comeback stronger. I am a hodler with whatever small amount of Bitcoin that I have. Long live BTC Long live Crypto ��

All my transactions to buy stickers from blockstream on old wallet failed. Is anybody able to buy anything using lightning payments on eclair wallet? I tried with 1 channel, multiple channels etc to some popular nodes on mainnet explorer. Am I doing something wrong?
