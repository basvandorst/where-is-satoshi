The term "Tainted Coins" is often misinterpreted as a measure of provenance. That's understandable considering the traditional definition of the word "tainted" coupled with the reality that many Bitcoins actually have been used for what would be considered nefarious purposes by standard societal norms. In fact, it is a common occurrence to be holding or trading Bitcoins that have traveled dark roads. The only coins that have absolute clean history are freshly mined coins, and much of that enters the wild pretty quickly so does not stay "clean" for long. So while it is tempting to compare tainted coins to a $100 bill that has either been used to pay for narcotics or used to actually ingest narcotics by way of a rolled up straw, this is not what "tainted coins" are in Bitcoin vernacular.
In the jargon of the science of Bitcoin, tainted refers to something that's not only counter intuitive to the definition of the term "tainted", but it's actually a fairly confusing (and boring) concept. In this case of Bitcoins, taint is simply a measure of correlation between two (wallet) addresses. The variable expressed as taint is primarily used to express this wallet connection.
To make things even less intuitive, ALL Bitcoin addresses which have received a payment, ever, are "tainted". Taint in no way effects the value or fungibility of any coin since it is not a measure of any negative characteristic that would be associated with the traditional definition of "tainted". Actually, there is a serious problem if all your coins do not have some level of taint

I’ve used paxful to purchase a large portion of my bitcoin and I’ve never had a problem with any of the sellers.

You can make an offering as a vender on paxful and people will see your offer for bitcoin in exchange for giftcards

Bitcoin has fruad protection, except instead of a company protecting you, you have to protect yourself. I don’t know if you have ever heard of this but wallets have seeds that you need to access the wallet without that seed you can’t get access to the wallet, they also have keys that you need to put in to access the wallet. It’s your responsibility to protect these so someone doesn’t get access to them

Try paxful, you can purchase bitcoin with giftcards however there are some heavy fees on giftcards, sometimes there are good deals with western union and the fees on that are usually around 4% which is pretty good but with the western union you have to purchase over $500 worth of bitcoin to have low fees

I’ve done it on paxful before, it works great however the fees are quite high, you don’t have to worry about anyone scamming you though I’ve done over 100 deals there and never been scammed

Explain to him that when you have paypal, it isn’t your money. If PayPal thinks your account is suspicious then they can close it out of no where and take all your money without a notice. This is rare and will not happen to most people, however it happened to me when i had nearly $1500 in my balance and PayPal put my account on hold, they required a bank statement and when I submitted one they completely closed my account, fortunately I received a check for the money 6 months later. With bitcoin, there is no company telling you how to use or spend your money, you’re the only person that can say where you want to spend it and how you want to spend it.

I wish it can go back to 8k so I can buy some more but I don’t think it will go down much but only time will tell
@_date: 2019-06-04 10:18:45
That’s a horrible idea there would be a huge amount of fees for such small transactions, it’s better to just buy $100 every month

The war on drugs is a complete failure. It’s been going on for decades and will continue to go on until the end on mankind. As long as humans exist, drugs will also exist. The only way of getting rid of the dark web and organized crime is by legalizing all drugs and letting people choose what to do with their bodies

Buy what exactly, it seems like there’s 2 type of people that buy bitcoin number one is cyber criminals and number 2 is “investors”I don’t see any other reason why anyone would use it

Fair enough, rumor has it that eBay is going to let users  pay with crypto currency in the near future. Hopefully this causes a trend for businesses to accept crypto.
