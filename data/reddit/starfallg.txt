This is exactly the reason that mainstream economics advocate mildly inflationary monetary policy. In deflation, people tend to halt spending. They tend to opt for a bigger portion of a smaller pie. It's just human nature that Bitcoin can't change.

A store of value is not the same as how much a single unit is worth. Bitcoin's volatility is higher than most penny stocks. Even blue-chip stocks are not considered as store of value. Prices for a commodity must be relatively stable in the short term to be a useful store of value. Bitcoins' value can fluctuate wildly several times a day. We're talking about 30-40% shifts, not the 1-2% shifts for normal fiat currencies. Furthermore, Bitcoins recent exponential growth and adoption has not decreased this volatility, so there is no real timeframe on when we can depend on Bitcoin as a store of value.

Read it again.
He said that they created a public pending transaction list because of invalid transactions caused by this "fix" which they failed to apply. It was this transparency  that made the problem worse for Gox as now the attackers had a public list of invalid transactions to target.

mtgox crash protection just kicked in. The data feed is going in loops again.

Bitstamp is having continuing problems with site availability.
BTC-E is crashing for some reason - BTC/USD down to 403.

The BTC China chart is from today?

This looping issue reared its head several times since. It is most definitely an issue with Gox having some sort of inbuilt loop that freezes trading.
The exact same issue happened for the above episode not too long ago.
Now for April, I don't know the real story behind what happened, but MtGox is not instilling confidence here. If there is a halt in trading due to crash protction, then why won't they tell us about it.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:46:33
Gosh! Why does this only occur when there is a big selloff?? Hum.. let me see.. maybe it's the inbuilt crash protection they built in their exchange platform! Gox is frozen at $877 because that's when the crash protection kicked in.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:31:28
It's not a bug silly. It is obvious they halted trading as somebody put through a big sell order.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:51:29
btcchina may break under 5100, broke under 5200 just 10mins ago..
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:47:41
The actual rate is around 3% for credit card transactions and interest lost.
For debit card transactions, it is significantly lower and you usually get payments back into your account quicker. However, the fees vary a lot more.

"With no clear news driver, Bitcoin prices have dropped over 20% from their overnight highs - trading at around $715 now."
That guy is completely clueless. Probably still glued to his bloomberg terminal or reuters feed.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:43:18
So you think it will continue rising until the next mega DDOS, or Silk Road 2 gets busted?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:52:20
It stopped falling as MtGox has just halted trading. There is somebody with a lot of coins on Gox that wants out. Will be a lot of uncertainly in the next few hours.

Yes, Bitstamp is down and BTC China has crashed to 3500 (but rebouding as we speak).
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:50:14
Bitstamp looks very bad in this. The ticker has come back in the past 30 mins, and the price has gone up on the ticker, but trade volume is very low. In the meantime, no-one can login to cancel their limit buys. What's going on here?
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:59:09
What a stupid argument. The whole idea that bitcoin has value is that it can be used (because after all it is not tangible like gold or silver and has no industrial or other use). If bitcoin is allow allow to be used for trading, then it will fail.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:48:09
Do you even check BTCChina charts? It was crashing about the same time as Gox.
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:44:12
Looks like Gox froze his account for now. Is this a good thing or not?
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:48:03
We're not talking about long term BTC trends. Just recognising when a crash may happen so people on here can get out in time (and back in after the speculators flee).
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:20:16
Depends on the preparation you do before it is deposited into the originating exchange. If they can hire mules to smuggle cash, they can do it for opening a BTC China account.
The house trick is different as you are seeking official approval, it will come from your officials account and you would need to explain that.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:03:32
If it were me, I would have wanted to buy in at 85 instead of 266 back in April. So, yes, it does make a massive difference.
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:00:19
Can't even login to bitstamp - internal server error after trying to punch in user/pass. Looks like people are having problems canceling their buy limit orders and/or putting in new sell orders.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:00:12
A lot of the upwards pressure is coming from China. There's quite a lot of unkowns there. Speculation is second nature in Chinese markets. The big question is if there will be more positive press leading to an influx of fresh bitcoin investors, or will there be a official response (maybe crackdown) to this speculation.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:32:37
The data feed is replaying old trades! It doens't take a genius to figure that one out. They halted trading cuz of a big selloff.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:37:58
I don't know if it will, but the resemblance just occurred to me when I was on btcchina.com earlier as well.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:02:04
I think most early investors in bitcoin has a long term holding and also a portion of their portfolio that they trade more often. In fact, this is important in a market to help keep the price equilibrium grounded in reality.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:06:40
There are many different ways. One way is to send kids overseas for Uni. Then they can use that excuse to buy a property to house them. This requires a lot of planning and also connections disorder to get approval. It's also useless for dirty cash.
Another way is mules. There are mules that are employed to smuggle out RMB to Hong Kong for sale on the open market.
I can go on and on, but BTC is a relatively cheap and quick way to do it. The problem right now is the volatility.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:29:36
The reason for the price difference between BTCChina and Bitstamp is because it is easy to take money out of Bitstamp (to outside of China). It's the same reason for the spread between MTGox and Bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:59:38
mtgox has cooldown protection kicking in. Trading is halted and the feeds are replaying old transacitons.

btcchina is breaking below 5200 soon. Looks like china is driving the downward spiral this time..
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:34:13
It's a trading halt. Crash protection has kicked in. Isn't that obvious? It happened last time somebody tried to offload a few millions worth of BTC as well.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:47:11
Btcchina just broke under 5200. Things are getting interesting.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:34:22
Gold, by itself, is useful. People make blingy things out of it. It is used extensively in industry due to its chemical properties. Some people even eat it.
None of that can be done with Bitcoins. The only way BTC is worth money is if people use it one way or another.
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:01:20
China has strict financial controls as it has instituted capital controls on RMB. Money  flow out of the country is strictly regulated to ensure that the RMB (and the economy) does not crash. The side effect of this is that when the music stops, most likely China will hit a hard landing which it's political institutions may not survive.
This is what the west is banking on and what China has been working very hard to prevent.
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:03:29
It looks more like a tactic to delay the rate of fall. It could lead to a feedback loop though (like mtgox back in April).
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:12:13
Bitcoin wasn't the glimmering hope for them against government control. It was a vehicle for them to move money overseas and more importantly - to speculate. The Chinese have been conditioned to not ask questions on politics, so they simply find ways around the problem, rather than risking everything to try fix them.
There is a reason why Macau is now bigger than Vegas. Mainland Chinese love to gamble but there are not that many avenues for them to bet on things inside the mainland. Similarly, investments opportunities are tightly regulated and Bitcoins allows them to bet on a high-risk commodity freely. That's the reason why Bitcoin was so popular, and this led the government to clamp down on it.

Gox broke the crash this time, not caused it. It's not April anymore and Gox has automatic crash protection.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:25:10
Because of capital controls in China prohibiting export of money, rich business people (and communist party government officials) need to find ways to keep money outside China.
This is to allow them to -
1. Funnel out money that was illegally gained in China (eg. corruption).
2. Escape China if they are subject to any sort of criminal or political investigation
3. Buy and speculate on property overseas.
4. Escape China easily if there is political turmoil in general.
5. All of the above.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:30:45
Looks like the graph is fresh off the BTC China site today..
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:13:01
You're comparing apples to bananas. This is only comparable to the projected number of bitcoins in circulation. These charts measure units, not of price per unit (which is a measure of projected value), which is the only measure relevant to our discussions when talking about whether there is a bubble or not.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:41:16
Mtgox should just come out and admit they have a crash protection system that kicks in. It's obvious to everyone anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:38:08
880-&gt;750 on Gox and bitstamp right now and falling.. looks like a bull trap...
