Seems so. Can't even find it under developer options.. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:03:50
Perhaps Bitcoin will evolve into being the new gold standard. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:41:54
I get neither. 
Running Android 6.0 on an Acer Zest Plus. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:25:43
Clicked the link for the apk, and it got downloaded as a txt file.. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:57:35
Yeah, can't even find it in developer options to enable download from somewhere else.. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:44:32
As I wrote, I cannot find the option to download from third party sources IN developer options. 
They are enabled. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:42:52
[nope](  
And the file is 61.97mb..
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:25:33
Lol. Ok. It showed me the number if bits, not the comma version. I thought I had more. 5 dollars ain't nothing to cry about.. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:59:59
Never got that far before the SD-card broke.
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:54:27
I have no more coins.. Should I ever get ahold of new ones, I will certainly keep them at Xapo for as long as I can. Easier, better and safer for me.
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:58:12
It was confirmed yesterday, so shit out of luck there.
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:41:42
And again. I have the address the money was sent to. That information is worth nothing..?
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:51:02
There is nothing in the wallet after I had to reinstall the app, so no need for legder. I give up altcoins.
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:36:56
Im not limber enough to do that. darum-pcch!
@_date: 2016-12-30 11:25:45
I believe in myself, but not the part of about being financially responsible. That part is fucked up.
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:27:07
This will be interesting. 
Shall my faith in humanity get a little reborn..? 
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:47:19
Jeah. There wont be a next time for me. It is still to vulnerable to mistakes like this. 
And again, who could have known the fuckin SD-card would break 20min into using it for the first time. Fuck shit, dick-pick.
@_date: 2016-11-30 13:55:29
Viagra.. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:53:45
Jeah. Everyone tells me this. Again, and again, who would have fuckin guessed the SD-card would break after 20 fuckin minutes. Sheesh. No more, no point. I give up coins. Its not worth it.
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:50:15
Jeah. Too late. I am broke as fuck, and cannot afford to buy. So im done with this until there might be other (better) protocols in place to protect retards like myself.
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:37:06
It did not ask me for any seed words. I opened the app, copied the address and sent them over.  Little did I know the SD-card would crash before I could do so.
Oh well. I have previously misplaced my Doge-coins and Litecoins (fram paper wallets) as well. So Ill take the universes hint and give up this altcoin business until dizzy-heads like me have some more protection against our own stupidity.
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:52:55
I`ve learned to give up. It is the third time it has happened, the other two are misplaced doge and litecoin paper wallet. I am done.
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:55:18
Yup. Lesson learned.
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:45:49
Hello. Here is the adress I sent to - 	1PtzDYxgimjxzoMGwE4GWrX16SavcBAgMt It says in Xapo the transaction is completed.

Thank you for this well educated reply.
I use ES-file explorer (bought and paid for), I go into /Android/data/ but I cannot find com.mycelium there, eventhough the app is reinstalled on my phone. Probably since I have not created a new wallet there yet. I am afraid if I do so will definetly wipe the part of the SD-card if it is still there.
I bought my phone yesterday, and I have terrible experience with rooting. The only phone I ever managed to root is the N5. Everything I have had after, nope, nope, nope. So I am afraid to try this.
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:36:33
Little under half a coin. Not much really, but I live hand to mouth and cant afford to buy. Eitherway, I dont care anymore. It is lost. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:54:49
I am.
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:51:09
Oh well. Fuck.
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:58:45
I am a retard. As mentioned. I have also misplaced paperwallets for lite and dogecoin. I am clearly not fit for this.
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:38:16
It did not ask me for anything. Although I should have known. Oh well. Retards like me obviously does not deserve taking part in the future.
@_date: 2016-11-10 19:43:42
Slow your roll there, mister. I got my tip today. As you point out. Literally thousands commented. This is one person, presumably with a life, job ect. Give it some time. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:35:30
A quick google gives me the standard root options with android DB drivers and what not. I have tried installing these in the past on win10 and they never get installed correctly. I have been in the settings, the register ect to try and get it right with many hours trouble searching and googling to no avail. 
There is also the one click root option, that hasnt worked in the past neither. I simply am not tech savy enough to do it.
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:47:30
Pure and plain stupidity. Reading on about how important it is to have in "on your person" ect. I never have had issues with Xapo, so simply a stupid decision. I bought a new phone, and in my excitement fucked up. Not unheard of..
@_date: 2016-12-30 11:12:35
Why would that make me feel better? I do not revel in others misfortune, only my own.
That does suck for you though.
@_date: 2016-10-31 18:26:31
Brilliant. Thank you! 
A node I will consider down the line after my company turns a profit. :-)
@_date: 2016-10-31 16:00:35
Thank you for the Bitpay tip. I am have started my own business, and now you saved me a days work of looking for a decent bitcoin payment provider. So now I have all three options available. Bitcoin, PayPal and Fiat. Where to turn for lite coin then? Maybe even doge and ethereum? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:06:13
There is now.
@_date: 2016-10-31 16:11:33
True. I'm just afraid I'll loose track of it. Hm. Maybe I'll put up a separate computer/server for that. And ask customers to send some proof of purchase or what not on email. Something to connect to the balance on the account. Not sure how to do this. 
Oh well, brick by brick my mansion is rising. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 18:24:47
That much I know. It was more to keep it safe at home, and not on the computer I drag with me all over the place.
