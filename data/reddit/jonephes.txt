Also the sellers who are selling at this low, have absolutely have to have no idea how btc works or how many will ever be made. Right now we are at 80 to 85 percent mined. Out of 21 million total btc that will be made. There will never be 21 mil btc made, counting all lost etc. So be it as what it will be, there is only really only a small amount of btc that will ever exist. In comparison to any other crypto "token" that is out there its ridiculous to sell it at all if you mined. If you are playing the trading game good luck lol.

There are people who has shit tons of btc they mined. Why if you mined would you sell now lol. Plus anyone who bought at the previous highs even at 13k or 12k there is no point in selling either it will go up. Just check what btc was two years ago and one year ago. Its laughable to sell at what its going now. If i had funds to buy i would buy the shit out of it now.

These charts and analysis mean nothing, these people are basing their analysis on watching stocks. The tools they are using to watch btc is based on stock trading. Sit back and hodl and watch the chaos of no one knowning anything. Cause they dont. You can have a guess about what is going to happen and that doesnt mean it will. One thing you know for sure there will only ever be 21 mil btc made so if you can get some of the 21 mil you better do it now.
