This kind of an attack is inevitable. If bitcoin starts threatening the big players in the legacy system, they can print as much money as is needed and take losses that would seem eye-watering to any of us, and write it off as a cost of doing business.

You are supposed to supply your own btc address, but I forgot to. I don't know where the one associated with my profile came from.

Hah! Predicting the downfall of bitcoin because he is unsure if we can trust a trustless decentralised network? Presumably implying that the JP Morgue is *more* trustworthy than a set of open-source mathematical protocols? What utter horse manure that spews from this mans face hole.

No. I've HODL'd my way through the past 3 bubbles. I love that feeling, becuase I get to HODL even more coins next time around! ;)

Just trying to spread the joy of HODL'ing to one and all!

Bought 3 GPU's from CoinsForTech. Have to say, I am extremely happy with the service and I will definitely be back.

Glad that the dev is working on profile edit feature. I forgot to enter my bitcoin address and it must have created one for me that I do not have control over. Dev should make the bitcoin field a mandatory form element.

Stupid story. Not even remotely believable. Downvoted.

Ha! This is awesome.

HA! No, it is not a 'currency' like the US dollar or the EURO. It is SOUND MONEY, like gold or silver. Precious metals no longer are considered 'currency' anymore by central bankers - why? Because they want us all to use their paper IOUs! pfft... this crap is fooling nobody. Use this opportunity to fill your boots with cheap coins - they will not be this cheap for long.

i think, this.

This is the key point! Haha. So long bankers, hope you have put away some bitcoin for yourselves before the bondpocalypse wipes out the wealth you have stolen from the people of the world, out once and for all.

That even with the recent flurry of media attention, bitcoin is still relatively unknown. So the demand globally remains quite weak, yet the price still is getting driven up. Essentially, it is telling you that you are going to be very rich in 5 years.
