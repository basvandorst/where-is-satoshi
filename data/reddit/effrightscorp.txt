You know you're in too deep when you have dreams involving gdax, bittex, and binance, then you wake up at 5:00 needing to compulsively check all the prices and maybe make an arbitrage trade or two. Coinbase / GDAX lost 30 LTC of mine in between the two exchanges last Saturday and I've been sleeping so well while waiting for support to get back to me and make things right

Mine know because I usually keep price tickers around while I'm working and sometimes I'll day trade a bit on break / if I'm waiting on something to finish running

Mine should be 100k but whoever 'upped' my limits put 50k in, which was my limit already...

God damnit, your post made me check the price and instantly regret I didn't double down after it dropped six months ago. I bought 5 at the advice of a guy selling drugs over the internet, regretted it almost instantly (price had shot up to 15/eth, I bought it, it dropped to 12 and hovered there or lower after), and have been annoyed with myself over it until a week ago when I first realized it was jumping up thanks to a thread here

If you leave your Bitcoin on an exchange, then you're trusting the exchange to keep it safe. Look Kat the Mt Gox fiasco to see why it's generally a bad idea to store on exchanges long term

I took a lot of crypto advice from guys selling steroids on the internet, and they have yet to steer me too far off course. For example, I bought ETH at 15$, NEO (when it was still Antshares) at 8$, and Sia at 0.015$ (though in that case I wish I waited until it ate shit and dropped to 0.003$, took around 4-5 months to break even on that buy).
