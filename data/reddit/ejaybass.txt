By the way, bank accounts are free too. And a lot easier to handle than problematic wallets with hacks every week. Too complicated. Still.. Blockchain has enormous potential in case of business applications. But not for everyday payments..

The "fee" argument is old and not accurate anymore. In Germany there are almost no fees to zero fees for ages, concerning money transactions. And that applies to most European countries too. It may be an argument for oversea transactions but that is also not really a big point anymore with PayPal and so on. Again perhaps for companies and huge transactions. I think the upside is only the fact that it is a "new gold" type of thing. Who will really pay with btc? What is the real benefit of paying a consumer good with btc? I haven't paid a single cent of fees for ages whenever I bought something online or in stores... Cash, credit card, PayPal, money wire. So?

Of course there are different options.. But still.. Sounds like it can't be "legal" to dictate customers how to spend their money. It is not even a law regulation. Just a company basically

I smell fear from several banks :) Someone wants a piece of the cake. Disallowing customers to spend their money as they want it... sounds very "dictatorship" like... Is that even legal??
