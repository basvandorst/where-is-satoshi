@_date: 2018-01-19 04:56:12
Thank you for everything Greg. Cryptoing ain't easy!

Casascius coins are one of the first  brass physical bitcoins  (Bitbills was the first ever), . A real treasure in bitcoin history. Mike has discontinued production so the are getting more scarce.

 The guy found a bug. He should get some donations to send a msg to developers that are out there to help each other no matter what camp you are from. Just my two satoshi!
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:23:50
Nice work guys keep building!
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:24:34
Roger ver is trying to divide bitcoin. He wants a hard fork because he feels that his vision his the only forward  because he was an early adopter so what. Good point on Blockchain info it is supporting segwit. He needs to realize that title does not mean you know whats best. I am gonna trust core over ver nut job that has lost his satoshi marbles.
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:26:43
got mine from ebay
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:05:59
Real informative and to the point. Thank you
@_date: 2017-03-29 04:10:53
R.I.P Hal and thx for all the contribution you made.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:16:29
I can't wait to setup my segwit node. BU is  just  crap.
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:23:40
Ver is not the only big dog in the game. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:42:18
Never invest what you can't lose. I sold 10% when it was high but looking at long run. I hope BTC will shake off the drama but if it does not it was a great ride.
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:09:59
Thomas I am no Sherlock but Oliver shared it with one person for comment, and  he will find out who it is that leaked it ????? Maybe that person he shared it with. :-)
@_date: 2017-03-14 23:08:02
lol!!!!! have not laughed that hard in a while.
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:56:12
it is annoying before I ignored them, but when we have new users joining I do not want them to join the cesspool of rbtc. Specially when a lot of newcomers think bitcoin.com is the official site.
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:49:31
lol made my day!
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:08:56
I also have been into BTC for 4 years and I think what you have written is not a comprise at all. The other side is clearly unstable and toxic. We need to stop giving them atten. and find a way to activate UASF or segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-14 23:13:52
Hush let them figure it out for once!!
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:09:24
Please activate segwit!
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:04:11
the only way forward is segwit, The community  finally realizes  the problems with a BU.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:45:04
I will go with segwit as the future of bitcoin Alex for 1000.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:39:11
Best tweet yet! Activate segwit! The recent price drop was just the idea of a hardfork, just think if it occurred btc will be 400 and miners will pay.  I hope they do of course as hodlr I do not want price drp,  but if  it bleeds the miners then so be it . I am here for the long term . They have showed their hand and now it's time for the market to punish them!
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:51:17
I think someone crashed them.
@_date: 2017-03-29 04:34:31
I would like to see a UASF if it will make the miners come to the table because the price is not hurting them enough. Maybe if users started to switch it will scare them enogh.
@_date: 2017-03-29 03:29:32
Wow! I love the idea of getting some incentive for running a full node. Great work guys. I swear I love this sub because of articles like this. rbtc is full of self-absorbed personalities like roger. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:58:37
haha that has to be the dumbest idea. Who the hell cares about classic. Fork off!
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:25:20
I thought he sold most of his Ether. Mr. hardfork fool me once. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:53:33
Great video. He has been around computers longer than many of us on this forum and I like the historical competition of hardware and software. History does rhyme
@_date: 2017-01-28 02:19:56
Interesting article my parent and grandparents care more about holding gold. Me I look at the future and see magic internet money.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:45:53
New to this how do I trade my Bch for btc on shapeshift or any other website?
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:39:14
agree with starslab big blockers trying to drive the bigblocker narrative.
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:55:31
Don't be guilty at all my friend. :-). I bought 4 coins for 300 around mid 2013. The price dropped to 50 a coin and I gave up  on bitcoin for a year. I still think buying at this price is cheap compared to what it will be before the next having hodl.
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:48:40
take that crap to r/btc. Give a reasonable answer.Miners care about money that is why they mine for money. Segwit does not compensate them as much. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 22:04:53
Great video got a good laugh.
@_date: 2017-01-20 06:11:29
Also running two full nodes want to see segwit activated first as well. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:09:22
They need to manipulate to control. The 2 week old account or two day account was not working for them, was  too obvious.Mod the shit out of them. Tired of this crap. We need to go back to talking about how BTC is gonna help humanity. Instead we are here arguing with shills.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:40:16
This is an attack that I have not witnessed in a while. Only makes BTC stronger
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:15:42
Get on ETHER reddit and pump another scam ICO. Also if any issue comes up ask VITALIK to undo every thing, worked before.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:28:54
Man if you are starving and  22 dollars is not the answer. You need to get your priorities straighten out . Slow confirmation is the least of your worry. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:52:29
lol YOu are doing it right my friend!
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:08:23
I have a .032 btc not a lot to many but to me it is. Stuck there as well they will not respond to my e mails. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:09:19
lol BURN
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:33:06
It was a pretty large attack and I have been on reddit for past two years and have not seen one like it. The VINNY LINGHAM, Roger Ver , Jihan and many others spread fud to buy up cheap BTC. FUD,  FUD and then repeat old game yet the noobs do not see it. I was fooled buy Vinny with his shit civic coin promotion. Hey BTC is going down after the fork sell sell . To all the newcomers if people are telling you that BTC is going down is because they will buy your btc at a discounted price buy and HOLD.
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:29:11
Nice I think I will try to setup one like this.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:30:36
HODLOR_no one has was ever swiped right on you and you are still mad ehh.Go pay some one Bcash to swipe right for you all day. Shoot forgot  no one uses Bcash. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:45:16
Hey BashCo thx for fighting this FUD your job is not easy and a lot of hard work.
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:21:44
Great work! lol made my day.
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:47:27
Ver has been supporting purse for a while now. Surprised that he had nothing to do with the funding.
@_date: 2017-04-06 05:28:44
You sir have shook up the Bitcoin world! Thank You for looking out for BTC Mr. Maxwell. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 05:24:18
Can anyone from BU exploit segwits vulnerbilities? Where is your evidence of his dishonesty? KNC miner went out of business last year and stated that they do not understand how the Chinese miners are making money? Guess they did not have the ASICBOOST. Take your crap to reddit/btc it is full of trolls like you.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:44:31
shapeshift is a scam go trade on hitbtc much cheaper. Atomic Swaps will replace shapeshit.
@_date: 2019-01-30 16:15:26
 Gonna get the audible version. Heard lot of good stuff.
@_date: 2019-01-20 00:32:28
Keiser Report always enjoy his stuff on RT! 
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:55:40
thx charlie I wrote to coinbase and told them that I will no longer do business with them if they support 2x chain. I hope they start listening to their customers.
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:02:56
Sadly I use to respect Vinny back in the crypto days (6 mo ago). He actually made me  sell most of my stash and btc quadrupled after. I got scared thx to Vinny but not anymore all of these supposed experts can not and will not understand BTC. I always preach that and for once I wish I had taken my own advice. Vinny just get the hell out and drive away in your honda civic. Tired of your tweets.
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:31:21
been trying to convince family and friends to get just one for a while. ""  it is expensive "" , but you can buy $100 dollars worth. nah I will wait till it goes down more. When btc was 500. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:15:05
NO2X, NO2X. Wake the hell up guys another attack is imminent. Lets brush this off like Bcash.
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:54:06
If a lot of the core devs think bip148 is too fast  than we have to be very careful. I am frustrated with the miners, but am not in a rush to push for something that will cause a split. I was all for uasf, but for now I am not gonna implement it on my node.I will wait for bip149
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:08:19
Bcash schills are here beware. BCASH does not follow satoshis vision. Hey Bcash is pumping  don't get rekt.
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:41:53
If UASF is not rushed and well tested then I am all for it, but right now I don't think I can support it.
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:45:55
made my day. love it
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:58:44
This has to be one of the best videos I have seen on BTC. Thank you OP you made my day. Soon everyone will be dancing like Satoshi
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:56:47
Hey we all have regrets. I was buying a little bit of hard hodled btc  every month for 2 yrs. I sold a bunch of btc during the stupid bitcoin forking debate 1 mo ago,  and now I can only buy .1 a month due to the price increase.  Hodl please hodl 
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:49:46
I will not compromise uasf is the only way now the miners are scared everyone. They ignored us and bullied us with a fork. It is time to give power back to the users no hardfork! Lets activate Segwit. What about asicboost should we just forget about that?
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:24:21
Vinny made honest observations, we should not go an attack him for being incorrect. He is written some great blogs on the market of btc and invisible hand. Please stop it with trolling.
@_date: 2017-06-11 03:30:14
I have used that crappy wallet and crappy shapeshift lost btc in the transaction. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:21:25
Compromise is not something you should make with innovation. I believe in BTC and I know Segwit wich has been tested will propel it to new heights.
