Bitcoin solved the problem of being able to send money across the globe without a third party.  If you believe that the price goes to 0 within 10 years, then you must think something else will replace it.
Why do you think Bitcoin will be replaced?  What issues did Bitcoin not solve?
If you don't think something will replace Bitcoin, why not?  A method to send money directly to anyone anywhere in the world is a pretty cool thing.

* Bitcoin is to money (cash?) as e-mail is to mail (letters?)
* No one person or group controls Bitcoin
* Bitcoin [the protocol] vs bitcoin [the currency]
* A small part about how the protocol allows for more than just sending money from A to B

Bitcoin, the protocol, is really good!


Bitcoin, the software, is awful and hard for the average person to use right now.
Like the guy says in the article, it's like the internet/email.  The protocols for those really haven't changed much, we've just got better software to handle them now.  This makes it easier from an end user standpoint.
@_date: 2014-06-24 18:20:04
1 - I don't think most people will care about this one.  Other coins do handle this better, they'll have their uses.
2 - I assume you mean with regards to mining.  This could be an issue, but I know people smarter than me are working on solutions.
3 - (complexity) This is a possible issue, but I haven't seen a good solution yet. (profit margins) Is there a reason they should be anything more than slim?
4 - Transaction speed is not an issue, they're relayed almost instantly.  You probably meant confirmation time, 10 minutes isn't very long to wait for that.  Compare to a credit card where the transaction isn't confirmed past the point of not being reversible for months!
5 - I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this one.  If you mean that investors won't like Bitcoin as much because the ROI isn't going to be as crazy as it was, I agree.  ROI can't stay stupid high forever and will go down eventually.

More like promoting a place of discussion that's trying to help bitcoin.  I really don't personally gain anything from this other than maybe finding some people to bring new ideas to the table.
Because of discussion on the forum there's now a project to get more full nodes setup with tons of connections to the network.  These are being setup all over the world in different locations, helping to ensure that the network is alive and well.
I can see how it's kind of shitty and inappropriate, but I'm running with the precedent set by someone higher up the mod food chain than me.

You didn't link anything?
@_date: 2011-06-28 06:10:56
Yea, it'd be fairly easy to do it without a 3rd party.  You just have to use JSON-RPC to communicate with the bitcoin client, you can pull information from it that way.
@_date: 2011-06-17 23:11:34
It's actually rallying right now!  Up to $17... and that was 2 minutes ago, checked again for posting and at about $16 now.
@_date: 2011-06-12 16:24:55
1 &amp; 2 - No one knows/can tell... it's all guess work.
3 - Correct, the only way for the difficulty to decrease is if there is less power put into mining.
@_date: 2011-11-04 05:55:13
I pull my backup wallet file.... that only matters if the hard drive(s) die.
@_date: 2011-08-12 05:12:36
Great idea, but the title is slightly misleading.
@_date: 2011-06-12 15:34:54
Stopped looking at prices for about 20 minutes, and it went up about $5.
@_date: 2011-08-22 18:50:37

I bought some by writing up an offer on the bitcoin website to buy giftcards for currency.  Did an amazong &lt;-&gt; bitcoin exchange, just make sure to use an escrow service for the BTC.  I had the guy put it into clearcoin and set the fallback thing to not return to him.
@_date: 2011-07-03 04:26:03
Mining on any nvidia card is pretty worthless, they get a lot less mh/s compared to ATI.
@_date: 2011-06-09 18:31:40
As far as I know, it's currently not illegal.  But I'm sure there would be community backlash if they knew who did it.
@_date: 2011-07-22 08:17:02
I don't think you understand how merged mining works...
It would only triple your profits if you were able to do it right now and the nmc/btc ratio stayed exactly the same.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:15:22
The currency is unregulated, but who said the exchange isn't?
@_date: 2011-07-05 19:33:52
Bitcoin will come back, I'm not scared.
@_date: 2011-07-03 05:03:51
I could try to answer, but it would end up being a giant wall of text...
That should do a much better job than I would.
@_date: 2011-06-12 23:32:01
Your best bet is going to be reading the mining section on  when it comes back up (currently down).  There's a lot of good advice, just use the search function and you can find all of the details you need to fine tune your card.
As for the processor... doesn't even matter, mining with CPU is crap compared to graphics cards.
@_date: 2011-06-11 22:37:24
The other problem is dwolla had some issues last week so not as much money was going into MtGox as possible.
Why should MtGox close over the weekend?
@_date: 2011-07-05 18:03:45
I just ordered 3 of them.
@_date: 2011-07-19 10:12:53
So it's basically an exchange?
@_date: 2011-06-13 00:02:47
Does it not pull prices from the API every time?  I tested it against my own site I made for personal use (has other info on it otherwise I would link) and mine updates on each refresh to the most recent price... yours did not seem to.
@_date: 2011-06-12 17:45:29
Been seeing it stuck at:
* Buy: 20.1301
* Sell: 20.49
* Last: 20.15
@_date: 2011-07-23 12:33:11
This is not the kind of thing that's helpful for bitcoin discussion.
@_date: 2011-06-12 17:55:44
I've been seeing their numbers as stuck at the same price for about 40 minutes.  I made a little PHP script of my own that was quicker to refresh than to refresh their website.
See 
@_date: 2011-07-20 05:31:27
I read 1/2 as 0.5 originally, but I can see why it looks sketch as it can be read as "1 or 2" as well.

@_date: 2011-10-18 04:14:43
 or 
@_date: 2011-06-12 03:43:52
Any chance of options for time?  Refreshing every 2 seconds and only having a little data on there is cool... but I'd like to have a 10-15 second refresh time and about 20 minutes of data.

I may be interested in buying them.

@_date: 2011-07-07 01:44:28
I'm wondering what the price/mhash ratio will be.

@_date: 2011-08-10 09:45:00
TL;DR - Old news!
There are a bunch of forum posts that say the same thing, and many of us have already been through it.
@_date: 2011-06-14 15:47:33
The real question is when will mtgox be back up...
@_date: 2016-10-08 16:51:28
I'm wondering the same thing... with no explanation this is just a circle jerk
@_date: 2011-10-19 00:26:20

I'm wondering what the price/mhash ratio will be.
@_date: 2011-07-18 22:32:03
Not everyone signs up for those, it really might help if you gave a general location of where you were.
@_date: 2011-08-23 07:53:55
I wouldn't use the word decrypting as it's not the right thing.  Decrypting implies that the blocks have already been created, and we're figuring out what they are (implying there is a central authority that creates blocks to be decryped).
Solving for blocks sounds more accurate.
@_date: 2011-06-24 12:08:06
Why go there?  I see tons of people asking for invites, but every time I look at the depth of market chart on the top right it's next to nothing.
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:57:46
Well this is obviously a scam.  If someone could provide those kind of returns on money, why would they be giving it away?
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:59:04
And I'm taking that as we will soar through the previous high!

That calculator looks like it's not really taking into account difficulty changes.
Check out  for a better calculator.  The default on this one has difficulty moving up 80% a month.

Check comments again, I was able to pull whois info.
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:18:51


What does that have to do with Coinbase and Apple?
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:24:37
I wouldn't, the value is going up too quickly.
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:15:12
You'd have to ask the person who created the transaction to get the real answer.
They're all probably software errors.
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:17:34
Because they aren't actually -600%
@_date: 2013-10-19 14:46:41
It's done by people who are upset they didn't get on bitcoin mining earlier.

I've never had any issues with them, bought and sold a lot of BTC there.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:35:59
Selling bitcoins for credit/debit is very risky for the seller, you could issue a chargeback then they'd be out the coins.
Most exchanges are legitmate business, if you have any questions about which ones are good or not you can make/read posts here.
@_date: 2013-05-17 03:04:11
I called this shit the first day I saw it, nobody listened... I'm tysat on the bitcoin forums.
@_date: 2013-08-13 17:01:54
Why would people quit mining?  If they already have the hardware the odds are it's not going to suddenly turn unprofitable.
@_date: 2013-10-04 16:39:55
It's unlikely that they're going to outlaw it now, they've pretty much already given the go ahead on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:37:23
I'm really disappointed with it most days sadly
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:38:14
I've had no issues with them, been using them for 8-9 months.
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:04:29
It's definitely a scam, the question is when will it stop.
@_date: 2013-10-13 15:52:31
I think you're less likely to get a response from theymos here is all.
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:22:24
What's the context of the interview?  They probably are focusing on some aspect of Bitcoin, I could give you a few topics if you give a little more detail.
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:54:03
Transaction volume has nothing to do with mining difficulty, there's only one thing that affects difficulty changes.  That would be the time it has taken for the previous 2016 blocks when it comes time to adjust (every 2016 blocks).  If it was less than 2 weeks difficulty goes up, it it was more then difficulty goes down.
@_date: 2013-03-16 06:06:01
I think that looks a little familiar to something I read this afternoon....
Kickstarter Support, Mar 15 15:17 (EDT):
Thanks for reaching out and for taking the time to send along your feedback. Although we don't accept Bitcoin as a form of payment on the site, I'll pass the suggestion along to the rest of the team that there's interest in having it as a feature. At Kickstarter we are constantly working to improve the experience for both our backers and creators. Community feedback like this is what keeps us motivated. Thanks for being a thoughtful backer and member of the Kickstarter community.
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:03:31
I was aiming my post at the poster here on reddit.  Doesn't seem important that someone who's new on bitcointalk is in newbie jail.
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:10:58
It allows for a great opportunity to tag people with RES for future use.
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:03:16
Then start one?
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:47:22
Well nothing has moved out of the address yet.
@_date: 2013-10-16 21:45:59
Just learned about massdrop a week or two ago myself, being able to pay with bitcoins is nifty!
@_date: 2013-05-11 15:16:48
Any explanation as to how it works?
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:59:39
I'm calling troll for now...
@_date: 2013-09-06 03:10:57
Some dude did threaten to DDoS the board if he got banned earlier today.

Don't store your bitcoins in an online wallet, no need to worry then!
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:53:07
The downside is the owners would probably be operating at a loss, unless it was near a population that was very interested in buying/selling bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:41:52
Neither?  We don't need to see this argument again, many people have made it already.
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:31:38
Except that the bitcoin network is really only good for calculating SHA256 hashes due to the use of ASICs... so I wouldn't really count it for comparing, because it can only do one thing.
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:04:25
It's more of a security thing I think, no one knows what the shortened URL leads to.
@_date: 2013-10-13 13:53:37
You'd probably be better off asking this in the Meta section of bitcointalk rather than on reddit.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:07:12


Yes it does, there are laws about that kind of stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:29:16
Because more people want to buy than want to sell.
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:48:13
No, go away
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:53:53
Please provide outside proof of identity.
EDIT: It appears the troll has been scared away.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:41:28
I've looked into both, and either should be great for integration.
@_date: 2013-09-18 16:52:23
You shouldn't have a problem using those assets (I wouldn't think) because you can prove that you own them.  It really comes down to "can you document it?" for mortgages, and that should be easy enough to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:04:22
That delay exists because it's hard to get money into btc-e.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:03:11
Ok, what does that have to do with anything?  That would have zero effect on using a mixing service.
@_date: 2013-10-13 17:33:22
Good to know, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:26:49
Mining won't end in 2140, if mining ends bitcoin dies.

Downvoted because QR code in image.  This community does not need to turn towards e-begging anymore than it already has.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:36:26
Coinbase is not an exchange, so using them in this example is just wrong.  They are a broker who buys and sells bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:14:55
What?  I don't understand the question you're asking.
Side note, is english a second (or later) language?
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:32:19


I think that's all it really boils down to.

Also wrong, but you should never realize a loss unless you really need the cash (when dealing with bitcoin).
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:07:21
So that's like giving him 50 mBTC and a quarter, right?
@_date: 2013-08-13 17:18:53
That's only really going to affect anyone who is GPU mining, which is such a small percentage of the current hash rate.  I'm pretty sure GPU mining is still profitable if you already own the cards anyways (too lazy to do the calculations).

But they're not stopping you from sending money, everyone who has a business savings account probably has a business checking account too.
I'm willing to be they're making this change because it makes for easier account/compliance/etc.
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:46:57
Not sure what you mean.  If OP had searched for 'bitmit' it would have been obvious that this had been posted many times already.

Enough people typing up enough predictions and you're bound to see a few correct ones...

Got a link to a legitimate source?  I'm guessing the answer is no.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:45:10
You're looking at this incorrectly...  If Bitcoin were averaging 46.38% growth monthly that means in 10 months it would have 4516.66% growth.
(1.4638^10 = 45.1666)
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:36:14
I don't think there's enough news yet to make that happen.  Do you really want the same stories being repeated every 30 minutes like regular news channels?
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:08:48
That's pretty much what I said.

Weird reddit account restrictions I assume.
I think theymos or sirius would be the only people that could bring it back up.  I'm not even sure if sirius still has server admin rights, but I'm sure that someone other than theymos does.
EDIT - This is tysat from bitcointalk
@_date: 2013-10-12 12:18:21
If you admit to having lousy credit, why should a website loan you money for free?  The point of them doing this is to offset some risk.
@_date: 2013-10-27 23:53:09
no, it's not funny
@_date: 2013-09-25 16:58:11

20 BTC were received in 4 transactions that happened in a 2 minute window.  It was probably him or some friends sending the bitcoins to make a big news story.  No reason to stop that from happening!

Those are just some of the questions I'd have before considering using a bitcoin storage service.  If it looked legit I'd consider keeping some there.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:08:24
Honestly, I have no idea where their volume comes from.  I think there issues are with USD and EUR movement.  So Japan and China can trade there and be fine, that's probably where most of the volume comes from.
Plus I believe they order match across currencies as well (thought I saw that somewhere), that may also be why the USD price keeps going up.

Not trusting bitcoin and calling it a ponzi are two different things.

There's no such thing as a private address, there is a private key though.  The private key is what is translated into a Bitcoin address and is what allows you to spend bitcoins.

If you use a credit card correctly it can be a great tool!
Pay off your card every month (read as don't spend more than you can afford) and you'll never be hit with interest.
Credit card companies can offer great protection on services (extra warranties, disputing charges, etc) that cash cannot.
If you ever plan to buy a house or car, and not pay 100% of the cost, you'll need a credit score.  Using a credit card responsibly helps to get you a higher credit score, which usually means lower interest rates on any money borrower for a car or house.

Another option is to send all of your coins to a web based wallet (blockchain.info maybe?), create a new wallet.dat, encrypt it, send all coins to an address from the new wallet.

I really doubt bitcoin is the reason for your account being closed if you were not trading a lot.  I'd try to figure out why it was closed before jumping to conclusions.

@_date: 2013-12-02 17:53:33
Getting engaged at 20?  Sounds like a bad idea to me.
Buying bitcoins on credit?  An even worse idea.
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:42:00
Cool idea, but it's really a waste of time and money.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:14:55
More like MtGox screwed themselves when they lied about money transmission.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:35:38
0.07 BTC is about $77 not $7

I've yet to see proof that Ross Ulbricht actually had 600,000 bitcoins in a wallet.  That number was given as the estimated total for all comissions received from the Silk Road, not as his profit.  These writers really need to do a little more research before putting out articles.
Please correct me if I'm wrong by linking me to the proof.
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:33:55


Not sure how far you'll get, someone in it for the profit will probably try to push you out of the market.
@_date: 2013-10-31 12:54:21
I don't think it's funny, just seems like people trying to force a meme.

How detailed do you plan to get on Bitcoin's technical aspects?
@_date: 2013-10-13 14:54:00
24 hours is a short sample time... let's see what happens over the next week or two.

You're correct, there's no central authority.
It would only happen with a lot of planning, I'm sure there would be a lead time of a few years or more.  It would involve everyone running new clients which dictate a protocol change after a certain block.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:35:15
It's hard to get money into btc-e, so the price seems to stay lower there.
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:45:06
People are still calling Bitcoin a ponzi scheme?
@_date: 2013-05-05 04:47:44

You clearly aren't geeky enough then!
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:39:11
Interesting.  How are you solving the problem of stolen credit cards and chargebacks?
@_date: 2013-08-21 18:25:51
It'd be better to link to something that explains that site rather than link to a .onion address straight from reddit.
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:29:17


Should probably be changed to no, as no one can [accurately] predict what's going to happen with the price.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:54:38
Having no idea what you're talking about, priceless!

If you know anywhere further west (Leesburg) post something up here.
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:54:31
I envision something more like
Gmail : SMTP :: Google Bitcoin Service : Bitcoin
With that service being whatever Google decides to make... maybe a wallet, exchange, or payment processor.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:44:59
I've seen it many many times, always by people who just learned about bitcoin and don't understand it while wanting to label it as something bad.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:35:38
It's a joke website
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:02:54
I doubt it's actually being sold for that much, probably an old listing.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:56:44
Was about to ask that exact same question.
If anyone does present a graph showing that data, it's bound to be flawed.
@_date: 2013-08-13 18:16:38
Thanks for doing the calcs, I'm just lazy....
I figured it was still profitable to run a GPU on bitcoin, saw something about it on bitcointalk earlier today.  Even when it becomes unprofitable to GPU mine bitcoin you can always switch to an alt-coin and convert to BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:53:17
Seems like coming to reddit is part of the Coinbase customer support process now...
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:01:09
Clearly the price is going to keep going up then!
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:52:57
I'm not one to promote begging!  Plus I've got enough.
@_date: 2013-11-10 13:40:58
Using open source software is a little different than an anonymous person running a web wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:12:47
Having to wait a few months to see a return on an investment... that sounds so awful!!!
@_date: 2013-10-25 12:54:05
Yup, time to get rid of your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:18:58
I mean because if you lend me 5 BTC today and I spend them, then what happens when I owe you 5 BTC in a year but it costs 10x the $ amount I used them at.
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:45:38
Seconding Coinbase if OP is in the US.
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:33:26
I'd try restarting your computer then.

The numbers will show which way is better, I'm guessing accepting USD is the better way.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:47:04
I haven't had any issues selling them BTC to get USD, usually takes 3-5 business days for me.
With sending from Electrum you should be fine if the coins are sent back to you.
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:44:58
@_date: 2013-03-16 06:40:20
Here's the difference....
If BTC decimal place is moved, everyone with BTC has X amount more or less.  X being the factor of how the decimal place was moved.  No one gains/loses anything compared to everyone else.
When the Fed prints more money, the Fed has more money.  They don't have out money proportionally to everyone who currently has cash, so the new money is all in one place.
@_date: 2013-10-22 02:28:30
No, you'll always be able to generate a brain wallet (that's what the words are for)
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:03:18
Because the price doesn't always make ridiculous swings
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:48:37
To build on top of, yes.  I'm not sure how well a Google-coin would do in the market.
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:05:37
 :P
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:59:02
The lead time seems to be about 2 weeks, 10 emails, and a reddit post.
@_date: 2013-10-04 12:55:42
Go on... I'd be curious to hear how you lost over $200,000
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:09:55
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:58:49

Coinbase needs to step their game up
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:37:26
Even if you had bought at the peak of the last bubble and held till today you would be looking at a profit.
@_date: 2013-10-30 21:49:12
Don't buy anything for mining, it's not worth the money it costs.  You're better off buying a little bit of BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:41:54
Just wait till your in sync and it will be fine OP
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:06:00
Fancy, is there any way to enable viewing of those stats to the public?
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:12:20


Wells that's a BS reason... I'm sure he could tell someone who works for him to go buy some.

Let's stop with the circlejerk posts here...
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:47:30
The differences mainly come from how hard/easy it is to get money in/out of the exchange.
Example: It's really hard to get USD out of MtGox so the bitcoin price there is always higher.  This happens because people want to get money out so they buy BTC and transfer it out that way.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:23:19
Did not know that, so my cheapness (about buying a color printer) worked out to my advantage!

The reward for discovering a block started at 50 BTC per block.  It's set to halve every 210,000 bocks.  Currently we're in the 25 BTC per block phase.  Somtime in 2016 (approximately) it will go to 12.5 BTC per block.
Read through  for more information.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:21:55
I don't know anything about that specific website, sorry.
@_date: 2013-10-21 21:12:54
I was thinking the same thing... I guess Coinbase disagrees.
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:06:43
That's what I was working on doing, but am too lazy to type out super long answer.  Also wanted to point out that these are not intermediate bitcoin user questions, these are questions from a newcomer.
@_date: 2013-11-08 04:31:24
That's good to see with the recent price increase.
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:40:07
mybitcoins is dead, what worries you about the safety of your coins?
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:02:09
I'm not saying it wouldn't work.  ~~You~~ OP asked about a downside and I gave one.
There's definitely potential, but only if you're in the right place.
EDIT: Fixed who I was talking about...
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:55:20
More people buying than selling
@_date: 2013-09-24 16:49:06
Do we really need the "XXXXX - Bitcoin users unaffected" threads?  Seems like posts like these are just a circle jerk to get upvotes.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:03:40
More people want to sell it today than want to buy it.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:26:23
I believe you're SOL, I don't think they attempt to repull.

It would probably take longer :\

There would likely be a lot more compliance for them to handle.

@_date: 2013-12-04 16:17:45
And why is a new subreddit required?
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:52:10
Scam or stupid, pick one to describe the company.  They either took the funds themselves, or didn't actually have a cold wallet set up.

Don't panic sell!  If the price drops some, just keep holding.

Nope, the loss hasn't actually happened till you sell... gains are the same.

Hahaha yea.... I'd post that at me too.  Had to post something after spending a while getting it right this afternoon.
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:03:21
Dude, the questions you're asking are nowhere near intermediate:
* 1 - There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins
* 2 - Bitcoins are created by whoever discovers the block
* 3 - Difficulty is constantly growing based off of the speed the network is generating blocks.  The reward in the future will be for transaction fees.
