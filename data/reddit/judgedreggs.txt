~~they~~ *we* still published...
You really should disclose your relationship with buttercoin instead of thinly veiling yourself as an impartial third party.

Well it first started as a response to the Mt. Gox exchange pausing trades due to inadequate trading technology. They wanted to use LMAX architecture which is much more scalable than whatever mess Mt Gox was using. They also wanted to keep it open source so other exchanges could adopt the technology.
A couple weeks or months later, there were dollar signs and things changed. There was no more open source project, they took Google Venture money and went to YC to work on making buttercoin a proprietary exchange. This is speculation, but I think the high cost of living and greed caused them to follow the incubator and VC path, and also abandon the open technology create a walled garden.
I want to believe them and trust them, but they really dropped the ball on several fronts. Look at the first comment on this HN thread about buttercoin:  Notice the corporate speak about wanting to build OSS.

VC firms act first a financial company, looking to make large short term returns. Scams can sometimes be a great way to do just that, so big VC firms also back total scams. Ever read about the shady practices of Groupon, Zynga, Yelp, Airbnb, Uber, etc? 
VC firms may have some credibility, but they may also be one of the 70% that just totally goose egg. Ever heard of Andressen Horowitz backed startup Clinkle? It is so bad that they took Clinkle off their portfolio companies list.
