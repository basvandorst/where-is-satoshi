Why didn't they instantly convert it to fiat if this was a concern?
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:50:19
I've already said to him there's probably not going to be many people paying with it. Just hoping I can get him some good publicity.  
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:52:26
I'll be a lot more careful than that. Probably get them to use phone's ipad's and then transfer the funds at the end of the day / week to another wallet. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:16:20
So by my friend offering Bitcoin as a payment in his cafe he's going to scare people off? Pull the other one
@_date: 2014-12-22 15:34:31
I agree all these things and probably more need thinking about. The shop / cafe isn't massive and I'm not expecting a stream of Bitcoin users to come flooding in. They are young people that can use technology, i'll probably set them up a paper wallet to keep their money safe and unless it turns into a million pound project I think they can probably hand ball in the money they receive through Bitcoin every week / month like they do with cash. I don't think they have a big staff turnover so can't see that being a big problem, but definitely worth thinking about. Thanks for the advice 
@_date: 2014-12-15 12:00:00
Thanks for your reply. I'm not sure how a person that wants to use the breifcase will be able to use 2FA on our own wallet. 
We want the whole thing to be automated. 
Are you from York?
@_date: 2014-12-23 12:05:19
We haven't set it up yet. Going to do it after Xmas. I'll post it all on here when it's all done.
@_date: 2014-12-15 13:44:43
Thanks for the information. I hadn't heard of HD wallets and it looks like there is a fair bit there I need to get my head around. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 21:43:43
I'll look into Coinofsale, thanks. I'm assuming he'll want to keep them himself unless in the unlikely event of him getting a lot of people paying in Bitcoin. And like I said before I'm assuming Bitpay is the way forward for instant transfers, but I'll happily look into yours and maybe recommend it to him. 
How did you go about getting the newspaper to cover it? 
@_date: 2014-12-22 15:28:22
Yes, this is something I'm looking to do too. I'm going to try and get some of the local newspapers / media outlets involved to make a story about the first shop in Leeds to accept Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-05-21 14:56:22
Yes, it's called Global Tribe Cafe
@_date: 2015-05-21 12:07:59
This is the second shop I've convinced to accept bitcoin. The other one was a couple of months ago at a friends vegetarian cafe in Leeds. It just goes to show many people are open to the ideas of trying it, especially since it is free to implement. If you live in the area please try out my friends salon and help the bitcoin ecosystem grow.
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:37:59
Wow, I didn't know that. I wonder if he still lives here
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:37:00
No way. Please go and get a hair cut. And PM me, it be good to meet some local bitcoin people
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:33:39
We  haven't done any work on their website yet, which they have said needs updating, so thanks that is a great idea. They also sell crystals in the shop below 
Please go give their food a try. I'm not veggy either but loved the food. Please post on here if you go. It helps to get the word out that their are places accepting bitcoin. Thanks 
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:51:10
Not sure of the name yet as I haven't been there. I only met him Friday through a Friend. It's a hippy shop and has a cafe above it.
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:36:16
haha thanks
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:35:30
not yet, but will be. I've requested to add them to 
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:37:38
Yes, give him a go. He has some skills with the scissors. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:34:56
just a wallet at the moment, but if he ever gets high transactions i'll set him up with bitpay of something
@_date: 2014-12-15 12:01:24
Thanks. I knew there would be an easy way of doing this once you know how. I'll look into ssh. A secure tunnel is a good wall against hackers? 
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:20:07
Nope, but have now. Just bought some. Muchas gracias :)
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:31:51
I like the idea. I'll look into this more
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:11:34
Great, thanks for that. Just tried it and it's very good
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:09:00
Looks good. I'll show it to the band. Thanks
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:41:24
Thanks. I sent a request.
@_date: 2014-12-15 14:00:58
Ok thanks for all your advice. Lot's for me to research into there. I'll post the progress of the project. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:52:51
so you want to charge 5 cent for a transaction even if that transaction is less than 5 cent? One of the great features about bitcoin is the micro payment option. If we start to charge more for a transaction we lose this unique feature. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:36:02
I don't think Cut Graphics is still up and running, but i may be wrong
@_date: 2016-06-07 22:25:14
God it's hard to listen to Alex Jones, but good to see he's admitting bitcoin is revolutionary
@_date: 2016-06-07 22:49:21
I don't think the price will be good there though. Thanks 
@_date: 2016-06-08 10:26:01
But surely the trouble with circle is that you can't decide the price you want to sell at like a trading platform? 
@_date: 2015-08-17 19:15:00
Many thanks for all the donations so far! 
@_date: 2015-08-17 10:04:14
They are also interested in releasing music with Bitcoin only payment in the future, and i'm keen to try some kind of live streaming through Streamium for them. 
Here's a very new story about them and the channel 4 advert. 
Thanks guys :)
@_date: 2015-08-17 12:14:41
Yeah I've heard of that. I'll look into it more. Thanks 
@_date: 2015-07-25 10:03:22
Ok, well I don't understand all of that, so I'll have to do some research. So sending to an address once is safer than sending multiple times. By what you've told me, even sending once sounds risky, because your public key can be found out? 
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:42:42
Luckily, this didn't get much of a mention, but the same guy did point this out. I said it uses less power than the current financial systems, and that 30 wind turbines could fuel it (which someone told me, i'm yet to do the maths myself). 
@_date: 2015-07-11 11:33:18
haha, yeah. Good one
@_date: 2015-07-25 13:56:31
Ok, so I'm OK then. If I've sent some money 5 or 6 times to a offline generated paper wallet that has never been used to send btc, all should be fine? 
@_date: 2015-07-20 07:43:47
Thanks, I use Airbitz, but how do I add merchants?
@_date: 2015-07-20 08:04:49
ok, thanks. I really want it on there, because i think it is one of the main sites people check first in the UK. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 09:22:01
Why is it a problem to send to a address more than once? The private key of that address is still secret
@_date: 2015-07-20 08:21:32
I have. But unsure how many people check this?
@_date: 2015-04-19 14:17:50
Because that would cost money to set up, would it not? 
@_date: 2015-04-19 14:25:51
So how do they make money? I thought they charged a fee? 
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:52:15
What are you even doing in this sub reddit if you don't understand any of this? For one it's for buying something online. 2) it's because paypal is very expensive. 3) People don't always like to give bank details. 4) because it costs money to set up a credit or debit card option. 5) because bitcoin is awesome. 6) because it opens up their business to people that it wouldn't normally attract 7) because it is free to do so. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 12:38:18
Thanks, i've bought from there before, but the one's I got were not very big or easy to see when put on a window
@_date: 2015-11-26 09:06:27
@_date: 2015-11-25 14:02:09
Hey, sorry i put the wrong link in for the salon. I've corrected now. It should be Cut Salon on Gillygate, not the Blake &amp; Butler. Thanks for updating everything. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 21:48:21
Great thanks
@_date: 2015-03-31 12:27:50
Like the people that were responsible for the JP Morgan and HSBC scandals? No bribing involved there? 
@_date: 2015-11-24 21:49:07
That be great thanks. PM please with some prices and how we'd sort it out. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 15:54:48
By the way, this is not to store lots of btc on, just to help move money around. I know all about keeping btc offline and so on. Thanks
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:38:24
haha, ah well. Keep it in mind if you ever pop our way. All the best :)
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:04:45
Wow, thank you. It's not actually my restaurant, it's a friends, and I've persuading him to accept BTC. I hope it serves him well. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:55:02
Pro, as in making a business out of getting places to accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:34:59
Haha, come for a coffee ;)
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:32:42
Here's an image from yesterday
@_date: 2015-03-07 08:30:00
Yes, I agree there probably won't be a cue of people waiting to spend bitcoin, but I'm hoping at least I can get them some good publicity and get a few people to understand bitcoin. It's gong to be interesting to see how many do come and buy with bitcoin though. 
I'm actually from York, which is only half an hour away. From this, I hope to use the experience to persuade more places in York and leeds to accept bitcoin. I like your idea of having meet ups.... I'll give that some thought and may ask my friends if I can hold one in their cafe. 
Anyway, look out for another post later today when I've set them up.
Thanks for the comment. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 21:22:35
Great, thanks. So how do they keep the price stable if it's all on the bitcoin network? or will the price fluctuate with the bitcoin price?
@_date: 2015-03-07 08:08:16
Haha, thanks dude :)
@_date: 2015-03-10 10:40:03
Yeah, it would be nice. But i suppose doing it for free to start with could lead to something like that as it get's more popular. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:32:11
Thank you. Please drop in if you're ever in Leeds. All the best
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:56:45
Mario on the left is the owner and the veggy, and one of the most spiritual dudes I've ever met. They do meditation classes there sometimes too. I'm hoping to attend one soon. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 14:19:48
This was just after a test transaction for 2 pence using the Airbitz app. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:07:11
Hi, it's not my restaurant, it's a friends, but tell your sister to please pop over and buy some food / drink with bitcoin.... it be great to get as many people in as possible to use it to help get the staff used to using it. Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-03-08 14:26:52
A friend paying in BTC
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:30:23
I agree, they won't get many, but I think comparing it to wordpress is unfair, because not too many people want to pay to read blogs. If you look at Dell computers, Expedia and Overstock you'll see that they had quite a bit of success. 
Anyway, it's not the point of me doing this. It's a new fascinating technology, that i'm excited about and want to learn more. By doing things like this and little engineering projects I keep learning and hopefully understand more how it will be useful to us all. I think everyone in bitcoin should be trying to help educate those around us, while learning more themselves.   
@_date: 2015-11-25 12:35:47
Cut Salon in York down Gillygate: 
and Global Tribe Cafe and Crystal shop in Leeds:
Where are you from?
@_date: 2015-03-10 11:23:12
I do like the look of it, and I recommended it to the my friends because I'm told it is the most secure. We had a little issue when we tried to do the first transaction because the amount requested wasn't showing up when we pressed next. After a few attempts it worked. I'm struggling to work out what merchant mode does? And how do I get my friends cafe and shop onto your map?
@_date: 2015-02-04 12:44:39
Sounds cool. But I'm wanting this option on your desktop computer. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 11:09:45
Great news. What's a Bitcoin POS app? Like a changetip app that works on the top of sites?
