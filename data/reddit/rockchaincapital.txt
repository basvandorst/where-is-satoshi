Four years ago today was March 2014, and a Bitcoin was around $600. That would have left him with 0.0017 BTC, now worth around $14.50.
Great return on investment, just not a large amount :/
March 22, 2014 BTC Price used $600
Today’s BTC Price used $8,700
$1/$600 = 0.0016666 BTC Purchased
0.0016666 * $8,700 = $14.50 Today

With today’s difficulty, a normal computer won’t be profitable no matter how hard you hash lol

Yes you will have to download another client and feed in the seed phrase

@_date: 2018-03-24 09:48:45

I think your BTC address is incorrect, no? It’s empty and doesn’t have tx history

I think it’s a good looking website already. One thing I can think of off the top of my head is that there seems to be a lot of articles and especially reddit/tweets that is junk. I’m guessing you’re automatically showing things with certain keywords or something like that. But if someone how you can add a filtering system, whether it’s like a minimum threshold of retweets a tweet must have before its included or something else etc.

Okay so I’m not sure what files you have. Do you have your master key? What files do you have? You should have an .xpub and a .xprv
If you have the xprv then use the ninki tool. If you only have the .xpub you’ll need the seed phrase too and just load it into a new wallet. 
If you don’t have the private keys or seed phrase then you won’t be able to recover the wallet

It’s a “private key”,  you shouldn’t give it to anyone
@_date: 2018-04-23 02:33:11
You too

Yes, because you could amass a bunch of hash power and turn it all on at once.

What kind of hashrate are you getting?

This isn’t representative. For example I currently have 15 addresses with less than 1BTC in them. Additionally, I created 100s of addresses for transactions which now all have basically zero satoshis in them.
