selling bitcoin is a last resort, but as you're unemployed and in debt - it sounds like you're at last resorts.
think you should sell it off and use it to sustain yourself while you search for a job.
when you find one, buy some more. prices might have increased, but that's life.

damn, same story here, i read the gawker silk road article in 2011. only difference was, i was more fascinated with the drugs - and spent the next several months sampling the mail order catalog. 
in the april 2013 bubble i made about $1000 off spare change from my silk road account. cashed it out and thought i'd won. 
i watched the november 2013 bubble from the sidelines and vowed not to let that happen again. now i've scraped together as many bitcoins as i can afford and crossed my fingers that pattern will repeat.

i too am a bit peeved by this post. either comment on the incident, or don't. don't post a thread that basically says 'no comment'.

how do miners simultaneously search for new blocks and verify transactions?
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:20:34
can't believe it doesn't have a pin code? so if anyone gets access to your unlocked phone, they can open and empty your wallet? yikes.

the one thing i'm not getting is the slow speed of bitcoin transactions. whenever i transfer one it takes up to 10 minutes to appear at the destination wallet. which works ok for bank-style transfers, but who would want to pay for a cab ride with it and wait for it to clear?

maybe so but that would shake everyone's confidence in cryptos, from infrastructure to retailers, consumers, and investors. 
not saying that's good incentive for anyone to disrupt bitcoin, but if it did fail it would take a long recovery.

i see, thanks.
to summarise, the transaction requires a deposit from both parties in advance, and they split the transaction into chunks the size of the deposit, transferring and verifying each chunk before releasing the deposit.
the infographic on the website makes it clearer.

i hope that centralized mining issue, or any other threat doesn't cause a massive failure. ultimately cryptocurrencies will prevail but i'm fearful of catastrophic losses.

bitcoin is like digital gold. you store your wealth in it for long periods of time.
ethereum will be like programmable money. efficient, quick transactions, smart contracts, decentralized applications.
they can co-exist in the same way gold and fiat co-exist.

i also sold 10 coins and have been regretting it.
i remind myself of the bill bryson quote: 'you can't catch a train without missing the one before it'.
don't miss the next train. ;)

mitigating risk by preparing for disaster by developing potential fixes, running tests and simulations should be in their plan. we accept there is risk but we're not comfortable with waiting until it breaks before coming up with a plan.
don't we have any computer scientists that work for critical systems to advise us here?
