"in a specific pattern calculated to avoid...". This is the definition of intent you are intended to avoid the creation of records you sir are a fuck hat and an idiot.

Okay then this will help... He's a fucking idiot and here is evidence that he doesn't know what he's talking about...   this link clearly shows that structuring payments below $10,000 is not illegal under federal law and it requires intent with the purpose to evade which is what he argued against and is the basis for his claim that I don't know what I'm talking about. Also I did refute his reasons with facts. Present value is highly dependent on future value and primarily expected future value if you didn't expect Bitcoin to have any future value tomorrow you would sell today for any price thus it has an effect and I already showed it to him and my response before I got personal because he got personal

I have to say I disagree with your interpretation in its entirety.  This scales, it decentralizes, it provides incentive to node operators which has been missing (probably just enough to cover electricity).  It is 100% good shit
@_date: 2017-01-07 15:56:34
It encourages you to run a full node which aids in decentralization, greatly.  How much more decentralized would the network be with 50k nodes VS 5k? Answer is a metric shit ton.

@_date: 2017-01-08 14:47:45
Nothing but you just said is true. Mining require special Hardware these days so it is started to centralize which makes keeping the nodes decentralized even more important. Running a note does not require special Hardware or special processing power to compete with other node operators simply requires having an open connection to the internet and honestly rather outdated Hardware. There are over five thousand of them and it is not a competition. With the added incentive from the lightning Network even more nodes should come online. But even if they do not if only half the nodes currently online also became lightning hubs which presumably will be just some additional software the centralization is not an issue
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:26:26

So the big block argument is simultaneously increase block size to lower fees and don't move to a second layer because lower fees hurt miners? This is having both sides of a completely messed up coin. Here's the fact. The incentive for miners to mine and provide security for the network comes in a large part from the value of the coin itself period or miners mining for transaction fees right now no they are mining for the coins. Price appreciation of Bitcoin will keep it that way for a very very long time and once it's no longer that way big transactions on the main chain of hundreds of Bitcoin through businesses and governments will fund the security of the network.

By choosing the dividends reinvested box you are stating that you need no $$ to live on.  So, if you have other money to live on, sure, you can get 6.6% leaving all funds in.  But if you need to eat, buy clothes or other such things, you don't get to reinvest dividends (this applies to 99% of people) and you get the 2% rate and would have been over 100% better off holding Gold.

Diminishing returns on investment.  You can't just keep throwing money at miners and keep making the same return.  Eventually you are earning 1btc for every 1btc you invest, so where is your incentive to invest?
@_date: 2016-12-06 16:18:43
No it would not because the first 1mb would be free because there would be no competition to get in the block.  The competition would only arrive at the same point it currently arrives and fees would be the same to spam the network.
Edit: Additionally the cost to the network would be higher because of the larger blocks. So cost to spam is the same and damage to the network is higher...

It's taken me years to come to this conclusion but, honestly, I don't care if we stay at 1mb forever.  Bitcoins utility is not it's capacity to hold everything on chain but instead it's capacity to be the main chain that links together all possible uses of the block chain (good and bad).  1mb blocks is not hindered growth If I have an immutable chain that connects 100 other value driving chains and that's the path I see taking place and that makes me happy.

"Seconds" was hyperbole by wallpaper not the OP


Not really, the transactions would have to propagate through the network.  Transactions do not reach all nodes at the same time and thus would not necessarily reach the quantum computer first.


Actually shifting them from "moot" to "EXTREMELY far fetched" benefits your argument so I don't see why you are complaining.

If your growth addresses the bottleneck it doesn't need to address other technological limitations because they won't be the limitations of the system... Furthermore there is the ability to soft Fork to tighten the rate of increase if such limitations arise... Did you read the BIP?
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:55:39
Once you understand that we're talking about the bottleneck and growing and not all combined factors growing at the same rate and once you understand that a soft Fork can tone down the growth rate and once you understand that Bitcoin will never ever handle all possible uses on the main Block Chain and maybe you will understand why this will work and wife side chains are necessary for Mass adoption.

Official statement from bitgo, i added the bold, Bitfinex has not disputed the statement.
"Our job is to protect your Bitcoin and continue to improve the security of the service. **BitGo systems were not breached in this attack and our software functioned correctly.** This may seem like an inadequate explanation, because everyone wants to know “what needs to change to avoid what happened in this case,” and we understand that. Fortunately, the Bitfinex configuration was unique and other BitGo customers do not need immediate changes."

Charge a 3% fee to the retailer, give 1% back to the consumer and convince them that the extra 2% they pay on every purchase is worth the "protection" they give...  I don't know if you've ever used those protections but 50% of the time they fail and are shit.  Bitcoin however gives me a lot of protections, like not getting my identity stolen.  I had 2 credit cards replaced in the last 15 months and 5 in the last 3 years.  You call that a good deal?  You keep it.

True.  I would posit however that If the fed didn't abandon the gold standard growth rates in gold would have been higher, though that is speculation.  Bitcoin could force a new "gold" standard on fiat in which case there may be higher than the 4% growth rate.

Using stupid anything and you will fail.  Bitcoin is perfectly traceable.

The GBTC fund does not really buy or sell any bitcoin, they just have a specific supply.  When you buy GBTC you are buying into that fixed supply which, as of this moment, means you pay a very large premium to buy bitcoin.  Also, since GBTC has a fixed supply, buying more GBTC will have no influence on the actual price of Bitcoin.
However, the ETF would be able to buy and sell Bitcoin.  This would introduce demand into the bitcoin economy that GBTC does not introduce.  For example, I have funds in 401 (k)s and IRAs that I cannot invest in bitcoin.  However, if the ETF becomes available I can shift major $$$ to Bitcoin and substantially increase my holdings and, when combined with others doing the same, have a very positive effect on the price.

I'm beginning to think a lot of these posts about Coinbase (by new redditors with no post history) are just FUD.  I've used Coinbase for 3 large purchases and only had trouble with the first purchase which they resolved pretty appropriately.

Actually using average blocksize is misleading due to miners mining empty blocks and drawing down the average.  You need to look at the MEDIAN block size which is basically sitting on the 1mb threshold.

Can someone help me work this out?
Schnorr when combined with lightning network would allow transactions to occur on the lightning Network at whatever the block frequency is for lightning but then would allow all of the transactions that occur on the lightning Network to be updated on the main Bitcoin blockchain with one signature every 10 minutes?
So in other words this plus lightning Network allows Bitcoin to maintain security and to scale at a rate directly related to Total available computing power for lightning?
I'm sure I'm totally misunderstanding so I would appreciate someone dropping some knowledge on me!

Nope, can't do that!  Heres why, if Craig Wright is not Satoshi that means somebody else is AND that person we already know wants to be anonymous THEREFORE that person would not take any action that would take the spotlight off of someone else.  Thus, that person would not send such a message.
This means that if anyone sent that message it would have to be someone who didn't want attention on them and in this case the person sending the message would be Craig Wright and he would be outing himself.

Probably is a Boob.  Best part about his play is that it is the most logical play for someone who is Satoshi AND someone who wants to pretend to be Satoshi and doesn't have the keys.  On a personal note however, if I created Bitcoin or even had a part in it's creation, I wouldn't want my personal life failures to bring Bitcoin down, So yeah, I'd sacrifice myself for the cause.
