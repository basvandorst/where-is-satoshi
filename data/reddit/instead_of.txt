Actually, your English usage was very poor. If English isn't your first language, I sincerely apologize. It is not my intention to be insulting where your language skills are concerned.
You said, "The point of the post is _____..." Assuming you were intending to answer my question, in that blank, a noun or noun clause should exist. However, no noun clause exists; you've used a prepositional phrase that renders the sentence an incomplete one. "...for all the people blaming Mt.Gox and not blaming themselves." For them to what?
Alternatively, the sentence could be interpreted as an answer to a question that I didn't ask. If I had asked "For whom is this the point of this post intended?" then your statement would make sense. However, I didn't ask this, because your target audience seems fairly obvious. Your motives are not.
I assumed that your motives were simply to make people feel bad. However, I now feel that my assumption was incorrect. I think you just have a mental hang-up of some kind regarding the name "Gox." You're assuming that I am championing the name--I am not. Gox could go on to find success under its current name, it could be rebranded and find success, or it could simply disappear. Any of those outcomes are plausible, and none of them would either excite or depress me in particular. I don't *care* about the name of Mt.Gox one way or the other.
You obviously do. You've devoted a considerable amount of time ranting about the company here on Reddit. Why? It seems irrational to me; it serves little purpose.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:14:42
I agree with 3, 4, and 5, but what's wrong with 1 or 2? If a more competently-managed, re-branded Gox were to emerge, why would you oppose it? It would obviously have to be quite transparent and well-run in order to be successful.
What is the point of this post, anyway?
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:34:22
Ugh. Calm down, man. I lost money, too, but... damn.
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:11:15
Unfortunately, you can't quickly get JPY out of Gox, either. I can personally attest to this fact. Been waiting weeks.

Speak for yourself; I've grown to love dogecoin and intend to add it as a payment option to my site.
Also, you're wrong about there being "no tangible reason for anyone to use dogecoin over bitcoin." In fact, there's EVERY reason to use dogecoin over bitcoin; it's cheaper, it's slightly inflationary (possibly), and it's used by folks with a much lighter, friendlier attitude. Transactions are about the people and the product, not the currency (as seems to be the case with bitcoin).
So I dunno, man. I'm all for thanking dogecoin users, but not at all in the manner you have...

JPY withdrawals don't take that long. I got mine in two weeks. ne0futur posted today in IRC that JPY withdrawals should have NO delay now--that is, they'll take place in 24-48hrs, apparently. I'm going to test it tomorrow, but... sure seems like things are headed in the right direction, if true.
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:04:25
So, someone who has less than 5 BTC doesn't qualify as a "little person," regardless of what percentage of their savings/income that amount represents? You intend to simply take their money and give it to those more fortunate? Your plan sucks.
FWIW, I lost more than 5BTC, but I absolutely would not support your plan.
@_date: 2014-02-20 01:57:33
Unless you're withdrawing JPY to a Japanese bank. I got my fiat in about two weeks. Got it two days ago, in fact (withdrawal initiated Jan 31st).

Sorry; that was actually a complete mistake on my part; I'm quite new to these tip-bots. I was trying to figure out how to accept your tip. No worries; I appreciate your kind words!

Not really, but from the chat transcript circulating, it seems quite likely there was, in fact, a massive theft.
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:41:20
I'm not attached to the name. I don't care one way or the other. You do, for some odd reason.
As far as Japanese law goes, your opinion isn't invalid, although I'm curious which specific aspect you find unfavorable. As you are a writer, I can't imagine you actually know very much about Japanese law. It seems quite likely that you're actually just talking out of your arse.
You disagree with me, but you didn't actually answer my last question. Perhaps you have some difficulty understanding the definition of the word "last," as you have used it incorrectly in your post. Alas, your English is even worse than I initially suspected!

As btc inflates to ever-increasing values, the number of people actually willing to spend btc will continue to drop, hoarding will become rampant, and ultimately the entire market will grind to a near-standstill. There will always be people willing to sell, but they will become fewer and fewer as the value climbs. If either curve becomes exponential (or even near exponential), bitcoin is doomed.
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:16:31
I am, but my interest has caused me to be more interested in altcoins such as litecoin or dogecoin. I am fascinated by bitcoin's protocol/underlying system, but believe it may be inherently flawed and represent an early incarnation of a more mature cryptocurrency.
Let the downvotes begin!
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:05:06
Around 16 BTC. Not that much fiat actually invested, though, so I'm not too depressed. I feel quite foolish for betting on Gox, more foolish for standing by them, and even more foolish for not having pulled fiat out when I had the chance (a lot more fiat than I had invested).
It's a good lesson, though. I still feel good about cryptocurrencies and I feel they're the way of the future... but I'm not so certain that bitcoin is the way of the future. I feel like the collapse of Gox, combined with the nature of bitcoin mining (flawed, imho) may prove fatal to the currency... but may contribute to the rise of alternative, superior currencies, currencies that have addressed the shortcomings suffered by bitcoin.
I'm considering litecoin, dogecoin, and the like. I'll have to do some research. This was a good... if costly lesson for me. I'm a teacher, and that little bit of BTC was about all I had. Such is life, I guess. Have to be more prudent in the future...

I'm kicking myself for not submitting a withdrawal when I had the chance. I hope (and I know this will not be popular; it's just my own selfish hope) that they'll take care of their ~300 customers in Japan before they worry about anyone else. Might protect them from Japanese authorities and it would be awesome for me.
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:51:13
Multiple reasons. Proof-of-waste is inherently screwy. Algorithm lends itself strongly to powerful/expensive ASICs, driving out all but the largest players in the mining field, with huge advantages to those who can obtain electrical power through dishonest means. Extremely inflationary--an inflationary currency on its own might be okay, but btc inflation promises to be ridiculous if its strongest proponents are to be believed, and this comes with some srs dangers. A few other reasons; those are the major ones, though, I guess.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:14:28
I can't believe I got under your skin so badly.
There is no reason Gox can't remain in Japan.
There is no reason Mt.Gox can't keep the name "Mt.Gox."
Do you disagree? If so, why? Please be specific.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:33:04
Honestly, I'm kinda feeling this way. Mining has become impossible except for massive investors or scammers. This, combined with the Gox malarkey, have left me feeling a bit ambivalent about bitcoin. I feel like it's gotten too big, too fast; far beyond the common people who made it successful in the first place.
I'm still into cryptocurrencies, but I think the ultimate answer may actually be elsewhere. I'm gonna add litecoin and dogecoin to my store over the next couple of weeks... and may look into dropping bitcoin. We'll see.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:52:51
Actually, I'm an English teacher. It's what I do for a living. Your grammar was exceedingly poor, unfortunately, and your meaning was quite unclear. Fortunately, however, I enjoy giving English lessons! You seem to be a poor student, though. Ah, well.
So you wouldn't have a problem with Gox if it were restructured?
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:59:24
Wat? That's an incredibly poorly constructed sentence. Bro, do you even English?
Also... if the point of this post is to make people feel bad, then I ask again: what's wrong with 1 or 2?
You seem to have some sort of weird issue with the name "Gox" or something. Obviously, a completely new, restructured company, with new management, new software, and new everything except a name would be fine. Heck, assuming they ran their business well, there's no reason to assume they couldn't become the dominant exchange.
So, c'mon, bro. Where's this illogical hatred coming from? So Gox was run by idiots, and only idiots did business with Gox. Big whoop. Get over it already.
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:51:13
LOL You're a terrible writer.
So, I'll ask again: what's wrong with 1 and 2 in your original post?
In point 2 (which, incidentally, is a run-on sentence), you claim that "we do not need to re-brand [Mt.Gox]." Yet, in your post above, you seem to think that a re-branded Gox is "no longer Gox."
You keep throwing additional qualifiers in there, such as "re-name" (I didn't specify that Gox ought to be renamed), "relocated" (I didn't specify that Gox ought to be relocated), etc. These seem to be attempts to justify your original position. They are possibly attempts to refine your original position. That's okay; your original post seems to be poorly thought-out or poorly worded in the first place.
So, I'll ask you YET AGAIN, as clearly as I can:
Assuming that Mt.Gox were under new, more effective management, but also assuming that they remained in Japan, continued under the name "Mt.Gox," and managed to operate somewhat successfully as a cryptocurrency exchange, precisely what negative consequences would occur as a result?

TBH, I'm considering it. Not just because of the Gox incident, but also because of the mining situation. Mining is now entirely in the hands of the incredibly wealthy; the common man has absolutely no means by which to successfully mine bitcoin with a modest investment. Scrypt-based cryptocurrencies offer a slight advantage in this regard... and I'm looking at making the jump. I'll probably continue to offer BTC sales on my site--it will probably even be the primary listing... but I'm going to add litecoin and dogecoin over the next week or two (hopefully; assuming all goes well). I'll see how the market reacts to this situation as time goes on... but I have to say... I'm starting to become increasingly suspicious that this may be an indication of severe, inherent flaws in bitcoin. It's not especially surprising; bitcoin is a very, very new thing.
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:37:38
Hours? LOL
I'm gonna do a quick withdrawal tomorrow. ne0futur said in the IRC channel that JPY withdrawals are no longer delayed, and that I can expect a JPY withdrawal to go through within 24-48hrs.
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:28:08
LOL If it were possible to get JPY out of MtGox, this would be fantastic advice.
Unfortunately, I've been waiting weeks just like everyone else. Hopefully it doesn't soon turn into months...
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:43:24




Sorry; I meant that rhetorically. I thought it was obvious. My mistake.




Except that we do. You're thinking about this in terms of experienced BTC users; you should think about it in terms of the average non-tech layperson. There's a very obvious psychological urge to own at least "one" of something (you can see signs of this all over the place), but people who are new to/dabble in/curious about BTC are hesitant to spend ~$650 on something, particularly if they don't understand it well. It's remarkably easy to own "one" dogecoin and join in the fun--and it actually feels like fun (unlike BTC, which feels like joining a cult of tinfoil-hat-wearing weirdos (no offense; I'm one of those tinfoil-hat-wearing weirdos, myself)).




True... but not all. I'm in both camps; I see obvious advantages to a deflationary currency and obvious advantages to an inflationary currency. whynotboth.gif




**Edit:** case in point--downvotes on my op...




I agree! Which is one of the reasons why I think dogecoin is doing so well, and why many many new folks might perceive many BTC enthusiasts to be... less-than-friendly. Dogecoin enthusiasts seem to be outgoing, people-friendly, excited for personal contact, involvement, and discussion. BTC enthusiasts seem to be cold, angry, and elitist (I'm not entirely innocent; please don't think I'm attacking you or anyone else in particular).


Probably so. There are a lot of other factors involved in Dogecoin's popularity, though; I think it's worth considering all of those factors in an open-minded manner.
@_date: 2014-03-01 05:51:54
I'm not sure that there is a way to buy directly. A dude from the Japanese Digital Money Association (did I get that name right?) lamented the fact that Gox was the only way. Soo...
I'm in the same boat.
