This is really immature, sorry. You guys know the account wasn't hacked, sold, and the user isn't pretending to be someone else.

Couldn't you pay for your chicken with a low fee, then after you leave the restaurant, publish a new zero value transaction with a higher nonce and higher fees? Maybe it doesn't work like this in Bitcoin but with Ethereum it would make everybody ignore the transaction with the lowest nonce. I think.

Don't confuse Market Share with Market Cap.
Bitcoin's Market cap has gone up like you point out. Bitcoin's market share [has gone down by a lot.](

None, because he didn't reverse anything. The Ethereum Foundation proposed several solutions, one of which was freezing DAOs funds while they were in the "cool off" period. The overwhelming majority of miners and users decided to apply that fix because it made most sense at the time. The EF nor Vitalik have any authority to change anything in the blockchain, just as with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:50:47
I still believe you were thinking of Market Cap, otherwise why would you say that it's gone up 10x?


I know an even better term: Market Share. Which by definition means compared with every other crypto. sigh...
This conversation is getting pretty thick, and since you "Couldn't give a shit", I don't think we are going anywhere anyways.

Like with every blockchain, whatever the 51% say is the truth, becomes truth for all practical purposes. That fork happened because there was almost unanimous will to revert the hack and it was easy and clean to do so. Another fork could happen any time, but as the blockchain grows it becomes harder to convince the 51% to do it. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:03:35
Not in terms of market share
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:53:43
That's not true. There haven't been any SERIOUS bugs in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Most bugs are user errors in their contracts. It's not up to Ethereum developers to fix those bugs, just as it's not intel's problem if your program crashes (most of the time anyways)
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:43:38
One could argue that there was an implicit vote as people could (at any point) switch to the fork of the chain where the DAO hack wasn't reversed (ETC), which wasn't very big but could have become whatever the people wanted it to become.
But that's not the point. I'm not here to argue whether the reversing of the DAO hack was the right thing to do (My personal opinion is that it was, but I respect people that value immutability above everything).
I just wanted to rebuke your claim that Turing completeness means fixing one bug after the other with no end. They are building a virtual machine. This is something we've done many times before and it absolutely is doable. Turing completness means developers have to be careful because they are free to fuck up in many different ways. By the way, Turing completeness doesn't mean every program you make has to use every possible function in every possible way. You can use a Turing complete platform to build SIMPLE programs that WORK. That's where the Open Source nature of it all comes in. What's going to happen is we are going to reuse good code we know works and try to minimize homebrew code (just like we do with cryptography in our software).

No. What they are saying is: there's no way this crowded restaurant is going to feed the whole country, which is a requirement when you're trying to build a digital CURRENCY.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:18:18
A restaurant that strives to be the only restaurant people use should absolutely be able to feed the whole country, as stupid as the analogy is.

I know dontthrowbtc, but you replied "only 8x", and when I clicked on the notification to reply, it had changed to your current comment. If this was not you and it was some weird reddit voodoo, then I apologise. But given the context, I'm almost 100% sure you edited your comment quickly after submitting. I don't expect you to admit it, so let's leave it at that.
And yes, BCH still has to prove it can consistently handle 8Mb blocks, but there is no technical reason to believe it wont. There are many concerns about long term centralisation, but no doubt about its capability to sustain 8Mb blocks that I know of.

You are replying to a post about buying coffee with Bitcoin. "I don't care about that" is not a very strong argument.

A mod just confirmed that I'm not banned but had been caught by the spam filter. Then he deleted my main post (honestly, given the tension in this subreddit, a public reply to my comment correcting me would have shamed me and would have had a much more powerful effect than deleting my comment entirely). The mod also told me he has deleted THIS POST for lying, so really, I have no idea how you're seeing this.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:31:29
You may be right, there are many questions.
But let's just take a step back and look at the OP and my comment and take them for what they are (because believe it or not, I have zero stake on BCH).
I was only pointing out that it's a little bit disingenuous for OP to say that 8X HASN'T PROVEN that a Bitcoin user can buy a cup of coffee any easier, when the chain is literally days old.
I hope we can at least agree on that. But yes, apart from that, I understand there may be future (and not so distant future) issues.

Serios question: isn't the rate of inflation hardcoded exactly the same as in BTC? In other words, is the higher rate of inflation a consequence of faster blocks? In the end both chains should stabilize at 21M, no?

[This effort]( that by your own words have made Bitcoin be accepted "more than any other crypto", something that was worth repeating by you, in case I had missed it.

That is so short sighted though. I hope that's not the best argument BTC has going for it.
Edit: And the comment is gone. It was something along the lines of "That's because only exchanges accept it".

Congratulations! This is a big step for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:46:28
haha yes but you keep moving the goalpost. Can it or can it not handle 8x more transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:04:42


You're right, and it's great what Bitcoin has achieved in that sense.
That's why it's so strange that it has gone 180 degrees now and being a currency is not a goal. Why go through all that effort of being accepted by merchants if being a currency was never the goal?
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:26:39
Seeing as your original comment was a snarky "only 8X ?" before you quickly came up with something more witty, I'm going to assume you really don't care about the answer, but yes, 8 times more space per block means 8 times more transactions per block all the rest being equal.
Also, one comment below this one, somebody conveniently brought up the spam attack that rose Bitcoin confirmation times to hours while Bitcoin Cash cleared the backlog in one single block.
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:30:09
After talking to a mod, we've come to the conclusion that this has been a misunderstanding. He has restored my comment and I have deleted my wrong edit.
The atmosphere is tense over here, and sometimes mistakes are made. For that it's worth, I have to say that the mod has been reasonable (and patient).
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:42:29
As far as I know, the reason for not implementing 8Mb blocks is not because it wouldn't work right now, but because it's not a good long term solution. So for the time being, I think 8Mb blocks can handle 8 times more transactions, which would be enough to clear BTC backlog in a few blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:16:35
I don't own a single BTC or BCH. I'm looking as an outsider and the level of immaturity on both sides is fascinating.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:30:50
And because it can handle 8x more transactions per block.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:42:31


This comment is so dishonest on your part. It's true that 8MB blocks may pose centralization problems in the future, and it may not be a good scaling solution in the long term, but I don't think anybody doubts that currently 8Mb blocks have gotten rid of the backlog, and have reduced the fees by orders of magnitude.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:19:02
I don't know but the fees are way lower, which makes it a better coin to buy coffee with, which is the comment I was replying to.

Because it takes fucking days!!
You can bet they would wait for confirmations if they were fast and cheap.
Let me ask you something: Where do you draw the line between a transaction that's so cheap you don't wait for confirmations and one where you do? At what price point do you start asking for ID? At what price point do you start asking for a full or partial pre-payment?

Hey, at least bitcoiners got over the "smart contracts are useless" phase. It's a step.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:02:56
When you say the code is not secure, do you mean protocol code or smart contract code? If it's protocol code, that's very interesting and I would like to know more.
Regarding smart contracts, I think that the fact that something is turing complete doesn't mean every program must be super comples. You can still build simple and clear smart contracts with no bugs.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:16:54
Think of the attack surface!!
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:31:43

So don't act like it is normal!
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:07:07
You are putting yourself in an increasingly smaller corner. First, you advocate Zero confirmations. Fine. But now you go and compare it to checks? There's a reason we use Visa!


That's bullshit. One of the main things that Bitcoin is supposed to offer are TRUSTLESS exchanges.
I think the best argument you can use is that this is a temporary situation. Bitcoin is not going to hold off all the alts forever.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:07:20


The fact that a language is Turing Complete doesn't mean that every program must be a mess of code that uses all the functions that the language offers. You can make simple, clear and bug free programs in any turing complete language. Looking at it another way, you can still write buggy code in a language that's not turing complete.
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:03:00

Quality post
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:30:42
When I said nothing remarkable, I didn't mean that nothing bad happened as a result, I meant that 30k pending txs are the norm with bitcoin, so it's intellectually dishonest to point at the exceptional day where Ethereum had a backlog (smaller than bitcoin's btw) and laugh.
The reason why the exchange had to take the wallets down is because there was a massive influx of tx with a high fee (50Gwei), that's way higher than what the exchange was using, so it was being left behind.
I don't think it has anything to do with the UTXO vs account-based models, but correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:02:40

@_date: 2017-06-21 12:49:27
Yes, if you do less, you have less to worry about. But even with that metric, Ethereum has higher throughput *than Bitcoin, and you can also pay higher fees to make it to the next block, what's your point?
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:38:56
Like I said earlier:
Yes, and it's not capped to 21M and it's attack surface is big due to its programmable nature, but those are completely different topics that have nothing to do with the backlog we're currently discussing.

@_date: 2017-06-21 12:41:21
Sure, that's debatable, but that's a different point.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:02:02
Maybe I'm not understanding things correctly so sorry in advance. A smart contract function only runs when somebody sends a transaction to make it run. If you want to make it run faster, send a higher fee with that transaction.
I don't think DApps are meant to be real time at all, so a small delay is expected and accepted.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:21:21


And this


Are incompatible.
Everything fails with too many transactions. Also Ethereum is running at way more than "average scale", it's running more tx than Bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:31:46
Please, let's not be intellectually dishonest. Ethereum has 12k pending transactions right now in the midst of one of the biggest ICO sales in history. This is the highest transaction volume it has ever had (higher that bitcoin's) and the backlog will be 0 in a few hours.
Bitcoin has almost 30k pending transactions with nothing remarkable going on.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:55:42
Yes you probably CAN, but how many $100M companies are actually being funded daily?

Sorry. Saying "nodes need to be taken offline" made it seem like nodes were catching fire everywhere.
One has to admit that the title of the article and the substance of its contents are a bit sensationalistic. Everybody suffered hours of delays, a few exchanges and people publicized it more than others.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:43:14
But Ethereum has near the same tx volume as Bitcoin (actually it has more volume today), and it still has half pending transactions and they resolve faster, so I'd say Ethereum is scaling better.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:52:56
I don't know, how many ICOs per day are done in Bitcoin normally?
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:32:40
I don't believe that they do, but that has nothing to do with Ethereum Network capabilities.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:18:49
I'm not sure but I think it's because the Status ICO put a limit on the fees you can add (50Gwei max). So everybody was putting 50Gwei and it was sort of random. But I think if you add higher fees, you go first, like with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:03:47

I'm happy that it can! That doesn't mean I think those companies should be getting that amount of money. It means that I'm proud of the network's technical capabilities.
I don't know if the companies are scams. Some of them may be, some others may fail sooner or later, and some may survive and help define a whole new economic ecosystem.
About your points 1 and 2, I don't think that's what makes something a scam. You may say they are oportunistic, greedy, but not a scam per se.
