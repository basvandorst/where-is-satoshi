If it’s so easy, why not go put that energy into doing that yourself. Sounds like you got it down to a tee. 
Be the change you want to see my guy. Instead of  chatting from the sidelines

Nope 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:50:11
You are still describing an “exchange”. Doesn’t matter what “exchange”you bring up. That wasn’t my point!!!! I know what the fuck I meant. Obviously there are other ways to get bitcoin. I’m just saying, give them a chance to SCALE UP. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:48:56
Lol I laugh at people like you
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:20:51

There culture is a little different than Americans. They really embrace trading and crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:07:36
I feel like If bitcoin gold forked first or any other bitcoin named coin . It would Be at the same position it is now. I believe bch is only at where it is because it was the first to fork. The first to do anything gets the most attention. Just go Look at the standings of all the bitcoin named coins. There in order of inception. Crazy psychological play lol.
