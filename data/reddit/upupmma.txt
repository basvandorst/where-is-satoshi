Bitcoin received: 16.9360 BTC
@_date: 2016-04-16 21:46:46
are their any websites where I can buy bitcoin instantly via my debit card?
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:46:54
too dangerous not to change it to USD. bitcoin can drop tomorrow and i'd be so screwed, right? 
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:27:37
betting profits (Masters golf tournament). So you're saying that fee is standard then? Ok I can live with that 
@_date: 2016-04-17 19:27:55
because circle kicked me off.
@_date: 2016-04-26 01:26:46
i used local bitcoins for first time last week i got ripped off so bad. bought 2,700$ worth of bitcoins for $3,000 
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:41:30
circle kicked me off. now i use an intermediary wallet 
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:48:44
UPDATE* i just withdrew $7,100 to my bank and there was no fee. I will say though that Circle never charged me to convert to USD. Coinbase on the other hand does. I guess i'll have to live with that since circle barred me. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 18:52:37
yea theyre all selling for like $50 above the real price of BTC. its retarded
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:46:08
yea i had to convert it to USD. i cant expose my money to that kind of volatility! 
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:38:05
i sent airbitz btc wallet to my coinbase USD wallet. you're saying i should do btc to btc from now on?
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:23:59
I had $7,158 in my airbitz wallet. I sent it to coinbase and only $7,100 arrived. $58 fee!!
@_date: 2016-04-17 21:43:32
thanks bud
@_date: 2016-04-22 23:59:49
Yea i ended up paying $480
@_date: 2016-04-17 19:28:15
i like to buy/play with between 2 and 3 thousand dollars worth of BTC.

It'll take a couple days for the funds to settle, after which we'll credit them to your account. 
Once the funds have cleared however, you'll be able to buy/sell/buy/sell immediately, and at zero cost.

I sent 16.9362 ($7,163) and $7,100 arrived.
@_date: 2016-04-17 18:39:28
yea small amounts no good
@_date: 2016-04-16 16:28:06
why? I need a way to buy BTC instantly with debit card like circle allows 
@_date: 2016-04-17 21:45:46
circle allowed me to buy 3,000 worth of BTC every 7 days rolling basis.
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:57:42
circle had ZERO fees. this is my first time using coinbase thats why im surprised by this 
@_date: 2016-03-26 20:40:43
LOL. what else can i use besides circle?
@_date: 2016-03-25 21:05:46
so what wallet will you use now?  circle? 
@_date: 2016-03-25 21:04:20
ok thanks
@_date: 2016-03-26 05:37:39
honestly i buy them and send them to my sportsbook.
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:03:38
ah yes that makes more sense lol thanks
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:09:12
how high are you expecting it to go?
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:58:56
thanks, i need to find alternative sources of income. my job alone is just not cutting it
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:01:54
by holding the coins at coinbase does that expose them to everyday market volatility? 
so each day the price of the coins im holding will go up or down, correct?
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:02:26
sell to whom?
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:27:54
what you make the odds of the rule change being approved?
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:17:51
this was perfect. thank you
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:10:34
when you say trade, do you mean intraday trading like in 15 minute candles and such?
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:56:31
na this 1,000 is extra "play" money
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:56:14
LOL i'm getting married in August!!
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:27:37
$300K per coin?!?!?!?
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:49:03
do you still think BTC is undervalued even with this ETF decision looming?
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:16:28
very interesting, so you can basically trade the funds while you wait.
then once they clear you can move to your wallet.
can you trade on their platform, and short the market if you wanted to?
does BTC work like regular equities?
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:14:00
wouldnt that leave Gemini exposed if the person didnt have the funds in their bank account to cover?
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:10:05
if one BTC is worth  $1,199 how much higher can it go?
did i wait too long to get involved?
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:47:02
also, why would the EFT approval be good? what does it's approval entail for the future ?
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:56:26
do i hold it in my wallet as BTC? Where and who should i buy from?
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:34:37
if you do sell.. how would you go about doing that? 
would you sell locally to someone or to an exchange?
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:59:52
what do you mean by tiny?
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:28:49
can I get a debit card with this?
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:51:10
thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:00:43

@_date: 2017-10-20 03:19:13
$900 bucks for a suit from mens wearhouse? 
may I ask the make of the suit and were alterations included in that price?
@_date: 2017-10-07 17:10:23
that logo looks like a receding hairline.
@_date: 2019-05-23 17:27:15
Why doesn't OP just admit that he was gambling online with bitcoins at a casino?
We're not going to judge you but it looks like Coinbase certainly did.
I for one, am very, very glad I charged back my account with them and beat their asses for several thousand dollars :)
Next time you win some money, send the coins to your wallet, and then sell them for even money on localbitcoins .com or a put a small premium on them for a profit if you can get it.
NEVER send the coins from your sportsbook straight to coinbase or another one of those exchanges. They've got the feds all over their tits. Odds are, you're most likely beat on that money.
