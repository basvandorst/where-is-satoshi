Yes after my coins lost 50% of their value. HitBTC is just a really crap exchange. If you trade on HitBTC, never trade back to your main account. Just let them sit on your trading account. Hope you get access to your coins soon

Jupp noticed that too. Just want to spread the word to a lot of people

Just very frustrated I cant access my money and they call it ‘technical maintenance’. I don’t think that will take more than 48 hours. It’s just a transfer between my main account and trading account. Sounds fishy to me. If you have a solution please let me know

It was a long shot in my eyes but I thought it was possible the fork was still going to happen in the future and then the price would explode

Damn I’m not the only one. I’m sorry to hear that. Hope we will get our money quickly. But I already lost out on some big opportunities

I don’t understand. You think it is funny that people are losing money because of a corrupt exchange?

Indeed a very good trade. Yeah I will let you know. Greetings from Groningen

I’m currently studying in Groningen. I don’t think there are many places that accepts bitcoin, maybe 2 or 3 places. To my knowledge getting a bank account in NL isn’t that hard. ING Bank is the largest bank of NL and I think he will have no problem opening a bank account there. However if you still want your son to spend bitcoin, you can look at alternatives like Monaco. It’s a crypto credit card (most of us use debit cards in NL but there are very many places that accept credit cards). You don’t have to buy their card, it’s totally free, even shipping. You just download their app, fill in the usual KYC, and you can reserve a card. However they haven’t shipped any cards to this day. Maybe this will change around September, when the universities start. Or maybe there is an alternative like TenX or Wirex. Hope I helped!

Ohh yeah that’s right! Didn’t think about that.
