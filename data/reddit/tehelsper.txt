If you are familiar with Case Node or Nodl, it's very similar to that, but we offer a solution for running it on your own hardware and numerous features for free!
@_date: 2019-11-12 02:26:11
That may be true for a number of people with comp-sci backgrounds, but if we want to enable the large majority of people to run their own node we will need better and easy to use solutions.
I believe myNode is a huge step int he right direction, but the ecosystem still needs to get simpler for mass adoption.

Hey, so it's definitely not anonymous. I started myNode and was on SLP  [
You are correct in that you can only verify the images come from me and have not been tampered with by someone else. At some point, you will always be trusting someone - do you trust the Linux distro, what about the packages that are installed or the things received via software and security updates?
I do offer a middle ground - you can audit the source code and build and image yourself via the scripts inside the github repo. No trusting my images, but you get the same functionality without needing to build and setup each individual project yourself.
Using git, clone the repo and run "make setup\_new\_raspi4" and you will be walked through exactly how to build your own image.
@_date: 2019-11-18 03:13:43
I'm the main dev, but a few have contributed. You don't have to use the pre-built images. There are instructions on building it yourself and auditing everything that gets installed. Core apps, like BTC and LND, are PGP verified on each upgrade.
Also, this is not meant to be something to store 100% of your savings. It's meant to offer a full node via an Electrum Server to your other wallets + access to LN to use as more of a "checking" account since it needs to be online.

You can run the VM if you want. Otherwise, yes, you do need *some* sort of hardware to run it on.
@_date: 2019-11-18 13:09:30
It uses electrs, not EPS
@_date: 2019-11-20 22:26:04
If you use myNode, you can access it remotely via VPN or Tor which allows you to access your wallet remotely!
@_date: 2019-11-16 16:40:09
Wait, this actually came out? I donated and never heard anything from them.
@_date: 2019-11-12 01:55:11
I plan to! Glad you like it.
@_date: 2019-11-18 03:14:26
Ha, thanks for the feedback. I may change it one day, but too many boxes have been printed for now.
@_date: 2019-11-18 03:16:38
In my opinion, the first step is to include all necessary software + hardware in one solution and then increase the UI and simplicity from there. Currently, most people don't have access to BTC+LND+Electrum Server+Local Block Explorer etc... in a simple way. They can build it themselves, but requires lots of Linux + Comp Sci knowledge.

You can look at the premium product page to check the feature differences. The payment for Premium is a one time payment.

myNode Discounts!
myNode Premium - $15 Off!
myNode One - $20 Off!
myNode One+ - $30 Off!

myNode and similar alternatives are devices for storing a wallet and are not a miner. I consider it something like a checking account compared to Ledger/Trezor as a savings account.
@_date: 2019-08-03 20:58:03
It's definitely not free, but you should be able to do it for about $100.
Things to get:
- Raspberry Pi 4 kit (with power supply and sd card and case) ~$60
- External USB 3 1 TB Hard Drive
- myNode Community Edition from mynodebtc.com (Free)
That will give you a Bitcoin node, Lightning wallet, Electrum Server, block chain explorer, and more!
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:28:11
Yeah, it's not noticeable on my power bill and I'm 5 or 6 for testing.
At $.12 per kw/hr the cost is about $5 per year.
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:08:01
Ah, yeah a 500GB drive isn't large enough to do QuickSync. You will have to go up to a 1TB drive or disable QuickSync from the settings page.
@_date: 2019-08-28 12:51:09
Take a look at mynodebtc.com for a way to sync a lot quicker. It's got pre built images for RP3 RP4 and Rock64!
QuickSync will save nearly 1-2 months in sync time on an RP3 with an external HDD and get it down to 1-2 days.
It's got a free, open source community edition but does offer premium features, like one click upgrades and VPN access.
Disclaimer - I started the project.

You can try myNode as well. Download it for free at mynodebtc.com
It has:
- Bitcoin
- LND
- Electrum Server
- LND Hub
- RTL
- Block Explorer
- VPN
- Tor
- LND Connect
- Guides
- and more!

We've got instructions for doing it on a myNode device, although it applies to pretty much any Bitcoin node.
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:31:03
Yes, I was assuming someone on Reddit already has Internet service, but in some places home connections do charge per GB. That would have to be taken into consideration.
Blockstream also has satellite options.
@_date: 2019-08-28 12:54:28
Once you get an RPi (I'd recommend and RP4) I suggest you look at running a myNode. It's a free, open source project that lets you run your own BTC node, Lightning node, BTC explorer, Electrum Server and more.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:23:23
I'll look into it. You can always customize your myNode with your own software ask well.
@_date: 2019-10-23 01:00:45
Thanks! Let me know how it goes!
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:21:18
It's not normal. How large is your drive? Is it an SSD? Try joining our Telegram for community support.
@_date: 2019-10-23 01:00:27
Thanks! I don't have an HC2 to test with, so support probably wont come very soon unless someone else can figure out how to port it based on my generic setup guide.
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:58:27
I'd go with the Rock64. It's got a few advanatges. CPU is a bit better, 2x RAM, gigabit Ethernet, and USB 3.0 for the drive.
I also agree with Wasabai, the validation can take 1-2 months for the initial sync. It's better to do that on a PC and copy the files over.
I'm launching a lighting-in-box solution called myNode in about a month and just switched to use the Rock64 for those reasons. It will support BTC, Lightning, Electrum Server, RTL, Bitcoin Explorer and more! Keep an eye out if you are interested!
