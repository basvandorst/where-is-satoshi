If questions, answer DIPS e.g.

Peer-to-peer - no banks or middle brokers, 
Secure - with public key cryptography.

Suggest a better way would be to have the Federal Reserve evolve to a crypto-fiat financial structure, and then they can open the way for all US banks to do the same. This would be much more efficient than each state and bank developing their own tangled web of inefficiency.

If there is Bitcoin regulation in the USA, it should be at the federal level and not state by state. Too much bloated bureaucratic bungling will only move the innovators and their valued time to more friendly countries and jurisdictions. Bitcoin is already the defacto worldwide reserve digital crypto-currency, and the only thing NY can do is move that reserve out of state and maybe out of the USA. Then how will the IRS tax it?

@_date: 2014-10-19 20:45:45
Coinbase has a paper wallet capability. Very easy to use. Just move all or some of your bitcoins to the paper wallet (public key) and you can get them back using the private key. You can move any number of bitcoins from any source to the public key, and then get them back to your coinbase account using the private key. Easypeasy. Coinbase haters, please go away. You are confusing everybody. You can then cash in with a  Coinbase link to your bank account. You can't cash in with a Blockchain account.

State by state regulation and licensing seems to add cost to fund the regulators through more taxes, but with no added value to consumers. For at least the USA, federal level regulation and licensing should be enough.

@_date: 2014-07-27 18:36:52
Short form. Existing laws also apply to Bitcoin. Few, if any, new laws are needed. So why all the fuss in USA? Too many legislators have nothing to do, so instead of reducing taxes and number of legislators they continue writing more laws and reduce our freedoms. See Wiki Red Flag traffic laws.

Fiat is not backed by anything other than the market of the sovereign country printing and minting the currency. What makes Bitcoin different is that it does not have the limit of one sovereign country but is backed by the worldwide market place. Truly the beginning of a new Age of Enlightenment.

Money creation out of nothing continues. The only difference is that it used to be only fiat, and now it's fiat + crypto. Since the cost of crypto is much lower than fiat, eventually crypto is likely to be the dominant financial structure.

Since Bitcoin is a defacto worldwide reserve digital crypto-currency, can't see the value of state by state regulation.

The people most impacted by Bitcoin are the 3rd parties that extract fees for handling fiat currency. Over time those 3rd parties will diminish in size so that costs for transferring value from A to B will also be reduced. Result will be something like the phone companies continuing to operate alongside the Internet. And who cares if OECD calls Bitcoin a currency or not.

@_date: 2015-01-14 21:26:01
Same here. Wow on the 2013 prices.
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:52:27
I'm waiting to buy 5 at $200 each.

Since money is a concept vs printed or minted fiat currency, bitcoin's ledger recorded nature is closest to the concept of money - that is legitimized and sustained by a world market. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:14:53
The last sentence does indicate the phenomenal growth compared to 2012 and early. Redemption but who cares.
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:19:22
CNY is dumping. More Merchants in the game and they dump quickly. Soon the pumpers will see the buy low opportunity.

If you think insolvent, move your stuff to another exchange.
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:20:07
This will likely wake up the bearwhales for a giant sell off.
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:41:43
Looks great so far, and WOW no fees for a few days. Time to buy low and sell high.

Coinbase is one of the best exchanges out there. Hopefully they have better security than Gox and Stamp.
@_date: 2015-05-08 23:42:09
I'd trust BTC before GBTC.
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:29:17
Ho Hum. Nothing very interesting. More Merchant adoption only means more downward pressure on value. Why nothing on the CNY with that being over 70% of bitcoins? Is there more mining and control in China than we realize?
@_date: 2015-01-28 02:31:06
Lots of psycho-babble. He would be great friends with Edison and would enjoy huge DC generators on every corner, with lights only in the homes of the very rich. The hell with Tesla and AC, as Greece goes down the dumper along with Russia's Rubble.

Looking forward to accessing San Fran loc. Based on continued feedback, trust that Stamp and team will not be another Gox and crew.

The Brits can be nasty, smug people. They don't like new. They need something to blame to hide their incompetence.

Get Bitspeculate to work, then BIT/GBTC may have a chance.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:27:04
Buying in 2013 prices seems like a good deal.
@_date: 2015-01-28 02:45:11
Wow, what would you expect from someone who could be put out of business by Bitcoin.

A wake up call for a BearWhale sell off.

Time to move your bitcoins back to Bitstamp and BTC-e? Slovenia and Bulgaria love the new Digital Money technology. A sad story about innovation in America. Maybe Bill Gates will need to help the regulators understand why this technology is so important to the unbanked poor and downtrodden.

When Bitstamp reopened with no trading fees, it seemed to benefit the sellers and the market cratered.
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:18:22
Everyone should have a Bitcoin wallet. Create one for kids and grandkids. Put a little in each. Be cautious but don't be cheap. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 00:40:19
Tough to think about BIT when cohort Bitspeculate has not worked in months.

Wow only 50%. Mine said 150% in 10 days.
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:30:55
Well they tried. The last paragraph on Mt Gox reveals their immaturity (I'm being kind.) They failed to differentiate between onchain and offchain transactions, with most failures occurring in the offchain part of Exchanges. Maybe next round will be better, and for now will NOT include this in my Reference list.
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:56:45
Are you ready to buy?
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:09:26
Wow. Looks like a winner.

Hey NY and CA, Arizona will be the center for all things Crypto.

As likely as $100 or $10. Be ready to buy.

Negative interest. The new standard for fiat.

You must include in your Will or Trust. Include a detailed description of how to access and distribute crypto assets. Include 2FA and multi sign details. Otherwise they will be lost forever and not get to those you care about.

Wow. 95 pages of crypto intrigue. I guess this will be a first for both DOJ and federal agents. Will be interesting to see how and when this gets resolved. Likely will keep lots of attorneys busy and paid with our tax dollars. And oh yes, wonder how many computer files and emails will get lost?

When Fed adds a crypto payment system, Banks will become the key fiat-crypto interchanges.

KYB (Know Your Banker) applies.

I called the Golden Gate Casino in Vegas. They did not know anything about Bitcoin. Would be a big deal if they did accept, but staff needs training. Fee based training is available.

When Fed Reserve adds a crypto payment service, banks will then be able to provide a crypto-fiat interchange service.

Kudos to video creators. Great animation and substance.
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:46:54
Interesting that the banning in China caused the CNY to have the highest volume on bitcoin charts. Will be interesting if the banning in Russia will cause the RUB to INCREASE in volume. That would be great news. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 17:58:03
Bitcoin is great, but credit cards are easy to use and are ingrained in the current culture.

Eventually the banks will be told what to do when Congress orders the Fed to start a Crypto Payment System.

It's publish or perish. And let's face it, false junk narratives get lots of attention, with no retraction or apologies. Hands up, don't shoot.

The best way to replace it is to first integrate with it. Then let the best crypto or fiat win. In business, the cash cows typically fund the next generation of xyz. Even with AC And DC, each found their best place in the electrical world.

Create a wallet in the kids name. Someplace where you don't have to attach a bank account, and be able to withdraw cash with a check. Put in some amount of BTC you can afford. Then give the kid a certificate with all the info needed to access, change, spend or withdraw cash. State on certificate for education, so cash is not withdrawn immediately.

Coinbase is great. If you don't like, use another exchange.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:06:19
Merchants sell, sell, sell their bitcoins - and create the down, down downward pressure. We need more consumers, investors, speculators to buy, buy, buy.

Interesting video. Scary but it doesn't discuss alternatives. And the alternatives could be worse than what's in the video.

Likely part of what they need to do for AML and KYC regulations. Did you exceed your daily limits? Seems that brief answers are what they need - to show due diligence on their part. And is what you are doing legal? If no issue, either answer questions or move your BTC to another exchange.
