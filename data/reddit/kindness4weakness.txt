It's a slippery slope when the govt decides what crimes are. I'm not saying they did anything wrong in this case, but there should be some limits to what they can do with seized assets. I don't think they should be able to profit at all from them. Even if they used the money to build schools, they would just reallocate other money.

Is gdax harder to use or something? Why would anyone use coinbase if gdax is free or cheaper?

Can anyone link or explain how to transfer btc from coinbase to Gemini? I've only been hodling since like September and I really like coinbase because of how user friendly it is...especially the mobile app. 
Does Gemini have an app, and can I easily buy/sell btc with a couple clicks once my account is all set up, like I can with coinbase?

What is the gdax exchange account? I already have coinbase all set up with a small amount invested, bank account and cc linked, and identity verified. 
What is gdax and why would I need it?

Opposite happened to me when buying. Purchase price showed a couple hundred US dollars higher than the front page price. I just figured it was because it's fluctuating so fast.

Coinbase is giving me trouble verifying my checking account. I have only linked my debit card, which can buy but not sell.
Is there another way to cash out some of my earnings this week?

Thanks so much for taking the time to explain this. A few questions: 
How and where does one get started on futures trading? Is it like stocks? If I have a portfolio with a financial advisor can I ask him to put some of my investment into Bitcoin futures? 
Can you give a simple real world example of how one would actually use futures to make money off Bitcoin? Will there be a market ticker for the price of Bitcoin futures that one could use to "buy low, sell high"? Or do you literally select a specific date and gamble what you think the price might be at that time?

Why was it more lucrative to mine in the past compared to now?

They're both bitcoin though, right? After the fork, could one side of the fork increase in value while the other decreases? If they're the same currency, how could they have different values?
