He's giving away $86m in BTC. We need more people like this stepping up. A lot of mental health funding has been consumed by traditional major charities who have done amazing work providing awareness campaigns and resource sites however there is a huge funding hole for real impact platforms and research bodies. We work in this sector and are one of the largest direct to user platforms and it's extremely hard to find people passionate to step and and support new initiatives!

You're amazing Pine and your generosity is refreshing. I encourage you to check out TalkLife, a peer to peer support network helping hundreds of thousands of young people battling the ups and downs of life. We built TalkLife after our own mental health battles. We wanted to provide an upstream, relevant and free alternative to helplines where people could gain the confidence to then reach out to professional support. From that we also built an ML engine out of MIT/Harvard/Microsoft Research that can identify when people are heading towards crisis to launch instant clinically evidenced digital interventions. We hope to provide this to MH charities globally without cost.
We are battling to keep up at the moment and with thousands of new members coming in each week. We simply lack the resources to keep up, especially across training new volunteers and our servers are reaching limits. Our personal savings and angels have kept us afloat for the last five years but we're almost depleted.
We are closely clinically governed with some of the world's top minds in mental health on our Advisory Board plus we maintain a strict impact framework that's all underwritten by a social mission. Our mission and passion is driven by a desire to improve mental health provision in a way that is real and impactful and that makes instant change to someone’s life.
We know you've been inundated, any support would be incredible X We look forward to hearing back on the application we submitted. The community have offered to bake for you for one year- bonus! But in all seriousness, mental health is hugely underfunded and we have a solution that is reaching hundreds of thousands of young people across the globe using innovative technology combined with clinical excellence and a heap of passion. You're support would go directly and instantly to them.

Amazing stuff!! TalkLife could really use your generosity. We’re an early stage intervention helping hundreds of thousands of young people around the world battling mental health, primarily young people battling self injurious behaviours. It’s refreshing what you’re doing! We’ve added more to the form. Thanks again.

Argh that’s amazing! It would change so many young people’s lives!!

The TalkLife community have promised you a lifetime supply of home baked cookies and we're eagerly waiting to hear from you! We could really use some support from people passionate about mental health, we're embarking on some big things including a similar platform for veterans and the VA next year. This is a snippet from one of our users "I love TalkLife, i've not self harmed since I got the app. It got me out of many rough patches and saved my life, or should I say the community saved my life. It helps me when I've got no one to turn to" - Taylah

The team at TalkLife would be forever appreciative of your support! We help thousands of young people every day battling the ups and downs of living with mental health struggles. We’re a place many young people go to talk about self injurious behaviours, suicidal ideation and to see that they’re not alone! 
We’ve been slammed this year and desperately need funding to help hire a few engineers and train up more crisis volunteers. TalkLife has around 550k users and growing quickly. Peer support is an evidence based intervention and a mental health service that young people actually engage with. 
Any help would be so incredible. We’re a small team of ten passionate about this space and determined to show those battling that there is hope!! You can check out TalkLife via the App Stores, thank you for everything you’re doing.

Sit tight mate. The worst thing you can do will be to chase losses. You haven’t lost anything until you sell. Sit tight - it will come back. Investing shouldn’t be emotional- grab a beer.

Yes you can mix and match without any hassle. I’m running AMD &amp; Nvidia without issue. 1070’s are great &amp; Vega 56 if you can get your hands on one. If you can afford it the 1080 ti is a beast but it’ll set you back a little more. Overclockers &amp; Amazon had good sales on 1080 ti’s

BTC &amp; BCH Are going to battle it out all day.. grab a beer and ride the waves. Plus BTG at 7pm GMT.. Who knows how that will impact this.

actually, you can but your returns are not going to be life changing - around $3-$4USD (then factor in your power). Head to Nicehash.com and check out their hardware calculators or Cryptocompare.com to see the ROI on a 1080 ti. I’m using a 1080ti OC and some 1070’s and the 1080 ti does great. 
Edit- this isn’t mining though -it’s selling your hashing power (just before peeps correct me).
