This is obviously much and too complicated to explain. Just have a per transaction $.10 on every transaction that is burnt regardless of size or fee. Now it's only one line of code that everybody could understand.
10 cents times 200,000 transactions per day is $20,000 per day that is being destroyed and going to price per Bitcoin. With that you now have deflation! And the Miner's reward is always increasing in value.
If you want to get really advanced you could have that double at every halving  so that even though the reward is being cut in half the dollar amount per Bitcoin is ever-increasing, but that would require two lines of additional code?

Nothing to do with block reward (that will never change)! We all pay transaction fees now of about 2 cents per transaction wether it be $10,000 or $1 witch is totally separate. Yes we pay 2 cents to move $10,000. With burn fees 75% of that 2 cents is distroyed nothing to do with miner reward, but that money will goto equity. Then fees will be ever changing with supply and demand the difference is with burn fee you can not make fake transactions.

Next phase will be burn fees, fees will go up 400% but 75% will be burned or sent to unusable wallet. No more spam and everybody benefits.

Not really, in fact it increase the the reward. example: 25 bitcoin reward per block stays the same but now the 25 Bitcoin per block will be worth more money because value will be 21 million bitcoin minus 75% of all fees.

Bigger Block size would kill bitcoin next spam attack!
Block size increase is a poison pill and can bog down entire system, without burn fees you can personally stress the system any time you like.  
Lets do the math:
7 per second times 2 cents times in 10 mins = $84 (fees now)
7 per second times 10 cents times 10 mins = $420 x 75% = $315 
With Burn fees miner still gets his extra 2 cents but spammer pay $420 every ten mins but as a bonus $315 goes to equity.
If you give memory before burn fees thats a lot of memory load for bitcoin to carry FOREVER!
Once again this has nothing to do with block reward winner who always gets 100% of the block reward winner (25 BTC). We are talking about the small transaction fee add to every transaction example (200,000 transaction per day times 10 cent (user fee) = $20,000 per day and with 75% burnt means $15,000 destroyed in one day) without taking 1 penny from 25 bitcoin block reward.

No way, being the first mover means being able to introduce burn fees (the holy grail). Most likely
75% of all fees will be burn fees. Yes that means of a 10cent fee 7.5 will be destroyed. That means 
every block every day is eating away at the 21 million. This is true scarcity and every miner, exchange
wallet, and holders can agree (consensus).  Plus no more spam. Block increase will come but first things first. 
Burn fees

China makes up more than 70% of mining and you want them to upgrade then burn fee attached would go along ways to clear up the spam and stress tests. The chinese understand math and the deflation value that would be added to price per bitcoin. More block size without burn fee is a hard sale.

for sure, not just you but other spammers or micro payments will move off line to batch small transactions with off chain wallets to save the 4 cents, freeing up system. Unless you do have a real transaction like buying a tv or receiving $100 then truthfully you will use bitcoin network.
 Wall St fully understands reinvest buy backs and how 21 million minus 75% of all fees makes for super scarcity strong long term value, its a really good. So the miners are now happy, holders are happy, wallets are happy( because they can batch your micro payment on bitcoin network for a fraction of the price you pay today) and the media is happier because every spam attack they must acknowledge the added value every time. Great PR
What did I over look? or What is the down side?

Not true, their payment via block re-ward right now 25 and is in fact shrinking, in fact next year it will be cut in half again so as you so elegantly explained they will have half as much to pay their electric bills that is of course unless they have burn fees which will automatically start adding to the price per bitcoin via scarcity. Don’t be fooled in thinking we are not paying the miners now thru issuing new bitcoins. Going forward putting a 10 fee where everybody enjoys 7.5 cents going to scarcity for good for everybody except spammers. We all know that bitcoin is designed to of from issuing new bitcoins to evolving to fees but must have some sort of burnt fee attached to rules/law to make sure everybody benefits and is the only way in which the system can't be gamed to one side.

Are you sure? Do you know the average amount per transaction is under a dollar? It would push 90% on these penny transactions off line to be bundled like the casinos have done.

1? Please elaborate on the having being no big deal because from what I understand that mining is so expensive that minors have to sell on a daily basis just to cover their electricity. So if that is somewhat true wouldn't  they're only be half as many for sale per day?
2? I know for stocks efficient market theory says that all future knowledge is priced in to the stock or issue. So when most people calculate 21 million, if you do count 21 million then it's not inflationary right?
3? If there was some type of fee that took portions of the Bitcoin out of circulation forever wouldn't that be now considered deflationary?

its a patch on both xt and core that changes nothing but rather adds burn fees in addition, much like fees now are in addition. But the real question is will it work or is there flaws? This seems like a safe guard that only takes affect if there is an attack or mass adoption?

Doesn't really matter if he was born yesterday, are any of the points true?
1. Will the daily supply of fresh Bitcoin be cut next year?
2. What kind of a effect economically would a destructive fees have on the value of Bitcoin? 
3. Would it be technically deflationary?
4. Will the next fiscal year have a possibility of accountants confirming that Bitcoin is indeed a true commodity according to the IRS? 
If so that would be a vast difference from last year of it barely being legal?

I would not sell at $10,000!
The age old question of when? back at $300 or maybe $350? The problem of trying to hit tops and bottoms is only the past can help no one dare call before hand. Not to add mount taxes from selling. As Buffet says hold forever is best, then you can skip the tax man.
