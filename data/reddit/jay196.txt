Mahin Gupta started BuySellBitco.in, India’s first Bitcoin Company, in early 2013. Then due to violation of foreign exchange regulations it was raided and lot of stuff happened. Then Mahin Gupta along with other two guys relaunched it as Zebpay. So technically it still is the first!

I would suggest you to keep the funds in a mutli-sig online wallet.
You can try Coinbase.com/vault. You don't need to download anything!

Yes you can go and pick up your gold bars if you happen to live in Singapore and maybe they even started sending it to people directly!
@_date: 2016-06-25 17:02:10
No, they can't. They are of fixed amount. A smart contract controls the distribution of it so even if they want they can't do anything.

Yes, just go to coinbase.com and a wallet for you will be created. Just copy the receiving address from Coinbase and send your bitcoins from Core to this new address you just created on Coinbase.
First try with small amount to make sure it works!

The main thing is security! Keep your keys safe or if you use any online wallet then I would suggest you to turn on 2FA or put your btc into a multi-sig wallet!

That's awesome! Mind sharing a png or jpeg? That would look so good as my wallpaper :)

Is this real? Much WOW! *To the moon*

In three years I guess you'll have a whole lot of big players into the electric car segment and also don't forget about those self driving ones. Selling 1 car would be a nice decision I guess...

You realise that Pied Piper is Storj/Sia/Maidsafe right?
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:17:30
Scholarships or anything like that?

Niantic started at Google, but they have [parted away]( since Alphabet became the parent company. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 14:45:53
To everyone saying Niantic is an Alphabet subsidiary; it's [not](
@_date: 2016-07-10 19:31:10
Yes it's like Sia/Maidsafe/Storj but with BTC.
