Good interview.

The store shows being active  It may have a connection problem, though. It doesn't connect to Shapeshift at all. It connects with OpenBazaar on &amp; off.  I'll play with the network some more. I can see how denial of service could be a problem if a store IP was targeted. Security is local. If you shd find the store I'd appreciate it if you'd post here.

Maybe I need to port forward like a bitcore node. I'll try to set up port forwarding maybe tomorrow. Have a support ticket in. It's likely something obvious. I read the destructions after the install rather than when I should have at the beginniij ng. And that's the thing. Tinkerers &amp; dabblers like me show up after a protocol has been implented, when good-enough-to-try and getting-interesting intersect.

It may be too early for small items but surely not for a reputable startup that handles books &amp; other resale items. 
All I want to do is sell a book collection online for cryptocurrency. Can this be that hard? Where is the Ebay of crypto? 
Craig's list offers a "cryptocurrency OK" option but still it's not a crypto market. Shopify is overkill for my needs. Tried to sign up for Coinbase Commerce. Didn't succeed. No idea why. 
Found 10 best markets that accept crypto, but I don't like to swim with sharks on the dark net. Reddit has a subreddit that is interesting but small I think. Some were a poor fit. Square Cash App looks interesting.
Suggestions anyone?

Do you have a store on openbazaar? I'm in the process of setting up one thanks to your link. 
I'm excited becus OpenBazaar is a young market where the best names for stores are still available. 
My store name is "BookAttic." It is already in use on most commercial sites. My books are more mainstream than most but still garage-sale like. They're a bit weird sitting among graphic novels but the products on OpenBazaar are so diverse it fits in.
I am an early adopter. I usually pick up on a concept a short time before it breaks into mainstream. Not sure if these books will sell but that's okay. I want to be one of OpenBazaars customers before it becomes a household word.
I believe OpenBazaar is going to catch on like wildfire given time. It looks like a decentralized Ebay or fledgling Amazon. I hope they do offer tokens 4th quarter 2018.  Thank you for the tip.

Hey this interesting. Researching it now. Thanks much.

Thank you for the heads up on my store. Maybe the fact that I didn't stay online long after I set it up slowed it down?  It's propagated by peer-to--peer-seeding so not sure how fast that works when a store node is offline. Still, yes, it's a very interesting project.

Question. Did you run UPnP on your node? 
@_date: 2018-05-03 10:39:55
Post about it if you setup LN  pls. It interests me, too. Setting up LN was my ultimate goal. By the end of this year there should be a lot improvements on LN wallet. Tried to read the LN whitepaper. The Bitcoin whitepaper was more or less straight forward. I got lost in the lightcoin white paper, but the actual implementation looks doable. Will your friend continue running the node while you're gone?
@_date: 2018-05-03 22:37:19
Thx. I haven't used UPnP yet but it is tempting.
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:58:26
is my speed okay it doesn't look fast enough. My download is 119 upload 12.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:36:03
Well that's reasonable. I tested it several times.  After the post I tested it again with bitcoin node running. The speed was 89.75 download and 11.50 upload. What was the diiference? Thx. Pls post if you have any change in yours.
@_date: 2018-05-04 23:37:16
*The ping was above 700,000.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:52:38
Okay, thx will definitely check it out. Taking a 24 hour break. The first time I compiled Bitcoin node a month ago seemed to work with fewer glitches or maybe I didn't see them. Problem with me is that I know enough Linux networking to work through a basic problem but lack a good grasp of Linux to solve finer points. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 23:23:06
Yes! Bitnodes.earn is where I tested it. It was good. My rank is last. :). Still have 6 or less inbound. Sometimes a node will show a ping increasing fast. One or two nodes went up to 700,00 ms. I wasn't sure what was going on so I disconnected them. 
We don't game or use anything that needs UPnP. The HowToGeek article was good. I use Win10 offline. 
About a month ago I transferred files with an OTG cable and a new Samsung USB drive from my phone to my laptop. Malware jumped to my offline laptop. I cleaned my phone out and deleted Ms Note folders &amp; files that the virus had attached itself to. 
So UPnP is not something I want to enable. That was a WPS button that wasn't disabled. I will take a look at the ransomware app. Again thx.
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:47:53
okay thank you misread it
@_date: 2018-05-04 16:35:35
I have 5 in 8 out. Thx for replying about UPnP. Just got it running w/out UPnP. It took me forever. Hardware is easy for me I understand it, but I struggle quite a lot w/ networking. 
I had settings wrong on the router. Decided that if I had to run UPnP I'd quit trying to run a full node. I didn't want my family open to unnecessary risks. 
My old computer is proud to be listed as a bitnode, reachable by port 8333. I do have 
The 4 CPUs run under 10%. Memory useage at 10-12%. Download speed 0.00 Mbits. Upload 12.30 Mbits. 
Shd. have more inbound but maybe those will increase. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 00:03:31
Thanks for your help. My inbound now has 22 so now I think it's going to be okay.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:38:31
I am new to running bitcoin node but that was the thing I couldn't see much movement in data. The traffic graph was below 10 kbs. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 12:57:41
The store is listed on Bazaarbay which is retiring. When I searched OpenBazaar it was not found. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:38:32
You have 8 outbound connections or peers to begin with. These only update your node &amp; wallet. If you want more connections to help the network then allow incoming connections. Port forward port 8333 to the device IP with Bitcoin on it. Make sure your firewall allows incoming connections. 
@_date: 2019-11-02 21:36:58
The best way to understand bitcoin is to buy bitcoin. After you get an account buy small amounts like $10 over a month or so. Be prepared for the dollar value to fluctuate while the amount of bitcoin accumulates. It makes you aware of the rhythm of the market. It's fun and you learn about bitcoin faster.
@_date: 2018-10-02 12:41:32
My store finally came up a phone search. Thank you for the reccomendation.

Ivan on Tech is a cryptocurrency educator. He is one of the YouTubers whose channel was taken out over Christmas. His channel isn't a ponzi scheme. He's well respected. 
This appears to be done in a targeted way. I'm not sure if it's a step-in-line gesture or a step to gag cryptocurrency information. 
Ivan Lileqvist, from Stockholm, Sweden was banned for one video done in 2018.  The act of banning during Christmas is calculated &amp; unfair to Ivan and his 200,000 plus followers.
@_date: 2019-12-25 21:39:18
Sounds like you aren't informed.
@_date: 2019-12-30 15:05:16
Ever think you guys are ageist? Just a bit?
@_date: 2019-12-25 20:46:21
Ivan on Tech, YouTuber, who broadcasts daily about cryptocurrency, from Stockholm, Sweden is gone today. He's one if the top bitcoin educators. He has around 200,000 followers. What is wrong with YouTube? He discussed the ban of a fellow YouTuber on one if his last episodes.
@_date: 2019-12-25 23:32:14
And I could add Boxmining. Why has he been banned?
@_date: 2019-12-25 23:49:14
I doubt that because he was part of a larger purge. FYI it's time to consolidate rather than be tribal. It 's more likely because he supports Bitcoin than any other coins.
