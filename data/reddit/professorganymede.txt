What are the things you need to know and do to make money in a bear market?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:23:02
I already did and didn't find the answer, which is why I asked it here.  So a helpful comment would be nice.  
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:50:27
What have you done to prepare for this?  What does this mean for crypto currency? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:17:40
I'm going to tag this comment to determine whether or not you are the profit.

Does this apply to other crypto?  If I convert Tether into ETH is that taxable? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:58
Cool.

So I'm trying to keep some funds aside to buy the dip as Bitcoin corrects but I don't know where to keep my crypto in the mean time. 
I thought just holding my crypto as Tether was fine but apparently Tether is scary.  So I'm looking to get my funds out of tether.  But I also don't want to get taxed on my crypto by converting it to USD.  So this is a tax question. 
If I send bitcoin to Gdax and convert it into Fiat, and just keep my USD on Gdax do I have to report that as taxable gains?  Or do I only have to report the funds when I transfer my USD into my American bank account?  
If you can link at least 1 source with your answer that would be great.  I'm not trying to screw with the IRS.

It seems like almost no one profits from trading no matter how old and experienced.  I'll be holding and buying with my main funds but I'll throw about 100 in for fun to practice day trading as a hobby.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:31:54
I did take the time by asking.  I put in the effort just in a different way and I got the answer I was looking for.  Work smarter not harder. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:44:26
Ok thanks. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:44:24
Thanks a lot for taking the time to do this. 
You'd have 433 less profit and .16 less bitcoin as well?  Is there a way where you can keep gaining more bitcoin but never actually risking the new bitcoin you gain? 
So what I mean by that is that in the scenario you laid out it seems like we gained .16 bitcoin.  But in order to invest further I'd have to risk the bitcoin we gained?  So we are out of money to invest unless we waiger more bitcoin? 
If I take 1000 fiat and invest in bitcoin, can I get to a point where I have made such a profit that I net bitcoin but still have money to invest without risking the bitcoin I gained?  Hm...maybe like if I gain .16 bitcoin I use the .06 bitcoin that I gained to invest more and then keep the .1 bitcoin for long term?  So even if I lose my next investment I still have an extra .1 bitcoin since my initial investment?  
Don't know if I'm making much sense here but hopefully you understand what I mean.

I live in Michigan USA.

Yea that would be the goal.

Some College, 27.  Never very good at math.  I could definitely do the math if I wanted but it's easier to just ask.  Hell I work at a bank.  
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:31:32
That's a shame.  What I'm talking about is long term trading.  Let's say that Bitcoin goes to 10,000 within the next 5-10 years.  In that time period there are going to be large dips and pumps.  Would it be benefitial to trade a portion of your bitcoin every few months?  Because if bitcoin eventually goes up to 10,000, in that time your initial investment will be worth much more.  Could you wait for that 50 to 80 percent increase then sell at the 30-40 percent fall for a profit?  That fall may take months or years but if it worked and it did happen, would it be worth it?

Well my dollars have been moved to a bitcoin trading site.  Since people are suggesting moving their bitcoin off the site I was wondering how that would effect my dollars since my dollars are being kept by the site while I buy bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:00:33
I just transferred US dollars from my bank account to GDAX.  Is my US dollars ok?  I have a few pending transactions open but none have been filled yet.  
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:17:09
That is risky of course.  But if my strategy worked would it even be worth it.  Let's say I buy 1 bitcoin when it's worth 2000 fiat.  I keep a half of that for long term holding and then use the other 1000 worth of bitcoin to try and net more bitcoin.  
If the price jumps by 50 percent, I sell my 1000 worth of bitcoin and now have 1500 fiat. Then eventually the price goes down 30 percent and I rebuy with the money I gain from the buy, have I really gained anything?  I mean...seems like I've gained 20 percent extra bitcoin.  Lets say I do this successfully 5 times, will I have really gained much or will it have been better to just held at my initial investment when bitcoin was worth 2000?  
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:24:05
That's what I was thinking about doing.  Just trading for fun. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:20:34
I won't be day trading.  It'll be more like month trading. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:32:35
But how does the math work out?  Humor me.  
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:22:21
So to you the potential rewards isn't worth the risk when you are relatively confident the value of your cryptocurrency is going to rise?  
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:48:49
My money is already there.  I haven't actually bought coins yet.  I have a few limit buys I've set up but I haven't actually purchased coins.  So are my dollars save being left in Gdax for the limit buys?  
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:11:10
Cool thanks.  
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:18:54
Is that better than just holding at 1800?  I'm having troubles with the math.  
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:36:07
Buy and sell alt-coin with the goal of buying more bitcoin?
