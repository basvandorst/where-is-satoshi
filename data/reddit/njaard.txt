QR codes have error checking in them. And Bitcoin addresses have VERY STRONG error checking. It is very difficult to accidentally get an incorrect but valid address. Don't worry about it.

Armory has a bitcoin-qt downloader and installer built-in.

Run memtest86 on your computer. Armory would not cause bitcoin-qt to fail.

Hey Farhod, I hope to contribute now and again as well to your efforts. Maybe we can migrate to pure C++ one day now that we have no bosses.

You can transfer this via IBAN without going through Bitcoin. I'm pretty sure by EU regulation they can't even charge you for it because there's no currency exchange.

Some nodes like to fix transactions with "Big S" values on your behalf. I can't tell if this is one of them.
The version of Armory that is about to be (or just has been) fixes the Big S problem. Nothing to worry about.

Since I don't have a printer, what code is both convenient to generate, and short enough to write by hand that I could use as a savings account to put in the safety deposit box?
And how do I access the data?

Well, this is easy, just write it down thrice and test it. But where do I get the private key from bitcoin-qt?
And how do I import the private key with bitcoin-qt?
