after the 2011 hack, the database of user names/(insecurely hashed)passwords was leaked. As a result, old user accounts were locked, and tighter checks were applied to claim them. Some of those accounts were from the time BTC was worth les than 0.005$ (yes, new users, that's right - less than half a cent per bitcoin).  
As far as  I understand, some of those users were not able to claim their BTC at all: the accounts were registered with email only, all details necessary for claiming them forgotten.  So, Mark just used the hack as an excuse to make those BTC unclaimable and thus expropriated them.
Any idea of how much funds were there in those ancient unclaimable accounts?

So it is an open source software that relies on people not modifying the source to con others? I can't see what can possibly go wrong here...

I'm not arguing with OP, but I think it's fair to link to the original post by Gregory that Mike replied to (showint what Mike did not quote)

my guess is the word is Tautology. 
Then the left xxx should be the same as the right xxx. That limits the number of words to bruteforce to a couple of milliions. Still my JS  script finds it too difficult (crashes the browser)...
Anyways, if you find the key with the above tip, please send half the bounty to me 1JemY8PgKhcudUDzm7CqdWtHQ66iPNT6gS
