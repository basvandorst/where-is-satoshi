Does anyone know where in Mexico is Volabit located?

Just need to be patient.  If it works in the U.S., it will eventually be accepted outside the U.S.

Hoarding goes on when price is shooting up.  Price has somewhat stabilized in the past few months, so it looks like people are using Bitcoin for how it was intended to used:  currency.

According to Boston University, the laws or regulations pertaining to online gambling is related to how much money the government can make or lose, not on morals or the pretext of protecting consumers.  See:

Interesting that Vancouver has 7, when it's a significantly smaller city than London.

If the NSA truly did this, why would they disclose that they can track anyone down with stylometry?
If they disclose this, people will try to hide themselves, such as with the author's recommendation to write without fingerprints. Why would the NSA want this?
Therefore, I don't know if this story is true. But it should makes a great story.
Somebody should make a movie about Satoshi.
The movie can be about the IRS, NSA, Federal Reserve and ECB searching for Satoshi.  They keep finding imposters or false leads.  At the end of the movie, the camera pans away from these investigators and zooms in on a guy wearing shades, sipping on his martini and surrounded by beautiful women.  He gives a small smirk, a symbolic middle finger to the fiat dictators.  He gets up, gets into his Lambo and drives away.

Good points.
Former JPMorgan managing partner, Tom Lee, told everyone to take the other side of Jamie Dimon.
Morgan Stanley CEO, MacQuarie Analyst and Josh Brown of CNBC revolted against Dimon.  Even Dimon's daughter bought Bitcoin.

Yes and no. Cryptos will grow, like the internet did. Bitcoin will continue going up in price, only if it can maintain its lead against other cryptos. The risk is that if a significantly superior coin comes along, it can dethrone Bitcoin. Yahoo was the top dog in the early 1990's, until Google came along. Internet Search exploded but Yahoo died.
