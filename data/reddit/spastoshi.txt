If I win I guess some of them coin are yours ? Well that would make the win all the more sweeter, so how you enjoying your new shitcoins butfinex gave you to replace your now gone coins ? Did you lose much ? How it feel to sit there and be able to do nothing about the situation? You got robbed and there nothing you can do about it, you type comment after comment about butfinex and it completely pointless. You are pointless, you lost and your constant moaning about it is hilarious, what do you think you will accomplish? The butfinex guys are laughing at mugs like you, they took your coin and there is nothing you can do about it, just sit there typing comments on reddit , what a loser.

Ha ha, thanks for the laugh, don't usually bother commenting but you trader guys are brilliant. The thought of you arrogant assholes losing money just brightens my day. A baker makes bread, a farmer produces food, a cobbler makes shoes, what the fuck do you pricks make ? Money ? $ is all you care about, capitalist pigs of the worst kind, the world would be a much better place without you, please chase your losses, lose some more then please come back and post about it so I can laugh some more.

Dear I would like to make you aware I have never ever stuck my little sister's hairbrush up my ass for money, this alone would have made me a more worthy winner, this girl already has a good source of income in the "up ass hairbrush scene" while nobody wants to pay to see my chubby arse.

Don't let them freak you out about them possibly being stolen and the FBI looking for you. Read up on paper wallets and get them coins safe. Sit on them for a couple years and see what happens, my guess nothing will happen.
