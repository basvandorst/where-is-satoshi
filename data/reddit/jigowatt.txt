What's your point? The Dow Jones is not a currency.

The biggest 'negative' of Bitcoin for some people is also the biggest positive for others: It is very difficult to regulate and track Bitcoin. At no time does a transaction need to pass through a government or banking entity for approval. This scares a lot of people because, although it really is more of a natural way to use currency, it is different than the way things currently work, and people are afraid of change.
No country can simply print more Bitcoin to fix a problem in the same way they can print more money. Yes, you can mine more, but mining large amounts is far, far more difficult that printing fiat. The advantage of this is that, as a world currency, it is not tied to a single country's economy. This makes it more stable.
You mentioned market volatility, but that is actually less of a problem than most people realize. Bitcoin is in its infancy. In the early days, prices were highly erratic. That's not unlike any other new currency which is finding its place in an economy. Bitcoin **was** an investment for a short while, but that was only because the prices were volatile. Bitcoin is becoming more stable as time goes on, and it is changing from an investment opportunity to the currency it was designed to be.

He kept an unencrypted wallet in his Dropbox.
He did not split the coins between multiple wallets.
This could have easily been avoided. Now it's going to be very, very difficult to retrieve the coins, and anyone who is capable of doing so will not be in a position where they need to actually return them to their owner.

That was a very funny post, Ben.
From now on, I will refer to you as "Bitler". It's a portmanteau of "Bitcoin" and "Hitler", if you didn't quite catch the joke.
Well, I'm sure you have a lot of other wacky jokes and other hijinks to plan, so I bid you adieu, Bitler.

You don't profit from convincing others to use Bitcoin.
Not a pyramid scheme.

Aaaaand nothing accepts Titcoins.
But you didn't check before posting this article.

Bitcoin is meant to be a new currency. Not a game for speculators. 
Its relative stability is a step in the right direction. It means that people can now start using it without worrying about losing all of their coins' value in a crash.

What is a kid supposed to do with this?

I always felt that LootCrate tried too hard to be "hip" and "geeky xD". They mix so many fandoms and hobbies, they end up being too generic to please anyone.

Chuck Norris is the only person who could shut down Bitcoin with a 49% attack.

You need to wait for the transaction to verify and the blockchain to be downloaded by your client.

And there's Nimoy, too.
Now I'm sad again. Thanks a lot, OP.

uTorrent is harmful anyway. They've completely sold out to third parties and law enforcement. Torrenters should move on to better clients like qBittorrent.

It's definitely [down]( How long has it been like this? This sort of thing happens to websites quite often. The problem is usually corrected within a few hours.
