Can confirm, bought tron at the top lol. Still have bitcoin but I have been playing around with alt coins. 
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:08:45
Not selling has the same effect on price as buying
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:48:02
Lol yeah I’m with you I put a shitload into it quickly cause we just couldn’t lose the last 4 or 5 months. I’m well over half of my network into it now and I realized it is a bit reckless. I was planning on taking down profit at 20 to get my basis down and bit and start playing with house money. I will still hodl but I think it’s still lower my total position is the financially responsible thing to do 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:13:17
Is is the because of how much its appreciated lately? If so, what percent of your net worth is your cost basis? That might be a more fair measure.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:41:17
Damn are you wealthy and can afford to live off that 10 percent, or are you just all in haha?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:44:29
I had my trezor plugged in ready to go earlier too lol and then I thought I better go check Reddit and hear from my fellow Hodlers. Now I feel better. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:44:13
Haha do you even get paid in bitcoin?

If you’re in the US, where were you able to short bcash? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:35:16
Interesting, that seems pretty high. If you don't mind sharing, where would you categorize yourself on the spectrum of wealth? And also what's your thinking behind putting some much of your wealth into bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:08:27
That’s too bad, but all things considered not too expensive of a lesson. Hang in there. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:54:24
I think they mean the price usually dips right after they buy due to bad luck.

Lol the vault feature is extremely useful for forced holding. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:50:19
Traders realize gains whenever they buy and sell. If you sit back and just hold you never realize a capital gain and incur a tax liability. Furthermore, traders pay short term capital gains which are taxed higher than long term (investments held more than a year). 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:41:45
Yup that’s exactly when I got in the game. Right around 3.5 or something I think it was. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:37:19
Lol glad I woke up after it hit 11k. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:16:50
Or like how I’m kicking myself for not selling at 19k plus for the second time last weekend. But at the time I didn’t want to miss another bullrun. It’s a been a big lesson in the futility of timing the market except buying on big dips. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:29:57
Short term capital gain rates are just your normal marginal tax rate, so there isn’t any advantage. It’s certainly still quite a grey area, but I don’t see any reason why you couldn’t get long term capital gain treatment for bitcoin held over a year. I’m sure congress &amp; the IRS will eventually give us some guidance. 
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:15:16
interesting its actually almost identical to the total return of the sp500 since sept 2017
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:34:40
His trading pattern is. If all he claims to know is it’ll be 50 he should be buying all the way up to 50. But he’s not. Because he thinks he knows it’ll go down first.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:18:09
You pay fees to Robinhood in the spread they just don’t show it to you.
@_date: 2019-06-17 22:51:19
Yeah that would of course hurt more I’m just saying bitcoins volatility makes it much easier to stay the course in the broader market
@_date: 2019-06-17 22:40:51
Haha this time around I will be taking some profits at certain levels
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:41:26
If it’s going to 50 why aren’t you buying at 12-13?
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:31:37
Ah so he not only knows for sure it’s going to 50 but he knows for sure it’s going to 8-9 first.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:55:30
What if it doesn’t go to 8 or 9 and instead skyrockets to 25? You just missed out on a ~2.5x return. 
You might “know” it’s going to 50 in the future, but that says nothing about knowing what happens on the way there.
@_date: 2019-02-21 07:51:04
Lol this same thing happened to me after I sent my friend money with the caption “havana ooh nana” after we ate at Cuban restaurant
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:13:56
haha thats the exact same as me. Only bought, never sold.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:28:09
All he said was he 'knew for sure' it's going to 50k. Now we are supposed to believe he 'knows for sure' itll get to 8-9 before it gets to 50? His model is just 'the price goes up before the halving'. What basis does he have for these arbitrary buying target? He's provided nothing to support that. And I won't even get into how ALL the parabolic runs are not even close to the halving. 
If all he claims to 'know for sure' is bitcoin is going to 50 he should be buying non stop up to 50. He could put in his order to sell at 50 and never look at the price again and go do something fulfilling instead of sitting at a computer watching price action, pretending his maximizing profits with some random buy targets on the way up. 
He shouldn't even have a trading limit if he 'knows for sure'. But he does, because in reality he has no idea what is going to happen. 
His shilling his shit bullshit strategy on the premise he was a Wallstreet investor and he even has the audacity to do an AMA as if he's some maverick crypto trader, as if his bet on 50k is somehow more informed than everyone else who ever posted about bitcoin will moon.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:29:19
yeah that's cool so do I, but neither of us a doing an AMA as if we are trading geniuses really my point.
@_date: 2019-06-17 22:21:30
I’m glad I’ve had the experience of holding through the roller coaster it makes a sp500 market correction of 10 percent laughable insignificant
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:20:50
Now that’s good advice
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:36
lol Bitcoins cyber Monday sale is two days late
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:08:18
So why not just buy up to your limit, throw your 50k sell order on the books and call it a day?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:54:17
LOL you didn't have to wait long
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:12:08
I gained far more sitting around doing jack shit watching it skyrocket.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:52:17
The prices goes up until people are willing to sell.... it’s not coinbase “selling bitcoin” it’s other users
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:27:10
Yeah which is generally every two weeks or so 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:38:31
Needed to read a post like this after these big sell offs, thanks 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:04:23
The difficulty is adjusted up or down depending on the amount of transactions on the network. Reduce the difficult and costs go down, making mining profitable again. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:04:56
Do you have any more advice on how to do that? Like what to say to make them compensate me?
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:47:29
How can Gemini not detect an unusual sign in during these attacks?
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:48:44
Fuck I realized I used the google browser instead of safari on my iPad which has Adblock 
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:02:53
That’s exactly what I thought. I don’t know anything about how it works, but I guess the fake site first gets my pw which it uses to logon to Gemini, and then Gemini pushes the notification to my phone which I feed back into the phishing site?
I also don’t get how they could automatically transfer out bitcoin as I have no api access setup to my account. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:14:36
Isn’t it because I still have to enter the code that’s sent to my phone? Gemini pushes the notification via Authy to complete the login by entering my 2FA code. 
What I wish is that sending bitcoin required 2FA. I think that would have saved me. 
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:44:37
I got phished on Gemini early in my crypto days luckily for only 700 or so. Bought a Trezor the next day. It was terrifying how easy it was to get phished.
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:50:34
At the end of the day it just buys you more time to detect a hack as its a 48 hold if I remember correctly. 
But hardware wallets are still far more secure.
