This address received a huge volume of transactions in a short amount of time while most of the BTC exchanges are down.  They all show up on here currently.  
That account received an exact 50BTC share out of a large volume transactions totaling tens of millions of dollars, all pretty much within seconds of each other around 2013-04-12 04:07

Not really.  It started back when price was steadily rising. Trend would have needed to be on a slow decline for a bit before today for that to be the case. It's more likely bullish.

Because of the "distributed" aspect of them. They are usually conducted by a network of computers infected with a Trojan horse virus that someone can control to use the computers do something for them. Spamming emails, DDoS attacks, etc. It's hard to distinguish the real traffic from the bots because the virus is distributed around the world on real personal computers on many legitimate ISPs.

Based on my knowledge of how things trend in stock markets, this is going to resume the tend the stock was on throughout the last few weeks.. I'm expecting to wake up seeing 300-375 trading price minimum

If it starts going down past the low of the last last oscillation then it may be time to sell...
EDIT: Looking at it currently, it is giving every indication that we're on the way back up. I'm going to go to bed and wake up for some entertaining news either way.
EDIT2: Yeah, it's going back up with a fair level of certainty.  Impossible to make any predictions either than that.. If I had to guess, back over 200 by tomorrow and steadily climbing until at around 300-400 by Friday evening.
