This is a frustrating choice of a fancy wheel re-invention over existing, working technology:
[Freenet]( has been in development for 16 years, [and offers more of the features which OpenBazaar needs](
IPFS is barely 2 years old, and isn't even anonymous yet - which is a core feature of Freenet.

That's a feature, not a bug.
The fiat transfer happens between the regular bank accounts of buyer/seller, you don't have to deposit money at Bitcoin.de.
This makes trading faster and ensures you only have to trust them with the cryptocurrency, not also with the fiat.
And if you open a bank account at their partner bank "Fidor" then you can do instant trading with the bank transaction happening automatically.

A huge security issue with the existing Trezor wallet is *restoring* of a backup:
- A trezor backup is a password consisting of random English words (BIP38 or whatever). *Generating* the backup is secure: At first use, the Trezor displays the password in its screen, and you write it down. So it never hits a networked computer, and thus is a offline backup.
- However, *restoring* only works by using the Trezor wallet software on a computer, which is a **website**. So you need an online machine to restore a backup, which is very insecure. This is because the Trezor has no buttons to enter anything. It could stay like that if there was a proper wallet software which works offline. IIRC, Electrum is working on that, but its not officially deployed yet. It would still suck though: IMHO the password never should hit a regular computer which has a harddisk, the probability of it leaking to disk is too high. If your device included a camera, it might be possible to scan the password from a sheet of paper. Maybe have the user write it down in a special machine readable format. Or have the device be an USB hub so it can be connected to a printer to print out the password + QR code. This would also compensate for people having a sloppy handwriting, which could cause backups to be unreadable by themselves after some years.

Lets say you have a loaf of bread and I have a loaf of bread. Lets say we can both survive for a week by eating it.
If you cut your bread into 7 pieces, and eat one each day, you can live for a week.
Now if I cut mine into 70 pieces instead, does that mean that I *cannot* live for a week from it because it's "buying power" has decreased? Of course not. If I stick 10 of my mini-pieces together then I have 7 the same size as yours. The total amount of bread which I have is still the same!
So I can still live a week from it.

You don't *need* a blockchain to publish rules set by you somewhere. All you need is public-/private-key cryptography to proof that the message is from you, and a place where to store this. And the fridge, as it is online, can serve as the ruler to decide who first offered to fulfill the order. You wouldn't want an offline fridge to order stuff anyway. Imagine the angry customers who shitstorm your hotline because the fridge which they threw in the trash 3 months ago is still ordering stuff!
Of course the article claims that the vendors wouldn't want to provide centralized servers for storing the table of which fridges exist (so the supermarkets have a place to look them up) for decades and instead use a P2P network for it, so they can abandon the maintenance. But this is nonsense for 2 reasons:
1) If you stop publishing updates to a software which is connected to the Internet, it will get hacked. All software has bugs, and all software has security issues. If you stop maintaining it, things will go wrong. You cannot expect to push out a software which people use on a public network for decades without updates. This will never work.
2) Again, conventional P2P networks can do it. You do not need a blockchain.
@_date: 2014-10-20 10:36:16

I've heard the "criminals are in it" complaint a lot, but to me it seems like the people who this aims at are not actually convicted yet, just hated a lot by the community - for example Mark Karpeles. Is that true or are there any actually convicted criminals in the foundation?
Of course you are free to call anyone a criminal if you like to, but a foundation cannot just kick out people because you do so - they have to be actually convicted about something. (And even then it would have to be something which contradicts the interest of the foundation. You wouldn't kick Edward Snowden out of a pro-privacy foundation just because the USA convict him due to his whistleblowing.)

The reason why this is ultra interesting is the following: It is futuristic as hell yet does happen today.
Why? Imagine a future where Bitcoin is the world currency. Then you want to be able to receive payment with Bitcoin *everywhere* immediately. So you need the blockchain. And to have it available everywhere, you would want to run a low-level radio transmission service which sends it to everywhere with very high transmission power, higher than things such as WiFi or mobile Internet is allowed. Basically a whole of the frequency spectrum would be reserved just for digital money. Just like DCF77 was created to send the time via long wave.
And this is exactly what they are doing and they are doing it **now**, not in some utopian dream future.

[Please excuse my lengthy advertisement for Freenet. I do this because I consider it a waste of time if programmers re-invent the wheel continuously, especially because open source software is something which can be extended by anyone.]
I2P still is a centralized system because it is used for anonymous access to an endpoint, i.e. the I2P addresses are addresses of a single machine - which is still a single server, i.e. a centralized service. If such a machine is taken down, the content on it is gone.
Freenet distributes storage among *all* nodes in the network. Freenet addresses are addresses of content, not of machines. Just like Bitcoin addresses reference an account, not a machine.
You can take down any machine in the Freenet network, it won't magically take down content because content is stored on multiple machines automatically.
So I don't think I2P is to be compared with Freenet or MaidSAFE. MaidSAFE also seems to take the distribution approach.
With regards to Tahoe-LAFS, I don't know for sure whether it solves the centralization problem. It still seems like an instance of Tahoe-LAFS has a central owner who needs to manage it and add nodes, it won't distribute content automatically. Right?
And besides: Freenet projects decentralized websites, email, forums, chat, downloads, social networking, version control, blogging. Can Tahoe-LAFS or MaidSAFE do that yet? :)
Also, you claim that it provides better traffic anonymization and flexibility. Where is the source for those claims?
Flexibility is a very subjective claim. From a programmers point of view, you can stick ANYTHING on top of Freenet, the "instruction set" which it provides is complete enough to put any existing internet services onto it. Of course you might consider it more difficult to program than other networks.
Better anonymity is a non-subjective / something which should be proven by maths.

The password as the simplest form of conventional authentication was only used as an example.
In practice, you would use  public-/private-key crypto:
- Store the public key at the central instance. 
- Authenticate by signing an authentication code with the private key
- The public-key can be used by the central instance to validate the authentication. But by design it cannot be used to create one, so it doesn't matter whether it is hacked.
This is already in use and has been for several decades probably. The cryptography behind it is known since 1973.

The site isn't receiving enough love anyway - it has one great advantage: The fiat currency is transferred directly between buyer and seller, only the Bitcoins flow through the site.

I still don't understand why a blockchain is needed for this. A blockchain solves the problem of "what happened first", it provides a guaranteed sorting by time.
What do they need this for?
The blockchain has the very very high cost of storing *EVERYTHING* *EVERYWHERE* on the network, and thus should only be used if a guaranteed sorting by time is needed. You wouldn't want your door lock to have 25 GB of storage!
To me it seems like another case of "the blockchain my favorite new toy, lets use it for EVERYTHING, no matter whether it is the right tool for this problem".
