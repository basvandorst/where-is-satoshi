Bingo. That's my guess of what's going to happen. I could be wrong, and I hope I am. Everyone is celebrating futures, but they can have just as negative an effect as positive. But I also think they will only be able to pull that stunt once. There's a lot of people that would buy into a dip. I just hope we aren't battling trade bots and when that dip happens, we can get in at a good price in time before it goes back up.

The thing is there isn't shit we can do about it. It's cash settled, which is bullshit. The issue is theyll manipulate the BTC market to match their futures. I really hope they all short bitcoin and get their asses handed to them though.

Their verification service is either down or being hit really hard. Had 2 friends that cant get verified. I'm curious if coinbase is hitting the upper limits of how much btc they can sell and have turned off verifications to stave off masses of people signing up.

Bitcoin is undervalued. It has certain major characteristics that are each worth 100k. Here's an example: bitcoin is the first currency that can't be taken from you. If you do it right, it's literally unseizable. Do more research into bitcoin and you'll find the others.

That's a small bounty for something that would crash the btc price by 60% or more. Auditing tether should be super simple since it's 1 to 1 with the dollar. Which country is Tether incorporated in? The idea behind it is nice to stay out of taxable events, but they need to be audited. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:30:46
It won't matter any more than the dollar being used by terrorists. Institutional money has been jumping into the game, so it's getting safer than it was. And futures are coming. I don't know many terrorist currencies that have futures.

Underrated comment. Doing this will help you keep your emotions out of the game. Even if you're guess is off, it's better than trading on emotions. My target to buy in to the dip was 7000 to 7500. That never hit so I didn't buy. No regrets. Maybe I'll get the next one.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:27:58
I remember the first dip where I learned that lesson. BTC is so volatile that the extra fees will sometimes pay for themselves.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:02:14
5 million but there's only 16 million in circulation? Math sounds off.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:46:14
Tether is a token that's pegged to the dollar. Theoretically Tether should have as much tethers issues as they have money in the bank. But they won't prove they have the money. And their last bank closed their account. It would mean the current price of Bitcoin has increased somewhat because of fake money. The fallout could be huge.

And will the B2X software be ready in time for the split? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:17:49
I don't like the idea either. But has anything been released for the B2X client? Will it even be ready by the fork? Will we be able to send B2X right after the fork? The real upside is being able to offload your tokens right after the fork on coinbase/gdax. And if you think B2X is gonna tank, it's best to offload those as soon as possible. I'm still weighing it out in my head.
Edit: it also kind of seems like coinbase will use selling of B2X as a way to gauge what the people think about it.

Research as much as possible how bitcoin and it's ecosystem works. Maybe read the Satoshi whitepaper. Try to understand how it all works, even at a high level. If you don't give a shit, just buy and hodl. But there may be a time where what you know can stop your coins from getting stolen.

Bitcoin is actually the most level playing field any of us are ever gonna get. All of the source code to everything that is happening is open source. Try setting the both of you up with wallets on your phones and send a dollar or two back and forth.

Right you are Ken! I'd like to add that the right time to go with a bigger block size will probably be after the average computer's hard drive size increases. The blockchain is already 150 gigs. We shouldn't increase the block size until 150 gigs is peanuts to the average person.

You can remove the software as long as you retain your keys. In a year, if you want to sell, you send the BTC to whatever exchange you're using. Make sure you test all of this out with only a few bucks at first. The peace of mind will be worth it.

Bitcoin being anonymous is a misnomer. Every transaction can be seen out in the open on the blockchain. Sure, a wallet doesn't identify a person, but you can bet governments are trying. And kyc requirements at exchanges are helping them.

You can realize your gains in one of two ways: cash out(until you do this, your gains aren't gains.), buy stuff with your profit. Your financial strategy is realizing the most gains. Maybe my strategy is buying free stuff with the gains. Simply put, I'd rather have my cash sitting around as BTC than fiat so I have the potential upside.

You'll use your keys in mycelium if you ever want to move your bitcoin. Install a newer version that lets you adjust fees. Keep a copy of the mycelium installer somewhere. And a text file with steps if it'll help. Send a few bucks back and forth between 2 addresses you created to try it out. I understand the confusion. At the core of bitcoin, there aren't accounts like you're used to with online services. Just public private key pairs. If you don't control your keys, you don't control your bitcoin.

Well segwit was implemented, so you're wrong on that part. Building software is hard. Really fucking hard. And when you're working on something that contains a large amount of money, slow and steady is the way to go. Think of bitcoin as an alpha right now. Think of it as the system that banks use to move money between themselves. That's where bitcoin is right now. To go head to head with the likes of visa will take a second layer on top of bitcoin. Look up lightning network to see what's coming.

1. Segwit transactions are cheaper. It's totally up to you to switch to segwit addresses. I tend to hang back a little on new features in software to let everyone else test them out. It's up to you.
2. There's no replay protection on this new chain. It will have the same addresses as bitcoin.

That's not how any of this works. Core can't be forced to support 2x. Bitcoin is an open source project. People are contributing their own time to work on the project. For free. Core isn't a company. It's a team of open source developers. They can't be forced to do anything.

Bitcoin as a technology is still relatively young. To become the de facto medium of exchange, it has a long way to go. Not being hugely popular overnight is actually a blessing in disguise for bitcoin. Bitcoin simply can't handle the numbers of something like Visa right now. The groundwork has been laid. Look to the future for what you're looking for. The scaling will come in time.

And you're free to run that software. When you're running a precompiled program without understanding the underlying code, you're placing your trust in the people supplying you with the binary. You're trading that "free" for running an .exe that you have no idea what it does. To understand what is actually happening and verifying you're running the correct code takes time and effort. The response was to point the reader in the right direction so they can do their own research.
The beauty behind all of this is the transparency. Trust, but verify. I could write a script and give it to you, but if you run it without knowing what it's doing, maybe now I'm in possession of all of your bitcoin. You can blindly do what people tell you to do, but that's the wrong attitude in this environment. What I'm getting at is to have that reassurance takes your time and that is never free.

My great grandparents grew up during the great depression. We used to hear stories of how no one trusted the banks and people stored cash in their houses. As time went on and older relatives died, we found cash everywhere. Freezer, behind walls, inside tvs, etc. I was raised with a healthy skepticism of banks. If an equivalent of Bitcoin existed when my ancestors were hoarding cash, I'm sure they would have used it. For once, we have a currency where it can't be taken from you. My Bitcoin is safer than my grandparents' cash ever was.

Copied from a post I made a few days ago:
I've been trying to be a bitcoin evangelist and explain it to people that don't know what bitcoin is without coming off as crazy. This is watered down, but this is how I explain it:
When you store money at your bank, it's just a number in a database. What happens if something gets messed up or they set that number to 0? You're screwed out of your money.
Now imagine that that database at the bank is shared with everyone and everyone has a copy. No single bug or malicious person can set your balance to 0 since you have a copy of the database and all corresponding transactions.
That's really all bitcoin is. Take the technology that makes the financial system work, and distribute it amongst the people. This is really watered down, but the people I've explained it to have, at least, understood.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:48:49
