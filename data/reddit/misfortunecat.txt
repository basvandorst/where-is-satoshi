I agree this looks suspicious, but these are 0-fee transactions that have no bearing on current fees. On the contrary when the spam stopped december 19 fees and mempool size even increased.

It doesn't. If someone told you so, they are misinformed. It only increases centralization of non-mining-nodes. To what extend this is a problem is disputed, hence we have other crypto currencies with bigger block sizes than BTC.

I don't like this analogy too much. The more layers you have in the OSI model the more bloated the first layer gets. That is not how Lightning will work, Lightning is supposed to relieve on-chain throughput.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:23:02
The problem with a maximum fee is, if the mempool is full and you have a super urgent transaction you can't rely on it getting processed no matter what fee you offer. 
I don't think that we really need several thousand *non*-mining nodes (I'm aware that others think different about this), so I'd suggest to increase the blocks size.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:10:21


What makes you think that? Userbase is growing not shrinking. Even if Lightning will work, on-chain transactions will get more expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:49:16


That doesn't really make sense. [You]( just said there is only one developer.

This can also be not the reason, there should be no next time, scaling is supposed to get solved off-chain. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:14:16
Let's call it Legacy Bitcoin and 2x Bitcoin. Both chains will claim the BTC code and to be called just Bitcoin. In the end I suppose not the miners but exchanges and companies like Bitpay will decide which chain will be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-27 10:18:53
If Lightning will work and users will embrace it, we have to discuss it. But right now reducing the block size would make Bitcion useless as a currency. Fees wouldn't just double they would multiply. Altcoins would gain a lot market share. BCH would rise and take more mining capacity which would make it even worse.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:10:07

You are refering to BCH which is an altcoin. So miners will insist on 2x and to actually answer OP's question, yes we can expect some drama in november.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:05:05


That just can't be the reason. You don't risk a coin split and maybe even losing the bitcoin brand just because you think a certain feature is unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:53:15
So just like any other currency...
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:48:59
I don't get it, what are they supposed to do to make 2x a success?
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:54:34
If 2x will be a success I think BCH will loose miners who support it as a backup solution in case 2x fails. And even if BCH survives, mempool congestion might be less of a problem because of the bigger block size. Legacy bitcoin might change the proof of work algorithm to become independent from miners.
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:14:13
Wait until october when the price dips due to the 2x fork.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:03:20
In order to get those higher fees they have to mine full blocks though which will lower the fees again. So this strategy won't work. I think if this is on purpose it's to put pressure on everyone to stick to the NYA.
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:50:19

Sure, but which price will skyrocket, legacy or 2x Bitoin?
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:27:58


That's not how it works. Fees are not hardcoded in the software. There is a fee market, fees are determined by users (and therefore also depend on the bitcoin dollar price).

It depends which app you use. What you call an app is in fact an exchange. Use google to find out which exchanges you can trust and which you can't. Long-term you can't trust any exchange at all, but you are fine because you use electrum for long-term storage.
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:50:50


Your concerns are justified and this risk also applies to any other wallet by the way, so there is no 100% safe way. Still, the code of bitaddress.org has been reviewed and up to now I have not heard from anyone that bitcoins have been stolen from these addresses. Hardware wallets can get broken, so I prefer paper wallets. I admit that I check from time to time if my bitcoins are still there though.

Bigger blocks mean more transaction so more fees. Also miners are investors too and want Bitcoin to thrive.

So this is different discussion from what we just had, but be my guest. Let's discuss a more realistic example. Have you heard about the upcoming BCH hardfork to adjust the difficulty algorithm? Suppose a small minority doesn't agree with it and even won't update their nodes, would it be still fair to call the forked coin BCH? I would say yes, but I can understand if you think different. You will probably also say that the 2x fork is different and I agree. But in this case it's very possible that only one chain survives and this will be called Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:20:34


Risking a contentious fork is reckless, not smart or even conservative. If they really would agree to an increased blocksize they could just give in. A fork with 3 months preparation is nothing compared to the risks of a contentious hardfork.

BCH and LTC supply is also limited. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:43:56


That also applys to BCH. But that doesn't even matter. My point actually is: If a crypto currency is limited than it is as good for store of value as any other limited crypto. So Bitcoin has no advantage here. 
Note to the mods: I'm not advocating altcoins here, quite the contrary, I think Bitcoin can and should be more than just a store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:06:16
Maybe it increases centralisation of non-mining nodes. But Blocksize has no effect on mining centralization. If you can afford infrastucture and hardware to mine you can also handle big blocks.

How will a 2X-supporter know it will play out like this? Noone knows. They might as well end on the right side of history.


That would make 2x an altcoin, the point is to increase the block size of Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:43:58
Yes. [Russia]( just announced that they will ban cryptocurrencys (except their own CryptoRuble). That doesn't mean they can keep people from using Bitcoin, but it will make it very hard to exchange it to fiat.
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:13:54
What are your predictions based on?
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:53:08
What price do you want for them?
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:14:08
Funny that you complain about the community but at the same time you call Bitcoin Cash bcash.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:11:47
No way. Scaling will be solved by sidechains. This conflict lasts for more than 2 years. Miners would never have initiated Segwit2x in the first place if Core develeopers would have agreed to increase the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:11:45


Not as long the user base is growing.
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:20:52
Is there anyone who actually disagrees? As in Bitcoin doesn't need users?
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:58:55
Nope. I'm talking about Segwit2x here. It would become an altcoin like Bitcoin Cash if it would add replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:50:03
The article says though that these stats are flawed and we shouldn't assume.
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:27:26
You kind of avoided the question, like a politician...
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:52:57


Blockstream is not like Mozilla at all. Like u/bitcreation said, they received venture capital and they will need to provide a return on investment.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:27:25
Bcash is considered a 	derogatory term.
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:41:54
Actually only 41% of the participants of the poll agree with Segwit2x. It's still interesting, seems many more than on r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:06:59


How can we have true decentralization if we have only one development team that controls the rules?
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:16:14
Learn. Realize that both sides accuse each other of promoting centralization and being 'evil'.
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:26:14
Only if you consider miners to be a homogenous group. They could reach a consensus to increase onchain scaling, but they probably won't on other issues (like introducing inflation to BTC for instance). The argument that core developers are not one entity and have different point of views also apply to miners.
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:23:23
If exchanges will call the legacy chain Bitcoin it will keep most of it's value and it might be worth waiting.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:54:12
Yes, actually that is exactly what it means. Sure, 2x support can very well dissolves in november, but we better wait until then before we make fun of them.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:21:12
Is there a source for this?
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:57:33
I wouldn't trust anyone. Everyone seems to be biased and have an agenda.
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:44:39
He's a big blocker, but IMO he tries at least to remain unbiased.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:21:42
[Link]( for the lazy.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:36:10


That's not how it works. Not at all. Energy cost is affected by hash rate and blocks per hour rate. So small block won't change the problem, while bigger blocks will decrease energy cost per transaction.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:17:51
If you expect BTC price to rise at least 30% a year and have 100 Bitcoin, you can spend Bitcoin to pay your bills without losing to much of your capital. There are ways to loan Bitcoin and get interest, but I think it's not worth the risk.
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:50:42
OK, there defintitelny are advantages of running your own node, but we already have about 9000, how can it even more decentralized?
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:30:05
Hey, thanks foy you reply, this was actually a rhetorical question though.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:51:35


This article implys that Kraken and Localbitcoins also say no to SegWit2x. That's not true though. Both have yet to take a stance.
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:17:55
They don't need to. Some people thinkt that after the fork the sum of both values will be higher than current Bitcoin price. If you believe this it does make sense to buy Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:29:12
If the legacy chain survives or even prevails over 2x there is indeed no reason to think that, and I don't think anyone really does.
@_date: 2017-10-20 10:02:29
Yes, we see different realities.
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:57:13
But you get their point, don't you? What if 20% of the money goes to BCH? This is not unlikely, a lot of people hope 2x to become the new Bitcoin and will switch to BCH if 1x wins.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:09:37


How can it be under attack then? And please don't tell me the community is attacked, there a lot of users (outside of r/bitcoin at least) who want 2x.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:21:27


I thought you ['hate']( it.
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:33:37


This is only true for central banks.
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:31:40
91% of all blocks mined in the last 24 hours signaled support for Segwit2x [(Source)]( That percentage has dropped to the low 80ies in the last days.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:11:03
When I bought I planned to hodl for a couple of years, so I'll hold no matter it'll be at 50 or 50,000$.
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:37:39
Probably November.
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:47:31
No. I'm sure when they will, they will post it on their [blog](
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:31:18


Not the same as what LocalBitcoins actually said, which is


'You should not expect' means there is no guarantee, it's not a statement against Segwit2x.
Also we don't know which chain will be considered Bitcoin by LocalBitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:24:55
Sure, not everyone has heard about of Bitcoin but everybody knows what a wire transfer is. The joke would work even better with credit cards, because unlike bitcoin you can actually pay in most shops/restaurants with your credit card.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:01:16


But will they? I think OP is right and exchanges will stop trading and wait until a clear winner is established.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:35:50
Fair enough, just acknowledge that we take a risk here. Besides, who the bad actors are, is disputed even within the community.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:45:54
Even if you hodl you'll buy breakfast and clothes no matter what, you might as well do it with Bitcoin instead of fiat money. You can still hold for investment purposes at the same time.
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:31:09
As far as I understand they actually *removed* the opt-in replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:25:03


OK, you can say the cons outweigh the pros, but you can't seriously say 2x has no advantages, like a simple scaling solution that will increase the number of transactions and decrease the fees at the same time.
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:53:02
Change BTC Core to Satoshi Nakamoto and it might make sense.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:46:15


Stock prices alone rise even if you factor inflation in. And you get dividends on top. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:05:32


What could hostile (non-mining) nodes do though?
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:38:40


I suppose so, but since noone knows for sure I'll still hodl.
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:07:14
Yeah, sorry for you too.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:52:25
These nodes doesn't mean anything because we can't know if they are real. Someone could set up 300 systems with 20 virtual machines each and fake all these 6000 core nodes.
You are right, I would never agree to changing the 21M hard limit or the block reward, but my non mining node has no say in this.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:35:40


There is also no consensus among users to stick to the 1x chain though.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:52:58
These are not all Core nodes (not that I think it does make any difference).
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:50:15
This is a conspiracy theory in the same way as people saying core developers are completely controlled by blockstream.
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:02:10


You called it an attack though.
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:28:33
This looks actually pretty much like a bank.
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:59:28
Stocks and Bonds return dividends and interests. It makes more sense to compare Bitcoin with gold.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:37:22
Can we call it Ministry of Truth?
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:16:02
Yeah these are mostly non-mining nodes though. NYA signaling is over 90% of hash rate. That doesn't mean that there is huge majority of the community in favor of 2x but in certainly means that node count is a bad metric to measure community suppport.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:43:01
I didn't say r/bitcoin *is* neutral, I said it comes off as neutral due to the name (to newbs at least).
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:58:50


What else are you supposed to do with an "electronic cash system"?
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:22:28
Sure, but governments can control exchanges, so they can make it very hard to exchange your BTC into fiat money. That's why it's so important that Bitcoin stays a cash system and will not become just a store of value.
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:29:06


Why though? Why shouldn't I have the right to be concerned about Bitcoin's technology as a holder? Whatever way Bitcoin will go in november it will effect it's price and my investment.
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:17:18
I'm actually rooting for the fork but if the lightning network will indeed work it's ok for me.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:40:36
I didn't say there is a majority that doesn't want to stick with 1x, I was talking about consensus. Also the futures represent what market participants expect to happen, not what they want to happen.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:18:44
It looks like you haven't heard about the NYA.
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:57:52
It's a hostile takeover from Core. The real question is should Core own   Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:46:15


It kinda is actually. This is a power struggle between a couple of individuals and not so much about technical issues. Each party has tried to get the community on their side via social media which has led to this toxic atmosphere.
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:08:30


As the user base is growing this definetly will become a problem or already is, depending on who you ask. Solutions are moving transactions to a second layer (like the lighning network) or increasing the block size (which the upcoming fork will try to do).
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:47:41
Blocks will still be mined, miners will get payed by transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:14:15
Yes I do. More traffic means more users which will make BTC price rise.
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:47:54
If 2X is 30% than legacy bitcoin will be 70%. This is what the futures are actually traded right now at Bitfinex. So no free money.
@_date: 2017-10-06 09:56:53


He has a point, but then again gold ETF are a thing. Easier and more secure investing.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:47:03
Why do you think people keep gold as store of value? The government can't take it away from you, they can't even devalue it through inflation (by increasing money supply). The same applies for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:54:52
It's a big increase indeed, but is it worth to risk a coin split about it?
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:29:52
Clickbait.  
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:36:12
How is it an attempt to split the community? The community has already been split for a long time. Wasn't the segwit part of s2x actually an attempt to *unify* the community?
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:07:44
If they are not neutral, are they pro 1x or pro 2x?
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:30:19
I wrote this earlier in a similar thread


@_date: 2017-10-06 12:04:11
Whatever chain wins, it es pretty unlikely that there will be a dip after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:26:14
Shouldn't you wait until november with that meme? We are currently at 95% signaling NYA.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:40:20


There is nothing to understand. This is politics. Bitcoin startet as a "peer-to-peer electronic cash system" and it hasn't stopped to be that.
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:25:53


How does reducing block size help decentralization? POW difficulty won't change, so it won't make mining easier. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:14:21
Because full nodes will prevent 2x from collapsing, or what? This guy calls himself a troll by the way.
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:11:30
It might turn out like this in the end, but do you really think not a single exchange will list 2x-coin straight after the fork in november? What makes you think that?
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:11:03
So your point is, only core is allowed to change Bitcoin without replay protection, is that right?
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:41:32
Let me rephrase, they control the bitcoin protocol. Or are you alluding to that the 2x camp already has won and is in control now?
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:37:28


I think what OP is trying to say is, even if a hard fork might be risky it's way less dangerous than the situation we are facing in November with to chains without replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:50:57
Yeah, I understood that. Bitcoin's proof-of-work diffculty already automatically adjusts to mining-costs.
@_date: 2017-10-05 08:44:03
This is about politics not technical issues. Also we don't even know how much resistance there is against 2x. Don't let yourself be fooled by a loud minority who resorts to name calling.
@_date: 2017-10-05 07:46:06
Depends on which chain you call BTC. Also why do you call them 'shitcoins' if they are pretty much the same except have better scaling?
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:00:22
It doesn't, but it's not the right thing to do for a sub that comes off as neutral in this matter.
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:18:45


That doesn't necessarily mean these transactions can be related to people. For instance I may or may not own Bitcoin, but noone can say if I do and how many BTC I own.
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:01:06
Right now it's 92,4%.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:19:39
Mempool ist not cleared though.
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:02:31
Single core developers are a subset of Core. Not the same.


Are they in the position to do so in the first place (aka being in control of Bitcoin)?
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:36:26


In that scenario I expect the 2x-chain to die. Big blockers will focus on BCH then.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:17:05
Maybe a minority of core developers agree to a bigger blocksize, but it won't happen. It just doesn't make sense to risk a contentious hard fork without cause.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:02:27


I'm a hodler and not a miner and I want more traffic.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:28:19
What's wrong with seeking profit? If I wouldn't expect Bitcoin price to rise I'd rather put my money into dividend-paying stocks.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:41:30
That's not how it works. A big part of the community also strongly disagrees with cores 'codes'.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:51:09
How would that work? What happens if the debtor goes bankrupt? Is this viable smart contracts? I honestly don't know.
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:23:42
BCH is an altcoin. The goal of the NYA is to increase the block size of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:23:11
OK, but it should work the other way round. More users mean more traffic. Anyway I hope you get my point, from a hodlers point of view more traffic is a good thing.
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:47:20
Core would need to come up with their own hardfork with adjusted proof-of-work difficulty. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:41:45


Not true. Hardware of mining nodes (unlike some non-mining nodes) is advanced enough that they are not affected by a block size increase.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:58:11
We are talking about exchanges here not users.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:38:57


No new proof of work is necessary, Bitcoin has already difficulty adjustment. A peer-to-peer exchange would be great, but I think if that's even possible it would be a second layer solution and doesn't need to be built-in into a crypto currency.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:02:09


What does that even mean? Segwit2x is open source.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:58:19


But we are not safe. Not compromising means we will have two chains without replay protection. Don't you think that this is way more dangerous than bigger blocks?
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:18:58
I didn't get it. How is that theft?
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:44:17
I assume that existing mining pools already consist of 99% Bitcoin hodlers, so I don't think that would make a difference.
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:21:16


Yes you did. I was refering to this


Anyway, Core have done a lot of updates to Bitcoin. Don't get me wrong this is a good thing, but they could only do it because they were in control. Someone hast to be.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:37:02
That was 2010. Are you saying the software isn't advanced enough today to handle more users and the reason to fight against scaling is therefore to keep the userbase artificially small? 
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:31:01


What does that even mean? Cryptocurrency can't be democratic. Are you aware that currently some individuals wage a war over the Bitcoin brand? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:41:40
I agree it's actually two loud minorities who stifle a reasonable discussion.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:18:12
What decentralized exchanges trade Bitcoin? How does that work? I genuinely don't know.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:57:19
This would be funny in a universe where Bitcoin was the first digital money/currency.
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:25:53


I wonder what Buffet's position on fiat money is.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:33:01
We still will need banks to finance stuff though. Also if interest rates will get up I might want to loan banks my bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:28:59
I don't know if that will be helpful. You won't understand Bitcoin by looking at a computer.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:00:28
You are also a fool if you think you know what's going to happen.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:06:29


You also don't see wide community agreement for keeping the blocksize so small. So what now?
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:03:23


How can both chains survive if neither of them have replay protection?
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:37:41


Yes there is. Otherwise core developers would have made a suggestion how to introduce it. But I agree that it is a power struggle in the end.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:36:31
How does that work? Was that an on-chain or an intra-coinbase transaction?
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:05:56
Sure, but what's the point, is there a possible attack on Bitcoin that could be prevented with more non-mining nodes?
@_date: 2017-10-11 07:25:26


Miners could agree on the block size, but that doesn't mean they are an entity or cartel that can steal your money. So how is this the same with fiat and how is this worse than the current system where a small group of core developers make the rules?
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:41:16
True, but I think the majority of Bitcoin market participants are hodlers not traders.
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:12:00
*Low-value* not low-fee. People switched to other crypto currencies.
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:07:13


It's also your first post on reddit.
