I was signed up and haven't received anything. Anywhere I could read more about this? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 21:57:32
Initial amount already returned? I haven't see n anything about this. I only had 0.92 btc there but would still be nice to get my money.

Me neither, doge is of course number one and where most of my money is invested. I have some in btc too though.

I have gotten money from mtgox a few times, got 1000 euro out this month and I am waiting for another 1000 euro.
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:21:26
Haha i bet you have lots of important stuff to do :D

You do realize that the doctors today were not alive and had nothing to do with what happened in the 1920s?
By the way great sources and such in that video, it must be legit! I mean how can something not be when the narrator does the evil voice when talking about doctors and so on?
Something tells me you like the zeitgeist movies and other conspiracy theories too?
And i somehow get the feeling that you do not have an higher education and think that just because others put a lot of time and money on education does not make them more deserving of money than you, am i correct?

I have been interested in cryptocurrencies quite a long time and can see a lot of potential in dogecoin and the community. I have actually traded all my BTC for Ðoge but will later hold both. I see more potential in Ðoge than Litecoin actually.

And you think that it's the doctors that make the big money from this?
I would think it's the medical companies that has the money and chooses what to lobby and support.
I feel sorry for the us for having such a retarded system and government though :/

This is so great! I've actually spoken to them both in their stores and via email about starting to accept bitcoin and I also made a topic about it in Swedens biggest computer forum, great to see them implement it!

Yeah fuck doctors who only does good for people and save peoples lives and sometimes gets sued by these people that they saved. Why can't they work for free, or at least put all their free time to lobbying for the retarded us government system? Who cares that they spent millions to go to med school and probably has lots of debt?
Out of curiosity, what is your profession?

The 0.025 i did send, the 0.02129482 i did not send.
So the 0.02129482 must have been sent to a change adress that i own then?

If you think they are so bad why do you want people to get help from them? You think they would do a better job for free?
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:44:57
Thank you that explains everything!

600 days..

I remember the price spikes when mtgox stopped their payouts :) after that when the trust in exchanges was lost bitcoin lost 80% of its value, fun times! :) 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:41:26
I remember when it was a big thing that new company's like overstock accepted bitcoin and everyone used it and bought more btc. Now everyone is just saying hodl it's a store of value blabla because all the good things like fast free transactions is no longer true.

I know where the wallet.dat was, but I can only see the disk in some recovery programs and have not been able to see any files or anything. My best hope is the USB drive, there I will have a wallet, hopefully the right one but not at all sure about it.
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:57:55
Thanks I'll give it a try, it's hardware failure though so we'll see how it goes.
@_date: 2016-10-19 12:35:24
What is the actual private key, my password for the wallet? Because my hard drive crashed before and my backup was actually not the correct wallet so I know my bitcoin adress and I know my password, is there any way to solve this? 
@_date: 2016-10-19 14:35:35
Hmm so do I have any options other than somehow trying to save a very dead disk or being extremly lucky and actually having the correct backup wallet on a USB drive that I haven't been able to locate for a while?

Swede here, prepaid cards are sold over the counter everywhere and there are no laws against it. Totally anonymous. Also no problems getting a phone without registering it. Source: I work in a phone store..
