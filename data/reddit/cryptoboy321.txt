Yes that is why the guy who made the top comment also thinks so even I think so I will not stop here like all the rest who got hacked I will trace those btc using bitcoin who is who get the IP and track him down I will also message all exchanges to check if they have done any kyc aml I will send proofs that those are my btc that is what block chain is for right "transparency" also I will message all withdrawal methods and otc I and high volume exchanges to ensure my BTC gets locked if they are on an exchange and the funniest thing is my BTC could well be on a nother ledger Nano s itself right now I even sent the txid to ledger will somehow do something never gonna give up till I find the person who did it

How can they acsess ledger wallet without the device can you please provide more info I like to learn about this feature I thought ledger hardware device's memory phrase should be entered in the device or a new device itself to be recovered how else can the memory phrase be used without a hardware wallet to access the funds ? Thanks

Just check i am not alone search btc widrawn from ledger or bitcoin stolen ledger search that on google see how many people have lost their btc and wtf is the leger 4 digit pin there for if any one can set a new pin through a memory phrase so even if he had my 24 word phrase without my 4 digit pin on my ledger he could have not hackd it ledger should have thought of these before making such flawed devices
