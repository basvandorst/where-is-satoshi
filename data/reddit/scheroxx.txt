Besser informieren :) 51% Attacke ist seid BSV bei BCH theoretisch nicht mehr möglich, da bestimmte Barrieren implementiert wurden.

Tell me how Bitcoin solve problems? Look at stellar for example. They solves problems in the banking industry.  And this is that what the people and economy needs. 
 People use btc for trading and making profit. That's all. In 2009 the system from btc was good. Now it's old and lame. It's the mother of coins and this is the only reason why BTC holds the number 1 in the market. 
I bet in 3 years, BTC will be not the number 1. Keep than in your mind.

Interesting view �� Bitcoin is too overvalued. If you invest in 2010 than okay. But now you can not make big profit with BTC. There are many other coins that are undervalued.

2018 was the preparation. 2019 is the launch year.
Every new market has to develop first. and that takes time.

Thanks for the answer.

All the alts are service provider that solves problems for the economy.

Best video for the motivation ��
@_date: 2018-11-19 10:18:41
Exactly 
@_date: 2018-11-15 22:53:36
Hodl guys! Time will come. Tier 1 guys make it possible �� 
Don't forget, q1 2019 fidelity will launch a new platform

Not a impact but for me it is a sign that guys with big money believe in BTC and the crypto market. 
Weak people's sell and whales buy more. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:59:12
Awesome ������

All the people who invested from early days are real crypto investors. Now big institutions want new investors like the stock markets and fresh money. 
And this is that what is coming in the next time.
No billionaire would be buy 100 million on coinbase. This guys need it simpler like the stock market. 
No stock market investors buy BTC and trade it on exchanges in Hong Kong or bahamamamas or wherever. They need trusting brokers. 
And this is that what bakkt and fidelity and Goldman Sachs want to reach.

Don't understand your view with the meaning of worthless. 
The system from btc is old. Very long transaction time and high fees. Not anonyme and so on. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:59:04
Tell me why? :)
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:42:21
Take a look at verge or tron. I bought verge and tron in December 2017 and sell it in January 2018 with 800% and 1100% profit. 
It's hard to get this profit with Bitcoin. This is that what I mean. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:59:26
I need more and good arguments :)
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:51:35
Interesting view ;)
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:57:01
Bitcoin cash. The next update is really awesome 
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:43:22
I only buy more with fiat to accumulate. No trade. Have not so much time to trade. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 08:51:46
Not something something. 
- Bakkt in December 
- Goldman Sachs if Bakkt is launched 
- Fidelity q1 2019 
Is that something something for you? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 10:55:39
Click on the adresses and you can see that's not exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:06:43
Absolutely. 6 is now my max supply of coins. Now I accumulate it and don't buy new currencies.

24. January 2019
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:40:48
Why big companies like bakkt, fidelity and Goldman Sachs will enter into the crypto market? ��
Because it's BTC is dead? ����
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:51:26
Why not 10 million ��
I think we would be happy if BTC reach the ATH again
