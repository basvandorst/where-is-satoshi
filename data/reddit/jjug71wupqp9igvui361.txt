And make sure to encrypt your wallet.  I say this, dearly hoping that you are not keeping your BTC on one of the exchanges.  ...because that is just f'ing crazy.

Some facts are indisputable.  BTC volatility is extremely high compared to any fiat.  With a range of $11 to $266 in the first half of this year.  Any REAL WORLD business would not be able to finance operations with that sort of cash volatility when their COSTS are in fiat.

At the very least, prepare your exit strategy.  EG, Setup an account on CampBX, and link your Dwolla to it, verify the account, etc... it can take weeks end-to-end.
Remember, when the shit hits the fan, all the exchanges are going to crumble under the stress of a mass exodus from Gox.  For those that have been operating in the red, they will go bankrupt one by one...

liquidity is the wrong word if you can't remove your liquid cash.
@_date: 2013-08-20 15:39:11
The other exchanges are not immune - they have just been too small to have any scrutiny paid to them.
...but bottom line, if Gox goes down, the price of BTC will plummet.  Moreover, the mass exodus from all the exchanges will likely cause an industry wide bank-run.

The other important point about Buffet is that his investment options are very different from the rest of ours.
@_date: 2013-08-20 15:55:35
The danger isn't only to Gox.  If Gox goes under, then a huge number of people are going to cash out on ALL exchanges.  This bank run can drive the rest under like dominos as people, in a panic, frantically search for any way to get their cash out of the BTC system.

Yes!  An infected computer could just wait for you to login, and then send your money away.  It is not onerous for you to type it in on any withdrawal.  I have it on login as well as withdrawal (not on order placing).
@_date: 2013-07-19 01:15:09
I don't see that on clarkmoody.  Where do you see that?
@_date: 2013-08-20 15:02:40
actually, they are literally locking the exits to slow the mass exodus.
@_date: 2013-08-20 15:42:00
Pardon, but we have no information on their monthly expenses.  They have been scaling up considerably, with more employees, more server, more rental space, more DDoS protection services, etc...  Since they are not public, they don't release any of this information and we have no idea how much they are in the red or black each month.
@_date: 2013-08-22 14:00:08
It shouldn't matter.  For every business, there should be 1000x the number of customers.  Moreover, a company with serious finances would actually keep as few BTC as possible at any given time in order to insulate against currency fluctuation as their costs are almost certainly in fiat.
What we are seeing here is something much more nefarious.  It is hording by miners and a general lack of small-time buyers (since Gox had Dwolla cutoff).
In my opinion, this news means the BTC economy is shrinking.  IMO, there are a lot of factors here...
- As mentioned, Gox has fewer fiat input/output conduits.
- Revelations that TOR exit nodes have been run by the gov't, hence reducing trust in Silk Road.
- General lack of growth in retailers accepting BTC.
- General lack of continued mainstream consumer and media interest.
@_date: 2013-08-20 15:43:18
I think the BTC withdrawal issues are very suspicious.  How do we know one of their employees didn't steal mass amounts of BTC.  We've never been given any information on their internal controls.
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:12:07
They don't have people's money!  They are making *maybe* 5K per day in revenue, but are easily spending 20K.  They've already spent all your money.
@_date: 2013-08-20 15:40:03
...and be wary.  The rats will pile onto the other nearby ships (BTCe, BitStamp, etc...) and sink them as well.   A bank run never only hits one bank.
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:04:11
What a load of crap.  I work for a bank and all our interbank transfers are automated.  We can do 100 per day, or 10,000 per day - it makes no difference.
If you no longer have people's money, you should be honest with them.  There's no point in digging yourself into a deeper hole.  At some point negligence becomes fraud.
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:06:44
...and they are going to suffer just like the unregulated banks of the past.  They'll collapse from panic withdrawals (where fears become reality).

The only free lunch is diversification (first rule of investing).   This guy is needlessly risking his life savings.
@_date: 2013-08-20 15:32:56
They are already dead - they just haven't told anyone yet.  Think about what must be happening in their office...  water cooler gossip that the company might be insolvent, that they won't get paid next month, productivity drops as people work on their LinkedIn contacts, then BAM! the linux SA exports 10 million worth of BTC to an external account and quits.  Mr Magical Tuxedo, is too scared to tell anyone so he slows withdrawals, hoping that he can miraculously save the business and repopulate the money... and of course exporting a little BTC for himself as insurance.
...which brings us to today.  What will Gox do next?  Which creditor will shutoff their service first?  Landlord?  Bank?  DDoS protection?  or will the employees just stop showing up to work when their salary stops?
@_date: 2013-08-14 14:31:55
Even if it did, what the Indian government says and what the Indian government does are wholly unrelated anyway.
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:20:27
No no no... you misunderstand.  They are actually bankrupt and don't want to admit it.  Any bank can process automated transfers - I work for a bank and we do it all the time.   These clowns are legit bankrupt.  They stopped withdrawals so they can pay their bills while deposits are "delayed" because they don't want to credit the customers account so they can hold onto that money longer - buying even more time for themselves...   It's a downward spiral that ends in scandal, fraud charges, and a Bitcoin price crash like we've never seen...
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:13:51
...and hurry up about it because the inter-exchange spread is widening...
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:16:31
I think the trading pattern makes it obvious.  Who would see 25K coins in one shot if they couldn't get the cash out quickly?  The big whales obviously have no problem taking their money out...
...assuming half the transactions on MtGox are even real.

Concentrate does not mean 100% investment like this guy did with BTC.  That's just stupid.
Also, yes, wikipedia, because mailing you my port theory book would be a real pita.

That's a bit of a contradiction, isn't it?  If you poll the people who got lucky, obviously they will tell you to risk it all like they did.

As for Buffet, he's one of the most diversified people on the planet.

Is this a joke?  Diversification is literally the only way to reduce risk for the same reward.  This is the foundation of all portfolio theory and is mathematically proven.

hahah... you idiot.  What do you think will happen when Gox dies?  BTC price will plummet and everyone on every other exchange will also try to cash out.  Every exchange is going to choke under the load - none will survive.

No.  It smells pretty fishy.

Except that is not the consensus at all.  The BTC economy is stagnating at the moment, and none of the exchanges are safe from regulation, theft, or liquidity crunches.

I think you need to factor in additional salaries and costs for servers, replication, ddos protection, etc...  I think they are BSing when they say their costs are "roughly the same".  No way that's true...   Unless he's pulling the old "we don't consider capital costs as operational costs" - in which case, it's entirely possible they are insolvent.
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:03:17

nothing.  They pay a fixed return, so if you find a company with solid revenues, they are very secure.
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:15:03
Of course it's legal.  This isn't a regulated bank.  The amount of regulation a bank needs to go through is huge - specifically to prevent the kind of shenanigans we see at MtGox.
@_date: 2013-08-20 15:44:08
Incorrect, the money belonged to Gox.  People who's transfers were in the middle at the time (at least outbound) had their accounts credited.
