This! For all the people just getting started, don't forget about traditional investing (stocks, etc.), and do your homework on altcoins! Don't put all your eggs in one basket, as they say.

Bought at $4900 ATH. Not just surviving but thriving. Because I bought a shitload again yesterday when it was $3800.

Thanks for the PSA! But where did Coinbase state that there is specifically a 72-hour delay?
