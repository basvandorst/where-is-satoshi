Copay is probably quite safe wallet, it has been around for years. Also paying with bitpay is safe, I have been using bitpay for years and haven't had much problems. People don't like bitpay because they are pushing bch, not implementing segwit, demanding KYC etc. It is not a scam company, just pushes crypto to different direction than people here want, so that's why people are boycotting it.

Well, as long as fees are communicated in clear enough way I don't see much problem with it.
In my opinion, a scam company is a company in crypto space that takes something like all your money (and that kind of thing has happened). Bitpay maybe charges high fees or whatever, that is not in my definition scam. You are free not to use it, you can call it expensive or lousy service or whatever but scam is a different thing.
I haven't had problems with bitpay, though I haven't used them for a while. The fees have been maybe high but I haven't been paying that much attention, anyway I don't think that they have been that outrageous since I would have noticed that. In 2017 where that blog post was, generally bitcoin fees were pain in the arse everywhere. There are lots of alternatives nowadays and the merchants I have used in last year or so seem to use newer payment processors.

Well, to me experience it is not about some merchant accepting btc using bitpay or some other payment processors, more like it is about whether merchant accepts bitcoin at all. Bitpay was the first mover in the space. I'm still happy to pay with btc with high fees than not being able to pay at all.
