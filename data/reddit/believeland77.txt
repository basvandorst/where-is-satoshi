You are awesome!! Thank you sooo much for the clarification!

Pics or it didnt happen ��

"Mint officials — who at the time had no clue the gold was actually gone — were later so convinced of Lawrence’s smuggling method that they had another security employee duplicate the technique."
That's the real hero of the story.
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:30:31
Spot on.
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:21:00
How much do you have invested?
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:15:00
Works good for me too.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:01:43
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:34:08
With all due respect, you don't want another post about the ETF, so you make one then discuss it?
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:37:42
Cake is nice but that "O" face lady in the back is even nicer.
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:23:50
At 10k, I see cocaine and a hooker
At 50k, cocaine and 2 hookers
Oh well you get the picture..,
@_date: 2017-01-05 06:03:51
I hope 18888 is even luckier then.
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:35:12
HAHAHAHA!! Ok.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:02:24
Oh I dunno, I missed your story then.
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:42:20
Solidtrustnews.com sounds just as reliable as breibart.com ��
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:31:36
Yup, so I have more time to buy.
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:41:37
Just take out 25k and put a down payment down. No need to buy the whole thing all at once.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:55:14
Crypto steel? Maybe...?
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:36:31
Solid. I like it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:20:43
Any one that goes up is just fine by me :)

How many xboxes do you play at once?
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:29:57
Could go belly up tomorrow. Higher the risk, the higher the reward. You take that money and put it in apple too...you make less but have a lower risk of losing it all.
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:59:15
Yes, my mistake ��
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:17:04
In three years, we'll see someone possibly eat their dick on TV too.

Enough to wake up each day and laugh when I open my Blockfolio app.

Honey badger doesn't give a shit.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:54:15
Risky as hell, probably not the best idea. 
But scared money doesn't make money either. 
Do half of it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:12:28
NEO 
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:35:23
lol, I'll throw you an up vote now.
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:19:09
Hey Siri "flip a coin"
@_date: 2016-12-07 05:08:30
And I found them to be the cheapest too. That sucks!
@_date: 2016-12-24 19:34:07
If it's for cocaine and hookers, yes. If not, just sit tight and hold long term.
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:32:38
I do it all the time. If you're unsure just transfer a very small amount. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:34:33
That's the line going into the Vatican, not a bank. Seems shady already, not gonna waste my time on this one.
@_date: 2016-12-12 23:15:01
I bought the ledger nano s. But, I'm not an expert on these either but everything I read always had good reviews on both. So I choose the cheaper one.
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:00:47
I dunno, I feel like mine would be much more basic. Nano ledger s and crypto steel together with a note "watch YouTube videos on both. You're welcome".
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:58:45
Why would we not want to pay taxes on it? I enjoy roads, bridges, the police force, and the fire dept. It's a serious question, I'm new here but just don't understand that side of it.
@_date: 2016-12-17 21:47:02
My prediction: $1603.49
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:13:49
Fees will be much lower with segwit. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:54:38
If he doesn’t know where to store 34 BTC, he shouldn’t be selling his property in BTC then. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:16:07
Yes, or wait until 2020 and see what you have then ��
@_date: 2019-04-28 18:08:12
Lol, wild watermelon. No chocolate.
@_date: 2019-04-10 13:39:17
Yo! Just to let you know as someone who is going through a divorce now, she’ll be entitled to half your gains while married...PRENUP! Not to say your making an unwise decision, but love can be blinding and splitting assets later can suck. I’m proof.
@_date: 2019-04-29 11:13:35
You’ve, clearly, never had kids.
@_date: 2019-04-28 22:15:02
The other side is a monkey, I bet the logo was supposed to be yellow.
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:01:24
Gotcha, that explains it. Don’t knock something unless you try it.  That is why your comparing pedophilia to marijuana is so abused. To sheltered people it could seem the same when in reality, it’s not close. Only a very close minded person would group those together like you have. 
Just because you haven’t done something doesn’t make you the moral police. You sound like Jeff Sessions, puke.
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:02:03
Whoa, you must live in a bubble if your best argument is to bring up pedophilia. I win this internet battle for sure. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:05:28
It’s reasonable in due time. It just on the top end.
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:05:52
Wut? Legalization will cause problems? Which problems is Colorado experiencing beside huge tax windfalls? 
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:28:24
Nice try IRS.
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:39:18
I’d be ok with it settling right around 950k.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:30:12
Focus on time in the market, not timing the market...and you'll most likely be fine.
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:56:51
Ummm, get a job?
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:08:36
Been there twice, what a fucking beautiful place.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:48:20
Using my nano ledger S...need the address?
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:10:04
I understand your point but grouping those two together is a little irresponsible. Do you drink?
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:47:16
What do you mean by you pay 1000 to set it up?
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:52:56
What if he sold them to his dad for what he originally paid for them?
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:24:30
Think about it like cars...if you had one Rolls Royce and the number of cars you had doubled.   The first car was now a Mercedes second one was a Ford. You would have two cars but they wouldn't be worth the same.
I may have butchered this, but this is my understanding.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:22:38
I'm no where near that point, but if you can now...I'm not hatin! Congrats!
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:52:23
@_date: 2017-06-27 23:50:14
Stop with these bullshit post!
@_date: 2019-05-28 13:34:11
Hopefully the cat doesn’t knock this rally off the table.
