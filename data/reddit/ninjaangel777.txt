Confirmed untrue

That has nothing to do with what I said? I said it was weird that people get charged because I don't

This is ridiculous. I understand this is your choice, but you are over reacting from one event. Personally, I would be happy if I got it because that means that are cautious with my coins rather than accidentally letting my stuff get stolen or break the blockchain

Why do they need to detect root though?
I'm not being critical, I am seriously clueless here

Can anyone direct me to videos or a written lesson of just what Bitcoin is, how it works and things of that nature? The wiki doesn't help and I can't find good ones

Why does it request root?

Is there anything that allows me to use NFC to pay fiat currency from my Bitcoin wallet? Like have my money in Bitcoin, but go to any pay pass terminal and be able to spend them?

I'm not lacking smarts, just motivation for useless numbers. College means something, high school doesn't

Its what I've been told. Sorry. Deleting my post

I don't have checking account usage fees so I thought it was weird to charge people for using an account
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:58:36
I'll give them both a shot. It doesn't hurt to make sure you know everything about what would technically be a very volitile investment.

I missed the game.
