Why would I get banned? It was just my best guess as to why they banned me because that is literally all I did. Bought BTC, deposited to Exodus wallet and bought alts.

Calm down man. You shouldn't have invested because it's obvious that you invested for the wrong reason. You have no faith in the whole idea behind Bitcoin. If you understood what Bitcoin is and future potential you wouldn't be saying things like "I want to throw up" or "is there a way to cancel the transaction" Research what Bitcoin is, hold on to your coins, and don't worry.

Yeah, I got mine yesterday. I was just about to post pics of it because I hadn't seen any on here yet. 
I don't get the "ease" part either, or the pink handcuffs. Are they pink Handcuffs?

Coinbase is actually pretty badass. Sorry there are so many haters.

Did you ever withdraw and buy alts? I did and got a ban with no explanation. I tried reaching out to them, but they just cut me off completely.
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:40:26
What would be hilarious is if it never happened.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:19:31
Be careful OP. Square will ban you for buying alts. I did nothing wrong and got banned for taking my BTC from Square Cash App and depositing it to Exodus and buying alts. They won't give you an explanation for the ban either.

It's kind of like folks get some kind of pleasure in trying to being others' hopes down. I constantly have people sending me articles full of FUD.
