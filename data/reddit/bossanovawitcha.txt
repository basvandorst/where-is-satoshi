Big mistake.  Alts are going to ride bitcoin for months.  It's inevitable.  alts must take over for crypto to be legitimate.  Bitcoin will always be king, just not the only.  Market cap flippening is just the start.

I think it is.  Bitcoin is being beaten into submission and it comes out stronger.  I think it will survive this but it is going to be tamed and turned into the store of value king while the alts revolt and take the MC lead again.  It has to happen for the crypto world to flourish.

There will never be “the next bitcoin.”  
But you CAN find “the next...” space winner or creator.  They are out there.
For me - its Power Ledger, OMG, Civic, Substratum.  Mostly because they are tangible solutions I understand best and see massive applied need and love their teams and markets.
There are others but they are harder to quantify, at least for me.  Some projects like Syscoin could be massive, but they need adoption and they have focused on product.
I don’t own any NEO but it has massive potential.  IOTA could be the biggest network in the world someday, but it might get beaten up by more specialized supply or IOT coins.  I’d buy some tho.
OH - and if you missed out on the Dash masternode (most of us did)..  check out zCoin ASAP.  It may become the second best masternode in 2018. 
Happy Hunting!

I personally think it will come back down to 5200-5600 again after the fork..   but that may be because I want it to and because it so easily found support there..   there is a chance this shit is parabolic and all you may see are corrections and not crashes for awhile. :/

1) nothing goes up forever 
2) thinking is that alts may be seen for the much better value they represent once everyone has BTG in their hands
3) some investors will immediately take profits, price perhaps drops to 5400-5800
4) ethereum value to bitcoin is around May 2017 levels - doesn't take a genius to see that should change soon
5) this could all change if a lot of new investor money sees 5400 as a worthy entry point and all jump in, but I expect that smart money will wait until November fork resolved

FUN - top bet to capture decentralize gaming during allow dev on their network, 300 sats !?!  actual working demo, strong leadership, also fits rule of "is the problem best solved with blockchain" - trust in gaming is essential!  it's a slammer.
OMG - M2M in Asia might be the start of Holy Grail of crypto use and again  strong leadership and relationships 
NEO - it's over qtum losing ICO's to NEO should continue thanks to China gov nobody really paying attention but it's over NeO is the oNe and will be right there near ETH NeO GAS I still think it's crazy not to buy this up regardless of how NeO prices services in GaS , HODL it!
Civic - this is one of the next huge players in the space and nobody knows it coz it sounds boring..  it's so sexy can't do anything without idm or security in crypto space..  their ecosystem should have huge demand.  should already be 2.50-3.00 and nobody would blink that knows anything about the project and leadership - in 2018 it will hit those numbers or more.
Metal - feels like one of the stronger plays in the fiat - electronic money - crypto conversion servicing and probably best potential for adoption vs tenX or Monaco but I would buy all three as this space is undervalued and could be the first to really bear fruit as spending crypto adoption grows
WTC - I don't own any yet but want to
SYS - whomever wins the decentralized market space is gonna be quite valuable and SYS has the best product, feels like a rebrand could turn this into a beast..  based in BC, so less attention perhaps than they deserve - did I mention they have a maturing product in this world most have nothing but hype..
