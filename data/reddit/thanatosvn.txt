To be released on January 29th, 2016 in Vietnam. Producer: BHD Media Corp. (
Suboi let us know about her new movie, ‘Bitcoin Heist’ when we spoke to her a while back and since then we’ve been dying to learn more about this action comedy. The full film won’t be out until Tet, but we’ve got a first sneak peak at the teaser for the new film starring Suboi (the hacker), Petey Majik (the trickster), Thanh My (the cat burglar), Nhung Kate, Mai The Hiep (the forger), Thanh Pham and directed by Ham Tran.    
‘Bitcoin Heist’ puts a team of skilled criminals and a special agent on the hunt for one of Interpol’s most wanted criminals. Who better to catch a criminal mastermind than a criminal mastermind, after all? There’s no way this plan could backfire...is there?
The teaser introduces all the game’s major players, in what looks kinda like a cartoonier ‘Mission Impossible’ or ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ even. Best parts of the trailer include a slick Petey Majik trick, as well as some cool looking action sequences and a high speed boat battle.

The step 1 and 2 are switched in VN case. Looks like this:
1) Go to the "BUY" tab, click on USD--&gt;BTC, enter the amount you want to buy and click "buy"
2) Start a transfer from your bank, it takes &lt; 5 seconds to complete.
3) Done! BTC is transferred to your own wallet.

Government decisions taken in the framework of virtual money
Government and relevant ministries are rushing to carry out the project "Improving the legal framework to manage and deal with all kinds of virtual property, electronic money, virtual money," the source said of Bloomberg. 
Risk of money laundering, tax evasion, foreign currency bleeding
draft proposal said, recently, business investment virtual currency, electronic money is increasingly common in many countries and become the new trend on the market financial market in the world, with 670 types worldwide, such as Bitcoin. 
The use of virtual currency offers many facilities such as cost savings, convenient transaction, fast, hard to be counterfeit ... should attract more people to invest in business. However, the virtual currency transactions can give rise to many types of crime such as money laundering, tax evasion and smuggling. 
Under the scheme, in Vietnam, investment activities, trading virtual currency tends to increase, complicated, scale, scope extends from the big cities spread to the northern border province , Central, Highlands ... 
in particular, the multi-level virtual currency trading is a broad audience to invest. However, the incomplete understanding of virtual money that the participants take great risks when working on this game. 
Legal, Vietnam is a lack of legislation to regulate the virtual currency, electronic money, leading to the management difficulties caused by these transactions are mainly carried out through the Internet, causing losses to the budget, or a tool for tax evasion, money laundering, bribery and weapons sales. 
In particular, the Government's proposal also raises the risk of bleeding in foreign currency, destabilize financial markets currencies. 
Around the world, countries like the US, France, Germany, Britain, Japan, Canada ... have built the legal framework and policies to manage business operations, using virtual money. In particular, focus on four issues is to build management framework, policies enacted taxes on investment, trading virtual currency, a policy to protect the interests of holders of virtual money, prohibited transactions virtual currency translation issued by the private sector. 
Multiple vulnerabilities in management
Before this reality, the government said that should take measures to manage the virtual currency transactions in order to avoid consequences arise. 
About virtual assets, with current law provisions of Vietnam, virtual assets may exist including both tangible and intangible. Virtual property and tangible emerging technology developments such as online game account, the objects in the game ... 
In the broadest sense, are understood as virtual property resources on computer networks is determined by the value and can transfer money in civil transactions. Currently the value of virtual property can be up to hundreds of billions of dollars amid exploding technology today. 
Existing legal framework for the kind of virtual property as Anti-Money Laundering Act 2012, Circular 24 of the Ministry of Information and Communications, Decree No. 72 ... is not yet clear. While the world has defined management of virtual property types such as e-mail, websites, chatrooms, URL ... 
About electronic money, currently has 103.5 million Vietnam bank cards and 2.2 million electronic wallet. Electronic payments play an increasingly important role in the economy. 
However, some types of similar electronic money as a store of value is being used as a prepaid telephone cards (in addition to calling features can also be used to purchase goods and services online, card online games ...) not held by the bank or payment service is licensed by the State Bank issued but no management framework. 
"Vietnam law has provisions on electronic money but full sour, there is still no uniform led to confusion between electronic money and virtual currency. So research is needed to clarify understanding and unified management policy for each audience, "the text stated. 
On the other hand the regulation of electronic money is mainly prescribed in the circular of the State Bank now need to upgrade to a government decree. 
Virtual money, the scheme said the State Bank Law of 2010, the Credit Institutions Act, 2010, the Foreign Exchange Ordinance 2005 was amended in 2013 no prohibitions on transactions using cash shirt. 
Under the provisions of the Electronic Transactions Act 2005, Information Technology Act 2006, Decree 52 of the Government, the virtual currency is not in the list of goods and services prohibited business in the form of e-commerce from. 
However, the Government says is necessary to clarify the legal status of virtual currency, determined management model, virtual money as means of payment or goods or property? Thus minimizing the risk of virtual money system with the currency market. 
Bringing virtual money into the framework
according to the Ministry of Justice, although Bitcoin or other virtual currency is not Vietnam and many countries recognized, but the value of the global market capitalization is Bitcoin own $ 10 billion, accompanied by there are civil disputes, commercial, crime ... should not be beyond the management and supervision. 
According to the Government, the objective of the project is to build the full review, a comprehensive legal framework for virtual property, electronic money and virtual currency in Vietnam. Clearly define the position and responsibilities, the role of State management agencies, chaired construction, finishing to minimize legal risks the financial system from virtual currency, virtual property, electronic money. 
The Government assigned the Ministry of Justice in collaboration with the State Bank, Ministry of Information and Communications, the Ministry of Industry and Trade and other ministries to review the status of law, the practice of virtual currency, virtual property, electronic money 12/2017 previous month. 
Study up 3 decrees on virtual property, electronic money, virtual currency in 2018. Government Simultaneously, measures proposed tax collection, criminal sanctions for violations related to these transactions . 
Notably, the proposal also emphasizes learning management experience in the US, EU, Japan. In addition to bringing virtual currency, virtual property, electronic money into the legal framework of decrees, the government emphasized the amendments and supplements to the laws governing arise in the new context. 
"So far there is no uniform behavior, clear to the management of virtual currency world-wide, depending on the management objective of each country to make policies and measures manage. However, countries were very cautious with virtual money, "the report stated. 
Accordingly, there are 5 ways to manage virtual money is alert, regulations for agencies to protect virtual currency consumers, notes added on the basis of existing laws, regulations holistic, forbid. 
Under the current design, virtual currency risk lies a difference compared to other means of payment, and other storage, which is the exchange rate between virtual currency and other cash continuous change. Also small transactions made by cash liquidity is quite limited, a large transaction can change the value of the currency.

Uber India had to implemented a wallet service for Uber as required by Indian law. I'm pretty sure they can just simply turn on the "Bitcoin wallet" feature and it would work the same way.
Normally, Uber rides are geographically limited. They can determine the minimum required balance for each city. This feature actually bring a lot of benefit for Uber since credit card payment fee for small trips are huge and the fradulent risk would be reduced since Uber can ensure that the payment due will be paid.

FPT University suddenly accepted to pay tuition fees in virtual currency bitcoin
While the regulator has not yet provided a specific legal framework for administering bitcoin virtual currency, FPT University suddenly announced that students would pay tuition fees in the form of virtual currency.
President of FPT University Le Truong Tung said that FPT University accepts students to pay tuition fees by bitcoin. In the short term, the school applies bitcoin tuition fees to foreign students, and encourages internal students.
Concerned about receiving bitcoin fees, FPT University will have to convert foreign currency to cover operating expenses. While bitcoin ups and downs erratically, and leads to the possibility that FPT University will miss the tuition fee when the bitcoin price drops, FPT University President Le Truong Tung said that at present, foreign students still pay tuition fees. fees in foreign currency. 
So in terms of exchange rate risk, it can be seen that foreign currency and bitcoin are the same. 
On the other, according to TS Tung, Vietnam has no regulations related to bitcoin. 
While there are doubts about virtual currency, bitcoin prices continue to rise, reaching a new record of $ 6,063 per bitcoin. Last month, China banned virtual money-raising transactions, which forced major bitcoins to close. But it is strange that large-scale bitcoin mining operations with computer systems are still active in the country.
