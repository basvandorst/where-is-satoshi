My 401K was all in stocks. Stocks in companies is also gambling. I just feel like i have better return on Bitcoin over the next 10 years. I may cash out before then if the gains are meeting my expectations.

Invested it all into Bitcoin back in Feb when BTC hit $7K. I anticipate BTC hitting $40K this year and $250K by 2020.

I'm not selling until 2020 despite how low it goes.

I could lose it in my 401K as well. It's all stocks which are not guaranteed either. They could all go to zero just like crypto but I've done my homework and I believe Bitcoin will only gain value over the next decade.

My 401K was all in stocks. How are they not a gamble? Any of those companies could go bankrupt and I could lose everything. At least now I have full control over my investment and if my research serves me well, I will come out on top.

I'm no longer with the company. I invested in BTC in Feb when it was at $7K.

I'm not selling before my target date, no matter how low BTC goes.

Because Bitcoin is the grandfather of crypto, it will have a place in crypto for many years to come. That factor, combined with the fact that the crypto industry is in its infancy says that unless something terrible happens to bitcoin, such as a hack, it will likely grow many times in value over the coming years.

I'm confused. If you put in a sizable amount of money into Bitcoin back in 2013 when it was around $100 each and Bitcoin has gained 2000% since then, how was that stupid?

Here's where we're at. On Feb 5th, a little over 1 week ago, Bitcoin dipped all the way down to $6K, I went all in and invested $12K into 2 Bitcoins. Today Bitcoin is at $10K making my $12K investment worth $20K. Yes, it all could crash next week and I could be left with at a loss but I have a very strong inclination that over the next couple years, Bitcoin is going to 5-10X in value.
