I also have a project to design a bitcoin keychan: 
It is a small LCD screen keychan that stores and shows only user's unused public addresses and has a single button. 
Use instructions:
1) On PC software, through USB cable, load all your unused public addresses on the chain
2) Each time you show a public address to someone, you press the button (to mark this address as "used"). Since it is not connected to the blockchain to check if shown address received a transaction, user have to press the button to load the next unused address.
3) Keychan LCD screen start displaying the next unused address.
Would you be interested?

Are you going to release translations?

Crowd translating with bitcoin would be much cheaper than current translation services. Each sentence could hold a bitcoin address. Payer could pre-select which translators he wants to be able to translate his work.

Sure. This is a great idea. The only difficult part is the security behind it.

It would definitely finish if the required amount of payment on each round was increased a little bit.

Well you violated bitcoin's  rule: never put money you cannot afford to lose.

How will people prove that they are living in the disaster area?

There is clearly a pattern, and it is repeating itself periodically.

I would also include in the box a book with scientific hints about halitosis, toothbrush and toothpaste.
