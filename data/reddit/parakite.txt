Definitely. If US govt bans exchanges, citing national/financial security reasons, then bitcoin can be trading in $100 range. or for similar reasons.

at one point, it seems to have jumped from 2 satoshis to more than a 100 satoshis almost overnight. Thats 50x gain. But the liquidity was obviously very low.
There were many such coins.
Even I followed and bought a coin called gulden, which was being run by a company which was creating wallets and "read world use". At one time it entered top-20 even. But then it fell. 
The thing is gulden and reddcoin may still prove better than many coins which are today doing very well. who knows!

At this point, Bitcoin has recently faced scrutiny from senate/president/treasury and its still holding at 9800 right now. 
Its been spoken in same breath as Libra (which is character defamation for Bitcoin), but still not been harmed much.

Overall, this is bullish. Everybody seems to know Bitcoin has to cross its previous ATH, but we're just dithering over when to do that.

I don't follow the team, technology etc, so can't say much about it.
Apparently its an oracle service, which feeds real world data for eth contracts.
Giving oracle powers to the "wisdom of the crowds" is a bad idea from get go, imo. If oracle were to ask a crowd in 2004 who won elections, during gore/bush florida voting fiasco, you'd get weird results. 
I think only reputible people/brands can serve as oracles(even for temperature, I'd trust weather channel rather than some inefficient method to poll a crowd), so in the l long run I doubt it will have anything other than niche use.

two key differences: t
1. there can absolutely be no insider trading in bitcoin. what this means for price action, one can analyze. one result is that an insider can keep buying/selling cause they something more. so there can't be drastic changes. with bitcoin, if any new information comes, it can't come from insiders, cause there **are no insiders**. so price rise or fall is very fast.
2. bitcoin being child of internet is susceptible to price action due to social networks on the internet, which are much faster. so it will also result in large movements in shorter times (compared to stocks).

Plus if someone has bitcoin, and they're "unbanked", and as such have no direct access to a useful exchange, then they'd have to sell bitcoin for the buyer's rate.
even if coinbase has a rate of $10500, that rate won't apply in antarctica or in the amazon. 
if you aren't even in a "market", then don't complain when you get non-market rates.

The amount of tax evasion in India is huge.
I know personally so many people who bought bitcoin just to evade taxes.
And its easy to evade taxes in India already. 
Putting a free for all crypto into the mix where people can park their cash is going to really not go well here or in any third world country that wants to progress.
If USA had bitcoin in 1880, then the country would not have become the superpower it became, because bitcoin automatically weakens the government by allowing people more control over their finances.
But in India, and in other poor "corrupt" countries, people need stronger and less corrupt governments.
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:36:21
The bitcoin blockchain, and the UTXO's contained in it, follows agreed upon rules. That's the Bitcoin protocol. 
Its "possible" for the stakeholders to come to almost any agreement, and then change the protocol. In the realm of theoretical possibilities, its possible that everyone agrees that those coins will be "distributed" among all the current holders.
But that is never going to happen, because no one will agree to it. That kind of change is theoretically possible, but practically never going to happen. 
What is more likely, is that 50-100 years down the line such old coins are locked forever, as some kind of security measure, if needed.

**Lets take Eth**
Around 15 March 2017, one Eth had crossed bitcoin price of 0.025 btc.
After that, it had always been above that price.
Except today(and last few days), when it is again back to 0.025 btc.
So if ever you bought eth in last 2 years and four months, you have only lost out to bitcoin. And in the short term, eth is still falling.
**Lets take Ripple**
The earliest price of xrp on coinmarketcap is 5 Aug, 2013, when it was 5590 satoshi.It fell a bit, then again rose to highs of 7000s satoshi each in January 2015.
From Oct 2015, to march 2017, xrp was in the low 1000s. Only the people who bought it then would have made any profits with it. Today its at 3406 satoshi, which is about half of what it was exactly one year ago. People who bought xrp 5-6 years ago, many of them would have lost to bitcoin.
There you have it.

all good points. also I want to add, that the reason bitcoin is unchallenged is that no other coin has been started for the **pure** purpose of just starting a coin. 
Every single coin I know of has been started by people who just want to make money. 
the third coin xrp is an out and out scam for fuck's sake. 
I'd even say that no serious attempt has even been made to create a challenger to bitcoin.

Somebody was asking about how hard it was to buy bitcoins years ago. without kyc etc, I think it was simpler, or so I'd guess. Anyway, I wrote [this in reply](
I had to travel 20 km to go to the nearest exchange. On foot.
But I did it because I had heard a lot about it, on them interwebs.
The exchange was basically a room with a girl sitting there. She accepted cash, and I gave her my bitcoin address.
After she had made a few calls to the a miner or more, she got to one who expected to get lucky any block now. He hadnt had a block in an hour. So the girl kept call waiting, and put my name for some 50 coins of that block.
It took about 30 minutes, for the miner to call back. He won a new block, and he sent those 50 coin reward to my address. I let him keep 0.5 bitcoin as a tip.
Overall, it took me a whole day to get those 50 bitcoins.
Later I lost them in a hurricane during the last year of Obama presidency.

I think it would be safe to say that a significant number or majority of owners of bitcoin would move their bitcoins at least once in 1-2 years, just to do some wallet management.

@_date: 2019-07-31 19:04:58
For regular folks (everybody except miners) there is no direct effect.

I think there is a very simple explanation for this.
60% of the bitcoin haven't moved in a year. 
The holders of these coins, aren't traders.
they are going to come once to twice or so on a exchange, **in their lifetime**, to just sell their coins.
They are, on average, sitting on 2x to 50x and **more** gains.
They don't care about 1-2% difference,that much. And they don't care about slowly selling their stash.

I find it more interesting to do my own research.   
By looking at GBTC page on [archive.org]( we can see that in last three weeks, the declared bitcoins owned by GBTC has increased by about 14,000.  
That's a huge number, when you consider that every week only 12,600 bitcoins or so are being mined.  
So more than a third of new supply of bitcoins is being taken off the table by just one ETF, which is GBTC.  
Imagine if we had more such mutual funds/ETF's like that, \*\*or\*\* if the interest kept growing like that.

Companies don't want to spend on infrastructure, or engineers who can implement the new changes.   
Knowing how weak much of software in the industry is, in any industry, I am not surprised they don't want to change software and spend more. Lot of software cannot take a lot of changes, because you just want to not touch the one which is working.   
So a lot of big companies continue to choose to pay a bit more, rather than change/improve their infrastructure.

Price could move either way at any time, because it depends on "popularity" of bitcoin as investment. 
but if you ignore that aspect, and if we assume popularity does not increase , nor decrease. then bitcoin price will still grow against dollar, because dollar loses its value every year due to inflation.

on being asked if a crypto currency could threaten dollar's dominance, and the advantage that USA derives from that dominance, he's saying that no-one uses even bitcoin as a payment system, that people use it as a speculative store of value. 
then he says that, in future it could change, if any currency or currencies do start dominating, that would bring USA back to that "national bank" system, where there were many different currencies (and not just the dollar).
I think this is almost scripted. he knows what they'll ask, and they know what he'll answer. even though they'd never have communicated directly. Because the Washington works on consensus, and all these (and I'm not being racist here) waspish old men know what others are thinking too.

However, there are plans to have low orbit satellites, which will have recievers too, and companies are planning a sort of wifi network all around the globe using a chain of such satellites.

I had to travel 20 km to go to the nearest exchange. On foot. 
But I did it because I had heard a lot about it, on them interwebs. 
The exchange was basically a room with a girl sitting there. She accepted cash, and I gave her my bitcoin address. 
After she had made a few calls to the a miner or more, she got to one who expected to get lucky any block now. He hadnt had a block in an hour. So the girl kept call waiting, and put my name for some 50 coins of that block. 
It took about 30 minutes, for the miner to call back. He won a new block, and he sent those 50 coin reward to my address. I let him keep 0.5 bitcoin as a tip. 
Overall, it took me a whole day to get those 50 bitcoins. 
Later I lost them in a hurricane during the last year of Obama presidency.

how? btc is up 4x from two years ago.
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:22:21
Today eth is at around 300. So from 10, it has jumped 30x.  
Bitcoin I dunno what it was then, but overall it has jumped 18x at least.   
Overall, I see not much difference between 30x and 18x, in degree.   
Obviously, when you talk about the intermediate highs that have been seen by eth (1200), then the difference can be stark, specially when compared with the lowest eth has been. But in the long run, btc hasn't been a bad bet overall.  
Plus bitgold has only fallen from its initial pump/forking. And there seems no hope that it will rise. Same goes for bcash, which has been struggling with even finding developers who will work on it.   
Personally, I am pretty much totally committed to btc at the present. All other 'coins' are definitely trying to solve problems, and many of them will succeed, but none will solve the problem of 'store of value' problem that is perfectly solved by btc due to its security. Overall, I am kinda in same basket as you, in that I also remember when eth was sub-10, but I don't take it as a opportunity loss, because of having still seen up to 18x gains.

I got 20 reasons. or so. 
which angle you wanna hear? that western union ceo says point blank that ripple doesn't reduce cost? (in other words is a scam). 
that xrp is being dumped by ripple labs but no institution is buying it?
that ripple labs literally pays $50 million usd to money gram just so they say they may use ripple's product? (only a scammer will pay to use its "product")
I got lots more. what are you looking for?
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:53:05
The Western Union ceo, who was in "partnership" with xrp, said on stage a few days ago that:
**using ripple technology/product does not reduce costs in transmitting money**
Thats when ribble story ended. 
Now this truth has only to be repeated, and more widely known. 
and since the ceo of the worlds largest money transmitter has said it, other ceo's of other companies will say it too. Then everyone will clearly know what's truth. 
xrp will be very close to zero within 9 months. Just check its recent price trend. it has fallen 5% just in last ten hours. 
its a coin which no one is going to buy. once people start dumping it, it can go to zero in weeks/days.

# Lets take Eth
Around 15 March 2017, one Eth had crossed bitcoin price of 0.025 btc.
After that, it had always been above that price.
Except today(and last few days), when it is again back to 0.025 btc.
So if ever you bought eth in last 2 years and four months, you have only lost out to bitcoin. And in the short term, eth is still falling.
# Lets take Ripple
The earliest price of xrp on coinmarketcap is 5 Aug, 2013, when it was 5590 satoshi.It fell a bit, then again rose to highs of 7000s satoshi each in January 2015.
From Oct 2015, to march 2017, xrp was in the low 1000s. Only the people who bought it then would have made any profits with it. Today its at 3406 satoshi, which is about half of what it was exactly one year ago. People who bought xrp 5-6 years ago, many of them would have lost to bitcoin.

there were many coins that did go from zero to some non-zero amount, and gave huge gains to some people. 
But the exact same coins fell later, and gave huge losses to the later ~~investors~~ bagholders.
I've not heard of reddxcoin, out I'm sure it would be likely delisted from exchanges, or again zero valued. thats a guess, without looking it up.

which means higher quality stories.

I follow some good crypto websites, and definitely think they have better quality news than r/bitcoin 9 times out of 10.

You are saying as if some shitcoin is same as ethereum. Not every alt-coin has the same value as ethereum.And there is no law of nature that there 'will be an alt-run'.
Every coin/token will have to prove its utility. There is no justifiable reason why every coin should rise in value with some other coin. A coin with hardworking 50 developers is not the same as some abandoned coin who no one is working on, just for example.

its possible if they were not a professional, and ran the miner in college, and later forgot or lost their hard disk.
2 million bitcoins from 2009-2010 haven't even been moved in last 8 years. We can safely say vast majority of them are lost due to forgotten/lost keys.
I'm sure many/most will be people who had other coins. But there will be many who lost all they had.

 I did say that the point about inequality should be fleshed out.
So that's what I think, that its a subject worth a discussion.
Bitcoin is only ten years old. It has a "founder effect" which is well understood in history and biology studies. Wherein the small original founders will influence the development a lot. 
Obviously after 1 block, all 100% of bitcoins in existence were with one guy. And that inequality has only reduced after that. 
So I'm sure the inequality in bitcoin is more than real world. 
But thats understandable, and normal, and could not possibly have been otherwise. Unless we want to give up proof of work and just hand over coins according to Proof of existence(of all world population).

Bitcoin's "transaction time", which is the time between creation of "blocks", comes from number of factors, such as network bandwidth, hash power, and probability of "wasted" blocks which could be superseded if this time were lower. 
As far as daily transactions go, anytime more than 5-15seconds is not convenient. So 10 could be reduced to 1 minute, and it will remain still unattractive to visa.
So, the design never tried to make it compete with visa in speed. 
Because, its main strengths are two, intertwined: "security" through "decentralization". 
Speed is not the main feature, but of course its created as fast as possible/desirable. 
So its not going to replace visa, but its designed as a layer on top of which other solutions can be built. 
About taxes, I think things will clear over time.

And "progressives" is always a minority. Because a vast majority of people by definition cling to the old ways. Not cause they're dumb, because thats how the world works.
Progressive ideas are always propagated by a minority first. That's the definition, almost. 


Thats just an unscientific assumption. As if people don't want to enjoy wealth in their life. And as if filial inheritence isn't the norm among humans already.


Thats an idea that can be fleshed out and backed up. 
But the way in which the US spends money on its military and the way it can destroy whole countries (such as saddam's iraq), or the way it can engage in trade wars, in order to maintain hegemony, and comparing it with lack of any such power with Bitcoin, I'm damn certain going in that Bitcoin is more egalitarian than USD or any other such asset.
Edit: there are actual slave markets in post Gaddafi Libya. Another example of american interventionism backed by USD.

No need to come to for any news. There is nothing new here.
News is given by companies that have to declare partnerships, new roadmaps, etc for their coins.
bitcoin doesn't have a ceo, nor partnerships to declare. It doesn't have a roadmap, except whats already in code and executable installed on 100000+ machines worldwide.
So, no need to actually track news. Hodl, and check the latest once every few months. Keep using it too. Check out the latest wallets once in a while.

Price is a factor of supply/demand. 
But even more, of popularity.
If btc keeps drawing buyers after becoming more and more popular, it can **possibly** get to $100k-$1000k, even more in 100 years.

In that link alone you can make a guess. That page allows you see how many coins haven't moved in 7/8 years.
The coins that haven't moved in 8 years, you can assume no one is going to move them now.
Even the coins that haven't moved in 5/6 years, vast majority of them can be assumed to be lost.In that link, exactly 3.87 million coins have NOT moved in last 5 years.
99% of those coins are lost, and don't have any owner (or they would have been moved). Its as good a guess as 95%. So thats how we estimate the 4 million number you mentioned.

Bitcoin is a coin, but its also a network of inter-connected computers running the Bitcoin Core software. These computers are called nodes. 
They are the fundamental backbone of of the Bitcoin network. Some of them are miners. Non-mining nodes and mining nodes together are the Bitcoin network. 
The individual Bitcoin exist on each one of them as part of a database/structure called the blockchain.

And 10% of all xrp were taken by, or given to, then ceo and co-founder Jed McCaleb.
And get this, he worked for the company for only one year. 
ripple got some 75%+ xrp's. I've lost tract of exact percentage, because its just an embarassingly high number. 
And Jed McCaleb is regularly dumping as much as he can every day. Millions of xrp's are being dumped by jed everyday, and bought by gullible buyers on He's the co-founder. He must know the future scope of xrp price.
He obviously understands that today is the best price for his xrp's he'll ever get.

one of the top three cryptos is a total [scam](Think of how much the whole space will improve once such scams are totally exposed and are closed.

Jed may be called shady. 
But one fact goes in his favor: xrp is a much bigger scam than stellar ever was(as far as I know of stellar). And jed quit xrp. Which leads me to give him a positive point. 
The scam of ripple/xrp is not just the premine. Its about how or what type of lies they're spreading, and how often. 
Ripple's lies are the worst, biggest lies in crypto space.
Mtgox I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt.
Know that creating an exchange in 1 years is an engineering feat. And without pioneering work like the creation of mtgox, btc would not have progressed as much as it did. 
That it later lost coins is again an engineering failure, and who is responsible for it, is different question. 
At some level, you can tell I have some amount of respect for jed. 
Because, he's an engineer. And he has a history of creating solutions.

Are you including exchange addresses here?


You're here assuming a bitcoin price of $1million. Thats pretty high.
1500 isn't that big a number. but even that doesn't apply here because you're including exchange addresses among them. 
Rough estimate, about 500-1000 of those 1500 addresses are exchange addresses.

I would request the mods to outright ban any post that mentions Craig Wright. I know majority of people consider him a joke, but a lot of people may not, and there are also many new subscribers, who may be mislead into believing that there is some possibility that this con man is Satoshi.   
Specially considering the fact that he actually promotes what might be called a competing as well as fake fork of Bitcoin Core chain, promoting or mentioning him here in posts contravenes the rule about not promoting competing chains or projects.

Lets say govt knows that isis is getting donations in a specific btc address.
What can it do? 
Isis will run that address through mixers. Couple dozen times.
In a mixer, 100s of people do their transactions, and then no one can tell who paid whom. 
Then all track of ownership is lost. But everyone gets tainted.
In the end, by doing this a couple of hundred times, even isis could get their btc without leaving a trace, but I won't bet too much on that. Its just a hunch. 
Overall, I think btc does have a fungibility problem. Addresses are well known, transactions are public, which means addresses can be tainted. 
But that's still ok, because btc's goal was what it is. 
For total primacy, there is monero (xmr).

The govt is overselling how important btc was in their operation.
That's their job, to put a spin on it.
However, your expectation that btc allows you or gives you anonymity and avoid scrutiny is a wrong expectation. 
Btc was never designed for that. It does not solve the problem of making secret transactions which no one can look into or track. Its "cash like" in that the other party always knows who handed them the cash. The problem it solves is that no "intermediary" is required. Not of anonymity. 
And imo, that's the right approach. I'm a statist, in that I think civilization from egypt onward was built around a state power. Hiding from states is attractive, I may do it sometimes , but in long run, state or governments make the world go round.

Xrp will literally go to zero once ripple is closed. Eth can be used to create cryptokitties, which although silly is a use case. Xrp has absolutely no use case, its totally a bagholders coin. 
So I keep it in its own category as a "total scamcoin".
But I agree with your larger point, and think that when all the other scams and shitcoins are shown the door, bitcoin will rise even higher.
At this stage, even bitcoin is tainted by its unwanted association in crypto space with scamcoins and shitcoins. Once the air clears, the rise of btc will be faster.

There is non-zero chance he'd be sued any any number of people, including govt. He will have to hire a team of lawyers to fight that.
He can do it, with his money. But I think he may want to avoid that hassle, specially if he's already got some other millions.

A hedge fund which wants to buy some btc presently does not have many options. As I understand, the bakkt's custody product/service is the best in the market.
So the trillion usd pension funds now actually have a way to buy and hold some btc, which they did not have before.
And the main point still is that the ceo/owner of nyse would know 100s of helge fund managers by name, and dozens personally. He **has to know** what they want, by his conversations with them. So there must be incoming demand, by that inference.

The derivation algorithm always derives the same private/public pairs in same sequence. 
Which means when using such addresses/wallets, the initial pairs are used before the later ones. That's just how its normally done.
If any wallet started using the millionth or billionth address, and you didn't know about it, you may lose it, unless you used special software/generator to derive millionth/billionth addresses and checked them on blockchain.

Whales aren't some godly beings who totally control any market. Many whales lose money, and go bankrupt too, if they do some large short or long on margin. I personally don't think anyone can manipulate the market just cause they want to. If it was so easy, then the returns made by such whales would have make it a perpetual money making machine, where they would be making more money from the profit they earn. Yes, large holders may have some advantage over regular folks, but that does not mean they totally control the market.

XRP has a lot of marketing. Its promoted by a private company, whose board of director consists of ceo of sbi holdings, which is a top financial player in Japan. Not just that, they have a warchest of a couple of billion dollars, which they have created by selling xrp to gullible buyers.   
Will you say xrp will continue to grow?   
Just checking what you have in mind here.  
The reason I keep insistint that there will be no alt-coin run is because that thing ( a previous run) happened only ONCE. You can't create a pattern based on something that happened once.   
And even when it happened, at one time xrp + eth marketcap was MORE than that of bitcoin marketcap.  
How is that rational or logical? If you think that wasn't logical, then you have to accept that there was something inherently wrong about valuatoins seen in that run.   
ergo, those type of valuations will not repeat. That's my logic, put in few words.

Finance will remain centralized, because you need support of law etc to implement contractual obligations.

Real morality lies in sitting in your underwear and becoming an internet expert. So that you don't have to go out in the real world.   
In the real world, there are real physcical attacks possible. And to stop those attacks, by anyone malicious, what will you use? A sword or gun.   
And when you can't use a sword or gun against your attackers, you ask for help from the stronger entity. Ideally, the strongest entity.

Decentralized solutions of bitcoin type, have one property: anyone can enter, use and leave them, with **equal opportunity**.

no body know till when that will continue. but right now we're in middle of a bull run, and this is not gonna stop anytime soon.
will at least touch 20k before it falls 40%.

With just 70% of your total portfolio in bitcoin, its impossible to beat bitcoins huge gains. 
Bitcoin's annualized growth is about 20-40%? 
the other 30% may be getting 7-8% of stock market at max. 
then its impossible for a mixed portfolio to beat a 100% bitcoin portfolio. 
plus: its impossible for a rebalancing portfolio, like one you suggested, to beat a "non-balancing" portfolio, because in the latter one, bitcoin will become greater than 70% and start giving higer returns for whatever portion greater than 70 it is. 
My point is this: if you think that bitcoin will keep growing, don't rebalance. 
no textbook tells you that you only rebalance for assets where you're not sure which security will actually outperform. 
When you **know** or believe strongly that one will outperform significantly, you should not rebalance.

I'm an Indian btc hodlor and I I'm not selling. 
I kinda support bitcoin ban in India. 
hear me out, why. 
The one main problem of India today is that the rich don't pay taxes, not to the extent they should be paying. 
My landlord, for example, has political connections, and goes for family vacation in europe regularly, but he taker my $120 rent in cash. 
Because he does not want "white money" trail. 
All he wants is black money, for which he won't pay any taxes. 
now with cash, he has a problem, given govt controls cash too. govt can track gold too.
But if tomorrow he is able to buy bitcoin, or accept rent for bitcoin, he will have the best tax evasion tool ever devised. 
That will leave the poor of india as poor as they are, cause the govt won't have money to improve their life. 
so I personally support making bitcoin handling as tough for tax evaders as possible.
Once tax evasion is reduced, indian govt should make it free to use again. 
for the record, only 2-3% of Indians pay personal income taxes. I doubt my landlord pays it.
@_date: 2019-06-10 11:00:43
I own 20 gazillion bitcoins. In a chain I created. ;)   
\&gt;  They can make kyc mandatory for buying/selling bitcoins. Banning it outright is wrong.   
India is a country that even banned cash. Look up demonetization. So the general rules that you are telling me do not apply in India. You are not aware of the corruption that is prevalent here. None of the logical rules you are used to are applicable in India. 
\&gt; And you owning bitcoin and supporting its ban just proves you don't really understand the philosophy of bitcoin.  
The philosophy of bitcoin is applicable for a free first world country, where monetary policy is mismanaged.   
In India, monetary policy is also mismanaged, but what's mismanged more is the rampant corruption, of which tax evasion is just one part of problem . You are trying to apply western solutions to Indian problems. That won't work.   
All I am saying here is that India is a different place. It needs its own solutions.

17.51 million bitcoins haven't moved since 1 June 2019. [seen here](
So the owners of those coins are sitting tight. 
That means *only* 567000 bitcoins have been active in the market in last six months.
And of those 567k, many would be just moved by people as wallet management or movement unrelated to selling (such as xapo's movement of 220k bitcoins, which was taken over by coinbase. But those coins were never sold, just changed custody).
Overall, all these highlight how few bitcoins are actually available to be bought and sold in the market at any time. 
Could be just in tens of thousands.

Its not about late. Its about lack of "belief" in bitcoin's success.
I have colleagues who bought in the last bitcoin uptrend in FOMO.
On average, they bought at about $12-highest (20)k per. 
and when bitcoin fell below their average buy price, they started selling.
now all three of them (in two companies) are keeping their distance from this bull run. 
because they've taken "heavy" losses. So they just don't have the appettite to touch bitcoin now.
Part of problem is people invest more than they can afford in fomo. but thats another topic, about how to actually "invest".

Your bitcoins are in the 24 word seed (more if you use extra words, which is possible to do).
If you're anyway going to not touch your btc for ten years, I won't bother with a hardware wallet. 
Do this: in a offline computer (ideally a computer that has never gone online), you should generate your wallet with a unique 24 word seed. save that seed. Note down public addresses from it.
send btc to those addresses.

80% of my net assets are in bitcoin, so I am not buying anymore. But to anyone who wants my free advise, if you don't have 10% of your net surplus \*miminum\* in bitcoin, you will miss out.   
As long as its under 15K, its a good buy. Right now it will go up till 15-30K without even a hitch. Then it may pull back and come down until 10-15K who knows. All these numbers are just something I am making up as I go. My whole point is that buy it as long as it is in 4 digits.

People who have btc, they are easily on boarded.
People who have other cash, they will need to buy btc somewhere (which is the pain point). After that they can easily use btc on ln.
Point is you don't have to use kyc to do even international or national payments in ln. This will interconnect a lot of apps, who now have to depend on payment processors (such as google play store) for payments.

Time doesn't matter, knowledge or misunderstangs do. Right now you already claim xlm and xrp are decentralized. That kind of opinion can't be held by a newcomer. He'd first learn what decentralization is.

Not clear what you want here, but if you want a separate seed phrase for one of the address that's already generated by some other seed, then it can't be done. 
A seed phrase is basically a very large random number which is represented using english words (the random number is derived from the english words).
That random seed number is used to derive private/public keys using cryptographical mathematical formulas. 
You can't then derive another seed from those private keys, because the math just does not allow it. Its only one way transformation from seed number/phrase to (multiple) private/public keys.

btc is a form of secret money, in that its like a private treasury you have, where government can't look into. 
so any government which is already struggling with black money and low taxation is going to clamp down on another way to hide your assets.
as such, almost all governments will want to reduce btc's imprint, and developing countries more so. 
as such, Indian govt. push to reduce its use (by banning banking services to companies that work with crypto) is understandable.
I don't like it, because it sets a wrong precedence.

Fair question, but there definitely are more volatile stocks, if you started to look.   
And given the overall increase from $700 to $10k that you have seen, its obvious that its not going to happen totally linearly. Some volatility is expected. And $19k/$3k is that volatility.

But if tomorrow bitcoin stopped being sold to people who don't already hold btc, even then it will continue to work and sustain.
The price, it could be argued, will not increase much, but logically it will still increase with the rate to counteract any devaluation of dollar/yuan etc.
Also, bitcoin does not promise any returns. Its a coin. You buy it, and you sell it. There is no promise attached with it. That also makes it NOT a ponzi, because central point of ponzi is the promise of return, otherwise why would anyone buy  into it.

There is no necessary reason why halvings have to result in price rise.
They could result in hash rate reduction too, with no change in price.

Since we are all stuck here with Bitcoin, I have a suggestion to make it more interesting.
How about, every week on a specified day and time, we have a weekly 'B*uying with the Bitcoin Bulls*' event. It will be a thread or an event, lasting an hour to a day, during which every participant will regularly buy a bit of bitcoin.
This would be like a communal DCA ( dollar cost averaging). Its will happen every week, and would be a good time to buy bitcoin as any, if you want to buy bitcoin. 
An average buyer could buy anywhere from $50-$500 per week, and if 1000 buyers buy it in the same hour, we can cumulatively buy up to 5-50 bitcoins in an hour. And that's just for starters.

TA doesn't work, because there are far too many new comers into bitcoin.
A market in which buyers are increasing at rate of 50% or so every year can't have useful TA, because the new buyers will come with totally different expectations and valuations. And they do it everyday.
@_date: 2019-09-03 12:17:08

@_date: 2019-09-11 08:04:46
50% is a very high and likely wrong estimate.
But my larger point remains, about why TA is ineffective in any market with large new buyers, and even large new sellers. 50% of all bitcoins haven't been moved in a year.

I just read that the miners are dumping 1800 bitcoins everyday in the market. This is obviously creating a sell pressure, which is keeping the price down. Thats why the price is around $10k for almost three months now. Why can't we just change the protocol so that they can't dump this much coins every day? 1800 coins everyday is too much. Lets change it to something like 20 coins a day. Also, I'm just messing with you here. Sue me, I'm bored.

If 90% of all my assets weren't already invested in crypto, I'd be buying as much as I could. 
And the actual sum depends on how much cash you have. I personally would recommend using the cheapest phone, and saving on luxuries, so that you can invest as much as possible in bitcoin.   
I have a trick: If I have the option of buying two phones, one worth $500, and one worth $200 ( a real life situation), I do not consider that the difference is $300.   
For me, that difference of $300 is actually $3000, because that is how much I think bitcoin will be worth in just 1-2 years if I buy $300 worth of bitcoin today.   
So i use the cheapest phone I can use, and try to look for opportunities to buy bitcoin.

I am expecting 10k to hit in next 30-40 days.   
It rose 60% in last 40 days. There is no reason why it can't maintain the trend.
@_date: 2019-05-13 08:26:24
10k will be broken this year, in June. Even May is possible.

Even some whales don't own one full bitcoin. They normally keep their coin in separate address, and never togther.

yep, its all due to ~~someone in slush pool which mined that block~~ low fees. 
nothing fishy about it at all.

five years ago, bitcoin was at $400-$600 range.
and in march 2019, it was barely ten times that much.
so bitcoin was very undervalued. in five years, you'd expect bitcoin to grow at least 20-100 times. 
so the target price today is about $8000-$40000 usd.

They were not owning slaves. They were just employing unpaid workers who jid not have basic human rights. 
The war wasn't about slavery. It was about the right to employ people without having to pay them minimum wage guaranteed by federal government. 
The southern states just disagreed about what should be the minimum wage. They wanted it to be zero.

8k in four days.
@_date: 2019-05-05 07:18:17
 my next target, where I'll even notice a movement (after its jump from 4k to 5k) is around 7500. 
After that next would be 15k.

point is that sentiment varies for company stock too, and its price moves accordingly. 
same for bitcoin.
they both move with sentiment.

Bitcoin just touched me.

electrum's latest server "bug" really scared me recently.
but since its open source, its safe enough I think.

Yes, we did it! Together.
I'm so proud of you all right now.

gold is not borderless. you're taxed if you transfer it across borders.

45 days ago, to be precise.

If I had $100 to invest, I'd invest $90 in bitcoin, and $10 in mutual funds.   
That is the percentage I'd go for initially.
If bitcoin rises, fine.   
If it falls, at least I will have 10% of my money remaining, and won't end up in poorhouse. Its a win/win.
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:33:26
In that case they're transacting with companies like zebpay.
Not individuals on lbc.

there is no such thing as "same" value. 
even bitcoin's value will fluctuate *if* it replaces dollar or money as we know it.
bitcoin's advantages over dollar are its digital, decentralized nature. Not that it will have "better" or "same" value.

140 million million people can have .15 btc each.
