Not sure sorry, I have actually use the btc network in years. Just an old lurker.

Go on and ask this for serious non-risky investment advice, and help securing and accessing your funds long term without family interference.

No. They could release a second transaction with higher tx fee and due to RBF that will have priority. Being in the mempool isn't confirmation. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:12:02
Yep! Wait til it's got a few confirmations.

Imagine if a major undersea cable was split. We'd see two chains until it was reattached.

Wow a range of 2000-6000. What a prediction

Core controls access to the GitHub where updates to cores client are posted. They posted an update banning s2x nodes for some crappy reasoning that doesn't hold up. 
Core controls the *discussion* on all major discussion platforms and code platforms. 
They use this power to stop any attempt of consenus being formed without their approval. This is clear as day and any attempt to refute it is pointless.

If you don't think the NYA is concensus, then Bitcoin is never going to achieve it. Looks like we're on ~2.7mb blocks forever (under ideal conditions) forever. Because getting 90+% miners, huge exchanges and wallet providers to compromise and agree is the best you can fucking hope for.
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:48:34
I should have clarified. I should have said: core, the poor people they've managed to brainwash, and the army of paid shills.
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:27:02
Fuck you cunt
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:01:29
You're wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:19:46
Still haven't heard a single solid reason with data to back it up why we shouldn't do 2x. In fact almost all core developers are on the record stating we need to increase blocksize eventually.
I do go to meet ups, and work in the space. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 07:34:53
Yeah it's totally bullshit. The NYA was an attempt to get consensus. Only core is stopping the hardfork because it's "contentious" when it's only contentious because core is refusing to budge. 
Core having unilateral veto power over any fork IS CENTRALISATION!
Its funny how they say they will support a fork if it has agreed community support, when the community isn't allowed to even fucking discuss it, and if some companies and miners try and show they are in agreement and form consensus, ALL DISCUSSION IS BANNED AND THE COMPANIES ARE TARRED AND FEATHETED. 
Fuck core.

Good luck having to launder the stolen BTC and actually cash them out without getting caught.

I'm using a smart contract to perform book builds for investing into different areas.
