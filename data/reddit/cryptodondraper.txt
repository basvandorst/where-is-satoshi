Well done gentlemen.

Ah, this line of thinking leads one down a narrower road still. Television networks will accept advertising money from just about anyone or anything these days - and they'll happily take money from a global open source software project that also happens to make a nifty payment network and worldwide bank replacement.

Nope. High enough on life to see what a miserable fuck Paul Krugman and other anti-economic freedom folk are.

This community has become so great.
@_date: 2014-11-26 18:47:10
Another reason this is such bullshit and the community should let ZDNet know what's up. For every person who read that irresponsible article, there were probably 10 who saw the tweet and headline - some of them may now have a lesser opinion of BTC. Currency wars are in full swing, awareness and perception matter.

Mark increasingly seems like a clueless statist who struck it rich a decade ago selling a proof of concept broadband video site before broadband existed. 
Gonna start tuning this guy out. Enjoy watching your fiat billions decline and decline as you double down on flawed outdated ideology. You and Buffett can have a little cry and a hug in a year or two.

Thanks for the tip, and the tips. I like the idea of possibly depersonalizing the State, making it just Agent Smith types instead of a commanding older stateswoman. 
One thing I would be more hesitant about is altering the outcome. If the State wins and everything is Bitcoin gravy train by the end of our commercial spot, it's as if we are *gloating* in a sense. "Look at how great we are, aren't we great?" It's proud posturing that can alienate the public. This is why things like Amway and Herbalife freak most of us out. Telling us you're great when all we see are overpriced supplements.
By ending on a less certain note, the commercial can enlist the help of the public. We haven't made it yet. But we are getting there. The Queen's change of heart is meant to also mirror how governments have softened some of their views toward bitcoin over the past year.
But I will think on it, thanks again! : )

Good point.
He espouses views most of us share, and if anyone with bad intentions attacks his reputation, there are 100s of us willing to step up to the plate and speak the same truths (albeit in a less talented way).
@_date: 2014-09-14 01:38:02
We disagree here. BitPay and Coinbase are the gas stations; we are the oil men. They'll sell it, and make some money doing so. But this is our product, and it's about to be *our* world, unless some crap knock-off State-backed or Fortune 500 company backed "decentralized" token gets there first...markets directly to the masses, knows that a great idea still does have to be sold, initially.
@_date: 2014-09-14 00:52:25
by the way, the commercial can close with "accepted by leading companies including Dell and TigerDirect, and soon to be accepted by participating PayPal merchants"
you'd be amazed how many people I encounter daily who have NEVER heard of Bitcoin ("a bit what?"), and who have no idea major companies are already getting behind this promising currency. PayPal is accepting us only to hedge the possibility of Bitcoin becoming the next major Internet payment system. Don't expect them to go out of their way advertising Bitcoin to the masses, and Coinbase and Bitpay's margins are too thin to expect massive advertising campaigns from them... this is the community's time to shine and make history.

I guess JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citi and the other too big to fail proprietary ledgers are pretty big ponzis by that metric, then.
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:59:55
Absolutely. Fucking enrich those fuckers.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:21:52
Agree. Everyone's watching the chart waiting for some green spikes, and once we get it, I think BTC will break through prior all-time highs without slowing down.
$2.1k by January is my guess at this point, and $6k by end of 2015.

Honored to have the President of Bitcoin visit this thread.
Hopefully some members of the Bitcoin Supreme Leadership Council will make an appearance as well.

Excellent point.

Several interesting observations in this article, including how Russia's dislike for Bitcoin plays into things.
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:49:32
This is super cool, the demo video is a nice touch. Questions: how are you able to operate legally? how can people trust that they will actually receive coins every time they 'shapeshift' with your service?
and are there plans to open the gates beyond doge and ltc to some of the newer coins? Thanks!
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:40:42
yeh bro, totally inconvenient to wait for 10 minutes for complete certainty and ownership of money sent to me. Better to wait until tomorrow (today's Sunday), wait in line at a bank, show my state ID, engage in some small talk, sign a form or two and pay $10 for a cashiers check which if I lose, I'm sorta fucked.

Do as Satoshi suggested and never delete your wallet, young one.

Also the USMS has now auctioned Bitcoin to the public, and is about to do it again in a larger quantity. I guess this guy should tell the United States Marshals Service they are selling illegal goods. LOL

If I call the Moon "filled with cheese," NASA doesn't change their description of lunar geological composition.
I'll ignore the "you guys" assertion as if every digital currency user or person browsing this sub is member of some secret universal hive mind.
Instead, judging by your username, you might think bitcoin is along the lines of the tulip mania we have read so much about in our econ textbooks. As someone thinking of reducing my crypto investment in part due to this uneven regulatory response from governments, why should I?

His bullshit appears on Google News whenever anyone in the world searches for "Bitcoin" and the news publication ZDNet is the banner that bullshit is packaged under, not "ken hess' blog"
If it were "ken hess' blog" I don't think any of us would give a shit.
He's misusing his platform. He is dishonest. And what the community is doing in response is completely justified and will deter others in the future from spreading dishonesty that harms human progress simply to make a few bucks as a crap freelance article writer.
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:06:53
This looks really great! Not sure if it's possible but it'd be cool to design it such that the deals are sorted randomly - giving each deal equal exposure within its category, instead of all the merchants toward the bottom probably not getting as much exposure and clicks.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:32:42
Smart. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 00:42:13
Bigger than the PayPal news. **This is significant:** now thousands of coffeeshops and restaurants will be able to allow customers to pay in bitcoin. yes, the store has to 'opt-in' but that's just a flick of the switch. having the service built in and an option is what's crucial here. make your restaurants running NCR Silver aware of bitcoin when the service launches; ask to pay with it. Make this the most insanely successful new thing NCR has ever added to one of their systems
@_date: 2014-06-14 05:12:37
I agree. Vert and Myr aren't infallible alternatives, which is part of why they're only a small part of my holdings. they're just alternatives. The GHASH issue is, for now, specific to Bitcoin since they haven't focused their service on any of these smaller coins (yet-wouldn't put it past them).

Everyone is so fucking down on tulips, I quite like them. Although very hard to keep alive - if you're just entering the flower foray, I'd recommend something more hardy like orchids.

Cryptocurrency is clearly an eventual worldwide bank network replacement. If you don't understand why this is, you're not talking to the right people.
Although Bitcoin could end up being the predecessor to something eventually superior, at the moment its the biggest and safest, at a time when the world for a variety of geopolitical, financial, and technological reasons is beyond ripe for an explosion in peer to peer money usage.

It is not just you, others have seen the prophecy as well. Just as Satoshi foretold, it will happen.

"Mining" is really built-in inflation. Instead of the State getting all the money created over time, it is distributed amongst those who lend their computing power to keeping the network's transactions validated and processing on time.

I used Fiverr several times the other day paid with Bitcoin each time. I was logged into my coinbase account so it was *literally* a one click process. Magic Internet money.

There's a great saying, "If you want to be understood... Explain."
When encountering that stuff, lately I take the time to send the person to bitcoin.org (at the minimum) so they can watch the intro video, read some basics, and know it is absolutely very cool stuff. From there, they will either look into it further and *get it*, or they won't. You can't lead a horse to water, but you're an influencer at an elite university filled with supposedly smart people so there's quite a multiplier/ripple effect if you correct just that one person's misconceptions or indifference with a few moments of focused discussion.

Not sure if troll or genuinely concerned about the community's well being. Either way, I'm happy to answer: I think it's a good idea for this community, which is 143,000 strong just here on reddit, to begin flexing its muscles.
We've all seen months of FUD from a handful of people in the media who seem to be dishonest and motivated by some kind of weird vendetta. Personal views on new technologies is fine. But that article, and his other pieces, are riddled with lies and non-logic.
We know this stuff is crap, but many readers on Google News (where his stuff comes up) go "oh I guess Bitcoin is on its way out then". Those older readers, although less tech savvy than you and me perhaps, are equally entitled to a prosperous future. This joker is hoodwinking them and I don't like it. Obviously I'm not alone in this thinking or my post wouldn't have gotten more than 1,000 upvotes.
We do not have to be pacifists. And Bitcoin is not entitled to win out. If we don't fight for it, we may not get it.
ZDNet will drop this contributor. This community is going to make sure of that.
And when that occurs, other delusional statist trolls in the media will think twice before hinging their careers on destroying a great, still growing technology. Set an example with this one and we (hopefully) need not do it again.

I'm not opposed to paying capital gains, that makes sense.
It is misclassified. Should I get a mortgage deduction for a pair of shoes? Shoes aren't a home, therefore that would be inappropriate.

This is a point I had not considered really, and it is well taken. I have no plans of posting anything else about ZDNet or that guy and I agree the focus is better spent on showing newcomers all the awesome things bitcoin enables that wasn't possible before.

definitely need an AMA. Since when should tech journalists be "lobbying" against open source software projects they aren't keen on.
