I hope that is a small percentage of your total funds... Diversify.

This is my top reddit comment. Hats off. (Also do not put ALL your money into bitcoin, diversify your risks)

Don't go above 25% ($5k) investment. It might rise it might collapse. We do not know yet. If it goes too the moon you will have moon/4 of your investment which will secure your future. If it goes to 0, which it could do VERY quickly you still have most of your savings intact. As an example I personally have 6% of my portfolio in my bitcoin. I look at it this way. If it takes off, maybe I can buy a house extra. If it collapses I can still buy a house.

Why are you down voting this guy? Do you think reddit affects the price? You are all small fish.

So I appreciate the thought. I own bitcoin but that mind set is dangerous. You might lose everything and the experiences of your youth. Balance is key.

Its also the reason why bitcoin has no value. Great feature though!.

Long term game? Really. Did you ever do normal investing?

I bought in 2013 and sold in 2014. Lost almost 50%. It was not coffee money either. If I kept them I would be able to buy a house.

Thats just plain stupid. If you think its going to the moon. You can put 10% of your savings into it. Thank me later.

How many tulips for one bitcoin?
(Dont downvote I own a few tulips and I do not want the price to drop)
