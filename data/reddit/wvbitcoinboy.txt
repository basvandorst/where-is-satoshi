100 bits. Valid point.
What wallet are you using that can't alter the fee? The devs need to edit that wallet's code and allow it. 
It seems like paying higher fees would be such a simple answer to the blocksize problems until sidechains, offchain transactions and lightning mature a little.

Touché. I haven't dealt with exchanges, so that's something I'm new to and can't speak for. Good to know that's a cheaper way of doing it, though. 
Maybe doing OTC would be even better with such a large sum of coins? Would be nearly 760 coins. Sounds like the kind of lump sum an investor would want to buy up real quick and easy without moving the market. lol

Thanks man. I love Bitcoin... I've always been poor and I'm racking my brain daily trying to figure out how to offer enough value in this new economy to just have enough to make it... I want nothing more than to help Bitcoin succeed, and help anybody succeed that wants to help Bitcoin succeed.

My intent IS to charge you $100/hour for my time. I do it with my personal business, and it flies without MSB/FinCEN intervention... If I give you the Bitcoin as a gift, or even as a refund after you give me cash, I don't see how there's an issue. There is no "KYC rules" in my normal line of business...
I just think it's BS I've found a way to make money that's not hurting anybody and it's regulated so heavily when 99% of other areas to make business isn't regulated. I guess Bitcoin is another case of being "regulated out of business."
EDIT: I don't sell bitcoin right now, even though I have ads up... I never respond to them. I've just been curious what the interest is. So far, I've turned down taking over $1000 in the past month for fear of breaking a law.

I would say this is true, except my ISP just started capping data about 6 months after offering 101 mbps. 
You can have 101mbps, but you can only use 1TB(1024GB) of bandwidth in a month... so let's do that math... (1024MB*1024MB[for a GB])/12.625MBps/60sec/60minutes=23 hours... 
So if you were to run that pipe full blast (and why shouldn't you be allowed to?!) You would use your MONTHLY allocations in a little under a day... WHAT A JOKE.

Interesting, I haven't used the QT client since I mined with it, I don't really know anything about it. Perhaps something I should dig into and learn about.
But instead of running stupid stress tests that prove nothing other than we can fill a block (which we already knew anyway) why not start fixing the "blocks are filled" problem before it even becomes a problem WITHOUT a hard fork?! I'm really just wondering what the DOWNSIDE is to what I'm proposing? The only thing I can think of is we wouldn't be much of a rival to Western Union anymore if the fees end up making it up to $5 to include a fraction of a penny transaction... raising the block size DOES allow us to stay competitive with other ways of moving money and lets us continue to do it SO SO SO much cheaper.
If I understand correctly, if blocks aren't full, they will even mine transactions with ZERO fees that are in the mempool? Is that correct?

My parents gave me Bitcoin for Christmas a few years back and I got all kinds of hate comments saying I made it up. They are definitely believers. I've also gotten another person on the bandwagon here recently. I'm trying VERY hard to get it going locally to kinda of supplant the USD, if at all possible. Even wanting to try to get a few local municipalities to accept it for taxes, even if only through Bitpay to get their precious fiat... I think it would be an amazing step.
I think the biggest reason I'm so very passionate about Bitcoin is because I live in one of the most backwards states in the union, no I'm not in Mississippi, but the state everyone knows as backwards incest, cousin-loving hillbillies. It's like my dream to prove that stereotype wrong in any way I possibly can and leave that legacy for my children to carry on... it's time West Virginia shows we aren't different than everyone else for the most part. I mean, we all have cell phones glued to our faces like everyone else in the country. We need to put them to good use and use them as our wallets and start acting like we are part of the 22nd century instead of being stereotyped like we are from the the 18th.

I'm not sure how to kickstart that initial "value collection." I need people to buy .25BTC in your scenario based upon trust in what I say being true, but all the while, they'll think I'm telling them this so they'll make my stake worth more. The negative press has people believing all kinds of crazy things about Bitcoin, and I don't know how to educate the masses about it. Most of them haven't even heard of it.
I was checking out a local news Facebook page, and they asked if Mancini was right in wanting to ban Bitcoin and there was more "what's Bitcoin?" answers than I'd have expected knowing about Bitcoin for so long now, but most people don't.
Then you could use the argument, "it's to defeat the bankers and IRS and crazy overreach of power they have" but then some people will order you a tinfoil hat, and I don't believe that's the correct approach to sell our "product." I think we need to look at Bitcoin as that... a PRODUCT. It's a product that has had as much as $14Billion market cap. That's A LOT of money, so if people are willing to put $14Billion into it, what's needed to get us to the next step? What can we upgrade and do or what points can we sell to get to $25Billion market cap?! We need that next innovation. I'm hoping Ethereum is it, but who knows? I hear it's a scam and all this, but I heard it about Bitcoin, too. If Ethereum is the next big thing and I know it, why wouldn't I promote it as a scam so that I can get in low and early? It's a genius plan... personally I think if they can deliver with Ethereum, this project I'm trying to tackle would be a lot easier. I could issue a local currency by buying ether with Bitcoin, then we could eliminate bankers and brokers because of the contract abilities. There are so many possibilities, I wish I had more people to talk to about this locally to get it off the ground and start making these dreams reality. I dream entirely too much, and do entirely too little.

I'm impatient on there being more adoption. NOT seeing my stake go up. Colored coins make my stake go up INSTANTLY if I want to set .1BTC to the value of MY CAR or something. I can care less about that. I just want to see that adoption REQUIRE ONE TRILLION DOLLARS. It means some major players have gotten in. All these little companies (OVERSTOCK, Yeah, I said it. LITTLE) accepting it, is nothing. I say little company because most of the sales in Bitcoin was from NEW customers. That's telling you not many people shopped there in the first place. Try to get the statistic of more NEW customers than old customers at Wal Mart or Amazon or McDonald's EVERYONE is an old customer at those places.
We need WAL MART, DOLLAR GENERAL, MCDONALD'S, and some other places like that to accept it and we may see adoption increase a million percent overnight because it'd be in everyone's face.

Why would we even allow governments to do things like this? They'd have no financial power. They can't just "print" more money to go to war and pay wages to make ammunition or armored cars or anything else. With Bitcoin, YOU HAVE YOUR VOTE BACK. The vote you never had with the dollar because they print em, spend em, then they get to you and inflation has already sucked their value away because the ones at the top are printing more to play with making your money worth less when you finally get it. Bitcoin is the answer to ALL money problems. It really is. ANYTHING that removes a central bank, is the answer. 
Why do you think Lincoln got killed? Over the greenbacks, perhaps? 
They tried to kill Jackson, but the guns didn't fire. He actually got rid of the central banks cartel bastards, too!

Is "Slaves" offensive to you? I've never heard the expression you used before so I suppose I'll just try to validate my point further.
Slave - a person who gives up his freedom to do whatever he pleases in order to make another more rich or prosperous.
That's my definition of the word, and I think it's pretty close to the dictionary one, "(n) a person who is excessively dependent upon or controlled by something."
I'm pretty sure we are dependent upon Fiats because if we don't pay the tax collector, we are threatened with imprisonment or our life being taken away. The only reason the dollar has any value is because it's been used to rape and pillage ANY country with a smaller military to steal all their natural resources. America was FOUNDED on the principal of stealing by force. It's the 21st century, now they just control you by money to give you the illusion that you are "free." Free to have any job you want, free to have a family that you must work HARDER for just to provide for them only to go further into debt and have to work harder again. 
It's a joke. 
Bitcoin is the anti-joke.

Who are they going to stop? What "entity" are they going to blow up? We're all faceless, and corpseless on this thing called the internet. We are digital beings while we are "jacked in." You can't bomb a bit or a byte… reminds me of the Hacker Manifesto… you may kill or bomb one of us, but you can't bomb or kill us all...
HACKER MANIFESTO
 Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  "Teenager
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...
        Damn kids.  They're all alike.
But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,
ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
        I am a hacker, enter my world...
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.
I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain
for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  "No, Ms.
Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head..."
        Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.
I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                Or feels threatened by me...
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.
And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through
the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is
        "This is it... this is where I belong..."
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
        Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...
You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We've been dominated by sadists, or
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.
This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,
but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

@_date: 2014-01-10 16:44:30
That's very interesting. 
The one thing about the whole thing that I can't believe is, we're in the midst of a DECENTRALIZATION revolution and people are putting down the idea of creating altcoins. I don't understand where people got off thinking that BITCOIN should be worth millions of dollars and control all the commerce (or even 1% of it) in the world.
Seems like it makes sense to have more "Satoshi Nakamotos" on a more local scale everywhere. That would allow for even the COINS to be decentralized. Not to mention, it's an incentive for people to work harder because the more WORK that is put into any certain coin, the more it becomes worth. 
I don't understand why Bitcoin itself isn't just used as an "asset" like "Gold." Then, we could use altcoins with quicker block times and more coins to be mined. This would allow more people to mine them and use them locally. Also whatever else makes the system more of a currency than an asset should be considered in the new "coin" as well. Just my ideas to decentralize further. The banks can still take down the internet, but can they take down thousands of small personal area networks that are all over the place?
I sound crazy, but then again, Bitcoin apparently sounds crazy to someone who isn't into it's intricacies, like I am. At least that's what Facebook has shown me. Doesn't make sense why people feel the need to understand Bitcoin, yet they never took a single monetary class on the dollar to understand fractional reserve banking, or how their deposits are the basis of 10 TIMES that amount of money for a bank or how inflation isn't prices rising, it's monetary supply being pumped up, etc.
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:15:56
Why would we need to spread that burden if money weren't based on debt in the first place? Who would we pay "BACK" there would be no private central bank that needs paid back. The government would have printed some money, given it out to those who created services and goods to support the war, and it would have spurred the economy and it would have kept growing… and guess what… NOBODY NEEDS PAID BACK. :)

Some of us don't WANT to be in a corporate boardroom, nor do we care about "corporate finances" or anything of the sort. Some of us just want to be around good people that care about each other and help each other out. Most of us would rather NOT have the headaches that corporations that don't support people, but profits, bring…. there is no point talking to you, because you're too "bought" by the system that Bitcoin was created to go up against.
And they don't have to "issue debt" to make the money that would be in citizen's hands, you're using your brainwashed corporate cog mind. Bitcoin didn't issue coins based on debt. Oh yeah, it did. The debt of computer processors and cheap energy in the beginning to get it going. Not much debt there…. Where was the debt behind John F. Kennedy's silver standard? Tell me that. Where was the debt when Lincoln made greenbacks? WHERE?! There wasn't because there wasn't a private institution (CORPORATION) charging the government money to make money. That's stupid. Why would you PAY MONEY TO MAKE MONEY WHEN YOU ARE THE GOVERNMENT?! It goes back to the quote I put, whether real or not, is correct. You just can't wrap your mind around it, and that's okay.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS:
The current monetary system has monetized LABOR. That's stupid with all the other things to base money on. Silver, gold, cryptography… ANYTHING other than labor. When you base your monetary system on labor, you effectively enslave everyone to the corporate machine. Some of us, again, don't want shit to do with that messed up system of slavery.

Central banking, as it is, only exists to usurp people of their wealth. Why else would a central banker (a Rothschild) say this:
“If that mischievous financial policy, which had its origin in the North American Republic, should become indurated down to a fixture, then that Government will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay off debts and be without a debt. It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce. It will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of the civilized governments of the world. The brains and the wealth of all coun­tries will go to North America. That govern­ment must be destroyed, or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.”
The Bankers obviously understood. The only thing, I repeat, the only thing that is a threat to their power is sovereign govern­ments printing interest-free and debt-free paper money. They know it would break the power of the international Bankers.
But hey, believe what you want! :)

I just wish more people would dig before starting conspiracy theories and throwing around a bunch of FUD. It seems like as of late, that's all you see or hear about Bitcoin. Even overstock.com isn't seeming like as big of a deal as it would of had it happened a year ago. It seems like people are only into this because they hear "Oh, you're money will double or triple or shoot up 10000% over the next xyz number of years. 
If anybody will do ANY research back in 2009, you will see that this is just a regular developer. He was probably some genius geek in his parent's basement, eating hot pockets and drinking caffeinated soda from thinkgeek.com.
Off the original sourceforge page:
"Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network based anonymous digital currency. Peer-to-peer (P2P) means that there is no central authority to issue new money or to keep track of the transactions. Instead, these tasks are managed collectively by the nodes of the network. Anonymity means that the real world identity of the parties of a transaction can be kept hidden from the public or even from the parties themselves. Advantages:
Transfer money easily through the internet, without having to trust third parties.
Third parties can’t prevent or control your transactions.
Be safe from the unstability caused by fractional reserve banking and the bad policies of the central banks. The limited inflation of the Bitcoin system’s money supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) throughout the network, not monopolized to the banks.
Bitcoin’s value is likely to increase as the growth of the Bitcoin economy exceeds the inflation rate - consider 
Bitcoin an investment and start running a node today!
Bitcoin is an open source project created by Satoshi Nakamoto, and is currently in alpha development stage."
Doesn't sound like malicious intent to me.

A p2p currency is the best idea that has ever been made. FINALLY, we can all quit being slaves to the banks, if we all will choose that path.

I just assumed if they broke 'encryption' then that would break the cryptography that makes Bitcoin work? May have erred in my way of thinking there. I don't know a lot about cryptography, tbh. As a matter of fact, MOST of what I know about it, I've learned because I'm so into Bitcoin and have just kind of fell down the rabbit hole and learned about other things related to Bitcoin.
Thanks! I'm sick of being sick. This flu going around the Northeast is a doozy! Not taking any medicine, INCLUDING alcohol. I hate pharmaceuticals, unless they are absolutely medically necessary to keep me from dying. I prefer to let mother nature work and rid my body of the problems it gets. Seems to work so far in my young age. Not so sure as I get older, though. :( Oh well!

"Money as Debt"
Talks about how the debt monster has to keep growing to keep the system afloat. If the debt isn't growing, neither is the monetary supply. Our money is created based on our promise to work hard. But we are working hard to propagate a system that is only making us work harder while giving us less. Seems silly. Bitcoin is a much better way to deal with things. Forget a central authority. We don't need one! We have proven it with Bitcoin… and if it will just make it through this dreaded "STUCK AT $300 CRISIS" and start going back up and people would get more educated, this could be the thing the bankers were scared of.
“If that mischievous financial policy, which had its origin as Bitcoin, should become indurated down to a fixture, then Bitcoin will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay off debts and be without a debt. It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce. It will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of the civilized governments of the world. The brains and the wealth of all coun­tries will go to Bitcoin. Bitcoin must be destroyed, or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.” SEE?! IT FITS.

I'm told I don't understand finance when you don't know what debt-free money is? As well as interest free? Do you know the Federal Reserve system charges interest to the Treasury for every dollar it makes. What sense does that make? Why aren't the dollars just being thrown out of helicopters by the treasury itself without HIRING someone to do the job of MONEY CREATION? They don't really need to throw money out of planes, it's a hyperbole. But my point is… there'd be no reason NOT to throw it out of military helicopters into the streets because no harm is done if some is destroyed. Not like we "NEED" that. It's just lost economic possibility that creates services and goods. It's only more money that can flow to make things happen, that falls to the ground. It's not like if half of them get burned or wash down into the sewer it even matters… because the interest isn't there. If our current dollars "evaporated" how are you going to pay the debts back to the private institutions (central banks that aren't governmental in the least) if you lost some of that money? You already can't pay the interest because it doesn't exist. It's a game of musical chairs right now. And we are running out of chairs.
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:14:35
The central bankers tried to charge Abraham Lincoln 30% for bringing the south back in and that's why he created the greenbacks. We don't need DEBT BASED money in the first place. That's the problem. EVERY DOLLAR IN YOUR POCKET IS OWED TO SOMEONE TO PAY OFF A DEBT. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. Are the Bitcoin you have owed to someone? NO. They aren't. They were made debt-free. The way ALL money should be, if it weren't for these private, for-profit, usurping central bankster bastards. (and their dog, too. lol)

Thank you. I've been losing confidence in Bitcoin, but the two of you that have responded so far are really putting the fire back in my jets.
Thanks guy, I'm going to try to get this stuff adopted by more local people and get people to start using it to trade each other. I think maybe I should re-research about the money system and see how they got people to accept the USD. The only thing is, I know how. By WAR. By conquest. They go kill people and rebuild them and get them to only sell oil and goods in USD. That gives it the network effect, but it's by force. There has to be a way to get the network effect to happen because of peace. Bitcoin is anti-war... wonder how many people in this day and age you could win over with that argument? I need something that resonates with MANY MANY MANY people to win them over to my (our) way of thinking.

@_date: 2014-10-21 18:38:41
I think what you are misunderstanding is that taking on "debt" at the personal level is fine. It's when your WHOLE monetary system is based on debt and requiring people to WORK to pay off that interest. If EVERYONE paid off every debt that exists at the central bank level, there would be NO money in existence. Money is debt. Debt is money. If the treasury just made the money, then all the money in circulation wouldn't be owed to someone else and if everyone paid off their debts, there'd still be money floating around to enable commerce to continue. It's why we went after Germany with England. They devised the most superior monetary system ever. Central bankers couldn't have that...

1861: President Abraham Lincoln (16th President of the United States from 1860 till his assassination in 1865) approaches the big banks in New York to try to obtain loans to support the ongoing American civil war. As these large banks were heavily under the influence of the Rothschilds, they offer him a deal they know he cannot accept, 24% to 36% interest on all monies loaned. Lincoln is very angry about this high level of interest and so he prints his own debt free money and informs the public that this is now legal tender for both public and private debts. 
1862: By April $449,338,902 worth of Lincoln's debt free money has been printed and distributed. He states of this, "We gave the people of this republic the greatest blessing they ever had, their own paper money to pay their own debts." That same year The Times of London publishes a story containing the following statement, "If that mischievous financial policy, which had its origin in the North American Republic, should become indurated down to a fixture, then that government will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay off debts and be without a debt. It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce. It will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of civilized governments of the world. The brains and the wealth of all countries will go to North America. That government must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe."

I'm not looking at it in terms of getting rich because my holdings are worth 75-80 times what they are now. I'm saying that means THAT MUCH CAPITAL is needed to float the system and keep it running. $10Billion dollars worth of commerce, isn't, frankly, jack shit. Look at the world cash supply.

Bitcoin is always going to see short-term swings as long there are people wanting to hold fiat. I can't begin to guess if it'll hit $2k and crash... Nobody can. The market decides where it goes. I DO think it will SOMEDAY hit $10,000 or maybe $100,000... But not because it's gained more value as much as because fiat will have lost that much value. All fiat systems have died in the past. So will the ones we have now. Just a matter of time to see if Bitcoin will have the same fate. I'd like to believe Bitcoin is finally the solution, but we shall see. Nobody can predict the future. If they claim to, it's to steal your hard earned money. ;)

There is always a risk, anyway. Anybody could take the bitcoin out of their exchanger's wallet and then tell the bank they want to dispute the charges.

Just paid $0.015 to transact and be confirmed in the very next block within 9 minutes. I'd call that "low fees..." and very INSTANT compared to a bank. Not to mention, the odds of someone having 51% of the network is so phenomenally low for most of our day-to-day transactions... worrying about someone reversing it seems silly.

I just want to help someone with a cell phone start a bank for their tribe/village/town/city/state in a nation that can't do that. 
There has to be some way to talk to these people that have phones... 
They are connected to the same internet we are... aren't they? 
If not, what's the closest, last-step that IS connected to our internet that could maybe bridge the gap with wireless technology? 
Surely if I could get a hold of that person, I could send $200-$500 over there in Bitcoin and they have a wireless shop that would sell them a pair of masts and wifi antennas for it?

Because Bitcoin could move hundreds or thousands to a trusted party. They could use the coin to back paper, even. We are talking groups of 50 people or less... they wouldn't need advanced counterfeiting measures like we do... I think it could work. Imagine supplying the money for people to transact within a village to end up building a third-world village. That would make you sleep well at night, right?

More like confusing Roger Ver to be a legitimate actor and not using all of his BTC to spam Bitcoin and get more people to pump his alt coin up. 
Looking forward to Litecoin bumping BCH down another place, to be honest if Charlie Lee is right. 
Bitcoin, I've been here with you since 2010. I'm not going anywhere! I BELIEVE. Do you believe?! :D
Side note: That spam attack lasted over 13 months! Hopefully this has moved the Bitcoin from the bad actors, to better ones. Afterall, WHOEVER was spamming, spent a lot of their BTC doing it, and HOPEFULLY doesn't have much left to do it anymore. How funny it'd be if Satoshi was behind all the spam trying to get us to move our asses on a solution. lol

How can you be a money exchanger or a "money transfer business" when Bitcoin is considered a commodity?
Or did that change somewhere along the line over the past few years and bitcoin is now considered money? Or am I looking at this backwards, and it's because the USD is being exchanged for something... still USD is exchanged for good and services every day and nobody is ever required to get a MSB license?? I'm confused.

I think a better way to get Bitcoin adopted would be to OFFER to pay people in BTC for their goods/services. I'm working on snagging a good paying job, and plan to get SOMEONE to mow my yard for bitcoin, cut my hair for bitcoin, pay my bills with my bitcoin, etc... Basically, using Bitcoin to delegate jobs that I don't want to do, but won't pay cash, because I'm TRYING to get bitcoin adopted.
I don't know if it'll work, but it's worth a shot. I've been following the movement since around January of 2012, and knew about it back in 2009. STILL trying to figure out a way to make my holding turn into more, but not letting go of them until I figure out a way to do it. I want to be in the &lt;500,000 CLUB aka, holding 42 BTC.

This the reason we are moving toward statelessness very slowly. Hard to enforce two or more countries' conflicting laws when two or more parties are transacting. I don't understand how a Bitcoin transaction isn't above the law. The "contract" is the fiat currency of the government that is decided upon in court. With Bitcoin, you never even agreed to be under a "state's" jurisdiction. 
We will just have to see how this pans out in the long run.
@_date: 2016-10-19 17:26:24

@_date: 2015-03-04 04:57:27
The simple, straightforward answer would probably be that you are used to using the World Reserve Currency ONLY to transact. So it doesn't change much, because everything ELSE changes relative to it.
To people who use USD, prices don't seem to change much (other than inflation) but when someone, NOT using USD, wants to buy things, they will see the price changes day-to-day and week-to-week because of the fluctuations in price of the other currency against the USD. 
One of the biggest reasons US fights so hard to keep oil priced in USD ONLY. ;)
@_date: 2016-05-11 14:13:28
Just enter your bank info, yes. You can also use a debit card, I believe.  There's a $200 limit at first, IIRC, then they raise it as you use it all up and keep maxing it out. They will raise it to 3,000/week, someone correct me if its $2000.

Voluntarysm is a lot better than Anarchy in the simple fact, there are at least THREE common sense rules that protect people's achievements. In anarchy, murder, raping and pillaging are allowed, THEN dealt with via mob rule doing whatever they decide is the correct punishment.
Voluntaryism is a philosophy that advocates for complete individual freedom through recognition of self-ownership, property rights and adhering to the non-aggression principal.
Self-Ownership, is the principal that you, and not the state, 100% own your own body and are the sole-decider of what you put into your body, how you treat yourself, or if you want to end your own life if you so choose.
Property Rights is the principal that you, and not the state, 100% own the fruits of your own labor. Which includes, justly acquired income and possessions. Your free to do with your property as you choose, which includes destroying it, passing it down to future generations, selling it or giving it away.
Non-Aggression Principal is the principal that you will not use force to infringe on the freedoms of another individual and expect the same treatment for yourself. The only exception to this is if someone is using force against you, then using force via self-defense is completely just and fine. We are not complete pacifists, every animal recognizes the need for self-defense to ensure survival. Hence, the existence of claws, fangs, venom and poison in the natural world.
We all live in three temporal plains, past present and future. These are signified by property, liberty and life. 
The past is signified by property, as this is the representation of your past labor and time spent. AKA, the fruits of your labor. Violation of justly acquired property would be theft.
The present is signified by your liberty or the ability to move freely and do as you please. So long as it doesn’t infringe on the basic freedoms of another individual. Violation of liberty would be assault, rape, slavery or involuntary servitude.
The future is the ability to live out your life to fullest possible lifespan. Violation of life would be murder.
Voluntaryism dictates that all interactions between peaceful individuals should be voluntary and consensual. There is never a reason for the curtailment of the aforementioned freedoms. If such a person attempts to do so, then you must resist him or her to the extent that it is humanly possible. This is regardless if such a person is a family member, friend, stranger, or government agent.

TLDR: Investing in this thing is awesome, because it's going to go up, even if it's very slowly and at an "up and down pace." Getting it adopted by new people, THAT'S the key to it's ultimate success. Become an evangelist and start screaming about it from rooftops... It worked for Apple.
People holding it as an investment is probably hurting the growth. The BTC people are deciding to hold, need to be used to bring more people into our fledgling economy, that don't already accept BTC. imho. Save a lot, but spend some, too!
Some people will disagree, actually A LOT will disagree with me, because A LOT more people invest in bitcoin than use it to transact daily. The best bet is, find a bank that will let you use Coinbase or Circle and not complain about it and buy bitcoin and spend it the same week somewhere you can get it accepted or somewhere that already accepts it. If you are worried about the price swings, buy it immediately before you want to spend it. Keep your 7 bitcoin in cold storage, use your .5, and buy more to transact with. That'd be the best bet. Don't use it for gift cards and such. That's not helping anybody but the big gift card merchants which already have an interest in it. Try to get people locally to accept it in place of dollars. The more people that accept it, the larger of a portion of the world economy uses it, and the more your 7 BTC holding will be worth because there are ONLY 21,000,000 coins to ever transact with. The more people wanting it for their wares, the more it will have to be worth to support the economy it's providing an exchange medium for. (Just look at the $6Trillion IRA market everyone is happy we are getting our toes wet in today with GBTC...)
Baby steps... "Be the change you want to see in the world." You can't hold EVERYTHING and expect everyone else to make merchants want to accept bitcoin. Morgan Spurlock was onto something when he got a coffee shop to accept it. Now anybody from our beloved subreddit can go there and get coffee from that day forward. THAT is pretty awesome!! It would have been more awesome if Morgan had found a place someone else had already inducted into our "club" in time for that documentary... the biggest downfall of that documentary was how hard it was to find something as simple as a daily staple in many people's lives like coffee. (Yes, I know you can get Starbucks cards for bitcoin, not the point) It really made the currency look HORRIBLE, imo, because it didn't seem to be accepted ANYWHERE when he REALLY needed it to be. The restaurant, while his stomach was killing him, is another example... It's not a bad currency or barter medium, though. People just need to learn about it and see how simple it really is. Once you have some on your phone, it's the most unbelievable simple transaction medium in existence. Scan a QR code, or copy/paste an address and send an amount. Lot easier than fumbling around in a wallet/purse for cash, credit cards, and the worst of all, the dreaded CHECK... Time for the e-crusades.
@_date: 2016-05-11 14:12:05
Most ATMs will verify an identity using a cell phone number. If that's the case, you put your cell phone number in, get a text, type the code from the text on the machine, choose a paper wallet or to send directly to your phone. I always scan a qr code from my phone. Then it asks you to deposit money. When you finish, you click finish and the Bitcoin is on your phone. :)

Didn't have to send a selfie back when I signed up, either, as far as I remember. Probably has to do with the Know-Your-Customer laws. The Robocoin ATM also takes a selfie and a picture of you driver's license. Silly when it's not considered a currency yet abides by currency rules.

WILL run... is there NOTHING developed already besides Gliph's marketplace (just found it since I posted)? It has no reputation system, no categorization and just isn't a very good implementation of a market. Silk road is the best method of doing commerce that I can find, so far. I mean, it didn't become the  dark web market for no reason.
I'm wondering if the source is available to clone it on the light web and disallow illicit items. That would work in itself. NOTHING needs to be developed. We just need a SR clone.
Also, it's not about how comfortable it is to ME. I don't give a shit if I'm selling NES games next to a cocaine listing. I just don't want my potential customers to be seeing the illicit items, and narrowing customer base to be TINY because of these illicit items being displayed. 
I want the 80-year-old that hates drugs and weapons and credit card scammers to buy my wares, or at least be browsing the site to happen to run into my wares. NO 80 year old is browsing a darknet market, nor wants anything to do with such a site. Those sites are why we Bitcoiners get such bad press. It's horrible that Bitcoin isn't in the limelight for better things than being what criminals use it for. (no judgment on the fact that things exist, really!) 
It's just sickening that this revolutionary technology is being slandered by SR and things like that and not having more money thrown at developing things to undermine the current system and get us in the direction of a better, decentralized world. 
Also, just so it's noted, I'm a Voluntaryist. I don't have any cares about what is sold and to whom it is sold. I believe if you aren't harming another person or their possessions, you should be able to do whatever you want.

Why do it for free when I'm sure there are a LOT of people that would be willing to put coin into the project. I'm sure even MORE people would put money into an escrow account, and as milestones are reached, release said funds. Seems like a good way to get things going. Ethereum is the same way. Although they held a fundraiser, yet it's still vaporware months and months later. I just don't understand why progress with Bitcoin-related things is so slow. It seems like the fiat equivalent of everything has been around for decades, if not centuries and working fine. I must be very dense or naive as to what's so hard about "algorithmizing" and digitizing things and making them happen.
At any rate, don't get me wrong, I appreciate you giving your time away and even doing the project! I'm VERY excited to be a user of the software once it comes out. I wasn't bashing. Just been becoming impatient because I was jumping up and down when I first heard about the project. I've been following you all since the project was announced which feels like it was a decade ago, even though it wasn't. Bitcoin time is at least 50x faster than normal clock time. ;)
Also, everybody went off on a p2p rant, and I wasn't even intending to talk about that. BitWasp seems to be the closest answer to the question I was asking, but it's not under active development any longer and it never made it to a full-blown market with users. I don't care about decentralization at this point. When it comes, I'll switch to it, for sure because I'm ALL for decentralizing EVERYTHING. Nature itself is decentralized. I just wanted to know the biggest thing close to Ebay where items I put up would get the most views. lol

How can you be an exchanger of USD -&gt; BTC and vice-versa LEGALLY in the United States without having a Broker license first and foremost? That's my big hangup. I'd love to start a small local exchange, but I have to know more, obviously. I want to be the first city/county to accept Bitcoin in 75% or more of stores. I think it's achievable as small as my county is. I also think it'll make people come here because it's a Bitcoin safe haven. Once that happens, development would probably go NUTS with all the wealth. It's a grandiose plan, but hey, crazy people are the ones who change the world, if Steve Jobs was right.

You have to compile the source from github. I've had it running, but it's tedious and the fact that it's tedious keeps people from getting involved.
The funny thing is, it's complete enough to allow listings to be posted. So I still don't understand why they haven't made an installer to allow people to start messing with it, and then improve upon the bugs as they are pointed out.
Seems like group collaboration and having hundreds or thousands of testers as it's being developed would make more sense than trying to complete the whole project then release it. It may go in a whole different direction if they'd allow more people to critique it now?

Not at all! I'm hoarding my own! It doesn't matter though. If everyone believes in their worth and holds onto them, it'll still work, FOR NOW. I'm not an economics scientist, and won't claim to be one or be arrogant like I am one. I just know that right now, the savers are propping the price up. If people weren't saving and just spending them all, the price would plummet because of basic supply vs demand. I'm not saying anybody is doing anything wrong. I'm saying the opposite, people that are just trying to do pump and dump are dip wads, really. They aren't going to affect the system in the long haul, and they are just slowing the ride up, that's all. 
I actually don't even fault them. Who am I to say they are "dip wads?" They could be in a financial rough place and need to cash out in order to pay their mortgage because they finally have the money to do so. Maybe from that perspective we should just see someone taking out 600BTC*CurrentRate earlier, may have just been some computer geek (who isn't these days) saving his family from financial ruin.
It's all about perspective.
EDIT: LISTEN, OKAY? Are you listening? I don't know what the hell I was drinking about 24 minutes ago, but I just realized this comment completely contradicted my original intent of ALL that writing. I'm not hoarding, I spent over $160 at bitcoinstore.com today. For whatever reason I took offense to the hoarding comment because I've been a hoarder until today when I decided to spend them at the peak of the $140 bitcoins. Don't know how I got lucky enough to catch that at the top and actually "save" money on my purchase. It shows in Blockchain that I've spent less now than I did when it originally went through! :D Always love that kind of purchasing power!!!!!

How could it have 100% when some customers bought in at $0.01 while others at $1,000? The discrepancy would be huge.
Customer A buys at $0.01 and purchases 100 for $1.00. 
The Exchange now has $1.00 on it's ledger.
Customer B buys in at $1000 and buys a single bitcoin.
The Exchange now has $1,001.00 on it's ledger.
Customer B decides to cash out their holdings. They hold $1,000 worth.
The Exchange now has $1.00 on it's ledger.
Customer A decides they want to cash out for their $100,000.
The Exchange doesn't know how to pay $999,999 of the debt they owe because they've never seen that kind of money in their life.
So see? Even with only two customers, you can't have 100% reserve.

But in the end, it seems just by purely logic reasoning, that those of us holding those bitcoins will be able to hire people for so much higher wages, thus allowing for more jobs. We could pay people again to become more educated (NOT INDOCTRINATED, BIG DIFFERENCE) we could spread wealth more easily, because no matter who you talk to that mined in the beginning, unless all thousand or so of them are "Scrooges," they won't care about giving away "$10,000USD" worth of bitcoins that, at the time, they got when there wasn't even an exchange to get USD converted. They did it in the beginning because they thought it was fun, a computer game, maybe. Maybe they knew someday it may change the world, no matter what the cause, the original holders of bitcoins did it for entertainment and purely hoping that it would change the world. Those are the people now in control of the vast majority of the wealth of bitcoins. When bitcoins are the most "expensive" currency to hold and they are trillionaires by today's standards, they are going to be the philanthropists that hold the token at that point. A huge shift from the greedy war-mongers and crazy lunatic politicians and world leaders we have. It's almost like BitCoin has the potentiality to restore humanity across the globe and eradicate the profiteering gluttons that we have for our government now.

Perhaps it's a good thing. Maybe it's an inbuilt mechanism as a bunch of newbies buy into it, not understanding the full value and use of bitcoin, they get shaken easily. They think, "Oh God, there's my life's savings" while all us seasoned people just see it as, Oh well, a bunch of people just got a hell of a good deal on the bitcoins they are buying in this dip.
Bitcoin is here, and it's staying. It may never become the official currency of the US or anything, but I think third world nations that are developed enough to have an internet structure of any kind whatsoever will be jumping on this to give them a means to finally have a good currency system.
You have to stop and think for a moment, how many nations opted out of Rothschild's Central Bank Scheme? How many of those nations are now intrigued by the idea of something that opposes central banking altogether? Many of those may pour their whole GDP into bitcoin. Wait till that crap starts happening. Hold onto your undies, ladies and gents, we're blasting to the moon when this starts happening with a couple smaller, second and third world countries.

I'm interested in this "brainwallet" concept. Funny I was just playing with the feature on bitaddress.org. I'll probably do some googling here shortly to see what brain wallets are all about. I'm assuming that with a brain wallet your funds are in cold storage and can't be touched until you put them back into the system. So I suppose you're telling me that you only leave what you need out, maybe even give yourself an allowance every month or couple weeks then put the remaining funds in a new brain wallet after you link that private key to say, blockchain.info. I'm just guessing here. Like I said, haven't used a brainwallet yet.

I guess being right defeats the purpose if I'm locked up in a jail cell. Hmph. This makes bitcoin LESS valuable in my eyes. You bet your ass I'm going to keep collecing them and actively finding ways to increase my share of them, but they really are going to end up over valued if they can't be used for TRUE freedom and anonymity. I thought that was the purpose, then a few weeks into studying bitcoin, I came to find they aren't even anonymous without jumping through a million hoops. What happened to "digital gold" and "digital cash" that everyone was jumping up and down about in the beginning? Now it almost seems as if they wanted to, the GOVERNMENT could have created this and have the software to map every address (since it's all transparent and out there) to the bank transactions that happened, and from there - know who spent money with who. The only ones that are anonymous at this point are the ones who created wallets while completely anonymized and now have coins sitting it in that have never been tied to their name, their personal transactions, or their IP address. If ANY of those things have ever been exposed in a BTC transaction you've done whether it was from MtGox, or just buying something and giving personal info, then you are no longer anonymous with that wallet or any wallet you send that money to without a lot of cover up. (for instance sending it through a mixer service) I'm not saying Bitcoin isn't an EXCELLENT idea and model for digital money, I just don't see how something better isn't going to come along that works more closely with anonymity in mind.

I had never thought about the LOSS of wealth if it went down like that. I suppose I've been thinking about it going to it's "true worth" and never had a doubt that it would "crash." I'm still not sure it will crash. The only thing that can make it crash is if everyone keeps saying it's going to.
It's only worth what the "Faith" dictates. I don't understand why so many people are speculating that it's going to crash. I understand the tulip bulb phenomenon, but this has real value. It's got so many upsides over the current model. I don't understand why more people aren't thinking along the lines of, "Well if the US dollar, being the crappy system that it is, has made it since 1913, when the new central banks took hold in America, then Bitcoin should be able to make it with no problem. It's how money should have been made to function in the beginning."
That's my way of thinking, and the reason I've never considered it having a HUGE correction. It's worth what it's valued at right now, if not MORE.

You're completely safe by going to bitaddress, letting the page load, disabling your internet, generating your paper wallet, print it, close the tab/window, clear your cache, then enable Internet access again.
That will be completely off the grid because they allow you to generate client-side. The server never knows the address was generated by that computer.

Bitfloor's security sucks from all my research. That is why I won't personally use it. Also, there is no trade volume there. Meaning, they may or may not have the capital to keep that exchange up in the long run. Without the fees on exchanges to pay the hosting bill, programmers, and any other people that make a salary, they can't make it in the long run. MtGox is as bad as the Fed itself, in my opinion. It allows the government to audit them and see EXACTLY who paid for bitcoins and from there, it's as simple as tracking them from one address to the next to see who you are.
Why not just have an exchange that runs (EVEN ON TOR) anonymously and you don't have to put anything more than a hushmail or tormail email in? That's the exchange I'd use to buy/sell in a second. I WANT MY ANONYMITY. It's the only reason I signed up for this currency in the beginning. I know I'm not alone in this way of thinking, either.

EDIT: Not to mention, it's a currency not BASED ON DEBT. That's really nice. At least every coin that someone has isn't owed to someone else. Unlike every USD you have in your wallet. It's all owed to someone else because it's a debt-based currency.

Thank you. This makes perfect sense. I think. I may be reading the words you wrote in a completely different fashion than what you meant. My brain is wound tighter than a drum right now over Bitcoin. I'm looking for my niche in the whole thing and browsing several different ways of making Bitcoin a way of life for me and my soon-to-be family.
So what you are basically saying is, the exchange doesn't keep a majority of the Bitcoin on hand that people purchase because they move them to other people whom have wallets on different platforms (blockchain.info, localbitcoins, random web escrow wallets like one on sealswithclubs.eu, etc) and then they have basically ran away with Bitcoin and left their fiat money behind for the exchange to use as it sees fit because the person has "used up" the value of the bitcoin on that exchange. It's basically "debt" that's been extinguished like when repaying a loan? 
If all this is correct, HOPEFULLY honest exchanges will leave that fiat money "on ice" for a year or more in case the entity that control the Bitcoin next comes in to redeem it. Chances are unlikely as long as there are a lot of Exchanges. Kind of like asking 10 people who they bank with and getting 4 or 5 answers.

I have a much better idea. How about you go post some skill you have that you can do remotely for someone and then make some bitcoin that way?
I don't mean to sound rude or like an asshole, I just think it's crap that everyone wants these things for free now that they cost money and everyone knows if they get in now in any amount, they'll be very wealthy in the near future. I paid for mine as most people did for their's. 
If you don't want to pay for them, don't expect a handout, we aren't in a debt-based society anymore. It's not hard to contribute to the economy and DO SOMETHING for the bitcoins you seek. There are PLENTY of people that are ready and willing to use your services and pay you in bitcoin. There are PLENTY of people who were early adopters who are sitting on millions of dollars and no way to spend them or take them all out of the system at once without losing ALL the profit on the way down as they crash the market down to a low price by selling off like that.
All I'm saying is, don't be greedy, don't look for handouts in the bitcoin world. You will get a lot of them, because most of the people in bitcoin are still geeks and nerdy types. Even if it's just the geeky wall street trader schmuck, it's still mostly techier types of them and we are a generous folk, but we have a limit on our generosity after being burned too many times by greedy people. (AKA, the SUPER greedy 1% at the top of the fiat system and the ones who follow in their footsteps)
EDIT: Also, people have ALWAYS wanted them for free, but you get my point.

In the past week, you've been enabled to buy Amazon gift cards, the pizzaforcoins site is now offering THREE companies to choose from, we have a tech site competing with Newegg and TigerDirect with NO markup on their products AND we have bitspend yesterday that can't even keep up with their orders. YES, $100M of value has probably been added. I'd say bitspend has a hell of a percentage of that over the next 6 months. Also, the gambling has gone pretty well mainstream as far as I can tell. Silkroad is going to become the percentage of the bitcoin economy that drug dealers are in the cash economy. All Bitcoin is is a mirroring of the "REAL WORLD" minus the crappy government telling you what is and isn't right. People inherently want to be left alone, Bitcoin lets you be left alone. It only makes sense that it becomes a HUGE thing over a short amount of time. It's no more unique than Facebook growing the way it did.

You just have to be patient. It will go back up. You can't panic and sell because it went down right after you bought. Look at the 30-day chart on bitcoinity. You'll see that dips always are followed by rises. I don't think it's going to quit purely based on how many people think it'll be a million dollars one day. I think when 51% believe bitcoin can make it to a million dollars per coin, it will happen, it would HAVE to happen based purely on mathematical statistics because when 51% believe it to be worth $1M, they will keep buying on every dip until they ARE sitting on $1M coins.

This is what I was wondering? What if a local economy decided to just boycott the dollar? Would that entire society thereby sidestep taxes and the IRS altogether? LEGALLY? I mean, last I checked, if I wanted to trade a stick for a meal, you can't really tax that, the reason being, you can't put an arbitrary value on items when bartering. A working car worth $500 USD that will get a CEO to his meeting in 25 minutes might be worth his rolex if he can't get a cab or something. This is an extreme example, I'm just saying, how do you monetize bitcoin if it's never traded back to USD and the value against the dollar is ignored? What if you decided within your community ever bitcoin is worth $200 and then divvied up the coins accordingly for transactions? I don't see how they can interfere with this system, and I'm pretty sure this is the entire intention behind bitcoin is to get rid of the Federal Reserve and their crooked practices of charging the United States government interest on the money they could print at ZERO interest if they weren't contracting it through a quasi-private-public company called the Federal Reserve.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:29:47
So it's basically an "escrow" for Bitcoin transactions.
Party A Deposits USD into the exchange ("escrow")
Exchange matches parties.
Exchange takes bitcoin from person B with bitcoin to sell.
Exchange takes percentage of the escrow amount from person A.
Exchange assigns deposit minus exchange amount worth of Bitcoin to person A.
I thought the exchange held BTC at all times and was facilitating the entire transaction to buyers. That's what CoinBase does...

It's a CURRENCY. How is the world ever going to adopt bitcoin if it's not value high enough to facilitate commerce WORLDWIDE? I don't understand why so many naysayers don't want to let bitcoin hit some phenomenal amount. 
Just because a lot of people bought in early and get rich, that doesn't mean that they don't deserve to get RICHER. I feel like there is so much greed around Bitcoin now that it's going to fail just over the asshats that won't recognize the value.
Everyone saying that bitcoin can't have a trillion dollar valuation is also saying that APPLE INC. is worth more than a CURRENCY that gets us out of the hands of the central bankers. People would rather think of it as an asset, and there lies the entire problem. It's NOT an asset, it's a way to facilitate trade without political bias. SMH. I'm starting to hate this place. &amp; don't bother telling me the door is open and I can leave, I'd rather stay and bitch and HOPEFULLY get SOMEONE to see the light that this form of currency could save our entire RACE.
We're all doomed when the sun explodes. Nobody has the cash or means to make space travel a reality to the average Joe. We have governments that won't even let us travel into space if for no other reason, than just the simple fact the people ready to do something greater than themselves, don't have the capital to do so. It's ridiculous. Humans have reached an all time low in my book.
Also on the 2 trillion dollar note. Why the hell do you think the USD is worth trillions? It's nothing more than a worthless piece of cotton with some ink stuck on it. People just blow my mind. Seriously.

Third-world countries would no longer be third world countries. Simply give them a computer loaded with the couple terrabytes or more of information. Forget pictures for them at this point. Let them become intelligent enough to build their own infrastructure. If ancient egyptians could build structure from the Earth with nothing, if you give a third world country the information we have. Divide up the "sages" of the groups in Africa to learn different aspects of "modern civilization" and let them hop on board. The ones who don't want to, can continue to live on their terms, until they decide to come on board, nobody should ever be forced to do anything against their will. If they like the simple life, let them live it. Personally, I'd love to live in a famished nation for a week or month to see just what it's like. From everything I've heard, a lot of third world countries laugh and smile more than their US citizen counterparts. It's no wonder with all the regulation we have upon us. We may be more intelligent than the third world countrymen, but we have let that go to our head, and now we think (we meaning the elite of us all) we can rule over them like they are cattle. It's time they get educated and stand up against us "smart people" and show their better ideas. We need a society that would have let Tesla's free energy progress and become the standard. I hate that people think people have to work so hard to make a living. I fix computers for a living, what's to tell me I shouldn't be able to go fix someone's computer for a couple BTC then go home for the rest of the day and relax. Hell, maybe since I'm raking in the dough, I'll be nice and share with my commenters if I were able to get rich fixing computers. Being a business owner of 6 years, I can tell you right now, less people have money than need computers fixed. I could be a millionaire doing my job if there were actually more currency in circulation to get to me. People let computers sit broken for weeks or months waiting on a paycheck to get it fixed. We need to get away from that way of thinking and get into a better way of thinking and be more generous to each other and trust each other more. Our current system promotes greed and stealing, the opposite system could only promote trust and giving.

Bitcoin isn't going to collapse with the dollar, but it's not being made clear enough that bitcoin is STANDALONE currency. Everyone thinks it's just a way to have more dollars in a smaller unit. It's not at all. When the mass consciousness shifts to see a car in bitcoin or their gasoline in bitcoin or their groceries in bitcoin, THEN and only then will Bitcoin be easy to receive and spend. Until then, count on working for them or exchanging locally. I highly recommend  to do a cash transaction face-to-face.

Cash Deposit via bitinstant on your Blockchain.info wallet would be your best bet. You just print out a paper from your blockchain wallet (it redirects you to BitInstant), walk into your local Wal Mart with the exact amount of cash they have printed on your sheet, fill out a moneygram order, and you have your bitcoins before you walk out of the store.

Yeah, after you so kindly mentioned it, I did go over there and ask for them. It's still irrelevant. I wasn't begging here and my post had EVERYTHING to do with BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:00:37
It's a simple spam filter, from what I understand. The XRP have no real value and aren't supposed to be traded as currency, that's what BTC is for? 
Also, with 10 billion ripples wouldn't the exchange rate always stay exactly the same so that it doesn't really matter who has them? Is there even a way to short the XRP without the BTC having to be shorted first? I don't fully understand, so if I'm wrong completely, I'd love to know.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:44:04
Thanks for the explanation in detail! Makes perfect sense.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:29:13
No doubt. Oh well. The believers have been outnumbered by the greedy Wall Street types in Bitcoin, obviously. Sad. Everyone just wants to make a quick buck. What a sad sad society we live in.

Going to watch the video and may edit this response. I can say right now, though, deflation's worst enemy is hoarders. The reason that doesn't matter is because we don't NEED to live in a consumerist society. It's only beneficial to the 1% at the top. It doesn't help anybody else.
If people want to save, that shouldn't be looked at as a problem. We need to INCENTIVIZE saving, and bitcoin does that. :) Just my 2 satoshis.

I've wondered the same...
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:37:31
Also, weren't we told that the fluctuations would become greater and greater as the value increased? That makes sense. Seeing as a 50% correction from $0.01 is $0.005 is a lot "smaller" crash, than $275 to $137.50. Don't worry about it. It's not going anywhere. Bitcoin is the resistance currency, the currency of the 99%...
I'm pretty sure I read ALL OVER Reddit a week or so ago that the price corrections would become more and more drastic and allow more and more people to profit buying low and selling high. This has already been predicted. Why freak out? The price is STILL UP $45 over just 3 days ago. People don't look at the right metrics and then freak out and make the corrections that much worse.
One day, people are going to realize they need to look at a 3day or 1week chart and it's not even a big deal. All the people trying to just make money, are STILL making money. Sheesh.
Speculator: If it's not increasing 500% in a day day after day I'm going to get out.
Believer: Oh well, it's just a correction, people will realize they sold off at a stupid time and I'll have that much more when it reaches it's mean of growth again. 
And by the way, I'm a believer, I've already spent my investment in purchasing hard assets. It doesn't matter what it does. I have no reason to speculate or CARE if it goes down. I have NEGATIVE USDs invested at this time and have physical products I've bought to show for it all. People need to use bitcoin like this and these corrections would quit going on so drastically.

AMAZING. So inspirational to show people who naysay bitcoin just out of ignorance and fear from that ignorance. "it's just a digial coin, you can't hold it" Well, DAD, those 50 or so homeless people got their belly full, thanks.

+1 on this. Mt Flop, you suck. Thank you for finally showing us that we shouldn't use you as our exchange. :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:29:03
+1 for clothing! I would love to buy clothing with it as well. I think we need to work on getting the "essentials" taken care of. I'm working on a "LOCALLY BITCOIN" campaign and want to get a coffee shop onboard with me first, then I have a gas station I'd like to get on board.
The only thing that concerns me is the negativity I've been fed about the price "crashing" and this and that. The only thing giving this thing ANY momentum whatsoever is the faith that it will continue to rise or at least hold value for the most part. I don't see how it could go down because BILLIONS of USD are being printed every month by the Fed. The rampant inflation problems of the USD only serve to prop the bitcoin up. It's going to reach a point where it's going up, but it's not really changing, it's only the fact that the dollar is collapsing.
Very few newbies seem to understand fractional reserve banking and how hyperinflation is about to kill the dollar. There is no going back for Bernanke. He may as well start throwing money out of helicopters it's going to become so worthless over the next few years.

Biggest question even after all that I just thought of, doesn't the bitcoin protocol allow apps to be built to generate a new address? Bitaddress.com does just that, correct?
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:41:03
Lol not that kind of glassware, although I've thrown around the idea of a bitcoin headshop.

Great question, my friend. I don't know the answer to this one. I'd like to think we could set up a p2p mesh network with wireless if we could get enough people to participate.
Then possibly tunnel the traffic over another decentralized network "pocket." Basically, I'm thinking something like exit nodes be used as in TOR in major cities and even small towns. They would all have ways out to the internet, but they would all be interconnected and "off the internet." Perhaps a whole new "TOR NETWORK" could be used ONLY for people in this system with access to a minimum 200Mbps connection. (easily done with ubiquity wireless equipment ( that is tried and true)
Like I said, I'm unsure how we can do it. But it is the answer to the control problems we have, IMHO. More bandwidth allows for greater things to happen. To break it down into it's simplest terms, if it's good for pornography, it's good for the world. Trust me. People will spend more money developing a way to have sex with a realistic hologram than they will spend on developing a way to exchange "nerdy" money. Personally, I'd rather have my girlfriend and my nerdy money, but you get where I'm going. Pornography is what took us from exchanging pictures on Usenet to serving up LIVE HD webcams of gorgeous people. If we have enough bandwidth for what some would call smut, I think we need enough bandwidth to push through productive technologies like Bitcoin and other P2P systems.
Obviously, the government has EVERY incentive to discourage P2P, because they can't tax that which they cannot put a UPC (social security number) upon.
TLDR: Anonymity trumps government interference. So we really need a way to get around their interference on groundbreaking technologies. Especially with bitcoin, people shouldn't have to "worry" about tax repercussions. I pay my taxes, but I bitch and cuss the whole time I'm doing it.

You can always check the public key ( the qr code) to see the balance and top up and add more funds later. Once you see the balance is correct in your paper wallet, put it in your safe or some place for safe keeping. You won't lose anything if you verify the amount in the paper wallet by scanning the qr code with a balance checker app. I have one on my iPhone. Coinbits, I believe.
Edit: it's called scanbook on iOS

GREAT NEWS, INDEED! :) So happy to see this working out. I've been hurt by the fraction reserve monetary system since I was a child. It's stifled so many of my creative ideas because no money is ever available to fund the ideas I have. I'm hoping my bitcoins will one day release me of the chains money imposes on me and I'll be able to make my ideas a reality.

Define: Greed. :)
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:28:59
I have never seen anything like this, but I'm not pulling out now. I'm in it till 1 million or $0. I was just about to buy something on bitcoinstore but now I'm hesitant, but I'm not about to sell my coin and I'd buy more if I had some disposable income.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:25:10
But they can't get all the money they think they have "made." That's what they want. So you're saying we have to get people away from being greedy. And we have to get them to accept that you can't pull out other people's money from the system because you're a greedy fuck and bought in early. I don't see how you could convince humans to ignore their nature for accumulating wealth to keep themselves financially safe.
Because if people keep pulling the money out, they are going to crash Bitcoin when it gets to the point everyone has sucked out all that's even invested into the whole system. Hell, that brings me to the question:
"How much USD has actually been deposited into Exchanges vs How many bitcoins have been sold?" 
That is an awesome question. It shows the discrepancy between the valuation we have and actual LIQUID value of the whole market, right? I guess you can't even do that because you have to consider the Chinese deposits and everyone else's. Damn. I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around Bitcoin. Satoshi, whoever you are, you're a damn hero and genius. I think Bitcoin is alien code. LOL Kidding. :)
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:51:43
I post this post and it jumps to 139.60. I'm taking the credit. LOL Just kidding. Hope this will help newbies understand that they aren't losing just because they buy at $140 and then this drop happened. It'll be $150 by the end of the week judging by past performance. :)

Agreed 100% we need to start a campaign to get newbies to acknowledge the BENEFITS of bitcoin, not the value against a collapsing fiat. We are no better than them if we keep worrying about what the USD is doing vs the bitcoin.
 We need to all collectively FIND a balance point and then cut ties with the dollar and let the dollar be measured in BTC. 1USD=1000BTC, for example. NOT 1BTC=x amount of USD.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:17:10
Yes, she's ready for that to happen. :) BitPay will probably be in her immediate future, however.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:26:59
I've already spent DOUBLE what I invested into my original ones, so I can't lose. I really hope it doesn't fall, though. I hate all the negativity around here today after this craziness. We have to keep our faith in our Bitcoins! Faith is what drives the price up, not what they are "really worth" against the dollar or anything. People want them to be worth $500/coin, people will make it happen by slowly buying higher and higher because that in itself pushes the price up. We could have kept buying at $1 if that's all we believed they were worth, but there was that person (or people) that believed they were $2, then $4, then $8, then $50, now $115. I still believe they are worth $1,000,000. It's the only way to make them support the world economy if that's our ultimate goal with them.

The money problem will not solve the dependence on drugs, the fact that people are being born with mental issues. We need to use this newfound wealth to boycott the corporations that are killing the planet. We need to use this money to fund main street and steal from wall street. Once we go back to people loving their neighbors and being able to go fill their tank up on an I.O.U. from the gas station owner because his son plays baseball with your son... THAT is when we will all be liberated and the shackles removed.
