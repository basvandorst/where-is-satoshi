Isn’t that exactly why governments started in the first place? Humans collect into tribes or gangs to prevent being murdered. It grows from there.

I'm not sure you posted this on the right comment. But here you go: 
Humans are pack/tribal animals, there will always be government. Abolishing one only replaces it with another. There are always leaders, and always followers.  You seem to think there's some inherent malice in it, there is not.  The violence issue is the species, not the institution.

Then that would become government.

Philosophers and intellectuals are rarely the leading type. People, being pack animals need to be led. They also compete with other packs, so there's a required amount of violence required to prevent other packs from overtaking yours, so often the leaders tend to be the best at violence or prevention by threat of such.. but again this is a result of the species being outwardly aggressive pack animals, not of concepts of government in general.

They'll all be worth 0 to the roving bands of raiders after the collapse.  I mean, would you like to buy my imaginary assets?

I have never heard somebody call it BCash in person. It's also not piggy-backing, it's a fork. I bitched too when it was happening.. and I've wised up when i realized it worked... unlike bitcoin in its current state.

There's a who bin called "who gives a fuck" that this thread and whole naming debate belong in.

How do you think them having money supports a price point?  Do you think they’re seriously dumping tons of money to prop it up?!   
I mean, seriously, guys. You can’t buy antminers with bitcoin, you need bitcoin cash. The largest pool/asic maker doesn’t trust bitcoin for its own use. They recently only accept bitcoin cash. That in and of itself drives serious demand for the coin. It works, it’s fast, it’s a functional transaction. I don’t care to invest in it but I’m buying and using it because I can complete transactions with it

Wasn't that what people were predicting in august?

No.. No, they did not. The way humans rewrite history in their heads to fit their narrative is a fascinating field of study, though.

Man, do you get confused with US dollars and Australian dollars?  How about sand dollars? Silver dollars?  Silver Dollar City? 6 Million Dollar Man?
