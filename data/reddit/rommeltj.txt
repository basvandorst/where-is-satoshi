Slightly unrelated but so true. When I introduced Git to our developers they refused to accept it because they didn't understand it and couldn't comprehend its benefits. To them VCS would always be better despite them never trying Git. 
What I'm getting at is that the decentralized concept is incredibly hard for some people to accept. In my office, my co-workers would not have learned it naturally unless my Director made everyone learn it. Bitcoin is the same and it's up to app developers to make people use Bitcoin so they can understand it. Only then can they make a decision that is not driven by fear or ignorance or both.

Bitcoin works because everyone and everything agrees it works, from the users to the pieces of software. And yet nobody trusts any other. Then how does everyone agree it works? Because the only thing that is pure and unbiased in the universe is Math and Bitcoin is based on very sophisticated algorithms. In an amazing piece of social engineering, Satoshi Nakamoto designed the system so that there are incentives to run it and follow the rules. 
From there it is easy to make the leap on how societies based on cryptography will be more trusting, and thus more likely to come to decisions as a group and accept the conclusion.
@_date: 2014-08-23 02:57:56
Very easy. I use the electrum wallet and you can do it with one or two clicks.
Legal. You just need to follow proper accounting procedures and report it to the government. 
It would take more in time and fees, but it's worth it and still better than the alternatives depending on how many transactions you do.

I don't like the answers that you're getting. Imo, the mathematical hash that is proof of work gives Bitcoin its value. It's proof that somebody spent the computational time to "mine" the Bitcoin and it's proof that you are the only owner of your Bitcoins and they cannot be replicated.

Bank of America checks were not free. First, they didn't give me some when I opened an account even though they should've. Second, ordering checks was going to be like $35 which I refused to pay (Money Orders are like $.25). Lastly, they wanted me to keep a balance above a certain level.

Saying BTC is a pyramid scheme is just as silly as saying the U.S. Dollar is a pyramid scheme. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Companies and people make pyramid scheme. BTC is not a company. It is a decentralized digital currency.
I invite you to make your educated argument here. I really want to know why you think BTC is stupid and why I'm a dumbass. 
And for the record, even at the lowest of the crash, I was only down 2%. Bitcoin continues to outperform all my other investments on a yearly basis (by a lot). Not that I invested in Bitcoin just to make money. I use it regularly and it's so much better than paying with credit cards.

I think you're being short-sighted. People don't want small amounts of Bitcoin because killer apps that leverage Bitcoin micropayments don't exist yet. But they will pop-up if it becomes profitable. And it can't become profitable if people can't acquire Bitcoin. So chicken-egg problem.

Alt-coins are more susceptible to attacks simply because they're smaller, thus they damage the reputation of other cryptocurrencies. I agree with you that "there's no reason there can't be a rich and diverse universe of coins", but developers and users should be very careful when working with them.
I'm a developer and I think of it like implementing your own security algorithms. You may think you know what you're doing, but unless you are an expert and at the top of your field you will end up like Mark Karpeles. 
There is always someone smarter or someone with more money and power that wants to bring you down, but if we all back the same Cryptocurrency we all become more resilient.
And at the end of the day, you can still brand your site/app however you want and call it FitCoin or whatever but still use Bitcoin to power everything. It's just another layer of abstraction. Unless your coin has a feature that Bitcoin can't have, there's no reason to not use Bitcoin. My two cents.

I haven't seen many merchants that sell things I want. There is that gift card service that I find inconvenient and that service that makes Amazon purchases on your behalf (why would I do that?). 
I bought something on Massdrop and it's been almost 30 days and I haven't received my item. I'm going to try local merchants in San Diego and see how it goes, but so far I haven't had much luck using my bitcoins. 
The first merchant to really take advantage of Bitcoin will make riches. Right now it feels like customers have to go out of our way to support merchants that use bitcoin. This isn't charity. Be creative and sell stuff that I want. 
For example, right now I need a new computer chair. I don't know where to buy it other than Amazon or a local furniture store. None of those accept Bitcoin.

Disclaimer: I only have cursory knowledge on the topic from college. Take what I say with a grain of salt.
I agree with you that greed is subjective and thus hard to quantify. However, there is this great paper "Financial news and market panics in the age of high-frequency sentiment trading algorithms" (and many more) that has shown that market news is asymmetric. In markets with high degree of uncertainty, like Bitcoin, investors are much more susceptible to "bad" news than "good" news. It is almost a fact that investors will overreact to bad news and underreact to good news. 
In the world of High Frequency Trading, you can have bots listening in to comments and determine with a certain degree of certainty if a bit of news is "framed" in a positive or negative light by counting the appearance of certain nouns or adjectives. It is not foolproof, but these algorithms are usually coupled with machine learning techniques and they can learn from their mistakes. This translates into instant buy orders deprived of emotional decisions. I have no idea if someone is doing this with Bitcoin, but it would seem likely given that it has a ton of geeks involved!
So to go back to your point, I don't know if you can quantify/measure "greed" in a philosophical sense, but you can certainly correlate certain terms with fluctuations in price and use this to your advantage.

Hmm, good point. I would guess it's because usually with your company, there are very few variables. Your salary is usually the same and the banks are the same. Very little changes so it must get expedited somehow.

Let's not panic. Most of us are not doing anything illegal. They can't legally seize your assets without a good reason, so I don't get why you would want to move your BTC out of a US based wallet service.
I will stick with US-based services to support the companies that are taking risks and providing legitimacy to Bitcoin.

Haha! Bitcoin is such a different beast. I made the mistake of comparing it to how a stock is valuated. With stocks, you are always wary of price floating too far away from company earnings, but Bitcoin behaves very strangely.

I managed to successfully explain it to both my mom (52) and my grandmother (81). When they asked me if they should invest, I told them I would not recommend a heavy investment at their stage in life. For me (24), it makes perfect sense. I don't have to worry about paying medical bills or retirement though. 
You don't have to complicate your explanation so much. They just need to know that it's a new virtual currency not tied to a government or a central bank and then explain with examples how Bitcoin wins over debit cards or credit cards. Bitcoin has so many advantages that it's easy to come up with a situation in their daily lives where it can improve things. The ones I used are instant peer-to-peer transfers even across countries and no wait times like wire transfers.

Really? If you demand a certain level of service go to a more mature, less speculative market. 
It is quite alright to demand better service. It is certainly within your right to complain.

So far I like it. I wish it worked without the voice command.  And I second the other guy's thoughts on the design. It's too "agressive" maybe? I don't know. I like Yahoo!'s and Google's stock charts, so maybe you can use those as inspiration. Overall though, it's fantastic! If you didn't change a thing I would probably be happy unless someone did something better.
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:29:20
The fact of the matter is that the [current 30-day estimated transaction value of the Bitcoin economy]( is about $156 Million dollars and the Bitcoin "Market cap" is over $4 Billion dollars. Very few people are spending their Bitcoins. Everybody is hoarding them like idiots and the price is not sustainable when there is a disconnect of over 2,500%. It's simply growing too fast.
I would be more comfortable if the price of Bitcoin were at around $25 USD.

I once bought Bitcoins at $160. They then went down to $120 and they stayed there for a while. At the time, I don't think Coinbase existed. I tried exiting from MtGox. Waited, waited, waited, and waited some more. Eventually I canceled the sell and moved to Coinbase. In that period, Bitcoin was way up, at like $400. So by shoddy service, MtGox saved me from a big loss, heh.
What I'm getting at is that nobody knows the true value of Bitcoin. Advice you get from people here is likely to be biased in their favor. However, historically if you held you will likely come out on top.

I seriously doubt you are the dumbest Canadian. :)
I would agree with you for the most part. I wrote a long comment a while back on why I thought a Bitcoin should only be worth around $25 USD. The fact is that people want the damn coins. If you sit there waiting to buy in at a price that you think is reasonable, you may be left out and that's the risk you have to factor in. 
I've bought coins at $60, $120, $250, $500 and now $800 and so far it hasn't turned out to be a bad investment, but I agree with you.

Well, the "end game" of the bitcoin protocol must be 100% adoption.

This is what I thought, but then again, the money on my savings account is sitting there earning 0.01%. Even if it makes 0.02%, it's already beating my current investment strategy and if I believe that Bitcoin is going much higher, then it is irrational to not invest in Bitcoin now if I don't have another good alternative. 
I'm not going to dump all my savings into Bitcoin, but at this point it feels "safe enough" to allocate a good chunk of my savings into Bitcoin as soon as possible before it becomes more mainstream.

That said, I can think of hundreds of applications that can ONLY work by verifying your identity. Loans, for example, would be much easier.  Credit worthiness is reliant upon verifying your identity. So on and so forth.

When you pay with a CC, the banks validate the transaction. With coinbase, it automatically deposits dollars into your bank account so you don't worry sbout price fluctuations. 
You definitely can do it without an intermediary, but it's going to be a costly proposition unless you are a programmer.

Well, in general I am not a big spender so I don't spend my dollars either. It's what happens after you graduate college abd realize you are a slave to college debt.

I am so lucky to be in a city that is slowly embracing Bitcoins. Little by little, I am spending less dollars and more Bitcoins. These last few weeks have been incredible in the number of merchants accepting Bitcoins.
At this rate, all I need to do is get my landlady to accept Bitcoin, local utilities to take Bitcoin, get a gas station and mechanic that takes Bitcoin, and I'm set. I can already buy food with Bitcoin (local merchant and Gyft sells Whole Foods cards!). Although I wish I had more selection, at the rate we are going it's not going to take long!

Ah, where were you a month ago when I opened a thread looking for a vacation destination that accepted Bitcoin. Next year!

Wait, why not?

I pledge to buy all my electronics from Newegg instead of Amazon if they take Bitcoin. I am currently shopping for an external drive.
@_date: 2013-10-09 16:17:58
Yes, this is the main reason for me as well. I work in the USA and have family in Mexico. I also travel to different countries all the time. Granted, I don't rely on Bitcoin since its value changes all the time, but this is why I was attracted to it and I'm waiting for it to mature so I can use it more effectively.
At the moment, I have to rely on Bank Of America but I hate them with a passion only surpassed by my hate for Paypal. I'm speculating that Bitcoin can replace them.

It'd be hilarious if you were actually George Clooney or a Bitcoin. Silly camera, leave the reddit comments to humans.

That's genius! That way it has [intrinsic]( [value](

I'm glad I'm not the only one.

Hahaha, I love coming to this subreddit. You guys crack me up.

The price of a single BitCoin is out of touch with the BitCoin economy, which means that the vast majority of the price comes from speculation. Luckily, there are a lot of small to medium businesses that are starting to take Bitcoin and generating good press, but I wonder what's going to cause it to come crashing down or if the Bitcoin killer app that we are expecting will come first to save us all.
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:14:04
I keep trying to buy BitCoins and Coinbase keeps rejecting my orders! Does anybody know a reliable service that will fulfill my order? I feel like I lost so much money because of this.
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:58:39
Does the text change with the value of Bitcoin or does it always say the same thing?
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:18:14
Whoah! TIL! I will be researching this later. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:50:48
I don't understand. You are investing in companies not the dollar. If the dollar fails, it doesn't mean companies won't adjust.

If you use it, you are also less likely to run into tax issues.

No, I got that. You still blew my mind with BTC-Jam. And I knew about Lending Club, but I didn't know about Bitcoin Lending Club: bitlendingclub.com/how-it-works/bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:39:58
Which begs the question of what do you think they should be focused on? I haven't heard anything from them since they elected that girl...
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:46:08
Love it! Good job.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:22:41
It's ok. Get your cash back then buy more Bitcoins in January.

What are you going to be auto-moderating? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:09:02
I've been part of this subreddit for a while. It didn't use to be like this but for some reason the mods think the community can moderate itself and as it grew in subscribers the quality decreased almost as dramatically as the price of Bitcoin rose. I agree with you that most posts are giant circlejerks. However, because it is the largest subreddit for Bitcoin, it is hard to unsubscribe because every now and then there is genuinely good content or a good Bitcoin merchant deal. In my opinion, they need to ban text-only posts and memes, but most disagree so it is what it is.
Check out the more specialized subreddits on the sidebar. They are much better.

"Be fearful when others are greedy unless they post the spartan meme." 
No wait... That's incorrect too.

Bitcoin solves real problems for me that alternatives like wire transfers or Paypal cannot. It also gets me excited because it fits very nicely with my political ideologies. This may not fit your case. Bitcoin will not replace the dollar or the euro.
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:04:05
I think a small dip to 700 is at least probable from people that got scared from the crash and haven't sold yet followed by a quick rebound. Not based on anything. Just my gut.
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:48:45
I edited my post above with the receipt I got. I am not sure if I can use that for tax purposes, to be honest. It doesn't seem to have any identifiable information.

Meh. What I was getting at is that the FDIC is funded by bank investments and they pass the buck to the consumer in the form of lower interest rates. It's not free lunch.

Sadly, my landlord doesn't accept Bitcoin and it's currently inconvenient for my relatives to use localbitcoin. 
This will change. :) If I had a lot of money, I would have already set up local exchanges in Mexico, India, etc. and completely displaced these businesses. If Western Union does it first, then they will probably keep my business.

Meh. It's not really news. It's an endorsement. Be wary of investing on this type of "news" as it doesn't really raise the value of the network.

It says that they reach their limit for the day and to try again tomorrow. I searched this sub and it seems like I'm not the only one, but I read comments like these and it feels like everyone is buying with no issues.

Thanks for sharing. Looking forward to it.

Yep. I am more confident than ever. Every time the price drops more than 10% I'm buying.

Yes, just report it and stop giving them attention. 
Mods will surely place warnings in a visible location.

This is exactly what I'm talking about. I wish the mods can generate discussion threads kind of like the ones in other subreddits. For example,

To play devil's advocate, if your customers view Bitcoin as a scam you don't want to associate your business with it.

Haha, I am hardly rich! I got in at $60 but I never said with how much or that I haven't made mistakes along the way. Trust me. There was a big learning curve, which is why I'm laughing now. It's like watching past me.

If it crashes to &lt;$500, it will be media frenzy.

Ohhh, this is an interesting theory. To someone who didn't know about Bitcoin Black Friday (Asians/Europeans?) and was only looking at the charts all the sudden sells would look incredibly suspect, wouldn't it?

Did you yell "It's over 9,000?" when it happened? Because that's what I would've done. 
In all seriousness, that's a shit-ton of emails. I freak out when I get 300 emails/day at my job.
