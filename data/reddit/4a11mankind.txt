Just linked this to my fraternity. So far we've made $40 easy dollars. I offered each of them $5 for the coins they get if they don't want to hold them ;)

He never specifies 1% of the U.S. tax haven accounts. Perhaps he's referencing a global 1%

Idk about that, but all I can say is that if you buy today and sell in 1 year, you are probably gona make more than just a couple of bucks.

I bought one of these with bitcoin back in 2011 for around 3.5BTC...

At least you didn't pay $1.9K for a razor mouse, a micro cube (magnets), and a mouse pad...

Bought a few months before the $30 spike. Believe it or don't, but I actually bought a razor mouse, a micro cube, and a mouse pad for 
10 BTC
@_date: 2013-10-27 22:53:28
yeah, I'd say my currently valued $700 magnetic balls were worth buying ;)
