Put enough money on an exchange and buy a coin

Yeah it’s a great new show. Unfortunately it won’t last because people on the show keep having to leave due to being stabbed.

I was thinking of doing the same but I doubt they’d be appreciated as much as I’d like. You’re forcing people to now learn about bitcoin and set up wallets in order to get the money you just gave them.
Yeah it’s thoughtful, but making people work to get your gift probably won’t go to well.

I use QuadrigaX and Ezbtc.ca
I like ezbtc because I can send them an e-transfer from my bank (costs $1) to fund, only takes a few hours to see the money in the account. It’s nice for buying dips.
When prices rise quick ezbtc prices are often lower than quad because they have less volume, so price changes a lot slower. This means their prices are usually higher than quad, though.

I’m completely assuming here, but I doubt the people who watch the Big Bang theory also watch the shows revolving around bitcoin/crypto.

Begging/asking for bitcoins isn't allowed.

You must be so smart having heard of bitcoin earlier.
