We'll be in uncharted territory with micro payments that makes Visa tx rates way less than adequate.  We need a system that scales linearly with the combined processing power.

This might be a silly question, but why would the bandwidth requirements change if changing the block size does not mean more actual transactions?  In other words, if the transaction rate was the same, why would packaging those transactions in more or less blocks have such an enormous impact on bandwidth?
@_date: 2015-06-05 00:33:37
But where I'm confused about your point is that there is still just 2 bitcoins.  The bank could continue to play musical chairs and simulate a greater supply of bitcoins, but if the music were to stop (bank decides to close down shop), they could not be paid what they are owed.

I think the fuel feeding the long running debate is the fact that you really can't ELI5 much about the block size debate. It's a complicated debate that seems to mostly be conjecture based and not approached in an analytical way.

There is a point.  A decentralized market for legal transactions to displace eBay, Alibaba, etc.  Pure anonymity is not necessary for this.   Having that in place ASAP is more important than having anonymity, imho.

It's not that information that doesn't fit my world view is being thrown out, it's that there is nothing compelling to suggest that these states of altered consciousness are more than the result of electrochemical variations in your brain.  I have personally experienced the radical change in perception that can come from many sources (chemical, trauma, spiritual, religious, near death, etc.), many times.  Those experiences have only strengthened my belief that although they seemed to be an opening into another plane of existence, they were merely the perception of my conscious brain affected by signalling and processing disruption.  
Some day we will probably have a much more complete understanding of the mystical experience, but there's already enough to suggest that yet another subject believed to be beyond the rational mind does actually fall within natures purview. 
Here's a quick clip that partially explains my main point, which is..
As incredible and reality checking as mystical experiences are for the experiencer , it's still an experience produced within the brain and not evidence of contact with an external realm, intelligence, or entity.

What I don't understand is how these 'Bitcoin Kids' can mitigate crypto-currency's greatest existential threat - becoming illegal throughout the world. It seems like if the potential of bitcoin was realized on even a fraction of the scale possible, it would get swatted down with a vengeance by the money monopolies.

Lol, I just realized I was asking about the wrong guy.  I was thinking he was the guy that posts to buttcoin subreddit.
@_date: 2014-08-30 00:30:57
What I don't get is why I'd be downvoted for asking a question?  Anyway, it doesn't seem like it would be that hard. If it was made illegal, it would be much harder to exchange for any traditional currency. It would also likely make a lot of the retailers that are starting to accept bitcoin change course.  I don't get the comparison to the war on drugs either (not your response). If the means to exchange bitcoin into say USD was cuttoff similarly to how payment processors cutoff Wikileaks in the past, not sure it could recover from that.
@_date: 2014-09-11 00:33:49
Without blasting me, could someone explain why services like Coinbase receive such adoration when they seem to be just another 'control point' on the transfer of bitcoins?  Putting a daily limit on how much I can buy or sell seems antithetical to what bitcoin means to me.  What other means of control do they reserve the right to?
*Edit.  Great answers, thanks!  It seems many view the traditional -&gt; digital currency exchange as just a stepping stone to full bitcoin adoption.

You're probably right.  To participate on SecondMarket you have to be an 'accredited investor', I believe.  In order to have the opportunity to make money on things like this, you have to prove that you are already rich.

I don't think that digital has any relation to fingers or base 10 when used in the computer sense.  And if anything, binary not base 10.
That's why I say that for intents and purposes, calling it a digital currency or virtual currency has the same meaning.

And if you buy this way you immediately lose value due to the crazy price markup.  As of right now, it's listed at $508 through the service you posted about when BTC is trading at $388.
Why would someone want to do this?

I can tell you have it all figured out.  Care to explain why you think bitcoin is a scam?
@_date: 2014-09-23 23:31:01
I'm a bit skeptical.  PayPal made a deal with Coinbase so that merchants won't have to deal with Bitcoin at all- it's immediately converted to fiat when a purchase is made.  I doubt many merchants will be willing to accept the price volatility of holding on to the Bitcoins themselves. I'm also willing to bet that PayPal will try to prevent merchants from using Bitcoin directly or via Coinbase, etc.  In a sense, I think this move is to eliminate the threat that Bitcoin poses to other payment processors by owning the merchants' ability to use it directly.

Trezor needs to make a combo android wear watch/ offline signing device.  I'm not saying have trezor run on android, just combine both functions into a single wearable device.  Boom!
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:36:21
Yeah, it would definitely be more expensive.  But I think as soon hardware wallets are to become common (if that is), it will become obvious that carrying around another single purpose device sucks.  Smart watches seem to be close to mass market adoption, so the opportunity to have it server this purpose seems like a good one.  I'd pay $100 on top of the cost of the average smart watch if it meant a secure way to do mobile payments. Kickstart that b**ch!

Since minimal transaction fees are the attraction for many people to bitcoin, will it still make sense if PayPal is in the loop?  My guess is they'll accept bitcoin, but still charge their normal transaction fees.

It could also show that this debate has been beaten to death for months now. The same points are made and countered from both sides, over and over.  I think people in each camp are just tired of debating and are sticking with whichever side of the debate they landed on.

While I appreciate your explanation, it's far from that simple. Each person that frequently contributes to the debate and many more have made many arguments in support of their positions all over reddit and other places. Each point a person makes could have a counter point.  There are criticisms against various BIPS that have been proposed as well.  My point is that within this debate, a lot of detail is either getting rehashed over and over, or lost in the clutter altogether. There has also been many allegations of personal and professional agendas that is hard to follow.  It strikes me that the whole debate and future challenges to consensus could be better managed than the current method.

The only counter balance to all attempted price manipulation is the pace of innovation.  The worldwide rush to capitalize on bitcoin will be death by 1000 cuts to incumbents trying to suppress it and/or manipulate it on a massive scale.

Is it even legal in the US to sell bitcoins for cash?  I'm in California if there's state level specificity.  I had heard that if you sell bitcoin, you need to be licensed as a money transmitter.

If that was the only approach taken to develop new products, only big companies with deep pockets would ever produce.  A small company (i.e. 3 dudes with an idea) needs to sell the vision of their software road map early on to attract investment, talent, and build market awareness.  It's not easy.

There's no detail on what the service is that I'd be signing up for.  Why would I do that?
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:53:56
Good advice. I just read up on it and there's a bill in California that goes into affect in 2016 if approved by the state legislature and signed by the governor.  It has been amended to require a $500 application fee (reduced from $5000), and is required for anyone exchanging fiat for crypto or even crypto for other crypto.  I'm no lawyer, but would infer that until then it's ok.
@_date: 2015-07-14 02:58:06
By hard I assume you mean "costs a ton of money in licensing and lawyers".
@_date: 2016-02-14 20:21:41
It seems that the 21 solution is no different than say Coinbase allowing customers to send offchain payments to each other.  Anyone can be a centralized solution to transfer value between centralized accounts. Users just cash out from the centralized service to bitcoins and you have the same thing as 21.co.

@_date: 2015-09-19 04:28:12
I don't think you get what I'm saying.  You're right, if it's under a single company's control, they could change it so what's the point of having a blockchain when a database will do just fine. There is no point in that scenario. But if it's decentralized to a private group of member banks, each bank would have incentive run their own nodes to ensure the other banks are on the up n up. So they're putting in resources to secure the blockchain for themselves, not the other member banks in this private consortium.
@_date: 2015-09-18 19:12:08
Making bitcoin payments for internet access anywhere in the world. Completely autonomous and pseudonymous.  Seems like a really good example of a DAC talked about in Etherium and Bitcoin 2.0 circles, and one with truly global impact.

Agreed.  Anyone building a bitcoin related business that isn't going out of their way to secure client funds is suspect in my mind.

Very well put, thank you.
@_date: 2015-09-18 19:27:24
They're finally catching on to the one angle where a private blockchain can work.  In a consortium of banks, there exists enough incentive for member banks to apply enough computing power to secure a blockchain.  It would be private and permissioned, but secure enough for their purposes.  I also wonder what can be accomplished by a group of competent developers that aren't arguing about blocksize forever.
@_date: 2015-04-10 02:09:53
Exactly.  It does absolutely nothing to reduce traffic going through the big bad ISPs.  I can't remember what it was called, but there was something like this broadband sharing way back in 2005 or 2006.  The only different now is they throw around the 'mesh network' buzzword.

How is it clear?  It seems fishy as fuck to me.  He allegedgly paid for the hit with an $80k wire transfer when he's accused of running a bitcoin based empire?

You don't think he would have thought of that if he was indeed paying to have someone killed?
@_date: 2015-09-12 00:20:49
I don't think your comment has anything to do with my post.  I'm talking about the effect of spending bitcoin in a retail setting being practically equivalent to selling the bitcoin for fiat on an exchange.  People could exchange bitcoin for goods and services, without conversion to fiat.  That would have quite a different affect on price stability.

I don't get why some people see larger blocks as mutually exclusive to other scaling solutions. It's going to take many new innovations in the architecture for many years to come for it to scale to truly global levels. LN is not the end all of scaling either.  Personally, I think the sharding approach that was presented at the last scaling conference is the most promising.  I also think that it's the most obvious solution to scaling of any large system, but very difficult in this context due to the game theory balance that bitcoin currently offers.

Clearly the statements of a close minded person.  Can you not see the hundreds of millions of dollars in investment capital flocking to those who are envisioning the next step in it's evolution? A  Blockchain doesn't exist without a token of value, bitcoin just happens to be the most widely adopted token.  So your concept of a distributed ledger only means anything with a token like bitcoin, or it's simply a project doomed to fail when database technology is far superior when trust of all participants is required.
@_date: 2015-10-14 17:58:24
