That's not a pun, that's racism.

Instead we pay our staff a fair wage so they don't have to scrounge for tips... but you were saying?

What would be awesome is if I could just go to a nice restaurant, have a good meal and then at the end just "excuse me, could i pay with bitcoin", "certainly sir"....
It would 1) save me having to use cards and getting hit with them sorts of fees for overseas use and exhange rates and 2) just make it seem more real to the missus!

See you got downvoted for a fair comment, does seem strange, perhaps its something to do with limiting the number of coins thrown out into circulation?
Sure somebody must know the answer...

Haha, thanks for the advice!
Would be great to try, just a shame I'm not going to Bangkok (went there a few years back before I even knew about bitcoin...)

So to me, still fairly new to Bitcoin it sounds like there isn't enough compute capacity on the network to process the current number of transactions?
Would it now make sense for an individual with a fairly powerful PC (i.e. myself) to start mining?

Your account begs to differ... HODL

Thanks, may i ask how much in mining fees do you pull in?

As it has been said many times, why would a Greek go and spend precious euros on something they can't widely use right now? Would be a bad decision for the majority of Greeks

Their UK site doesn't appear to accept bitcoin as a payment method.
@_date: 2015-07-07 12:54:42
I see I have a lot to learn still

Thanks for the advice, I think I'll check it out, especially the cardless ATM withdrawal, will have to read up on the fees to see if its cheaper than using my UK debit card to withdraw or not.
