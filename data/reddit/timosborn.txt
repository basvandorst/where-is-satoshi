When I This posted this I never said anything about getting rid of fiat or buying BTC all I said was we need an alternative.  YOU have perceived propaganda just because this is a bitcoin sub so who is drawing inferences from nowhere?  
One of the great things about bitcoin is it is AN alternative which is an OPT IN system.  You can enter and at your own leisure.  Unlike the current privatized, centralized fractional reserve system that you are forced into from birth.

wow, you're actually continuing the analogy, that's amazing!
Here's the difference.
Take for example the deutsche mark, the german national currency that millions of germans relied upon as the national currency.  The total maket cap of this currency would be very high.  People rely upon it to live, eat pay rent pay for electricity, everything!!  This currency suffered mass hyperinflation after WW2 so much that it was scrapped and replaced.
Find any crypto that compares with that.  Not even the best crypto, bitcoin carries the same importance to peoples daily lives as the deutsche mark so no you can't compare some little shitcoin that never even reached a 100m market cap that was never used for anything except speculation to the deutsche mark.

so, once upon a time, a "bank" used to hold your "money" but it wasn't real money, cause there was what we call a "debt" based system.  All of these debts were kept on centralised databases that sometimes failed and people couldn't access the paper money that represented the debts owing to them. And if more than 10&amp; of the bank's customers wanted to redeem their deposits the whole financial system would collapse.
Yes, children this is a real story, stop asking me that.

I keep copy pasting the same comment, why do people make this comparison?
comparing  irrelevant cryptos to fiat currency does not work as an analogy.  No  one relys on useless shitcoins, they are not legal tender and no one  cares if they die except a few speculators.  A fiat currency is legal  tender.  People rely upon it for everything, their health, well being  and their quality of life, food, education, everything!  If a fiat fails  it can wipe out your life savings, money for food, money for education,  fuel, everything gone into thin air.
So  it's a big deal if a fiat currency fails because its' legal tender that  affects people's lives.  Shitcoins affect very few people.  Your  grandmother doesn't need Verge to buy bread at the store but she needs  fiat currency to eat.

"Prior to the work of Satoshi Nakamoto, many of these assumptions would have been correct. However, in arguably one of the most significant technological inventions of all time, Satoshi Nakamoto solved the double spending problem for digital currencies, and launched a revolutionary new currency, Bitcoin. Bitcoin and its technology were immune to manipulation, hacking, and double spending. Since it was created in 2009, Bitcoin has grown from being worth roughly 5 cents per coin to being worth roughly $15,000 per coin in the beginning of 2018."

what's needed is more services where they can accept crypto and then automatically hedge the exchange risk back to fiat somehow.  Futures is one way for bitcoin but is not viable for smaller businesses.
Say if a car dealer was to sell a lambo for 50 BTC and the price was 10K.  He could take out a short contract to cover the difference is exchange risk if the price was to fall.  The bitcoin is worth less in USD but the profit from the short position would cover that.  Conversely, if the price went up this would cost in USD but the dealer gets a better rate USD/BTC.
For a cafe though, this is troublesome.  But I can see FX companies creating solutions for all kinds of companies big or small.   this is actually why bitcoin futures are important for mainstream adoption.

A business does not receive the money from a visa or mastercard transaction into their account as soon a the transaction goes through and is 'authorised'.  Most of these transactions go through by the next day but like you said can be reversed by the bank if they are found to be fraudulent.  
My point is that Visa and Mastercard transactions are advertised and compared to crypto as being able to complete 3,000 transactions per second but this is not really true.  They can 'authorise' 3,000 transactions per second but the money is not actually delivered in this time.  This only happens when settlement goes through hours or days later and even then can still be reversed.
Many times these reversals happen and the retailer is left out of pocket due to fraud; for an online business this is very hard to mitigate as, unlike a bricks and mortar store, you have no visibility of the client's credit card that may be fraudulent.
So Visa and mastercard don't really provide 3000 TPS, they provide a promise rate probability of 99.5% of 3000 TPS that you should get your money.

You should look into the history of hyperinflation, it's caused by govs being too far in debt, like the US right now.
"The most well-known example of hyperinflation was during the Weimar Republic in Germany in the 1920s. First, the German government printed money to pay for World War I. From 1913 to the end of the war, the number of Deutschmarks in circulation went from 13 billion to 60 billion. The government also printed government bonds, which has the same effect as printing cash. Germany's sovereign debt went from 5 billion to 100 billion marks. At first, this fiscal stimulus lowered the cost of exports and increased economic growth.
When the war ended, the Allies saddled Germany with another 132 billion marks in war reparations.
Production collapsed, leading to a shortage of goods, especially food. Because there was excess cash in circulation, and few goods, the price of everyday items doubled every 3.7 days. The inflation rate was 20.9 percent per day. Farmers and others who produced goods did well, but most people either lived in abject poverty or left the country. (Source: "Germany in the Era of Hyperinflation," Der Spiegel, August 14, 2009.)"

the gov may not 'run' the fed reserve but it appoints the chairman.  Consider how the fed just prints money whenever the gov needs to raise capital with gov bonds, which is why us gov debt is 21 trillion.  They basically have full advantage of running the Fed. 
The 21 trillion debt is a massive bubble that will one day burst and come crashing down dragging the USD with it.  Most probably this will be occurring with hyperinflation, which is the usual end result of unsustainable gov debt.
