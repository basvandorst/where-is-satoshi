$30 would be your taxable profit.  
3 stages
 $10 profit when you first sold bitcoin
$10 loss when you sold eth
$30 profit when you sold bitcoin
Total $30 profit
Each profit or loss is taxable income or loss
However you can also affect your cost basis by deducting fees from your purchase or sale.
So if you had a $30 fee transaction on bitcoin
$20 loss on first sale
1O loss on ethnsale
O loss on second bitcoin sale
Total $30 loss
Edit. Doh stupid math mistake

By doing it with machines specifically set up to mine bitcoins. Plus you aren't getting the full proceeds from the transactions, plus they have to go to great trouble to keep their computers cool. Your computer isn't built for mining, you don't know if you have the proper cooling in place, and who knows how much this is going to affect the life of your PC.

Don't forget to take into account the wear and tear on your computer for having it running 24 hours a day.  How much sooner are you going to have to replace it?  Also, it says he made 1 penny in 12-15 minutes.  So 4 to 5 cents an hour or .96 to 1.24 a day.  So you are making 12 to 30 cents a day to allow someone to have access to your computer

The government doesn't regulate sterling or yen either yet you have to pay taxes on those

What does that have to do with anything?  You know drug dealers can go to jail for tax evasion too?  Look up al Capone. And no I'm not saying that trading in crypto currency should be illegal. Just that it is still income.

84 cents a day is about 25 dollars a month. Your parents aren't going to be happy

But the banks are regulated and there are ways to get the banks to comply with court orders. That's going to be tough with some of the bitcoin problems

Look at it this way. I've traded foreign currency before.  In the us if I trade my pounds for yen I still have to report the gain on sterling on my taxes.  Crypto currency wants to be considered currency, so the same rules apply

It's treated the same as any profits or losses in non US dollars. Why do you think it should be treated differently

Because property transactions still provide an easy trace of funds while crypto doesn't.
