I agree, but the reality goes back to my previous point. We say "don't put in what you're not willing to lose", but a lot of people still do it.

It's a serious question because markets are extremely volatile right now. I guess it boils down to choosing between 2 risks:
1. Keep your coins on an exchange and have it hacked and lose all your money.
2. Keep your coins on a private wallet and not be able to transfer to an exchange in time if the market turns against you.
Aside form the die hard holders, there are a lot of people on here that are newbies that might have put in a lot of money into bitcoin that they wouldn't be comfortable losing. We say "don't put in what you're not willing to lose", but a lot of people still do it. For those people, keeping the funds on the exchange in this particular situation might be the best option. I'm not advocating for keeping ANY coins on an exchange, but with the volatility of price and the state of the network, it might be the best option for some.

I have contacted them as well yes. I'm not even interested in converting to fiat, I just want seamless BTC integration. Unfortunately with a platform like squarespace I don't seem to have much flexibility and what processor I can use.
@_date: 2014-11-18 02:16:31
@_date: 2014-08-15 01:13:33
Perfect, thanks. Then to transfer cold storage would be:
1. Access qt wallet on an offline machine and write down the private key.
2. Generate a cold lite wallet, encrypt it and import private key on an offline machine.
3. Move cold lite wallet to online machine and sync.
Yes? I just want to be able to move my coins quickly if I need to, but I'm good with long term cold storage ATM.
Edit: One thing I dont quite understand with importing private keys... Doesn't the blockchain depend on one address sending bitcoin to another address to confirm ownership? If I import a private key by typing it into a new wallet, wont both wallets claim ownership of the key? Or am I thinking of this all wrong?

I think there's a typo in your comment but I think you mean, cant the bootleggers issue the same "thing" (ie. thing being colours bits that look like they're from the company).
I'm not 100% certain how coloured coins work but I would hope there is some way for one entity to able to issue coins specific for their task and no one else being able to issue the same coins. I've heard suggestions from the community where colours coins could be used to issues tickets to concerts and eliminate scalpers. If any coloured coin can simply be created by anyone who has bitcoin, this implementation would be impossible.

Nice Gox chart. Now take a look at a real exchange.
@_date: 2014-11-18 03:19:31
I guess you're right on both points.
The reason why I thought the first point might be useful is because internal inventories can be easily manipulated, however something stored on a public ledge that is verified by people not in any way tied to your business is much more secure. That's why I also think that solving such a small problem with this kind of solution might be overkill, but in reality if the implementation was simple enough, why not add that extra level of security?
For my second point, I think it's also important to recognize that doing this on the bitcoin blockchain instead of a private corporate ledger is useful because its independently verifiable. Lets say a 7-11 in Uganda was receiving a shipment of Coca Cola bottles. They could independently verify that the product they are receiving from the delivery truck that comes to their store is authentic by scanning the tags. It would otherwise be immensely impractical to have different systems to authenticate all the different products and brand names your company carries. However I do recognize that this sort of universal implementation is very very far away.

so.. whats the agenda here? i'm all for "spread the love", but there is an agenda here other than "spreading the love". you say you wont sell or abuse the information i give you in order to receive the "free bitcoin". so what will you do with it?
@_date: 2014-07-07 15:22:40
To clarify. Are you trying to buy something with these BTC or just hold? If you're just going to hold, and you see that the transaction went through on the blockchain, there is no need to go through the trouble of downloading the entire blockchain. Just open your wallet, go to receiving addresses and make sure you see the address your friend sent BTC to. Them simply back up your wallet.dat file and you're all set. In the future, when you do need to use the BTC, you can simply download the new blockchain and open your wallet.

I'm sure there are many applications. Lets say a retail location wants to better manage their inventory and security using the blockchain. They can equip all exit point in their warehouse/store with RFID sensors. Their stock would also be tagged with RFID tags that each uniquely identify on the blockchain. Whenever stock is taken in or out, their software can confirm that the item was paid for or was otherwise allowed to leave the warehouse/store. They can also keep more accurate inventory, and this information would be unalterable.
At the same time however, this implementation might feel a bit like overkill, and maybe a bit impractical because RFID tags can be removed.
Companies can also use colored coins to identify units that they produce to eliminate counterfeiting. It would be the same idea where you have an RFID tag or an NFC tag embedded in the product. If it has an invalid tag according to the blockchain, or has no tag at all, you cant say the product is "authentic".
With this implantation I think you will also run into a new form of crime where RFID/NFC tags are stolen instead of the product itself for the purpose of creating counterfeits (for example a bad actor can go around retail location cutting out the tags and embed them in counterfeits products). However that type of crime would also likely be easily managed because you can simply invalidate those tags as referring to authentic products because you know which ones were stolen. That would depend on  how accurately stock is tracked once its shipped to dealers/distributers.

Is it a transaction in or out? Check the address on the blockchain. As long as the transaction was verified by nodes and the address exists in your wallet file, your bitcoins are still there regardless of it syncing or not. If they were verified by nodes, they are no longer "pending".
@_date: 2014-11-15 22:46:57

looks like a really really cool idea. but it looks like it receives data from something called "outernet", which is something they created and likely have to maintain. in the video on their website, they talk about what it would be like if the internet suddenly disappeared and how outernet is suppose to fix this problem. well.. what if outernet disappears? its a centralized point of failure. it also only broadcasts data that was chosen to be broadcast by a human and one point. it would be so much cooler if it ate up all data that is floating in space without bias or choice. but then you also run into the problem of storage. i see no mention of capacity. im sure they can fit a fair bit in flash storage on that thing, but a fair bit in the world of storage, is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of content available on the internet.
this would be excellent if it did 2 thing:
1. "listened" for data from multiple forms of communication (radio, internet, tv etc.) without relying on a proprietary signal to receive such information.
2. somehow solved the issue of storing all the information (P2P cloud storage maybe?)

offline linux live cd/usb. generate an offline wallet on that, encrypt and backup. transfer to one or more of your addresses. or Trezor because its easier... but really if you are in any way "tech-savvy", the time you spend figuring out how to go the linux route will be faster than the time you spend waiting for you Trezor to arrive.

What do you mean by everything? Is that if "everything" collapsed? What does that really mean? In that case people would be liquidating "everything" for things they need. Food, water, shelter. So they would be exchanging their bitcoins for.... food, water and shelter. Dare I say, they would use it as a currency?
@_date: 2017-08-26 06:04:38
One argument I can think of is, only accept transactions as completed with no confirmations if they have a fee of X based on the current transactions in the mempool, sure. But if you scale out with 1mb blocks to a network where all merchants accepts Bitcoin, the fees become unreasonable.
Ok then we have another solution. Lighting Network. However this means the merchant and the customer would have to be in the same channel. I understand that anyone can join a channel, but you have to send a regular old transaction in order to get into the channel which also incurs a fee. And in order to transact with low fees, both the merchant and customer have to be on the same network. So how do you escape this?
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:32:46
You're not far off. SegWit enables Lightning.
One of the problems IMO is, Lightning Channels will be operated by individuals/corporations that you pay a subscription fee to in order to use the channel. In turn you get to use their channel to transact with no fees until you get your funds out of the channel. If there operators are in the US for example, I can see the government requiring KYC/AML for these operators since they are handling other peoples money. This creates some concern. In the beginning I can see some non-compliant operators being shut down and users losing funds. As things progress and operators become compliant, I can see there being only a few big players (corporations) that are fully compliant operating these channels. In this case users in the channel give up their privacy, anonymity and immutability of their transactions since the power that be require the operator to abide by KYC/AML and can shut them down if they fall out of line.

A block is 12.5 bitcoins at this time. That gets cut in half roughly every 4 years. When you mine with a pool and the pool solves a block, you get a fraction of the 12.5 bitcoin based on how much you contributed to the pools hash rate.
All of that being said, stop trying to mine with your GPU. You will destroy your GPU and get literally get pennies in return. I saw your other thread. You sound young. Are you living with your parents and perhaps using their electricity? All you will achieve with GPU mining is a dead GPU, and a sky high electric bill. 
You need an ASIC (actually several) if you intend to mine. And with that being said, if you save up the $200-$300 you said you want to save up and spend on an ASIC, just buy some bitcoin with that $200-$300, you'll do much better.

Yes. At first it might sound like that’s easy to brute force since it’s only 2048 words, but think of it this way (this isn’t completely accurate but close enough); imagine your 24 words seed as a 24 character password that uses an alphabet that contains 2048 different letters. Not trivial to brute force.

I'm sure there are, but you'll likely not hear much from them because people like to keep that sort of thing private. There was also a story about one guy in the UK that had a bunch of coins (1000+ iirc) on a hard drive that he tossed and the city put in a dump. He tried to search the dump but I don't imagine that he ever got them back.

Sure some of them probably do, but that doesn't mean you get to avoid currency rates in any way. In fact, a currency exchange kiosk or even your bank will probably give you a better rate on USD -&gt; CAD than the BTM will give you on USD -&gt; BTC -&gt; CAD.
Do some research on fees etc. of these BTMs and which ones are available where you are traveling.

There are supposedly ways to divide a bitcoin beyond the set 8 decimal places (hardfork).
Once all coins are mined, miners will be rewarded transaction fees. The thought is that by that time, the value of transaction fees will be enough to sustain miners.

The rise to $1000 was probably a little irrational, and we've been seeing it correct for over a year. But it's not completely unbelievable for this to happen with something as new and disruptive as bitcoin.
USD is the reserve currency of the world, you wouldn't exactly expect the same amount of volatility from it.. From historical charts, you can see that the rally is unusual. Even on a 25 year chart, there hasn't been such a rapid rally.
edit: in fact, if you look at the rally in the second half of 2008, it looks quite similar....
