datacenter mode ... 
My 4 year old laptop has a 256 GB SDD + 1TB 2.5" HDD.
How much is a 1 TB hard drive? $90?
On the data side - not every part of the world is stuck with lousy internet options (i.e. the US).
Meanwhile, how much will the price gouging from miners at present on transaction fees / or any future layer 2 solution (read: run by a centralised, for profit organisation) cost each and every user and merchant relying on bitcoin?

Yes you are right, please give your coins to me.

Would also like to know - sure to cause more panic and more selling and lower bottom. Check out the pending transactions and fees - store of wealth with tiny liquidity means all the talk of market cap is nonsense, as when a significant number of people come to sell they find they can't ... Core devs have gone out of their way to engineer BTC into a ponzischeme.
Wish there were more USD/fiat direct to altcoin exchanges as this is going to bring all of those down too.
