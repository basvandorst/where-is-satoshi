As a fan of Google, I'm very disappointed, realizing its not the Google it used to be.

What a fossil

Many events were held there during the 2013 north America bitcoin conference, one of the first businesses that accepte btc in MB.

I was disappointed too. And those major antivirus software companies.

Don't care. To those Russians who hold rubles not buying bitcoins, you deserve it.  It's simple as that.

Nope, he's deep in the hole, nothing can change him.

PBOC, you're pathetic. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:03:47
"select" not needed, if you paid bitcoin before, it becomes your default payment option :)

How about..... MarketP2P?
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:27:26
Thank you for your update. I have thousands of $$$ stuck on cryptsy as well. 
I actually have some sympathy toward those guys. Being one of their early customers, I think they tried to build a legit profitable business. Somewhat tragic to see this result.

Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet, Bill Gates and buddies came out in droves bashing bitcoin in early May, now it's down more than 1/3. They must have "done" something right, right? 
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:00:12
What I was really saying was these billionaires who REALLY hate bitcoins probably have found a way of suppressing it.  Do you think they'd just sit on their hands venting their hatred and doing nothing?

He HAS TO borrow 4~6 TRILLIONS just to keep his tax cut promises, let alone those infrastructure building, job-creating projects.  Go figure. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:00:42
pathetic and disgusting.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:24:01
go away china, we dont need you.

Since bigger mines are banned, smaller ones popping up?
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:31:46
Crypto world is tired of chinese policy makers' manipulation. they have lost all the credibility. bitcoin has banned china. 
whoever is foolish enough dealing with devil only have themselves to blame, when next round of crackdown happens.

Only if the voltage is high enough

Same feeling here. The creator of mastercoin loves MSC so much that he has to have 10 billion dollars in his checking account before he can quit his day job and work full time on the project, because the MSC queen doesnt give a shit to any non-paper currencies. Its almost funny. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:10:59
It's not 200, more like 16~17 ATM. Cost was 0.01 btc, now the offer is 0.16 btc. 
The market is really thin and trades are sporadic. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:31:32
I always liked colored coins better than mastercoin, but somehow that project has been awfully slow.
