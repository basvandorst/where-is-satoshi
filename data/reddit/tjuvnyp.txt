Hey, happy cakeday!

You should take into consideration that after a month and a half of Segwit activation (May 10), there has yet to be a single real Segwit transaction on litecoin. I don't think we will see bitcoin or litecoin blocks full of segwit transactions anytime soon.
There are a handful of Segwit transactions in the Litecoin blockchain, but they are all proof-of-concept. No one has actually used it yet.

I think they reset his gmail password by receiving a verification sms to his phone number, which they had taken over.

I have one of those lying around since Mt Gox. Can I reuse it?

That is because of witness data discount. An ordinary Segwit block can theoretically be ~ 4MB with the 1MB limit we have now (size vs weight). If you bump the limit to 2MB, you can get 8MB blocks. It's mostly theoretical though.

Will it be even that? Sources say less than 1%.

The whole piece:


trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible
services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.


allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers
from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In
this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The
system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any
cooperating group of attacker nodes.
**Obviously, the rising cost of mediation is used as an example of something that pre-bitcoin systems could not handle, but bitcoin could.**

Can anyone translate what they are singing and saying?

Sounds good. Looking forward.

If you recognize the melody, you've probably been playing **Tetris**.
